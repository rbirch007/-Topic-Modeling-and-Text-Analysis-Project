ARMISTICE HYMN
Hail! Day of Armistice, hail to the nations Quenching the fire of the thunderous guns; Ended the anguish of war's desolations Broken the strength of the terrible ones.
Hail to the warriors peacefully sleeping, Nameless or known in the cross-covered plains; Bow we with those who sit quietly weeping, Bearing their loss for the world's richer gains.
We will be keeping the tryst ye decreed us, Ye who lie under the wave and the sod; Watchful we stand, guarding all that has freed us, Resting our deeds in the judgment of God.
Hail Day of Brotherhood, hail to the morning Of the new day that has scarcely begun, When, o'er the earth in that glorious dawning. Goodwill shall triumph and all men be one.

The Editor Abroad
Egypt
Alice L. Reynolds
A trip of five days from the city of Marseilles brought my traveling companion and me to the city of Alexandria in Egypt. Meeting congenial people is one of the pleasures of travel, so that we were glad to discover, opposite us at our first meal on the steamship Sphinx, Mr. And Mrs. Kenneth Brown of Cambridge, Massachusetts. Mr. Brown, like Miss Elliott and myself, is a teacher; the English department of Harvard University being his place of service. We soon learned that Mr. And Mrs. Brown had in mind visiting the same countries that we expected to visit, so that our lot was happily cast together through the Orient. Long before our ship cast anchor in the harbor of Alexandria, the interest of this strange land had fastened itself upon us. The semi-circular, white city, as we saw it in the distance, nestled under a blue sky with the blue waters of the Mediterranean stretched before it, suddenly became alive with its "turbaned host," its jumble of strange houses, strange vehicles, and strange people with yet stranger languages and stranger cries. The temper of the Orient manifested itself in the small matter of taking our baggage to the customs and to the outgoing train for Cairo. Two men had been detailed to look after us, one from the travel bureau in Alexandria, with which we were connected, the other from the hotel where reservations had been made for us
566 THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE
in Cairo. One was a large, dark-skinned husky; the other, dark also, but of slender build. Both had been told to look after us and both seemed to take their commission most seriously. Instead of talking the matter over and seeing where the mistake occurred, they began fighting for possession. The small man suspecting he would be outmatched by the large one, watched his chance hoping to creep up to the baggage and get it when the other was not looking. On one of these attempted "sneaks" on the part of the small man, they got into a real fight which resulted in the larger gaining control. At the height of the contest, Mrs. Kenneth Brown stepped quickly behind the big burly fellow, saying as she did so, "I know nothing of the 'rights' or 'wrongs' in this matter, but I am going to stay by the big man; he is the best fighter." As we rode along from Alexandria to Cairo the skyline was broken by long stately rows of date palms, and by a moon of extraordinary size. On reaching Cairo we were received at the door of our hotel by a man in an elegant Oriental costume of white and lemon-colored silk, with the appropriate number of spangles and dangles on his headgear. We found our beds completely enveloped in soft, white, double mosquito netting, which
THE EDITOR ABROAD 567
looked regal enough, we thought, to have been the bed of Cleopatra. Still better things awaited us. Egypt retains the past and takes on the present. The next morning, stepping from our room on to a veranda, we were aware that we were on the most important street of Cairo. What we saw was a veritable moving picture; a street pageant whose parts needed only to be closed up a bit to make it one of the most splendid of pageants, and this was the real thing. In all probability the streets of Cairo are the most interesting streets in the world. Here are some of the things to be seen from a veranda or window: women wearing the veil which is usually black, although it is occasionally white, and is held in place by a very large, yellow spool that stretches across the forehead and attaches to the headpiece, holding it in place. The Oriental uses his head (or more frequently it is her head) for whatever is to be carried; consequently, we saw in the group women with water bottles on their heads. Sometimes they carried baskets full of vegetables, and once we saw a woman with a box containing live chickens upon her head. It is customary for women to carry children on their shoulders; indeed, one of the picturesque sights of the Orient is that of a woman carrying a small child upon her shoulder. Jostled together, pedestrians and equestrians alike, we saw, on this same street, donkeys trudging along, bearing sometimes a man in a simple white garment, with the usual headpiece held by a cord, and sometimes a man with an inner and outer garment that suggested a flowing robe. The camel with his stately stride, his head held high and his long neck decorated with strands of blue beads to keep away the evil eye, always attracts attention. Every conceivable sort of vehicle may be seen, from a rumbling old wagon to an up-to-date automobile. Now and again one sees a type of carriage that suggests the elegance of the past, carrying a woman in a white gown, profusely decorated with gold and silver ornaments. Our guess was that she was an Egyptian bride, although, through our American eyes, she looked very much like a person dressed for a fourth of July pageant. Yet this street was to take on a much more colorful appearance later in the day. A very short distance from our hotel was Shepherd's
568 THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE
hotel; the haunt of the fashionable tourist. In front of this. Hotel, particularly during the season, the guides, who seem to have adopted the stock name of "Moses," congregate. Their garments attract a good deal of attention as they are usually of very brilliant colors. Blue seemed to be a favorite color with them: whether it is worn by them as by the camels to keep the evil eye away we did not learn. These guides had as a rule both the inner and outer garment, and wore upon their heads the red cap with the black tassel, prevalent in Mohammedan countries?the hat that marks the man of the east for Americans. We include a description of the costume of our guide because he was exceptionally well dressed. His outer garment was of broadcloth, mustard-color; his inner garment was of silk, with a golden brown pin stripe upon a creamy background. A girdle of crushed silk, that harmonized with the robe, held the inner garment at the waist. About his neck he wore a scarf of Damascus silk, having a wine-colored-background and a border of green and silver stripes. The fringe, elaborate in character, was of black tied with silver. The red cap, with the black tassel common to his country, blended into the colors of his costume, making it harmonious and unusually effective. He was a very intelligent young man speaking English with scarcely an accent. His people came from Sudan. The English people, in Egypt, say the inhabitants of Sudan are to be preferred to the Egyptians; our guide would seem to bear out this contention. He was in all probability a Mohammedan, as he reacted very quickly in one of the mosques when a tourist, no doubt striving to be witty, asked if the camels were allowed within the mosques. On the instant, our guide replied, "Yes, and the donkeys also." Still not all the interesting sights were to be seen on this street of well known hotels. One of the strangest sights in Egypt is that of the water carrier, bending low under the burden of a goat skin full of water thrown across his back. This sight may be seen on the side streets at most any time. When we visited the graves of the Mamelukes we saw a man pouring water from the neck of a goat skin on the lawn. Then, too, the vendors of all sorts, so characteristic of Eastern and Italian life, lend color and motion to the scene, as well as a
THE EDITOR ABROAD 569
good deal of noise by their varied cries. We could not make our way along the street without being stopped by boys, with brush in hand, perchance at the entrance to a mosque, in front of the king's palace, or the great museum, who told us of the dust upon our shoes. These vendors carry many things upon their shoulders which they offer for sale. In fact, anything from an armful of Oriental rugs to a small boxful of green and brown beetles which they declare are genuine scarabs, although it is generally known that they are manufactured. Beads are always in evidence, although the mummy beads are perhaps most frequently offered to tourists.
570 THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE
The bazaars of Cairo are interesting. There, in the midst of dirt and dust, and sometimes ragged denizens of the street, one sees shops displaying most attractive wares: charming necklaces, bracelets, scarfs of gold and silver sheen, as well as many lovely bronzes. / The camel is the great carry-all of this part of the country. Practically all people know how useful it is upon the desert, while not so many people are acquainted with its great usefulness in the inhabited parts. If a young woman is married, the wedding train may consist of the bride mounted upon a camel, followed by more camels loaded with the furniture she will place in her home. Camels take the place of the moving van in the east: we were told that even so bulky a piece of furniture as a piano is sometimes strapped to a camel's back. On the country roads they are sometimes seen carrying boxes of live chickens, great bundles of cotton, hay, boxes of oranges, in fact anything and everything that needs to be carried. Intermingled with all these things that are so typically Oriental, one sees the electric tram, the railroad train, perchance the latest make of automobile, and over and above all, he hears the whir of the aeroplane. Egypt owes its past, stretching far into the centuries behind us, as also its present, to the Nile river. This great river is reached in a few minutes from Cairo, either by a tram car or an automobile. On reaching it one's attention may be drawn to many things: our party took delight in the picturesque sail boats that still ply its waters, and in the flowers that we found in full bloom in the month of February. Modern means of transportation brings the great pyramids very close to the city of Cairo. On our way to the pyramids we past villages whose mud dwellings would look familiar to Joseph or Moses, so the historian tells us. These monuments of stone have excited admiration and wonder throughout the centuries, and it is fairly safe to say that they will continue to do so as long as they grace the earth. As the sun sank behind them into the desert, and as the moon cast its mellow light upon them, there came to us thoughts of the days when the Patriarchs Abraham and Joseph knew them.
THE EDITOR ABROAD 571
It is a fact worthy of note that many of the most "noteworthy architectural developments of the world take their origin from the cult of the dead. Of all the mighty Pharaohs who ruled in Egypt, only one has left us a fragment of his palace, but scarce one was so careless of his mortal remains that his tomb is not preserved to this day. Nay, more, we have tombs of every class?tombs of personages from the humblest to the most exalted, and we can trace step by step their evolution from the simple 'mound of sand to the mighty pyramid?the most colossal of all human buildings." (This paragraph is taken from Mr. H. H. Powers' book on Egypt.) The largest of these pyramids is the great pyramid of Cheops, covering thirteen acres. A stone's throw from this great pyramid, one finds golf links, and close to it, in another direction, excavations are being carried on by Harvard University. At no great distance from this mighty pyramid is the Sphinx. Just what this mysterious Sphinx represents has been a matter of constant controversy, and opinions still remain so varied as to its origin that they are not worthy of quoting in this article. However, we cannot pass it by without one observation which touches once again the destructiveness of war. It is a regretable fact that Napoleon's soldiers, while in Egypt, levelled their guns at the nose of this mighty monument, that had stood through the ages, and partly destroyed it. We now turn for a few moments to the city of Cairo, which
572 THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE
was a rival of both Bagdad and Damascus at the time when Moslem culture and Arab splendor covered that part of the world. It was during this period that the mosques of Cairo were built, and the tombs of the caliphs. It is evident that the architecture of the mosque follows the architecture of the Christian east, resembling churches to be found in Russia, Constantinople, and even the well-known Church of St. Marks in Venice. It is different from them in that it adds the minaret which is said to be the only contribution that the Moslem world has made to architecture. One of the finest mosques in the city of Cairo is the mosque of Sultan Hasan. The minarets of Cairo are different from the minarets of Constantinople, which were built at a later period. They are elaborate in form and produce a distinctively picturesque quality that characterizes the Orient. The Arab has always had a mania for covering his architecture with patterns. In order to distinguish Arab decorations from other decorations, they are spoken of as Arabesque. The mosque of Sultan Hasan is the grandest of all the mosques of Cairo, but the tomb of Kait Bey is the most exquisite of all the mosques. The dome and minaret of this mosque are exceptionally fine examples of the Arabesque
THE EDITOR ABROAD 573
decorations. Every mosque has its prayer niche on the pillared side, and the ablution fountain in the center which the Mohammedan uses freely before he goes in to pray. In the mosque of el-Azhar is the University of Cairo, the largest Moslem institution in the world. It was built in the tenth century and is exceedingly large, following the usual plan of an open court with covered colonades along the sides. In the covered part, which is ten colonades deep, sit the students, ranging from little children to gray-haired men, all swaying to and. Fro as they strive to commit to memory the words of the Koran, or seek to understand the explanations made by their teachers who sit garbed in flowing robes, with turbans upon their heads. Without a doubt the most attractive modern building in Cairo, and for that matter, most likely in all Egypt, is the great museum. This museum has been very properly characterized "an epitome of ancient Egypt." In it one finds at the present time beautiful alabaster vases that have been taken from King Tuthankhamen's tomb, as well as many other articles of interest. Everywhere one sees the elaborately decorated sarcophagus of the mummy with a mummy inside. Sometimes, these mummies have gold rings upon their fingers. Very early in the visit to the museum one encounters long shelves covered with black cats that at a distance would deceive the spectator and lead him to believe that they had just perched themselves upon the shelves for inspection, were it not for the fact that they are so deathly still. Nearby these shelves of black cats are shelves of dogs, and in other parts of the museum one may see mummies of crocodiles and of the Sacred Bull. It is impossible when looking at the Sacred Bull not to be reminded of the custom that was in the minds of the children of Israel when they fashioned in the desert a golden calf at the time when Moses, their leader, was in communication with the Lord of Hosts. Egypt is an intensely interesting country, not alone because of the great variety of scenes that present themselves on every side, but because it is the pathway of civilization for many centuries. "Truth shall spring forth from the earth." Practically every day something is being extracted from the sands of Egypt, revealing the splendor of other days. In no other Country could the mummies of men and animals have been preserved as in this land where the Nile has been the source of its vegetation, its luxuriant trees and beautiful flowers, but behind which are countless acres of sunburned sand. Diet for the School Child By Jean Cox, State Supervisor of Home Economics Education The diet of the school child is the most important single factor for its success in school. From careful studies made by Dr. Emerson Holt and others on the relationship between failure, retardation and special promotion, to height and weight, there is a very marked correlation. From a study made in Washington, D. C., of boys and girls who had had one or more special promotions up to the eighth grade, every one of these pupils weighed a little more than the weight recorded in tables showing the average weight for height. This margin of safety increases resistance, tends to stabilize the nervous system and is probably the result of good food habits, regular meals, adequate sleep, and other indications of living up to the rules of the health game. Where a successful school lunch has been put into operation there is usually a noticeable improvement in the grades made by the children. This is particularly noticeable where the child is on the border line of malnutrition. The extra amount of milk, vegetables and milk dishes usually served in the school lunch are a valuable contributing factor toward turning probable failure into success, both in terms of weight and school progress. The warm dish tends to relieve fatigue, stimulates flow of digestive juices and also makes the box lunch more palatable. Unfortunately the average school lunch available is almost worse than none at all. Highly seasoned meats in terms of hot dogs, candy bars, unbuttered sandwiches, soda pop, and often poor quality pie or ice cream, are not suitable for food for the growing child. Too often, too, the price of school lunch dishes is excessive for their value. It is indeed unfortunate that more Parent Teacher Associations, or other women's organizations, do not sponsor an adequate school lunch. It has been done successfully in several districts in the State. For the past two years, for instance, some of the mothers in Cedar City, anxious to have their children, who had some distance to go to school, enjoy their lunches, have cooperated with the homemaking teacher and worked out the following plans: l These parents have furnished the materials so that at least one nutritious hot dish has been served to their children to supplement the cold lunch brought from home. One of the interesting things about this lunch project is that very little money has been used in exchange for school lunches. When a family kills an animal, meat for roast, boiling, stew or soup is sent to the department after arrangements have been made with the foods DIET FOR THE SCHOOL CHILD 575 teacher. The same organization holds with vegetables, butter and milk. One family who produced a dependable quality of milk delivered a gallon a day which more than paid for the hot lunch dishes served several children during the year. This school lunch prepared by girls in their regular foods classes has become an institution. One of the requirements for the teacher of the present year was that she must be able to handle the school lunch problem. What has been done in this community can without doubt be done in other communities. Another interesting result of this experiment is that there is a general belief that children who have the hot dish are doing better work and are in better physical condition than. They would otherwise be. Iron county, by the way, ? is doing some of the best health work being done in the state. They are making concerted, consistent, and determined efforts to have their children free to gain and free to learn. There is much psychology connected with the feeding of the school child, for in the excitement of getting to school on time many high strung, nervous children are too much "on edge" to really enjoy their meals. This is especially true where family meals are not very regular and inclined to be late. Meals should be served on the minute so that children will be trained to feel that there is plenty of time for them to eat their meal, get to school without running and. Still have a little time for play. Permanent physical injury results where the needs of the school child as to meal time are not given careful consideration. Too often mothers allow some of the mechanics of housekeeping to overshadow their responsibility of feeding their school children so that they will be unquestionably healthy and happy. Special care should be exercised over the six-year-old who, when school begins, enters a new world. Going to school for a child of this age is an advent which overshadows past experience. Moreover, the excitement of getting to school is very apt to interfere with the appetite for breakfast. The wise mother will, therefore, quietly give the child to understand that breakfast is quite as important as school, and that unless the child eats fruit, cereal, milk, toast and possibly a little egg or bacon, that he will become too tired before 12 o'clock comes to do good work. A vigorous protest should be entered against the carelessness of some mothers who allow children to run hurriedly to school with only a piece of dry bread or bread and jam, half of which they are apt to throw away as they run. One nutrition worker sums up her regard for this shiftless responsibility by saying: 'Parents who do not see to it that school children have an adequate breakfast, in peace, ought to be required to go without food for a least twenty-four hours." If all of the mothers in Logan and vicinity, who have had the 576 THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE opportunity of hearing Dr. McCollum the past two summers, will live up to nutrition requirements set by him of a quart of milk a day, ten drops of cod liver oil twice a week, green leaf vegetables, root vegetables, citrus and fresh fruits, they will have the right to expect noticeably a more sturdy and successful group of children than the average. A satisfactory nutrition program backed by enthusiastic public opinion is not of overnight growth. Poor food habits cannot be so easily changed. There must be a gradual conversion to new principles, an interest in new foods or food combinations aroused, and a firm belief that the change in food habits is worth while. Many people have the idea that their children are free from rickets, anemia, and other striking evidences of malnutrition. This is not always the case. There is far too much evidence in every community of malnutrition in nervous, high-strung children, noticeable rachitic changes in bones, and apparent anemia in many little boys and girls of all ages, for anyone to feel self-satisfied with the average child's health. In many cases the health standards of a family or community are too low. Many people believe that living in the country insures good health although this is not always borne out by health clinic records. More parents need to feel a distinct pride in feeding children with the definite aim in view to obtain solid, well shaped teeth, straight bones of good average size, red blooded-and steady nerves. The noon meal, which is generally considered to be the best time to serve dinner where there are children, should always be served on time. Further, it should be a well-balanced menu to meet the needs of the group. Usually this meal should include bread and butter, meat or meat substitute, two vegetables, other than potato, preferably one of the green leaf vegetables, or it may be used in a simple salad, and a simple dessert. Milk should also be used, if there isn't generous use of milk in the vegetables or dessert. Some mothers may think this is impossible. It isn't for the average home as the cost isn't as much more as is usually supposed if careful selection is made in terms of cost. Usually, too, an appreciable saving may be effected if storage facilities for root vegetables make the purchase of these in large amounts possible. Almost anyone can have a box of sand in a basement to keep these vegetables from drying up. A sufficient amount of these vegetables can be cooked at one time for two meals. Keep them in a cool place, and do not add butter or sauce to the unserved portion, or it will have a warmed-over taste when it is served. If all of the housekeepers would only believe that two vegetables and a simple dessert are easier than one vegetable and two desserts or one elaborate dessert there would be less objection to the DIET FOR THE SCHOOL CHILD 577 extra vegetable requirement which is a better means of health insurance. The following short cuts may help those belonging to the "Doubting Thomas Group." Cookies are usually easier for the sweet bit at the end of the meal than cakes. Plain cakes may be given a quick icing effect by sprinkling sugar with a bit of cinnamon in it before the cake is baked. Many housekeepers make a five-cup batch of fondant and pack in pint fruit jars. When cake icing is desired they take some of this, warm slightly, thin with a very little cream and spread on top of the cake. A variety of easy puddings should be in the recipe catalog of every housekeeper. There are almost an endless number of sego, rice, and bread puddings that may be varied by using brown sugar, honey, or carmelizing part of the granulated sugar. For flavoring, add a little ginger with a little vanilla or lemon, or add raisins, cocoanut, a few rolled peanuts, chopped figs or dates; dried peaches or apricots that have been soaked may be added for variety. Puddings composed largely of milk and eggs are also a very valuable part. Of the supper menu. May a plea be made for one hot dish for the supper when the weather is not warm. This is also a satisfactory means of serving part of the vegetable requirement. Frequently the supper of bread and milk and fruit is inadequate without the addition of a cream soup, warmed over vegetable, or a more concentrated dessert than fresh or stewed fruit. The extra enjoyment of the meal and the general feeling of happiness which results are much more worth while. Every family having electric lights should have some electrical or other contrivance whereby a quick hot dish can be prepared without making a fire in the range. Some housekeepers, mindful of their families' welfare, slowly cook rice or cereal in milk during the preparation of the noon meal, and then use the electrical or oil stove for heating it. While this is not an ideal way, proper health standards are worth consideration. Proper feeding of school children is one of the best means of keeping down taxes, because there will be fewer failures and less retardation. In our average sized school district this might easily mean one or more extra teachers who are required to struggle against malnutrition, lassitude and irritability which result when the child is not receiving food right in amounts and kinds. Some may question this, but careful experiments have been carried on to show that a proper kind of school lunch actually pays the school board. If care is exercised over all of the meals, isn't it reasonable to believe that it will not only pay the school district to have intelligent mothers, but won't it also pay the family, community and nation to have well nourished husky youngsters to carry on the work of tomorrow? 578 THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE Aside from food, the next biggest factors for the health of the school child are sleep and sunshine. Every elementary school child should have eleven hours of sleep. Those in junior high school should have at least ten hours, and high school boys and girls should average nine hours as a minimum requirement. Neither adult nor child can do satisfactory work with an inadequate amount of healthy restful sleep in rooms with windows wide open Unfortunately, many children suffer from too little sleep and as a result have to be almost pulled out of bed to get them awake. This is unfortunate and should be remedied by having more hours of sleep in the earlier part of the evening. As a means of safeguarding health, every child should have opportunity of playing in the sunshine every day. There is some good argument for short sleeves and socks which expose the wrists, elbows and knees of the normal rapidly growing child. Direct sunlight helps to prevent rickets, Sun therapy is becoming more and more important. It is possible that sun baths will be found to prevent and cure many of the diseases from which children and adults suffer, at the present time. Why all the emphasis on more vegetables and milk? The answer is that the newer medicine is prevention rather than cure. The new dietetics also aims to prevent illness in the baby. Obesity, or emaciation in the child or adult, anemia or rickets in children or adults. Everyone should realize that anemia and rickets are decidedly nutritional diseases. Prevention of one or both have been discussed in these articles. No less authority than Dr. McCollum states that if everyone would live up to the rules of positive health that rickets could be stamped out among small children in two years' time. The scars on older children will remain, but some headway could be made. Anemia and rickets are often found together, for both result from inadequate diet. The following accepted height and weight tables recently compiled by Drs. Wood and Baldwin were printed by the American Child Health Association and are worth careful consideration. Every child should be encouraged to have a margin of safety of a few pounds over weight, rather than being content with being underweight. Mothers should know whether or not their children's weight for height and for years is approximately normal: The tables are to be used as follows: Take for example, a 14 year old boy who is 64 inches tall. By following the numbers horizontally opposite the figure 64 it will be found that he should weigh 113 pounds. A 12 year old boy who is 64 inches tall should weigh 109 pounds, and an 18 year old boy should weigh 126 pounds.

The words 'world's deep night," are significant, suggesting, as they do, great precision in their selection. In the blaze and dazzle of our 20th century civilization it is difficult to realize how much superstition and spiritual darkness is to be found in our so-called up-to-date world. After spending a year abroad amid sights and sounds that for the most part please, we have often been greatly pained and profoundly shocked at the depth of superstition that tells of the world's deep night. For instance, there is a city in Germany that claims to be in possession of the bones of the three magi. If one visits that city some one is pretty sure to point to a certain gate, forming part of the old walls of the city, and in all solemnity say that the bones of the three magi were brought through that gate into the city. The visitor may see a silver box resembling in shape the Noah's Arks children play with, made of solid silver and very elaborately decorated with statues of saints. This most extraordinary box was made in the 12th century for the express purpose of forming a fitting receptacle for the bones of the magi. That box is being exhibited at a summer Exposition in Europe. It is marvelous as a specimen of 12th century art, but terrible as an example of religious belief. To be sure, none of the readers of the Magazine will believe
582 THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE
for an instance that this German city ever had the bones of the magi, the absurdity of the whole thing will dawn upon any one who gives it a moment's thought, yet this is only one of the instances that might be cited of claims that can have no foundation in truth, of superstitions that bind the minds and hearts of men, and keep them from finding the Lord. Hence the gratitude that should fill the heart of every Latter-day Saint, that we have been taken away from this superstition and that our lot has been cast among the virgin hills and blue skies, and above all else that the gospel has been brought to us and that through it we have been delivered from the bondage of ignorance. This editorial will reach our readers soon after the October conference. At that conference we heard as we have heard in many conferences of the past, clear expositions of the truth as revealed through our latter-day prophets. Against the background of superstition and gross ignorance that may be found in some parts of the world, the latter-day gospel is as a sunburst, giving joy to all who are made partakers of it. Happy the individual and happy the people who are convinced of its truth. Surely the splendor and the glory of the Lord is descended upon them.
Armistice Day
Seven years will have elapsed, on November 11, since the plenipotentiaries of the German nation met General Foch in the beautiful forest of Compeigne and signed the Armistice that brought to a termination active hostilities in Europe. The memory of the horrors of the war seems to be so deeply implanted in the minds of the present generation that Armistice Day appears to be the most solemn day in all the year in European nations. It is not to be wondered at, for there in the open country near the fort at Verdun, four hundred thousand men fell whose bodies are unidentified, and whose bones have been gathered together and placed in a temporary ossuary. Behind the temporary building is a permanent building that is being erected by interested contributors from all over the world to be the receptacle for the bones of the men who died on the field of battle. In this building are various altars?altars where the Roman Catholic prays according to his convictions, and altars where those of Protestant persuasions can offer their devotions in accord with their idea of acceptable worship. It is, to put it in a blunt and crude way, a place of a jumble of bones. Everybody knows that in the Roman Catholic division they likely have many bones of Protestants, and in the Protestant division there are bones of many
EDITORIAL 583
Roman Catholics. These bones have been placed in boxes somewhat resembling a coffin in shape, but very much smaller in size. They are covered with a white cloth and flowers, and wreaths are constantly placed upon them by relatives and visitors who go there. At no great distance from the ossuary is a section where a group of soldiers died standing, with bayonets in hand. A shellburst, buried them just as they stood. The bayonets extend above the ground and a monument has been built around, with a canopy overhead to offer protection to the steel from inclement weather. It is a ghastly sight?one that stirs to the very depth? presenting a horrible picture of some of the terrible realities of the last war. There is no honor that can be paid these men that they have not merited through their sacrifice, but all the honor that we can pay them through laurel wreaths and flowers and the devotion of our lips and hearts is of little use unless we set to work to find the remedy for this most terrible of curses that has beset civilization in all periods of the world and which looms up in particular horror at this present time.
Home Again
After one year we are again back in the office, breathing the pure air of our mountain home. Frequently we met tourists on our travels who had visited the West. At such meetings we were pleased to note that they always had complimentary things to say about it. In Ireland on a stroll leading to the Killarney Lakes, there were three persons in the group, one from New York, one from Indiana and one from Ohio who had visited Utah, each in turn remarked upon the cleanliness of Salt Lake City. We are happy once more to greet the Magazine readers from our office in the Bishop's Building. During our sojourn we have communicated with you from France, Italy, Egypt, Syria, Switzerland, England, Ireland and Wales, so that word has reached you from many lands and from many climes. Asia, Africa and Europe are interesting, and it is a great privilege to visit places of such profound concern in the history and development of our world civilization, but it is equally gratifying at the end of such a sojourn, to have a home to come to such as we have in the valleys of the mountains. We certainly feel to exclaim, "God bless our mountain home so dear," with the writer of our hymn. We shall continue the travel articles until we have covered the countries visited, changing the caption to suit the circumstances. However, the article appearing in this issue of the Magazine will retain the old caption as it was written abroad.

Condolence
Our sympathy is extended, at this time, to Mrs. Elsie Chamberlain Carroll whose gifted and devoted husband passed on, September 30, 1925. Mrs. Carroll is, as President Harris, of the Brigham Young University, asserted at the funeral services of her husband, one of the best writers the State of Utah has produced. She has been a constant contributor to the Relief Society Magazine and in this her hour of sore trial the members of the General Board extend heartfelt sympathy to her, In the midst of her sorrow, she must have great satisfaction in the knowledge that she was an inspiration to her husband, and that through his skill, he was enabled to relieve pain and bring comfort and cheer to those who suffered and were in distress. We pray that the choice blessings of our heavenly Father may rest upon her and her son and daughter, and that she may realize in full measure the promises made by our heavenly Father to those who are bereft.
My Prayer
Juanita Pulsipher
Help me, oh, Lord, to be Grateful for life in its beautiful wholeness; Help me to see That the valleys of gloom, the shades somber and dark, The sorrow, the anguish, that tears at the heart, The pain of remorse, the sharp pangs of grief, Are but shadows that throw into bolder relief Its high lights: The joy of achievement, The untold contentment Of hard, honest work, of victories won, The satisfaction of services willingly done, The happiness brought by love's rosy glow, Or support of a friend, understanding and true. Help me to say That, blended, they make a harmony sweet; A picture, not perfect, but grandly complete.

Gwen Keridan's color scheme?the one with which the fairies had endowed her at the christening?fortunately was that delectable combination of gold and sapphire, white and rose, which is the despair of every other girl; and she had the red mystery for lips that all beauty specialists search in boxes for. It was especially nice of the fairies to have picked Gwen for their gifts to adorn, as her extremely hard-worked salary, as stenographer at the offices of Bryce and Weldon, interior decorators, would never have consented to stretch itself far enough to pay for the mixtures and marcels which the other girls made use of, to show Mother Nature that she hadn't hurt their feelings so much after all in forgetting to touch them up in the days when she had them in her care. Gwen's salary considered itself very obliging to pay for all it did?rent of a tiny flat, food for Gwen and the crippled sister, and for clothes for both, besides tooth-paste, stamps, and the papers and magazines which Marcia needed so desperately to keep her from brooding over her condition. And Gwen never ceased being grateful to the responsible party, though she was a bit hazy as to its identity, for her blessings in the matter of complexion, natural waves, and the slim, graceful form which had the magic power of making her clothes and hats look, the minute she put them on, as if they had cost at least four times what they really had, and might even have been tailored expressly for her. This very satisfactory and comforting state of affairs gave Gwen an expression of radiant, care-free, girlish, happiness; and Marcia, lying flat on her back all day long, often stopped reading just to shut her eyes and see before her that merry, beloved little face, and hear in her mind's ear the ripple of low, sweet laughter that always seemed to be throbbing in Gwen's throat, waiting for release. Sometimes Marcia would say her prayers in the middle of the day, so that she could say, "Thank you. Lord, for Gwen's loveliness and laughter,' and she felt sure that it didn't sound flippant in the realms above. Marcia had so much time to think that she regarded it as a special dispensation of Heaven that she had so perfect a thing as Gwen to think about. Before the accident. Which had resulted in the injury to her spine, and the consequent complete helplessness, she had considered Gwen an adorable child who should never know anything but careful loving, and a chance to study all
586 THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE
the good and beautiful things in the world. She had been given the sacred charge of raising the little sister, and she would fulfil it gloriously. She would work hard and well, that the life-insurance money, left them at the death of their father, need not be touched until Gwen was ready for college. Then had come the dreadful accident; and every plan and hope had been shattered. The life-insurance money paid for the doctor, gave Gwen a short business course, and left enough in the bank to keep them from starving in case Gwen took sick or lost her job. Ever since then the position of the two was reversed. Gwen had been given Marcia's old position, and was financier, manager, cook, housemaid, and general comforter and joy-dispenser. Marcia's little world consisted of that part of the little home within her range of vision from the couch in the corner of it?and Gwen. She read things, of course, and always had interesting things to talk to Gwen about during the enchanting evenings when just the two of them were there together, but it was all vicarious experiences of book and story people, scientific experiments of unknown men, culinary achievements of unknown women. It seemed to her that Gwen's most ordinary word was more vital than anything in any book, for she lived in a world of real, live people. Who spoke aloud, wore actual clothes, and walked along cement sidewalks. Marcia lived for those conversations. "Sis," Gwen would say, "Marg West came into the office this morning and she had on a sleeveless dress, and gloves only to her wrists! Can you picture it? When I looked up and saw the endless length of freckled arm, I was utterly terrified!" or "Marcia, honey, you could never guess what we're having for supper, so don't try! I've decided that the potato is to lowly a food for us of the aristocracy, so shrimp salad shall be our portion from now on!" and Marcia, observing that Gwen left the house twenty minutes earlier than usual each morning of the following week, knew that she was walking to work, to save the extra dimes that the salad had cost, but she said not a word to show that she knew. That would have spoiled the whole thing, for Gwen loved planning little surprises. Sometimes they were not so little, either, but she liked to suppose that Marcia had no idea of them. Of course, they were as transparent as plate glass, and Marcia adored her for them. The phonograph had been the biggest of all. It had taken the money for her winter coat, and a dollar a week all winter beside. The breezy assertion that the old coat was in better style than when it was new. Tossed off so lightly, might have convinced a less understanding person, but Marcia knew that many a day during the coldest weather there was an unnatural bulge to Gwen's
GOLDEN-ROD 587
trim appearance, denoting a sweater under her coat. And every time the slightly rasping notes of the records fell upon her ear Marcia thought of the bulgy sweater, and tears of something like worship filled her eyes, and frequently dripped down so plentifully that she had to turn her pillow over. It was an evening in June that Gwen spoke the word her sister had half dreaded for some time. It came with studied casualness. "Marcia, do you remember my telling you last winter that Mr. Weldon's son had come into the office? He is to be taken into the firm, if he makes good, 'L. J.' his father calls him, so we all do the same, to save confusion. Well, I'm to be his private secretary when he needs me, and have a desk in a little room with the two other secretaries, instead of the outer office, and my salary is raised fifteen a month, and I love my work with him! Isn't it nice?" "Gwennie, it's gorgeous!" Nobody could have found anything lacking in the quality of Marcia's vocal enthusiasm, but her heart had dropped several degrees. The epoch-making 'fifteen a month' had been mentioned incidentally and the italics put upon the fact of loving to work with him. It was sure to come some day, that love that would crown the life of one girl and leave the other's desolate, but the fear that this might be the beginning, turned her cold and a little sick. Though not a breath of her dread tarnished the golden sincerity of her voice, as she repeated the formula. "Gwen, it's utterly gorgeous!" And in the following month, when no further mention was made of 'L. J.' Marcia's fear was quieted. Then, suddenly, "Marcia dear, would you mind much if 'L. J.' came here some evening to talk things over with us? (Marcia loved her for the 'us.) He is doing a couple of houses all by himself, and he has an idea that we can help out with the question of window-drapes. I've made a suggestion or two he seemed to like, and have told him how you are always reading up on such things, so he is anxious for a little help. You see, these are the houses to decide his fate. If they are right, he's to be taken into partnership, so you can't blame him for being worried, can you?" No, Marcia couldn't, and she'd enjoy having him come some time, she was sure. "I've told him to come on Friday." "All right, that's fine. Sometimes I've fairly ached to have a finger in a business pie again. When I was with Bryce and Weldon half my waking hours were spent in planning colors and curtains for their houses, though I'll have to admit that they
588 THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE
didn't often use my ideas. Bring him along." and Marcia resolved that she would bite her tongue off before it should ever utter a syllable that might tell of the chill in her heart. She must always pretend that she enjoyed it completely, looked forward to the times when "L. J." would come with his sample of chintz and velour, and his sketchbook. It was a chance to repay to Gwen a part of the debt she owed for these years of comraderie and laughter. In due time "L. J." was brought along, and the evening really was not bad at all. There was a great deal of fun batted. Back and forth, for young Weldon proved to be that boyish, poised, simple clever sort of American who puts everyone at ease immediately, by being so completely there himself. Marcia was included in every word that was spoken, and felt herself being really interesting to the young aspirant for a place in the firm. She was thankful not to be conscious of the sense of her own superfluousness which she had feared. Her ideas on home decorating were good, and, thanks to her reading-habit, very up-to-date and helpful. "L. J." was amazed at the amount of information she had at her command, and said so several times. Gwen served lemonade and cookies of her own making, of which their guest partook so freely that they feared he might be ill, but he seemed to have no such qualms, and went on eating. "By George," he declared, with vim, "I've not tasted such cookies since I used to loot Grandmother Weldon's cookie jar! Where do you find 'em, I'd like to know?" "Make them, kind sir," replied Gwen demurely, and found herself coloring foolishly at the look he shot at her. Marcia saw that look, too, and while she knew it to be one of admiring, friendly interest, she wanted men to have for Gwen, it shut her out, imperceptibly. The next time he came, it was with an armful of gleaming Golden-rod. Gwen was ecstatic. "Marcia, look! Golden-rod! It's just like we used to find up on Tompie's Trail before it was out anywhere else, and after it had quit blooming farther down in the valley. It makes me think my little-girl days are back again. It's?Golden-rod!" "L. J." appeared well-pleased with the reception accorded his humble offering. "I'd an idea you might like it, Gwen. You make me think of Golden-rod somehow, you know." That was all, but it left an unmistakable impression in the air that he meant a great deal more than was in those few words. Interior decorating was only one of a number of subjects which came in for a share of attention during the rest of that summer. They talked of everything?gardening, radio, fashions,
GOLDEN-ROD 589
tennis, poultry-raising, and politics; but the greatest of these was cooking?Gwen's cooking. "L. J." went into raptures over her chocolate cake, and transports over the lemon pies she concocted. "It's unbelievable that a girl like you can cook," he said once. "I have always divided girls into two classes?good-lookers, and good-cookers?and foolishly imagined that never the twain shall meet. But here we have the proven combination! Whew!" His obviously complimentary remarks always just missed being too personal, but there was an approving quality in his smile, a significance underlying his Gwenward glances that carried over the message of his growing interest; the fact that it did get over was attested by the tender, womanly sweetness which gradually came to take the place of the rollicking merriment Gwen had displayed toward Marcia?Marcia who needed so much love now that she was missing all of the glory life was pouring out upon the younger girl with such unstinted generosity. The summer had passed in a blaze of heat and happiness, and September was well along with its gift of heavenly coolness before Gwen could bring herself to speak of the new thing in her heart. Then one evening in the soft twilight she slipped down onto the floor beside Marcia's couch. "I can't fool myself any longer, Sis," she said simply. "I'm utterly and completely in love! And I believe he cares for me, too, though he hasn't told me so, formally. His houses aren't done yet, and I imagine he's waiting until he knows whether or not he's to be a member of the firm, before he declares himself. Do you think I'm mistaken about his caring, Marcia?" "No, Gwen, honey. You're right; I'm sure as if he had broadcasted it from L. J. W. It's dear of him to want to be quite sure of what he is asking you to share. And it will make me very happy to see you in the care of a man like him," Marcia replied with conviction. "Oh, Marcia!" and Gwen was on her knees with both arms tight around the other, and the fulness of her glad heart pouring out in her voice. But the very next day brought an end to her dreaming. She was glancing through the morning paper while waiting for the eggs to boil, and read that Mr. And Mrs. Alexander Sauls announced the engagement of their daughter, Jane, to Mr. Lawrence John Weldon, the marriage to take place in October, after Miss Saul's return from Europe. It was an ordinary enough bit of news to most people, but to one girl standing over the gas range, it was world-destroying. To her torture-numbered heart she advanced the feverish argument that it was her own fault, 'I should not have let my own feelings
590 THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE
interpret his friendship into something different! He has never said a word which a soon-to-be-married man might not properly say to any girl. He has been the soul of honor, and I've been nothing but a sentimental! Little simpleton, and it is up to me to forget the whole thing as soon as possible!' and she took that page of the paper and stuffed it into the waste-basket, that Marcia need not know. She would sympathize, and that would be the last straw. A decided pallor, and hard-boiled eggs were the only signs of anything amiss; the world-old excuse of a little headache, which will always cover a multitude of heart-aches, sufficed to quiet the question of Marcia's lips, and somehow the girl found herself at her old desk, with the world giving every indication of a firm intention to continue as usual. Gwen made a tremendous effort to be the same friendly, business-like secretary "L. J." had known, and succeeded surprisingly well, considering everything. He little dreamed how deadeningly life stretched out ahead of her that day. But the day was still holding earthquakes for Gwen. At home she found Marcia thrilled to the point of incoherence. Before she was well inside the room Marcia had hurled at her the bomb of her own felicitation. "Gwen, Doctor Foster and his wife have been here, and they are going to Vienna to study spinal diseases, and they are going to take me with them, for he thinks my back can be cured! Think, Gwennie, cured!" "Oh, Marcia, it's too wonderful to believe all at once! You'll come home to me all strong and well again? It's the answer to all our prayers, dear! It's the reason we could be brave in the face of everything you've had to bear." "But I won't go, Gwen, unless I know that everything is to be as we hope with you and 'L. J.' I couldn't leave you alone for three years, even to get my back made well," Marcia continued in a tone of finality, and Gwen knew without thinking it all out that their old game of "make-believe" would have to defend its right to existence now?tomorrow. "I love you, Marcia," she said. That night she did not sleep a wink; the morning after, she faced the hardest task of her life, for Marcia's sake. In answer to her almost inaudible tap on his door, "L. J.," in his cheery morning voice bade the tapper enter. She did, and walking straight up to him, plunged into the thick of it. "'L. J.', please don't interrupt me, or I'll never get up courage to go on. It's dreadful to ask the thing I'm going to ask of you, but it's to make Marcia go to Europe and have her back treated properly, so I must. You see she has a most mistaken idea that you and I care for each other in a serious way, and she won't
GOLDEN-ROD 591
leave me unless she's sure that I'll be taken care of?be left in good hands, you know?and she thinks they should be your hands. Of course, | know of your engagement, but Marcia doesn't, so would you mind pretending, just for a week that you'd like to marry me, so that Marcia can go in peace? As soon as she leaves, I'll jilt you?before the boat is out of sight?and not a soul will be harmed. Will you do it?could you?" The excitement had made of her eyes and cheeks a jumble of stars and roses. An inscrutable, masculine Mona Lisa smile came upon the face of "L. J." "Yes, I will, if you'll ask me to supper tonight, and have hot biscuits and honey!" "It's a bargain, then," and Gwen's cold little fist was closed for an instant in the man's big warm one. "At six-thirty, then," and neither one referred to the matter again all day. "L. J." was disconcertingly prompt. It was six-twenty-four when he sniffingly entered the door. "Biscuits ready?" he called boyishly. "I went without my lunch so I'd have an excuse to eat all I craved. They smell about right!" "Five more minutes," Gwen's voice from the kitchen sounded as light as the biscuits, but her heart was as heavy as the oven door. It was impossible to catch what was being said between Marcia and "L. J.", but Gwen feared the worst, and the sight of her sister's shining face confirmed her fears. "Fate is on our side, Gwennie, and I can't even wait to let "L. J." tell you about it himself. He wants you to marry him as soon as you can be ready?he asked if I thought you cared at all for him?imagine!" Gwen ran back into the kitchen to hide her scarlet face, and filled a pitcher with water to make them think it was water she went for. But there was already one pitcher on the table, so it really made her embarrassment more emphatic, and they all laughed. She wondered if she could possibly keep the tears back until "L. J." had gone, and if the ghastly hours would ever drag by. They did at length, and dropping into her bed she slept from sheer weariness. Then morning drifted into her consciousness like a shroud. At the office "L. J." very considerately avoided her until well along toward afternoon, when came a summons from his office. "There's a particular shade of yellow I'm thinking of putting in a house I'm doing, Gwen, and if you don't mind I'd like you to go with me and see what you think of it." Wordlessly she complied, and soon they were speeding in
592 THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE
his luxurious gray car along a road so full of happy memories that she could scarcely bear it today, in her misery. "Don't take me this way, please, 'L. J.'! It's Tompie's Trail, where the Golden-rod used to grow, and I'd rather go another way, if you don't mind. Unheeding, unanswering, he spun along to a point in the trail where Golden-rod flung its feathery beauty abroad in prodigal abundance. Stopping the car, the man climbed out, and gathered a great clump of it to thrust into Gwen's arms. Then he looked straight into her eyes. "Gwen, please don't interrupt me until I've finished, or I'll never get courage to go on! I just want you to know that I'm not engaged?that's my Uncle, Lawrence-John Weldon, and I'm not even named after him! And Jane Alexander is forty if she's a day. I've cared for you a lot, Gwen, but was so afraid that you regarded me as only a rather wearisome person who tried to inflict business on you after business hours, that I haven't scraped up the crust to ask you what you thought of me. Then last night, Marcia said that you had told her you 'did see a little something to like in me. Gwen, is it true? Do you honestly think you could care enough to marry me? Will you, dear? I love you.' There was blue mist in her eyes, and a rainbow in her smile. "Why, I don't even know your name, but whatever it is, I'll call you by it,' cause I'm so frightfully glad that it isn't Lawrence John." "It's Leander Joseph! Will you marry me, Gwen?tomorrow?" "Oh, Leander Joseph, I will, tomorrow, if you'll let me have Golden-rod for my bridal bouquet!"
Endurance
Third poem to receive honorable mention in the Eliza R. Snow. Memorial Contest.
By Josie E. Childs
I labored up a rugged steep, Endurance for my guide; My burden more than mine alone, But she kept by my side To urge me, when I fain would stop To rest, with words of cheer? To reach the summit of the hill That seemed to her so near.
ENDURANCE 593
Weary and footsore, on I went, Faltering as I stepped, The load upon my back so great, In agony I wept. Why should I struggle with this load? Was not my own enough? Why not turn back and try to find A path less steep and rough?
'Twas then Endurance kindly spoke, In words so soft and low, "Dear, you will find great obstacles Which ever way you go. It was intended from the first. Your pathway should be rough, Till God himself was satisfied And gently said, 'Enough.'
"The obstacles now in your path Will swiftly pass away, If dauntlessly you look ahead And watch as well as pray. Then keep right on, do not turn back No matter what the cost; You must be valiant to the end Or everything is lost,
"And what you do to aid mankind, And ease their load of care, Will bring to you great happiness? Their pleasures you shall share. The burden which you felt so great, Each step will lighter be And in the end bring rich reward Throughout eternity."
I thought, then, it is not so hard This rugged steep to climb, If through experience I obtain These blessings so sublime. I wished no longer to turn back, But, with undaunted will, I and Endurance safely reached The summit of the hill.

Which is better, squash or pumpkin for making pies?
Since colonial days the pumpkin pie has been a favorite and popular one, especially at this time of year. The best ones, however, are made of squash. It has a more delicate texture and sweeter flavor. It requires less sugar, and since it is not so watery as pumpkin, more milk need be used. There is a difference in squash, too. The dry, mealy or fluffy type when cooked is best.
Do not leave a metal spoon in the pan if you want the contents to boil quickly. The spoon is a good conductor of heat and much is carried off, hence the delay in cooking.
When plants have to be left a long time without water, try this method. Put as many bricks in a tub as there are plants to be watered. Pour enough water in the tub to barely cover the brick. Stand a flower pot on each brick. The latter being porous absorbs the moisture and sufficient water is carried to the plant to keep it fresh.
Before putting new oilcloth on the table, paste a square of heavy muslin on the inside of the cloth where the corners of the table come. This lengthens the wearing qualities.
If, when traveling, you are required to carry bottles of medicine or liquid of any kind, dip the tops in melted paraffine wax to avoid danger of leakage.
To shrink woolen yarn before it is knitted, or crocheted into scarfs, sweaters, etc., wrap it in a cloth and place in a steamer, or put into a hammock placed in the wash boiler, for several hours. Keep the water boiling. Shake out and dry in the wind. If put into too hot a sunshine the white wool is apt to turn brown and be streaked. This method is a good way to treat yarn that has been used once and raveled out. It can be used again and will be as fluffy as new yarn.
In homes where the year's supply of flour is purchased at one time, a convenient and sanitary way of storing it is to use a large galvanized iron, or any other strong mouse-proof metal bin. Place in the attic or any other convenient place so that a spout no smaller than eight inches in diameter coming from the center of the oval bottom of the bin, will connect with the kitchen in the most convenient place for obtaining the flour. It is best in an enclosed side-cupboard with space allowed under the spout to admit a container for receiving the flour. Care must be taken that the receiving door, seams, and the stop in spout, are substantial and close-fitting ? Mrs. C. N. H., Malta, Idaho.

When the field corn has ripened, is the time to make hominy. To make lye hominy dissolve one teaspoon red seal lye in one quart of boiling water. Put this in an enamel kettle, add the corn from two large ears, cook for thirty minutes or until the hulls will slip off easily when pressed between the fingers. When all the hulls are loosened, take from the stove, add cold water and stir. Pour off the water, repeat several times, then take a wire potato-masher and churn it, adding and pouring off water frequently until the corn is clean. Cover with water, heat to boiling point and drain. Repeat several times until you are sure all the lye is washed off. Add more water and cook until tender, add salt when the corn is nearly done. Then bottle and seal. It may be cooked in a pressure cooker, which will insure it keeping perfectly. Mrs. A. H., Blanding, Utah.
To prepare mustard which resembles the commercial product use the following: 1 tbsp. Flour. 3 tbsp. Mustard. 1 tbsp. Sugar 1 tsp. Turmeric. Mix these ingredients and add one egg, beat until smooth, mix thoroughly with 1 cup of vinegar diluted with water and sugar to suit taste. Boil until thick stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Pour into glass jars while hot and seal. It keeps indefinitely ?Mrs. O. H., Spanish Fork, Utah.
Very attractive and economical holders for ironed doilies and centerpieces can be made by using cartons or any stiff. Cardboard. Cut in pieces the size and shape of the doilies, then with library paste, paste white paper or cloth on the inside and figured or plain colored paper or cretonne on the outside. Punch holes on each side and tie two together with ribbon. These will lay perfectly flat in a drawer and will keep the doilies from being wrinkled or soiled?Mrs. E. B. S., St. Thomas, Nevada.
A few drops of iodine applied to a bee or insect sting will give almost instant relief and will prevent the affected part from swelling if used at once. Do not bind after application. Mrs. L. A., Logan, Utah.
I have found this preparation for cleaning wall paper to be equally as good as the commercial product and is much cheaper. Use one quart of flour and one tablespoon of alum. Mix together in cold water until a little thicker than pancake batter. Cook it, stirring all the time, until it becomes

so thick that you can not stir it any more, then mix in either of the following you may have: cornmeal, germ-made or bran, until the dough does not stick to your fingers. Rub the paper lightly with this and it will look fresh and new. This will not remove fly specks. Some of the market preparations will not do this either?Mrs. E. S. J., Mapleton, Utah.
The springs of an old window shade make good substitute springs for a screen door. They may also be used for the baby's swing and the bird's cage. The rollers of the discarded shade may be covered and used for rolling large centerpieces and doilies to keep them from being soiled.? Mrs. O. J. H., Ogden, Utah.
When children are going to school there are sometimes many stains of ink on their clothing. I find this very helpful in removing them. Just place the part that is stained in a small vessel of boiling water to which has been added a heaping teaspoon of common baking soda and let stand until water is quite cool. If ink is not all removed repeat the same treatment and then wash in usual way.? Mrs. P. N. P., Winter Quarters, Utah.
When the first cold or stormy weather comes is the time to prevent colds, especially with children. In nine cases out of ten a cold can be prevented by gargling the throat and spraying the nostrils with a solution of boric acid. I tried this simple remedy in my home last winter and the entire family were practically free from colds. If there is no nasal spray in the home snuffing the solution up the nose thoroughly is just as effective. Salt water, though not quite so good, may be used in place of the boric acid.? Mrs. G. W. Al., Logan, Utah.

Keep a Health Budget
James H. Wallis, Executive Secretary Utah Public Health Association.
There is no question but that the Federal budget works. We see and hear favorable comments about its efficiency published or spoken nearly every day. There is no question but that a health budget works, also. In keeping the health budget a man or woman is putting by a nest egg for the rainy day without which any money budget, however carefully followed, will be useless. For what does it matter if, after years of careful planning to live economically and successfully, a person's health fails? All the riches of Croesus in the later years of life are of no use unless one has health to enjoy their benefits. For after all, health is at the basis of all enjoyment of life. As you portion out your yearly income, devoting so much money to housing, so much to food?to clothing?to charity, to amusement, so should you portion out your health budget. A happy comfortable home for oneself (and, if fortunate, for one's family) is the goal toward which everyone primarily is working. And to keep this home comfortable and in excellent condition, repairs and improvements are constantly demanding their share of the money budget. "In planning the health budget you will center everything about the body home?after all, everyone's real home. First you must know just what sort of a home your body is. Can it give the proper amount of service? Can it compete with other homes about it? Or do its boards squeak, its windows rattle, does its roof leak or are its ceilings cracked and its attic untidy with the accumulation of years of neglect? The best way to find out its condition is to have a thorough overhauling of your body by a good physician. If he finds any boards that are rickety, such as a weak heart, a poor liver, deranged kidneys, bad tonsils, or teeth, or eyes, you can take care of them before real trouble occurs. Then as you allow so much of the money budget for lighting, heat and fuel so must you put thought (for the health budget requires thought rather than money) into planning the fuel for the body. Food is the fuel that keeps it running. Eat the right foods as conscientiously as you buy the best wood or coal. Plenty of leafy vegetables; more meat, if you are doing hard, physical labor, than if you have work that keeps you confined to a desk; fruit to keep the digestive apparatus functioning properly; milk; bran or wholewheat breads; well-cooked cereals and enough sweets to add variety but not too much, to make you flabby. Fresh air is a big part of the health budget. That is 598 THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE indirectly associated with practically every other item. Fresh air day and night helps to keep every part of the body working well. It is a cleanser, a purifier, and without it one's home would. Become as dusty and musty as the old-time unopened "guest chamber." Not only the lungs need the fresh air but every part of the body responds to this tonic and will give better service. Fresh air is a sickness preventive and is cheaper than any other medicine. Especially at night in the bedrooms should windows be opened wide to allow the outdoor air ito do its work. Rest is also most essential. Just as we know we must oil our lawn mowers, put grease in our motor's oilcups, so must we keep lubricating our systems. Everybody needs rest to keep his body engine running. Edison, who claims he can live on but a few hours' sleep at night, often rests on a couch at intervals during the day. When there has been a strain, either mental or physical, the body needs more rest. Try going to bed earlier when the day's toil has seemed particularly trying. Mothers, go to bed earlier when the children or housework have given you a difficult day. The next day's efficiency will be doubled. Exercise should be in the health budget. Exercise keeps every muscle in good working order, and, if only a mile walk a day is possible, that is better than nothing. "The more exercise in the sunshine and fresh air the better will be the physical service rendered in later years. Play is also necessary, for this is stimulating when taken at the proper time and is of the right kind. Play, moreover, is mental relaxation. Anything that is of mental benefit is pretty sure to be of physical help, too, for a happy, contented mind can often buoy up a tired out body. These are a few of the main items in the health budget. They will practically guarantee happiness for later years and for that reason, if for no other, they are closely linked with the money budget. As one works toward a goal in money so can one work toward a goal in health. Prevention is far better than cure, just as a nest egg is better than poverty. The National Tuberculosis Association, and its affiliated organization, the Utah Public Health Association, believe that prevention of tuberculosis through the education of men, women and children has been a great cause for more than cutting in half the death rate from this disease during the past twenty years. Their work is financed by the annual sale of tuberculosis Christmas seals. They have no other revenue. You can help them in December by buying Christmas seals. You can help them all through the year by keeping a Health Budget. When you buy seals, be sure they are the tuberculosis seal. The amount Utah has been called on to raise is $45,000. Dr. John A. Widtsoe has again very generously consented to take charge of the Christmas Seal Sale this year. Notes from the Field Amy Brown Lyman Swiss and German Mission. The following cordial letter of appreciation and greeting was recently received. By President Clarissa S. Williams from Mrs. Eliza W. Tadje, president of the Relief Societies of the Swiss-German mission: "I wish herewith, in the name of the members of the Relief Societies of the Swiss and German mission, to express our gratitude for the friendly greetings from you conveyed to us by Miss Alice L. Reynolds, during her visit to our mission. It was indeed a great joy to us, dear Sister Williams, to know that you think of your far-away sisters; and we wish to assure you that we are striving as best we can to contribute to the success of our great organization, the direction of which rests in your worthy hands. "It is a great pleasure for us to be able to tell you that the women of this mission recognize your blessed endeavors, as General President of the Church Relief Societies, and we trust that your health shall permit you to stand at the head of this organization for many years to come. "We send you simultaneously, with sincerest wishes that your endeavors may continue to be crowned with success, the most devoted greetings of all the women of this mission as your faithful co-laborers in the work of the Lord.

Granite Stake. The Granite stake Relief Society held an elaborate and most successful carnival in each of the nine wards of the stake, simultaneously, on the fifth Tuesday in September, at the regular meeting hour. The special object of the carnival was: to honor the mothers of the stake; to pay a tribute to motherhood: to create an interest among the young mothers in the Relief Society lesson work which is designed to be especially helpful to young mothers in rearing their children, to stimulate interest generally throughout the stake, and to start out the year's work with enthusiasm. 600 THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE All mothers of each ward were invited to participate, in full, in the carnival, regardless of creed, their names and addresses being furnished by the visiting teachers. An excellent outlined program with copy of short drama, and suggestions, was sent to the wards several weeks before time for the carnival, in order that there might be adequate preparation. The program and some of the suggestions follow: MOTHER'S CARNIVAL (To be held in each ward in Granite Stake, September 29, 1925) (Suggestive Program) 2:00 p. M.?Formal reception with ward presidency and visiting General and Stake officers in receiving line. Soft lullaby music. 2:30 p. M.?Congregational Hymn, "Count Your Blessings." Prayer. Lullaby Music Short Drama, "Cornelia." Lullaby Music. Story by ward Literary Class Leader. Music or Dance Number. Few remarks on glory of Motherhood and why it should be honored; and announcement of the year's program of Relief Society Work, by Ward Relief Society President. Presentation of special gifts or prizes by M. I. A. Girls if possible to:. (a) Youngest Mother present. (b) Oldest Mother present. (c) Mother of most sons. (d) Mother of most daughters. - (e) Mothers of twins. (f{) Mothers of triplets. (g) Stake prize for longest membership in Relief Society of any mother present; second, and third prizes for those who have belonged next longest times. Presentation of gifts to all other mothers present. Grand March of the Mothers in two's, led by those who have borne the most children, followed by those who have borne the next number, and so on.; Light refreshments served, cafeteria style. Doxology. Benediction. MOTHER'S CARNIVAL (September 29, 1925) Suggestions and Notes Have nothing morbid or sad in the program. Feature lullaby music and cradle songs. Use M. I. A. Girls as helpers wherever possible. Send a gift to all mothers who are detained at home through sickness. 5 During carnival, ward recreation committee might hold a little NOTES FROM THE FIELD 601 children's party in another part of the building. The stake recreation leader will provide outline for this party. 6. Those who have taken children to rear, though they have not been so blessed as to have children of their own, are honored according to the number they have taken, just as if they had borne them. 7. Gifts. Have a gift for every mother in the ward, such as: decorated candles, neck-wear, handkerchiefs, aprons, garters, perfumes, talcum, nail files, powder puffs, doilies, towels, useful bags, caps, mats, pictures, scarfs, books, music, beads, candy, etc. 8. Secure the gifts by having some of the articles made during August and September from scraps, under the direction of some capable person; by collecting contributions for purchasing gifts, from members of the Priesthood quorums and all others who will contribute; by having the young ladies of the ward make candy for gifts. 9. The day before carnival, all gifts should be wrapped and numbered. There should be enough gifts for every mother in the ward to have one. Keep the prizes separate from the gifts. Officers can determine before hand how many of these will be needed. 10. All Relief Society officers and visiting teachers should be at Relief Society Hall at 1:45 p. M. Teachers should receive all guests at the door, welcoming those from their own district and seeing that the necessary information is recorded in card index. A number should be pinned on each mother by her visiting teacher. This number should not be lost as it entitles her to the gift marked with the same number. 11. The stake will provide each ward, with cards for card index to assist in determining the prize winners. The stake will send copies of the short drama to all wards; the stake literary leader will assist in selecting and preparing a suitable story, if desired; the stake music department will provide list of suitable musical numbers from which selections may be made. Gunnison Stake. On September 4, the Gunnison stake Relief Society gave a social in honor of all local officers and teachers. An appropriate program was followed by dancing and refreshments, and a very sociable time was enjoyed by about two hundred and fifty people. Prizes were awarded to wards excelling in the following activities, during the first six months of the year: highest percent of attendance; greatest number of days spent in the temple; highest percent of teachers' visits; highest percent of Relief Society members taking Relief Society Magazine; teacher longest in service, and oldest acting teacher at the present time. Wards highest in the above first three activities received two Relief Society song books each, and the three latter received one year's subscription to the Relief Society Magazine. It was found that Mrs. Hannah M. Christensen from the Mayfield ward has been a teacher for the past forty-nine years and: is still active; that Mrs. Elizabeth Anderson from the same ward has acted forty-seven years; and that the oldest acting teacher in the stake is Mgrs. Sena Larson who is seventy-eight years of age, and never fails to visit her district each month. 602 THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE Teton Stake. On Friday, August 7, the officers of the Driggs ward Relief Society entertained in honor of the following elderly women of their ward: Ann Mary Hyde, Emily Fairbanks, Francis A. Hopkins, Sarah A. Price, Mary A. Griggs, Margaret E. Crandall, Francis Huff, and Emma McDaniels. The honored guests were taken for a car ride, after which a delicious luncheon was served in the stake office. The tables were beautifully decorated with flowers, large bouquets being used as centerpieces and smaller ones as favors. The time was spent in pleasant social chat and humorous stories, and toasts to the honored guests. Morgan Stake. On September 1, at Como Springs, the Morgan stake Relief Society gave a social in honor of the officers and members of the Relief Society, with their husbands. The stake recreation committee had charge of the program and games and assisted greatly in making the affair a success. The stake board served refreshments to 150 people. Northwestern States Mission. The Relief Society pageant, "The Guardianship of Life," was recently put on in Hall, Montana, to a large and appreciative audience. The Methodist minister, of Drummond, wrote the Society a very complimentary letter regarding the performance. An invitation was received later to take the pageant to Philipsburg (thirty miles distant) and put it on in one of their churches there. The invitation was accepted, but the opera house was used instead of the church because of stake facilities. Alpine Stake. The Alpine stake health center committee held eight conferences or clinics during the month of August and early part of September. Five of these conferences include several wards. The names of those with defects and the nature of defects was left with each ward Relief Society president. Realizing that the presidents understand conditions in their wards, they have been appointed assistants to the health center committee that follow-up work may be better looked after. The health committee with their social service fund assists very materially in the follow-up work. Great satisfaction is felt in all the communities with the results. Mindoka Stake. Early in July the Minidoka stake Relief Society. Wrote the State Health Department of Idaho requesting them to arrange a date for a clinic to be held in the stake. The request was readily granted and arrangements were made for a health conference to NOTES ROM THE IIELD 603 be held on one day at Heyburn (August 29), and one day at Minidoka (August 31). The idea of holding the clinics at the two places was to accommodate more people and lessen the distance people would have to travel. President May Jones, in company with the field nurse, made the preliminary arrangements and on the days appointed, Mrs. Jones, together with her counselors, Zella Smith and Matilda Sanford, did all the weighing and measuring of the children. There were four pairs of twins examined at the Heyburn conference and a total of 107 mothers and children examined during the two days. Only three children among those examined were found to be in normal health condition. Follow-up work will be done in the near future with the return of the field nurse, who will be assisted in the work by the stake Relief Society presidency. Tooele Stake. Several of the wards of Tooele stake have conducted health clinics during the summer, and, while the follow-up work has not been so thorough as desired by the stake, a fine beginning has been made and there is hope that the future will see great improvement along this line. REORGANIZATIONS Benson Stake. At the quarterly conference of the Benson stake, held in Richmond, July 18-19, president Lucy M. Funk with her counselors and board members were honorably released. Mrs. Funk has served faithfully and well during her term of office and she and her associates will long be remembered for the excellent work they have accomplished. At the same meeting the following officers were sustained to take the places of those released: Mrs. Effie A. Greene, president; Mrs. Hilda Roskelley and Mrs. Mable Pond, counselors; Mirs. Mary B. Timmins, secretary, all of whom bring to the Society a valuable fund of knowledge gained from experience in various phases of church work. On Wednesday evening, August 5, 1925, the new officers tendered a testimonial social to those retiring. An interesting program was rendered, after which games and dancing were enjoyed under the direction of the stake recreation committee. This was followed by a delightful luncheon served cafeteria style. Mrs. Mable Pond, counselor to the new president, paid a splendid tribute to the retiring officers, some of whom had served for ten years, presenting each with a book, beautifully inscribed, as a lasting token of appreciation for their untiring and faithful service. Mrs. Funk in a response said that each of those retiring had been deeply touched by the token of respect and declared that the joy of service had amply repaid all for the time and effort expended. 604 THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE Moapa Stake. The Moapa stake was reorganized August 30, 1925, at the quarterly conference. Mrs. Lois E. Jones was appointed president to succeed Mrs. Ellen Gentry, who passed away in May, 1925. The following other officers were appointed to serve with Mrs. Jones: Mrs. Viola Earl and Mrs. Lois Wells, counselors; Mrs. Ellen Perkins, secretary-treasurer. Eastern States Mission. On September 13, 1925, Miss Pearl Snow was honorably released as president of the Relief Societies of the Eastern States mission. Miss Snow was an efficient and faithful officer, and gave very valuable service in the interest of the Relief Society during her term of office, but as the time had come for her release from the mission field, a reorganization was necessary. ' Miss Luella B. Owen was appointed president to succeed Miss Snow. "The world stands out on either side No wider than the heart is wide; Above the world is stretched the sky No higher than the soul is high. The heart can push the sea and land Farther away on either hand; The soul can split the sky in two And let the face of God shine thorough. But East and West will pinch the heart That cannot keep them pushed apart; And he whose soul is flat?the sky - Will cave in on him by and by." Guide Lessons for January LESSON J Theology and Testimony THE MOSAIC Dispensation (Continued), Editors' note: You will observe that the lessons for 1926 are in the main a continuation of those of 1925. In other words, the Theology Lessons will be taken from the Old Testament, the Literature Lessons will be American authors, chiefly of recent date. The Social Service Lesson will be Child Welfare, emphasizing mental hygiene of childhood. PART II. WOMEN OF THE DISPENSATION 1. Miriam. (a) Biography. Her parents were of the tribe of Levi, chosen to officiate in spiritual matters, and after whom the Lesser Priesthood was named. She was born about three hundred and forty years after the Israelites, consisting of seventy souls, came to Egypt. A girl not more than eight years of age she acted the part of a sentinel of salvation on the banks of the river Nile. She married a valiant Israelite named Hur, of the tribe of Judah, who, with Aaron, held up the hands of Moses until Israel prevailed. (Ex. 17:11-12.) That she was a mother in Israel is evident from Ex. 31:2. At the age of eighty-seven, she led the women of Israel in triumphal dance and song, replying to the men who sang the first song of record. See Ex. 15:1-21. In the wilderness she made one mistake. See Numbers 12. She died during the latter part of the journey in the wilderness, being about one hundred and twenty-five years of age. (b) Characterization. In the light of her long and strenuously active life, Miriam must have been a woman of unusual physical make-up. Intellectually she was a born leader. Note the adroitness of her question to the Egyptian princess at the bathing place. The fact of her taking a stand against Moses, in her one mistake, is indicative of a consciousness of mental ability. In her error, her strength was her weakness. It was a case of excessive ethical zeal blinding the eyes to spiritual judgment. She failed to hear the whispering of the spirit which always says, when the tongue would wag against the Lord's Anointed, keep still and wait upon the wisdom of the Lord, who has better ethical eyesight, clearer judgment, than any individual, and more authority than all Israel for dealing with his chosen ones. In all such cases the attempts at correction by humanity is a reflection on Divinity. Spiritually, this wonderful women meritoriously gained 606 THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE the title of Prophetess. See Ex. 15:20. The work she did received the approval of the Lord to the extent that one of the Prophets of Israel places her as one of the deliverers of Israel. See Micah 6:3, 4. 2. Deborah. For twenty years Israel had borne the oppression of Jabin, the king of Canaan, as a penalty for their turning away from the Lord. With broken spirits they cried unto the Lord for deliverance, but it appears that the men of Israel had dwindled in the qualities of leadership. Patriotism and faith in God was preserved in the character of Deborah. The people trusted her, and God inspired her. She was a "Prophetess," and as such directed the campaign that resulted in the deliverance of Israel. See Judges 4. The event is illustrative of the fact, that when men cannot, or refuse to, lead where leadership is needed, the Lord may make leaders of women.: 3. Jephthah's Daughter. The historical event that brought this woman into prominence has in it the lesson that the Lord is not pleased with pledges that involve the agency of man. The manner in which the maiden accepted the result of her father's vow, points not only to most filial love, but a sublime reverence for spiritual obligations. The granted request for a period of retirement to mourn, not the giving up of life, but the opportunity for perpetuating life is indicative of what the greatest desire of a high grade Israelite maiden was. See Judges 11:30-40. As to the fulfilling of the vow, we are left to conjecture, but there is a glimmer of light in verse thirty-nine that gives hope, at least, that the Egyptian custom of human sacrifice, which the Lord condemned, did not prevail. 4. Ruth. She exemplifies loyalty. The first two elements of loyalty are expressed in Ruth's reply to Naomi. See Ruth 1:16, 17. The third element of loyalty is found in the care with which Ruth carried out the counsel of Naomi. See Ruth 3. 5. Huldah. Living in the college in Jerusalem, she was a prophetess and theological scholar, and she gave the word of the Lord to the King of Judah. See II Kings 22. 6. Vashti. Though not an Israelite, she played a noble part in the history of Israel. Her conduct exemplifies the consistency of limiting the demands of obedience to a husband, to the realm of righteousness. She chose to be a queenly woman without a crown, in / GUIDE LESSONS FOR JANUARY 607 preference to being an unwomanly queen wearing a crown. See Esther 1. 7. Esther. An orphan early in life. Reared in Babylonian captivity, by her father's nephew. Chosen queen 'because of her beauty. Obedient still to her foster father. Saves the king from two traitors. Plans a fast for her people. Risks her life to save her people. Wins out against the arch enemy of the Jews. Exercises royal power to free the Jews. She was an ideal Israelite, an ideal woman. A woman of physical perfection, whose intelligence could be depended upon, whose faith would not weaken, and whose fidelity would never fail. See Esther 2:8, 9. The leadership of women in the Mosaic Dispensation, as in all previous dispensations, did not include ordination to the Priesthood. Yet, it was recognized by the Lord in the sending of Miriam to assist in the deliverance of Israel; in the fulfilling of the prophecies of the patriotic prophetess Deborah, and in the honoring of the declarations made in His name by the scholarly prophetess, Huldah. While the Lord blessed woman's leadership with merit behind it, He did the opposite with that based on meddlesomeness. Questions and Problems 1. Name at least four women of the Mosaic Dispensation other than those mentioned in this lesson. 2. What is your mental picture of Miriam as the Sentinel on the Nile? See Ex. 2:4. 3. Quote the women's chorus reply to the singing of the men at the Red Sea. 4. Describe Miriam as you see her at the Red Sea Celebration. 5. In what way is the mistake of Miriam being sometimes repeated in modern Israel? 6. Quote Micah 6:4 as evidence that Miriam was called of God to her mission. 7. Show that women are called in this dispensation and sent of God as was Miriam. 8. What are the proofs that Deborah was inspired by the Lord as Judge of Israel. 9. Relate Huldah's declaration, 2 Kings 22:15-20, and tell what the effects of the declaration were. See 2 Kings 23:1-17. 10. Where did Esther place her life on the altar for the salvation of her people? 11. Esther requested a general fast by the people. What does this request say concerning her home training and the customs of the Jews in the home? 608 THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE LESSON II "Work and Business (Second Week in January) TEACHER'S TOPIC FOR JANUARY, 1926 THE NEW YEAR RING OUT WILD BELLS Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky, The flying cloud the frosty light: The year is dying in the night; Ring out, wild bells, and let him die. Ring out the old, ring in the new, Ring, happy bells, across the snow; The year is going, let him go; Ring out the false, ring in the true. ?Tennyson. 1. The New Year is a time to look backward and count blessings rather than to think of misfortunes. 2. A time to cast off old worries and grudges. To rid the mind and the heart of all ill will. 3. A time to welcome new duties and responsibilities. 4. A time to examine ourselves to see if our mental attitude is such that we radiate joy. "Man is that he might have joy.'?Book of Mormon. "The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, or a hell of heaven."  5. A time to call with bounteous good wishes on those who need spiritual refreshment. LESSON III Literature (Third Week in January) CANADIAN POETS Our last lesson was devoted to the three American poets of the United States who served in the Great World War. We shall devote this lesson to two Canadian poets who stand out conspicuously among war poets, for not even the name of Rupert Brooke which is hallowed by all who know the history of our war poetry, is held in such sacred memory as that. Of John D. McGrae, the Canadian poet, who wrote In Flanders'  2 GUIDE LESSONS FOR JANUARY 609 field, and close to him in recognition is Robert W. Service with his thymes of a Red Cross Man. John David McCrae, like Oliver Wendell Holmes and S. Weir Mitchell was a physician. Physicians have so often turned to writing verse that it is impossible to regard the matter as a mere coincident. This Canadian physician who was both soldier and poet, was born in Guelph, Ontario, November 30, 1872. He was the second son of Lieutenant Colonel David McCrae, who took over a battery to France. He was educated at the University of Toronto, being graduated with the M. D. Degree in 1910. He was given a chair in the University of McGill, where he lectured on Pathology and Medicine. He was appointed assistant physician to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal and physician to the Alexandra Hospital. He collaborated with Professor Adams in writing a text book on Pathology and also contributed to the system of medicine by Ostler and McCrae, the latter being his elder brother. He served in the field during the second battle of Ypres where he was placed in charge of medicine and made second commander for the hospital unit provided by the McGill University. He was with the guns along the Ypres sector for 14 months and here he found the inspiration for many of his poems. His health broke under the strain of constant duty. In January, 1918, he contracted pneumonia which, complicated by meningitis, resulted in his death on January 28. Any one acquainted with the landscape of continental Europe knows that it is pretty well covered with green grass and liberally sprinkled with red poppies. 'Those who have seen the cemeteries of the late war, know that they are large plots of ground covered with green grass and white crosses that mark the graves of the men who fell in Flanders' fields and in France where the war was waged. IN FLANDERS' FIELDS N In Flanders' fields, the poppies blow Between the crosses, row on row, That mark our place; and in the sky The larks, still bravely singing, fly, Scarce heard amid the guns below. We are the dead. Short days ago We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow, Loved and were loved; and now we lie In Flanders' fields. 610 THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE Take up our quarrel with the foe! To you, from failing hands, we throw The torch. Be yours to lift it high! If ye break faith with us who die We shall not sleep, though poppies blow In Flanders' fields. This is a very unusual poem. It is realistic in its descriptive parts and idealistic in its spirit. The first stanza gives the setting in colorful words. The second stanza assumes that those who lie beneath the poppies and the grass after having made the supreme sacrifice, are speaking for themselves. The language of this stanza carries with it a very deep and touching human message, conveyed in language rarely matched in exquisiteness and effectiveness. The third stanza is a command to us to go on with the fight, followed by that most dramatic and soul stirring assertion: If ye break faith with us who die We shall not sleep, though poppies blow In Flanders' fields. ROBERT W. SERVICE Robert W. Service, born in the quiet little town of Preston, England, on January 16, 1874, emigrated to Vancouver, Canada, where the lure of an explorer's life took hold of him. He traveled up and down the Pacific coast experiencing many hardships, but collecting material which afterward crept into the lines of many of his poems. Before leaving England, he had served an apprenticeship with the Commercial Bank of Scotland, in the city of Glasgow, and now tired of the sacrifices incident to roaming up. And down, in rather wild country, he joined the staff of the Canadian Bank in Victoria, B. C. In 1905. He was transferred to White House, Yukon 'Territory and then to Dawson. Eight years in the Yukon resulted in transforming the bank employee into one of the most important poets of our time. If he collected some material for verse when he was floundering about on the Pacific coast, he collected infinitely more in the eight years in the Yukon. 1 The War made a deep impression on Robert W. Service as it did on a score of poets who read and speak the English language in many lands. He has collected his war poetry under the title of Rhymes of a Red Cross Man. His introductory poem which is entitled Foreword tells his story; for that reason we include it: FOREWORD I've tinkered at my bits of rhymes In weary, woeful, waiting times; GUIDE LESSONS FOR JANUARY 611 In doleful hours of battle-din, Ere yet they brought the wounded in; Through vigils of the fateful night, In lousy barns by candle-light; In dug-outs, sagging and aflood, On stretchers stiff and bleared with blood; By ragged grove, by ruined road, By hearths accrust where Love abode; By broken altars, blackened shrines I've tinkered at my bits of rhymes. [ve solaced me with scraps of song The desolate ways along: Through sickly fields all shrapnel-sown, And meadows reaped by death alone; By blazing cross and splintered spire, By headless Virgin in the mire: By gardens gashed amid their bloom, By gutted grave, by shattered tomb; Beside the dying and the dead, Where rocket green and rocket red, In trembling pools of poising light, With flowers of flame festoon the night, Ah me! By what dark ways of wrong I've cheered my heart with scraps of song. So here's my sheaf of war-won verse, And some is bad, and some is worse. And if at times I curse a bit, You needn't read that part of it; For through it all like horror runs The red resentment of the guns, And you yourself would mutter when You took the things that once were men, And sped them through that zone of hate To where the dripping surgeons wait; And wonder too if in God's sight War ever, ever can be right. Yet may it not be, crime and war But effort misdirected are, And if there's good in war and crime, There may be in my bits of rhyme, My songs from out the slaughter mill: So take or leave them as you will. YOUNG FELLOW MY LAD "Where are you going, Young Fellow My Lad, On this glittering morn of May?" 612 THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE "I'm going to join the Colors, Dad; They're looking for men, they say." "But you're only a boy, Young Fellow My Lad; You aren't obliged to go." "I'm seventeen and a quarter, Dad, And ever so strong, you know." "So you're off to France, Young Fellow My Lad, And you're looking so fit and bright." "I'm terribly sorry to leave you, Dad, But I feel that I'm doing right." "God bless you and keep you, Young Fellow My Lad, You're all of my life, you know." "Don't worry. I'll soon be back, dear Dad, And I'm awfully proud to go." "Why don't you write, Young Fellow My Lad? I watch for the post each day; And I miss you so, and I'm awfully sad, And it's months since you went away. And I've had the fire in the parlor lit, And I'm keeping it burning bright Till my boy comes home; and here I sit Into the quiet night." "What is the matter, Young Fellow My Lad? No letter again today. Why did the postman look so sad, And sigh as he turned away? I hear them tell that we've gained new ground, But a terrible price we've paid: God grant, my boy, that you're safe and sound; But oh I'm afraid, afraid." "They've told me the truth, Young Fellow My Lad: You'll never come-back again: (Oh God! The dreams and the dreams I've had, And the hopes I've nursed in vain!) For you passed in the night, Young Fellow My Lad, And you proved in the cruel test Of the screaming shell and the battle hell That my boy was one of the best. "So you'll live, you'll live, Young Fellow My Lad, In the gleam of the evening star, In the wood-note wild and the laugh of the child, In all sweet things that are.; And you'll never die, my wonderful boy, While life is noble and true; For all our beauty and hope and joy We will owe to our lads like you." GUIDE LESSONS FOR JANUARY 613 THE CONVALESCENT * * * So I walked among the willows very quietly all night; There was no moon at all, at all; no timid star alight; There was no light at all, at all; I wint from tree to tree, And I called him as his mother called, but he niver answered me. Oh I called him all the night-time, as I walked the wood alone; And I listened and I listened, but I nivver heard a moan; Then I found him at the dawnin', when the sorry sky was red: I was looking' for the livin', but I only found the dead. Sure I know that it was shamus by the silver cross he wore; But the bugles they were callin', and I heard the cannon roar. Oh I had no time to tarry, so IJ said a little prayer, And I clasped his hands together, and I left him lyin' there. Now the birds are singin', singin', and I'm home in Donegal, And it's Springtime, and I'm thinkin' that I only dreamed it all; I dreamed about that evil wood, all crowded with its dead, Where I knelt beside me brother when the battle-dawn was red. Where I prayed beside me brother ere I wint to fight anew: Such dreams as these are evil dreams; I can't believe it's true. Where all is love and laughter, sure it's hard to think of loss  But Mother's sayin' nothin' and she clasps?a silver cross. CARRY ON It's easy to fight when everything's right, And you're mad with the thrill and the glory; It's easy to cheer when victory's near, And wallow in fields that are gory. It's a different song when everything's wrong, When you're feeling infernally mortal; When it's ten against one, and hope there is none, Buck up, little soldier, and chortle: Carry on! Carry on! There isn't much punch in your blow. You're glaring and staring and hitting out blind; You're muddy and bloody, but never you mind. Carry on! Carry on! You haven't the ghost of a show. It's looking like death, but while you've a breath, Carry on, my son! Carry on! 614 THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE And so in the strife of the battle of life It's easy to fight when you're winning; It's easy to slave, and starve and be brave, When the dawn of success is beginning. But the man who can meet despair and defeat With a cheer, there's the man of God's choosing; The man who can fight to Heaven's own height Is the man who can fight when he's losing. Carry on! Carry on! Things never were looming so black. But show that you haven't a cowardly streak, And though you're unlucky you never are weak. Carry on! Carry on! Brace up for another attack. It's looking like hell, but?you never can tell: Carry on, old man! Carry on! There are some who drift out in the deserts of doubt, And some who in bruitishness wallow; There are others, I know, who in piety go Because of a Heaven to follow. But to labor with zest, and to give of your best, For the sweetness and joy of the giving; To help folks along with a hand and a song; Why, there's the real sunshine of living. Carry on! Carry on! Fight the good fight and true; Believe in your mission, greet life with a cheer; There's big work to do, and that's why you are here. Carry on! Carry on! Let the world be the better for you; And at last when you die, let this be your cry: Carry on, my soul! Carry on! " QUESTIONS AND PROBLEM 1.

LESSON IV Social Service (Fourth Week in January) CHILD WELFARE The subject of study in this department for the coming year will be the child. The emphasis of all betterment programs, whether in the field of health, education, behavior or economics, is being placed more and more on the child and his development. It is almost a maxim that society's best investment is in the next generation. It will, therefore, be the purpose of this and subsequent lessons to consider the problems of child development, and to attempt to gain some comprehension of the influences that contribute to a child's developing personality. The whole movement of present-day child study has been stimulated by the introduction, in the last two decades, ofa new dynamic psychology. The movement has resulted in a growing concern about the child's emotional and mental life, and in an increasing attempt to apply methods of treatment to early manifestations of instability, nervousness, and other abnormal behavior. This attempt to study the child has been termed the mental hygiene movement, and has been fostered by psychiatrists?who are physicians who have specialized in mental health. The alarming and increasing number of individuals who have nervous breakdowns, who are social failures because they are "queer," and who become delinquent and have criminal careers, have forced the attention of physicians, sociologists, and others interested in behavior. With adults, the disintegrating forces have usually played much havoc and mental and emotional rehabilitation is frequently a difficult and often a hopeless task. But it is the hope of the medical practitioner and the social worker that early discovery of symptoms and the early treatment of. Abnormalities will save many of the next generation from failure, disappointment, unhappiness, and deterioration. The psychiatrist deals with the entire make-up of the individual. The physical, mental, emotional, and social problems are so closely related that it is only when all the forces 616 THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE and influences that act on an individual are understood, that the underlying difficulty can be discovered and treated. Children in almost every home present some type of behavior? difficulty in such common forms as fighting, nail-biting, day-~ dreaming, refusing to take food, bed-wetting, having night terrors, lying, etc. These manifestations cannot be treated by a set formula, but often an insight into the whole mental, physical, social and emotional life of the child reveals a simple cause that can be easily treated. The term that the mental expert uses to describe the entire individual is "personality." In the text that will be used as a reference, a number of personality studies are given, and it is hoped that by analyzing this material, that some insight will be gained into the many factors that affect child behavior and development. The term "personality" as defined by psychiatrists is the individual's total equipment. Personality is the sum of any person's physical, mental, and emotional make-up. The term personality, unless modified or explained can give no picture of the individual. We can conceive, however, of a feebleminded personality, an intelligent personality, an adequate personality, and even an inadequate personality. An inadequate personality might be an individual who cannot make the necessary adjustments to life; he perhaps fails as a student in school or has some difficulty with his school work; he perhaps has some trouble in the neighborhood and probably is a disciplinary problem at home. As he matures, his difficulty with his environment is likely to increase and when he reaches maturity he perhaps will fail in his economic and social life. An adequate personality would be an individual who has had a healthy normal childhood, succeeds fairly well with his school work, has no serious difficulty with his playmates, and as he matures finds some degree of success in the industrial world and becomes the head of a satisfactory family. The influences that make for the success or failure of a personality are many. We may classify them as physical, mental, emotional and social, although the same disturbing factor might be upsetting in all phases of development. For instance, a condition that makes for poor health is likely also to result in a lessening of mental vigor, in some emotional upset, and in economic insecurity. It is sometimes difficult to discover just what factor determines certain personality traits, as the causes are often obscure and interlaced. An individual's physical and mental make-up determine to a great extent his health and happiness. A physical handicap or a limited intelligence can be discovered by medical and mental experts, and when discovered give an insight into the individual's particular problem. But an individual with a GUIDE LESSONS FOR JANUARY 617 sound body and a fair intelligence may still present many personality problems. Psychologists are of the opinion that certain 'early emotional experiences and environmental influences greatly affect personality. They claim that a person's likes and dislikes and other various emotional reactions are set at a very early age, perhaps under the age of eight or nine. If certain strong likes are encouraged, certain fears instilled, or certain emotional habits are, cultivated in early youth, the child will be affected by these "fixations" throughout his life. The mental hygiene movement emphasizes the need of treating the abnormal behavior of children in order to insure emotional stability in maturity. The behavior clinic for children which have been established in a number of large cities attempts to understand the reasons underlying abnormal behavior of children who are usually regarded as wayward and delinquent. If a child lies, if he indulges in excessive day-dreaming, if he steals, or if he runs away from home, he is not considered by mental hygienists as a child needing punishment but as a behavior problem needing treatment. Psychiatrists do not attempt to give any general explanation for such various abnormal conduct as lying, stealing, etc., but they attempt to study each child as an individual. No two children respond to the same set of stimuli or to the same experiences in exactly the same manner. Two children of like physical vigor and like mentality, reared in the same home, may conduct themselves in entirely different ways. The psychiatrist in his attempt to understand the child tries to study his personality problem, then to interpret the problem to the parent or teacher and to modify the environment as far as necessary in order to remove the irritating factors.
