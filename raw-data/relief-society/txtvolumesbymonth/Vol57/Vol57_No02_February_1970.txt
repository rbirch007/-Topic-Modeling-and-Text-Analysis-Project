Just a note to thank you for the special attention given to my poem "Sequoia Soil or Desert Sand" in the November issue of the Magazine. It is wonderful what an effective illustration will do to enhance a poem. (Mary Scopes illustration). I think it is due mostly to the pine tree clinging to the edge. I want to tell you how beautiful the Magazine covers are. Each one could be enlarged into a masterpiece. The last one is so much like our Richmond canyons in November—a light skiff of snow on autumn leaves. So often my husband and I climb these trails. I often envy Dorothy Roberts capturing beautiful scenes for her photography and her poetry.

I would like to tell you how much the Magazine affects my life. I have seven young children and am constantly in need of encouragement and comfort. This is given through articles such as "If It's Right We Can Do It," by President Belle S. Spafford (November), and the poignant messages of the editorials. The article "Madonna Keepsakes" by Florence G. Butler (November) has motivated me to make my own collection of Relief Society Madonnas from my library of past Magazines. Needless to say that activity has taken longer than planned, as I rediscovered favorite selections and recipes in the old issues.

*Amy B. Marcusen, Kaysville, Utah*

My mother read the Magazine to me when I lived at home, and I experimented with some of the recipes. While I was in the mission field the Magazine was a regular part of my proselyting tools—it was, ro to speak, my second "companion." Now I am a young housewife and a regular subscriber to the Magazine for myself—and how very precious it is in my home. I read every printed word, absorbing every ounce of love that is contained within the covers. The only problem now is that I have a stiff competitor for the Magazine's attention—my husband. When I was married I was proud of the lovely dowry of handwork I brought to our new home. My husband, on the other hand, had been a regular subscriber to the Magazine throughout college, the service, and his mission, and brought to our home bound copies of each issue since 1954.

*Nadine H. Kerr, San Jose, California*

I would like to express my appreciation for the wonderful Relief Society Magazine which I have had in my home for fifty years. I have served as a Magazine agent in two wards and have found it easy to achieve 100 per cent subscriptions. The beautiful covers are always an inspiration, and I am pleased with the lovely poetry, stories, and recipes—but most of all the beautiful lessons. They all bring joy, courage, comfort, and an increasing testimony.

*Martha Bassett, Boise, Idaho*

The Magazine is full of beauty and full of interesting reading. The lessons give help and information which we very much need. If it were possible to place the Magazine in the homes where the growing children could have the training it provides for both mothers and children, I am sure it would help to lessen the trouble we have these days. It is a small Magazine, but it holds a wealth of information.

*Lola B. Walker, Seaside, California*

I am glad that the Relief Society has such a fine Magazine. I would never be without it. One day a small, lovely woman appeared at my door. She was the Relief Society president making a call on the sick. It was the first time I had talked with anyone from the LDS Church. Then Etta Rees sent me The Relief Society Magazine, and I began to read it to find out the things I needed to know about the great program of Relief Society and of the Church. She has sent me the Magazine for more than five years as a gift. She is the best and dearest sister I have ever had and the most wonderful friend—and I needed one so much in my life.

83 'To Save Souls Elder Marion G. Romney Of the Council of the Twelve [Address Delivered at the Stake Board Session of Relief Society Annual General Conference, October 2, 1969] = The Prophet Joseph Smith, early in the history of the Relief Society, instructed "The Ladies' Relief Society," as he called it then, that it was "not only to relieve the poor but to save souls." This was a charge to the "Ladies" to assist in the Lord's great "... Work and.. -glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man." (Moses 1:39.) It is about this awesome assignment your Relief Society Presidency has asked me to speak a few words this afternoon. The importance of saving souls has frequently been emphasized by the Lord. To John and Peter Whitmer, On separate occasions, he said: - behold, I say unto you, that the thing which will be of the most worth unto you will be to declare repentance unto this people, that you may bring souls unto me, that you may rest with them in the kingdom of my Father... (D&C 15:6; 16:6.) 84 To Cowdery, and David Whitmer, he gave this counsel: Joseph Smith, Oliver Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God; And if it so be that you should labor all your days... And bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father. (D&C 18:10, 15.) These scriptures teach that a soul is saved by being brought back into the "kingdom of God." What he was speaking about when he used the word "soul," the Lord explained by saying "... The spirit and the body are the soul of man." (D&C 88:15.) The word "body" as here used, conveys the same meaning to almost everyone; and Latter-day Saints understand the meaning of the word "spirit." But since our concept of a spirit is not so widely understood, an explanation may be in order. INTELLIGENCE The Lord taught the Prophet Joseph Smith that: Man was in the beginning with God. [That] Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made (D&C 93:29.) And to Abraham, he declared:... T rule in the heavens above, and in the earth beneath... Over all the intelligences thine eyes have seen. As to what he had _ seen, Abraham wrote: Now the Lord had shown unto me... The intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones... For he stood among those that were spirits. (Abraham 3:21-23.) SPIRITS These scriptures teach that the spirits are created from that "'intelligence, or light of truth" which was not created or made, but was in the beginning with God. The Lord revealed the key to the means by which these spirits were created, when he said that the inhabitants of the worlds "'are begotten sons and daughters unto God." (D&C 76: 24.) As to the likeness of these spirit "sons and _ daughters" "begotten... Unto God," we are given a clear understanding in the Book of Ether. It is there stated that it was some 2200 years B. C. That "the Lord showed himself" to the Brother of Jared, and said:... Behold, I am Jesus Christ. Seest thou that ye are created after mine own image? Yea, even all men were created in the beginning after mine own image. Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and man To Save Souls have I created after the body of my spirit; and even as I appear unto thee to be in the spirit will I appear unto my people in the flesh. (Ether 3:14-16.) We further learn through the Prophet, that a spirit has a material body.... All spirit is matter, [he said] but it is more fine or pure, and can only be discerned by purer eyes;. When our bodies are purified we shall see that it is all matter. (D&C 131:7- 8.) THE BIRTH OF SOULS Just before Jesus was born in Bethlehem... The voice of the Lord came unto him [Nephi] saying:... The time is at hand... And on the morrow come I into the world. (3 Ne. 1:12-13.) Accordingly, Jesus Christ, the spirit who had appeared to the Brother of Jared some 2200 years earlier, came "into the world" in a mortal body. As the son of Elohim and Mary, he entered mortality as a living soul. So it has always been. When a mother gives birth to a child, a human soul—a spirit child of God in a mortal body—is born. This is the answer to the Psalmist's query: "What is man?" (Ps. 8:4.) It also gives meaning to the awe-inspired lines of Shakespeare: What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason! How infinite in faculties! In form and moving, how express and admirable! In action, how like an angel! In apprehension, how like a god! (Hamlet Act 2, Scene 2.) THE WORTH OF A SOUL IS MEASURED IN ITS POTENTIAL The Creator endowed all living things with seed in themselves to bring forth offspring having the 85 February 1970 capability to reach, in full matu-. Rity, the likeness of the parent. This is true with the offspring of herbs, animals, and man. It is also true with the offspring of God. Being his begotten spint child, a human soul is endowed with the potential to become like God, his Father.... Now are we the sons of God, [said John] and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him (1 John 3:2.) Jesus enjoined men to aspire to this high station, when he said: Therefore I would that ye should be perfect even as I, or your Father who is in heaven is perfect. (3 Ne. 12:48.) THE PLAN His purpose, to save souls—by bringing to pass their "immortality and eternal life'—God has been pursuing from the beginning. His plan for accomplishing this was announced at the great preearth council, where "there stood among" the spirits, one... Like unto God [who] said unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell; And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them; And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon... And they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads forever and ever. (Abraham 3:24-26.) That we are now human souls is proof that we kept our first estate. And we are assured of being further added upon with immortality. But we are not yet assured of that salvation envisioned by the Prophet Joseph in 86 his charge to the ladies of the Relief Society. In our quest for that salvation, we now face the greatest challenge we have yet met or that we shall ever meet: the challenge to keep our second estate. This requires us to "do all things whatsoever the Lord" our God commands us. If we succeed, we "shall have glory added upon... [our] heads forever and ever." We shall become perfect, even as Jesus and our Father in heaven are perfect. This is what it means to be saved. If some of you should now ask what this long discourse has to do with our charge to "save souls," this would be my answer. I have sought to remind you of what a soul is; of its infinite value, and potential; what it means to save a soul, and how a soul may be saved, because I believe that a knowledge of these things is necessary if we are to be effective in our efforts to help save souls. I believe that a guide who would lead another must have a correct understanding of the desired goal; of what it means to reach it, and how to reach it, and be on the way himself. I am convinced that it is one's clear and constant view of these things which gives him motivation and guidance. It has been the vision of Zion, with the hope and expectation of securing a place therein, which has held the righteous on course through the ages. President Young, back in the 1850's, reminded a group of saints that it was not.. A vision of driving cattle across the plains... Where you would be mired in this or that mudhole [nor of] the stampedes among the cattle, and those of a worse character among the people, [but the] vision of Zion...

Am I glad! Ladies of the Relief Society who understand and appreciate what we have here said concerning the saving of souls and the influence of their absence from home upon their children, will not leave their homes except under the most stringent circumstances. In no other area of their great work, can "The Ladies' Relief Society" do more to save souls than in motivating themselves, and all other women in —- the Church, to plant in the minds and hearts of their children the aspirations which inspired Eliza R. Snow's great poem: I'll serve the Lord while I am young, And in my early days, Devote the music of my tongue To my Redeemer's praise. I'll praise His name, that He has giv'n Me parentage and birth Among the most beloved of heav'n That dwell upon the earth.

And, like the faithful ones of old Who now behold Thy face, May I be formed in virtue's mould To fill a holy place. That this may be our goal and success, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. — UNCLAIMED HERITAGE Did you say, '(Come back when England's winds Blow over marsh and meadow land; When hedge sparrows warble to The dawning day's command?"'

Presented by permission of the Queen. ] w I wish to pay my respects to the chiefs and nobles assembled here today, my respects to the wife of the British Consul who is with us today, my special regards to President Tanner and his wife who are here from America, and to President Groberg our own Tongan Mission President, and his wife who are here also today. Also my regards to the leaders of the various women's organizations in the various churches in 90 Tonga who are here today, and my special regards to the members of the Relief Society organization of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who, of course, represent the main reason we are here today. It is always a pleasure for me to take part in any meeting which has as its purpose the giving of thanks or praise for good work which has been accomplished. I want to thank especially all of you members of the Relief Society for the great work you have done and which is demonstrated here today. We must remember, however, that it is always our responsibility as women in Tonga or aS women anywhere in the world to perform this type of work lovingly and carefully, and to make the home we live in more pleasant. There are two words I would like to use to base my talk upon. I hope it will be helpful to some of us here this afternoon. The first word is husband, and the second word is wife. The word husband comes from two English words, namely house and band. We can see then that this word basically means that which wraps around or solidifies or strengthens the house and provides protection and support thereto. And this is the case, for truly it is the husband who provides the protection and support and indeed ties together all of the various elements connected with the house. If he is a good husband, he provides everything that is needful for the family with his work and his efforts and with his ability to do things that only men can do, such as heavy work, building homes, etc. _ We must always remember that this responsibility is fulfilled from the husband's heart, for, indeed, in his home is everything that is valuable to him—his wife, his children, and their love and respect. Naturally he desires his family to have the best of everything possible, be it government, church, family, or any other association. How very, very blessed is the woman to whom God has given such a husband. Now there may be a few women who would tend to say, "I am grateful to God for the, religious understanding and light that I have, but it is a real burden to me that my husband does not understand religious truths Weaving the Fabric of Home Life as I do, and does not live by these family or eternal truths as he should." If this happens to be the particular burden of a Christian woman, and she begins to think that the burden is very heavy for her to carry, some may even go as far as to feel that they should make a change in their marital relationship. If there is anyone who thinks this way, I would like to read to you from the Bible a passage which I believe applies directly to such women, and I believe this passage of scripture will be a source of strength and comfort to you and help you to carry on. This scripture is found in the New Testament in the Book of First Corinthians, Chapter 7, and reads as follows:... If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away. And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him. For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy. But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace. For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? Or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife? 'Now, my dear fellow women, if you can be completely unselfish and meek and humble and have the true spirit of Christian love and be guided by the Holy Ghost in your actions and words I am certain that as you work with these influences you can indeed ot February 1970 become an instrument in the hands of God to change the heart of your husband for the better that he may become truly Christian also. Now the second word that I want to speak about is the word wife. The meaning of the word wife is something we probably all wonder about. Why is it that we women who are married are called wives? I feel that we can learn quite a bit from the origin of this word. The word wife originally comes from the verb which means to weave. In the very early days linen or cloth was woven in each separate home. Even the thread was made in each separate home with a machine called the spinning wheel. Then when there was enough thread it was made into cloth on a machine called a hand loom. Originally, the wife was the one who did this weaving or making of the cloth. I would like to quote again from the Bible, this time from' the Old Testament, the Book of Proverbs which says: She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands. She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff. She maketh fine linen, and selleth it. (Proverbs 31:13, 19, 24.) The husband, as_ previously mentioned, has the responsibility for all of those things from the outside to tie the home together, but the wife has the responsibility and opportunity of weaving the fabric of home life. This is done inside the home in order to provide the necessary happiness for her family. And you know, fellow women, as far as I am concerned, this is the most beautiful weaving and the most important weaving 92 that is done anywhere in the world—weaving the fabric of your home life. And how beautiful is that fabric if woven by a true Christian woman or wife, especially a Christian woman such as one described in the Book of Proverbs and one who sincerely has the desire to make her husband and her children and her family happy. In any weaving there are bound to be those moments of trial and temptation which we must overcome, for all is not easy. There will be those days when we will get tired of the constant weaving which we are doing. The fabric of our home will be colored by the various problems and hardships which come our way, but if successfully overcome, these only add to the beauty of the overall design. Yes, if we have love in our hearts and understanding in our hearts, these problems thus overcome act as gold and silver threads which are stronger than any other threads which may come our way. If we can just be unselfish and have a sincere desire to love and serve our families and also be brave and strong in the work we are called to do, we can weave this most beautiful of all fabrics. Wives, mothers, just how is the fabric of your home? Are you weaving beautifully and orderly through peace and love or are you one of those wives who weaves in a disorderly fashion—a wife who leaves the weaving loom of her home and goes outside in an attempt to find her own happiness and joy which she can never find outside of her own. Particular assignment at home? There are so many women nowadays who are crying for their freedom and their rights to be free from the traditional responsibilities of the home and family. This class of women will never be able to weave the beautiful fabric necessary to have a peaceful home unless they repent and return unto that which they are privileged by God to do. One other point I would like to mention is to ask all of the mothers here to remember that the fabric of the lives of our children, their characters, is largely determined by the weaving that they observe us doing. They not only learn from us but we actually weave the fabric of their lives for them in their tender years. In fact we actually begin weaving the pattern of their lives before they are even born. Yes, one of our most important weaving assignments is our children. Weaving the Fabric of Home Life We must always remember that the life of our children is made up of three parts—that is body, mind, and spirit. There are many of us who provide all the necessary things for their body, and encourage them strongly in their academic pursuits to develop their minds, but we must remember that if we do not feed and help and_ support their spirits Wwe are in fact being negligent of that portion of our children which is by far the most valuable—their eternal spirits. How happy should be the mother or wife who is able to answer thusly: Yes, in the love and grace of God my spirit does live and the spirit of my husband and the spirits of my children live despite the hardships of this uncertain world. My love to all. I thank you for this opportunity. ON PRIORITIES Let me lean on your love tonight; Tomorrow's crowded moments might Find me frantic with the need To frost small cakes with poppy seed For eager Scouts, to soothe the cares Of wee ones tripped by treacherous stairs. Perhaps, awhile, a child again, I'll stay my aging father when His loneliness spills over.... All Day long, whatever task or call, A sister's sorrow, a daughter's tears, A lesson written on the Pioneers, Whatever has priority— Mother, daughter, wife—I'll be.

Franks 'Win A ae ~e w In the Southwest where [ live, we have no February snow, but this morning great heavy clouds swooped down over the foothills, bringing the winter rains. A good day, I decided, casting aside the morning paper, to put a cake in the oven. This accomplished, I started a gelatin salad for the next day's luncheon. I had not realized it was Valentine's Day until Patrick, my threeyear-old neighbor, zigzagged through the puddles to my backdoor for his usual morning visit. He dried his feet on my throw rug while, in one breath, he greeted me with the morning news. "My daddy couldn't start his car and Skippy Cat got caught in the rain. Know what? Terry took all the valentines to school."'. Wiping his wet hands on his pant's leg, he walked directly to the living room and_ looked around. He came back to the kitchen and pulled himself up on the maple, round-seated stool I had left beside the kitchen cupboard. | "Did the mailman leave you some envelopes?" he asked. "Yes," I replied, "two." <a SOS, 4, a —= A moment of silence. "Then where are your valentines?" he asked. Apparently, he felt concerned because he had not discovered valentines lined along my livingroom mantelpiece, nor found any standing in my window sill above my kitchen sink. Patrick's eyes sobered in thought as he sat on the stool silently brooding. Knowing Patrick, I guessed he must be worried because my friends had forgotten to send valentines. The fact that I live alone has troubled Patrick for some time. He senses my "aloneness," and tries in his three-year-old way to help me, and be company for me. My big, quiet house appalls him. He is one of four children, and although the silence puzzles him, I suspect at times, it is a haven of privacy for him. Here he has my undivided attention, and over the past year we have become good, trusted friends. I felt, as he sat there watching me mix cranberries into the gela- tin, that the valentine situation was bothering him. Therefore I explained to him that my friends, our age, sent different kinds of cards. "Get well cards, birthday cards—these cards convey messages of love," I said. ""They don't always have to be heart-shaped like valentines." He listened, then abruptly jumped down from the stool. "T've got to go home now," he said. He turned and ran out the door before I could hand him my umbrella. This was unusual for Patrick. He always waited for the cake to come out of the oven so that he could have the first piece. But he had dashed across the yard, looking like a giant butterfly floating through the rain. In five minutes he was back, calling from the outside step. As I opened the door, I saw he carried something in his arms. Raindrops, dripping from his red and blue plaid shirt sleeves, dropped to the floor. His eyes watched my face as his small steady hands held out an old, blue, oval-shaped flower bowl with two rocks centered on the bottom. On top of one rock sat one of the tiniest turtles I'd ever seen. Stretching its skinny neck out from a brightly decorated shell, it looked up at me. "He's yours—I'm giving him to you," Patrick said, his face aglow. Sensing the magnitude of the gift, I assured him that the turtle was exactly what I needed for company. "T'll keep it here in the window sill while I'm working in the kitchen," I explained jubilantly. "When I go upstairs, I'll take the turtle with me.", An Odd-Shaped Valentine "He's a valentine," Patrick exclaimed quickly, because I hadn't already guessed. Surprise vanished from my eyes momentarily as I considered the thoughtfulness of his act. A gentle smile checked my heartfelt tears. "Patrick, this is the nicest valentine I have ever received," I said shakily, taking the wiggly turtle out in my hand. "But he's not shaped like one, is he?" Patrick questioned. I felt certain that Patrick was reminding me of what I had told him only minutes before about grownup valentines. "No, he's not heart-shaped," I answered, "but because you gave him to me on Valentine's Day, my only valentine, he'll always be heart-shaped to me." That was enough for. Patrick. Evidently my expression told him that I had accepted the gift as he had intended, with love. Then because my valentine started to crawl out of my hand, our smiles burst into giggles, and as Patrick watched proudly I placed the pet back into the bowl. Afterwards, I removed the cake from the oven, set the breakfast nook table with two red placemats, cut us each a piece of chocolate cake, poured two glasses of milk, and then the two of us sat down to a pleasant, Valentine Day snack. While our conversation consisted mostly of the care and feeding of miniature turtles, I thought of what I had learned that day, for secretly I had learned something delightfully new about the odd shape of val-. Entines. 95 EDITORIAL / On Contemplation m= Did you ever stop to think that every book written, every picture painted, every building erected, every play enacted, every car driven was conceived mentally and had its beginning with ideas inside someone's mind? Someone deliberately thought and thought until ideas became realities, a whole procession of ideas became workable inventions, artistic expressions, articulate expositions. Did you ever stop to think that only those who stop to think make progress equal to their capabilities? Do you ever stop to think? Do you ever meditate, summon from your heart and mind the things that need your most considered judgment? Do you see in meditation an opportunity to renew yourself, to build your self-confidence; to revitalize and gather new strength, not dwelling upon weaknesses or failures but upon better ways to accomplish tasks; to refresh with greater determination; to reflect upon events of your life that were pure joy; and to create constructive attitudes and enthusiasm? Do you take time to contemplate, to bring your mental powers and resources to work out your problems, to form your judgments? When decisions must be reached do you pause to map your course, to | think through to a conclusion the probable consequences of a contemplated action? Your head should be allowed to guide your feet to keep you from an impulsive action which could be a disaster. Thought-: ful consideration may save many mistakes. Contemplation is not idle- ) ness though it requires a certain stillness and freedom from physical activity. Contemplation does not squander time but makes time more valuable. — Volume 57 February 1970 Number 2 THE GENERAL BOARD Belle S. Spafford, President Marianne C. Sharp, First Counselor Louise W.

Rosemary Addis Sheffield, England w The loud clamour of the alarm clock brought Janet to abrupt wakefulness from her deep sleep. David's arm extricated itself from under the warmth of the bed clothes and reached up to Switch off the alarm. The luminous hands of the clock pointed to five minutes past six. Another few minutes and he would heave himself reluctantly out of bed and prepare for the day's work ahead. David preferred to get up on quick breakfast, and see himself off to work. "I can get off much quicker without you," he had told Janet right from the start. "You only slow me up." Janet had not argued with him, she was quite content to remain in bed a little longer. In her estimation seven o'clock was quite early enough to rise, and it gave her half an hour to herself before calling Eric, their son, who at this moment was asleep in the next room. Usually, first thing in the morning, Janet was slow to come his own, have a € to. She was a very sound sleeper. When, in the transition from sleep to wakefulness she gave David silly answers in reply to anything he Said, he would chuckle and say, half in exasperation, "That's my girl." But this morning her mind was alert, and immediately the thought was there—this is our anniversary, our twentieth anniversary. Will he remember? Shall] I whisper to him "Happy anniversary, darling?" No! She decided. I'll see if he remembers. As the minutes ticked away it was obvious David did not remember. A brief hug, a kiss, and a "See you tonight" and she heard him running down the stairs. Janet lay still, a little wave of hurt and disappointment Sweeping over her. Perhaps there would be a card or a little something on the table to show that he had remembered. At this thought her spirits lifted, and as soon as she heard the front door close after David, she slipped out of bed, wrapped herself in her dressing 99 "eT ON February 1970 gown, and hurried downstairs to the kitchen. A quick glance at the table brought to her vision a bottle of milk, a packet of cornflakes, and some dirty dishes and cutlery. Janet sat down despondently. One would have thought that after all these years she would have hardened herself to this forgetfulness on David's part to remember anniversaries and birthdays but, somehow, she still felt the hurt. She cast her mind back to the early years of their marriage. Eric had been born during the war years while David was still doing active service abroad. He had just had his first birthday when his daddy was finally demobbed from the army. She hadn't been upset at the lack of anniversary remembrances during those first years, she had been only too thankful to receive the fairly regular blue penciled letters from him. It was later on when they were settling down to home life together that she began to feel hurt by his seeming lack of sentiment on what, to her, were important days, days to be remembered and cherished. On one occasion she had sulked for two or three days, hardly speaking to him, and it didn't help any when her friends showed her the gifts they had received from their husbands, and when she heard them talking about the wonderful plans that had been made for a celebration evening. As time went on, however, Janet began to realize that forgetfulness was a part of her husband's make-up. She realized, too, by the expression on David's face 100 and his contrite spirit, that she was not the only one to feel hurt because he had not remembered a special day. So it became her practise to remind him a few days beforehand, but even that didn't always work. She had not reminded him of this day, nor had she said anything to Eric either. Eric! It was time he was up and getting ready to go to technical college. Janet went to the bottom of the stairs and called up to her son. She knew from experience this would be the first of several] calls. Like herself, he was slow to rouse himself. Eventually she heard the water running in the bathroom and she began to prepare his breakfast. It wasn't long before Eric made his appearance —a tall, rangy young man, dark hair still tousled. Never very talkative first thing in the morning, Eric answered her questions in a series of grunts, but before he left the house, she gathered that he was bringing Rachel, his girl, home with him that evening. Janet was pleased. She liked Rachel, a sweet-natured girl who showed great strength of character at times. She knew that Eric and Rachel would eventually marry, they had been going steady for six months now, and Rachel was quite prepared to wait until Eric had finished at college. As Janet went about her work, her mind became occupied once more with this anniversary day. Twenty years! Why, it was a milestone in their lives. She couldn't let it pass unnoticed. Twenty years of loving companionship, trust, the sharing of so many happy times together, the three of them. What if David did forget anniversaries, what about all the other little thoughtful acts he did at other times, the unexpected flowers and chocolates? It suddenly occurred to Janet that she herself had made no plans to make this day a special day. She had been waiting for David to do it all. This thought came as a revelation to her, and lifted the last mists of hurt and resentment. She planned her day. First, the room extra shining and bright. Then the menu. Both her men loved mixed grill, so that was a must. She would have orange meringue pie to follow. A cake —she must make an extra nice cake, but it wouldn't have to be too complicated, there wasn't time. She remembered the cake recipes in the drawer. David was always tearing cake recipes that looked extra luscious out of her weekly woman's magazine in the hope that she would take the hint and bake him one. Now was the time. She chose a large chocolate cake sandwiched with cream and smothered in cherries. She had never tried a combination of chocolate and cherries before. Janet was thankful for the little reserve of money she had been diligently trying to save these past weeks. Now she could make a little splash in her purchases. Once she had the cake in the oven, Janet set about moving the one and only table from the kitchen into the dining room. No eating in the kitchen tonight. Moving the table from the kitchen, through the narrow hall into the dining room, was really a two-man job, but she set to with great determination and, after Happy Anniversary much _ puffing achieved her goal. She fetched her best white linen cloth and spread it on the table. Carefully she set out her new china set and the cutlery. From the garden she plucked a gay assortment of the flowers in bloom and made an attractive arrangement of them which she placed in the center of the table. As Janet stood back to survey the effect, the colour and beauty of the flowers filled her with a sense of joy, and a silent prayer of thankfulness went up to the one who was Creator of such perfection. The despondency of the early morning seemed as if it had never been, and in its place was a happy mood of anticipation. Oh! She must not forget the bottle of Peardrax, a favorite fruit drink for all of them. They would be able to use it for a toast to the happy occasion. The hands of the clock seemed to be flying around. The cake had been given its final touches and was beautiful to behold. She hoped. Fervently it would taste as good as it looked. She seemed to have so many baking catastrophes when it came to trying something new. The orange meringue pie had turned out just as she had hoped it would and looked tempting. Now for the main course. When all was near completion Janet went upstairs and washed, and changed into the pretty soft green dress which she knew David liked her in best of all, and by the time she had put some fresh make-up on, she felt lke a new woman. As she made her way downand panting, 101 February 1970 stairs again there was a loud rat-tat at the door. Eric and Rachel were the first to arrive. Ushering them into the room, Janet noticed with satisfaction how warm and inviting it looked with the fire blazing cheerfully in the hearth. Eric looked at the table with all its signs of festivity. "What's going on, Mum, are we having a celebration or something?" Janet nodded and smiled. "Yes! Your dad and I have been married twenty years today, so I thought it would be nice to have a little celebration." "Oh, Mum," said Eric, "why didn't you tell me? I would have sent a card." He hugged his mother, and Rachel, too, came forward impulsively to embrace her and offer congratulations. In the midst of all this, David's familiar rat-a-tat-tat-tat sounded at the door. Although he had a key of his own, David still liked to have the door opened by his wife, to have her welcome him home. Tonight he stood outside the door, a sheepish grin on his face, his hands behind his back. For a few moments they looked at each other, then, as he stepped into the house, he brought from behind him an enormous box of chocolates. "For you" he said, a soft expression in his brown eyes. As they went into the room together, David's eyes took in all her preparations, and turning to her, he explained how, as he had been glancing through the newspaper during his lunch hour, he had noticed the date and remembered it was their anniversary. Putting his arm around her, he looked at her, his whole heart in his eyes, and as he kissed her he whispered "Happy anniversary, darling." Janet's happiness was full, and as she looked into the dear smiling faces of those who meant so much to her, the words echoed in her heart. "Happy, happy aniniversary." edo A HAPPY DAY They say that happiness is an elusive thing That merely touches one, then flits away; But happiness came in my door quite recently And did my bidding when | told it ''stay."' A morning spent in my old brown rocking chair With ears toward the television screen To hear the words of truth from men of God Uplifted me and made my home serene.

Clough - ~, S"_ gPHOTOGRAPH BY DOROTHY J, ROBERTS Make A New Start With Alaskan Sourdough Edythe K. Watson Member, General Board of Relief Society @ Our visit to Alaska was the culmination of a lifetime's dream. As a teenager I had read the exciting, colorful adventure stories of this vast territory. This had been coupled with the impressive, spiritual experiences related to me by my husband who had labored in Alaska as one of its first missionaries. I felt a special feeling of kinship for that land and its people. I had hoped that someday I, too, might go there, see its great beauty, view its wide expanse, and meet its people. From my first glimpse of its rocky shoreline as we touched down in Sitka, to a leisurely trip through the golden heart of Alaska, to a breathtaking glimpse of Mt. McKinley from the air as we sped homeward, I was impressed. I felt that perhaps now I understood what beckons people to this land. Those who met with us were preponderantly young. They are vigorous, capable, dedicated saints. Their beautiful chapel was impressive and inviting. The flowers all about were exquisite in their intensity of color and were amazingly large and beautiful. Pansies which graced our charming breakfast 104 table were as large as a cup. The trees in their fall raiment were a striking contrast to the ruggedness of the landscape. Alaska's very atmosphere seemed to flood one's senses with a feeling of excitement and adventure. This forty-ninth state is sometimes known as the Last Frontier. Its name is taken from a word meaning Great Land. Modern day pioneers have carved their homes, villages, and cities from this rugged country despite. The hardships and the rigors of the North. During the past forty years Latter-day Saints have made their contribution, have helped to modernize this new state. Church members have made their influence felt. Our sisters have played an important role. Despite obstacles, deprivation, and hardship, they have worked side by side with their husbands in establishing good homes, using the resources, commodities, and _ foodstuffs available to them. For many years the Alaskan homemaker found it necessary to make her own bread. Much of the food supply had to be shipped in. Yeast, a necessary requisite to breadmaking, could become de- activated before it reached its destination. Sourdough then became the basis for their staff of life. The "sourdough pot" became a valuable possession. Sourdough is an interesting term, having several definitions. It may mean an Alaskan oldtimer, or it may mean a yeasty starter for leavening bread, hot cakes, waffles, muffins, even cake. Sourdough starter is long lasting. Someone has said that it is as tough and indomitable as its oldtimer namesake. Between the camps it was the last item placed in the pack sack, the first item removed at each new encampment. Settlers sometimes walked miles for a starter because it was so vital to their sustenance. Many of the Twentieth Century Alaskans still use the sourdough starter which provides nutritious foods for their families. Missionaries in Alaska find it inexpensive, quick, and simple to use. MAKING THE STARTER The starter must be set the night before you wish to use it. If it is replenished every week with flour and water it can last for months, even years. One lovely Relief Society sister in Fairbanks had continued her starter for over twenty years. Last year she made thirty new starts from it, which were sold at the Relief Society bazaar to the delight of ward members. Sampling delicious sourdough bread made from this start was a highlight of our visit to the Alaskan saints. A starter which I carried home with me is proving a delight to use and has given Make a New Start With Alaskan Sourdough me new interest in breadmaking. Sourdough hotcakes, waffles and muffins have a special delectable flavor—one which would delight any family. Make a starter for your own use. It is simple to do in our modern day. It may also prove useful for those who have canyon homes, those who enjoy camping out, or who take fishing or hunting expeditions—and for all who prefer sourdough bread. The following instructions and recipes have been carefully prepared and graciously shared by the sisters of the Alaska Stake. The Alaska Extension Service supplied some of the details used. For best results use glass or pottery containers. Never use a metal container or leave a metal spoon in the starter. CH) SOURDOUGH STARTER 2 c. Flour 2 c. Warm water 1 package dry yeast Make this starter only when you have forgotten to save a start, or when you are making it for the first time. Combine ingredients and mix well. Place in a warm place or closed cupboard overnight. In the morning put 12 c. Of the starter in a scalded pint jar with a tight lid and store in the refrigerator or a cool place for future use. This is sourdough starter. The remaining batter can be used immediately for pancakes, waffles, muffins, bread or cake. To use the starter again, place it in a medium-size mixing bowl. Add 2 c. Milk and 2 c. Flour. Beat well and set in a warm place to develop overnight. In the morning the batter will have gained 1% again its bulk and be covered with air bubbles. It will have a pleasant yeasty odor. Now, set aside 2 c. Sponge in the refrigerator jar for your sourdough starter for next time. 105 SOURDOUGH HOTCAKES 1 tsp. Salt 1 tbsp. Sugar 1 tsp.

Welch My companion and I feel a need to meet the challenge of visiting teaching each month with a prayer for the Lord to magnify us in this calling that we may have understanding hearts and discernment in meeting the needs of the sisters we visit. We have found that its blessings flow both ways. Occasionally, physical help is appreciated. In some homes we need to give patience and a listening ear, for the shutins have a need to talk and unburden themselves. We can learn of gentility and devotion from the sweet-faced little mother, while we pray silently for an opportunity to interest her in the gospel truths. We can learn of tranquility and acceptance of facets of life which could not be changed, from the sister who had fun in her covered wagon journeys. There was no hint of complaint for hardships involved, nor for the harshness of life which necessitated them. We can learn of the sweetness of service from the sister who spent so many years of giving of herself and her time to her aged neighbor. And from the sister whose energy, zest for living, and creativeness, belie her seventy-five years, we can learn thrift, ingenuity, love of and use for the commonplace things of life, and peace with self and fellow man. As the words and actions of these sisters touch and bless our lives, we pray that our messages and the spirit of Relief Society may enrich theirs. And if our visits have reached less than the potentials desired this month, may our sympathies be deepened and our understandings be broadened in our future visits.

Krambule w As warm weather' unfolds tender, young leaves overhead, many young mothers begin to ask themselves, ""What can I do to keep the children happily occupied and off the street?" The answer lies in well-planned playground equipment—and that doesn't necessarily mean expensive equipment. Nursery school supervisors are quick to agree that while swings and slippery slides are nice, these standard playground items are often not used, while their im- 108 aginative charges spend hours engrossed with playthings which we sometimes classify as junk. The problem, they say, is not a matter of money, but in knowing what to select or build that will stimulate the everactive imaginations of the young. Consider, for instance the wooden packing box, one of the most popular items in the nursery playground. Several of these boxes in a series of sizes provide all sorts of possibilities for the young and active minds of children, especially those between the ages of two and ten. With inexhaustible energy, they climb in and out of the boxes, hide from each other in or behind them, push them around to form various structures, and turn them upsidedown to stand or pound on. One minute these sturdy boxes may be taking children to town with a loud choo-choo, only to be magically transformed into skyscrapers minutes later. Add several planks to these boxes and there are still more possibilities. The children will place a plank across two of the boxes to walk along' or jump from, and then most likely use it for a springboard—more fun than you can imagine. One end of the plank will perhaps be placed on a box and the other on the ground. The kiddies will walk up and down it and even use it as a slide. They may put it across a box and climb inside—they have a roof over them now. While stocking your children's playground with these inexpensive but beloved crates and planks, you will probably wonder about the dangers involved. How many times, you may ask yourself, will there be falls, smashed fingers and _ slivers? It will be wise, of course, to sand the boxes and planks—especially on edges and corners— and apply some non-toxic paint. This will eliminate the ravages of splinters. As for pinched fingers and falls, these, unhappily, are an inevitable part of play. According to nursery school observers, if you were to sit down unnoticed to watch a group of children play for several hours, the session would probably be more wearing for you than for the kiddies. You would see them lose their balance and instantly regain it, tip a box almost on their toes only to step back barely in time, and narrowly escape pinching their fingers under planks—reminding you perhaps of their toddler days when they walked crazily through doorways, narrowly escaping a bump on the head. Actually, a fall seldom rates more than a whimper, unless older folks are in view with ready sympathy. Penny-Wise Playgrounds "Give children a chance to be creative,' plead experts in the field of child development. And sandboxes, they say, are wonderful—particularly if they are equipped with digging and molding utensils such as shovels and pails, and if the sand is kept moist so that it can be formed easily. A little foresight in providing end sections of egg or orange crates to sit on will keep the children dry. Small sawhorses, according to one instructor in child development, are a favorite among children. Be assured that no matter what the age of the youngster using them, he will be practical in finding many uses for this particular investment. One Utah nursery school provides a good muscle-builder in the form of an old dead tree, debarked and with the thick sturdy limbs cut back to within two or three feet from the trunk. Resting on several of these branches in a semi-upright position, gives safe climbing for any number of pretend games the children may' concoct. Other variations of this idea include logs cut varying lengths and placed on end in the ground for climbing from one round to another. Another favorite among preschoolers—wooden blocks—cost nothing. Scrap pieces in odd shapes and sizes are easily obtainable at planing mills or can be found at building sites. An ample number of these, sanded and stored in a plastic clothes basket, provide many hours of enjoyment edged with education. Another item to be had for the asking is an old steering 109 February 1970 wheel. Mount it on a pipe or pole anchored in the ground and watch how often Johnny goes for a ride in his new sports car, speed boat, or airplane. The possibilities are limitless, even though the budget may not be. Add stakes for horseshoe pitching or a pole for tether ball, construct your own brand of jungle gym, or pour cement rounds for jumping stones. But there is one thing you must not do: You must not plan the play yard for parent appeal as is so often done. Give the children the things they want—toys that will develop them and their thinking, and give them a section of the yard to call their own. Hedge it off if you wish, but let them make play real child's play. The Creek Taught Me Anny M. Campbell From where I sit here in our living room, my eyes rest on a pretty white rock on our bookshelf. This rock brings beautiful memories back to me One evening last summer, while the sun was setting, my husband, our son, and I, went on a trip in the mountains. We found a fine place for camping. After supper, we put up our cots. Then we knelt together in prayer, and went to bed. I lay awake for sometime, looking up at the stars. The stillness felt soothing. The only sound was a very soft lulling sound. I asked my husband what he thought it was. From his cot, close by mine, he answered sleepily, "I guess it is the wind through the treetops." A little later, I knew that both my husband and our boy were sound asleep. I was still wide awake, listening to that soft little sound in the great stillness. Suddenly, I knew what it was. It was a creek—and not far off. I will go and find it in the morning, I thought happily. The sun was shining when I woke up and had already been looking around a bi I followed the little path he showed me. The creek. On this note I fell asleep. The next morning. My husband was up, t. He told me there was a creek nearby. It was short, and ended by the edge of As I looked at the sunlight glittering in the clear, sparkling water, thoughts flowed through my mind. This creek is like life. Up, there was a bend. The creek seemed to hid it from sight. I well knew it did not e mountains. Neither do our lives start back i I looked up the creek, just a little way narrow down there, and ferns and leaves nd there, but it came from far up in the n hazy infancy, they also come around the bend, from high up, and far away, I thought. Then I looked at the rocks in the creek—some small, others quite large. They were of many soft colors. The water rushed over and around them. What beautiful obstacles they are! | thought, and what exquisite noises they create. They make the creek sing. Obstacles become opportunities to create music in our lives, and beauty in our souls.

Toad Synopsis: Jerusha has been invited by the Wilson's young son Dennis to spend the night when her car breaks down near their home in Utah. She finds the home in charge of the young teen-aged daughter since the death of the mother. There are Paul (the father), Dennis, Suzie, Joe, the eldest who resents Jerusha's presence from the first moment, and little Amy who will not associate with anyone outside the family. M Pancakes seemed to be a long neglected treat at the Wilson breakfast table. Jerusha was barely able to keep up with the rapidly disappearing hot goodies. She naturally left her own plate 112 empty trying to keep the others' filled. She sensed this was of concern to Paul, but she flashed him a smile. "In a few minutes my turn will come," she assured him. "These are sure good," Dennis said, pouring syrup on his seventh. "Why don't you stay with us a week, Jerusha? Suzey never makes pancakes." Joe spoke up quickly. "Don't be silly, Den. I'm sure our guest needs to be on her way wherever she's going." "But she's not going anywhere." Dennis insisted. "She told me she lived two thousand miles away, and she was tired of being there. Anyway, her car's worn out. We pushed it down in the sunflowers." Joe's eyes flashed. "Oh, why don't you cool it, Den!" "Never mind, Joe," Mr. Wilson broke in, looking strangely at the guest. "Let's see what Jerusha has to say." He put down his fork, with his eyes steadfastly on her face—a kind of peculiarly solicitous look. "We don't have much to offer, and we don't expect you to work all the time, but we'd like to have you stay on with us for awhile." "Why, thank you, Mr. Wilson," Jerusha said, smiling and sitting down in front of her plate. "T'll be right happy to." Through the corner of her eye she caught the glimpse of a scowl on Joe's face, but he got up and left the table, and at thesame time another wheel began turning in her mental machine. So the week passed, and nobody said anything about Jerusha's leaving. She and Suzey cleaned the junk out of the small back room that had been used for storage, hung up some _ pink striped curtains at the window and moved in her suitcase. She set Dennis to painting up the old iron bedstead leaning in the corner, and Paul brought home a set of new springs and a mattress. - "There," she said, eyeing the new quarters with satisfaction. "It's almost too elegant for an old highway tramp. When I braid a rug for the floor, you'll all want to trade with me." The second week passed, and to most of the Wilsons it had already begun to seem as though Jerusha Spends the Night there were only two times to remember, once when there was a real wife and mother, and once when there was Jerusha. It was just a matter of course when the holes disappeared in the knees of Dennis's overalls and neat patches took their places, and the safety pins became substituted on Amy's playsuit for a pair of bunny rabbit buttons. Suzey came out wearing a new dress stitched from some cloth Jerusha found in a drawer. Things began to happen to the house, too. No one knew for sure when the curtains in the living room window took on new life, but one day as Paul drove up the lane on his way home from town, he suddenly realized they were fresh and alive. He drove into the yard and sat for a minute looking. Then he got out of the car and started to the house. It was then he saw Jerusha and Dennis fussing with the ragged flowers along the fence. Jerusha was decked out in an old slat sunbonnet and one of his wornout shirts she must have found in a closet. It was big enough to put two Jerushas in. She had a spade and was going after the earth in dead earnest. "T ought to have my camera," Paul laughed, "I'll bet I could win a prize with your picture." Jerusha stuck the spade into the ground and pushed the bonnet back on her neck. The damp gray curls twisted about her face like corkscrews. "Well," she said, quite unembarrassed at her appearance, "these bachelor's-buttons needed some unbuttoning, and this was the best I could find to keep the sun from drying me up completely." 113 February 1970 His face grew suddenly sober. "Tt think you look wonderful, Jerusha—just like the window curtains. They look wonderful, too." She turned and eyed the window. "I guess they do look a little fresher, don't they?" "Everything is better around here since you came. I—I don't know how to thank you." He paused and gazed at her, his fine masculine features filled with emotion. "I guess I've been afraid to mention it to you before for fear that you might tell me you were leaving." "Never said anything about leaving," Jerusha said casually. A quick light leaped into his eyes. He cleared his throat. "Do —do you mean we could make some sort of arrangement for you to stay on? Maybe I couldn't compete with wages where you came from, but I'm sure I could arrange for a comfortable...." She stopped him with a wave of her hand. "You ought to know by the looks of me I'm not a money-making institution," she said. "Just enough to buy me a yard or two of cloth for an apron once in awhile and a few hairpins to keep my hair out of my eyes." She looked out across the fields. "T like this country air. Maybe it's even better than West Virginia's."' Then her eyes traveled up his stature to his face, "And I'll be hanged if I don't like you, too, son." He stood a moment staring mutely down at her. "It's been a long time," he said, "since I had a mother to call me that." Dennis had been sitting on the ground digging in the dirt with a stick. Skeeter was lying nearby 114 roasting in the sun, and Dennis kept piling dirt onto the dog to watch him shake it off. Now he looked up at Jerusha excitedly. "You mean you're going to stay and live with us?" he asked exuberantly. "Why, of course I am," Jerusha said. "Here, shake hands with your new foreman." They shook ~ hands, and she added, with a wink, "So you'd better get your dandelion digger oiled up!" "Yeow!" Dennis shouted, "golly, goody!' and he made three somersaults across the flower patch. It was ironical that she should look up and see Joe standing by the corner of the house just at that moment. He was staring fixedly, his forehead creased into a scowl, but, as she looked, he turned and disappeared around the house. "What about Joe?" she asked, with her hand on Skeeter rubbing against her legs. Paul looked at her with a quiet smile. "Joe has a much nicer side you haven't met. You'll think of something," he said. For a minute she was silent, then she spoke musingly, "Maybe." She patted the dog's head. "But he's a tough one." Then she walked over and picked up the pliers she had waiting under a rosebush. She held them out to him. "Don't you think that gate's getting tired leaning on one foot?" she asked. "And after that, Dennis needs his hair clipped. It's just about long enough to hang a cat with." Paul smiled again and took the pliers. "Guess I just needed you to bring it to my attention. Pll get right at them both." And he started toward the gate. Jerusha looked toward the corner where Joe had disappeared. "Now, if I could just get Joe to paint the house and fence," she said half aloud, '"'maybe..." The first Sunday had been a new experience for Jerusha. She had never found a church that interested her enough to do much about it, even though she had attended several, and even had been affiliated with one for a short time. But when the family showed signs that Sunday was a special day, she pricked up her ears to see what she could do to help. She heard Paul and Joe in a serious discussion. It seemed Joe had some excuse for not going to church which Paul was not willing to accept. Then she saw Joe with the ironing board up in the kitchen. He was doing a white shirt. "T''d be glad to iron that, if you'd like me to," Jerusha said impulsively and immediately wished she hadn't offered, for Joe was not about to let her iron his shirt any more than he was about to let her break down his wall any other way. "No, thanks," he said crisply, "Tl do all right by myself." Jerusha let the rebuff slide off as though he'd just given her a fine compliment, and turned to more fruitful fields. Suzey was fussing with a dress in the living room and looked very frustrated. Jerusha happened over and sat down beside her. "Zippers are miserable things," she said, with her eyes on the metal contraption Suzey was working on with a pair of pliers. The girl dropped the dress dejectedly. "I just can't fix it," Jerusha Spends the Night she said, almost in tears, ''and I have to have it to wear to Sunday School." Jerusha picked up the dress and looked at it critically. "Oh," she said enthusiastically, "it's still in workable order. You hold it and give me the pliers. We'll have it sliding like it had never thought of getting stuck." So, with a few tugs in the right place, the zipper glided up and down as if it were charmed. Suzey gave Jerusha a grateful smile. "Thank you," she said. But Jerusha was momentarily oblivious to the gratitude. She was appraising the long-lashed brown eyes, the chestnut hair, and the gangly legs for a certain colored new dress that would do wonders for a fast-growing young lady. Then Paul came through the house spruced up in a suit and tie. He paused, standing there tall and comely. He's right handsome, she said to herself, still fit for the races. "Joe and I are going to priesthood meeting," he said to Jerusha. "Tl be back for the family in about an hour. We'd be glad to have you go with us." Jerusha looked at him curiously. "Might as well," she said. Then, as he started to the door, she stopped him. "Just which church is this I'm about to be initiated into? I've tried several, you know. Maybe yours is different." He smiled. "Yes," he said, "I think you will find ours is different. We're Mormons." She looked at him shrewdly. "T should have known this was Mormon country," she said, and went to see what she had to wear that would be fitting for a church 115 February 1970 where you prayed for brokendown cars and a house guest that barged into your home as a highway tramp. She emerged presently, her trim little person clad in a plain dark suit, a little outmoded but neat, and her pancake hat. Amy, dressed in a ruffly hand-me-down probably from some neighbor, as it was too big, was sitting on the stool while Suzey brushed her shining curls. Jerusha caught her breath, an impulsive desire in her to get her hands in the glistening luster. "Oh, please let me do it!" she exclaimed. But Amy drew away, and Suzey looked at Jerusha apologetically. "She just won't let anybody but us be around her." "Just a slippery little fairy elf," the older woman smiled musingly, "but some day I'll catch her." Jerusha came home from Sunday School, her unruffled religious inclinations vaguely disturbed. She hadn't expected to find some deep-seated emotion inside her behaving in such a manner. True, there was a special warm atmosphere of friendliness, but there was something else, too. When Paul asked her later how she had enjoyed the services, she eyed him strangely and remarked, "Let me think about that one awhile before I answer." And now there had been two Sundays of meetings, and she. Found herself looking forward to the next one. Also, some good soul had invited her to another affair where you made quilts and one thing or another—"homemaking meeting," she called it. She had even offered to pick her up on Tuesday morning to spend the 116 day. Jerusha had quickly agreed. But Tuesday morning came along with some_ unforeseen events. "I'm going to homemaking meeting with a Mrs. Johnson," Jerusha told Suzey while they got breakfast on the table. "I'm sure you can make out all right again. There's pie left. Your father says there is some green corn ready that you could get Dennis to bring in, and maybe youd like to cook some hamburgers." Suzey was very willing. To get dinner for a day now and then was quite different from having to do it every day with no time to spend with friends or on other youthful pastimes. Before Paul left for the field, Jerusha had heard him telling Dennis to put the new calf in the pasture. "I think it is too young to give much trouble," he said, "but if you wait a day or two until he finds what his legs are for, he'll run away from you." Dennis was confiscating crumbs from the kitchen table for the birdhouse he had finished last Primary day and nailed in the sprawling willow tree at the back of the house. "Sure," he said, "T'll twist its tail if it tries to get away. If you do that, they can't get away from you." What an interesting new life! Jerusha thought—calves and birdhouses and homemaking meetings. "I saved some corn bread for your birdhouse," she said, taking a paper bag out from under the sink a little later. "Birds ought to like that." "Golly, thanks Jerusha," Dennis said with pleasureful eyes on the bag. "I wonder if it'll be a robin or a wren or just a plain old sparrow that lives in my house." "T'll bet all the birds in the neighborhood have a fight over it, and you have to hire a lawyer," Jerusha said, as Dennis took the sack and started to the door. "Don't get so excited about the lease on your property you forget about the calf." "Yeah," he said, "I'd better do it right now, 'fore I forget.'' He set the sack down and started to the barn. She had just decked herself out in a white blouse and a straight gray skirt and was pinning hairpins into her hair, when she heard a hubbub outside. Gazing through the window, she chuckled in amusement to see Dennis clinging to the tail of the red and white calf as it raced up and down along the pasture fence. "Looks to me as if it already knows what its legs are for," she said to nobody in particular. "I'd better see if I can help. Four hands on a tail ought to be better than two." But only a mere ninety-eight pounds of inexperienced woman didn't seem to amount. To much to a new calf that had just discovered the power in a_-set of fresh legs. Through some maneuvering, she did manage to grab hold, but only to find herself suddenly jerked off her feet into the weeds and dirt, wet from the water seeping under the pasture fence. After floundering about on the slippery grass and weeds, she managed to sit up just in time to see the calf, with Dennis still intact, dart through the gate amid loud bellowing from the calf and equally loud whoops from the tail twister. Jerusha Spends the Night "Well, hurrah for you," Jerusha said dryly as Dennis let go of the tail and grabbed the gate quickly before the racing young bovine made his returning lap around the pasture. "I got him!" Dennis exclaimed triumphantly, oblivious to her plight as she extricated herself from the earth and stood scooping the weeds and mud from her clothes. "Golly, you're all messed up, Jerusha. How you going to homemaking meeting?" "Now that's a good question," she remarked, as the car drove up and stopped by the newly repaired gate. "I'm so glad to have you go with me," Mrs. Johnson called, getting out of the car, and then she stopped short as she beheld her disheveled guest. "Nothing serious," Jerusha hurried to explain. "I just wasn't as tough as I thought I was. Couldn't even hang onto a calf's tail. If you'll just wait a minute, I'll see if I can find something else to wear." Homemaking meeting turned out to be most interesting. Jerusha had never quilted before, but she had done a great deal of other sewing, so that she mastered the technique quickly, and found it very delightful. There was such a warm friendly feeling around the quilt, she found herself entering freely into the conversation. She even gave a vivid description of her morning's escapade with Dennis and the calf, which brought peals of laughter. On the way home Jerusha asked abruptly, "How is it Paul Wilson never got himself a housekeeper before?" (to be continued) 117 118 Counselor Marianne C. Sharp ® Relief Society Magazine representatives continued during 1969 to maintain the high subscription rate. The total number of subscriptions has reached 281,790, with the Spanish number increasing to 6,839, making a grand total of the number of subscriptions of The Relief Society Magazine of 288,629 as of August 1, 1969. At the last Relief Society Annual General Conference in a meeting with sisters from overseas speaking different languages, the most frequently expressed request was that The Relief Society Magazine could be translated into their own languages as it was in the Spanish. It is regretted that the limited number of members in the different language groups makes it financially impossible at this time. There are 238 stakes on the Honor Roll which made 100% and over, and sixty-eight stakes in which all wards exceeded 100%. The stake with the highest percentage in 1969 is Sydney Stake, Australia. Congratulations go to these sisters who have made the high record of 196%. There are 429 stakes on the Honor Roll in 1969, which is an increase of eleven over last year. The missions are to be congratulated on having twenty-one missions on the Honor Roll. The General Board is always endeavoring to improve The Relief Society Magazine. A welcome improvement this past year is the better grade paper being used in the color sections. The colors reproduce brighter and clearer and make for more attractive reproductions. The Magazine is ably fulfilling the plans of the founders as it provides a means whereby the writing talents of Latter-day Saint women can be printed and preserved. The Magazine literary compositions in the last contests showed marked improvement in the writing fields. Through the pages of the Magazine there comes a closeness of the spirit among sisters throughout the Church. Many members today living in different lands are learning to read English. They also receive enlightenment from the pictures which carry a universal language, so that English copies which go to foreign-speaking Relief Society sisters are being utilized. May the blessings of the Lord attend the devoted Magazine representatives who carry out their callings so faithfully and the presidencies under whose direction the work progresses. 119 STAKE WARD *MISSION MISSION DISTRICT MISSION BRANCH Sydney (Australia) 196% Magazine Representative—Elsie F.

Redd Make Popsicles From Leftover Juices Alice Brady Myers @ I'm like you—practical. I save everything from the final remnant on the cutting table to the last crumbling crust of bread. My sewing cupboard is spilling out yardage scraps like the stuffing from baby Johnny's one-eared rabbit; my ball of string remains drawer-size only because of foraging kite-fliers, balloon-pullers, package-wrappers, and interior decorators; and my husband's shiny-kneed, twenty-year-old suits in the cedar closet are destined to become little suits for our small son. Everything has some useful purpose, I maintain; so you can appreciate my delight in finally discovering the answer to those almost-empty bottles of fruit juice that accumulate in the refrigerator after the fruit is gone. Like you, I had tried everything from packing the bottles tight with fruit in the beginning, to adding leftover juice to the orange juice pitcher for breakfast. Nothing was successful, and my sense of frugality was sorely tried when the family began to wonder whatever happened to the good, straightforward taste of oranges, especially considering the cost of orange juice these days. "Necessity is the mother of invention" was never more applicable than in this case. As you know, two-year-olds are, by nature, in a constant state of "necessity," and it was two-year-old Johnny's need for diversion and an after-meal snack that caused me to pour all my leftover juices into the popsicle mold for an attention-getter. Every ten minutes he dutifully tested the pregress, but, in spite of all his care, they finally did freeze. Then his satisfaction was complete. He tasted the peach one. He tasted the pear one. He tasted the cherry one. He tasted the raspberry one. Then he tasted the peach, the pear, the cherry, and the raspberry ones as nearly at once as he could. By that time his sisters were home from school, and everyone migrated to the patio to finish the tasting. Johnny and I have been in the popsicle business ever since, and I want you to know it's a relief to my conscience to have those leftover juices put to such a nourishing use. I'm like you—always happy to benefit from someone else's experience. That's why I knew you would be interested in the popsicle solution to the Juice problem. And that's why I would be glad if you could give me a little advice in return. How would you suggest I make use of some leftover bottles of juiceless cherries? (Johnny seems to have developed an uncommon appetite for cherry popsicles!) Could I make cherry pies? They are not pie cherries, you know—just nice,;-plump Bings, without their juice. 131 All material submitted for publication in this department should be sent through the stake Relief Society presidents, or mission Relief Society supervisors.

In order that more sisters might be able to have home nursing instruction we sponsored an instructor's course with the help of the Red Cross. "Twenty-three sisters were given certificates at the end of the course. During the time the course was offered, the sisters were given banquets, tours, films, and a talk from the stake president. On the final evening, a testimony meeting was held. ''Lovely floral arrangements made by members of the stake board were presented to the nursing instructors.

Doxey (Reading Assignment: Doctrine and Covenants, Section 136.) Northern Hemisphere: First Meeting, May 1970 Southern Hemisphere; First Meeting: October 1970 OBJECTIVE: The Latter-day Saint woman is guided and sustained through her knowledge that the Church has been, is, and will forever be led by prophets of the Lord. INTRODUCTION Before The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized, the Lord gave this counsel to individuals interested in Joseph Smith's work: Now, as you have asked, behold, I say unto you, keep my commandments, and seek to bring forth and establish the cause of Zion. (D&C 6:6; 12:6; 14:6.) Although Zion has -several meanings, when the foregoing counsel is considered in its context—a time when The Book of Mormon and the modern revelations had not yet been received and the Church not yet established—then Zion, as here used, refers to the marvelous work and a wonder to be established upon the earth. The marvelous and 140 wondrous work to be restored was not only The Book of Mormon spoken of by Isaiah, not only the building up of a certain geographical area, but the accomplishment of all God's purposes on the earth. (Isa. 29:13-14; D&C 105:31-32.) True it is that Zion in the scriptures refers to Jerusalem, to the ancient city of Enoch's people, to North and South America, to the center place—Jackson County, Missouri, as geographical areas. (2 Kings 19:21; Ps. 48; Moses 7:18-21; Joseph Smith, History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Vol. VI, pp. 318-19 [commonly called Documentary History of the Church; hereafter referred to as DHC}]; D&C 57:1-2.) But, also, Zion has significance in that it means: (1) The Church of Jesus Christ, and (2) the pure in heart. (D&C 105: ae; 97:21.) THE FULNESS OF TIMES Prophets saw in vision the time when God's work for man would culminate in the dispensation of Savior would come to usher in a millennial reign of peace. Might be termed 2 period in which all dispensations are gathered into one culminating period when the purposes of God for mans salvation are com leted. (Eph. 1:7-10; D&C 77:12 ) The greatness of this dispensation ls indicated in the following: __, for it is necessary in the ushering in of the dispensation of times, which dispensation is now beginning to usher in, that a whole and complete and perfect union, and welding together of dispensations, and keys, and powers, and_ glories should take place, revealed from the days of Adam even to revealed from the foundation of the world, but have been kept hid from the wise 2 prudent, shall be revealed unto babes and sucklings in this, 1 i of the fulness of times. ( Class Discussion Give an appraisal of the concept of Zion and its relationship to the dispensation of the fulness of times. THE GATHERING AND TEMPLE BUILDING One of the unique teachings of the islands of the Pacifi Lesson Department Jooked with joyful anticipation hen this gathering would take place. (Isa. 11:10-16.) (1) the Jewish people to modern Israel (D&C 133:35 (2) the ten lost tribes from the land of the north to receive their blessings at the Latter-day the Latter-day Saints. (D&C 17; 133:3.) Included in this latter group are those know? As the remnants of Jacob," the American Indian and those on c. (D&C 109:65-67.) Leaders in the salvation of those gathered are the Latter-day Saints to whom the Lord has said: Therefore, thus saith the Lord unto you, with whom the priesthood hath continued through the lawful heirs, according hid from d the priesthood have remained, and must needs lineage by the mouths of since the world began. All the holy prophets (D&C 86:8-10.) In the words of President WilI say you have your appointment, the Lord has raised UP and I can prove from the Book of Doc- February 1970 through the lineage of your fathers, and that Priesthood will continue throughout eternity, therefore you have received your appointment, and _ the Lord looks to you to build up his Zion and kingdom upon the earth. (Journal of Discourses, 18:120.) The Prophet Joseph Smith said that the main object of the gathering of the saints is to build temples. (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, pp. 307- 08.) In these sacred edifices where the Lord may come to visit his people, principles of exaltation are administered. (D&C 124:28-31, 37-42.) Thus, the purpose of all activities and programs of the Church should prepare the people for these blessings. With the keys of the gathering restored, the way was prepared for the instruction of the people in wards and stakes preparatory to their receiving the higher ordinances of the gospel. Also, the way was provided for them to administer saving ordinances for their dead. (D&C 128:5-9.) Class Discussion How are temple building and the principle of Zion related? THE CATALYST The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints exists for the purpose of bringing men to exaltation. In order that the saints may be assisted in achieving this goal, the Lord has placed within their reach the witness of the Holy Ghost to motivate them to righteousness. As the dedicated, loyal Latter-day Saint becomes acquainted with the essential purpose of the dispensation of the fulness of times— preparation for the second coming 142 of Christ—he learns that his efforts are to build Zion upon the earth. It was for the Prophet Joseph Smith, divinely directed, to restore to the earth the unique concept of Zion. From his own words we learn about Zion and the mission of the Latter-day Saints: The building up of Zion is a cause that has interested the people of God in every age; it is a theme upon which prophets, priests and kings have dwelt with peculiar delight; they have looked forward with joyful anticipation to the day in which we live; and fired with heavenly and joyful anticipations they have sung and written and prophesied of this our day; but they died without the sight; we are the favored people that God has made choice of to bring about the Latter-day glory; it is left for us to see, participate in and help to roll forward the Latter-day glory, "the dispensation of the fullness of times, when God will gather together all things that are in heaven, and all things that are upon the earth, "even in one".. - (DHC Vol. IV pp. 609-10.) United with the saints in this noble endeavor will be those of other dispensations who also worked for the accomplishment of God's purpose on the earth. As the Prophet said: The heavenly Priesthood will unite with the earthly, to bring about those great purposes; and whilst we are thus united in the one common cause, to roll forth the kingdom of God, the heavenly Priesthood are not idle spectators, the Spirit of God will be showered down from above, and it will dwell in our midst. (DHC Vol. IV, p. 610.) Class Discussion Wherein does the building of Zion contribute to preparation for the second coming of Christ? THE HOLY GHOST (HOLY SPIRIT) The Holy Ghost (Holy Spirit) is a revelator. The promise of the Lord is that his people will receive, through appointed channels, knowledge by the Holy Spirit, even that which has not been revealed since the world began. In fact, in the fulness of times nothing shall be withheld. (D&C 121:26-28.) As one views the history of the Church since its organization, the overriding conviction is that the yoice of God has been with this Church in all its travels and tribulations. (D&C 128:21.) The efforts of men to thwart the kingdom of God have been futile, although attempts have been made to destroy and to dispossess this people. (D&C 136:17.) CHALLENGE TO BUILD From the beginning of the dispensation, the Lord's servants have admonished the saints to accept the challenge of the dispensation, as given in the words of President Wilford Woodruff: We are called to build up Zion, and to establish righteousness and truth; called to build up the kingdom of God. (Journal of Discourses 12:279.) To build Zion means to participate in all the activities which will further the work of God's kingdom, his Church. (D&C 38: 40.) Whatever contribution is made to this goal is a step to the fulfillment of Zion's glory. (D&C 101:17-19.) A CENTER PLACE The early saints were given the objective of building a center place from which the wisdom of God would flow to the nations. (John Taylor, Journal of Discourses 6:169.) The temple of Lesson Department the Lord will be built in the New Jerusalem as prophesied, for therein the Lord will dwell, and righteous laws will go forth to govern the nations, as well as from the Old Jerusalem. (D&C 84:1-5; 38:21-22; Isa. 2:1-2.) In that city of Zion, to be located in Jackson County, Missouri, there shall be found peace, safety, and refuge from the wickedness of the world. In the world where strife, unrest, and war exist, Zion's people will be free from these acts of violence as they gather from the nations of the earth to serve the Lord. (D&C 45:66-75.) IN THE MEANTIME Zion as envisioned by the prophets is not here. But the preparation continues for that blessed day. Though some may not realize Zion in its fulness in this life, each saint who assumes his responsibility in building Zion will find eternal joys and happtness. He will, following the resurrection, enjoy the presence of the Lord with other faithful saints. (D&C 27:5-14.) What of the scattered saints? Members of the Church in parts of the world other than where the headquarters of the Church are found wonder when they should gather to Zion. They have already been gathered out of the world and as a covenant son or daughter of God, they must become pure in heart in order to become Zion. Zion is where the pure in heart dwell. (D&C 97:21; 101:21.) Although the saints are scattered throughout the world, as foreseen by Nephi, they are to stand in holy places (Zion) until 143 February 1970 the prophet of the Lord calls them to gather in appointed places. (1 Ne. 14:14; Elder Harold B. Lee, Conference Report, April 1948, p. 55.) The day will come when the leaders of the Church will call the faithful, devoted members to build the New Jerusalem; but the call will come only when the revelation is received by the prophet. (D&C 101:16-21; 105:13.) Class Discussion Of what necessity is it to obey the leaders of the Church? WHAT IS REQUIRED When the effort to build the center place of Zion failed in 1834, the Lord gave the reasons for the failure. He also indicated through revelation the way whereby that plan will not fail. That they themselves may be prepared, and that my people may be taught more perfectly, and have experience, and know more perfectly concerning their duty, and the things which I require at their hands. (D&C 105:10.) Class Discussion To what extent is progress being made by Latter-day Saints in attaining the objectives mentioned above? THE FUTURE OF ZION They who have the testimony of the Spirit that Joseph Smith is a true Prophet, that the revelations through him are from God, that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the only true and living Church upon the face of the earth, and that the successors of Joseph Smith have also been divinely called, know that all of the prophecies con- 144 cerning this dispensation will be fulfilled. (D&C 1:37-39.) The Lord has decreed that: (1) his kingdom is on the earth for the last time, and it will stand forever (Daniel 2:44; D&C 65:2), (2) he will raise up a people who will serve him in righteousness (D&C 100:16), and (3) Zion will be redeemed. (D&C 100:13; 136:18.) Although the future of Zion is assured, the individual member of the Church may not find the blessings of Zion except upon condition of obedience to the commandments. IMPLEMENTATION From the last revelation in the Doctrine and Covenants, given to President Brigham Young, we learn about Zion and her people: My people must be tried in all things, that they may be prepared to receive the glory that I have for them, even the glory of Zion; and he that will not bear chastisement is not worthy of my kingdom. (D&C 136:31.) The trials of present-day saints compared with those of members in the decades following the organization of the Church may be quite different, yet the basis for faith and devotion remains the same. President Heber C. Kimball once said: Let me say to you, that many of you will see the time when you will have all the trouble, trial and persecution that you can stand, and plenty of opportunities to show that you are true to God and his work. This Church has before it many close places through which it will have to pass before the work of God is crowned with victory. To meet the difficulties that are coming, it will be necessary for you to have a knowledge of the truth of this work for yourselves. The difficulties will be of such a charac- ter that the man or woman who does not possess this personal knowledge or witness will fall. If you have not got the testimony, live right and call upon the Lord and cease not till you obtain it. If you do not you will not stand. Remember these sayings, for many of you will live to see them fulfilled. The time will come when no man nor woman will be able to endure on borrowed light. Each will have to be guided by the light within himself. If you do not have it, how can you stand? Do you believe it? (Life of Heber C. Kimball, by Orson F. Whitney, pp. 449-50.) If the saints failed to observe the words of the Lord, the kingdoms of the world would prevail against them, for they were assigned to be a light to the world. (D&C 103:5-13.) Ample provision has been made whereby the saint may learn his duties from attendance at appointed meetings, study of the scriptures, and by the Holy Ghost as an interpreter and guide to truth. Although one may follow these ways of determining truth, yet there is one sure and practical way to keep on the Lord's side. Expressed in the words of the Prophet Joseph Smith, it is: "Look to the Presidency and receive Lesson Department instruction." (DHC 3:391; D&C 124:45-46.) The First Presidency of the Church teach only the way of righteousness whereby exaltation will come to those who obey. The revelations of the Lord come to them for the members of the Church. They are inspired to solve the problems of the day and to give the correct interpretation of what the Lord has revealed in the books of scripture. The Lord has said through the Prophet Joseph Smith concerning the goal for which the saints should strive: And your whole labor shall be in Zion, with all your soul, from henceforth; yea, you shall ever open your mouth in my cause, not fearing what man can do, for I am with you. Amen. (D&C 30:11.) We ought to have the building up of Zion as our greatest object (Joseph Smith, DHC 3:390.) If one accepts this charge, then he will accept in deed the closing words of the Doctrine and Covenants: Be diligent in keeping all my commandments, lest judgments come upon you, and your faith fail you, and your enemies triumph over you. So no more at present. Amen and Amen. (D&C 136: 42.) °, o° "THE FLOWER SONG WHEN THE SUN IS OUT" (Words of Small John Grenawalt) The rain slid down on the world outside, On trees and the silver street, Inside, the tune that my grandson played Was lilting and strangely sweet.

Brown ° 145 VISITING TEACHER MESSAGE — Truths to Live By (Correlated With the Family Home Evening Manual, 1969-70) Message 8—''Men Are, That They Might Have Joy'' (2 Ne. 2:25.) Alice Colton Smith Northern Hemisphere: First Week, May 1970 Southern Hemisphere: First Week, October 1970 OBJECTIVE: To remember that one of God's great objectives is that man "might have joy. It was her first week in an eastern city. She, a girl from the western United States, was attending the biggest junior high school she had ever seen. Uncertain, shy, and frightened, she tried to make herself as inconspicuous as possible. It was Friday morning and the long week was coming to a close. Horrified she heard the teacher call her name to come to the front of the class and lead it in reading the scriptures and the morning prayer. Fortunately, unlike today, simple _ religious services were allowed in the schools. The walk to the front of the room seemed endless. She felt every eye staring at her. Without looking up, she opened the Bible with stiff fingers. What should she read? What could she read? A moment of fumbling and there in front of her were the reassuring words, the comforting, beloved words read so often at home. It was her favorite Psalm. Too young yet to understand completely their full meaning, the beautiful words were even so an anchor in the storm: 146 I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth. He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber. Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul. The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore. (Ps. 121.) As she read the familiar, beloved lines, fright left her. The Lord was her strength and refuge. Out of panic came comfort and joy. '"".. Men are, that they might have joy." (2 Ne. 2:25.) In a world where uncertainty, fear, and evil are common these words are indeed welcome. The earth was created to make joy possible. Strange as it seems, to accomplish this purpose of God man must be enticed by both good and evil to make choice real. He must learn the law and the consequences of choice. When men were redeemed from the fall this joy became possible because they became "... Free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon." (2 Ne. 2: 26.) What did Lehi mean by "free forever" and "to act for themselves and not to be acted upon'? How do these concepts contribute to joy? What is joy? How do we acquire it? There is much discussion of joy in the scriptures. As King Benjamin gave his last great address to the Nephites they were " filled with joy, having received a remission of their sins, and having peace of conscience, because Lesson Department of the exceeding faith which they had in Jesus Christ who should come. " (Mosiah 4:3.) For the Lord shall comfort Zion, he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the Lord. Joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving and the voice of melody. (2 Ne. 8:3.) God's desire is that we will know joy, and we experience it many times in life when we are doing his will, but we must remember, "Wherefore, fear not even unto death; for in this world your joy is not full, but in me your joy is full." (D&C 101:36.) HOMEMAKING—Development Through Homemaking Education Woman's Role in Family Preparedness Discussion 8—''She Stretcheth Out Her Hand to the Poor; Yea, She Reacheth Forth Her Hands to the Needy."' (Prov. 31:20.) Celestia J. Taylor Northern Hemisphere: Second Meeting, May 1970 Southern Hemisphere: Second Meeting, October 1970 OBJECTIVE: To show that compassionate service is part of each woman's role in the welfare program. INTRODUCTION The word "compassion" is a Christ-like term and one closely associated with the Savior in his brief span of life upon the earth. It is deeply rooted in the second great commandment, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself' (Matt. 22:39) and in the golden rule which is closely related to it, "Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them " (Matt. 7:12.) The word takes on added meaning when we couple it with another highly connotative term, and we say "compassionate service," a phrase 147 February 1970 beautifully poetic in its fusion of sound and sense. This phrase is indivisibly connected to Relief Society and therefore to the Latter-day Saint woman. Love-inspired compassionate service is the thing for which Relief Society is best known and... Respected. Sympathetic, tender, merciful service to those in distress is, and always has been, the fundamental work of Relief Society. The relief of the poor, the destitute, the widow, and the orphan; ministrations to the sick and downtrodden; comfort to the sorrowing and to those whose souls are weary; and the exercise of benevolence are the principal purposes for which Relief Society was organized. (History of Relief Society, p. 61.) THE WOMAN'S ROLE DEFINED Since the organization of Relief Society in 1842, Latter-day Saint women have been fulfilling these purposes and have attached to themselves as their motto, "Charity never faileth." In the words of President Spafford,... Charity is the expression of unselfish love which builds up = and strengthens not only the physical but the spiritual in our people and helps the individual and the family to realize their full potentials. (From an address in Welfare Meeting, held April 7, 1967.) Today, the welfare program encompasses far more' than merely taking care of the physical needs of our people. It embraces many activities which have to do with the rehabilitation of the soul and spirit as well. The admonition which the Prophet Joseph Smith gave to the sisters in the early days of the Church that they " might provoke the brethren to good works in looking to the wants of the poor—searching after objects of charity, and in administering to their wants." 148 (History of Relief Society, p. 18), are just as pertinent today as they were then. As women of the Church we need to recognize our individual part in this great program and fulfill the role which is assigned to us. PUTTING OUR OWN HOUSES IN ORDER Ourrecent homemaking discussions have pointed out our responsibilities in preparing our own homes and families to be selfsustaining. When we extend our own houses to include any close relatives or family connections who might be in need, we are giving "compassionate service" to our own and to that extent are aiding the welfare program even though it may not be given credit as Relief Society compassionate service. When we extend such service to a needy neighbor or friend, we contribute even more compassionate service. HELPING OUR WARD FAMILY As sisters in Relief Society, one of our responsibilities is to devote whatever time we can in caring for the sick and the needy in our ward family. When such help is needed, we may assist them in learning to sew and cook and develop their abilities in all the homemaking arts by urging their attendance at Relief Society homemaking meetings, as well as by giving them special help in their own homes. In addition: We can render compassionate service in times of sorrow and bereavement by assisting in whatever ways our help might be needed. We can extend the hand of friendship to those who are lonely and in need of comfort. We can visit the homebound and cheer their spirits by reading to them and by administering to their needs in other ways. We can give nursing care and special assistance when called by our Relief Society president or by the bishop, as the case may be. Those of us who are trained in special ways can provide such help as tutoring services for backward children or for "dropouts" who need special guidance, opening our homes to the Indian children who need companionship and training, giving volunteer service wherever the need arises. We will benefit threefold by giving of ourselves in compasslonate service, for as the poet Lowell says, "Who gives himself with his alms feeds three, Himself, his hungering neighbor, and me." (James R. Lowell, Lowell's Complete Poems, [Boston and New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1899], p. 111.) Lesson Department CONCLUSION The world today is sorely in need of the administering services of love and compassion which stem only from the human heart. Women are by nature loving and compassionate. The Prophet Joseph Smith recognized these womanly virtues and pronounced a wonderful blessing upon the heads of the sisters if they would act accordingly. This is a charitable Society, and according to your natures; it is natural for females to have feelings of charity and benevolence... If you live up to your privileges, the angels cannot be _ restrained from being your associates. (Joseph Smith, History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Vol. IV, p. 605 [commonly called Documentary History of the Church].) SOCIAL RELATIONS—Immortality and Eternal Life 4 Lesson 8—''Whither Goest Thou?'' Alberta H. Christensen (Reference: Immortality and Eternal Life, Vol. 2, Selections from the Writings and Messages of President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., Melchizedek Priesthood Course of Study, 1969-70, Lesson 39 and other lessons as specified.) Northern Hemisphere: Third Meeting, May 1970 Southern Hemisphere: Third Meeting, October 1970 OBJECTIVE: To reemphasize some of the truths in the writings of President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., which may influence for good the behavior patterns of our lives. INTRODUCTION A man may be remembered for his deeds and also for his words, each being an indicator of his general pattern of thinking. Thus a man may exert an influence upon others long after he himself has left the mortal scene. 149 February 1970 President J. Rueben Clark, Jr. Is remembered for many accomplishments contributed during a long and active lfe but he also is remembered by his words. The present series of social relations lessons, based upon his writings and orally given addresses, have brought us the benefit of his thinking on many aspects of life. In lesson 1, titled "Profiles Remembered" reference was made as to his continuing influence upon some policies of international law. That which President Clark contributed during his many years of service to the Church may likewise have a continuing effect for good as his administrative counsel is remembered and retained. In addresses given at the Relief Society Annual General Conferences to the women of the Church, to other Church auxiliary organizations, in baccalaureate sermons given to graduating university students, and on other occasions, President Clark made many important statements. ) To isolate specific comments from their original context, often robs them of important associated meanings, yet there are many statements, uniquely and concisely expressed, which may stand alone. As pronouncements of truth or opinion, they may stimulate personal thought or form the basis for intelligent and profitable discussion. They even may vitalize an individual's life. In the latter part of this lesson we include a number of important statements made by President Clark. They reflect the thinking of a good and great man upon the basic principles of 150 the gospel and upon many aspects of our everyday lives. As lesson 1 "Profiles Remembered" (The Relief Society MagazinesJuly 1968, p. 544) summarizes, generally, the important accomplishments of President Clark's active life, this lesson reemphasizes_ the spiritual and intellectual aspects of his personality as revealed through his writings. Together, they personalize a well-balanced and deeply religious man, who may continue to inspire and motivate others for good. WHITHER GOEST THOU? President Clark, in lesson 39 of the Melchizedek Priesthood course of study, brings us face to face with the essential problem of individual choice as to the direction we wish our lives to take. He reminds us of the results of the choices we choose to make. Through relevant scripture he takes us to the upper chamber at the Last Supper, when Jesus told his disciples: Little children, yet a little while I am with you. (John 13:33.) Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards. (John 13:36.) President Clark then refers to a tradition which, although not supported by recorded facts of history, is an impressive story. It states that: Peter, the Apostle, bitterly persecuted, was fleeing Rome for his life. He had hardly gotten outside the city walls when he met the Savior coming along the Appian Way, going towards Rome. Startled, Peter cried out, "Quo vadis, domine?" "Master, whither goest thou?" The Savior answered, "I am going to Rome to be crucified again,' and vanished. Reproved, conscience stricken humbled, Peter turned about and went back and his crucifixion, head downwards at his own request, declaring himself unworthy to die as had the Master. (Dictionary of the Apostolic Church, sub voce "Peter.") The Apostolic Church was not built the humble ones of God's footstool who found the gospel so plain and simple that they could understand it, live it, and die for it. From the beginning until now the Lord has pointed the way to his service, not always so dramatically as in this tradition about Peter, but he has never left us without a living or written guide. If we shall gain the destiny God has prepared for us, we must have that same spirit of sacrifice which is thus traditioned of Peter. (Immortality and Eternal Life, Vol. 2, lesson 39.) Class Participation Questions 1. Do you ever ask yourself, "Where do I want to be in eternity?" 9. Where am I at present, on that road? President Clark states: « each of you may 8° spiritually where he wants to go, for each of you may choose your spiritual destination, the Lord having endowed each of us with that right and that power." (Ibid.) 3. What does President Clark mean by "endowed by that right and that power?" There is an old saying, "All roads lead to Rome" and some apply it to mean that all roads lead to heaven, inferring that specific beliefs and religious principles do not really matter. 4. Do you believe the foregoing statement? If not, why? What do you believe? NO ROYAL ROAD There is no royal road to salvation and exaltation. It is a road beset with trials and tribulations and temptations even from the beginning to the end. Temptation will never cease while you are mortal. Never forget that. (Immortality and Eternal Life, Vol. 2, lesson 34.) Lesson Department With the foregoing in mind, Latter-day Saint women will want to embrace all that motivates for good, all that will light the way beyond the trial and the temptations. In the writings of President Clark there are many guidelines for righteous, happy living. Some of them embody vital spiritual truths, which, when understood and lived, may change for good the behavior pattern of our lives. A number of guideline comments appear in this lesson. Unless otherwise indicated, these statements are selected from President Clark's writings which constitute the Melchizedek Priesthood course of study for 1969-70. Choose for class discussion—as time will permit—those which may be of special interest to the group. The numbers refer to the numbers of the lessons in Immortality and Eternal Life, Vol. 2. (See Lesson Helps as to the development of this lesson.) Lesson 1: Our Homes To the Latter-day Saint, the home is a holy place. It has its pattern in the heavens. The priesthood-born home is. The joftiest spiritual organism of which we know. Only through it can the highest exaltation come. Lesson 2: The Building of Home Life What must i divine destiny be to become the celestial family of infinity. - a welcome; motherhood and fatherhood bring the highest happiness and are our loftiest destiny. Lesson 3: Our Wives and Our Mothers in the Eternal Plan From that day, when Eve thus placed first among her blessings the power to bear children, the greatest glory of true womanhood has been motherhood. 151 February 1970 Lesson 4: Responsibilities Attending Homemaking God grant we may in this nation, and in the world, rebuild, fortify, and keep forever safe, the true Christian home. Lesson 5: Children in the Gospel Plan Knowledge plants the seed; wisdom garners the harvest. Knowledge is the race of the swift, the battle of the strong; wisdom is that which endureth to the end. Knowledge like the wind goeth where it listeth; wisdom braves the blast and goeth down the middle of the road. Knowledge telleth the hours of the sun's coming up and going down; wisdom putteth the hours to the service of man. Knowledge telleth the time for sowing and for reaping; wisdom planneth wisely and nurseth the crop to ripeness. Knowledge counts the virtues and marks out their boundaries; wisdom brings them all together to make the upright man. (Addressed to officers and teachers): Those who undertake to instruct, guide, and direct the children and the youth of Zion, in whatever capacity or institution, work not in a worldly career, but in a sacred calling... Teachers must come to their tasks praying, with pure hearts, upright lives, contrite spirits. Lesson 7: Restraints and Conventions —Why? It follows that whether we wish or whether we do not wish restraint, yet restraint is inherent in all creation: it has endured in the past, it will exist in the future. Lesson 20: Seek Not After Earthly Treasures Remember that when the Savior was here and bestowed the blessings, which he, the Divine One, had to give, in no case did he give riches. He gave health, he gave strength, he restored sight, he made the dumb to speak, he pardoned sin, he led people from sin. The one thing that he did not do was to give of earthly riches. Lesson 21: Life at Its Best The Lord always speaks to a people 152 in the language which they speak and in terms which they understand. Lesson 22: The Upward Reach The Church is the organization which God has set up to help men in their struggles against the limitations and inhibitions of the flesh... It is as nearly perfect as mortals permit it to be; greater perfection will come just as soon as men can understand and use it. The Lord has never revealed his mind and will beyond man's power of comprehension; and when man has shown his confirmed unwillingness to follow the plan and live the law revealed, the Lord has taken each away and given a less perfect plan and lower law, as he did to Israel under Moses. Lesson 23: Work—Work Always Work is next to genius. You cannot be successful at anything and waste your time. Lesson 25: Divine Origin of the Welfare Program men who want to rationalize, judge everything by their own wisdom. Lesson 26: Sacrifice and Service It is perfectly idle for us to try to understand all of the works of the Lord, all of the reasons for what he tells us to do; some we can get dimly but we cannot understand all. Lesson 28: Beware of False Prophets It is a dangerous thing to tamper with the words and revelations of the Lord, by way of adding to or taking away. Who is so wise as to say which of God's commands may be ignored, or altered, or cast away? Lesson 31: Knowing the Scriptures I cannot impress... Too much the importance of reading the scriptures and of trying to learn their meaning. They are told to us in clear enough language so that we can always be reasonably certain when we are in the true paths. Lesson 35: Get your own Testimony... Seek a testimony, humbly; live for it and God will give it to you. And when you get it, do not be boastful, but be humble; because if you boast, it may leave you.... Humility is necessary to the full enjoyment of the Spirit of the Lord. Lesson 37: Prayer Prayer is the royal road between each of us and our Heavenly Father. Whether it remains open or is closed is for our determination. I think there is no common denominator for all the peoples of the world that can equal the desire to pray and the resulting prayers. We do not all pray alike. We do not all pray to the same God... But the commonest instinct of all humanity is to pray to a superior Being, some Being somewhere, of some kind, who knows more than we know and who has the power to change events to suit our prayers if he so desires. Lesson 44: What is Man We are not moving blindly... Guided only by the revelations given in ancient times. We are moving forward under revelations given in modern times and... A knowledge that if we need further light, it shall be given to us. Lesson 35: Not Where You Serve, But How In the service of the Lord, it is not where you serve but how. (Immortality and Eternal Life, Vol. 1, 1968-69.) THE MAN REMEMBERED—A SUMMARY Although we now conclude our present lesson-association with President Clark, we do not part company with him as an individual, nor with his guiding words. He has become a wise and friendly counselor, leading us kindly to the core of Christ's teachings, urging us to make the Scriptures a practical part of our everyday lives. He has introduced us to the universe, sometimes along paths of logic too profound for all to follow easily, but well worth the intellectual effort needed to understand even its basic immutable laws. He has helped us to see that liberty is not license, and that responsibilities accompany freedom, warning us to be Lesson Department vigilant against the conspiracies of evil. He has enlisted our loyalty to our families, our friends, and to the Church, even loyalty to the responsibilities of our day-to-day living. His appreciation for the role of woman gives many wives and mothers a new perspective of worth and importance in the eternal plan of life, thus bringing to brighter flame the lhght of unity and love which should glow in every home. He asks us to work, and to pray for wisdom, and to weigh prudently the luxury desires of the present against the lasting joy of the eternity, reminding us that there is no profit in gaining the whole world if one loses his own soul. Although himself steadfast in his adherence to principle, he speaks with compassion and understanding of the weak who are struggling to overcome error and to live a better life. Over and over again he reminds us that humility is essential for all who would grow in mind and in faith, essential for all who would enjoy the companionship of the Holy Spirit. Time and time again he has given us his testimony that Jesus of Nazareth is Christ, the Redeemer, warning us not to be deceived by false doctrine and philosophies of men. Relief Society sisters, this is the legacy President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. Has left to help us as we walk the road toward immortality and eternal life.

Thomas Textbook: Out of the Best Books, Volume 5 Community Responsibility, Section Seven By Bruce B. Clark and Robert K. Thomas 'Action may not always bring happiness, but there is no happiness without action." —Benjamin Disraeli Northern Hemisphere: Fourth Meeting, May 1970. Southern Hemisphere: Fourth Meeting, September 1970 OBJECTIVE: To show that no view from without can match the insight, growth, and accomplishment of involvement. MUSIC "Fourth Tableau" from the ballet Petrushka by Igor Stravinsky (1882. ) American (Russian-born) Commentary on musical selection by Clawson Cannon, Assistant Dean of College of Fine Arts, Brigham Young University. When a person is asked to "participate in a piece of music," too often he thinks he is to take up violin and bow, to limber up his pianistic fingers, to clear his throat with a few "'a-hems" to be ready to make music with others. Actually, whenever a this cogent definition: "By the 'listener,' | do not mean the person who simply hears INTRODUCTION TO LITERATURE Lesson that people today _ are bigger, stronger, and healthier than their Despite reassuring statistics forebears, many have the dis- 154 quieting feeling that individuals have never counted for less. Overwhelmed by a technology which makes the individual seem slow and awkward and conditioned by the evidence of human folly with which the mass communications media engulfs him, modern man may have a difficult time remembering that he is in the image of God and has an infinite potential. Increased specialization at work may focus his attention on the part so completely that he loses awareness of the whole. Bombarded by advertisements which proclaim the necessity to remain youthful, he faces his advancing years with trepidation. In sum, his personal contribution may appear to be so insignificant that it does not seem worthwhile to participate at all. "THE OVEN BIRD" To such an individual Robert Frost's "The Oven Bird" has a realistic message. The final line of the poem "... What to make of a diminished thing" suggests that we prepare for the diminution we must all face. This is most obvious when our physical powers begin to fail but is probably even more disquieting when we begin to have trouble remembering or find it taxing to follow complicated directions. The seasons do follow one another, and with changing circumstance there is loss. Yet, however "diminished" our powers or our situation, there is still opportunity. Not only is ability to adapt one of the most valid tests of intelligence, it is also a clear indication of what we have Lesson Department learned. It is depressing to meet a person who, supposedly, has had ten years' experience in a position only to find out that he really has had one year's experience repeated ten times. It is worthy of note that Frost's symbolic bird has an insistent, almost unexpected, song as though he first had to convince himself. He is not ''as other birds." His is not a conventional, graceful melody that might suggest acceptance. Perhaps the key to this poem is the word "make" in the last line. If we wait for opportunity to knock, we may be making unrealistic assumptions about our hearing, but if we take what we have, look at it freshly, and are determined to make something exciting out of it, we _cannot fail. Question for Discussion In Frost's '"The Oven Bird" why are the echoes of the Biblical "fall'' so appropriate? "LIFE"' George Herbert's "Life" has a similar message, but it adds an explicit religious dimension: I made a posy, while the day ran by: Here will I smell my remnant out, and tie My life within this band. But Time did beckon to the flowers, and they By noon most cunningly did steal away, And withered in my hand. My hand was next to them, and then my heart: I took, without more thinking, in good part Time's gentle admonition: Who did so sweetly death's sad taste convey, Making my mind to smell my fatal day; Yet sugaring the suspicion. 155 February 1970 Farewell dear flowers, sweetly your time ye spent, Fit, while ye lived, for smell or ornament, And after death for cures. I follow straight without complaints or grief, Since if my scent be good, I care not if It be as short as yours. Herbert's use of a bouquet of flowers to symbolize his days is an attractive one and, considering his blameless life, appropriate. Yet by "noon," or middle age, they have already started to wilt. In reflecting on this, he is grateful that he has been reminded of his mortality so gently. The scent of lovely flowers may fade, but if they were fragrant and beautiful while they were fresh and can be turned into healing medicine after they have been dried, Herbert is content to accept them as an image of what he would like his own life to be. Herbert's poetry shows the influence of John Donne but his verses are more artistically constructed than Donne's. Herbert's work lacks the fire that we associate with much religious poetry, but he lets us see the appealing serenity which a mind and life in accord with Christian principles can produce. Question for Discussion What is Herbert probably suggesting when, in the last stanza of his poem, he says he will "follow straight" the example set by flowers? "KEEPING MENTALLY ALIVE" BY HARRY ALLEN OVERSTREET "Keeping Mentally Alive" has a style to match its message. The opening dialogue is almost breezy but it sets the tone for what Overstreet has to say. We tend to 156 identify with the dramatic elements of any dialogue; it is hard not to feel at least partially involved when there is a conversation going on in your presence, and Overstreet hopes to continue a mood of informal discussion after the actual dialogue is over. What is called "mental fixity" in this article is essentially an attitude. For example, if we have a negative, pre-determined concept of what a visiting teacher does, we may be reluctant to accept an assignment that we have defined as insignificant. If, however, we bring our freshest and most creative thinking to the calling of a visiting teacher, we will catch the spirit of this uniquely sisterly opportunity. In such receptivity, we will keep within the general guidelines of our call while infusing it with imagination, and we will find it thrilling. Question for Discussion Although Overstreet. Seems to emphasize accepting the new, how can we remain "mentally alive" in considering that which is old? FROM "GREAT POSSESSIONS" BY DAVID GRAYSON "David Grayson" was the pen name of Ray Stannard Baker (1870-1946). His talents were many. As a journalist he gained the reputation of being America's foremost reporter. As a writer for the periodicals of his day, he contributed over two hundred articles to leading magazines, including one on "The Vitality of Mormonism" for Century Magazine during 1904. As champion of Woodrow Wilson, he won a Pulitzer Prize for his eight-volume work, Woodrow Wilson: Life and Letters. In a very real sense, Baker, the journalist and public servant, turned into "David Grayson," the appreciator of life. The excerpt from Great Possessions, which we have included in our text, is typical of "Grayson" apreciation, for he stressed simplicity, sensitivity, and involvement. Where earlier selections have emphasized participation that reflected adaptability, living fully, and mental vitality, these lines stress one's relationship to his immediate environment. Horace is a captive of his farm. His interests and concerns are bounded by it in the most obvious sense. David cannot resist pointing out that so limited a vision is not even totally successful in mateLesson Department New Magazine Binding Prices and Postage Rates A sure way of keeping alive the valuable instruction of each month's Relief Society Magazine is in a handsomely bound cover.

Perhaps the most memorable point in this selection is Baker's contention that one can be both practical and aesthetically sensitive. Both mind and body thrive when they are brought into a full, complementary relationship. Question for Discussion How might Grayson in_ Great Possessions have interested Horace in values which are not explicitly material? "STOPPING BY WOODS ON A SNOWY EVENING" BY ROBERT FROST "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening" may now be among the best. Known poems ever written in America. It is appealing to both the critics and the public at large; to both children and adults. It tells of a driver and his horse stopping in | the woods during an evening snowfall. Distracted by the "dark and deep" loveliness of the scene, the driver would linger for a moment to "watch the woods fill up with snow"; but the little horse, in his impatience to be on his way, "gives his harness bells a shake" and the driver is reminded of promises he must keep and that there are still "miles to go" before he can sleep. Among the meanings this short lyric suggests is that it costs effort to become a responsible person—there is a pull that would take us from the "promises" we have made and the moral commitment that keeps us involved in what we know we should do.

"THE CANTERBURY PILGRIMS" Our final selection, Hawthorne's "The Canterbury Pilgrims" presents us with several characters who have not found their participation in life to be very rewarding. The artist has been blocked from meaningful involvement with others by his own ego; the ruined financier has stumbled over things; the older couple have let themselves become victimized by circumstance. Sadly, not one of them is prepared to change. The young Shaker couple, still on the threshold of worldly experience, must face the fact that their lives and their marriage may prove as unsatisfying as those that they have just heard recounted. Yet they move out into the world with sober confidence. Failure may be a real possibility, but refusal to act ls to deny all chance of success Or happiness. Question for Discussion Why might the young Shaker couple in "The Canterbury Pilgrims" be successful when the others, to whom they listened, have failed?
