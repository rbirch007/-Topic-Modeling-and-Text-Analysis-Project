JANUARY 1967 2 \ -,. | ad "s ' 'we at, § The word which characterizes the New Year is the word happy. "Happy New Year" rings out in joyous sound. Similar expressions are found in different languages in different countries. They contemplate the past year with its sunlight and shadows and wish for a new year of happiness. This wish is extended by the General Board to every Relief Society member in the year 1967. As we extend this wish to you, we are mindful of the words of the Prophet Joseph Smith: Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it; and this path is virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God. But we cannot expect to know all, or more than we now know unless we comply with or keep those we have already received (DHC V:134-135). Each one to whom we offer this wish lives under different economic, social, and physical conditions, but each one has one great spiritual blessing. You each have the good tidings of great joy. You each have this blueprint for happiness. You each have the divine gift of a loving Heavenly Father to you his beloved daughter—The Relief Society. Relief Society will assist you wondrously on your twelvemonth pilgrimage on the path for happiness. As you persist, your burdens will drop from you. To each Relief Society member we send this message of love—"'Happy New Year!"

The Role of Women in Building the Kingdom Elder Harold B. Lee Of the Council of the Twelve [Address Delivered at the Stake Board Session of the Relief Society Annual General Conference, September 29, 1966] w I would not have you think that my coming in late and not being able to hear my esteemed and beloved friend and brother, Gordon B. Hinckley of the Council of the Twelve, indicated any lack of respect. I would have wished to have been here. I know his great power of uplift; and I would have felt happy had I been here to have received it; and, also, it would relieve me of an anxiety that I might be repeating what he may have said to you already in this session. Before, or shortly after I became a member of the Council of the Twelve, I was called to the office of the President of the Church, and he said, ""We have Brother Callis and Brother Cannon who are the Advisers to the Primary, and we have been thinking we need someone near the age of the Primary children as an Adviser."' You can imagine my anxiety when I was told about about two years ago that I was being relieved of that responsibility and was now being made an Adviser to the Relief Society. I don't know whether that has any significance or not, but at least it gave me a rather queer feeling. Before I accepted this responsibility, I gave Sister Spafford a rather negative or evasive answer. I had some other commitments that I thought might prevent my being here at this time, but after a little deliberation and a little shifting, she was called and was told that I would be able to accept the assignment. She replied, "Well, that's fine because his name is already on the program." Now that's how we get assignments from Sister Spaf- The Role of Women in Building the Kingdom ford. I thought you would be interested to know. I want to say to you that those of us who work closely with Sister Spafford and these counselors in welfare work, for more than thirty years as a matter of fact; Beehive Clothing Mills with the intricacies and the _ problems which you all know are tremendous as you meet the problems out in your wards and stakes; with the Correlation Committee; and the Advisory Board, which includes the heads of all auxiljaries and the Priesthood; and now as Adviser to Relief Society; and besides having the opportunity to have traversed some of the territory where President Spafford has gone and meeting women of renown from all countries, I want to say to you with all sincerity and with no attempt to "gild the lily," that I think we have had few women among us who have attained the worldwide stature and is so recognized as a power for good among the women of the earth as we have today in Sister Belle S. Spafford. If you knew what I know you'd know that I wasn't overshooting the mark by that statement. I have been asked to speak on a particular subject, broad enough, I'm sure, that a series of talks would not be sufficient to exhaust the possibilities— "The Role of Women in Building the Kingdom." So I shall narrow what I say about this subject under four different headings, and then make a few conclusions so that, if you care to, you can bring it all together and add to it as many others as you wish. The Lord declares what his work and glory is. To Moses, he said, "For behold, this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). Since that profound declaration of Mother Eve in the Garden of Eden after the Fall, the exalted place of women in the plan of salvation was clearly defined. These words that I will quote to you now are said by students of the scriptures to be the greatest short sermon ever delivered, delivered by a woman. Now note what she says:.. Were it not for our transgression we never should have had seed, and never should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient (Moses 5:11). Lehi explains and amplifies what Mother Eve said, when, apparently, his son Jacob asked for an explanation of the Fall and why evil was permitted in the world. Lehi made this explanation: And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen, but he would have remained in the garden of Eden. And all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created; and they must have remained forever, and had no end. And they would have had no children; wherefore they would have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin. But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things. Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy (2 Nephi 2: 22-25). January 1967 If immortality, then, is the first step in the achievement of the Lord's work and his glory, it is readily to be understood that the process by which immortality is achieved is through the bearing of mortal offspring by mortal mothers in holy wedlock and sired by mortal fathers. Woman's role in God's eternal plan of salvation has here, then, been reaffirmed. Will you think of this, in this day of mass hysteria over birth control by artificial means? It might be well for Relief Society mothers to consider the role of woman in the great plan of salvation as the Lord has explained it. The woman's role involves a partnership, hopefully with a noble son of God. It was the apostle Paul who declared this interdependence between men and women to be achieved only in holy wedlock. Here are a few of his quotations: ''Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord. For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God" (I Cor. 11: 11-12). "... But the woman is the glory of the man" (I Cor. 11: 7). "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it.. So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself" (Eph. 5:25, 28). "For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh" (Matt. 19:5). The sacred nature of this partnership is nowhere better explained than by our own Pres- 6 ident David O. McKay, and is now quoted in our 1966 Melchizedek Priesthood Manual, if you want to check this when you get home, page 63. This is what we're teaching your husbands in their weekly Priesthood meetings. I read this to my wife and she commented, "'But why don't you teach this to the Priesthood rather than to the sisters?" Well, we want the sisters to know what their husbands are being taught, and if their husbands are not going to Priesthood meeting, they will see that they get there to hear these lessons taught in Priesthood meeting. Now this is what the President said, and you can understand what my wife meant: "Love is the highest attribute of the human soul, and fidelity is love's noblest offspring." Most, if not all, of the virtues are the natural fruit of genuine love. President McKay has given inspired counsel regarding the physical dimension of the love relationship between a man and his wife. He said: "Let us instruct young people who come to us to know that a woman should be queen of her own body "Second, let them remember that gentleness and consideration after the ceremony are just as appropriate and necessary and beautiful as gentleness and consideration before the wedding.. Chastity is the crown of beautiful womanhood, and self-control is the source of true manhood, if you will know it, not indulgence... "Let us teach our young men to enter into matrimony with the idea that each will be just as courteous and considerate of a wife after the ceremony as during courtship" (Melchidezek Priesthood Manual 1966, page 63). Now you have companion lessons to these in the Relief So- The Role of Women in Building the Kingdom ciety, don't you see? And you, having been schooled in the Relief Society, your husbands receiving this kind of a lesson in the Priesthood, the meeting of the two lessons~brings an ideal Home Evening lesson, where father and mother, with their growing-up sons and daughters, are taught these fundamental principles. The curse of infidelity is plainly set forth also by President McKay in this same Priesthood manual that I'm talking about. He says: As teachers, we are to let the people know, and warn these men - and this is not imagination - who, after having lived with their wives and brought into this world four or five children, get tired of them and seek a divorce, that they are on the road to hell (Ibid., pp. 638, 64). That comforts me a little, because I quoted something to a certain lovely sister who was having trouble with her husband, that no woman was expected to follow her husband to hell, and I am reinforced when President McKay made this statement: It is unfair to a woman to leave her that way, merely because the man happens to fall in love with some younger woman and feels that the wife is not so beautiful or attractive as she used to be. Warn him! Nothing but unhappiness for him and injustice to those children can result (JIbid., page 64). I saw what I think was the pinnacle of understanding in this respect when the president of the American Medical Association was here to give an address before our Utah Association. They, the auxiliary to the Utah Association, had arranged for some entertainment for his wife, but she became ill and could not accompany him, and the sisters, of course, were very disappointed, and one of them asked him, "Is your wife just as beautiful as she always was to you?" And he answered, "Yes, just as beautiful, but it does take her a little more time." Sometimes as we go throughout the Church we hear a husband and wife who come to us and ask that because they are not compatible in their marriage, they having had a temple marriage, wouldn't it be better if they were to free themselves from each other and then seek more congenial partners? And to all such we say, whenever we find a couple who have been married in the temple who say they are tiring of each other, it is an evidence that either one or both are not true to their temple covenants. Any couple married in the temple who are true to their covenants will grow dearer to each other, and love will find a deeper meaning on their golden wedding anniversary than on the day they were married in the house of the Lord. Now don't you mistake that. The duties and purposes of the Relief Society in this regard have found expression from one of the Presidents of the Church, President Joseph F. Smith, in which he emphasizes another phase of the woman's role as a member of the Relief Society. Now I have spoken of the one phase as a creator in company with her husband. Now note what President Joseph F. Smith says: I will speak of the Relief Society as one great organization in the Church, organized by the Prophet 7 January 1967 Joseph Smith, whose duty it is to look after the interests of all the women of Zion and of all the women that may come under their supervision and care, irrespective of religion, color or condition. I expect to see the day when this organization will be one of the most perfect, most efficient and effective organizations for good in the Church but that day will be when we shall have women who are not only imbued with the spirit of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and with the testimony of Christ in their hearts, but also with youth, vigor and intelligence to enable them to discharge the great duties and responsibilities that rest upon them. Today it is too much the case that our young, vigorous, intelligent women feel that only the aged should be connected with the Relief Society. This is a mistake. We want the young women, the intelligent women, women of faith, of courage and of purity to be associated with the Relief Societies of the various stakes and wards of Zion. We want them to take hold of this work with vigor, with intelligence and unitedly, for the building up of Zion and the instruction of women in their duties - domestic duties, public duties, and every duty that may devolve upon them (SMITH, JOSEPH F., Gospel Doctrine, Tenth Edition, pp. 386, 387). I was startled upon one occasion to have announced by a certain women's'. Organization that one of our past Relief Society presidents had graduated from the Relief Society into this other women's organization. Let there be no uncertainty in the minds of our Latter-day Saint women as to the Relief Society being the greatest of all women's organizations. There is no other greater organization on the face of the earth for the Latter-day Saint. Wife or mother. Sister Spafford has so kindly spoken of my daughter Helen. (This isn't on the script, darling.) When she was a teenager, the patriarch gave her a blessing. 8 Her older sister had received a blessing in which she was told that she would be a missionary, a great missionary, and _ this sweet daughter was told that she would be a shining light in the great Relief Society program of the Church. Carefree, careless, both of them; they may have placed their own individual interpretations, but now the wheels of time have moved on. This other, yes, who knows, she is now an angel, maybe, in the realms on high, is one of the great missionaries. In the temple today, one of the Brethren bore witness to having sat in meditation and having recalled an experience in the Logan Temple when a sister in deep sorrow had come to him because of the loss of her companion, then a few days later she came back and was all in ecstasy, never happier in her life than now, and he said, '""What's happened to change you?" "The last few days," she said, "T went to the assembly room in the Logan Temple. There were some other couples in that room, and as I sat there, I heard the most heavenly music. Then, after it was ended I said to the people there with me, "Did you hear that music?" They all said, "Yes, we heard it." In my mind, as he spoke, [I thought of my own sweet missionary daughter. In my mind's eye she could have been accompanying that kind of heavenly choir because she majored in music to be the great missionary that God apparently intended her to be. Woman's place in training her family is the third phase of this The Role of Women in Building the Kingdom work that I want to mention. ['ll quote a few significant scriptures and then draw some obvious conclusions. The Lord said: But, behold I say unto you, that little children are redeemed from the foundation of the world through mine Only Begotten; Wherefore, they cannot sin, for power is not given unto Satan to tempt little children, until they begin to become accountable before me; For it is given unto them even as I will, according to mine own pleasure, that great things may be required at the hands of their fathers (D&C 29:46-48). Now what is the age of accountability and what are those great things that God requires of the fathers of children, which, by inference, means mothers as well, during this period before little children begin to become accountable before the Lord? Now the age of accountability, the Lord, in another verse of revelation, says is eight years of age. No one can be received into the Church unless he has arrived. At the age of accountability. Parents are admonished to have their children baptized when they are eight years of age and teach them the fundamental principles of the gospel, and their children shall be baptized for the remission of their sins and receive the laying on of hands. Children should be taught to pray and walk uprightly before the Lord, and so on. Now the conclusions and logical deductions. Great things are required of fathers and mothers before Satan has power to tempt little children. What are the great things? Have you ever thought of that? Before Satan has a chance to lay hold on a little child, it is the responsibility of the parents to lay a solid foundation by teaching Latter-day Saint standards by example and by precept. In other words, to you and to the sisters over whom you preside, it means the making of a career of motherhood. Let nothing supersede that career. Do teach mothers to take full advantage of the Family Home Evening lessons each week. I was down to Cedar City just after Family Home Evenings were provided with a full course of lessons for each week. Why that startled the Church to think that now we had prepared a lesson that the parents, each week, could teach. Six hundred fifty thousand manuals were sent and put into the home of every parent, so no one could say, "We didn't have a manual," or "We couldn't afford one." They were put in the hands of every parent. And I was anxious to see how we were getting off at this stake conference. I asked if they would call in some in whose homes the family home night lessons were being taught, and they called a young Singing Mother from out of the chorus upon the stand. This mother said they had just begun their lessons when she and her husband were asked if they would be dance instructors until after the dance festival. Now you have heard of things like this happening. As they began to try to find a night when they could get all these participants in the festival, every night was preempted except one, and you can guess what night that was. It was the night of the Family Home Evening, that had supposedly been held sacred for 9 January 1967 Family Home Evening. Well, they said to the children, "We guess that until the festival is over, we'll have to give up the Family Home Evening." So, with regrets, they went to the task of this dance festival, and a few nights thereafter they came home late, weary from their exertions. They were awakened around daylight the next morning by the sound of their children's voices in the front room downstairs. When they went down the children were all dressed, and there was a blazing fire in the fireplace. The fifteen-year-old daughter, the night before, had engineered the children in preparing the preliminaries for an early morning breakfast which consisted, as I remember, of peeled potatoes which, when allowed to stand overnight had taken on a darkish hue—black potatoes. When the _ parents asked what this was all about, they said, "Well, Mother and Dad, when you said you couldn't find a night for us to have Family Home Evening, we counseled together and decided, then, that hereafter we were going to have Family Home Evening at five o'clock in the morning. We are all here now. Breakfast is ready. It will take only a few minutes; now give us the Family Home Evening lesson." And as this sweet mother stood there and the tears streamed down her cheeks, she said, '"'As I sat down to that breakfast of blackened potatoes, they were the best tasting potatoes that I have ever had in my whole life, and I resolved that never again was I going to let anything take precedence over my responsibil- 10 ity in teaching my family on a Family Home Evening." Now, you teach the women and mothers to do likewise. Mother's first sacrifice is to become a mother. I was going to do something today, Helen, but I don't know whether I dare or not— just a quote from our oldest daughter when she had her first baby. She was in a hospital in California, and I was going to read a bit from Helen's sixteenyear-old letter to her mother in an attempt to demonstrate in our own family how the great influence of mother had _ been passed on to two lovely daughters who, in turn, now are passing it on to ten grandchildren. Presumably those ten children, if the record is kept up, will go on and on throughout the generations as these, my family, become part of my eternal kingdom in the world yet to come. I don't think I'll try to say what I thought I would read to you. My feelings are a little bit tender today. Pain and suffering coming in or going out of the world seem to be a part of the plan, and mothers were promised that in pain and travail they would bring forth children. You remember Mother Eve's promise. She and her daughters would be saved in child bearing. Saved! I thought. That meant protected so they would go through delivery of their babies, unscathed. ['m not so sure that that's what it means now, but I know that if mothers will do their part, even though it costs their lives, that their eternal reward in our Father's celestial world will be certain. I was up at Blackfoot, Idaho, The Role of Women in Building the Kingdom I guess I shouldn't have said that, but I'll have to go through with it now. I had made a blunder when I found that there had been assignments to husbands and wives that took them both out of their home at the same time, and left their children. Unattended. I scolded a bit over the pulpit, and one of the counselors scolded me between sessions by saying, 'Well, we'll have a whole stake resignation after that talk." I thought I'd better repent. So, in the afternoon session, I was sitting by the Relief Society president of the stake, a lovely mother, now in her late sixties. She had raised a family of nine, and all of them while she was presiding in one capacity or another. She had been in Primary, in the MIA, and now president of the stake Relief Society. And without knowing what she would say, I said to her, 'Sister, I wish you would get up and tell these folks how you've been able to raise a remarkable family, all of them now married in the temple, and still be able to carry on in your Church work as-you are."' I couldn't have written the script for Sister Christensen's talk any better than she gave it. She said, "Well, first, I followed the example in raising my family of my own wonderful mother. I merely followed the example she gave us, so I tried to raise mine as she had raised us. Second, I have a wonderful companion. Daddy always felt that I should have a Church activity just as he had. So when we were called to a position, we would sit down with the bishop or stake president, and we would try to work it out and see if, while daddy's responsibilities were taking him out of the home, I could be there with the children, and when my responsibilities took me out of the home, daddy could be there with the children." She said, "That's the way we have worked together so that our children were never left without father or mother." Finally, she said, "Third, I have an unshakeable testimony of the divine mission of the Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ." I say to you, there are the three hallmarks of great motherhood in the training of children in a family home. And now, finally, a fourth role of mothers is the building of a home here and laying a foundation for a home in eternity. What is a home? There are some rather apt quotes which indicate what I want you to get. "Home is a roof over a good woman." But if the roof is lacking or the woman is lacking, it isn't any home. It takes both. "Home is the seminary of all other institutions." "The most essential element in any home is God." "A man is always nearest to his God when he's at home and farthest from God when he is away." (This could be true to a degree, that in the home, there is the good in-. Fluence of a true wife and mother.) "Home is the place when you go there they have to take you in." That's the boy or girl who stays out late until you've worried yourself sick and comes trooping in at one, two, or three o'clock in the morning, but, after all, that's his home, that's her home. Yes, home is the place that when you go there, they have to take you in. 11 January 1967 Now just a word about another subject. President Joseph F. Smith said something else that I've carried in my mind these years, something about the importance of owning your own home. Now we're drifting away from that today. And I want you to get the importance of what he said here. It was early the rule among the Latter-day Saints to have the lands so divided that every family could have a spot of ground which could be called theirs; and it has been the proud boast of this people that among them were more home owners than among any other people of like numbers. This condition had a good tendency, and whatever men said of us, the home among this people was a first consideration. It is this love of home that has made the saints famous as colonizers, builders of settlements, and redeemers of the deserts. But in the cities there appears now to be coming into vogue the idea that renting is the thing. Of course, it may be necessary as a temporary makeshift, but no young couple should ever settle down with the idea that such a condition, as far as they are concerned, shall be permanent. Every young man should have an ambition to possess his own home. It is better for him, for his family, for security, for the state, and for the Church. Nothing so engenders _ stability, strength, power, patriotism, fidelity to country and to God as the owning of a home - a spot of earth that you and your children can call yours. And besides, there are so many tender virtues that grow with ownership that the government of a_ family is made doubly easy thereby (SMITH, JOSEPH F., Gospel Doctrine, Tenth Edition, page 305). Now a home, I would impress, not only a home here, but building a home for the eternity. This is a phase of it, and I shall close with this, with one or two obvious conclusions. The Lord said: 12 And again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife by my word, which is my law, and by the new and everlasting covenant, and it is sealed unto them by the Holy Spirit of promise.... They shall pass by the angels, and the gods, which are set there, to their exaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their heads, which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever (D&C 132:19). Now, the Prophet Joseph Smith, commenting on this scripture, explained: Except a man and his wife enter into an everlasting covenant and be married for eternity, while in this probation, by the power and authority of the Holy Priesthood, they will cease to increase when they die; that is, they will not have any children after the resurrection. But those who are married by the power and authority of the priesthood in this life, and continue without committing the sin against the Holy Ghost, will continue to increase and have children in the celestial glory (SMITH, JOSEPH FIELDING, Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, pages 300-301). Our First Presidency in our latter days has said: So far as the stages of eternal progression and attainment have been made through divine revelation, we are to understand that only the resurrected and glorified beings can become the parents of spirit offspring. Only such exalted souls have reached maturity in the appointed course of eternal life; and the spirits born to them in the eternal worlds will pass in due sequence through the several stages or estates by which the glorified parents have obtained exaltation (The First Presidency, June 30, 1916, "The Father and the Son," page 8). Now the conclusions. Woman has within her the power of creation in company with her legal and lawful husband here, and if The Role of Women in Building the Kingdom sealed in celestial wedlock, may have eternal increase in the world to come. Woman is the homemaker in her own home, and an exemplar to her posterity in the generations that succeed her. Woman is a helpmate to her husband and to render him more perfect than he otherwise would be. Woman's influence can bless a community or a nation to that extent to which she develops her spiritual powers in harmony with the heaven-sent gifts which she has been by nature endowed. If she does not forfeit her priceless heritage by her own willful negligence, she can be largely instrumental in safeguarding democracy and downing a would-be tyrant. Year in and year out, she may cast the aura of her calming and refining influence to make certain that her posterity will enjoy the opportunities to develop to their fullest potential their spiritual and physical natures. Now this is a rather sensitive thing that I shall close with. We had one in high station in government circles who has made a suggestion which was highly applauded, according to a great educator whose words I'm going to quote. It made the suggestion that all young persons in this country, boys and girls, perhaps, should be required, whether in peace or war, to give a year or two of their lives in some kind of national service. Then this wise educator said this. Now don't you quote me as saying this, but you say that I said, he said that: There are a lot of folks who think that it is just as vital for a young Los Angeles woman to get married and rear a family with respect to law and rights of men as it is for another young woman to work in a poverty program of some sort. The young engineers who develop techniques in our industry are as important to the strength of this country as the special assistants who inhabit the big Federal agencies. There are weeks in this city, in fact, when after a plethora of conferences and meetings, such as the recent one on the status of women, the residents would gladly barter half a dozen status officials for one mother who wants more than anything to bring love and beauty into the lives of her children, or they would trade a whole conference in Washington for one grandfather who would round up the _ neighborhood children and take them on a hike. (Dr. MAx RAFFERTY, California State Superintendent of Public | Instruction.) Now that's, unquote, all of that I quote for you to think about. So I close with a prayer, God render our wives, our sweethearts, our mothers even more perfect in order to hold the bearers of the Priesthood, under their influence, to a truer course of happiness here and eternal joy in the world to come, for which I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 13 Relief Society Centennial Memorial Bell Tower President Belle S. Spafford [Address Delivered at the Services Commemorating Bell Tower Completion, September 29, 1966] w A quarter of a century ago, the General Board of Relief Society and the sisters in the stakes and missions of the Church under the leadership of President Amy Brown Lyman, busily engaged themselves in preparing appropriate observances for the 100th anniversary of the founding of Relief Society. The Church-wide celebration was planned to be held in connection with the Relief Society General Conference, April 1942. (At that time, Relief Society held semi-annual conferences.) A number of impressive and significant programs were planned, designed to make the Centennial an epical period in the history of Relief Society. As plans moved forward, however, Sister Lyman and her board began to feel a need for a permanent memorial—something that would endure long after the 100th birthday was passed. From 14 Howard Barker an article in The Relief Society Magazine (November 1941, page 769) by Mary Grant Judd, Chairman of the Centennial observance, I quote:... Unless we do something about it, the time will come when this wonderful occasion will be a thing of the past and will live only in our memories. And so it has come to the General Board with ever-increasing clearness that some permanent memorial should be left—something of lasting value. The Centennial Observance Committee, consisting of Mary G. Judd, Edith S. Elliott, Rae B. Barker, and Anna B. Hart, was assigned to make recommendations and work out details for the permanent memorial project. Again I quote from Sister Judd: Casting about for a suitable project, the idea came to mind of hanging the historic Nauvoo Temple bell in a permanent and beautiful setting.... Courtesy, Salt Lake Tribune Services at the Completion of The Relief Society Memorial Campanile, September 29, 1966 Elder Mark E. Petersen of the Council of the Twelve, offering prayer at the podium; President Hugh B. Brown, of the First Presidency, seated, fifth from the right behind the podium; Elder S. Dilworth Young, of the First Council of Seventy, seated in front of the podium third from the right. General President of Relief Society Belle S. Spafford seated seventh from the left behind the podium. We feel that it is peculiarly fitting that the Relief Society should sponsor this project because one of the reasons for the organization of our Society in Nauvoo was to enable the Latter-day Saint women more efficently to do their part in feeding and clothing the men who were working on the Temple where the bell originally hung. There is still another tie connecting us with the bell. In the same pioneer company which transported this valuable relic to the West came Eliza R. Snow, and safe in her keeping, in the covered wagon that lumbered over the plains, were the precious minutes of our founding meeting. Sister Lyman was enthusiastic over the erection of a permanent Centennial memorial, not alone in recognition of a highly significant event in the history of the Church—the founding of Relief Society—but in recognition of the lofty position accorded women in the restored gospel. She responded warmly to the idea of a Campanile for the Nauvoo Temple bell, for she knew the ties that bound Relief Society to this historic vessel. The First Presidency — President Heber J. Grant, President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., and Pres- | ident David O. McKay — gave the General Board "not only their permission but their enthuslastic encouragement" to go forward with the erection of the bell tower on Temple Square. Accord- 15 January 1967 2 16 ake «adios ts Re Bosc Po feet is Ponce aOR! Photos by Howard Barker ing to General Board records, it was later learned through the Presiding Bishopric, that the idea of hanging the Nauvoo bell in a permanent setting had been under consideration for some time, but no definite decision had been made. The sisters felt that perhaps the decision "had been slowed up in order that Relief Society might have the privilege." The structure was to be built by small contributions from Relief Society members. The service of an able architect, Brother Lorenzo Snow Young, a grandson of Brigham Young and a grandnephew of Eliza R. Snow, was enlisted to design the tower. The base was to be of granite, the top of grilled bronze to harmonize with the bronze bell. There were to be four plaques in bas-relief—one on each of the four sides near the: base. The plaques were to be designed by an eminent Utah sculptor, Dr. Avard Fairbanks, with three of the series, in turn, titled: '"Pioneering,"' '""Education," and "'Benevolence."' The fourth was to be an inscription plaque, a tribute to the sisters and their work, entitled: "The Relief Society Centennial Memorial." Work on the project moved forward. The granite was delivered; the bronze grillwork top was made ready; the plaques were cast, when, suddenly, the tragedy of war came upon us. Many of the regular activities of Relief Society had to be curtailed, some temporarily discontinued. Centennial plans had to be greatly modified and work on the Campanile was stopped, including the financial contribution program. Materials were stored Relief Society Centennial Memorial Bell Tower in facilities arranged by the Presiding Bishopric, to await a favorable day for the completion of the historical memorial. It was not until 1945 that activities were restored to normal. In April 1945, a new Relief Society Presidency was named — President Belle S. Spafford, with Marianne C. Sharp and Gertrude R. Garff as Counselors, succeeding President Amy B. Lyman, Marcia K. Howells, and Belle S. Spafford. Shortly thereafter, death claimed President Heber J. Grant, and a new Presidency of the Church was sustained—President George Albert Smith, with President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., and President David O. McKay as Counselors. President Smith endorsed the erection of the Campanile on Temple Square, making clear to the new Relief Society Presidency their responsibilities to complete the project which had meant so much to Sister Lyman, her Board, and the sisters of Relief Society. Because of the urgent need of Relief Society for a headquarters building, however, which involved a big collection program, President Smith and his Counselors deemed it advisable to hold in abeyance the completion of the memorial until the Relief Society Building was erected and dedicated. Prior to the completion of the Building, President Smith was called home, and President McKay was sustained as President of the Church, with Elder Stephen L Richards and Elder J. Reuben Clark, Jr., as Counselors. Through the years, President McKay, familiar with the history of the memorial, has not lost, ite oi ps & Z mad: | ee a en ye 4 IS INTELLIGENCE January 1967 sight of this uncompleted project. From time to time the question of its completion has been considered with the Relief Society Presidency. At no time has there appeared to be any thought of abandoning the project. It was a happy occasion when, on August 19, 1966, the Relief Society Presidency received word that authorization had been given by President McKay to go forward immediately with the erection of the structure. It was to be located on Temple Square at a site agreeable to the Relief Society Presidency and the Temple Square Committee. The site determined upon by those two groups was midway between the Tabernacle and the Assembly Hall, toward the west wall of the Square. In response to the express desire of the General Presidency, authorization was granted to meet the costs of completing the structure from General Board funds. Brother Howard Barker, a former member of the Church Building Committee, assigned to the Campanile project, and a man who has shown dedicated interest in the memorial through the years, has devoted endless hours to locating and assembling the stored parts, a number of which had been moved from their original storage place. Fortunately, every part was located. Elder Mark B. Garff and his associates on the Building Committee promptly took hold of the erection of the structure, putting forth special effort to have it ready for viewing during this conference. We are, therefore, pleased to announce the completion of the Relief Society Cen- 18 tennial Memorial — a project initiated a quarter of a century ago. We acknowledge with grateful appreciation the support and cooperation of Elder Mark E. Petersen, Chairman of the Temple Square Committee, and his associates on the committee. These brethren have been understanding and considerate. We appreciate the efforts of Brother Mark B. Garff and his associates, and Brother Howard Barker for his valuable service. To our present First Presidency, President David O. McKay, Presidents Hugh B. Brown, Nathan Eldon Tanner, Joseph Fielding Smith, and Thorpe B. Isaacson, we express most humble and grateful thanks for their interest and concern in bringing to fulfillment the dream of Sister Lyman, her Board, and the sisters of the Centennial day that there should be on Temple Square a permanent memorial which you, today, may have the choice privilege of viewing at the close of this meeting—a memorial erected to the honored position of women in the gospel plan; a Centennial Memorial honoring the founding of Relief Society; a memorial approved by three great Presidents of the Church, President Grant, President Smith, and President McKay. And here shall hang the bell known as the Nauvoo Temple Bell — a treasured bell to be preserved in a new and beautiful setting for all to enjoy. And as people pause to view it in its new setting, may their vision be opened to the importance of the place and work of the women of the Church. @ The Relief Society General Board is pleased to announce the names of the three winners in the 1966 Relief Society Poem Contest (formerly the Eliza R.

FIRST PRIZE POEM a ae ee m as THE NAVAJO RUG Barbara J. Warren Like pieces of fallen cloud, the sheep are scattered on the hillside. In the summer's hot wind and the winter's cold, the woman herds them. To the hills in the day, to the corral at night,, To fresh grass and water she herds them. The rug begins in Strength. A storm drapes itself around the mountain. The sheep are restless. They scatter. The woman tries to gather them. She cannot. She kneels in the dust of the land to pray. The sheep come together. To the rug is added Faith. The sheep are sheared. The wool stands in fat bags against the hogan wall. Now the carding begins. Short, quick strokes. Fibers straight. Dirt combed out. Now the spinning begins. Turning, turning, turning, turning of the spindle While knowing fingers pull the wool into a strong, straight thread. Now the washing begins; now the dyeing begins. Into the rug goes Patience. The rug grows slowly on the loom. Its design, unwritten, has gathered itself in the mind of one Who has long looked out upon the land And seen its ever-changing colors and patterns. The rug is woven in Beauty. The way to the trading post is long, And when the woman gets there, what will she buy? Lengths of sateen and velvet that shine like shimmering jewels on the shelf? New dishes, a cooking pot — hers is so old. No. This and this and — yes — this for her children. And this and this for her man. For herself, not a thing. The rug is finished in Love. The woman is gone. You come to buy. The price is too much? No, my friend. Not for this rug. Not for what is in it. All that the woman is, is in this rug. All she thinks, all she believes, all her skills, all she dreams of and hopes for Have been woven into one in this rug. And for all this, the price is never too much. Because you see, my friend, The rug is the Woman. 20 Barbara Warren First Prize Winner The Relief Society Poem Contest Barbara Warren, a young newcomer to the pages of the Relief Society Magazine, writes from her present home in Lukachukai, Arizona, sketching highlights of her life and work: '1 was born in Missoula, Montana, and lived there until graduation from Brigham Young University, when | began teaching in a Government boarding school!

During my time spent among the Lamanite people, | had many opportunities to observe the making of the Navajo rugs.

At day, a monarch, ruling—jewel-crowned And virgin-peaked, lake-mirrored gray and blue— A kingdom of contented sight and sound— The legioned pines, the moose-cow in the slue. No fear is on this land, yet at your feet, Thin-covered by the earth's uncertain crust, Unfathomed forces lie and spout their heat In geysered vent and deep, infernal thrust. And now, moon-bathed, your splendor glows with light In opal-fired and iridescent night. On such a silver night as this a quake Exploded Hebgen's summer-shadowed floor And slid a mountain's tonnage, tipped a lake And stopped a river—stilled forevermore The laughter in the trees, the soft guitar, The scurryings where dust alone was breath, And here in testament a livid scar And fissured earth remain—and death. The cruel scarp along the mountain's length, The drowning trees, the shore, betray the fault Which undermined the valley's rock-ribbed strength— When all seemed peace—in ruinous assault. And where are they who trusted in its calm, Nor read the printed warning in its palm? If, suddenly, the force which gave you birth Erupts its epicenter at your base, Withstand the throes of inner-tortured earth, Meet threat with strength along your granite face, Travail with triumph. Ride the heaving crest. Let avalanche but serve to shore your beams, Survive as elk survive the antlered test. Let molten rock be solder for your seams. For you are symboled part of balanced law— No stature unassailed is proven might— Point and counterpoint; perfection, flaw. Lf still you stand as now in noble height When winds have swept the dark, volcanic cloud, | shall be full of joy. I shall be proud!

Sweet Orpah's kiss still lingers on my cheek, Her love has eased a deep and poignant pain. And mine will follow her with rich content As shadows lift and tear-dimmed memories wane. You will not leave? Then let us bend our steps toward Bethlehem Where clouds caress the curve of distant hills, Where barley fields lie golden in the sun And in the opal dawn a wild bird trills. And if the way to Judah seems o'erlong i shall not weary, knowing all the while That tired feet and hearts grow strong again When lifted on the quick wings of a smile. Rejoice, my soul! How blessed is she whose child by ties of blood Forsaking others, chooses to abide. How more then J, when bonds of love alone Ho! D a once alien daughter to my side!

Myrna Clawson m So that everything would go perfectly, Andrea had spent her entire day preparing for this evening. A chicken and _ rice casserole was waiting in the oven, tossed green salad and banana cream pie were ready, too. She had checked to be sure she had the table all set in the dining room. Bert would be home any minute, they would eat and then get ready for the concert — a pop concert to be conducted by Theodor Ravinsky. Andrea and Bert had attended one of his concerts when they were in college ten years before; and for Andrea no other conductor could equal him. Why wasn't Bert home, wondered Andrea? She decided to remove the rollers and comb her hair out while she waited; this would save time later. She 27 brushed the hair back from her forehead then teased and flicked the auburn tresses into place. Leaving the mirror, she glanced at herself again, pushed a curl back from her cheek and smiled. She felt warm and wonderful; it had been a long time since she had been so happy, so excited! With almost a start, she realized that Bert wasn't home yet. Now their supper would be late and her schedule disordered. She asked the children to wash so that they would be ready to eat as soon as Bert walked in. He enjoyed dinner with the family; it was a time he could enjoy their reports of the day's experiences. Andrea looked out the front window to see if Bert might be coming, she went back to the dining 28 room, she paced into and out of the kitchen. Why was he late? Bert's arrival erased Andrea's anxiety; there was plenty of time to get ready for the concert. She gathered the four older children around the table and seated Kirk in his high chair. Baby Lucille, who had already eaten, jabbered from the playpen. "Where are you __ going, Mommy?" quizzed Vera, who was SIX. "Why can't we go?" chirped four-year old Patty. Kirk overturned his pie-filled plate on his head, beamed and announced, ''Hat, hat!" The questions were forgotten as the children broke into uproarious laughter. Andrea felt her plans crumbling around her. "Quiet down and finish your dinners!"' she ordered. There was a grave, but short silence as she began to rescue Kirk from the pie. By the time she had the pie wiped off Kirk and the floor, Bert had excused himself and the children had almost finished eating. She cleared the emptied plates along with her unfinished pie. Andrea knew that what she accomplished now was only with permission of the unconcerned face staring at her from the wall. The solemn timepiece told her she had better be satisfied with stacking the dishes; she needed to be getting the children into their pajamas. Andrea sent Patty and Vera upstairs to their room to dress for bed while she undressed Kirk. He held up a bare foot and begged, "Piggy market?" Andrea played "Piggy market" with each foot, then Kirk pleaded, "Gain." "How "bout Itsy Bitsy Spider?" As the spider crawled up his arm he squealed and pulled his arm away. Taking his turn, he jumped his chubby hand, spider fashion, up his mother's arm. Andrea bounced him into her arms for a squeeze. He wiggled and squirmed, delighted. When it was time for him to put his feet into his pajamas, she was done with the play and demanded, "Hold still, Kirk! How can I dress you with all your squirming?" "Mommy," pleaded Patty from the stairway, "I can't find my pajamas." "Oh, no!"' Andrea half said and half thought. "TI'll be right there as soon as I snap Kirk's top." Who Loves Here? She responded loudly enough for Patty to hear. The search snatched at Andrea's precious minutes and seized almost all of her composure in locating his pajamas — the top in the doll clothes drawer and the bottom under the bed. "T'll help you —" Andrea had started before the phone interrupted. Bert was in the shower so Andrea rushed down the stairs to answer it. THE oh-so-friendly voice on the line reminded, "Don't forget PTA tomorrow afternoon at three!"' "Thank you," answered Andrea, dropping the receiver, "how could I forget it—three calls to remind me?" she mumbled. Noises coming from the kitchen told her that Kirk must be into something. Sure enough, he had helped himself to the Sugar Crisp and now, on the floor, was doing his best to put them back into the box, To Andrea, it was one crisis after another. The children, who had been hurried and felt their mother's excitement, were in high gear. By the time she had tucked Kirk and Lucille into the beds, Kevin and Dallon, seven and eight years old, had model airplanes in process on the living room floor. Andrea put an end to that. "'How many times have I told you that there is to be no airplane glue used in this room? Now take all this mess to the nook table — and use a newspaper on the table!" Andrea's schedule indicated that it was time to leave for the concert. Thank goodness she had ye January 1967 had practice in dressing in seconds. It seemed only moments later when Andrea, although flushed, came into her living room with the semblance of a model introducing next season's lines. The little girls eyed her as_ they would have looked upon a queen. Kevin bounded in and came to a halt. "You sure are pretty, Mom." Dallon, following, added, "I like your new dress." Andrea beamed—she felt like royalty. She was pleased with her accomplishments of the previous day, when she had finished making the silver-blue peau de soie dress with the empire waist. With a second admiring glance, one realized it was a maternity dress. Bert placed his arm around Andrea's waist. "Shall we go, my dear?" She kissed each of the children goodbye and they stepped out the door just as the phone broke the captivating spell Andrea had begun to feel. As Bert talked, Andrea eyed her watch and calculated that there were only twelve and one half minutes remaining; then she comforted sobbing Patty, who had been the subject of Dallon's teasing, gave instructions for repairing a wing, to an airplane builder, and reminded the baby sitter about Lucille's bottle in the refrigerator. "Uncle Harold will only be here tomorrw morning?" Andrea quizzed Bert as he_ slipped through the first intersection on an amber signal. "I'm glad we didn't miss his call." Waiting for the second signal, she knew it 30 would be rare luck if they could buck the traffic in time to hear the first number tonight. Hurry, hurry, hurry since at least four in the afternoon. Bert and Andrea were in their seats now, but she still felt hurried. She wondered what the children might be into at home. It was past the announced curtain time — why the delay? Andrea, so keyed to a rushed schedule, was caught by surprise when Bert remarked, "I'm glad we arrived early enough to enjoy the anticipation and excitement of the concert hall. Aren't you?" "Yes, I am," Andrea answered blankly. "You know that tooth that Kirk hit when he fell Saturday? Do you think it will tum dark?" The house lights began to dim, the curtain rose, Andrea began to forget. The first strains of melody were relaxing, and she was soon translated from her busy world of reponsibility into a world of music. At intermission, Andrea, enthralled with the performance, chatted with Bert. They were young again as they recalled the first Ravinsky concert they had attended. Andrea felt the romance of the earlier evening. Life was perfect. "Do you think the lady sitting beside you is alone?" Bert asked. A group of concert-goers who had been sitting on the other side of the lady had left. Andrea turned to her, "Isn't the music grand? It is so — so lovely I can't describe it. Vivacious, that might be the word." "Y'm enjoying it," the lady answered. "T guess this music is special to Who Loves Here? Another baby on the way, another demanding cry, another toddler under foot when she was busy, more diapers, more wash, more, more, more? Tears welled, an unbearable lump was in her throat; she stared at the ceiling, trying to '; prevent the tears from revealing her feelings. As the light dimmed Ja" a she felt relief and then suddenly ray me because I also know the ideals Theodor Ravinsky lives. Marvelous conductor and outstanding person!" Andrea bubbled, ''Isn't it something that such a man would even come to Bedlington? The paper said he came here by special request. He must be the finest conductor in our country." "Oh, do you think so?' replied the lady, who must have been in her eighties. She had noticed Andrea's dress and, after hesitating, she asked, "Ts this to be your first child?" Andrea paused as stinging remarks she had heard before raced through her mind — ''Are you PG again?" "Don't you know when to quit?" "No, this will be my seventh child,"' Andrea answered. "Really? How fortunate you are! Children are such a blessing and comfort. You see, I had seven youngsters myself." Andrea only heard part of the remark. The thought of children transported her back to _ the hustle, bustle, and confusion of one and a half hours ago. How could she be fortunate to have ashamed — children were supposed to be a blessing! Trying to convince herself how truly fortunate she was, she felt, for a moment, she could control the tears; but instead her emotions controlled her and a tear burned down her face. Why couldn't she be thankful for one thing— that the musicians were ready and Maestro Ravinsky's baton, held high, would momentarily command and eighty-five musicians would follow its every stroke and _ hesitation? Music would fill the entire concert hall; its melody, vibrant strains and drama would again captivate Andrea. The baton flashed, the musicians came to life, and Andrea was filled with shock. The clash, the racing, the clamor of "The Carmen Overture" mockingly echoed the frequent turmoil of her own home. It was children running wildly in the house, children yelling, children bickering, children, noise, confusion, children, children, children. She felt she couldn't stand another instant of being mimicked. Turning to Bert, enraptured with the majesty of the performance, Andrea resolved to conquer her emotions and enjoy the evening. Music softens the heart, music soothes, music lightens the load, 31 January 1967 music mellows. Andrea ignored her own thoughts and listened, watching the violins. She was swept away~- with the _lighthearted waltz from Strauss' "Gypsy Baron." With the final ovation, Bert nudged her elbow, ''Let's go!"' Andrea, entranced, lingered to help the lady with her coat, then arose. Entering the aisle Bert looked back and proposed to Andrea, "'She is alone?" "Yes,''? Andrea answered. The lady was still seated, so Bert returned to offer her assistance. She seemed grateful for his help and relied on his arm to steady herself. Reaching the lobby, Bert felt concerned for the woman. His eyes, asking what next, turned and met Andrea's sympathetic glance. "I'm meeting my son just over there," the lady offered. A wave of relief passed over Bert as he learned her plans. Accompanying her across the room, Bert suggested, '"We will wait with you until he comes." "Would you?" She seemed glad that they would wait. Then turning obviously to Bert alone, in a whisper, she added, "I'd like your wife to meet my son." Bert was a bit baffled, and Andrea felt slighted by the hushed remark. Waiting, as they watched the crowd thin, Bert noticed a man coming toward them and turned to Andrea. "Is that?" "Thank you for waiting with Mother," the man interrupted. The lady smiled at her son, turned to Andrea, and said, "I would like you to meet my seventh child, Theodor Ravinsky." As Andrea checked each child before going to her bed, she tousled their hair and_ kissed their foreheads one by one. What wonderful blessings her children were to her. She hesitated in wonder before leaving the second room. Who are these children? Whom am I loving—teaching? A musician? A teacher? A_ president? A prophet? Who will my seventh child be? Myrna Clawson, Modesto, California, is a first-time winner in the Relief Society Short Story Contest. ''Having my story awarded first prize is a humbling honor. My literary experience began about a year and a half ago, with a Brigham Young University correspondence course. In addition to 'Who Loves Here?' | have had two children's stories accepted. My husband Jim and | attended Brigham Young University in 1954, through 1956. There | enjoyed all the classes having to do with homemaking. We now have six busy children, ranging in ages from one to nine. "After spending six years in the Relief Society organization of our ward, | am now serving as counselor in the Primary. Jim serves as counselor in the bishopric. We find many challenges and much joy in serving the Lord through Church work and rearing our family. | am grateful for the opportunities for growth and understanding which the Church and Relief Society provide for young mothers." 32 Ramona W. Cannon "Fiesta Mexicana,'' featuring thirty women dancers from Mexico City, is receiving enthusiastic acclaim in many nations, including France, Spain, Italy, Germany (Berlin), England, Japan, and the United States. The dancers bring to life, with authentic and beautiful costumes and music from ancient instruments, the ritualistic and _ preHispanic dances from Mayan and Aztec cultures. Among the dancers, Malinda Ortiz, Princess Teo Xochitel, Maria Luiza Ortix, and Antonieta Casas have received outstanding recognition. Maureen Forrester, one of the world's leading contraltos, 'flawlessly _ performed"' the role of Cornelia in Handel's 'Julius Caesar' in October for New York City Opera's opening production. '"'The rich tonalities of her deep velvet voice' were highly praised. Of Scotch-Irish descent, she was born in Montreal, Canada, and is married to Canadian Conductor-Violinist Eugene Kash. Anna Kuulei Furtado Kahanamoku is the only woman member of the Hawaii State Senate. Reared on the island of Maui, she was early influenced by her parents and other relatives to take an active interest in Hawaiian culture and civic affairs. Her work in the Senate reflects this heritage. She is active in legislation affecting the welfare of women, both in the home and in industry. Formerly a schoolteacher, she encourages Hawaiian women to avail themselves of educational opportunities in order to enable them better to direct and influence their children. Mrs. Lael W. Hill, Salt Lake City, Utah, a contributor to The Relief Society Magazine, and winner of first place in the 1959 Eliza R. Snow Poem Contest, is author of 'Legacy of Years,'' a poem collection which won the 1966 Linnie Fisher Robinson $100 prize, and publication by the Utah State Poetry Society. Mrs. Hill, a gifted artist, designed also the attractive and meaningful cover for her book. Miss Dorothy Larrison, from Indiana, is assistant editor for college division textbooks, Bobbs-Merrill Publishing Company. "Textbooks today are superb in content and interesting to read,'' she comments. Mrs. J. Howard Auchincloss, mother of distinguished novelist Louis S. Auchincloss, wielded a strong influence in her home. Her famous son says: "l always felt Mother should be the novelist in the family. She inculcated my tremendous feeling for fiction. When somebody says 'fiction' to me, my flash association is Mother reading Robert Louis Stevenson aloud." Mrs. Julie C. Fuller is president of the national organization of American Women in Radio and Television. She attends the area conventions each year and is continually alert to the woman's point of view, which, she says, is becoming wider and more fully informed, because women wish to understand why events nationally and world-wide happen as they do, and what efforts women can make to increase the prevalence of law and order on all levels of community life. 33 The Joy of Volunteer Service Volume 54 January 1967 Number 1 M@ Belle S.

Smith Jennie R. Scott Lucile P. Peterson Alice L. Wilkinson Elaine B. Curtis Irene W. Buehner Zelma R. West w Never has the need and recognition of volunteer work been so publicized as it is today. In spite of all that governments are endeavoring to do to ameliorate the conditions of people in unfortunate circumstances, it is admitted that there is nothing so valuable to the unfortunate person as a warm, friendly, helping personal companionship which says to the disadvantaged, there is someone who cares, | am a humble human being as you are, and I'm interested in you. | am solicitous of your welfare, | want to help you. From the time a girl reaches maturity there is always some avenue through which she can serve outside her own _ family circle as her family and Church responsibilities permit. This volunteer service will add richness and understanding to her own life, in addition to the satisfaction she will feel in knowing that she is serving someone who needs her service. Over the years, schemes and corporations have evolved which have been established for the betterment of mankind, such as the Red Cross, Traveler's Aid, Health Programs, Child Care Clinics, hospitals, both to heal the body and the mind, assistance to women while in prison and after release, youth guidance work, detention homes, parent-teacher associations, to name a few. In different countries different names are given, but the work is basically the same. While these services are generally manned by salaried personnel, of necessity, for trained guidance and continuity, the success, extent, and effectiveness of the programs are dependent, in large measure, upon the good offices of volunteers. It is the people to people work which humanizes the proferred service and helps to accomplish its purposes. As a Latter-day Saint woman becomes a mother, her time and duties are centered primarily in the home with her husband and children, but a mother who gave service to some worthwhile cause before marriage, will have become conscious of her involvement with the community, and, in all probability, set aside time to engage as a volunteer, especially in programs which touch her children and community. Relief Society members are trained to give service. They are trained to act upon the words given Relief Society by the Prophet Joseph Smith "to assist by correcting the morals and strengthening the virtues of community life.'' They know that they do not live on an island. Then, when the children leave the home, the wife and mother, once again, can offer her volunteer services to that cause to which her training and interests lead her. As a member of the Church, she makes friends of others outside her own neighborhood. She further broadens her outlook on life, and may be an example to others through her dedication to service and her love for others. There is an urgent need, at this time, for volunteers in the hospitals, for volunteers in strengthening the Church's specialized social services, and for other programs mentioned. The great commandment is to love one's neighbor as oneself. One's neighbor may live next door or miles away. Volunteer service is soulsatisfying. Dedication to a worthwhile cause helps one to be about one's Father's business. —M. C.

WAITING IS WINTER Kathryn Kay Waiting is coma, Time of emptiness, The lonely interval between goodbye And the return which terminates heart-stress, Releasing tight-held tears too deep to cry. Waiting is the interim, the hyphen Connecting time-was with time-yet-to-be; The long, long days and nights when moments siphon More moments while we watch helplessly. But waiting, also, is remembering, Waiting is winter, thinking of the spring! 36 - JOIN MARCH OF DIMES George P. Voss Vice-President for Public Relations Love works both ways. The child born less than perfect gives his love as freely as all children do. In return, he needs the kind of love that means help and hope for his future. More than a quarter of a million babies born each year in this country need this special kind of love. They need expert medical care that can improve—and sometimes completely correct—almost eighty per cent of the serious conditions caused by birth defects. This is the kind of care available at more than seventy-five March of Dimes Birth Defects Centers throughout the United States. Early diagnosis and proper treatment are given—tender care for those who need it most. The child born less than perfect can be helped across the barriers of disability to find a full, productive life. Your March of Dimes contribution helps finance the Birth Defects Centers. You can help to care for the children who need your consideration and your remembrance. Your help is a measure of your love.

As Miss Gold fumbled into her hat and coat, she felt tears stinging her eyes. She imagined these children going to their homes and she ached to follow them. But she saw herself cramped in her musty apartment correcting notebooks —both from her own classes and from the classes of Miss Pool who had been ill for so many days. More at Christmas than at other times, Miss Gold reflected, life had seemed to pass her by. A boy she once loved had been killed in an automobile accident. Through the years no one else had seemed to want her for his wife. Last year her mother had died, joining her father, who had passed away many years before. Miss Gold pulled on her gloves and jostled the stacks of papers under her arms. If only she had 38 Marilyn McMeen Miller not promised Roberta Pool she would help her with the tedious notebooks. It seemed an extra burden just when her heart should be light and beating in time with "Jingle Bells" and "Deck the Halls With Boughs of Holly." | From the second story window of her apartment, Miss Gold saw the lights of the city sparkling far off over the hill. She stamped off her galoshes, turned up the radiator, and rubbed her hands. There was surely some way to make Christmas possible to bear this year. Finding it was the problem. She might take in a show—she might dine at the Lantern, her favorite place to eat. But then she was tired of always going alone. There was her new ward. She recalled they were planning some kind of MIA party. But there were no single people her age. She was almost forty. No one was really interested in a wornout schoolteacher. She shuddered to realize that the years had crept up on her this way. She brushed a shock of hair from her eyes and felt the dry skin of her forehead. Suddenly, her bones felt weak and tired, and she had tears in her eyes again. And the little apartment with not a Christmas light or decorated sprig in it, whirled in her consciousness. There must be some way she could begin! Where did other lonely people begin? There was at least one thing she could do. She could at least get a tree— even a little tree like the one her class had given to the needy family. Even if only for herself, it would help. Tomorrow was the day before Christmas, and most of the trees would be gone. There would probably be one or two straggly ones left, but size or beauty did not matter. Tonight she would see how many of her reports she could get done and then tomorrow she would get a tree. And a sudden thought warmed her even in her bitterness. Perhaps she could bake some cookies and take them and the notebooks and visit Miss Pool. She did not care much for the thin, wiry teacher who was so stern, and was avoided by many of the teachers; but it was something she could do for someone who needed her. Anyway, it was. A thought. After a light bow] of soup, Miss Gold sat grimly at her sitting room table and mechanically forced herself through the piles of words and pictures that lay before her. "And some people think a teacher is lucky because she gets vacations," she muttered once, and just then the telephone rang. "Hello, Sister Gold?" "Yes," she answered. It was Christmas Begins With a Tree someone from the ward. "TI know you don't get to come to Relief Society because you teach, but still we thought you wouldn't mind helping us out for the ward Christmas Eve night by bringing some cookies. Would you mind?" the voice on the end of the line seemed very friendly. "No. I'd be happy to help you." Miss Gold caught her own voice sounding grateful. "I was planning to make some cookies anyway. I'll just bake extra. Come to the party?" She hesitated. "Well, what time does it start? I was planning to do something else. I guess I could do it first, and come to the ward later. All right. T'll bring the cookies myself." Tuis first sign of human life warmed her. At least somebody cared that much, she thought. Correcting the notebooks was hard work. Her back ached and her hand was cramped. But this time she did not want to quit. She wanted to have a glorious Christmas Eve, knowing that Miss Pool's work, at least, was out of the way. And so, in the early hours of the morning, she finally closed the reports, laid down her red_ pencils, and breathed a sigh of relief. She was dead tired. But perhaps it had been worth it, even though she suspected the wiry old lady might not appreciate it. It was a little late in the morning when Miss Gold finally awakened without her alarm. During the night there had been a little skiff of snow, but now the sun was shining. She would be able to walk to get the tree; it was 39 January 1967 such a beautiful day! She decided she would bake the cookies first and then go. At the good smells of melting chocolate and toasting oatmeal and coconut, Miss Gold forgot that she was alone. Now if she had a tree, and watched a good television program, it would seem like Christmas. It was about five o'clock in the afternoon when all the cookies were finally baked, and the kitchen cleaned—and there hadn't yet been a moment to get a tree. It just didn't seem there would be time unless she drove to Miss Pool's and got the tree between going to Miss Pool's and the chapel. Or she might get the tree before going to Miss Pool's, and put it in the car. Sue decided the last course was best, so she boxed the cookies up and bundled Miss Pool's notebooks together and drove to look for her tree. She decided she would have to buy a string of lights. Miss Gold knew that most of the trees would be gone by now, but she forgot that so many of the lots which sold them would be closed. Time after time, she drove up to an empty lot littered with a few straggling branches. The lights were often out and the proprietors gone to spend the evening with their families. It surely looked like Christmas Eve. Even the stores were ending the season. All was quiet. She bought a string of lights and a box of 'tinsel and drove out of town a little distance to a lot she was sure would be open. She was lucky. The proprietor stood balancing from one leg to 40 the other, breathing big white puffs of warm breath into the cold air. "You're a little late, lady," he said. "'All we have are big ones. You want some boughs, lady?" "Say, I do believe we have one little pine left.'"' One of the men came up from a little shack at the side where the smoke spiraled into the air. One little pine? Her heart jumped. It seemed to be a silly thing, yet it made so much difference to her whether there would really be a Christmas in her life or not. "Oh, that will be perfect. I'll take it," she said. The tree was perfect. It was a beautiful and symmetrical, longneedled pine. It bounced around beautifully and smelled so good. It was going to seem like Christmas after all, and just in time. Joyously, she popped it in the back seat and drove to Miss Pool's. The small house that belonged to Miss Pool was completely dark. Not a light was visible anywhere, unless that weak faint glow from the back could be called a light. Betty Gold shuddered. Even her little apartment was better than this. One of the teachers had declined taking the faculty bulletins by, Miss Gold remembered. The nervous, sick woman was probably somewhere in the depths of that house, her same stern self. Betty was a little frightened, but she stepped up to ring the doorbell. There was no answer, and so she tried the door. To her surprise, it opened. "Anyone home?" From far in the back a weak voice called "Who is it?" Betty clutched the cookies and the notebooks under her arm. "Miss Gold. I've brought your notebooks, Miss Pool." "Well, come in, then. Don't leave the door open very long." The little woman was propped up against her pillows, reading under a low yellow light. "T've got your notebooks done, and I wanted to say Merry Christmas to you, too, Miss Pool." SoMEHow, Betty did not want to mention the cookies. Miss Pool looked so ill, as though she could not have eaten anything. Her face was drawn into tight lines. She looked tired and sad. "Thanks. Put the notebooks there."' It seemed a curt offering of appreciation after the work it had taken, but Betty promised herself she was not going to mind. "So it's Christmas again, is it?" Miss Pool asked weakly. "Not like the times I remember. I've been thinking about those years, Miss Gold. You're not as old as I am, and you don't remember when all the families got together —grandma—all the aunts—not a soul was left out—and there were trees, popcorn, carols, laughter, joy, everything." Miss Gold was about to say, "T think families still do get together," but she saw in the lonely old eyes a bright rim of tears. "My younger brother mentioned he'd come and bring his children to say Merry Christmas, but even they have forgotten," Miss Pool said. So there was something, after all, for Miss Pool for Christmas. Christmas Begins With a Tree Miss Gold thought of her own brother and his family so far away. "Are they coming Christmas Eve?" Betty asked, suddenly finding herself hopeful above any other thing that the young family would not forget. "Oh, You know young children don't care about the older generation anymore," Miss Pool said. Suddenly, Betty wanted to make it seem even more like Christmas for Miss Pool, because there seemed to be nothing but a double disappointment. And what if the family did come and the house was so drab? She thought of the tree. Of course. That was the logical thing. For only a brief moment did she hesitate. "Miss Pool, I have something out in the car—your brother's family would love it when they come oh and besides, I brought these cookies." The woman in the bed raised her eyes at Betty's sudden burst of good will. "Can you wait for me just one moment while I run out to the car?" "Cookies? Oh, why, yes, of course.... Thank you—how thoughtful!"' It took only a moment to drag the tiny pine into the bedroom and set it up on its little wooden stand, propping it with the sewing basket and some books. "Miss Gold—you needn't do that... Why, I haven't had a tree in a long time." Betty felt a sudden childish feeling of warmth rise from her heart to her cheeks. The woman's eyes were actually sparkling. "YT believe I have some orna- 41 January 1967 ments from years gone by," the sick woman said, almost trying to hide a new excitement she was ashamed of feeling. ''Down there in that lower drawer. No, not that in the chiffonier... Yes there." Just as the little tree, with its one string of lights, got a spattering of tinsel, the doorbell rang. It was Miss Pool's brother and his wife and three little girls, hesitant and quiet at the sight of the dark house and Miss Gold's presence at the door. Betty had never really been so happy to see anyone, and this feeling astonished her, because this was the family of someone else. She led them to the back room, and Miss Pool could not completely hide her joy and gratitude even though she tried to look stern as she said, '"'I thought you had forgotten me." The little girls immediately went over to the tree and tugged at their mother's hands. "TI didn't know Aunt Roberta would have a Christmas tree," one of them said questioningly. "Qh, it's so pretty." "Christmas came _ to house, after all." "We brought you some presents, Auntie." Betty's heart felt unusually warm and trembling, and she felt tears well up in her eyes. Without saying much, she would leave them now while Miss Pool was passing out the cookies. She moved toward the door and pulled on her coat and gloves. "Goodbye now," she said as inconspicuously as possible. "Oh, just a minute,'' Miss Pool said loudly, so that everyone in the warm room, standing around your 42 the bed piled with packages and the little glowing tree, turned to watch Miss Gold. "T just wanted to thank you, Miss Gold, for doing these notebooks. Nobody knows but a schoolteacher, I suppose, how much time and energy went into all of that. I know—and I am surely grateful. And thank you— well, just thank you for everything. I hope you can come again during the holidays." Betty's heart thudded, as she nodded goodbye to everyone and made her way out the door and -, eu Ai & — awe > re '': _ ad, <N +. " A J. Aa % into the crisp winter air. That was what she had needed—somehow to be able to give, and to have the someone who needed that giving, to appreciate it. Christmas might begin with a tree, but it was made up of love. Betty left the warm house with the laughter of the little girls and the sound of paper wrappings being torn off of packages. With a glad heart, she gathered _the other boxes of cookies on the front seat and drove to what she knew would be a most wonderful Christmas party, a wonderful Christmas Eve, and also a warm holiday. Unwelcome Caller Nancy M. Armstrong m Every muscle in my body screamed as I 'climbed out of bed. Never mind, the house was spotless. Windows shone, woodwork gleamed, curtains were crispy white. All the hard work of readying | for Christmas was done. Only pleasurable tasks remained. Last minute touches to decorations, packages, and food would consume the next two days. Then the transcendent day, with eighteen family members invited for dinner. Well, everything was under control. Suddenly, I smelled smoke. Throwing on a robe, I dashed to the kitchen. Thick smoke was issuing around every lid on the range. I tried every conceivable adjustment of the dampers, With each change, more smoke puffed out heavier and blacker. Opening the back door, I called to my husband who was in the coal shed filling buckets. The breeze, created by opening the door, wafted smoke into the other rooms. Originally, the old farm house we had purchased our first year of marriage, had doors to isolate each room. But we had had to be modern. In remodeling we removed most of the doors. The smoke surged through the dining room and into my newly decorated living room. When my husband came in, he said, '"'"Something is clogging the chimney or firebox. I'll have to lift the fire out to find out what it is." I moaned, but there was nothing else he could do. As he lifted the lids, fly ash and soot joined the smoke. After carrying the smoldering coal outside in a bucket, he came back to say he would have to take down the stovepipe. Warm fly ash and soot cascaded down the wall behind the stove as the pipe was removed. I opened the kitchen door and the back porch door so my husband could carry the pipe into the yard. I returned to survey my peed kitchen that resembled a a scene » from the Pa January 1967 "Last Days of Pompeii." Little swirls of soot whirled here and there on the floor. Fly ash was settling on chairs, table, cupboards, and refrigerator. I sat down at the table, put my head on my arms and wept. My husband came in to say, "'A little owl was clogging the pipe. He must have been asphyxiated last night while sitting on the chimney, and fell in." I who am a complete pushover for all animals and birds could feel no sympathy. I was drenched in self-pity. My husband put his arm around my shoulders. "At least I know what you need for Christmas now," he said. "What?" I asked through tears. "A guard for the top of the chimney to keep out unwelcome callers." I made no reply. "Oh, cheer up, honey," he said. "It could have been a lot worse." "How?" "Well he could have waited until Christmas Eve to play Santa." Oh, what a gruesome idea! With eighteen guests coming for dinner. My husband filled a bucket at the sink. "Where will I find a scrubbing brush and a box of detergent?' he asked. Raising my head, I managed a feeble smile. "T'll get into a work dress and be right back." Indeed things could have been a lot worse. LOVE'S MAGIC Leone W. Doxey A housekeeper is a homemaker if she shares her love; Tasks do not drag her down, her spirit soars above. Material things in her home become the tools at hand; They work magic when her love is in command. She greets the day with gladness, a song, and sunny smile, A table set attractively makes breakfast worthwhile; Her children go to school with their clothes washed clean, lIroned smooth, and mended with love in every seam. A token of her kindness, so thoughtful and sweet, Is often found in a lunch box—a special treat. Clean sheets on all the beds at night Tuck in love and say, ''Sleep tight.'' Oh, love is a wonderful, powerful thing; The woman who works with it hears life sing. 44 } SANDWICH SURPRISES Joyce B.

A Se a) a " ve ees ee, eee RT Agnes Kunz Dansie — Versatile Artist of Handicraft Agnes Kunz Dansie, Herriman, Utah, learned to quilt when she was fourteen years old. Her pieced quilts in Sunburst pattern and Double Wedding Ring are reminiscent of '"'economy craftsmanship'' of early days in the mountain valleys. Later, her satin quilts, in exquisite design and with fine and even stitchery, have won awards at many State and County Fairs. She has made more than one hundred quilts. To her skill in quiltmaking, Sister Dansie has added such crafts as crocheting, knitting, embroidery, making rugs and decorative pillows, baby bonnets and bootees, and sewing aprons and other clothing. As a sort of ''side hobby," as she calls it, she painted some lovely landscapes. Articles of her handicraft adorn the homes of her eight children and thirty-six grandchildren. She has now begun to make gifts for the great-grandchildren. She has served for twenty-three continuous years as Relief Society Magazine representative for her ward, and has never achieved less than a one hundred per cent record. One year she secured 118 per cent subscriptions. She is genealogical representative for her family and rejoices in record keeping and temple work. An admonition she gives for all Relief Society women, and for people everywhere: '"'When you are given a responsibility, do your best!'' 46 Synopsis: Julie Rideghaven, who has been attending school in California, is called back to her home in Sydney, Australia, because her fiancé Ron McLaren is lost in the bush. Julie's friend Betz Condon accompanies her, and the girls go with members of the Ridgehaven family on an expedition to search for Ron. Also in the party are Aunt Isabelle, who has been very ill; and Wally Ridgehaven, who becomes increasingly interested in Betz Condon. The women take over the housekeeping duties at the station, and the men set out in search of Ron. Julie is concerned over the strange actions of Ron's kelpie, and she feels that the dog knows something about Ron's strange disappearance. # Julie slept restlessly. She was fully awake standing at the window, as the first rays of the sun flickered through the branches of the big gum tree. The men had already gone. She heard them leave before she was out of bed. She bent her head against the window sill, a prayer in her heart. "Julie." Betz sat up in her bunk. "Please put your dressing gown on. It's cold as Christmas in here." Chapter 7 Tell Me of Love Rosa Lee Lloyd "T'll get dressed,' Julie said, reaching for her plaid skirt and bright yellow blouse. 'Casey Jones hasn't come home yet." "That dog!" Betz said. ""Don't worry. He'll come home when he gets good and hungry." "T'm counting on that—unless he followed the men. His big meal is in the morning, so he might come early. This time I'll put him on a leash. He won't get out of my sight again." 'He'll love that!'' Betz laughed. Julie went to the kitchen. Cleo was already there preparing breakfast. "Isabelle insists on coming to the table this morning," she told Julie, with a wondrous smile. ''She says she feels better than she has for ages. Funny, what love can do for a woman. It brought her back from the very edge of the grave, if you ask me. Oh, I hope she keeps getting better! I hope, I hope, I hope!'' she said fiercely. "She must not slip back, Julie. I couldn't bear it while Dr. George is away." Julie wanted to tell her what 47 = we January 1967 Dr. George had said about a regression, but she could not break her promise to him. Instead, she asked, "Did you know he sent for Carolyn Bridges? Wally is to meet her plane at noon." "Well, no, I didn't know that. But I'm glad. We'd better put that old couch on the veranda in Isabelle's room. Carolyn can sleep there beside her. That way we'll know she's watched over. Wally will have to cut a pile of wood for the stove in there. It gets cold at night. I imagine Isabelle and Carolyn will hit it off together. They're about the same age." "Oh, yes,' Julie murmured. "What kind of fruit or juice do we have, Aunt Cleo? Betz always likes fruit for breakfast." Cleo swung around from the stove. "You tell her Royal Highness to get out here and pitch in. We've dried apricots and dried apples that she can soak and stew." "But isn't there some tinned fruit?" Julie persisted. "T packed it all for the men," Cleo said. "It gets blistering hot out there. They need every little luxury I sent along. Wally can bring some things from the township this morning." "What about Aunt Isabelle? I promised Dr. George that she would have the very best. Fresh meat, too." Cleo nodded. "I've thought of that. You and I will go after some fresh meat this very day. We'll leave as soon as the nurse gets here. We'll take one of the old jeeps out where the sheep are grazing. How would you like a leg of lamb? Ummm. Smackin' good!" 48 "Perfect," Julie agreed. "Lamb is my very favorite." "Mine, too. That way we'll have some bones for Casey Jones." rt "Where is that kelpie?" Julie asked. "I've fixed his plate." "Beats me.' Cleo shook her head. "'He is a bit off lately. He's always been the smartest dog in this bush. Uncle Rufe said he could bring in a flock of sheep all by himself. It's not often a dog can do that!" "He's eight years old," Julie said. "Grandfather knows how Ron loves him. That's why he sent him here to the station, so Ron could see him often when he came up from Perth." Julie bit her lip. "I hope he didn't follow the men, Aunt Cleo. He could get lost if they didn't see him." "He might have gone," she answered. ''All I know for sure is that he's mighty troubled. He knows something's happened to Ron. Kelpies are gentle and peaceful unless something goes wrong. Then they go plumb daffy about it." During the morning the station house hummed with activity. Cleo had a job for everyone except Isabelle, and even she insisted on hemming a few flour sacks for tea towels. "Wally!" she called after him when he followed Betz out to the veranda. "We need heaps of wood cut. And Betz! There are piles of bugs to sweep out. Get busy, you two." "T was only telling her. Wally began. Cleo looked at him, her hands on her hips. "I know what you 99 were telling her, Wally Ridgehaven. Now, get going." Wally shrugged, rolling his eyes heavenward. "You should've been a drover," he said. But he went outside to chop the wood. "That adorable rascal,' Cleo said to Julie, who was washing the dishes. '"We love him to pieces, but we can't let him run us around. He reminds me of my Kip—red hair and tipsy smile. Gee, I'm lonely for those little pikers of mine." "Aunt Tricia will take good care of them," Julie assured her. "T know," Cleo said petulantly. "They won't even miss me." "You're their mother," Julie said. '"No one, not even wonderful Aunt Tricia, can take your place." Ceo looked at Julie. There were stars in her eyes. "'Righto!"' she said, with a sort of glory in her voice. "I'm their mother." She looked around briskly. '"'Now, let's see. We've got to get a hustle on. I'll start the bread while you mix up the biscuits. Call your friend Betz, and I will show her how to fix this dried fruit. Those men will be plain starved when they get back here. They'll be sick of tinned stuff." At eleven o'clock Wally and Betz started for the township to meet Carolyn. Cleo and Julie stood on the veranda and watched them ride off together, their red and gold hair bright and beautiful in the midday sunshine. "Can't stop the whirlwind," Cleo said. 'Say! Look up the road. I think that moving spot might be Casey Jones!"' Tell Me of Love It was. He was limping toward them, so weak and trembly he could hardly drag his feet. Julie ran toward him. She knelt down in the dust beside him. He was soaking wet with sweat, breathless and gaunt, and there was a dripping scarlet wound on his shoulder. "He's been in a fight,' Cleo said. "Probably with a dingo who's out there after our sheep! I'll get the wheelbarrow." They lugged him into the kitchen. Julie sat on the floor cradling his head in her lap. She bathed the wound with an antiseptic Aunt Cleo mixed up, then she coaxed him to swallow a bite or two of dog biscuit soaked in tinned milk. His brown eyes followed every move she made, pleading with her. He whimpered, trying to get up again. "What does he want, Aunt Cleo?" Julie asked. 'I know he's begging me for something." "l'm a bush woman, Julie. That gash on his shoulder was made by a dingo. And a big one. He wants us to follow him out there and shoot that dingo before he gets our sheep." "We'll go,' Jule said. "As soon as Carolyn gets here to stay with Aunt Isabelle." After they had lunched, Julie hurried to her room to put on her high boots as a protection against poisonous snakes. "Why can't Wally go, too?" Betz asked. ''He really wants to go. Cleo promised to show him how to shoot better." "He is needed here, Betz. Aunt Isabelle might need something from the township. And we'll need more wood for the stove." 49 January 1967 "Then let me go with you," Betz kept on. Julie shook her head. "Aunt Cleo has your work planned. You have to watch the bread dough. When it rises, knead it down again. Let it rise the second time, then put it in the oven. Don't let it get too brown. In the meantime, scrub out the cooler with hot water and bicarbonate of soda. We'll have meat and things to store there." "Ts that all?" Betz flared out. "I'm just another Cinderella!"' "You have to pay a price for your Prince Charming,' Julie said. "Life on a Ridgehaven property is no picnic, Betz. Remember, Grandfather warned you. Is it worth it?" A little smile curved Betz' mouth. "It is!" she said. '"Where is the scrub bucket?" "Same place we keep the broom," Julie answered. Carolyn Bridges came in as Betz went out. Her eyes had wonder in them. "IT can hardly believe it,'' she said, sitting on the edge of Julie's bunk. "Simply delighted. Your Aunt Isabelle is a _ different woman. I keep pinching myself to see if I'm really awake!" "T know," Julie smiled. "I feel the same way. Did Dr. George tell you what he hopes has happened?" "He wasn't very explicit in his re,' she answered. '"'But he did say it is either a regression or the results of cobalt treatments. We aren't ready to tell it yet. It will cause much comment." "IT haven't told a soul," Julie said. Then she added to herself: Maybe the prayers of the Ridge- 50 havens and Dr. George's love had something to do with it. But this idea was only for her secret heart. "Guess I'm ready," she said, putting her rifle under her arm and pointing it downward. "Take care,' Carolyn said. "I wonder if I'll ever outgrow bens afraid of guns?" "It's being used to them," Julie told her. "My father taught me to use a rifle before I was nine years old. We lived way out in the Dead Heart country. A rifle was part of our way of life. Now prepare Aunt Isabelle and all of you for a beaut dinner." "T'll do that,"' Carolyn laughed, as she got to her feet. "We'll be ready for a beaut dinner." Casey Jones leaped to his feet the minute he saw Julie and Cleo ready to leave. He whirled and whimpered, pawing at the door. Then he pulled at Julie's boots. "We'll take him," Cleo said, flatly. 'I've a hunch he can lead us to that dingo. We've got to get him. One dingo means murder for our sheep. You have your grandfather's rifle, so I'll take Geoffrey's. It's the very latest, newer than John's. Now let's check. We have our water bags filled, plenty of bullets, and extra petrol." Aunt Isabelle came to, the doorway, looking radiant in her sky-blue dressing gown. She hugged each of them. "Good luck, dear ones," she said in her gentle, cultured voice. Casey Jones settled down on the floor of the jeep, dozing contentedly for several miles. Julie saw the fields of everlasting flowers before Cleo did. They were a rainbow of color and beauty that stabbed her heart. "Let's stop, Aunt Cleo,' she coaxed. '"'Ron told me of these flowers in his last letter. I want a bouquet." | "So do I," Cleo said. ""We pass Uncle Rufe's grave. I'd like to stop there and leave them on it."' Casey Jones stayed in the jeep while they picked armfuls of the flowers. He barked several times as though impatient at the delay, but when they returned he lay down contentedly again. "Good kelpie,' Julie crooned to him. A few miles farther on, they stopped near the roadside and Cleo trudged through the dust and bush to a rock-covered grave with an elaborate bronze headstone. Julie could not read the inscription from where she sat in the jeep. "He was the only parent I ever knew," Cleo said when she took the wheel again. ''My parents died in a willie-willie. Uncle Rufe was kind, courageous, and the best sheepman in the country. He worked as boss of the shearing sheds for your grandfather for forty years. Every drover and every shearer in all this area wanted to work for him. I used to go with him at shearing time and Tell Me of Love cook for the men. I met John at the station back there. One look between us, and we were lost to each other. John knew he couldn't consult his father about our marriage. He would have said no—that his son could not marry the station cook. So John and I[ went down to Perth and were married. Now we have been through the New Zealand Temple." "What did your Uncle Rufe say?" Julie wanted to know. "Very little,' Cleo answered, her mouth twisting. "He knew it could mean his job with your grandfather. But he sat there in the kitchen that night that I told him and his eyes had a dreamy, faraway look as if he was thinking of someone I knew nothing about." "If it means your happiness," he said, "then marry him. You'll be a fine wife. I'd say John Ridgehaven, Junior, is a lucky boy to have your love. That's all I'll ever say to his father. If he gives me the sack for that — well — there are other sheep yards in Australia. He doesn't own them all. Not quite!" "He didn't give Uncle Rufe the sack, and when he was killed in another willie-willie that hit out here five years ago, your grandfather came all the way from Sydney for the funeral. He brought that headstone you see engraved in bronze letters: 'Rufe Riley Quinn, for loyal and outstanding service'. Look, now we turn off at the next cattle guard. The sheep are out there about twenty miles." "There it is!" Julie said a few seconds later. When Cleo turned the jeep, 51 January 1967 Casey Jones leaped up, barking and growling. He pushed against them holding them in the jeep. "That kelpie is telling us something,' Cleo said, puzzled. ''Let's stay on this road north and see if he keeps quiet." Casey Jones settled down again, and for several miles he lay with his head on his paws. "There must be another crossing ahead," Cleo said. 'Watch him." WHEN they reached it, Casey Jones bounced to his feet, climbing over Julie, pawing at the door. "This looks like a dead-end trail,' Cleo said. "But we'll follow him anyway." Julie opened the door. Casey Jones leaped out, ran up the trail, scarcely limping, then he ran back to them barking fiercely. "We'll stay inside the jeep," Cleo said, "and follow him. That poor old kelpie is worked up about something." They drove a mile from the highway over a bumpy dirt road. Casey Jones ran on ahead, then whirled and ran back to make sure they were following him. "Look," Julie cried out. '"There is a mob of kangaroos. Is that why he brought us here?" "T don't think so," Cleo said, her voice tense. 'Don't let that kelpie out of your sight. He knows where he is taking us." "But maybe we should get a kangaroo," Julie insisted. "Later," she said. ''Not now." Julie saw the danger sign before Cleo did. It was a five-foot plank of wood stuck down through the middle of a big bush to hold it against the wind. 52 "Danger. Blow-hole country" was painted on it in red letters. Julie's heart beat up into her throat. Blow-hole country! Cleo stopped the car. They got out without speaking. Each knew what the other was thinking. Casey Jones whirled and came back. He nuzzled his head against Julie, licking her hands, wagging his tail. They took their rifles and trudged through the bush, following the kelpie. Cautiously. Silently. A few yards away he stopped, body tense. Then he got down on his paws, crawling forward, inching his way toward the edge of a crater-like hole. "Stop!" Cleo warned Julie. "Don't walk there. If you have to follow him—if you think Ron is in that hole, then get down and crawl the way Casey did. That way you can feel with your 'fingertips if the earth is solid. Look — over there. That edge is broken off. Someone walked' too close and tumbled in!" Julie looked in the direction Cleo pointed out. There was a huge bush overhanging the hole. A piece of bright blue and white shirting was caught on a stiff branch. A cry tore from her heart. It was a piece of the shirt she had sent Ron for his birthday! She knelt down, then lay flat, holding her rifle above the ground. She lay flat as Casey Jones had done, crawling toward the hole. She gazed down into the darkness, sobbing: 'Oh, Aunt Cleo! He's down there. That's a piece of his shirt on the bush, oh, Aunt Cleo!" ) (To be concluded) FROM THE FIELD Relief Society Activities All material submitted for publication-in this department should be sent through the stake Relief Society presidents, or mission Relief Society supervisors.

Smith, member, General Board of Relief Society; Una H. Wuthrich, First Counselor; Lucille S. Binns, Secretary-Treasurer; Melba Johnson, member, Cache Stake Relief Society board. Sister Gibson reports: " 'Music is the speech of the angels,' was expressed by Carlyle, and was affirmed by the voices of the Cache Stake Singing Mothers in their formal concert of joyful and spiritual music. 'Singing Into Spring' was the theme of the pre-Easter concert directed by Bernice C. Baugh, in which 130 women participated. Accompanists were Margene Liljenquist and Leona M. Pritchett. Seven ward choruses prepared two numbers each, with their own directors and accompanists, and the combined wards sang three selections. An inspirational narration was composed and spoken between numbers by Carma C. Spencer. Guest soloist was Fredonna Dixon, accompanied by Neva Simonsen. A vocal solo was sung by Camille S. Zahmel of Cache Stake. A violin duet was played by Lois Brown and Mira F. Baker, and a vocal sextette was also featured." 53 January 1967 Monument Park West Stake (Salt Lake City, Utah) Singing Mothers Present Concert, April 2, 1966 Clarice M. Cooper, President, Monument Park West Stake Relief Society, reports. "A very impressive spring concert was presented by the Singing Mothers on Saturday, April 2, 1966. A variety of music was beautifully sung, some spiritual, some patriotic, and some light. Outstanding special numbers ' were given by Blanche Christensen, soprano, and Beryl Smiley, contralto. A trio, composed of Carol Gray, Marie English, and Florence Parsons, accompanied by Elnora Gwynn,-and a reading by Nedra Potter completed the delightful program. "Hazel Perry, stake music director, and Lenore Grundman, stake organist, spent many hours organizing and directing the program, and the Singing Mothers were faithful in coming to rehearsals, which was apparent in the excellence of the performance. After the program, cookies made by the stake board members, and punch were served. "The concert was given as a means of making a little money for the stake Relief Society, with the wards receiving twenty-five per cent of the money from the tickets which they were able to sell. Everyone was cooperative and appreciative, and we feel that the performance was highly successful, both in promoting sisterhood, and in helping the stake financially." North Sacramento Stake (California) Presents Musical Dramatization "The Journey," April 1, 1966 Freda Thayne, President, North Sacramento Stake Relief Society, reports: '"*The Journey' was used with permission from Melvina Allen and Geraldine D'Addabbo, East Mesa Stake (Arizona), who wrote the original script. It portrays the progression of one of the daughters of our Heavenly Father from pre-existence into mortality and back into eternal life. Our North Sacramento Stake Singing Mothers (approximately fifty) sang eleven selections, under the direction of Jeannine Eborn and Lynda Bradley of the Relief Society Stake Board. Among the selections rendered were the following: "To a Child,' 'Stand in Holy Places,' 'Oh, That I Were an Angel,' and 'Eternal Life.' Members of the stake were invited to bring their families, and the program was spiritual and uplifting for all. Approximately 400 attended."

Nettie E. Stout, President, Liberty Stake Relief Society, reports: "The picture represents a display of beautiful articles completed by a Relief Society where the majority of the members are seventy years or older. In the past five and a half years this society has made and sold 300 quilts, thus keeping alive the art of quilting. Besides Utah and the neighboring states, these quilts have gone to Japan, Germany, Old Mexico, New Zealand, Hawaii, Arizona, California, Michigan, and New York. The unique part about this quilting society is that the work of cutting, appliquéing, sewing, and preparation prior to the actual quilting, is done by homebound sisters. They prepare ahout, three quilts a month, and through these assignments fulfill the desire to be needed and wanted. Other homebound sisters crochet and embroider for the _ society. Through the leadership of Sister Richins, this ward organization has grown to a membership of 105. And to visit their meetings is to experience the true love of sisterhood." 54 January 1967 Oakland-Berkeley Stake (California) Presents 'Relief Society in Panorama'"' May 21, 1966 "Woman Suffrage - 1888,' presented by Berkeley Ward, left to right: Faye Lloyd; Margaret Williams; Roma Sabine; Afton Whitehead; Pat Moore; Marjean Moore; Gerry Cook (hidden); Annette Jensen. Margaret S. Fife, President, Oakland-Berkeley Stake Relief Society, reports: "T am sure that it is the general opinion of those who saw 'Relief Society in Panorama," which concluded our year's activities, that it was undoubtedly one of the finest productions which has ever been a part of the Oakland-Berkeley Stake Relief Society program. The cast of more than 200 included members of all the wards in the stake, together with the stake Singing Mothers chorus, which made it possible for all of our sisters who wished to do so to participate in one way or another. 'Relief Society in Panorama' had its inspiration at the 1965 Relief Society Annual General Conference, from the tableau presented in the Presidencies Department. We decided that the highlights of the Relief Society history had great possibilities of not only being presented historically and authentically, but also in an interesting and entertaining way, depicting the pathos, the inspiration, the hardships, and the progress of the Society. We were able to highlight the organization in Nauvoo, the death of the Prophet, the crossing of the plains, and the establishment of Relief Society in Utah. We pictured the sisters' part in the suffrage movement, and by means of a delightful fashion parade, depicting their part in the Utah Territorial Centennial Fair. When we reached the year 1907 our story featured the organization of Relief Society in California, in the Oakland Branch. From that year until 1966, the highlights concerned the development of Relief Society in our own stake. The pageant was written and coordinated by Margaret S. Fife, with Annabell W. Hart and Mary R. Burton in charge of the music." 56 Notes From the Field Swiss Mission Relief Society Holds Convention Zollikofen, Switzerland, June 17-18, 1966 Front row, standing, left to right, beginning fourth from the left: Christian Abbuhl, of the Bern-Luzern District; Hermine Trauffer, wife of the Temple President Walter E.

Sister Mabey reports: "The picture was taken in front of the Swiss Temple in Zollikofen. This is the Bern-Luzern District, the only one now in the mission. Every other branch is now included in the Swiss Stake." "About eighty Relief Society members attended. Some very inspirational] talks were given by the sisters and by representatives of the district presidency. Then the group was divided for class work. The meals were prepared and served by the different branches. A very lovely concert was presented in the evening by the Singing Mothers, with President Mabey as speaker. "The next morning was an interesting one. Some of our good brethren had put up booths in the cultural hall, and Saturday morning the sisters were busy decorating the booths and arranging the displays of handwork that had been made for the occasion. After lunch, the bazaar went into full swing, and the sisters were happy with buying and selling, and many women from the neighborhood were present. In the evening there was food for all, and an interesting short program concluded the activities." 57 Lesson Department SPIRITUAL LIVING The Doctrine and Covenants Elder Roy W. Doxey Lesson 79—The Millennium (Text: Doctrine and Covenants, Section 101:23-42) Northern Hemisphere: First Meeting, April 1967 Southern Hemisphere: September 1967 Objective: The Latter-day Saint woman makes individual preparation for INTRODUCTION In the first part of Section 101, the Lord said that because of the transgressions of the saints, they were persecuted in Jackson County, Missouri. Despite the fact that the saints had been driven from the land of their inheritance, the Lord said that they would return to build up the waste places of Zion. (D&C 101:17-18.) In the meantime, the saints were to gather together in stakes that the strength of Zion might be increased. Since 1833, when the saints left Jackson County, the number of stakes has multiplied many times over. At this writing, there are over 400 of these territorial divisions in the Church. These "holy places" are to be places of refuge against the storm of calamities which will befall the 58 participation during the millennial reign. Earth in the last days. (Ibid., 20- 23.) THE COMING OF CHRIST While the saints are established in the stakes of Zion, they are to prepare for the Savior's second coming. The covering between his abode in the heavens and the earth will be removed and "all flesh shall see [him] together." (Ibid., 101:23.) Class Discussion Why do you believe that the second coming of Christ will be a real, actual event? The coming of Christ will be a literal appearance as a personage of flesh and bones. When he ascended into the heavens after his final instructions to his apostles, he promised that he would come in like manner as they had seen him go into heaven. (Acts 1:11.) Jesus was resurrected, his spirit being re-united with his physical body which had been placed in the sepulcher following his death. (Luke 24.) He is today enthroned in the heavens having the same body that he took into the heavens. (D&C 49:6; 130: 22.) On March 7, 1831, the Lord had said that he would come with his holy angels in great power and glory, and he who would not watch for his coming would be cut off. (Ibid., 45:44.) As we take the scriptures literally in regard to Christ's personal appearance, so also we should remember that his coming will be attendant with great destruction. The brightness of his glory will even surpass the brightness of the sun. (Ibid., 133:49.) The wicked will enter the spirit world to be judged according to their works. (D&C 29:9-10; 133: 64; 76:106-112.) The destruction of the wicked at the second coming of Christ is referred to in the scriptures as the end of the world. (Pearl of Great Price, Joseph Smith 1:4, 31; SMITH, JOSEPH FIELDING, Compiler: Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 1956, pp. 100-101.) When that time comes, the millennial reign of Christ will commence. (D&C 29:10-11.) In some scriptures the condition of the earth is referred to as "a new heaven and a new earth" (Isa. 65:17; RICHARDS AND LITTLE Compendium, pp. 185-186 [out of print]). Whereas the present environment of the earth is known as telestial, during the millennium it will be terrestrial. (SMITH, JOSEPH FIELDING: Doctrines of Lesson Department Salvation, 1:82.) The tenth Article of Faith describes the millennial condition of the earth as "naradisiacal."' This word, given by the Prophet Joseph Smith, suggests a beautiful garden; that is, the earth will become as it was before the fall of Adam. (Ibid., pp. 84-85.) THE CELESTIALIZED EARTH After the earth has served its purpose as the habitat for mortal man, it will undergo a further transformation known as celestialization. Then it will be like a sea of glass having the properties of the Urim and Thummim. By this means knowledge of lower kingdoms than the celestial will be revealed. (D&C 130:9.) This condition is not the same as during the millennium. MILLENNIAL PEOPLE Some members of the Church have an erroneous idea concerning the people who will dwell on the earth during the millennium. Mortals will live during this time. The scriptures speak of a resurrection at the time of the second coming of Christ and indicate that people will be caught up to meet him. It does not follow that the mortals caught up to meet him or those who are not destroyed at his coming will undergo the resurrection. (Ibid., 88: 97-98.) Mortals will live on the earth and follow the same pattern of life that we do now. Isaiah said that people will eat of the fruit of the vine and inhabit houses. (Isaiah 65:21-23.) Children are mentioned in the scriptures as living also. (Isaiah 11:6; 65:20; D&C 63:49-51.) President Joseph Fielding 59 January 1967 Smith has said that honorable people who presently live the terrestrial law will have the right to life then. It will not be only faithful members of the Church who will survive the destruction before and at the Lord's coming. There will be millions of people, Catholics, Protestants, agnostics, Mohammedans, people of all classes, and of all beliefs, still permitted to remain upon the face of the earth, but they will be those who have lived clean lives, those who have been free from wickedness and corruption. All who belong, by virtue of their good lives, to the terrestrial order, as well as those who have kept the celestial law, will remain upon the face of the earth during the millennium. Eventually, however, the knowledge of the Lord will cover the earth as waters do the sea. But there will be need for the preaching of the gospel, after the millennium is brought in, until all men are either converted or pass away. In the course of the thousand years all men will either come into the Church, or kingdom of God, or they will die and pass away. In that day there will be no death until men are old (Doctrines of Salvation 1:86-87). Among those of "all beliefs' mentioned by President Smith will be those who "knew no law" or the heathen nations. (D&C 45:54.) These will enjoy the blessings of the millennium. If among these nations there are those, however, who will not come up to worship, they will suffer "the judgments of God, and must eventually be destroyed from the earth" (SMITH, JOSEPH FIELDING, Compiler: Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 1956, page 269). This is in accord with what the Prophet Zechariah said of the nations who were left of those who came up to fight 60 against Jerusalem. (Zech. 14:16- 19.) On the other hand, it is not to be expected that all Latter-day Saints will survive the great desolations that visit the earth before and at the second coming of Christ. The Prophet Joseph Smith said: I explained concerning the coming of the Son of Man; also that it is a false idea that the Saints will escape all the judgments, whilst the wicked suffer; for all flesh is subject to suffer, and "the righteous' shall hardly escape;"' still many of the Saints will escape, for the just shall live by faith; yet many of the righteous shall fall a prey to disease, to pestilence, etc., by reason of the weakness of the flesh, and yet be saved in the kingdom of God. So that it is an unhallowed principle to say that such and such have transgressed because they have been preyed upon by disease or death, for all flesh is subject to death; and the Savior has said, "Judge not, lest ye be judged" (SMITH, JOSEPH FIELDING, Compiler: Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 1956, pp. 162-163). Among the people who will live on the earth during the millennium will be the lost tribes. They will return from the land of the north sometime near or at the second coming of Christ. The destructions of the last days will prepare the way, said the Prophet Joseph Smith, "for the return of the lost tribes from the north country." (DHC 1:815.) We know from the scriptures that the Savior visited them and taught them the gospel, and that they have their own scriptures. (3 Nephi, chapters 15 and 16.) They shall come to the Latter-day Saints and there receive their blessings. (D&C 133:26-34; 3 Nephi 21:26; Ether 13:11.) DEATH Class Discussion Wherein is death during the millennium different from death today? (See D&C 101:29.) Separation from loved ones today brings sorrow, but those who die during the millennium "shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye, and shall be caught up, and his [their] rest shall be glorious" (verse 31). The changing of the body will be from mortality to immortality or resurrection. It is said of children that they will "grow up without sin unto salvation" (D&C 45:58). ANIMALS AND MAN The millennial period is known as a period of peace. ''And in that day the enmity of man, and the enmity of beasts, yea, the enmity of all flesh, shall cease from before my face' (D&C 101:26; Isaiah 11:6-9). With Satan's power absent and honorable people inhabiting the earth, war shall cease. (Micah 4:4.) Men will convert their military equipment into instruments of peace and productivity. (Isaiah 2:4.) With the Spirit of the Lord upon the earth in rich abundance, the present enmity existing among animals will cease, and man and animal will also be at peace. INCREASED KNOWLEDGE One of the blessings to be received during the millennium is the understanding of many mysteries which have perplexed man. Class Discussion What has the Lord promised us regarding knowledge of the origin of man? Lesson Department It is promised that knowledge concerning man and the earth will be increased greatly. By revelation, men will know the truth regarding man's creation. Yea, verily I say unto you, in that day when the Lord shall come, he shall reveal all things— Things which have passed, and hidden things which no man knew, things of the earth, by which it was made, and the purpose and the end thereof— Things most precious, things that are above, and all things that are beneath, things that are in the earth, and upon the earth, and in heaven (D&C 101:32-34). As a part of the restoration of the fulness of the gospel, it was prophesied that there would be a "restitution of all things" spoken of by the mouths of the holy prophets since the world began. (Acts 3:19-21.) Among these prophecies is the restoration of the sealed portion of The Book of Mormon plates which contain a history of the world from the beginning to the end. These plates will not be revealed during the time of wickedness and abominations, but when the Lord reveals "all things" during the millennium. (2 Nephi 27:7, 8, 10, 11, 22.) Great knowledge has ever been promised those who seek sincerely, and individuals during this period will receive whatsoever they ask. (D&C 101:27; 112:10; 42:68; James 1:5.) The principle upon which this blessing is received is given in Section 88:63- 65. Men today, as well as during the millennium, should ask only for what the Spirit prompts them. PURPOSE OF THE MILLENNIUM There will be a great many of the Father's children who will 6] January 1967 not have received salvation when the millennium is begun. Men will continue to be taught the truth and be capable of exercising their free agency. Class Discussion How will our genealogical research today help us to fulfill one of the principal purposes of the millennium? One of the principal purposes of the thousand-year reign of peace is to perform temple work for those who are eligible for the fulness of the gospel. From the other side of the veil will come messengers that will provide mortals with names of those who, having accepted the gospel in the spirit world, are eligible to receive the ordinances of the temple. Expressed in the language of President Brigham Young, we read:. Before this work is finished, a great many of the Elders of Israel in Mount Zion will become pillars in the Temple of God, to go no more out: they will eat and drink and sleep there; and they will often have occasion to say— "Somebody came into the Temple last night; we did not know who he was, but he was no doubt a brother, and told us a great many things we did not before understand. He gave us the names of a great many of our forefathers that are not on record, and he gave me my true lineage and the names of my forefathers for hundreds of years back. He said to me, You and I are connected in one family: there are the names of your ancestors; take them and write them down, and be baptised and confirmed, and save such and such ones, and receive the blessings of the eternal Priesthood for such and such an individual, as you do for yourselves." This is what we are going to do for the inhabitants of the earth (Journal of Discourses 6:295). RESURRECTED SAINTS Because the millennium will be 62 a period of the resurrection, it is improbable that resurrected beings will continue upon the earth as do mortals. Christ will reign personally upon the earth. About this subject, the Prophet Joseph Smith said: °.. Christ and the resurrected Suits will reign over the earth during the thousand years. They will not probably dwell upon the earth, but will visit it when they please, or when it is necessary to govern it (DHC V: 212). During that reign "judgment will be administered in righteousness; anarchy and confusion will be destroyed, and 'nations will learn war no more'" (DHC V: 63). TWO CAPITALS During the millennial period there will be two capitals on the earth. These will be the Zion on the American Continent and the Old Jerusalem on the Eastern Continent. (Isaiah 2:3.) THE SALT OF THE EARTH What manner of saints should we be to inherit the blessings of the millennium, if alive when it is ushered in? The early saints were reminded that when they accepted the everlasting gospel, they became the salt of the earth and the savor of men. (D&C 101:39.) President Brigham Young said: All Latter-day Saints enter the new and everlasting covenant when they enter this Church. They covenant to cease sustaining, upholding and cherishing the kingdom of the Devil and the kingdoms of this world. They enter the new and everlasting covenant to sustain the Kingdom of God and no other kingdom. They take a vow of the most solemn kind, before the heavens and earth, and that, too, upon: the validity of their own salvation, that they will sustain truth and righteousness, instead of wickedness and falsehood, and build up the Kingdom of God, instead of the kingdoms of this world (Discourses of Brigham Young, 1941 edition, page 160). Salt was used among the Lord's people anciently as a preservative and also in animal sacrifices. (Lev. 2:13; Ezek. 43:24; Mark 9:49-50.) It was a symbol of the covenant made between God and his people. (Lev. 2:13; Num. 18:19; 2 Chron. 13:5.) When salt is used to represent a people, it means that they will be an influence in carrying forward the truth of the gospel and thus become the savor of men. But if they are represented to be as salt that loses its savor, they will be cast out of the kingdom. (D&C 101:40.) To break the commandments brings a loss of effectiveness with others and a loss of the spirit, and eventual denial of the faith. HE THAT EXALTETH HIMSELF Some of the children of Zion had sinned against their covenants and were cast out of Jackson County, Missouri. Transgressions bring chastisement. (Jbid., 101:41.) He that exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that abaseth himself shall be exalted (Verse 42). The Lord told the saints in this revelation (101) that they did not serve him well during their peace and prosperity, and, therefore, they lost their present inheritance. (Verses 6-8.) In this Lesson Department way they exalted themselves above the Lord's commandments. One of the most serious sins is to become a law unto oneself. To consider that one is beyond receiving counsel from those in authority, constitutes exalting oneself. (D&C 63:55.) SHALL BE ABASED The person who exalts himself lacks humility. Perhaps the instruction of the Lord to Martin Harris might serve to explain what is necessary to become humble. In order for Martin Harris to see the plates of The Book of Mormon, he was told that he must no longer exalt himself but become humble. Behold, I say unto him [Martin Harris], he exalts himself and does not humble himself sufficiently before me; but if he will bow down before me, and humble himself in mighty prayer and faith, in the sincerity of his heart, then will I grant him a view of the things which he desires to see (D&C 5:24). Another requisite for greatness in the kingdom of God is to become the servant of all. (Mark 10:43-44.) Submitting to the will of the Lord is true humility. ''Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time" (I Peter 5:6). FOR CONSIDERATION Do you think a discussion with your family on some of the qualities needed to attain greatness in the kingdom of God would be productive? How, as a family, can we prepare for the second coming of Christ? How can we, as mothers and wives, support. The Priesthood in the great genealogical program? 63 VISITING TEACHER MESSAGE Truths to Live By From the Doctrine and Covenants Alice Colton Smith Message 79—"As Oft As Thine Enemy Repenteth of the Trespass Thou Shalt Forgive Him, Until Seventy Times Seven (D&C 98:40). Northern Hemisphere: First Meeting, April 1967 Southern Hemisphere: September 1967 Objective: To teach us that we should never withhold forgiveness. It was the hour of agony, of crucifixion, of cruel death. To watch him die was tragedy to the few who stood by the Son of God. Only days before crowds had strewn his path with palm branches and hailed him "King of Israel." Now, forsaken by that fickle throng, condemned by the leaders of his people, he hung in anguish between two_ thieves. Then said Jesus, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34). In the midst of his torture, he was filled with compassion for those inflicting on him physical death. He concentrated not on his own pain but upon the needs of those who trespassed against him. In him charity never failed. Centuries later and now triumphant, the resurrected Lord, still counseling forgiveness, said, " of you it is required to forgive all men... Let God judge... For he that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin" (D&C 64:10, 11, 9). In August 1833, the saints were soon to know persecution and death. In preparing them, the Lord said, '"'As oft as thine enemy 64 repenteth of the trespass thou shalt forgive him, until seventy times seven" (D&C 98:40). Someone hurts our feelings. Shall we strike back? Shall we nurture a grudge? Someone gossips about us. Shall we return slander for slander? Someone takes advantage of us, cheats us, ruins our business or career. What shall we do? God is the same "yesterday, today, and forever' (D&C 20: 12). Long ago in Judaea, Solomon said, "'Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth"' (Proverbs 24:17). During his earthly ministry, the Lord taught, "Love your enemies" and "do good to them that hate you" (Matthew 5:44). In a memorable speech to the Relief Society, the Prophet Joseph Smith said, ""We have not yet forgiven them [sinners] seventy times seven, as our Savior directed; perhaps we have not forgiven them once" (SMITH, JOSEPH FIELDING, Compiler: Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, The Deseret News Press, Salt Lake City, 1956, p. 238). All of us are sinners in some degree. All of us need forgiveness from our Father in heaven. We should, therefore, pray daily: "forgive us our trespasses, aS we forgive those who trespass against us" (Joseph Smith's Inspired Version of Matthew 6:13). In cultivating forgiveness and understanding of others, we open our souls to the greatness of love and, thereby, become eligible for Lesson Department the forgiveness the Lord has promised us. Only then can we truly become generous, loving, hospitable, helpful, good neighbors, and loving, tolerant, patient friends. Forgetting our selfish interests, we can seek out our enemies, forgive them, and try to make them our friends. HOMEMAKING——Development Through Homemaking Education Celestia J. Taylor Keeping Records Northern Hemisphere: Second Meeting, April 1967 Southern Hemisphere: September 1967 Objective: To show the importance of keeping home-management records. INTRODUCTION During the past few months the homemaking discussions have been concerned with the importance of family financial planning in its various applications to family life and living. These have involved the keeping of certain financial records: specifically, some form of budgeting which would enable the family to work toward the realization and attainment of its goals, and ambitions. Financial records, however, are not the only ones with which the family should be concerned. The management of a home is similar in many ways to the management of a business. Like a business, a family has important documents, valuable assets and _ securities, and other things of significant value to its members. Since memory cannot be relied upon to supply usable or dependable records, these, of necessity, should be preserved and made a matter of written record. To Discuss Almost every mother, at one time or another in her life, is confronted by such questions as: 1. Are you prepared to take care of the family business affairs if anything happened to your husband? 2. In case of emergency, do you know the blood type of each member of the family? 3. Can you furnish the facts relative to your children's health status if it were necessary to do so? 4. Do you know what your family assets are, and can you produce the deeds or certificates to your holdings? WHAT RECORDS SHOULD A FAMILY KEEP? Assuming that the homemaker is convinced of the importance and advantage of keeping records, she, as well as her husband, needs to know what kind of records are 65 January 1967 of importance to the family. She and her husband need to know what they own, where important documents and _ securities are kept, and how these can be preserved for the benefit and protection of the family. Following is a suggested list which might be of value in the keeping of homemanagement records. I. Family Documents Important family documents and papers should be kept in good form and readily available to the heads of the family. The following are usually included: a. Social Security cards b. Birth certificates of all family members c. Church records: baptisms, ordinations, positions held, etc. D. Marriage license e. Wills of both husband and wife II. Investments Every family should be aware of its assets, as well as its liabilities, and keep a record of them. A. Property owned, and certificates or deeds indicating ownership. B. Bank accounts, including location of banks and administrators thereof. 1. Checkbook stubs. 2. Receipts for payments. C. Government bonds and certificates. Stock III. Benefits An important part of family record keeping is the knowledge which it gives to the members of the benefits which accrue to them from their holdings. A. Insurance: Premium payments and dates when due. 1. Health insurance 2. Fire insurance 3. Other b. Pensions. C. Profit-sharing plans, if any. IV. Health Records Every mother needs to know the answers when she is confronted with 66 questions concerning the health rec-. Ord of members of her family. A. Immunizations: dates and kinds b.. Diseases, predispositions, susceptibilities, and allergies c. Doctors and dentists consulted d. Medicine prescribed: usage, prescription dates, etc. E. Blood type of each family member V. Calendar Record of Events Every family, of necessity, keeps a calendar record of daily, weekly, or monthly events. A. School functions b. Wedding and social engagements c. Special events d. Routine appointments VI. Personal Family Records How much fun it is to keep a personal record of each child as he or she comes into the family circle, beginning with the first baby picture and following through with each important event which occurs from then on. Such a record instills in the child a personal interest in keeping up his own record, and preserves in the family a feeling of loyalty and pride of achievement. A. Book of Remembrance 'b. Individual scrapbooks and _ records of achievement c. Photograph albums d. Family travels and vacations e. Family interests and hobbies SUMMARY No matter how interesting and absorbing this matter of record keeping may become, it is important to remember that records are not to be considered as an end in themselves, but as a means for realizing the essential goals and desires of a family. They should be looked upon and used as valuable tools in the intelligent execution of the business of home management, which is of as vital concern to every family as any other part of the business of living. SOCIAL RELATIONS—On Earth and in Heaven Alberta H. Christensen Lesson 4—"When Ye Do What | Say" (D&C 82:10) Reference: ''On Earth and In Heaven"' (Melchizedek Priesthood Manual, 1967 - Lessons 23 and 26) Northern Hemisphere: Third Meeting, April 1967 Southern Hemisphere: September 1967 Objective: To point out that personal commitments are involved in the ordinance of setting-apart for service in the Church and in partaking of the sacrament of the Lord's Supper. FOLLOW-UP If there is a convert member in the class, suggest that she relate what baptism by the restored authority of the Priesthood means to her. Otherwise, have a member relate briefly the reaction of her family members to the responsibilities involved in the ordinance of baptism. INTRODUCTION This lesson continues discussion of gospel law as manifest in revealed ordinances performed through the authority of the Priesthood. In general, the ordinances considered are familiar to Relief Society women; so familiar, that certain aspects relative to their importance and function as a binding covenant, often may be overlooked. The following questions relate to the two ordinances considered in this lesson: (1) How may the ordinance of setting-apart benefit a woman who has been appointed to render Church service? (2) How is the ancient law of sacrifice associated with the sacrament of the Lord's Supper? (3) What personal commitments are involved in this ordinance? SETTING-APART Setting-apart is a phrase familiar to all members of Relief Society. Many have been involved in this gospel ordinance designed for the bestowal of authority to act in a specified capacity. This ordinance, performed by the laying on of hands by proper Priesthood authority, follows the individual's acceptance and approval, by common consent, of a particular Church assignment. With the exception of the General Authorities and other general officers of the Church and some of their associates, persons who are set-apart are authorized to function within clearly established geographical boundaries (Melchizedek Priesthood Manual, 1967, On Earth and in Heaven, Lesson 26, page 194). Setting-apart is not merely a statement to the effect that the individual has been assigned to a particular Church service; it involves the bestowal of authority, and also the obligation and re- 67 January 1967 sponsibilities which pertain to the particular calling. The officiating Priesthood authority, when and as directed by the Spirit of the Lord, may also give instruction, counsel, and a blessing to guide the individual who is to render the special service. Thus the ordinance of settingapart takes the general form of prayer. The individual being setapart is called by his (her) full name and the statement is made that the ordinance is done in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the authority of the Priesthood. Executive officers of auxiliaries are offically set-apart by the appropriate Priesthood authority. Thus stake Relief Society officers, after having been interviewed, approved, and sustained, are set-apart by the stake president or his authorized representative. Officers called to preside in a ward capacity are set-apart by the bishop or his authorized representative. ""The policy of the Church is that there is no need of setting-apart teachers in the auxiliaries" (Ibid.). DISCUSSION 1. In what way does a calling to special Church service set one apart? 2. What general obligations does a woman assume, who is set-apart for a particular position in Relief Society? 3. What responsibility does a Relief Society member have toward the officers in the organization? 4. In what ways is followship as important as leadership? THE PRINCIPLE OF PRESIDENCY Closely associated with the delegation of responsibility, for which individuals are set-apart 68 is the principle of presidency. In relation to Relief Society, we may say that each member of a Relief Society stake or ward presidency, is given a _ specific calling, with attendant responsibilities. The president is the head, her responsibility is to lead, to preside, to make final decisions. Her counselors are called to give support and to counsel. The effective president will, in most instances, make important decisions only after counseling with her counselors. Thus harmony and oneness of purpose are achieved. Counselors should recognize the jurisdiction to which their calling entitles them. They will not only be loyal to the president, giving counsel and support, but will respect the position and decision of the president. This principle, carried into the home, means that the father who is the head of the home, who counsels with his wife, appreciates her support and counsel. The wife, on the other hand, will recognize and honor the position of the husband as head of the home. Thus unity of purpose, oneness of effort, and harmony may be the happy result. FOR CLASS CONSIDERATION 1. Name attributes which encourage harmony in recognizing the principle of presidency. 2. How important to the harmonious and effective progress of a ward Relief Society are the support and appreciation of the members of that Society? "THIS DO IN REMEMBRANCE OF ME"' (Luke 22:19) In a revelation given through the Prophet Joseph Smith, the sanctity of the Sabbath is emphasized in the following words: And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from _ the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day (D&C 59:9). Thus, included in the commandment to keep the Sabbath day holy, is the offering up of personal sacraments. "A sacrament is a_ spiritual covenant between God and man"' (Melchizedek Priesthood Manual, 1967, On Earth and in Heaven, Lesson 23, page 172). In the sacrament known as the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, believers covenant with the Father always to remember his Son, witnessing their willingness to take upon themselves the name of Christ, and to keep his commandments. The ordinance of the sacrament, thus, is the ritual, ceremony, rite, or ordinance, through which members of God's earthly kingdom make and renew solemn covenants to serve the Lord and keep his commandments. The sacrament consists of partaking of bread and water—which has_ been blessed and prepared for that purpose by the authority of the Priesthood— in remembrance of the Lord's sacrifice. The covenants which are made as part of the ordinance are some of the most solemn and sacred found in the gospel (Melchizedek Priesthood manual, 1967, On Earth and in Heaven, Lesson 23, page 172). OF OUR FIRST PARENTS "One of the first great spiritual experiences received by Adam after he became mortal was associated with the law of sacrifice. Of our first parents the scriptural account says that the Lord gave unto them commandments, that they should worship the Lord their God, and should offer the firstLesson Department lings of their flocks, for an offering unto the Lord. And Adam was obedient unto the commandments of the Lord. And after many days an angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying: Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord? And Adam said unto him: I know not, save the Lord commanded me. And then the angel spake, saying: This thing is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, which is full of grace and truth. Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of the Son, and thou shalt repent and call upon God in the name of the Son forevermore (Moses 5:5-8) (Melchizedek Priesthood Manual, 1967, On Earth and in Heaven, Lesson 28, page 178). THE LAW OF SACRIFICE Beginning with the first man and continuing for four thousand long years, the God of Heaven directed his people to offer sacrifice in similitude of the future atoning sacrifice of his Son. All of the patriarchs, prophets, and saints of four millenniums offered the firstlings of their flocks on their sacrificial altars, beasts which were without spot or blemish. These sacrifices signified that the Lamb of God, by the shedding of blood and through his own vicarious. Sacrifice, would atone for the sins of the world (McConkie, Bruce R., Doctrinal New Testament Commentary, Vol. 1, Salt Lake City, Utah, Bookcraft Publishers, 1965, page 718; Melchizedek Priesthood Manual, 1967, On Earth and in Heaven, Lesson 23, pp. 172- 173). SACRIFICE IN ANCIENT AMERICA A knowledge of the law of sacrifice was not limited to the Jews of Palestine. The Nephites in ancient America likewise were taught that an atonement for the sins of man would be made. Before the birth of the Savior, Amulek, explaining the need for and testifying of the future atonement, said: 69 January 1967 For it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice; yea, not a sacrifice of man, neither of beast, neither of any manner of fowl... But it must be an infinite and eternal sacrifice. Therefore, it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice; and then shall there be, or it is expedient there should be, a stop to the shedding of blood... (Alma 34:10, 18; Melchizedek Priesthood Manual, 1967, On Earth and in Heaven, Lesson 23, page 174). Later, when the resurrected Jesus visited the Nephites, he confirmed the passing of the ancient law of sacrifice in the following words: And ye shall offer up unto me no more the shedding of blood; yea, your sacrifices and your burnt offerings shall be done away, for I will accept none of your sacrifices and your burnt offerings. And ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit. And whoso cometh unto me with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, him will I baptize with fire and with the Holy Ghost (3 Nephi 9: 19-20; Melchizedek Priesthood Manual, 1967, On Earth and in Heaven, Lesson 23, page 174). IN THE MERIDIAN OF TIME Relief Society women know that the sacramental service is in remembrance of the atoning sacrifice of Christ. Some, however, may not know that it was instituted in the meridian of time by the Savior, "'to replace the agesold system of sacrifice" (Ibid.). As sacrifice was thus to cease with the occurrence of the great event toward which it pointed, there musi needs be a new ordinance to replace it, an ordinance which also would center the attention of the saints on the infinite and eternal atonement. And so Jesus, celebrating the Feast of the Passover, thus dignifying and fulfilling the law to the full, initiated 70 the sacrament of the Lord's Supper. Sacrifice stopped, and sacrament started. It was the end of the old era, the beginning of the new. Sacrifice looked forward to the shed blood and bruised flesh of the Lamb of God. The sacrament was to be in remembrance of his spilt blood and broken flesh, the emblems, bread and wine, typifying such as completely as had the shedding of the blood of animals in their days (Melchizedek Priesthood Manual, 1967, On Earth and in Heaven, Lesson 23, pp. 174-175). SACRAMENT OF THE LORD'S SUPPER The ordinance of the sacrament, as we have it, had its beginning in the meridian of time and was introduced by the Savior himself. The place was Jerusalem. The time: during the celebration of the Feast of the Passover, just preceding the crucifixion. The Feast of the Passover, sacred Jewish memorial festival, was established at the time of Israel's deliverance from EHEgyptian bondage. At the time of the Savior, people came to Jerusalem from far and near to participate in the annual commemoration of "the outstretched arm of power by which God had _ delivered Israel after the angel of destruction had slain the firstborn in every Egyptian home and had mercifully passed over the houses of the children of Jacob" (TALMAGE, JAMES E.: Jesus the Christ, Edition 13, page 112). Rituals, specific and detailed, were associated with this solemn celebration. On the day preceding the eating of the paschal (Passover) lamb, the selected sacrificial "lambs were slain within the temple court, by the representatives of families or companies who were to eat together; and a portion of the blood of each lamb was sprinkled at the foot of the altar of sacrifice the slain lamb, then said to have been sacrificed, was borne away to the appointed gathering place of those by whom it was to be eaten" (Ibid. Page 593). Some of the disciples inquired of Jesus where they should make preparations for the _ paschal meal. He instructed Peter and John to return to Jerusalem, saying:... Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in. And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guest-chamber where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished; there make ready. And they went, and found as he had said unto them; and they made ready the passover. And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him. And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer (Luke 22:10-15). This upper room to which Jesus and his disciples came to eat the last meal of which the Savior would partake before his death, was the setting for the introduction of one of the most sacred of gospel ordinances. Jesus appears to have observed the essentials of the Passover procedure, although we have no record that all requirements with which tradition had invested this sacred memorial were followed. It is certain, however, that the very presence of Jesus, soon to be crucified for the sins of all men, Lesson Department his prophetic words prefacing his betrayal, and the introduction of the ordinance in remembrance of his sacrifice, set this particular paschal meal — this the Lord's Last Supper — apart from all feasts of the Passover. INSTITUTED AMONG NEPHITES During his brief ministry among the Nephites, as recorded in 3 Nephi, the risen Lord introduced the sacramental ordinance and gave instruction regarding its continuance among those who would believe. And this shall ye always observe to do, even as I have done, even as I have broken bread and blessed it and given it unto you. And this shall ye do in remembrance of my body, which I have shown unto you. And it shall be a testimony unto the Father that ye do always remember me. And if ye do always remember me ye shall have my spirit to be with you (3 Nephi 18:6-7; Melchizedek Priesthood Manual, 1967, On Earth and in Heaven, Lesson 23, page 177). Although the blessings pronounced upon the bread and upon the wine (water) were not recorded in the New Testament, nor do we have a record that they were given to the Nephites on the occasion of the introduction of the ordinance recorded in 3 Nephi, they were, however, "siven to the Nephites and were inserted in the Book of Mormon account centuries later by Moroni (Moroni, chapters 4 and 5)" (Ibid.). Revealed to the Latter-day Saints, we find these prayers of blessing on the sacrament in the Doctrine and Covenants (Section 20). A careful reading of these 7] January 1967 prayers reveals both solemn commitment and wonderful promise to all who worthily partake and who fulfill the requirements of "this sacred ordinance. CLASS DISCUSSION 1. Is the sacrament an ordinance of salvation or of blessing? 2. What personal commitment does one make as she partakes of the sacrament? What blessings are to be received? Do you believe (judging from your own attitude and practice) that during the passing of the sacrament, the majority of adults think specifically of the Savior and his sacrifice? Discuss. 5. What does it mean to "renew our covenants" by partaking of the sacrament? Mo Only when we bring to the sacrament of the Lord's Supper a broken heart and a contrite spirit, a willingness to be known by his name and to keep his commandments, are we promised (through: this ordinance) that the Spirit of the Lord will be with us. As a woman magnifies her service in a particular calling, she will realize the blessings to which the ordinance of setting-apart entitles her. I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise (D&C 82:10). FOR HOME DOING 1. Analyze your own attitude toward the sacran-ent of the Lord's Supper. Try to make this ordinance more meaningful to you as an occasion for renewing your personal covenants, and by considering the commitments which involve you. 2. Help your children to understand the importance of the sacrament. 3. Evaluate the worth of your consistent attendance at sacrament meeting. NOTE TO CLASS LEADERS In presenting this lesson emphasize in the discussion how these ordinances directly affect each sister's life and, in turn, the lives of those who live with her.

Clark Lesson 6—'"Virtue Nourishes the Soul'' 'Virtue is the health of the soul.' Joseph Joubert Northern Hemisphere: Fourth Meeting, April 1967 Southern Hemisphere: August 1967 Objective: To show the beauty and truth of the statement The lesson for this month covers seven short selections plus one somewhat longer story, all of which are printed, with full comments and questions for discussion, in Section Six of Volume 2 of Out of the Best Books. Class leaders and Relief Society sisters having access to the text should study the selections there because space permits only very abbrevjated treatment in this Magazine lesson. Also, class leaders should not try to teach all eight selections because there are too many to cover in one lesson. Instead, each leader should choose those selections she feels will be most valuable for her group. Probably most class leaders will want to use the Tolstoy story as the central selection and add two or three of the shorter pieces for enrichment material. (Note to class leaders: The only selection in this lesson now under copyright prohibiting your making copies of it is the little poem "Fire and Ice" by Robert Frost. All other selections may be re-copied if you desire.) GENERAL COMMENT "Man flows at once to God "Virtue is the health of the soul.'' when the channel of purity is open." Later in this lesson we will read these words in an essay by Thoreau. Wise thinker that he was, Thoreau recognized, as other wise and inspired men have done, that the cultivation of purity moves us toward God and the allowance of impurity moves us away from God. We have the word of the Savior that this is so, for he said: "Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God"' (Matthew 5:8). Note that the emphasis is on purity 'in heart." "Let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly"' was the similar admonition of Joseph Smith as he prayed and suffered in Liberty Jail (Doctrine and Covenants 121:45). The beginning of virtue is self-control of one's actions, to keep them pure. More difficult is control of one's words, to keep them clean and in good taste. Most difficult of all is control of one's thoughts, to keep them wholesome and_ uplifting. All three controls are necessary for the fully virtuous life. These are beautiful words — virtue, modesty, chastity, purity. Men and women should be chaste and modest at all times—never 73 January 1967 vulgar in action, word, dress or thought. Note that the sentence begins '"'"men and women." There is no double standard among Latter-day Saints. The same principles of virtue and clean living apply equally to men as to women. Moreover, as members of the Church striving toward eternal goals, we should avoid not only evil itself but also the appearance of evil and situations in which we are tempted to do evil. We should in all ways and at all times conduct ourselves with dignity, modesty, and control, remembering that temporary pleasures are always wrong if they endanger permanent joy and peace of mind. The only way to be comfortable with oneself is to be comfortable with one's conscience. This is not to suggest a rusty conscience, but a sensitive, clear conscience. There is no sin so small but that avoiding it will make us better, and almost no sin so great but that one can be redeemed from it through genuine repentance. With regard to chastity and unchastity, however, we should remember that the Lord regards sexual relations outside the marriage covenant as a sin second only to murder in seriousness. One cannot restore life when it is taken, nor virtue when it is taken; that is why these are the two most serious sins in human relations. All of these things are, of course, not new. They are as. Old as the gospel, and as true. Indeed, they are a vital part of the gospel, and as Church members we have heard them over and over. The scriptures and the sermons of our living prophets are filled with beautiful, powerful ad- 74 monitions to let virtue govern our lives and to avoid evil. Our purpose, however, in this lesson is to approach these ideals not through scripture and sermon but through art, letting the art-creators of the world add their insight to the joy of pure living and the anguish of impure living. Before moving to the literary selections, we have just two more general items to mention: The first is a reminder that virtue should be genuine and not just surface or narrowed to selfrighteousness. Because the problem of self-righteousness was treated extensively in Volume 1 of Out of the Best Books, we shall not explore it again here. But we do need to be reminded of the danger. The second item is a brief sampling from President David O. McKay's many writings on virtue, chastity, morality, purity, and motherhood. No one in modern times has commented on these things more than our re- -vered contemporary prophet: Love is the highest attribute of the human soul, and fidelity is love's 'noblest offspring. A woman should be queen of her own body. Chastity is the crown of beautiful womanhood, and self-control is the source of true manhood,. Not indulgence. Sexual indulgence whets the passion and creates morbid desire.... Gentleness and consideration after the ceremony are just as appropriate and necessary and beautiful as gentleness and consideration before the wedding. Chastity is the virtue that contributes to the peace and harmony of the home. More homes are ruined and more hearts broken because of unchastity than by the violation of any other virtue. PROVERBS, CHAPTER 31 The last half (verses 10-31) of Chapter 31 of Proverbs in the 'Old Testament serves as an excellent brief introduction to this lesson on virtue. It identifies the attributes of womanly purity and, like the other Psalms and Proverbs, reflects many poetic qualities in its wording. That is, it is lovely both in its substance and its language. Because the Bible is available to all readers, we will not print any of the verses here but simply suggest that Relief Society sisters turn to the Bible itself. Class Discussion How many specific qualities of a virtuous woman can you identify in this passage? What are these qualities? Search your own soul to see how many you possess. CHAPTER XI, "HIGHER LAWS," OF WALDEN Henry David Thoreau (1817- 1862), with Emerson, comprises the heart of the mid-nineteenthcentury American romanticism, known as_ transcendentalism. Walden (1854) is his masterpiece, and one of the great books to come out of America. At other times during 1967-68 we will explore Walden more fully. Here we present just one small excerpt, a part of Chapter XI on "Higher Laws." Several major points are stressed in this passage: (1) The entire universe is moral, and man must be moral, too, or be in conflict with the eternal laws of the universe. (2) Every person has within him animal desires and divine aspirations. Righteousness Lesson Department consists in subduing the animal desires and cultivating the divine aspirations. (3) Chastity, another name for purity, beautifies personality and fills character with power. Contrariwise, unchastity or impurity brings ugliness and also enslavement. (4) Sensuality expresses itself in many ways, all leading downward to degradation, and all part of one gross sensuality. Likewise, spirituality expresses itself in many ways, all part of one whole of purity, leading upward to God. (5) The body is the temple of the human spirit. Whether it be corrupt or noble depends on whether it is enslaved by sensuality or uplifted by beautiful purity. Thoreau says three things better than we can paraphrase him, as the passage itself shows. Class Discussion To what extent does Thoreau in this passage agree with the excerpt from Chapter 31 of Proverbs in defining a pure person? Point out specific points of agreement describing the qualities of virtue. Excerpts from Chapter XI of Walden: Our whole life is startlingly moral. There is never an instant's truce between virtue and vice. Goodness is the only investment that never fails. In the music of the harp which trembles round the world it is the insisting on this which thrills us. Though the youth at last grows indifferent, the laws of the universe are not indifferent, but are forever on the side of the most sensitive. Listen to every zephyr for some reproof, for it is surely there, and he is unfortunate who does not hear it. We cannot touch a string or move a stop but the charming moral transfixes us... We are conscious of animal in us, which awakens in proportion as our higher nature slumbers. It is reptile 15 January 1967 and sensual, and perhaps cannot be wholly expelled; like the worms which, even in life and health, occupy our bodies. Possibly we may withdraw from it, but never change its nature. I fear that it may enjoy a certain health of its own; that we may be well, yet not pure.... Who knows what sort of life would result if we had attained to purity? If I knew so wise a man as could teach me purity I would go to seek him forthwith. Chastity is the flowering of man; and what are called Genius, Heroism, Holiness, and the like, are but various fruits which succeed it. Man flows at once to God when the channel of purity is open. All sensuality is one, though it takes many forms; all purity is one. It is the same whether a man eat, or drink, or cohabit, or sleep sensually. They are but one appetite, and we only need to see a person do any one of these things to know how great a sensualist he is. The impure can neither stand nor sit with purity. When the reptile is attacked at one mouth of his burrow, he shows himself at another. If you would be chaste, you must be temperate. Every man is the builder of a temple, called his body, to the God he worships, after a style purely his own, nor can he get off by hammering marble instead. We are all sculptors and painters, and our material is our own flesh and blood and bones. Any nobleness begins at once to refine a man's features, any meanness or sensuality to imbrute them. WHERE LOVE IS, THERE GOD! S ALSO This great old Russian story by Leo N. Tolstoy (1828-1910) is intended to be the central work in this month's lesson. It not only is a famous story by a famous author but beautifully dramatizes the rich breadth of the qualities of virtue. In its broad sense virtue means more than sexual purity. It means goodness; and it embraces all of the qualities of honesty, charity, spirituality, and 76 righteousness that goodness embraces. Also, the story skillfully weaves throughout its substance the language and ideals of Christ's Sermon on the Mount as found in Chapters 5 to 7 of Matthew and 6 to 7 of Luke. This story, along with Chapter 31 of Proverbs and the excerpt from Walden, is intended as a positive illustration of the qualities of virtue. The story and our discussion of it are much too long, however, to be included or even summarized in this Magazine lesson. Therefore, class leaders and Relief Society sisters should turn to the cultural refinement text for these materials. EXCERPTS FROM "THE EVERLASTING GOSPEL" BY WILLIAM BLAKE Earth groaned beneath, and Heaven above Trembled at discovery of Love. Jesus was sitting in Moses' chair; They brought the trembling woman there. Moses commands she be stoned to death— What was the sound of Jesus' breath? He laid His hand on Moses' law; The ancient heavens, in silent awe, Writ with curses from pole to pole, All away began to roll. There is a human tendency to gossip and spread scandal. One of the harsh consequences of gossip is that people are stigmatized, branded; and even people who want very much to repent are not given much chance to do so because of the gossip and the scandal. Repentance is one of the great principles of the gospel, but another great principle, forgiveness, needs to be practiced—by others. William Blake (1757-1827), was a great mystic poet and painter at the beginning of Eng- lish romanticism. 'Be free, and love all things" were the two great principles dominating all that Blake wrote. This little poem is just a small excerpt from a much longer work. It stands alone as a powerful expression of Christ's gospel of love replacing the Mosaic law of punishment and vengeance. Not "an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth"; rather ''whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also" and "love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you." (Matthew 5:38-44.) All readers will remember the particular incident in Christ's life which serves as background to Blake's poem. (See John 8: 3-11 in the New Testament.) The central point of this scriptural passage, and of Blake's poem, and of the present discussion, is that people who have sinned, especially young people who have committed moral sin, should be given an opportunity through love and understanding to repent and turn to righteous living. Sins are multiplied when to one person's sin of transgression is added another person's sin of unforgiveness. OTHER SELECTIONS In addition to the four selections already mentioned, this lesson embraces three poems which explore special ideas and problems related to the ideals of virtue. All of these are printed, with discussions, in Section Six of Volume 2 of Out of the Best Books, where they may be Lesson Department studied and used as desired by lesson leaders. One of these is "Fire and Ice," a little poem by Robert Frost vividly suggesting the terrible, destructive power of passion. Another is "The City Dead-house" by Walt Whitman, a powerful poem contrasting the beauty of the human body in purity with the ugly waste of the human body in sin. A third is Christina Rossetti's "The Convent Threshold," another powerful poem portraying the anguish of a guilty conscience accompanied by a genuine yearning for the peace of repentance. Class Discussion In what specific ways do _ these selections help motivate us to avoid impurity and seek virtue in our lives? What qualities of womanhood, as shown by these selections, combine to make a fully virtuous woman?
