 Relief Society Calendar. THE Relief Society Magazine Vol. IV. JANUARY,1917.

Vol. IV. JANUARY,1917. No. 1. New Year Epistle Of the Presidency and General Board of the Relief Society, to Officers and Members Everywhere. We offer to you our sincere greetings and congratulations at this auspicious season, for the arduous and useful work we have been enabled to perform during the past year; while we render thanks and gratitude to our Father in heaven that he has given us the opportunity, strength and time to accomplish this labor. The ward and stake branches of the Relief Society throughout the Church have been active and diligent. No complaints reach us of indifference and inactivity, while every report received breathes a spirit of good cheer, hope and faith. It therefore behooves us at this time to felicitate ourselves and you upon the peaceful close of the year, 1916, and the hopeful opening of the year 1917. GENERAL BOARD ACTIVITIES. The. members of the General Board have been very active in visiting the 71 stakes throughout the Church. Like the stake officers who perform a similar task in their own district, our sisters are happy in the sacrifices of time, strength and absence from home, because of the good accomplished and the love and companionship offered to the officers by the members who welcome our general and stake visitors with open arms. We rejoice in the spirit of hospitality which everywhere obtains in this Society, and feel to bless those who open their homes and minister to the general and stake officers at sundry times and places. President Emmeline B. Wells herself visited ten stakes last year and is still able to travel comfortably and profitably. Among 4 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. the visits paid by our General Board members was that undertaken by our General Secretary, Mrs. Amy Brown Lyman, our General Treasurer, Mrs. Emma A. Empey, and the Business Manager of our Magazine, Mrs. Janette A. Hyde. These sisters were accompanied by the Misses Emily and Edith Smith, the two lovely daughters of President and Mrs. Julina L. Smith. They visited the Relief Society of the Eastern States Mission and its branches in Philadelphia, Boston, New York, Toronto, and other places; the Northern States Mission Society in Chicago, and branches of the Society of that mission; the Society of the Central States Mission, located at Independence, Mo., and the Society of the Western States Mission, in Denver. These sisters also visited the historic scenes connected with our early Church history, and while they brought home much valuable information  and inspiration, they also left with the sisters where they visited, the good spirit of hope, faith and trust in our heavenly Father. THE MISSIONS. The organization of the Society is complete, so far as we know. There have been many changes in ward and stake officers, and while we have said good-by reluctantly to those who have passed out and passed on, we welcome the new comers into our official ranks. The missions have never been in such splendid working order as they are today. Particularly active is the Northern and Central States and the California Missions. Here cur lesson work, Magazine, genealogy and general Relief Society interests have been actively carried forward for a long period. The Eastern States Mission recently reorganized, and the Western and Southern States Society with the Northwestern States, all of them organized in later years, are forging rapidly ahead in every line of Relief endeavor. The growth of the Society in the European Mission has been phenomenal. We are exceedingly proud and grateful for the work done in that war-swept land of Europe, by our sisters, presided over until this summer by Sister Ida B. Smith, wife of President Hyrum M. Smith. The European Relief Society was engaged during the past year principally in the preparation of clothing and food materials for the destitute families of the soldiers in the trenches in the various nations which are at war, and where our branches are located. SCHOOL OF OBSTETRICS AND NURSING. Our School of Obstetrics and Nursing is successfully going forward in this city, and a course in invalid cookery has been NEW YEAR EPISTLE. 5 added to the other courses. We recommend our stake and ward officers to increase the scope of this work by sending to us properly qualified students each year, so that the wards and towns can be supplied with Relief Society nurses, who are now such a necessary part of our social organization. PUBLIC HEALTH WORK. Closely associated with this work has been the activity manifested in our public health department. It was thought advisable to associate our efforts in Salt Lake with the city Board of Health in assisting to supply the milk depots with Relief Society nurses and matrons for these stations. Great good has thus been accomplished. our "magazine." Our Relief Society Magazine has succeeded beyond our utmost expectations. We thank you for your generous support, and suggest that you increase your efforts to make this Magazine the best possible official organ and medium of communication between your general officers, stake and ward Relief Societies. We increased the size of our Magazine 16 pages, during the past year, and so rapidly did our subscriptions pour in during the first three months that we were obliged to issue hundreds of copies more than we had at first planned for. The editorial policy of the Magazine has been to supply clean, wholesome, cheerful and helpful articles, consisting of the various departments found there, with the addition of the lesson work which occupies the most important part of our Magazine. We are greatly encouraged with the good reports which come from all parts of our Relief Society concerning the Magazine and feel that it has been a worthy successor to the noble Woman's Exponent which was so long and ably conducted and edited by our General President. Emmeline B. Wells. The increased expense of paper for this year, and of all other matters incurred in our publication, has been a serious problem, but we hope to make no changes in our subscription price and the other features of our Magazine. By strict economy of the management, and your own generous support, we shall reach the end of the year successfully and satisfactorily. GENEALOGY AND TEMPLE WORK. The efforts put forth in the study of genealogy and in the taking of excursions to the various temples by the members of this Society worthy of the highest commendation. The First C RELIEF SOCIETY M. IGAZINE. Presidency of the Church and the General Board of the Genealogical Society of Utah, together with the Presidents of the various temples have expressed commendation and appreciation of the work done by the sisters in this matter. We should not slacken our efforts, for this work lies at the foundation of our spiritual life. Other temples are building, and others still will be built, in the near future, provided the Saints continue their activities in this direction. We suggest to you all the motto adopted by the Genealogical Committee of our General Board in regard to every phase of this genealogical and temple work. "Let us provoke the brethren to good works, and not provoke the brethren while we are doing the work." We suggest the continuance of primary genealogical lessons in the various wards, and that each member of the Society shall attend one day in a temple during the year 1917. or arrange for a substitute. Excursions on regular days to the Temples should be undertaken, always with the sanction and approval of the presiding priesthood. We hope you will prepare the index cards which have been partially distributed, and send them back to this office as soon as you have completed your task. More can be furnished on application to this office. GUIDE WORK. The Theological lessons will be supplemented this year by suggested chapters for reading the Scriptures. We are very desirous of having our members devote a portion of each day to the reading of the Scriptures. In the rush and hurry of modern life this pleasing pioneer custom has been considerably neglected and we are. therefore, giving a series of chapter readings which will illustrate and supplement our Theological lessons. The Literary lessons will appeal to all of our members, for they will help us to understand the written page and to develop a taste for good literature which otherwise is likely to be swept out of existence, in the flood of cheap papers and magazines which come to our homes. We congratulate ourselves upon this new study, and trust you will find it but a supplementary key added to the splendid lessons on Art and Architecture which have been given during the past two years. , HOME SCIENCE LESSONS. The General Board have united forces with the President of the Agricultural College of Utah and his associate teachers, in the presentation of our Home Science lessons. The study of Domestic Science and Art with associated studies in Sanitation and the care of children, has become a home necessity everywhere. NEW YEAR EPISTLE. 7 We have felt, therefore, the wisdom of taking advantage of the Smith-Lever provision which enables any organized body of women to receive trained help from the Agricultural Colleges, in the United States, through the College Extension Division, in any line of domestic problems. Our lessons which are prepared by experts, under the charge of the Agricultural College of Utah, will provide material, while their teachers can be invited to visit your wards and towns to lecture on these subjects whenever you are disposed to ask for their services. We would suggest that you assist in establishing this work on a firm foundation, and congratulate you on the pleasing results already obtained. Arrangements have been completed so that free scholarships in the District Round-Ups and in the Agricultural College itself are offered to our Relief Society chosen delegates. PENNY SUBSCRIPTION FUND. The Penny Subscription Fund which was very modestly undertaken and which was heartily approved by the First Presidency of the Church and the Presiding Bishopric, has resulted in a contribution which already exceeds our fondest hopes. Every woman who thus contributes of her means and teaches her children and grandchildren the beauty of this expression of sweet philanthropic emotions, will both benefit the temples in receiving the funds, and herself and family in the enlarged sympathies and spiritual understanding which will result through the exercise of this voluntary contribution. CLOTHING FOR THE DEAD. The department of clothing for the dead, conducted in this city has grown to substantial proportions. The clothing prepared under the supervision of Counselor Julina L. Smith is of the best materials obtainable, and the workmanship thereof is exquisite in design and beautiful in execution. All prices are arranged to suit the varying needs of individuals whose loved ones are to be clothed and laid away. In due time the labor and advantages of this department will extend in scope into the various stakes. With larger quarters in this city and more extended opportunities for growth, we shall hope to make this department of great value to every member of this Society and this Church. RELIEF SOCIETY HOME. Our home for women and girls is crowded all the time and we could wish for larger quarters, but prudence dictates a modest X RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. and economical adjustment of our resources and we, therefore, have not as yet suggested any change in our present admirable an 1 comfortable home. INSURANCE. We invite the sisters to investigate and to accept of this excellent means of insuring themselves a decent and modest burial as well as the other forms of domestic insurance opened to us. Capitalized at home, every dollar paid in to this fund builds up our home state and our own people, thus preventing the outflow of money which is now pouring out of this state to eastern insurance centers. This department should be patronized liberally by all. as it is here at headquarters. GENERAL CONFERENCES . The two conferences  of the year were highly successful and productive of great good. Especially was the Teachers' Convention, during the October suggestions and hints to the great body of women who form our teachers' quorums. The topics suggested for the teachers to use will assist them in the furtherance of their good work. The Exchange Bureau, in the Presiding Bishop's Office, should be patronized by all our members who have any need for it. We are always glad to welcome representatives from our stakes at these general conferences , and we feel that all of us need them as a source of mutual assistance and inspiration. OUR CHARITY. We rejoice in the continued activity of our charitable works anil realize that it is largely through the continuous efforts of our sisters that there is so little poverty and suffering amongst this people. I et this always be the foundation stone of our Relief Society structure. Again, we would suggest the emphasis which should be placed upon our Testimony Meetings. These are the means of inspiring testimonies in those who have them not. of strengthening the faith in the hearts of those who have already been converted, and of encouraging and blessing the sisters everywhere. Center your efforts and give the best of your loving devotion, after your home duties have been accomplished satisfactorily, to the building up and developing of the Relief Society, not "strewing our ways to strangers. as the Bible phrases it, not giving our first love to worldly pursuits and associations; but let us confine  NEW YEAR EPISTLE. 9 cur labor chiefly within our own ranks and amongst the people of God. THE REFORM MOVEMENT. The First Presidency have called upon our Society to unite with the Young Ladies and Primary Associations in a reform movement, and the General Committees from these three Boards are actively engaged in the formulation of plans and resolutions which will be key-notes to us all in our conduct for the year 1917. We are in the world, but we should not partake of the evils thereof. Modesty in dress, restraint of appetite, observance of the Sabbath Day, and of the Word of Wisdom, decorum and dignity in our public worship and amusements should characterize the conduct and habits of every member of this Society. We are responsible, in great measure, for the good or bad conduct of our sons and daughters. With our long experience and training, with good words and good work, we feel secure in offering an assurance to the Presiding Authorities of the Church that this Society and all its members will actively engage in carrying out their counsels to the very letter. We offer to you, dear sisters, the hand of fellowship and blessing for the year 1917, the testimony of the General President, Emmeline B. Wells, her close association with the Prophet Joseph Smith and the founding of this Society, and with all the subsequent leaders thereof, her unquestioned integrity to the truth, her keen intelligence and her wise adaptation to constantly developing conditions, constitute her the leading voice and presence amongst our sex today. The testimony of her Counselors and her Board joins with hers in the happy announcement to you and to the world at large, that as the mothers and wives of the sons of men who hold the Priesthood in this day and generation, we will stand shoulder to shoulder with them in establishing righteousness upon this earth, that peace may come to all men of good will, and to the end that Christ's Kingdom may reign upon earth as it does in heaven. Emmeline B. Wells. President. Clarissa S. Williams, First Counselor. Tulina L. Smith, Second Counselor. Mrs. Alice Merrill Home. The officers and members of the Relief Society will be surprised to learn of the release of Sister Alice Merrill Home, grand-daughter of our late beloved and honored President Bathsheba W. Smith, who felt it best to relax her arduous labors by leaving the General Board, for wise and sufficient reasons. Sister Home has been a power for good during the long years she has been associated with the General Board of this Society. Particularly efficient has been her labor in the realm of Art, for she is keenly susceptible to the beautiful in nature and to man's expressions of beauty in every form. Her book Devotees and Their Shrines has been widely circulated, and has reached thousands of women who have been lifted up by its teachings into the realm of harmony and loveliness, unable to attend to their board duties. Mrs. Home has been equally efficient and active in her labors as chairman of the Public Health committee. She has performed a very unique task during the past summer in the milk stations, which have been under her charge, associated with the city authorities. All forms of sanitation and private and public health are vitally important to this public-spirited worker, and the General Board will miss her labors in this and many other directions. While we greatly regret parting with Sister Home, we admire the courage and wisdom of her decision to sever her connection with the Board when she found it impossible to do justice to both her public and private labors. We would commend her example to others of our sisters who occupy positions in our various boards, but who are unable to perform their labors there. An honorable release from such positions would be of advantage to both the individual who had the wisdom to ask for it, and to the organization who would thus be relieved of members who are unable to attend to their board duties. The General Board tendered to Sister Home a complimentary luncheon Thursday, November 25, in their own rooms, on which occasion everything was as merry as a marriage bell. The honored guest herself was a beam of sunshine, while the committee on the luncheon and program, consisting of Mrs. Elizabeth C. McCune, Mrs. Emily St. Richards. Mrs. Carrie S. Thomas, and Mrs. Janette A. Hyde, were distinctly joyous, not to say hilarious in the discharge of their immediate functions. President Wells and her counselors laughed and said witty and pleasant things in full MRS. ALICE MERRILL HORNE. 11 sympathy with the pleasant occasion. The following lines were read by a member of the Board: LINES TO ALICE MERRILL HORNE. Whenever there's a meeting, there's a parting by the way, And so we meet to part again, on this auspicious day. Of all the meetings and the partings, since ever I was born, This is the oddest parting with our gifted Alice Home. She's helped us with our Guide work; she's done her active part, In making every meeting a little work of art. She's planned, how she's worked, she's run about to teach the mothers To get the babies' pure milk right from a healthy cow. She's helped us see the beauty in a daisy by the brook, And made the world more lovely in the pages of her book, She's striven for the bright things, and tried to help us find That life is not all drudgery, if we have an open mind. And so we'll miss our Alice, but wherever she may go, She'll take with her our blessing, and a lot of love also. We know that she will daily strive to do her fullest duty, Still bringing to the world a love of Nature and of beauty. LIFE'S WINTRY WAY. Hand in hand two lovers wandered In a storm, one wintry day, Laughing gaily at the snowflakes Which were falling every way. Isn't life, she gaily whispered. One great day of sweet content? And if we'd seek for God's own beauty, We'd rejoice whate'er He sent. Thus they spoke because there lingered In their hearts a thrill of love Given early in life's morning When they left their home above. But as years, with trial and crosses, Came to change and chill their hearts, They let care drive out the pleasures Which once seemed of their lives a part. 12 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. Once again we find them wandering, Aged and bent one wintry day, Mid the storms of life together Toiling slowly on their way. Life is changed for these two lovers, They have found it cold and stern. O how gladly they would change it, If their youth would but return. Youth comes but once to mortals. Old age, with frost and snow, Sets seal forever on them As they wander here below. Though hopes of youth lay blighted, Their dead beneath their feet, They learned sweet faith from trials And the bitter grew more sweet. To those who now are living With sorrow day by clay, You're learning faith and patience, For love points out the way. There is beauty in the future, There is youth for you again; Pray and cling to God's own promise, Life's struggle's not in vain. 'Tis the path ordained by Father, You are treading here on earth, And if you His pathway follow, He will test and prove your worth. In His furnace He will try you Till you' soar above life's ill; So rejoice in tribulation. Row in meekness to His will. Tho' your youth has long since vanished, Let your hopes be ever young; ' Gladly take what He will send you, Sing I listen praise with heart and tongue. Though the future now is hidden 'Neath the snowflakes falling fast, These will vanish with the sunshine Which the Lord will send at last. Basalt, Idaho. Marie Jensen. A Forced Business Venture. A YOUNG WIFE'S STORY. Ida Stewart Peay. It is a tragedy for a man with a family to be "laid off," or. at least, I felt it so when in the first five years of our married life, my husband was out of work six different times. Once eleven weeks elapsed before he could again secure a job, and such trying times were intensified by the knowledge that three bright, hearty children looked to us for proper care. I knew my husband was not an unsatisfactory workman. Hundreds of other men, moderately capable, as well as entirely honest and industrious, who also hired out their services by the day at unskilled labor, suffered a like experience. Their engagements depended, apparently, upon the rush periods of the various business concerns of the city. One day when my companion came home "laid off" again, I bitterly deplored conditions which made it practically impossible for a father, able and anxious to earn a livelihood, to secure continuous employment. It seemed as if I could hardly bear the thought of want and deprivation the words "laid off" conjured. They were a tragedy to me as, no doubt, they were and still are to thousands of others; yet I felt obliged to admit, upon reflection, there was, obviously, no other course for the "day laborer" but to work or idle at the pleasure and convenience of the "managers" of the world's affairs. Then I asked my husband seriously, if he could not go into business for himself, and be one of the "managers." As he was only a common "day laborer" without a trade or any special training or education, without capital, and moreover involved to the extent of a thousand dollars for our little home, the idea looked preposterous. Nevertheless, because of our desperate predicament, we talked over all the possibilities, finally evolving a plan that actually appeared feasible, and the trial was decided upon. In our home town, a western city of some ten thousand inhabitants, my husband had worked most of the time at a big foundry and machine shop, where he evidenced considerable native mechanical ability, and acquired a good deal of knowledge and skill in iron work. He was never "fired" from this place, merely being "laid off." from time to time, as were most comparatively new hands in dull seasons. He now approached a fellow workman at the foundry, who Mas well acquainted with all kinds of iron 14 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. welding, and suggested to him that they form a partnership and open a blacksmith and general repair shop. The man had never thought of such a course, but he felt satisfied that with their combined experience they could take care of that kind of business. Also, he, too was eager to become more independent, and after due consideration, the partnership was effected. The new firm first found and bought a piece of property, forty feet front by twelve rods back on the center or main street of the city. The price was seven hundred dollars, making a debt of three hundred fifty for each man to shoulder, and each, thereupon, agreed to pay $5 a month until the principal and interest, which latter was charged at the rate of eight per cent, were paid off. Next my husband proposed to put up the building, if his associate in the venture would furnish sufficient tools with which to begin work. This being accepted, the shop was built of corrugated iron with rubberoid roofing, the cost reaching something over one hundred dollars. A lumber company furnished the material promising to take shop work for one-half of the amount, and $2 per month for the other half, until the debt was liquidated. The partner made a similar arrangement to obtain the tools, and thus, within fourteen days after the first inception on the of the plan, with a   neat red sign front the red building, began to do business for themselves. Their troubles, however, were by no means over. Several days passed without the appearance of even one customer. A few Job's comforters poked their heads in at the door to sniff and say they didn't know when these fellows had learned the blacksmith trade, but hoped they'd do all right. Those were dark hours fraught with discouraging possibilities. I sought out the wife of my husband's partner, and we made it up between us that our homes should abound with such mottes as, "Never give up." "Keep smiling." "All things come to those who t work and) wait," etc. The men caught the spirit and became more determined to succeed. They studied "blacksmith" magazines and journals at night, built fires in their forges, and hammered on their nails at practice work all day. They made simple tools, repaired everything about their own premises and appeared to be mighty busy. At last their patience was rewarded by a few customers, though at the time of the first month only $15 a piece had been earned. All the same, we women were hopeful, and pointed out the undeniable fact that $15 was more than they made when "laid off," so we urged them to "keep hammering." The second month $30 for each man was secured, which seemed encouraging, even if it wasn't a living wage. To be sure, A FORCED BUSINESS VENTURE. 15 we had no luxuries in those days, but we were very happy for all that, finding a wealth of pleasure in working towards the accomplishment of an end. The partners vied with each other in devising new and economical business methods; while we wives were enthusiastically trying to see which could contrive and serve the cheapest, yet the most wholesome and tasty meals. We ransacked old chests for clothes to remodel, became acquainted with dyes, found the remnant and bargain counters, and tried our hands at millinery. We joked and laughed away many difficulties, and struggled on. Better still, the new "managers" "kept hammering," and became more proficient daily in their chosen vocation. The end of the first year found them realizing $50 per month each. This sum was as much as either had received as wages at the Foundry, and being constant, proved quite satisfactory. But happily their success did not stop at this point. Instead, the business of the little firm continued to grow rapidly and steadily until their respective salaries crept up to $75 per month and finally after ten years to $100, and is still on the upward move. All because they dared to venture, risked everything, then sacrificed, schemed and labored diligently and persistently to "make good." The moderate prosperity that rewarded their honest efforts has brought these two bread-winners a pride and contentment that is inspiring to witness. They now boast a splendid shop equipment, their property has doubled in value, they occupy a place of usefulness in the community, their firm name is known for reliability, and best of all, they can never again be "laid off." TOO BUSY. We are busy folks in a busy world. Madly rushing to and from. There are so many to be done, So many places to go, That we havent time to really live, So we put it off, with a sigh And we dream of the wonderful things well do In the Beautiful by and by. Too busy to take a walk in the woods With the dear one who longs to go. Too busy to write a letter of love To the mother aged and slow; Too busy to visit a friend who is forgotten to smile; Too Busy to do a thousand things That would be really worth while. Too busy to think of a cheery word
To pass to a comrade who's sad. Too busy to kiss the face of a child That its little heart might be glad. Too busy to rest, too busy to pray, Too busy to laugh or to smile,Too busy doing the lesser things  To make life really worth while. Mrs. Parley Nelson, MANTI, UTAH. Isobel Gives a New Year's Dinner And Brings Mother to the Rescue. By Diana Farrish. Fate seemed to be against Tom's and Isobel's New Year's Eve dinner party from the start. The very day itself began with a blinding storm, which made one feel disagreeable. It was so dark that she and Tom were half an hour late in getting up. The baby waked and hindered them with a peevish fretting so that Tom was three-quarters of an hour later than usual, when he dashed off the porch to catch a car for the office without kissing Isobel goodbye. Both of them were annoyed that he should be late for work on the very day that he was going to bring his manager and his wife home for dinner. It looked as if he were making extraordinary preparations. Tom wanted the dinner to be without pretense  just the usual sort of dinner that they had every night. Isobel watched Tom from the door with her lace cap awry. Indeed it came dangerously near covering completely one eye. In her dismay at not being kissed goodbye, she scarcely noticed it. Then suddenly bethinking herself  of the task before her she wheeled about. A puff of smoke from the chafing-dish met her eye. Her nose told her that the electric current under it had not been turned off and that the remains of the scrambled eggs from breakfast had been burned into abominable-smelling gas. She switched off the current and carried the blackened pan to the kitchen. The burnt eggs struck her as being a bad omen. Isobel gathered the dishes into the sink, busily planning the while the best procedure for the day. The pastry must be made immediately after the dishes were finished. The thought of making pastry on the day of company was rather disturbing. Indeed, Isobel was conscious of a feeling of guilt when she recalled that she had spent the two days before in shopping and at parties instead of beginning preparations for the dinner for Mr. Benson and his wife. She wondered if she could not omit the pastry from her menu, but she remembered that Tom had asked especially to have green pea patties, as he had told Mr. Benson about the delicious ones Isobel could make and had promised to let him sample them. No, Tom should not be disappointed, and Isobel splashed into the dishes so that she could make good her promise. As she dried the first plate she heard a faint sound of crying from the bedroom. In her deep absorption she had forgotten to ISOBEL GIVES A NEW YEAR'S DINNER. 17 feed and dress the baby. She listened again. The cries grew stronger and she hastened in. "Darling! Did oo's muver forget oo?" she gurgled. Tommie howled the louder, no doubt to show appreciation of his mother's attention. voice "There, which we there," she soothed with queer little twists of the voice which we like to use on infants . But the infant of not could the be soothed and while he was being bathed, dressed and fed, he cried fretfully. Poor Isobel was nearly distracted when she finally got him into his little bed asleep. "Mercy! it's half past eleven," she screamed, glancing at the clock, "and I haven't done one thing!" Isobel pondered. Better to give up the idea of pastry  but Tom's promise to Mr. Benson. Why, oh why, had the boy promised to give the "boss" a taste of his wife's pastry? Again Isobel resolved that her husband should not be disappointed. Leaving the dishes unfinished, she began on the pastry, in order to get it into the ice-chest to chill properly. Carefully she measured the ingredients for the wonderful paste. A pound of flour, and a pound of butter. Sift the flour, then work in part of the butter. Add sufficient ice-water to make a dough of the right consistency. Isobel proceeded slowly with the intricate folding in of the remaining butter. How queer the butter seemed today. It was impossible to get it right. The flour seemed to stick to it in large lumps. Some of the flour was full of butter and some of it was totally without. She worked the paste round and round. In her anxiety she worked it too long, and the paste formed into a sticky mass, instead of crisp-looking dough. In desperation, she added a little more flour, hoping to get the right results. But it was no use. With disturbing visions beginning to haunt her, she pushed the stuff into the refrigerator. Then she turned hastily to her dishes. As she put her hands into the dish pan, she glanced nervously at the clock. She was shocked to see the fingers pointing to half-past one. She had spent two hours with the wretched paste! Horrified, she considered again. The mayonnaise must be made that very minute, if they were to have salad. It also must be chilled thoroughly. Isobel brought olive oil from the refrigerator and broke the yolks of two eggs into a bowl. She beat the eggs hurriedly, mentally chiding herself the while for so foolishly leaving her preparation until the last day. She added a pinch of salt to thicken the yolks, and beat on and on. Then a drop of oil into the eggs, beating slowly and carefully. A little more oil, more beating and the dressing was beautifully thick and yellow. Now a spoonful of lemon juice and then the oil again. The rest was easy. The mayonnaise being well started, the oil could be poured in more rapidly. She turned in a thin stream, which 18 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. thickened up quickly under the beater. She lifted the can again. A thin stream started slowly out and ended in drops. Isobel sank into a chair in consternation. The oil can was empty. With a sinking heart she realized that it was Wednesday afternoon and the grocery stores were all closed. She also painfully remembered that the Bensons disliked any sort of boiled salad dressing. Isobel pulled herself together sharply. There was not a minute to be lost. Banishing the disturbing thoughts of the dishes and the untidy house, she brought in the chickens. She cut the string from the parcel and turned out two big, fat chickens in a fresh bed of parsley. Joe, the Italian poultryman, had kept his word very well. "I clean him very good, madam. I clean him very good." Encouraged by the appearance of the poultry, Isobel made haste with the stuffing, which was to be made with nothing less delectable than chestnuts. She opened the bag of nuts and after determined and painful effort succeeded in tearing them from their shells. Nothing daunted, she proceeded according to the directions of the cook-book, and poured boiling water over The wonderful nuts. Yes, Isobel was making chestnut stuffing for the first time. She was going against the oldest maxim her mother possessed  "Never try a new dish for company." It seemed as if the boiling water created an immediate affinity between those nuts and their tough brown skins. Isobel gingerly pulled one of them out and tried to peel off the skin. It stuck like the proverbial paper on the wall. She tried another  and another  and another  she cut her finger with the sharp little knife. Then she tried another  At that moment the telephone rang frantically. It was a shock to Isobel. It woke Tommie up and started him crying. The bell kept on ringing. Isobel rushed to answer it. "Hello," she shrieked, "hello!" "Number please," cooed the cool, honey-sweet voice of the telephone operator. "Number!" screamed Isobel; "didn't you just ring here?" "Wrong number," floated over the wire and the telephone switch clicked in Isobel's ear. She hung up the receiver and started toward the bedroom Taking up the baby, she walked the floor with him. It was not scientific to do such a thing, "but for that matter the latest authorities on baby-raising disapproved of picking the child up at all. He should be left to cry until he stopped. Any way, she was not in a mood for science, so she patted the baby and bounced him about as she fretted over the dinner. "I was silly to leave all these things until today. And I should have done what Tom told me to  get Bessie to tend the baby. I" 10SBEL GIVES ANEW YEAR'S DINNER. 19 A dreadful squall from Tommie cut short her reflection. "What ever is the matter with this child?" She walked hurriedly to and fro swinging and swaying her son. She undid his clothes and made an exhaustive examination for any stray pins which are the terror of the young mother's life. And still the child cried. Isobel was trembling now. She was terrified by the violent screams. Back and forth, back and forth she paced utterly, helpless to know what to do. Should she telephone Tom? Tom was probably busy with Mr. Benson. It might mean a disturbance. Should she telephone her mother? She didn't like to bother her mother  anyway who would hold the baby while she did telephone? Back and forth, back and forth. At length she dropped into a chair exhausted by the excitement and worry. Tears rolled down her cheeks and mingled with those of the howling baby. Just then there was a slight tap at the door, and mother, smiling brightly, pushed in. "You poor dear," began mother, totally ignoring the appearance of the house, "the baker-boy told me he heard your baby crying, so I could over." came not Isobel speak. She weakly handed the baby to her mother. Mother felt the child, examined his clothes and then laying him face downward over her arm, she walked into the kitchen. "About what I thought," she murmured to herself as she poured boiling water over the powdered catnip leaves which she had ventured to bring along. While the tea steeped, she tried to soothe the child who seemingly affected by her very presence, quieted down to fitful squeaks. A little cream and a little sugar in the tea and then between squeals Tommie was fed his "catnip tea," mother's faithful "cure-all." "Will he be all right?" asked the frightened daughter, following her mother into the kitchen. "Quite," answered mother. The very relief seemed to unnerve Isobel further. She wept unrestrainedly, meanwhile telling mother of her distress. "I should have done the pastry yesterday, all the things for that matter. Today everything I touched went wrong. The paste is a complete failure, and all my butter is gone except what 1 need for the table. My oil was gone and I did not know it until too late. And I couldn't skin the horrid chestnuts," spluttered Isobel between sobs. Mother's eyebrows went up at the word "chestnuts." Wisely she refrained from asking questions. She tip-toed into the bedroom and laid the* sleeping baby down. "Now about dinner." 20 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. She came back into the kitchen and glanced at the clock. Three o'clock. Without scruple mother rolled up the sleeves of her best afternoon blouse. She tied an apron round her waist. "How would it be to serve the asparagus hot with butter and serve plain lettuce as a salad with that old Spanish dressing made of cream?" Isobel nodded acquiescence. "You run along and straighten these rooms, and lay the table. I'll get these things started." In the face of disaster mother was the seasoned soldier  Isohel the raw recruit. The way mother whiped into that dinner was something to glory in. Under her swift fingers, a little flour, lard, salt and water become crisp crinkling patties of a perfect brown. Under her skillful hands, bread crumbs, a little butter, finely minced onion ana seasoning became the savory filling that sent a tempting fragrance from the kitchen when the chickens went into the oven. A little whipped cream thinned with a few drops of vinegar, sweetened with sugar and toned up with paprika developed Isobel into camera salad dressing into the kitchen fit to and grace found a king's table. the transformation. She knew what wizard deeds her mother could do, but it seemed to her they had never been so magical before. "Now you get into your dinner dress, dear. You will have time for a little rest. I'll take baby home with me and send Beatrice over to help you." Isobel choked up again. "How can you be so wonderful, mother? How can I thank you or return the kindness? And however did you know how to manage the baby?" Mother rolled down her sleeves slowly. "Wait till you have seven." And she smiled her knowing little smile. On the cultivation of the minds of women depends the wisdom of men. A woman is the equal of man  when she is.  Elbert Hubbard. Mothers in Israel. Mary Ann Stearns Winters. DEPARTURE FROM COMMERCE. [We give in this number another of the vivid sketches written by that gifted pioneer mother, Mrs. Winters. These articles began in our last volume, and are given exactly as prepared by the author. No historical connecting links have been supplied, as our Church teems with such material. These sketches, fragmentary as they are, cast a food of light on those past, stormy days.  Editor.] On August 29, 1839, we left Commerce in a covered wagon with two horses, and traveled across the country toward the great lakes. Besides Brother Pratt and my mother there were the two little boys, Parley and Nathan, and myself; and also accompanying us were Brother Orson Pratt and Hyrum Clark, but they soon left us and went preaching through the country as they passed along. The first days of the journey I enjoyed very much as we were traveling over flower-decked prairies, and through beautiful groves. Best of all, we were again free and happy  not afraid of mobs and violence  in a land of friendliness, meeting sympathy on every hand. Brother Pratt was again at liberty  our protector was with us  he had started on a mission and was preaching wherever we stopped, the Saints received us joyfully and with open arms and hearts, asking innumerable questions of our trials and troubles in Missouri, and we little children who had been in the prison received no small share of their attention. love and sympathy. And the little Parley, the child of promise, was caressed and with tearful eyes hugged to the hearts of the motherly sisters who entertained us. And these people were all settled in comfortable homes with plenty around them  and after all that we had suffered and passed through, this journey seemed to me like a triumphal march through the land of promise. In a few days I took the ague and was very sick. When the fever came on, I suffered greatly with the jolting of the wagon, and thought I could not possibly endure it; but mother would encourage and comfort me, and as the hours rolled on, my fever would get lower and by the time we came to a stopping place, I would be able to get up and join with the other children. In about two weeks the chills left me, and by the time we arrived at Brother Anson Pratt's at Detroit, Michigan, I had fully recovered my health and could enjoy the company of Brother Pratt's children. The friendships then formed between us have continued through all our lives. Sister Pratt was a kind, motherly woman. 22 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. and gained the love and respect of her acquaintances; but I never saw her after, and when I again met my little friends they were motherless. After our happy visit with them for two or three weeks, we took a boat to cross the lake, and while on the boat a little incident occurred that made a lasting impression on my mind. Mother had bought some candy before starting  had given some to us children, and we were not to have any more for the present, but the hand-bag was in plain sight, and my love for candy overcame my obedience. I reached and took out a very few pieces. They were coriander seeds coated with sugar, about the size of a pill, and very rough. I walked away a few steps to eat my forbidden fruit, feeling very guilty, then gave a little hop to ease my conscience, when one of the pieces went the wrong way and I choked very badly and thought I would surely die, but someone caught me and began pounding me on the back when out came the candy and rolled across the floor, and I was relieve;! both in body and mind, for now mother knew about it, and I would not have to worry under a hidden guilt. When all was quiet again, mother drew me to her and talked very seriously to me about the sin of disobedience, and that -there was always a penalty for wrong-doing, and that this act of mine might have cost me my life  that things done in secret were always brought to light, and in some cases were to be proclaimed upon the housetop. All this made a very deep impression on my mind, for I felt that I had been very severely punished for what I had done; and in all the long years since then, I have seen her words verified in thousands of incidents. Nothing of importance occurred to me during the remainder of the journey, and we arrived in New York to find a large branch of the Church enjoying the faith of the gospel, and the meeting was a joyous one with the friends we had left two years before, as also with the new converts that flocked to meet us. We soon took up our abode in Mott street. and Sister Eliza Nelson provided the furniture to furnish the house and came to live with us. Oh, what more holy than a mother's love, That which endures all other ties above? That love which falters not when others fail, A lamp in life, a lamp o'er death's own vale! Though to the world we naked are and poor, Yet there a temple where we dwell secure. There is the sacred lamp, which burns for aye, Most steadfast love that dwells in mortal clay. There is the gift all pure of selfish aim, The mother's love, the one exhaustless flame! In mother's love, whatever else our lot, Oh, there the love which gives and wearies not! If life's one hope becomes but hope that's been, Yet on a mother's love the soul may lean. Though all forsake us, hers a love to save, Her love is from our cradle to her grave. Alfred Lambourne. Home Evening Entertainment. By Morg. It was Friday evening, and the Arbor family were gathered around the fire in their comfortable living room. The family consisted of Henry Arbor, who was a successful business man and farmer; his wife Jean; Mara, the eldest, a quiet, gentle home girl; Charlie, the tall son who was his father's right hand; Lottie and Ella, the twins, who were attending the county high school; Harold, aged fourteen; Jemima, usually called "Jim," and the last one dearly loved by all whose name was Lilian. "Tonight is our home evening," said Lottie, "and it's mother's turn to take charge." "Goody," said Jim, "we will sure have a dandy time, for mother has been baking something all day. Oh, I nearly told," laughed the happy girl. A knock sounded at the door, and old Sister McDonald was brought in, followed closely by Brother Sandy McNab, the blacksmith, who lived near by. "It's f a braw chair nicht the nicht," said he as he drew up a comfortable chair near the fire. "I know what we are going to have tonight," cried Ella. "Something Scotch!" she continued. "Mother has had on her far-away look all day." "Thinking of the bonny heather hills, and the Scotch bluebells, mother?" queried Charlie. , "Yes," answered his mother with a smile, "and as tonight is the 25th of January, and the anniversary of Robert Burns, the poet, we are going to have a 'Burns' nicht' program." "Ah, now we know why you invited Sister McDonald," said Mara, "she was born near the poet's birthplace, and can tell us all about the Banks and Braes o' Bonny Doon." "We will have our evening worship first," announced father quietly. After their scripture reading and hymn, the family knelt for prayer which was offered reverently by brother Charlie. "We will first sing 'Sweet Afton,' " said mother. "Harold, pass around those copies you made for me yesterday on your typewriter." The tune was quickly found in the Sunday School book, page 224, and all joined in singing the dear old song. Mara then read a brief sketch of the life of the poet Burns, and Sister McDonald told of the humble cot on the banks of the Doon where the poet was born. HOME EVENING ENTERTAINMENT. 25 "Now pa, it's your turn," said mother, and father read "The Cotter's Saturday Night." "It's my turn now," said Lottie. "I'll play my new piece, 'Tarn o'Shanter's Ride,' " and the lively girl danced over to the piano and played it vigorously. "I will tell you about Tarn o'Shanter," said Harold. "We had it in our school books," and the boy told something of the ride of Tarn o'Shanter and his old mare Meg. A tub of apples swimming in water was next brought in and they spent a noisy half hour ducking for them. Brother McNab next took the floor and entertained them with a number of old songs. "There was a lad was born in Kyle." "Scots wha hae," etc., piped the quavering old voice. "Let's all sing 'Comin' Thro' the Rye,'" said Jim, and the jolly crowd gathered around the piano again. After the song Brother McNab brought out some picture postals, and a pleasant half hour was spent among the Banks and Braes o'Bonny Scotland. Refreshments were then served by mother assisted by Mara. Dainty squares of gingerbread, shortbread, scones and currant mead were passed around. The evening's pleasure was brought to an end by singing "Auld Lang Syne." The company formed a circle, crossed and then joined hands, and circled round and round while singing. "I like that," lisped baby Lilian as she danced round in glee. "Bobby Burns is all right," echoed the twins and, "we had a fine time. Next month it will be our turn and we will have a patriotic evening for it's Lincoln's and Washington's birthday." "And Valentine day, too," said Jim sleepily. "Good nicht, and God's blessings on ye for your kindly hospitality," said the visitors as they left the happy family group. RECIPE FOR SWEET MILK SCONES. Add sugar, nutmeg and currants to any good biscuit dough and bake either on griddle or in the oven. CURRANT MEAD. To one quart boiling water, add juice of two lemons, one tumbler of currant jelly, and a little cinnamon or nutmeg. Stir until jelly is well mixed. If not sweet enough add sugar.

In these times of high cost of living, it is quite necessary for the good housewife to understand the value of foods, so that in serving a meal, she may get good, nourishing foods, without buying the most expensive. When serving a pound of macaroni, we may be assured of having a much larger amount of nutriment than in a pound of beef steak, and feel also assured that we are saving money as well. We may feel, too, another satisfaction from its use in this, that we are helping to sustain home industry, as we have a splendid grade of macaroni made here at home. A fine variety of spaghetti is also manufactured in Utah, and serves for many useful dishes. Macaroni is a very convenient and easily prepared article of food, and while it is somewhat the same as our bread, it is cooked and served so differently, that it furnishes us a great variety of food. Macaroni should always be cooked in boiling hot, salt water for 30 to 40 minutes before it is used; and, combined with other articles of food, such as grated or sliced cheese, tomatoes, milk, oysters, fish, corn, etc., it makes a delicious dish. We give here a few tested macaroni recipes: Escalloped macaroni with corn. % package macaroni. 1 pt. corn. 1 1/2 cups milk. 2 tablespoons butter. Break macaroni into one inch lengths. Boil 40 minutes in salt water, throw into cold water and drain. Season the corn with salt and pepper, add milk and butter, mix with macaroni, and bake in oven until brown. Cheese may be added for variety, or a little chopped parsley. Macaroni Italienne. 2 lbs. beef. 3 strips of salt pork. 2 sliced onions. l/2 cup mushrooms. 1 quart tomatoes. Yi lb. macaroni. 4f tablespoons grated cheese. Dash cayenne pepper and salt. HOME SCIENCE DEPARTMENT. 27 Cut up beef, salt pork and onions. Place in kettle on the back of stove to cook about Y hour. Then add tomatoes, mushrooms, and simmer for about two hours. Cook macaroni in boiling water 30 minutes, and drain. Put in buttered baking dish, and add all the other ingredients, then season with salt and pepper, and add a layer of grated cheese on top. This is most excellent; try it. To spaghetti which has been boiled in salt water twenty minutes, add one can of tomatoes which have been strained. Cut one green pepper, one red pepper, and take three tablespoons full of sugar. Salt to taste. Add spaghetti to juice of tomatoes, then add 4 tablespoons olive oil or sweet butter just before serving. Boil one-half package of macaroni, drain, and put one layer of macaroni, and alternate with grated cheese in a baking dish, until all the macaroni is used up. Place on top a thick layer of cheese, cover with milk, season with salt and pepper, and bake one-half hour in quick oven. Cold fish may be used with macaroni, instead of the cheese, thus forming another variety of macaroni dishes to be enjoyed by the family. Macaroni and oysters. 1/4 lb. macaroni. 1 can oysters or about 3 dozen fresh oysters. 1/2 cup cream sauce. 1/2 cup of cream. */2Cup grated cheese. 1/2 tablespoon chopped green pepper. Boil macaroni 40 minutes, drain liquor from oysters. Boil and season with salt and pepper. Put in baking dish, placing a layer of macaroni, then oysters; alternate until all has been used. Then sprinkle with chopped pepper, cover with the liquor from the oysters, and cream sauce. Add cheese last, and bake for about 25 minutes. THE MEDICINAL AND HYGIENIC VIRTUES OF THE LEMON. If the testimony of the Sicilian Citrus Chamber is given due consideration in determining the status of a lemon, it deserves an important place in the list of first aids. According to the authority mentioned, the lemon aids are chiefly medicinal and hygienic. Its juice is of value in treating diphtheria and gout. For ordinary colds, it is a great specific. It will cure slight wounds and chilblains. The juice of several lemons taken every day will help to 28 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. cure rheumatism and prove an antidote for diabetes; small slices applied to corns will ease the'pain. As a cleansing agent and beautifier, the reputation of the Union soars still higher. The juice whitens the hands, improves the complexion, helps, if anything can, to remove freckles. In the culinary department, it ranks with salt and sugar in general usefulness, and as a furniture polish its oil is beyond reproach. And yet to be dubbed "a lemon" is considered uncomplimentary!

NOTES Science is doing so much for the woman in her house labors that it would seem impossible to offer any new short-cut in time or in domestic work, and yet, this is exactly what has been done through the invention of one of our Utah boys. , He has devised a cold water washer which will take any ordinary clothes, and especially babies soiled napkins and handkerchiefs, GATES COLD WATER WASHER HOME SCIENCE DEPARTMENT. 29 and whirling them about, without paddle or heat, cleanse them perfectly. The invention is a simple galvanized tin affair in which the water is forced on a tangent from the water tap and the force thus generated whirls the clothes round and round and round, till they are thoroughly cleansed. Dirty clothing, such as underwear and bed linen, needs boiling, but the young inventor declares, and really proves, that such clothing may be dropped dry into boiling suds, left for 20 minutes and then dipped into this machine without wringing, when the clothing is perfectly cleansed of dirt and suds and comes out immaculately clean and spotless. Only one wringing is needed and that the last process of all. The clothes are dipped into the boiler without wringing, dipped out without wringing, out of the machine and then wrung once and hung on the line. Women of long experience who are using the machine and who recommend it heartily, are: Mrs. Julina L. Smith, Mrs. Janette A. Hyde, Mrs. Elizabeth C. McCune, Mrs. Augusta W. Grant, Mrs. Leah D. Widtsoe. who all declare that washing has lost its terrors. A child can use the contrivance, and the whole washing can be done in the bath room over the bath-tub when the clothes are not sufficiently soiled to need boiling. We are glad to recommend any labor-saving device to our readers, and any one who wishes further information  may address The Gates Manufacturing Co.. 672 North First West Street, Salt Lake City, Utah. NOTICE TO AGENTS. In sending in new lists please write names of old subscribers as they were sent in last year, and as they appear on the margin of their Magazine. Also state on lists whether they are old or new subscribers. Notes from the Field. By Amy Brown Lyman, General Secretary. Northwestern States Mission. This picture of the Spokane Relief Society was taken after a work-day meeting held at the home of Mrs. Amelia Guff, President of the Society. Mrs. Guff and her first counselor, Florence Stadelmann, both recently resigned on account of ill health, and Mrs. Julia Miller has been appointed president, with Mrs. Mary Sorenson and Mrs. Pauline Van Cleave as counselors. Mrs. Cora Guff is the secretary, and Mrs. Nellie Kinrade is treasurer. Mrs. Mattie J. Ballard, President of the Northwestern States Relief Society, reports a very successful convention held in the Montana Cooference at Butte. The following interesting items were among those reported: In the Butte Society there are fourteen members enrolled, all of whom are subscribers to the Relief Society Magazine, which makes a l00% ward in that respect. The average attendance is eight. In Anaconda, 50% of the members are subscribers of the Magazine. The Great Falls Society, organized on April 24th. has a membership of five and has a good attendance at the weekly meetings. NOTES FROM THE FIELD. 31 The Helena Society has a membership of eight, average attendance of five. The Dillon branch has, during the year, made eleven quilts and eleven articles of clothing. The Lima Society, just organized, has held only three meetings and has four subscriptions for the Magazine. Eastern States Mission. Sunday, September 24th, was observed in all the branches of the Eastern. States Mission as Genealogical Day. This observance was greatly appreciated by the Relief Society in the Mission, and gave a new impetus to its work. The New York and Brooklyn Relief Societies have been combined into one society, with the following officers: President, Mrs. Bertha Eccles Wright; First Counselor, Mrs. Leona Monson; Second Counselor, Carmen Benson; Secretary, Janetle Easton. A branch of the Relief Society has recently been organized in Albany, New York. The members are taking great interest in their Guide work, and are making use of the splendid genealogical library in the Educational Building of that city. This branch is the infant organization of the Mission, and is. composed of a mere handful of members, but they are very energetic, and are determined to make a success of their Society. The Pittsburg, Pa., Relief Society recently held a bazaar, at which they sold quilts, aprons, and art needle work. During the day, two meals were served. The total receipts were $73.00. After the expenses, which amounted to $15, were taken out, the Society had a balance of $58.00. This is an excellent showing, and especially when we take into consideration that this Society was organized last May, and has an organization of only fifteen members. The West Virginia Society has devoted most of the summer to the making of quilts, and children's dresses for those who suffered the loss of home and property in the spring floods in that locality. Northern States Mission. The Detroit Branch of the Northern States Mission reports some interesting items connected with their summer work. During the months of July and August, a special reading course was provided by the eight members, fifteen books and 335 articles being read by them. Most of this reading was done at home, and was reported and discussed at the meetings. Among the books and articles read were Elias, by O. F. Whitney; Rational Theology, by John A. Widtsoe, and The Other Wise Man, by Van Dyke, and such articles as Senator Reed Smoot's article on "Home Economics," Bulletins on Parental Care, Meats, 32 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. Canned Fruits, and Jellies, Food for the Young, Infantile Paralysis, etc. In a letter from this Mission, we learn that a Mrs. Nogle of Grand Rapids, Michigan, has sent in for Temple purposes $15.00, which she earned picking cucumbers on shares. Mrs. Flora F. Brinkerhoff, President of the Munsey, Ind., Society, writes of a little plan adopted by her organization to raise funds. Each member donated ten cents, and was asked to take the ten cents and make what she could with it in a given length of time. For example, one woman bought one and one-fourth yards of light calico, made three dust-caps and sold each for ten cents, netting thirty cents. She took ten cents of this money and bought one yard of heavy, unbleached muslin, and made a clothespin apron, which she sold for twenty cents. Thus, in a short time, she had made forty cents with the original ten cents as capital. Mrs. Brinkerhoff states that every page of the Magazine is appreciated, and that the contents meet all their needs. Mrs. Georgiana Willard, of Peoria, 111., writes that the MAGAZINE is one of the best papers ever offered for the development of women, adding that the second year is an improvement over the first. Mrs. Bertha Lynday of Indianapolis, Ind., writes appreciatingly of the Theological lessons taken up during the year*. She says, "Our own ideals of true womanhood have been elevate! by the study of these noble women of the Bible who have only too often been underestimated by the sectarian ministers of today." Western States Mission. Mrs. Annie C. Hansen, President of the Boulder, Colorado. Relief Society writes: "We enjoy studying the lessons outlined it-, the Magazine very much. There is a great deal of valuable matter in them. The Magazine, as a whole, is very interesting  so much so. that men are often seen scanning its pages carefully." Snowflake Stake. The Wilford Ward Relief Society has recently sustained a severe loss in the death of their Secretary  Mrs. Adeline H. Savage, a faithful and energetic worker in the organization. Mrs. E. St. Clair Thomas, field secretary of the Congressional Union of the United States, has been in Arizona for some time, soliciting the support of the women of Arizona in the interest of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. Benson Stake. From one small ward in the Benson stake. $25.00 was raised in one month for the Penny Subscription Fund. Parowan Stake. In some of the wards in the Parowan stake NOTES FROM THE FIELD. 33 where it has been impossible to get competent teachers for genealogy,- the brethren have assisted with the class work. Curlew Stake. On July 12th, Curlew stake made an excursion to the Logan Temple, taking 64 Relief Society workers. Raft River Stake. In one of the wards in this stake, a Relief Society member has taken care of a family of seven for five months. This family had just emigrated to this country, and was without a home. They were given this kind care until they could get located. Bannock Stake. The hospital at Soda Springs is visited every day by at least one Relief Society member. In Thatcher First ward, a sister who was sick eleven weeks, was taken care of night and day by Relief Society workers. Pocatello Stake. In a recent Temple excursion from this far-away stake, 20 members visited the Logan Temple. In addition to this visit, a fund of $103.00 was left for work to be hired. Special Donation. Ten dollars was recently sent to the General Board, with the following note attached: "For the Poor." As there was no signature it has been impossible to acknowledge the receipt of the same. The General Board takes this method of expressing gratitude and appreciation for this gift. Genealogy. Senator Reed Smoot recently wrote us that he had sent for the Director of the Census  Mr. Samuel L. Rogers  and had explained to him the necessity of changing the present census to contain the names of the individual's parents, date, and place of birth, in accordance with suggestions made by Mr. Duncan McAllister, late Chief Recorder of the Salt Lake Temple. Mr. Rogers was much interested, and promised to take the matter up at once, adding that this could be done without much extra expense. Mr. Rogers will write to Dr. Alvin Plummer, of San Francisco, head of the Public Records Committee of the International Genealogical Federation with that end in view. The Senator explained to Mr. Rogers that our people are very much interested in genealogy, and thus won the instant sympathy and interest of the director. Reports. The report forms of 1916 and the Teachers' Books for 1917, have been sent out to the stake presidents for distribution to the wards. The Stake Secretaries have been asked to return the compiled stake reports to the General Office by January 15th. Teachers' Books. The Teachers' Books are larger and more complete than they were last year. Because they have been enlarged and because of the increase of the price of paper, the books will cost the wards, delivered  10c each. We especially request the teachers to use the books according to the printed instructions therein. Current Topics. James H. Anderson. Rumaina, having entered the European war field against the Teutonic allies, has been subjected to the grinding process which crushed Servia. German gains in the Balkans, with the exception of those in Macedonia, and about equal German losses on the western front, are the sum of European war progress the past month. Federal control of railways in the United States is being discussed in Congressional circles, with some prospect that action to that end may become an administration program. Peace advocates are becoming urgent for a settlement of the Old World embroilment, but the present outlook is that 1917 will not see the end of the great conflict there. More massacres of Armenians are reported in Turkey. From the accounts given, there would seem to be but few of that class of religionists left in the sultan's dominions. Francis Joseph, emperor of Austria-Hungary for within two weeks of sixty-eight years, died on Nov. 21. and is succeeded by his grand-nephew, Charles Joseph, who takes the title of Charles I. The national policies will be along practically the same lines as heretofore. Simon Bamberger, a well known Utah citizen of Jewish lineage, was elected governor of the State of Utah. It is generally understood that his ability as a business man and as one of the builders of the State will be directed toward giving the people a strictly business administration. Three women were executed in Mexico, during the last week in November, on the charge of having conspired against officials of the Carranza government; and thousands of other women have met death through the regime inaugurated by that government since it came into power. The tax amendment proposed to be made to the Utah State constitution was defeated by a decisive vote of the people, who became convinced that its promoters were making a false pretense in the argument that the amendment was directed chiefly at the mining industry. CURRENT TOPICS. 35 Arabia has broken away from Turkish rule and a new kingdom has been established there, under Hussein Ben Ali, with the national capital at Mecca. Thus the children of Ishmael have been freed from the governmental domination of the Turkish descendants of Japheth. The Church administration building in Salt Lake City will be ready for occupancy early in the year. For its evident convenience, its beautiful appearance, stability, and the commendable use of Utah materials as far as practicable in its construction, the edifice is a source of satisfaction to the thousands who visit it. Mrs. Inez Mulholland Boissevain, who ranked as one of the great equal suffrage workers, although comparatively a young woman, died at Los Angeles just before Thanksgiving. She had become noted both for her womanly graces and her intelligent and forceful yet gentle and determined activity in the cause of woman's political eofranchisement. Vulgar displays in picture shows and illegal resorts in Salt Lake City have received a setback through the arousing of public indignation on the part of the moral portion of the community. It is greatly to the discredit of the present municipal and other authorities that they did not act in proper eoforcement of law until an outraged public sentiment compelled them to do so. There is in the minds of most people a feeling that even now it is spasmodic and not real nor lasting. Miss Jeanette Rankin has been elected to Congress from Montana  the first woman member of the national House of Representatives. As indicated by her name, the young lady is of Scottish descent, and is said to possess the characteristic persistence and logic in argument of that race, with a very pleasing personality which makes friends of many of the intelligent among her antagonists. Her election is a decided advance toward abolishing unequal suffrage, and if Miss Rankin does as well as may be reasonably expected of her from her exemplary career, further forward steps in that direction cannot be far distant. Two "Mormon" missionaries, one in Germany and the other in New Zealand, have been released from military service in those countries, to return to Utah, after nearly two years; the one in Germany having been in several battles on the Verdun front. For a long time they were unable to get a hearing on their American citizenship. EDITORIAL Entered at second class matter at the Post Office, Salt Lake City, Utah. Motto  Charity Never Faileth.

A CALL TO THE WOMEN OF THE CHURCH We call upon our officers and members throughout the Church to give serious consideration to the following letter, recently addressed by the Presidency of the Church to the General Boards of Relief Society, Young Ladies' _ Mutual Improvement Association, and Primary Association. Dear Sisters: We feel that there exists a pressing need of improvement and reform among our young people, specifically in the matter of dress and in their social customs and practices. Our women are prone to follow the demoralizing fashions of the world; and some of the daughters of Zion appear to vie with one another in exhibitions of immodesty and of actual indecency in their attire, wholly forgetful of the precepts of the Lord and the counsels of his servants, and seemingly oblivious in this respect to the promptings and duties of true womanhood. Many of our youth of both sexes are fast approaching a state of depravity in dancing, and in their feverish pursuit of frivolous and dissipating pleasures. We are grateful in knowing that only a fraction of our people are seriously affected by the deadly contagion of Babylon; but those already iofected among the Latter-day Saints are all too many. The conditions call for prompt, determined, and persistent EDITORIAL. 37 action, lest the standard of morality and spiritual health in our community be further impaired. We call upon you. as the chief officers of a great and influential auxiliary within the Church, to give this matter immediate consideration, and to make it the subject of specific effort and systematic missionary labor among the members of your organization and with the people generally throughout the Church. See that your own officers first, and then that your members show by their own example the sincerity of their efforts toward the accomplishment of the purposes of this special mission to which we call you. We advise that you work in harmony with the officers of our other auxiliary organizations; and with this co-operative course in mind, we are sending this appointment concurrently to the General Boards of the Relief Society, the Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement Association, and the Primary Association. For the information  of the General Boards of the Sunday School, the Y. M. M. I. A., and the Religion Class, a copy of this letter will be sent to each of those Boards with the request that they do all within their power to assist in the correction of the evils herein referred to. Inasmuch as one of the most important phases of this reformatory labor has to do with our girls and women, we advise that for the present the General Boards that are composed of women work together as a co-operative unit. You are requested therefore to appoint three of your number as members of a committee; and this committee, consisting of nine members. should straightway set about preparing a plan for effective operation. Let the General Board of the Relief Society determine upon and notify the other organizations of the time and place of the first meeting of the committee, at which first meeting the committee may organize itself by electing a chairman and other necessary officers. We desire to be kept ioformed of your progress in operating under this appointment. With prayerful wishes that the Lord will give you in full measure the spirit of this ministry, and that joy through success will attend your efforts, we are, Your Brethren, Joseph F. Smith, Anthon H. Lund, Charles W. Penrose. In accordance with the instructions given in this letter, a committee was at once appointed, three members from each Board, who should, under the direction of the Boards, put into operation measures leading to improvement along the lines mentioned.  38 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. An organization was effected, a Chairman, Vice-chairman, Secretary, and Assistant Secretary appointed, and a name selected  that of "Social Advisory Committee." These sisters first gave their attention to the subject of dress, as one in which the women and girls of our organizations are vitally concerned. Acting upon the suggestion that our "own officers first, and then that our members show by their example the sincerity of their efforts," a resolution was prepared and unanimously adopted by the three Women's Boards. This resolution was to the effect that each member should be willing to live in harmony with the teachings of the Church in the matter of properly clothing the body. We now earnestly solicit the co-operation of all our women officers and members in this important movement. The responsibility for conditions in our midst which make necessary these instructions from the First Presidency rests upon every women in the Church. No one can evade it. Officers first, and then members should show by example and precept that they gladly join hands with the Authorities of the Church in the endeavor to overcome the evils which exist. The gospel of Jesus Christ offers so much to its recipients that all Latter-day Saints should delight to cooform their lives to its teachings. Its requirements are not harsh and should not be irksome. Our women who have been privileged to enter the House of the Lord have received incomparable blessings  blessings which are a source of joy and comfort here on the earth, and which shall endure throughout eternity. Does any woman in Zion undervalue these rich privileges? Will she not gladly make any sacrifice to be worthy of them? Our young women and girls should strive to understand the teachings of the gospel with regard to dress and conduct, and to live in accordance therewith. In the guise of fashion, many false ideas of beauty have come among us, and the habit of "being in the style" has caught and carried many of us much farther than we realized. Let us remember that the body is a gift from God and that it should be kept sacred. Our girls should be instructed and helped to recognize the value of, and the protection that comes with modesty in dress and conduct. Not one of them can afford to sacrifice such protection for the sake of fashion. We recommend to stake and local officers that this editorial be read in the meetings of our organizations throughout the Church.

Hew Prices When you see women's clubs and men's Are Boosted. civic bodies, and even Congress making a tremendous fuss about the price of eggs and flour, while they say nothing whatever about the shoes and gloves, you get a bit angry  if your sympathies run with the farmers, and that is where Utah's sympathies should be.

Of course, we all know that the middlemen The get the big benefits out of this rise in eggs Middleman. and food stuffs  well so they do from coal and leather. The way society is now organized, the middleman is a necessity, and he has to live and get rich if he can. But the farmer gets better and steadier prices because of the middleman, and the farmer knows it. Of course, the farmer can cut out the middleman, and live on his own produce. But he won't, the modern farmer is too shrewd for that. I don't notice the club women crying out What Do about the rise in feathers and hats. Nor do Women Do I see them wearing any cheaper hats because About High of the unprecedented rise in all fancy goods. Priced No, no!

That's the law of supply and demand. It's only silly folks who expect wages to rise and prices to fall at one and the same time. The sensible thing for you and me, my dear, is just to institute the severest economy we are capable of, refuse to go in debt, save all we can, wear last year's dresses and hats, use as few eggs as may be. and let the pseudo-reformers go their gait. This talk will all die. down, you know. Congress and clubs will spend uselessly a few dollars of money in investigating, and things will end up just where they began. It is. after all, purely a personal matter. If we will each economize and be ready for the crash that is sure to follow, at the close of the war, we can afford to forget all the talk and resolutions while we wait quietly upon the god of war and consequent high prices. CALL FOR HISTORY ITEMS. Our General Historian desires to secure the names, sketches and pictures of all women who were milliners, dressmakers, school teachers, music teachers or midwives in Kirtland, Missouri or Nauvoo. Decsendants who write such sketches will please include the genealogy and pedigrees of the persons described. These sketches will be published in the Deseret News Genealogical Department, while the names will appear in the list of historic women living in the early days of Church history.

THE ABRAHAMIC AGE. According to Taine, a noted French critic, there are three different things which produce the "elementary moral state" of a people: race, surroundings, and epoch. By race he means the "internal structure" of a people, that inherent nature and disposition "which man brings with him into the world," and which makes the different kinds of men we see all around us. "There is a natural variety of men, as of oxen and horses, some brave and intelligent, some timid and dependent, some capable of superior conceptions and creations, some reduced to rudimentary ideas and inventions." By surroundings Taine means whatever goes to influence a people from without. "The profound differences which are manifest between the German races, on the one side, and the Latin and the Greek, on the other side, arise for the most part from the differences between the countries in which they are settled: some in cold, moist lands, deep in rugged, marshy forests or on the shores of a wild ocean, beset by melancholy or violent sensations, prone to drunkenness and gluttony, bent on a fighting, blood-spilling life; others, again, within the loveliest landscapes, on a bright and pleasant sea-coast, enticed to navigation and commerce, exempt from gross cravings of the stomach, inclined from the beginning to social ways, to a settled organization of the state, to feelings and dispositions such as develop the art of oratory, the talent for enjoyment, the inventions, letters, arts." By epochs he means whatever happens to a race in its environment. Now, in Abraham and Sarah the Lord chose a man and a woman through whom to begin a new people or nation. Abraham, we are told, was one of "the noble and great ones," among the pre-existent intelligences; and, no doubt. Sarah was a fit helpmate for such a man. The Hebrew race had therefore the "inherent' structure" necessary for a great people. But the Lord did more than choose a worthy foundation for a great people. He took Abraham and Sarah out of their native 42 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. home and established them in a new land, a land favorable to the development of their descendants along the lines marked out for them by Jehovah. Palestine is a tract of extremely fertile land, about four hundred miles long, and from seventy to one hundred miles wide, lying between the Arabian Desert and the eastern coast of the Lavant. "Syria," says Professor George Adam Smith, (in which is Palestine), "lies between two continents  Asia and Africa: between two primeval homes of men  the valley of the Euphrates and the Nile; between two great centers of empire  Western Asia and Egypt; between all these, representing the Eastern and ancient world, and the Mediterranean, which is the gateway to the Western and modern world." In this central location Palestine became not only the "battle ground of empires," but also and particularly the "highway of nations." In the former respect it resembled the Belgium of modern history, and in the latter respect it was much like our own Salt Lake City, through which people pass from the East to the Pacific coast. By reason of its peculiar position, therefore, the Holy Land was isolated from the other nations, enjoying the consequent opportunity for development along the lines of its own racial possibilities. At the same time there was deposited on its national soil the sediment of civilization of the upper and lower peoples of the ancient world. Besides all this, Palestine is one of the richest countries of the world in its natural resources. Palestine "reproduces climates and zones which, in other countries, are separated by many hundred miles." "Within the extent of a single landscape, there is every climate, from the cold of northern Europe to the heat of India. The oak, the pine, the walnut, the maple, the juniper, the alder, the poplar, the willow, the ash, the ivy, and the hawthorn, grow luxuriously on the heights of Hermon, Basham, and Galilee. Hence the traveler from the more northerly temperate lands finds himself in some parts, surrounded by the trees and vegetation of his own country. ***** The traveler from the more southern countries is no less at home; for from whatever part he come, be it sunny Spain or Western India, he will recognize well known forms in one or the other of such a list as the carob, the oleander and willow, skirting the streams and water-courses; the sycamore, the fig, the olive, the date-palm, the pride of India, the pistachio, the tamerick, the acacia, and the tall tropical grasses and reeds, or in such fruits as the date, the pomegranate, the vine, the orange, the shaddock, the lime, the banana, the almond, and the prickly pear." Palestine, at the time of Abraham, was occupied by Caananitish tribes, barbaric peoples. Abraham and Sarah had come GUIDE LESSONS. 43 thither, obeying a command of God, from Chaldea. The people in their old home were idolators and offered up human beings as sacrifices, men, women, and children. In the Book of Abraham v/e are told that the priest was about to offer up the young man Abraham on the altar. In their new home the chosen pair dwelt from the call to the end of their lives, with the exception of short residences in Egypt. Whenever we think of Abraham and Sarah in Palestine we must not think of them as we sometimes do, in the midst of modern conditions. They did not live in a vast and wealthy kingdom. The "kings" mentioned in Genesis were but chiefs of tribes. Abraham with his "trained men born in his house, three hundred and eighteen," is represented as pursuing a number of these rebellious kings "as far as Dan," smiting them and their followers right and left. "And he brought back all the goods (which they had stolen from Lot, his brother's son), and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people." In those days a man's wealth was measured by the things which he possessed. Pharaoh "had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she-asses, and camels." Abraham too "was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold." Lot "had flocks, and herds, and tents." Sarah's household duties, if we may use the term "house" at Vil, were confine d to the tent. For when the angel appeared to Abraham just before the destruction of the wicked cities, the patriarch was sitting "in his tent door in the heat of the day," under "the oaks of Mamre." Moreover, they did more or less wandering from place to place, after the manner of herdsmen in those remote days. Abraham and Sarah lived a more or less nomadic life. In this wonderful land, under these conditions, the Hebrew race began its long and splendid career. We shall see in later articles how it was that this environment was used and modified to suit their growing needs. QUESTIONS. What has environment to do with the development of a race? Of an individual? Show that Palestine is so situated and is of such a character as to contribute to the isolation and development of the Jews. What may have been the Lord's purposes in establishing Israelites in the Palestine? Describe Palestine. Describe customs in the days of Abraham. What differences do you find in religion, in occupations, and in general manners then and now? Prove your statements. 44 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE.

SURNAMES FROM THE VILLAGE When the English people, as they had begun to call themselves, after William the Conqueror's day, really decided to adopt surnames, some of them fell naturally into the habit of calling themselves by their trades, or professions, or offices. This would come natural, as: William the tailor would soon be William Taylor; John the clerk would soon become John Clerk or Clark; and Richard the gardener would soon become Richard Gardner. It may clarify this lesson if we say a little more about the Domesday Book and the census made by William the Conqueror, in 1086. William found it impossible to decide just who held deeds to certain properties, nor did he know how many men he had under him, nor how much property was in the kingdom. Partly to take a census, and partly to find out how much taxable property there was, and partly to fasten his yoke more securely upon the necks of the conquered Angles, Saxons and Danes, he sent heralds all through the kingdom, and these heralds wrote the results of their census, taken in a very fine hand and, in a very crowded manner, upon a medium-sized manuscript book, which was called The Domesday Book, and which is now in the f fall of Records, under a glass case in London. GUIDE LESSONS. 47 Baring-Gould says: "Commissioners were sent into the shires, who took evidence on oath from the sheriffs, the parish priests, the reeves, and the men generally, French and English alike, in every lordship. They were to report who had held the land in the time of Edward the Coofessor, and who held it then; also as to how many lived on it, what was their quality and what was the value of the soil, and whether there was any prospect of the value being raised. "The Chronicle says: 'He sent over all England, into every shire, his men to find out how many hundred hides were in the shire, and what the King himself had of land and cattle in the land. Also what rights he ought to have in the twelve months in the shire. Also he let enquire how much land his Archbishops had, and his Bishops, and his Abbots, and his Earls, and though tell it at more length, what and how much every man had that was a land-holder in England, in land or in cattle, and how much fee it was worth. So very narrowly did he let the investigation be carried out, that there was not a single hide, nor a yard of land, not so much as  it is a shame to tell it, and he thought it no shame to do it not an ox nor a cow, nor a swine, was left that was not set in his writ. And all the writs were brought to him.' that "The broke taking out in of this inquisition tumults, and some roused great blood shed was dissatisfaction Hitherto the landholders, with a little shuffling and some bribing, had been able to assess their lands lower than their actual value. This would now be impossible, and they looked to the hard hand of the tax-gatherer coming down on them and remorselessly squeezing out the due for every acre, whether in cultivation or fallow. From Domesday we learn what were the several classes among the English who were now under the heel of the Norman. "The old Thegns, or land-holders, were no longer great men; they had to bow their necks under the yoke, and see their land taken from them and their influence and authority gone. Some, luckily, remained on as tenants on the land where they had been freeholders, and in remembrance of the past still called themselves Thegns, or Theins, and continued to be so called. Hence it comes that we have the surname of Thynne. "The Freemen, freeholders, held their land after the Conquest no longer as freemen, but subject to military service, and were taxable. Their representatives later were the yeomen. They have contributed to our nomenclature the names Freeman and Free. Freebody signified a freeholder of a little wooden cot. Fry as a surname comes thence as well. "Radmen were socmen, possessed of a greater amount of freedom than others. Hence the surname Redman. "Socmen, inferior landowners who held their lands in the 48 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. soc, or franchise, of a great lord. Hence Suckerman, Suckman. "Franklyn was much the same as the Freeman." The surnames which grew out of the offices held by the village proprietors were: Bonder. The old Norse bonde was the man in highest position under the Earl. He was the freeholder, responsible to none save the Earl. Burs or Geburs were workmen giving a certain number of days' of the work in the field's, and a small money payment to the Lord of the Manor. Bordars, a poor but numerous class, tenants of land which, their lord kept expressly for the maintenance of his table, the rental being paid in kind. Cottars and Cottrels, also Cotmens, Coscets. The cottar could hold nothing of his own, nor acquire anything without the consent of his lord. The Cottrell was in no better position. Villeins were men in the servitude of the Lord of the Manor, who held the folkland, by which they supported themselves and their families. They stood somewhat higher than the serfs. They were also designated as knaves. The odium attaching to a class so low has stood in the way of the name passing into our family nomenclature, at all events in its Norman-French form. But it remains as Churl for Ceorl. * * * * * Carl signifies a man generally. Charles is rarely found as a Christian name in England before the time of Charles I. The surnames Charles, Charly and Caroll, from the Latin form Carolus, remain with us  the last in the United States. Serf, the poor wretch who owned nothing of his own but his wife and his children, is only recognizable in family names as Server, Sewer. Servant became Sergeant, and rose to be an official. Thrall was given the surname Thrale. Akerman occurs repeatedly in the Hundred Rolls, and seems to mean a plowman. (Aker-field, hence man of the field.) Man, in Latin, homo, occurs in almost every page of the Domesday Survey, and included every kind of deutero tenant. Badger, properly a Bagger. "Up to the seventeenth century an ordinary term for one who had a special license to purchase com from farmers at the provincial markets and fairs, and then dispose of it again elsewhere, without the penalties of engrossing."(Bardsley.) Barker, the man who barks for the tanner; Barkis is "at the Bark-house." Bercher or Berger, a shepherd. A Norman-French name is little used, yet surviving as a surname. Beemaster.

Farmer remains on the land, and has contributed to our nomenclature. Also Fermor. Farrer and Farrier, the man who shoes horses. Fearon is a smith; also Ferrier. Fowler is a common surname, and explains its origin. This is sometimes contracted to Fowles and Fowle; also Vowler. Hayman or Hayward was the village official whose duty it was to guard the cattle that grazed on the village common, that they did not trespass on the ground where was the grass grown for hay during the winter. Until hedges became common, the hayward had to keep a sharp lookout on the cattle committed to his charge.

THE AUTHOR AT WORK. Literature that lives is born alive. The writer must put his heart into his work, must feel what he says; otherwise, though he "speak with the tongue of men and of angels," his words will be but "sounding brass and tinkling cymbal." A little story told of Bret Harte, the California writer, illustrates beautifully this point. It is said that one of his poems once found its way into a San Francisco paper. A certain lady 52 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. was so charmed with it that she went to the writer and said enthusiastically, "Why, Mr.Harte, that is the best thing you ever wrote; I actually cried when I read it." "That is not at all strange," replied he,  "not at all strange. I cried when I wrote it." Sincerity is the soul of literature. The author, stirred by an emotion, or burning with some message, expresses himself to share with others, his thoughts and feelings, or to relieve his own soul. If his words ring true, they thrill the hearts that hear or read them. This message may be given in the form of a sermon, or a song, or a story. Most of our literature can.be grouped under these three general types. Different writers choose one or another of these ways of reaching their audiences. A striking illustration of this is found in the literary work of a certain American family. When the question of slavery was paramount in our nation, the people were naturally very much aroused. Among those who were ardent workers for the freedom of the slaves, were members of the Beecher family. From his famous pulpit in Brooklyn, Henry Ward Beecher was thundering his sermons against the evil; while Harriet Beecher Stowe, his sister, was writing her famous story, Uncle Tom's Cabin; and about the same time Julia Ward Howe, their cousin, created that greatest of civil war songs, "The reads as Battle follows Hymn: of the Republic," the last stanza of which "In the beauty of the lilies, Christ was born across the sea. With a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me,  As he died to make men holy, let us die to make men free, While God is marching on." The same end was thus reached by three different literary paths: the sermon, the song, and the story. And these famous authors were splendidly successful because their words rang with sincerity. Indeed, some feel that in their earnestness, they were carried a little beyond the bounds of strict fairness, as is frequently the case when one grows over-zealous for any cause. But, ' nevertheless, literature, without fire, can hardly light the minds of men and stir them to action. The sermon and the story may both be written, either in form of verse or prose. The song, being more musical in effect, is written only in verse. This is not to say, however, that prose is necessarily unmusical. Prose has its rhythm as well as does verse. What then is the difference? Mainly this: The rythm. or musical movement, of verse is measured. It moves with GUIDE LESSONS. h$ regular cadence, having regularly accented syllables; one can beat time to it; as, Life is real, life is earnest, And the grave is not its goal: Dust thou art, to dust returnest Was not spoken of the soul."  -Longfellow. Prose which is literature or which contains the elements of beauty on the other hand, has a freer rythm. Its movement is not regular; but it is musical, just the same. Listen to any choice selection in prose; listen to even the freest conversation, and observe that words fall naturally into a kind of musical grouping. The rythm of prose is more like the music of the mountain stream. Now it leaps, now it eddies, now it babbles, now it flows quietly; one can hardly guess what next it may do. The music of verse may be compared to that of the waves of lake or sea, breaking with rythmic cadence upon the shore. Prose, however, in its most eloquent forms, sometimes moves with almost the rythmic swing of verse. For illustration: "Union and liberty, now and forever, one and inseparable."  Webster. "Peace on earth, good will towards men."  St. Luke. "How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord, Is laid for your faith in his excellent word."  Kirkham. Have some good reader voice this touchingly beautiful letter also, and listen to the musical flow of its lines: Dear Madam: November 21, 186-1. I have been shown, in the files of the War Department, a statement from the Adjutant General of Massachusetts, that you are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle. I feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine which should attempt to beguile you from a loss so overwhelming. But I cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of a Republic they died to save. I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom. Yours very sincerely and respectfully, Abraham Lincoln. To Mrs. Bixby, Boston, Mass. 54 'RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. Prose may be very formal or very free. Verse likewise may move with stately step, as in Milton's Paradise Lost, or it may be trippingly light as in a Mother Goose Rhyme. The nature of the verse or prose is always dependent on the kind of thought or emotion to be expressed. Writers try to make the language form in which their thought is clothed fitting, true to the spirit of the message or picture of life they are trying to give. Most of the literature produced today comes in prose form. In earlier days, practically all of it was in verse. Prose, being freer, expresses best the spirit of freedom of this age. The song, or lyric, of course, must always be written in verge. It is interesting to know and well to remember that there are three great types of verse: 1. The Classic, or rhymed verse, created by the Greek poets; 2. The Biblical, or parallel verse, given to the world by the Hebrews; 3. The Blank, or unrhymed verse, first produced by the English poets of the time of Queen Elizabeth. Each of these types comes in a variety of forms; but one can readily recognize to which type a poem belongs, by remembering the chief characteristic of the type. For example: The Classic type is written in rhymes; as, "As some tall cliff that lifts its awful form Swells from the vale and midway leaves the storm. Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread Eternal sunshine settles on its head." From "The Deserted Village."  Goldsmith. Biblical verse does not rhyme, but the thought it expresses is repeated in other words in parallel lines: as, "Intreat me not to leave thee, And to return from following after thee; For whither thou goest, I will go; And where thou lodgest, I will lodge; Thy people shall be my people, And thy God my God; Where thou diest, will I die, And there will I be buried; The Lord do so to me, And more also, If aught but death part thee and me." From "Ruth" 1:16-17. Note that every other line might be omitted, and still the full thought would be kept. This is the simplest form of Biblical GUIDE LESSONS. 55 verse. Many variations from this simple form are made. The Bible contains a great many poems in parallel verse. We are not sc likely to recognize them, however, since in the King James translation these poems are not given in their literary form. But read the Psalms, or many of the Proverbs, and note their parallel structure. It is comparatively easy to write them in verse form, as has been done with the little lyric given from Ruth. as, Blank Verse does not rhyme; but it is regularly rhythmic; "The quality of mercy is not strained; It droppeth as the gentle dew from heaven Upon the place beneath. It is twice blessed; It blesseth him that gives and him that takes."  From "Merchant of Venice" Shakespeare. All of Shakespeare's plays are done in blank verse; so is "Paradise Lost" by Milton; and Tennyson's "Idyls of the King," as well as the poems of many other writers. It is a stately kind of verse, well fitted to express great thoughts, as well as stirring ones. Yet, as was said in the beginning, it is the life of the selection that counts most, not the form. The soul is more than the body in literature as in life. In selecting books for the home, mothers should try to choose those that are alive, that are sincere, that have a pure soul. Only such literature gives a spiritual uplift. LESSON OUTLINE. 1. What do these words from the apostle mean to you?  "Though I speak with the tongue of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am as a sounding brass and tinkling cymbal." Apply this saying to the work of the author. 2. What three different forms does the literary production generally take? 3. Let each be prepared to give some quotation from the sermon type of literature. Use the Sermon on the Mount, or other sayings of the Savior, or give a choice proverb from the Bible, or some passage from the Book of Mormon or Doctrine and Covenants, or from the speeches from our leaders. The quotation should be only a line or two in length; as, "Neither do I condemn thee; go and sin no more." 4. Name some story in verse, in prose. ~~ 5. What is the essential difference between verse and prose?1 6. Let each class member be prepared to give a choice quotation from some poem in rhymed verse; as, 56 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. "Tis always morning somewhere, and above The awakening continents, from shore to shore Somewhere the birds are singing ever more."- -Longfellow. Students may use the hymn book, or any collection of poems tor this purpose. "God moves in a mysterious way, his wonders to perform; He. plants his footsteps in the sea, and rides upon the storm." 7. Find, in one of the Psalms, or elsewhere in the Bible, two or more lines that illustrate parallel verse; as, "It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, And to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High." Psalm 92. 8. From the plays of Shakespeare or from some other English poet, give a brief example of unrhymed, or blank verse; as, "This above all: to thine ownself be true, and it must follow, as the night the day. Thou canst not then be false to any man."  -'From "Hamlet"  Shakespeare. 9. What second guiding principle for parents in selecting literature for the home would you give? LESSON IV. Home Economics Fourth Week in February. II. CORRECT NURSING HABITS Perhaps a larger percentage of trouble in infants  is due to improper nursing habits than from any other cause. It is difficult to impress upon mothers the necessity of regularity in the feeding of their babies. If you will just stop to consider the fact that a baby's digestive apparatus requires rest just as much as does the adult it will help you to realize the necessity for correct habits of nursing. At least one-half of the cases of colic during the first three months of life, with restlessness at night and in many cases imperfect development, are due to a failure upon the GUIDE LESSONS. 57 part of the mother to observe regular periods in the nursing of her baby. Doctors vary as to the interval proper interval. The condition of the baby should determine that should be adopted. A baby that is undernourished at birth, that is deficient in its physical development, should be put upon the two hour interval. Very frequently, however, mothers through their over-anxiety for their babies will attempt to do too much for them so that the. mother is not always the best judge as to whether a child is poorly nourished or not. The normal child  and by normal I mean the child that averages seven and one-half pounds at birth, and makes a steady gain of from four to six ounces a week  should be put upon the three hour interval. If this is adopted as a rule mothers will save themselves lots of sleepless nights and save their babies a great deal of colic. The four hour interval is of value in case-" where there is excessive vomiting or where colic and green stool? do not clear up on the three hour interval. Very frequently mothers tell me that they are regular in their nursing intervals, but upon close inquiry I find that they are guessing at the intervals. This should not be attempted. Nursing intervals should be regulated by the clock. The rule for the normal infant is 6, 9, 12 a.m., 3, 6, and 9 p. m. Prior to four months of age only one nursing at night. These nursing hours should be the same for every day  not 6 o'clock one morning and 7 o'clock the next. Tram the child early to form regular habits and he will soon awaken regularly at the nursing period and fall off to sleep again immediately after nursing. I cannot be too emphatic in impressing this point upon mothers. Many children are raised successfully on the irregular nursing periods, but that does not necessarily mean that they would not have done better if they had been on the regular periods. The question often arises in the mind of the mother as to whether or not her baby is getting enough milk. There is only one way to determine this, and that is by the scales. Frequently a mother will call up a doctor with the complaint that her baby is not getting enough to eat. It is the doctor's place to insist on a careful observation of the baby's weight, taken immediately before and after nursing for every nursing period through twenty-four hours. This gives us in ounces the total amount of milk that the baby obtains in that period. If the baby gets sufficient quantity the quality of the milk can be determined only by an observation of the daily gain in weight over a period of from one to two weeks. A normal gain of from four to six ounces per week is pretty conclusive that the quality of the milk is all right, other things being equal. The idea of sending the milk to the doctor for analysis is not reliable for the reason that no doctor is prepared to make a complete analysis of the milk. Only an expert chemist could accomplish that analysis. The fat content of the milk can 58 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. be determined approximately by the doctor through a simple test, but to analyze the milk is out of the question, the scales being the only practical method of determining not only the quantity of milk the baby is receiving, but the quality of the milk. The mother's nipples should be cleansed at all times before the baby is allowed to nurse. This protects the child against the entrance into the mouth of any infection. The routine washing of the baby's should be condemned mouth with boricreason for the acid solution that moreis or a practice that less of that solution enters the child's stomach and without doubt in time will produce digestive disturbances. Plain warm water is practically of as much value as the boric acid when used over long periods of time. The widespread use of the pacifier to quiet the baby should be condemned because of the danger of infection. It is practically impossible to keep it clean. Germs accumulate around the base of the pacifier that are readily introduced into the mouth of the child. Dysentery, "the great captain of death" in iofancy, is frequently due to this. In occasional cases the pacifier does have its uses, but the habit of using it with every baby is to be unqualifiedly condemned. C. Weaning the Baby. The average child should be weaned from nine to twelve months of age. Mother's milk is deficient in some of the mineral salts, particularly iron. During the first year of the child's life there is enough of this iron stored up in the baby's tissues to supply the demand of the body. This supply becomes depleted by the end of the first year, and if the baby is nursed beyond that time, although he may be fat: the tissues will be flabby, and his development will be handicapped. The vitality is thus lowered and baby is more susceptible to all of the acute infections. Frequently mothers assume the responsibility of weaning the child prior to the nine months because of their fear that the baby is not getting enough from the breast. No mother should assume this responsibility. The conditions in which mother's milk is deficient as a food for the infant are so rare that they really need not be considered. The mother's milk is the ideal food. We cannot possibly duplicate it. and to deprive your baby of that food prior to the nine months is to interfere with his physical development. Usually the mother's diet can be modified to suit the needs of the developing infant. This should always be attempted under the direction of a competent physician before weaning is ever considered. The baby should be weaned gradually. The, appearance of teeth is nature's signal for the introduction of other foods. GUIDE LESSONS. 59 Normally the first teeth appear at six months of age. If the mother begins to introduce a crust of dry bread at this time, with later on small amounts of the gruels well cooked, by the time the baby is nine or ten months of age weaning would be a very small matter. A very good plan is to accustom the child to take one bottle of modified milk daily, so that when the breast is withheld the child will take to the bottle without any trouble. What has been your experience in regulating the intervals of the baby's feedings? Discuss the advisability of eliminating the night feeding by the time the baby is three months old. How many mothers have made use of the scales in the raising of their babies? What do you think about the pacifier? Does it influence in any way the development of the bones of the face? Have you in your experience found it difficult to keep the pacifier clean? Have you noticed the pallor and flabby condition of the babies that have been nursed beyond the first year? In a previous lesson we learned what the diet of the nursing mother should be. Bearing this in mind, how would you proceed to modify the breast milk through the mother's diet?

We are delighted to give place to the following clear and exact statement by Dr. E. G. Peterson, President of the Agricultural College of Utah, as it outlines our views and defines our own position, with clearness and precision. We heartily agree with Dr. Peterson in the following open letter which he has written: "It is the policy of the college to avoid forming organizations of women for the study of home economics wherever existing organizations are prepared to go ahead with the work. For that reason it is not recommended by the college that the women form home economic associations if, in the opinion of the women and their leaders, the Relief Society home economics section, meeting once each month, will be sufficient to do the work. It is my opinion that as far as possible extra organizations should be avoided. "At the same time there are many communities where home economics associations, separate and distinct, will probably be necessary. This is a question for the women to decide among themselves. It is strongly urged, however, that anything in the nature of competitive organizations be avoided. Two organizations with the same purpose in view in the same locality should be avoided. It is strongly suggested that by all means the work should be united. "The college looks upon the education of women in home economics as one of the greatest educational opportunities of our day. There is more wastage of life and labor and wealth due to lack of understanding of the home and of the family than from any other cause. "I am told that in America every year 400,000 babies and young children die, and that 200,000 of these deaths are prevent able. What an opportunity for enlightened motherhood. What a privilege it is to teach these things of modern science and art, that means so much to the human race. Utah women, already known for their devotion and their high idealism, have an opportunity to develop this great science and art as it is develop* I nowhere else. "All Relief Society workers will be interested in the new course in 'mothercraft' being given at the Agricultural College jot Utah, for the first time by any educational institution in America. In these courses the girls are definitely trained for the responsibilities of motherhood by caring for children aa part of their work. Many letters of inquiry and congratulation from all parts of the country indicate among other things, the unusual interest in this subject. The mothercraft' work is part of the course in home economics, and promises to become one of the most popular fields in our education." PARADISE LOST. Hazel Washburn.
