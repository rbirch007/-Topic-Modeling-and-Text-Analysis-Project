THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE VOL. 38, NO. 1 JANUARY 1951 A Tlew Year Wish The approaching year 1951 sails from the horizon freighted with fears and blessings, with despair and joy, and each person will unload from its cargo that portion which he chooses for his own. Moreover, each individual may lay hold an anchor to his soul which will keep him from drifting to his destruction onto the shoals of unbelief and unrighteousness. Ether describes this anchor in these' words: "Therefore whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world... Which hope cometh of faith, making an anchor to the souls of men." It is the wish of the general board that, during the year 1951, service in Relief Society may strengthen Latter-day Saint women, "'making them sure and steadfast, always abounding in good works, being led to glorify God." This service will return to bless the giver and will increase her hope and faith to forge an anchor to weight her soul in the stream of eternal life. May the New Year bring these rich blessings and joy to all Relief Society members. Affectionately, BELLE S. SPAFFORD MaArIANNE C. SHARP VELMA N. SIMONSEN General Presidency Sy iS ile om She Fleart Will Sind Lt Dorothy J. Roberts. There should be, always, some rich echo stored Within the spirit's vault as flaming dower, Some golden fruitage of a season kept As sustenance saved for a darkened hour. There is one long, unbroken thoroughfare From grace to grace forever for such eyes; The heart will find it, if it has not yet, The heart, grown glad, will learn it—and be wise. Then shall beauty have no death nor end, For when the autumn fades there is the dream, The lucent amber threaded on the mind, The coral heaped as by the canyon stream. Memory can bridge the winter's white abyss And stir the flame still embered in its sight, The little space till glory shall return In some new guise, and all the land be bright. ~The Cover: Cabin at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Photograph by Ray Loomis. Cover Design by Evan Jensen. Ernest L. Wilkinson, President of Brigham Young University Ivor Sharp Executive Vice-President, Radio Service Corporation of Utah (KSL—KSL-TV) NE cannot work with Ernest L. Wilkinson without recognizing and appreciating his great ability. Also, one is soon impressed with the meticulous and scholarly way he goes about his work, with the vast amount of energy that he puts into it, and the steady way he moves forward with dogged determination, plowing into the furrow behind him all of the disappointments and _ discouragements that may have beset his efforts. And, quickly, one will observe that here is a man who places his Church obligations first; a person never too busy for Church service. To set aside for a later day a measure of worldly success that might be had today; to postpone home comforts comparable to those enjoyed by one's friends; to curtail entertainment and to stand with a tiny group in a great city for a cause, takes faith, courage, and the will-todo—all essential qualities of leadership. Ernest L. Wilkinson did that. In so doing, he was sustained by a small group of friends who did likewise, but none of them gave more generously of time, ability, means, and energy. And in the background he had the full support of his wife, Alice Ludlow Wilkinson. Alice, loved and respected by all her associates, moved with quiet and gentle dignity. Endowed with an unusual intellect and devoted to her Church, she kept their home in good order, joined her husband in Church service, and serenely and cheerfully met each day with calm assurance. In those New York days President Wilkinson was associated with the law firm of Charles Evans Hughes, then Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court. He had been selected for a position in this firm on the basis of his excellent record at Harvard Law School. He had earned and won the right to test his legal ability in company with men standing high in that profession. And if he were to succeed, he would do so by reason of his own ability and strength of character; there was no one supporting him for any other reason. During those years and all the years since, he worked each day and well into the night. Often he undertook assignments that others considered too unlikely of success. The four legal cases involving claims for settlement from the United States Government to certain Ute Indian tribes were undertaken by him after others had decided the prospects too improbable. For over fifteen years Ernest L. Wilkinson fought in behalf of his Indians. He was facetiously referred to as "that Indian man." His greatest trial during that period was that of staving off discouragement. And anyone closely associated with President Wilkinson will understand Page 5 6 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1951 that days are very dark indeed when he despairs. Many times he would be seen briefly in Salt Lake City, when he was hurrying to or from some Indian reservation. In Washington he was ever working and rushing; his office seemed literally bulging with work and _ activity. Into those cases on behalf of the Indians he poured his full ability, his vast source of energy, and practically all of his own resources, excepting only that part of his life always reserved for his Church. The magnitude, as well as the importance, of the decision recently handed down by the Court may better be understood from the following: 1. The Court awarded final judgments in the four cases aggregating $31,938,473. The largest prior final judgment ever entered by the United States Court of Claims was around $7,000,000 plus interest. 2. One hearing in the Court of Claims on one of the Ute cases involved over 11,000 pages of testimony and 23,000 pages of exhibits. 3. One of the hearings was the longest continuous hearing on trial in the history of the United States Court of Claims. 4. Work on these cases extended over a period of more than fifteen years. 5. Relative to the services of President Wilkinson, the Honorable Seth W. Richardson, formerly Chairman of the President's Loyalty Board and now Chairman of the Subversive Activities Control Board, in testifying before the United States Court of Claims recently, stated: "Neither you nor I ever had an opportunity to contact human work in the profession of the law that compares to this case. It is the most extraordinary thing I ever saw.' HEN success comes to one under such conditions, those on the outside, those who have little knowledge of what has gone before, are prone to be mindful only of the moment. To them the disappointments, the difficulties, and the darkness along the way are not understood. 'They fail to comprehend the sheer tenacity necessary, at times, to continue the work; to appreciate that most of that time, victory, if ever to be attained, seemed so very far away. To pursue wisely, intelligently, relentlessly, doggedly, the ramifications of law cases of that nature takes the kind of substance that only leaders possess. President Wilkinson's resolute steadfastness is further evidenced by his strict adherence to principle. No matter how great the financial pressure upon him, and most of the time during those "Indian" years and earlier, it was heavy indeed, he always found a way to pay his tithing. He believed in the law of tithing and honored it, he had the strength of purpose to hold to standards and ideals. 'That is the way he conducts his life; that manner of living explains why he won his cases, why he succeeds in doing the things he undertakes. Accordingly, to those who knew him, it was not surprising that when a new president of the Brigham Young University was to be selected the name of Ernest L. Wilkinson was soon heard as a possible choice. He has always had a love for the institution, as has his wife, Alice; and this love they have passed down to their children. Their son Ernest L. Graduated from the "Y" in 1946; their daughter Marian, in 1949; a daughter Alice Ann is at present a ERNEST L. WILKINSON " Photograph by Glogau PRESIDENT ERNEST L. WILKINSON AND FAMILY Alice Ludlow Wilkinson; Marian; Alice Ann; Douglas (sitting in front); Ernest Ludlow, M. D.; David; Dr. Ernest L. Wilkinson. Student there. President Wilkinson has demonstrated his devotion and loyalty to the Church; his training has prepared him for the great responsibility of being President of the Bigham Young University. ITH ripening wisdom he approaches his task humbly. He exhibits a spirit of deep appreciation for those who, in the past, have served, as well as for those who are now serving Brigham Young University; for all that the faculty and others have done to build a great institution. Upon the announcement of his selection as president of the University, he made the following statement, which is significant: I accept in a spirit of humility and with the hope I may be of assistance to the great faculty of that institution in causing the Brigham Young University to fulfill the measure of its destiny. Because I am convinced that the ills of the world will never be cured by purely political action whether that action be translated into international pacts, atom bombs, burdensome armament, or otherwise. I welcome the opportunity of returning to my alma mater where chief emphasis is placed on individual responsibility and 8 righteous living—the only key to personal and international peace. I anticipate, barring another world conflagration, that it will not be many years until the Brigham Young University will have a regular enrollment of around 10,000 students, who will come from all parts of the Christian world. Already over fifty per cent of its students come from without the State of Utah, nearly every State being represented. I will be happy to devote my energies to encouraging that growth. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1951 President Wilkinson will work with the faculty and with others concerned to make the Brigham Young University a leader in all fields of University training. He and Mrs. Wilkinson attended the exercises commemorating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the University held the week of October 16, 1950, and they will move to Provo shortly after January 1, 1951.

Snow Poem Contest HE Relief Society general board is pleased to announce the names of the three prize winners in the 1950 Eliza R. Snow Poem contest. This contest was announced in the June 1950 issue of the Magazine, and closed September 15, 1950. The first prize of twenty-five dollars is awarded to Alice Morrey Bailey, Salt Lake City, Utah, for her poem "Lot's Wife." The second prize of twenty dollars is awarded to Julia M. Nelson, Mountain View, Alberta, Canada, for her poem "Old Home." The third prize of fifteen dollars is awarded to Ruth H. Chadwick, Salt Lake City, Utah, for her poem "Pioneer Wagon Wheels." This poem contest has been conducted annually by the Relief Society general board since 1932, in honor of Eliza R. Snow, second general president of Relief Society, a gifted poet and beloved leader. The contest is open to all Latterday Saint women, and is designed to encourage poetry writing, and to increase appreciation for creative writing and the beauty and value of poetry. Prize-winning poems are the property of the Relief Society general board, and may not be used for publication by others except upon written permission from the general board. The general board also reserves the right to publish any of the other poems submitted, paying for them at the time of publication at the regular Magazine rate. A writer who has received the first Page 10 prize for two consecutive years must wait two years before she is again eligible to enter the contest. There were one hundred eleven poems submitted in this year's contest, as compared with ninety-seven entered last year. Many of the poems submitted this year revealed beauty of thought, and nearly all of the subjects of the entries were based upon an interesting and significant theme. Sixteen states and the Dominion of Canada were represented in this year's contest, the largest number of entries coming from Utah, with seventeen from California, ten from Idaho, seven from Colorado, six from Arizona, four from Nevada, three from Massachusetts, two each from Florida, Washington, Oregon, Wyoming, and Canada. One entry each came from Texas, Wisconsin, Montana, Minnesota, and Connecticut. _ | One of the 1950 prize winners has received previous awards in the Eliza R. Snow Poem Contest, and two new poets are represented. The general board congratulates the prize winners and expresses appreciation to all entrants for their interest in the contest. The general board wishes, also, to thank the judges for their care and diligence in selecting the prizewinning poems. The services of the poetry committee of the general board are very much appreciated. The prize-winning poems, _together with photographs and _ biographical sketches of the prize-winning contestants, are published herewith. Prize -Winning Preis Glas Roxey Orie Wancdeal (nam Gerucst ALICE MORREY BAILEY First Prize Poem stots WLW e Alice Morrey Bailey She merely turned for one last, stolen look Before her woman's lingering mind forsook The home her hands had decked, her smile made sweet, The memories of her children in the street. A spirit, set on right, must keep front-face Forever rigid toward the chosen place And eyes firm-narrowed in the lane of duty. No wayside resting place and no lush beauty Should tempt the soul to longing, no lost Love or glory, and no treasure mete their cost In nostalgic indecision, not even pity For a wanton, doomed, and wicked city, Lest the will be drawn into the sucking blaze, Consumed to smoke and ash. The backward gaze Can bend desire, compel the step to halt, And slowly, slowly turn the heart to salt. Page 11 12 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1951 JULIA M. NELSON Second Prize Poem Old Home Julia M. Nelson Come this way, it is softer even now To walk where he has labored with his plow Between these rows; how proudly tall they stand That once were saplings on the barren land. Not that way; tangled vines have overrun The garden path... She stood there in the sun To breathe the warming fragrance of her flowers; She bought their beauty with such precious hours! Step lightly, for the robins come each spring To rear their nestling brood beside the swing; They loved the laughing noise that children made. The silence has been long... They are afraid. Come softly through the door; the house is old, Love's fire is out, the sheltering walls are cold... The windows dark where shone a sacred light Of trust and harmony into the night. Pray humbly that the choice and fruitful years Upon this altar laid with joy... With tears May reach to heaven from this dead home, until It stands a city, set upon a hill! PRIZE-WINNING POEMS RUTH HORSLEY CHADWICK Third Prize Poem Pioneer Wagon WVheels Ruth H. Chadwick They screeched against the river's icy crust And groaned in protest to the freezing night; Behind, the inky skies were red with lust, A crimson emblem formed by fires of might. Through dust-green grasses, seared by summer's sun, They cut with steady unrelentless pace A double line of etching, slowly spun Across the lonesome prairie's swarthy face. They strained beneath perpetual wear and weight, Defying nature's cruel, untamed force Of ruthless weather spelling out their fate, And craggy mountain peaks that blocked their course. They built new worlds for men who would be free; Then on they rolled to their eternity. 13 Biographical Sketches of 6liza KR. Snow Poem Contest Winners Alice Morrey Bailey, musician, composer, sculptor, artist, and writer, is a remarkably gifted Latter-day Saint woman. Alice and her husband, DeWitt Bailey, have three children. Mrs. Bailey has served in all of the Church auxiliary organizations and is now organist in the Sunday School of the Eleventh Ward, Salt Lake City. The literary work of Mrs. Bailey has been recognized by many publications and has received awards in several contests. Readers of The Relief Society Magazine are familiar with Mrs. Bailey's poems, many of them frontispieces, and with her excellent short stories and serials which have appeared from time to time in the Magazine. Her story, "The Wilderness," placed first in the 1941 Annual Relief Society Short Story Contest, and "The Ring of Strength" placed second in 1945. In the 1948 Relief Society contests, Mrs. Bailey was awarded first prize in the short story and second prize in poetry. This is her first appearance as winner of the first prize in the Eliza R. Snow Poem Contest. Vy tf @ Julia Mecham Nelson was born in Taber, Alberta, Canada. She married George A. Nelson and now lives on a ranch near Mountain View, Alberta. They have three daughters and two sons, the oldest is twelve years old and the youngest three and a half. Mrs. Nelson has contributed stories and poems to the Church magazines and has been represented in The Relief Society Magazine by several poems. This is her first appearance as a winner in the Eliza R. Snow Poem Contest. Mrs. Nelson has always had a strong urge to write, she tells us. "I taught myself touch typing at home, about two months before my fourth child was born. I have often tried to give up writing, but I can't." Over a period of twenty-five years, Mrs. Nelson has served in all the auxiliary organizations of the Church. In October 1950 she was appointed president of the Mountain View Ward Relief Society. G@ Bf 8 #8 Ruth Horsley Chadwick was born in Brigham City, Utah, the daughter of May Mathias Horsley, and the late Ermest P. Horsley. She graduated from Box Elder High School and studied at the University of Utah and the Utah Agricultural College, graduating from the latter with a teaching major in English. Marriage cut short her teaching career after one year at Logan High School. She is the wife of LeRoi C. Chadwick. They have three children. Mrs. Chadwick is an active member of the League of Utah Writers, the Utah Poetry Society, and the National League of American Pen Women, of which she is now Utah State President. In January 1944, Mrs. Chadwick was called to the Brite general board, and soon after was appointed a member of the editorial staff of The Children's Friend. In that capacity, she spends most of her time editing and writing. Page 14 Award Winners Annual Relief Sastry Short Story Contest HE Relief Society general board is pleased to announce the award winners in the short story contest which was announced in the June 1950 issue of the Magazine, and which closed September 15, 1950. The first prize of fifty dollars is awarded to Mirla Greenwood Thayne, Provo, Utah, for her story "But Covet Earnestly." The second prize of forty dollars is awarded to Inez Bagnell of Kamas, Utah, for her story "We'll Always Remember." The third prize of thirty dollars is awarded to Frances Carter Yost, Bancroft, Idaho, for her story "She Shall Have Music." All three winners in this year's short story contest are busy mothers and homemakers. This contest, first conducted by the Relief Society general board in 1941, as a feature of the Relief Society centennial observance, was made an annual contest in 1942. The contest is open only to Latterday Saint women who have had at least one literary composition published or accepted for publication by a periodical of recognized merit. The three prize-winning stories will be published consecutively in the first three issues of the Magazine for 1951. Thirty eight manuscripts were submitted in the contest for 1950, as compared with twenty-four for last year. All three of the women receiving awards this year are making their first appearance as winners in the Relief Society Short Story Contest, although each of them has previously contributed to the Magazine. Most of the stories entered in this contest were well-written, many of them revealing professional quality in organization and _technique, The contest was initiated to encourage Latter-day Saint women to express themselves in the field of fiction. The general board feels that the response to this Opportunity will continue to increase the literary quality of The Relief Society Magazine, and will aid the women of the Church in the development of their gifts in creative writing. The Relief Society Magazine has subscribers in every state of the Union, and in many foreign countries, thus providing a varied and interested group of readers. Writers, recognizing this large and appreciative audience, realize the importance of entering in the contest their very best work. The general board congratulates the prize-winning contestants, and expresses appreciation to all those who submitted stories. Sincere gratitude is extended to the three judges for their discernment and skill in selecting the prize-winning stories. 'The general board also acknowledges, with appreciation, the work of the short story committee in supervising the contest. Page 15 Prize -Winning Story Annual Relief Society Short Story Contest First Prize Story "But Covet Earnestly" Mirla Greenwood Thayne MIRLA GREENWOOD THAYNE ONDAY dawned blue for Marcia, blue as_ indigo, though the sky was cloudless, and the sun rose triumphantly over the rain-drenched hills. Marcia had said that Monday need never be blue. Synonymous with the first day of creation, each Monday to Marcia meant a new beginning. She invariably arose early and by the time old Sol made his singular appearance her washing was usually well underway. She rather liked the clean smell of suds against duds, Page 16 and the rhythmic swish of the swirling dolly often set her to singing. This morning there was no sun in Marcia's heart. Her throat was too tight for singing. She worked mechanically, her lips drawn into a thin line., '"Whatsa' matter, Mommy?" Young Stephen followed her from the kitchen to the screen porch, his brown eyes registering concern. "Is you tired, Mommy?" "Yes Stephen, a little tired," Marcia answered petulantly. She brushed a damp hand across her eyes and turned her head quickly to hide the signs of a deluge that she knew were beginning to appear. "Run in the front room, Stephie, pick up the Sunday paper for Mother, hustle now!" She gathered up a basket of clothes and hurried to the line. Other Mondays Stephen had followed her there. They had chatted joyously together, about the flowers, the tiny red-winged humming birds that nested in Marcia's Dianthus. Stephen had handed her the pins while her deft fingers secured a panorama of clothes to the line. This morning she could not bear his questioning, so she was relieved to hear the story hour coming over the morning broadcast. Stephen would be lost in fairyland for a while.. "BUT COVET EARNESTLY" Not many Mondays ago she had found joy in so many little things; the cool grass beneath her sandled feet; the flowers that were yielding to her own nurturing; neatly folded linens that seemed to retain their share of the subtle sachet of growing things. 'Then, at the close of day, there was the satisfaction of work well done and, as she relaxed her strength to the coolness of fresh sheets, she imagined she realized, in part, how God must have felt when he viewed his labor of the first day and saw that it was good. But something had happened to Marcia lately. 'The children annoyed her. 'The little house smothered her. Stephen was right, she was tired; tired of crowding a million thankless tasks into a single day. She was tired of the endless molehills that kept her from scanning the mountains of her dreams. Lately her thoughts had been taking detours into the past. "Things could have been different for you, Marcia," her conscience chided. "You were not meant to wear the shoes of a Biblical Martha. If you had married Brad Stanley, things would have been quite different." True, Doc Stanley had appreciated her abilities. He still did. Last week she had met him quite by chance. He had seemed pleased to see her. "Are you still writing, Marcia?" he had inquired. Marcia's negative answer had brought exclamations of regret. "Marcia," he had said, "you are not being true to yourself. Your talent is you, Marcia." V/ OW, as she folded soft towels, Marcia remembered that somewhere in the scriptures a penalty was prescribed for procrastination such as hers. She couldn't recall just what it was. Perhaps she should have followed Miss Holten's advice and considered her career first. "Marcia, you have an unusual talent," Miss Holten had said. "Keep writing. The time will come when you will enjoy real success," and the elderly teacher had returned the manuscript that she had just finished reading to the English class. Marcia had often noticed a look of loneliness foreshadowing the face of the gray-haired teacher. "T shall keep writing," Marcia had told herself, "but please God let me live first." "THE next time they met Marcia showed Miss Holten a small diamond on her engagement finger. "T'm disappointed in you, Marcia,' Miss Holten had said. ""What about your talent?" "Oh, but I shall write, too," Marcia had 'said, and she was sure then that she spoke the truth. It had all seemed so right then. She and Jim had little in the way of worldly possessions, but they had young strength and the faith of the untried. 'They had bought the little house on Lake Street, not because it suited their needs, but because it was within their means. - "It's small now, Honey, but we'll make it grow with us," Jim had said. However, the little house had grown only smaller as its contents increased. 18 Each baby contributed its share of happiness. Marcia had loved the little tasks of preparation, tiny embroidery on soft flaxen garments, _ the poignantly clean smell of cedar from the little chest Jim had made especially for her baby things; the morning ritual of bathing her babies, their tiny bodies warm against her own. 'This was real creation. Marcia had been happy then, and at times so full of the sweetness of living that she would find release for her emotions through the written word, and when time refused to allow for their completion, the unfinished manuscripts found their way into a little drawer in the old mahogany desk. This little drawer, with its disheveled heap of papers, was partly responsible for Marcia's present frustration. She had labeled it "Tomorrow," and its deserted contents waited on for a tomorrow that just didn't come. Lately it had tugged at Marcia and appeared as forlorn as a neglected child. Yesterday's experiences had added another unfinished poem to the little drawer. It had also added fuel to the fire of Marcia's discontent. Jim had come in from Sunday School, followed by Stephen and Brent. "Want to go fora ride, Momsey?"' Jim had inquired. "There's something on East Drive that you must see!" So they had all clambered into the little car, with Jim in the drivers seat, Stephen perched on his knee, ready to match maniature man hands with his father's at the wheel. The road stretched before them like a silver ribbon. Newly budded RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1951 trees wove variegated green lace against the sky. IM swerved the car eastward and brought it to a sudden stop. There it was! Iris on tall stems, a field of them, orchid, yellow, royal purple, a fusion of many colors, all washed by rain! "Flowers!" cried Stephen, clapping chubby brown hands. "Flowers, Mommy, more'n forty of 'em." Marcia was silent. Carelessly spoken words could not justly describe this sudden beauty. They are like real orchids, bathed in rainbow mist, she thought. April was being temperamental. She banished clouds enough to make way for a sudden shaft of sunlight. A rainbow arched across the sky. | 'i radiant trellis, an ethereal line, Marcia visioned. No wonder the makers of myths called the rainbow their roadway to Valhalla. Her mediation was interrupted by the approach of Eric, the tall, lean keeper of the Lawn Dell Iris Farm. "You like flowers?" he asked Marcia. "They are beautiful," sponded almost reverently. Proudly Eric pointed out his most prized species, while Stephen _listened in wide-eyed wonder. "I crossed this White Goddess with the Golden Eagle variety," Eric said, handing a hybrid bloom to Marcia. "See the bright yellow of the father plant blended with the delicacy of the mother." He plucked another iris. "This orchid bloom resulted from crossing the Great Lakes species with the Angeles pink." she re- "BUT COVET EARNESTLY" "Mommy," Stephen broke in, "do flowers have mommies and daddies, too?" "Yes, Stephen, all living things have fathers and mothers." Stephen's wide eyes searched the garden as if he expected the lithe flowers to adopt human forms. "Come here, Sonny." 'The gentle caretaker had drawn Stephen to his side and, taking stamen and pollen from the delicate blooms, he explained to the curious child the miracle of the flowers. On the way home Marcia tremained silent, trying to hold fast to the words that had come to her in the garden. 'The loss of a single simile would be abortive to this conception of beauty that was hers. Back in the confines of her own little room, she wrote swiftly, confidently. Here was one word picture that would not go into the drawer unfinished—she hoped. * Ke OK "oM hungry, Mom," young Brent boomed into the _ kitchen. "When do we eat?" Marcia's throat tightened. She tried not to hear. "I'm hungry, Mommy," Stephen echoed. "When do we eat?" Marcia walked into the kitchen. She might as well care for their needs now. "You don't know what hunger is,' she told them, trying to keep the bitterness out of her voice. Didn't the male of the species ever consider anything but his stomach? "But, Mommy, a man gets hungry often and we ate 'bout forty hours ago." Forty had been Stephen's pet number ever since Marcia had told him the story of Ali Baba. 19 "Of course you are hungry, Son." Marcia looked at the clock. 'True, Stephen had exaggerated, but it was past supper time. Their hunger appeased, the children went back to their play. Marcia resumed her writing. "'Where's Mother?" She was suddenly brought to reality by Connie's tremulously young voice. Marcia's frustration mounted. The door opened gently. "Hi, Mother! Busy? I have a problem. Let's just talk for a few minutes, Momsey?" Connie sat on the edge of the desk, her slim legs dangling. "Shall I ask Ken to go to Cynthia's party with me tomorrow night? Jean is going to take Hal. What do you think of Ken, Mother?" Connie talked on and on. Marcia anchored her attention to the problem of the hour and counseled her daughter lovingly. "You are sweet, Moms," Connie said, as she planted a breathlessly soft kiss on Marcia's cheek and flitted from the room on_ butterfly wings. Just fourteen, thought Marcia, a living poem of fourteen years, but surely not a sonnet, just a sweet simple lyric. The old-fashioned clock struck seven. Where had the day gone? Time seemed to deliberately evade her. "Time for church!" Jim's big voice boomed through the little house. "Come on, Kids, let's get ready." Marcia heard the back door slam, and she knew that Brent had answered the summons. She heard Stephen calling for the towel. "Ready, Mother?" Jim queried. 20 Marcia stepped to the door. "I believe I won't go tonight, Jim," she said, hesitantly, knowing full well the outcome of such a suggestion. "I 'don't want to go tonight, either," said Brent, and Stephen made a beeline for the kack door to resume his play. "Oh, let's all go," Marcia had said, as she gathered her little brood around her. "Church is our place on Sunday night." KK OK OK OK HEN, after church, Bishop Callister approached Marcia and asked her to accept the position of president of the Relief Society, she felt that she had reached the acme of her defeat., Her first impulse was to say no. "I am sure the Lord will bless you, Marcia," the Bishop. Said. "He'll make you equal to this calling." Marcia wanted to tell the bishop that he was asking too much, that she had other plans, but all she could do was to answer simply, "PI let you know. I must think it over." And she had thought it over, and over, and over, while walking home, while reading Stephen his bedtime story and when, after hours of thinking, she finally gave herself up to Morpheus, it was to restless dreaming of long hours of welfare work, of planning and organizing, of visits to the sick. A far-flung deviation from iris and rainbow mist, she thought. * KOK OK Y bedtime Monday, Marcia had made up her mind. Her answer was going to be an emphatic "No." RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1951 There were others who could devote their time to the Church. From now on she was going to be unselfish to herself alone, while she pursued her ambitions. She would begin this minute. She drew the little drawer from its place and set it on the front room floor. Seating herself beside it, she began exploring its contents. There was a feeble knock at the door. Marcia looked up, to see the pallid features of her neighbor Nedra Cowan. Oh, no, Marcia said to herself, not her again. She was in no mood to hear her distraught neighbor tonight. Night after night she had listened to the same agonizing story. She had wanted to help, but Nedra had refused to be comforted. Marcia opened the door. Nedra was twisting nervously at the print apron that hung from her waist. "Tm glad you're home, Marcia." Nedra's swollen eyes searched Marcia's pleadingly. "I must talk to someone. Oh, Marcia, what can I do?" The words ended in a sob. "Nedra, Nedra, get hold of yourself." Marcia put her arm around her troubled neighbor. "Marcia," Nedra sobbed, "will you walk with me? I can't sleep. All night I think of Bob. He was alone, Marcia. He died all alone out there. He needed me, and I was not with him. He had so much faith, too, Marcia. Before he left he said to me, "Mother, keep praying that I shall never be forced to kill". He was all that I had, Marcia. Why did God take him from me? How could he, if—if there is a God?" Heartbreak, fear, and disillusionment combined in agonized weeping. "BUT COVET EARNESTLY" "Nedra, oh, Nedra," was all that Marcia could say. Of what use were words and the gift to use them if they failed you at a time like this? Nedra continued, "When he came home from the last war I thanked God every day of my life. I had given one son to the cause, but I still felt that God was good. He had. Given back one of my boys. Then they took him again, and I kept saying, 'He'll come back. God will take care of him. He did before. He will again.' But now he's gone and something has happened to me. I can't pray anymore, Marcia. I can't be sure that God lives. Oh, Marcia!" Marcia's arm tightened around her neighbor. She wanted so much to give Nedra of her strength. The two women walked along the moonlit path. 'The air was still; silver shafts of light interspersed the shadows of the lilac trees that bordered the walk. Nedra's sobs continued. Marcia prayed secretly again. She must do something to relieve this burdened soul. "Please, God, give me words," she prayed. From somewhere out of the still night, words came to Marcia. "Nedra, dear, death is not dreadful. People have seen beyond the veil and they all say that if we knew the sweetness of death we wouldn't care to live. I wish you had been to church last night. Brother Clayton gave a wonderful talk. He said that God has promised us that the righteous of our loved ones who die, die in Christ and do not really taste of death, but death will be sweet to them. From the Book of Mormon he read a promise that God gave to those who die for their country. 'The promise is that they shall find 21 happiness in death. From Alma he read that God allows the righteous to be killed to bring judgment upon the wicked. God says we needn't suppose that the righteous are lost when they die in the war, because they go to their Father in heaven. Nedra, I believe that angels minister to the wants of those boys whose loved ones are praying for them, just as they ministered to Nephi and to Daniel of old. Bob did not die alone, Nedra." MARCIA talked on into the night. Nedra's sobs had ceased, and a serenity seemed to prevail over the women as they walked arm in arm through the stillness. "Now is the time we all need God and his gospel, Nedra. Promise me, you will never doubt again." "Thanks, Marcia," Nedra. Said. "I promise." Marcia walked slowly back to the house. It was late. Jim and the children' were asleep. 'The little drawer was still on the floor where she had left it. She knelt down beside it and began to explore its contents, reading a line here, a verse there. Somehow, tonight, the little unfinished manuscripts seemed for the most part quite shallow and immature. She wondered how she could have imagined that they were good. She must live much, much more, if she would write. Everything that she had ever written was an outgrowth of her own experience—and for a moment she had thought to shut herself off from the main source of her inspiration. Tonight she had learned the need of a greater gift, so she prayed; not for her selfish ambitions, but for her grief-stricken neighbor, and for 22 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1951 other mothers who must walk the "way of Calvary." Only once did she pray for herself, and the words of this prayer she wrote and placed above the little desk where she could see them each day. Give me this gift, an understanding heart. Of all life's gifts—this is the master art— The power to comfort those who pass my way. Give me the strength to do—the words to say. Now Marcia was sure that she understood the words of one of Tarsus, that man of letters whose deep discriminating spirituality enabled him to always put first things first. "But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way. Though I - speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity it profiteth me nothing.... Charity never faileth." 4 2 im children. Mlirla G reenwood Shayne Mirla Greenwood Thayne, daughter of Thomas F. And Emma Greenwood, and wife of Clifton E.

She must rearrange the last bit of tinsel, and set the star aright at the top of the tree, and hang the candy canes just so along the red and green paper ropes that the children had stretched across the back of the room. The candy canes were her gift to the children. Each year she saved carefully from her salary check to buy sizable ones for every child. Being a stickler for sanitation, she re-examined the canes to make certain their cellophane wrappings were secure, and that each bore its own Christmas tag tied on with red ribbons. To Mary from Miss Brown, To Paul from Miss Brown, To Joe—Miss Brown sighed. To think of Joe was to stir in her heart the old longing to help him find status in the room with the other children. Perhaps her own love and understanding were the only way now. 'To Peter from Miss Brown, To Sharon—To Jimmy. Her blue eyes lighted with laughter as she thought of Jimmy Mack's grimy hands which would have the cellophane peeled and gone in no time, and the bright red and white stripes of the candy cane interspersed with smudgy stripes of his own making. Phyllis Lawn, who sat next to him, would look with immaculate disdain upon his greed, but Jimmy would be happy with the elaborate unconcern of most third grade boys. Miss Brown sat for a moment upon the edge of the sandbox and permitted herself the luxury of slumping. It might ease the ache between her shoulder blades. She pushed her hands up through her smooth brown hair, removed and replaced her side combs, sighing a little as she contemplated the bustling tomorrow ahead. Getting ready for the holidays of a school year was one of the fun things in a school teacher's life, and one of the hard things, too. You barely had the Halloween goblins behind your back, when Thanksgiving was there in the hall, and the children were brimming with ideas for painting turkeys and filling cornucopias with the colorful harvest from their own autumn gardens. 'The turkeys had only just had time to follow the Pilgrims down from the borders and bulletin boards, when holly and mistletoe and gay Christmas bells trooped in for their place. Billy Jenkins had announced on November thirtieth that he and his daddy would bring the class their Christmas tree this year. On December first it was there, with wide green boughs outstretched like benevolent arms. 'The children beamed and screeched in delight when they came next morning to be greeted by the woodsy odor of the pine. They began at once to think of the proper ornament for each twig, and what to put at the top, and what to wrap around the base. They wanted to make their own Christmas chains for it. And for weeks the room had shimmered with red and green circles linked together in long, pasted chains. Page 23 24 And teacher's desk was piled high with pictures of the Christ Child, and of Santa Claus, and reindeer on the rooftops, always. Rooftops with the high, imaginative chimneys a young child draws with his own free abandon. Thinking of the chains brought another smile to Miss Brown's face —the day she looked up from hearing group two read, and saw Susan Beeley, a small elflike child taut with anger and humiliation, standing over Peter Fromm, the biggest boy in the room. Susan had just slapped him hard on the cheek. Peter stared at her with guilt and surprise and a bright pink spot written on his face. "T couldn't help it, Miss Brown. I just couldn't help it. He broke my paper chain and I'd worked so hard on it," cried Susan. The whole class could see the bright evidence of Peter's crime still dangling from his clenched fist. He looked down at his seatwork a moment and then suddenly he was saying, and with true repentance, "I'm sorry, Susan, I'll give you my paper, the red and the green both. Here." And he pushed his own share of the colored squares not yet cut toward Susan, who sat down and grimly began again. "THERE are priceless gems along the way of a teacher's day, Miss Brown thought, as she turned from the sandbox to watch the sun sink into the lavender of winter twilight. For eleven years she had taught in this same room. It had become a part of her. She loved the wide west windows that looked across weaving fields into the flaming winter sunsets. She loved the RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1951 warped window sills, with their rows of potted plants in fluted crepe-paper coverings, and the long blackboards with erasers and chalk neatly spaced along the troughs, and the gay and newsy bulletin board. 'There was a rough place on the east blackboard so she kept it covered with the monthly calendar, designed and painted by the children. Thinking of the calendar brought her mind back to Joe Grandon. It had been his turn to design the December calendar. Miss Brown had purposely seen to that. Her face clouded now as she thought on the ways of saving Joe from the scathing jibes of the other children. How is it, she found herself wondering, that children are so loving and so cruel? It would be part of their long growingup to learn to drop this cruelty in favor of kindness and understanding. She had ttied first to block the taunts meant for Joe by approaching Peter and Billy, who most frequently headed the "peer group" in the room. They were housekeepers during an early week in September, and, while they were vigorously dusting the books and banging them into their places on the corner book shelves, she had spoken matter-of-factly. "T couldn't help noticing," she said, "that Joe wasn't playing in the ball game at recess time this morning." "Um-mm," muttered Billy. But, Peter, being the open one, immediately blurted out, "Nope, he's part Injun. Besides he don't know how to play ball." Miss Brown flushed with quick anger, but minded her words, "No A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR TEACHER one knows how if he doesn't get a chance to play." The boys had moved over to the windows now and were busy pouring water in the plant pots along the sill. Bully set his watering can down and observed casually, "He might could play with Jake." Jake was the only full-blood Indian boy in the room. "Yeah," agreed Peter readily, "they'd make a good team—good idea." Miss Brown saw there was work to be done, and she began by finding ways to interest the class in the Pahute legends of Jake's people. Thanksgiving Day had been a good time to use Jake in a program depicting the Pilgrim's first feast day. He wore the native dress of his people and shyly repeated a chant that old Minnie, his grandmother, had taught him. But Joe's was a different problem. She had called at his home and found his parents helpful and willing, despite their poverty. The dark eyes of the mother, looking out upon the world with patience and without complaint, told her there would always be an ally in the home for Joe. Dear, quiet Joe, with his own great dark eyes looking up from the desk in the middle of row four. He would push his grubby little hands through his hair as he struggled to understand the words in his reader, and look up with pleading in his gentle face each time he realized he couldn't say the word. And, if he got it right, he would look up again with enchanted anticipation for the friendly word he 25 knew she'd say. "'That's good, Joe. You keep trying and I'll be back to help." And his face reflected a glowing light rippling from childish curved lips to the roots of his hair, as she smilingly passed onto the next pupil, her heart falling as she sensed how much he needed her to stay. But there were forty others in the room, each with a different need. Shy and fearful to the point of muteness, Joe would shrink back into himself, darting frightened side glances across the aisle, expecting disapproval, but hoping always for acceptance. The day came for him to choose his helper for the Christmas calendar. Humbly he glanced at Peter, strong and tall, and full of confdence—but he dared not ask Peter. His eyes fell upon Billy. Maybe Billy would work with him. Miss Brown was ready to offer protection if Billy said no—but he said, "Sure." And again there was the momentary light of pure joy rippling up in Joe's face, for he was now one of the class. The next morning Joe had brought many things to choose from, worked out with the help of his mother the night before. Mrs. Grandon was an artist in many ways, and Joe came bearing a lovely figure of the Christ Child in his mother's arms, and many shepherds to kneel outside the stable which he and Billy would draw, and a glorious shining star that his mother had helped him make from scraps of tinfoil. It was all for the precious calendar. And he brought it with happiness on his countenance, and a feeling of belongingness singing in his heart. Billy, 26 falling in with the spirit of Joe, worked hard, measuring and drawing and helping to mount the lovely Christmas figures. Miss Brown turned back to the room and noticed how the last rays of the sun lingered on the star. It gave her an idea. She would make a halo for the Christ Child's head, and one for the Mother Mary, too. It would please Joe tomorrow when he saw what she had done. * ke e & HE children came in at one o'clock, all eager with anticipation. The girls wore their best dresses, and the boys had clean shirts and slicked-up hair. 'They were going to sing together in the hall—all the grades together, before they distributed their class gifts. Miss Brown struck a chord on the piano, and they began rehearsing. It lifts the heart to hear them, she thought, and pondered over the grace that little children find under the guardian eyes of heaven at Christmas time. The bell rang to call the school to assembly in the hall. Solemnly the children took their places before the towering Christmas tree, which bedecked the front entrance. The smaller children settled first and turned to watch the upper grades come down the steps and rustle into their places on the long stairs flanking each end of the hall. Three boys from the sixth grade stood at the top of the stairs and lifted their trumpets to play the strains of "Deck the Halls," which was the signal to come to order for the caroling. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1951 Miss Smith, the music teacher, raised her hand to give the second signal, and the young voices rose in high, silvery tones, the pure cadence of their blithe songs swelling, advancing, receding into the unchecked joy of the Christmas spirit. "Up on the Housetop," they sang—and "Jolly Old Saint Nicholas," and then the tender songs, "O, Little Town of Bethlehem," "It Came Upon the Midnight Clear," "Luther's Cradle Hymn," and "Far, Far Away on Judea's Plains." 'Then, finishing with the loving words of Longfellow's benediction, "I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day," they turned back to their rooms softly singing the last verse: Till ringing, singing on its way The world revolved from night to day, A voice, a chime, a chant sublime, Of peace on earth, good will toward men. They had behaved like angels all during the singing, and now Miss Brown smiled upon them at their neat desks, sitting in stiff and unaccustomed politeness under the magic of their own goodness. Christmas was good for them— very good. The giving and the singing together, and now the waiting for what came from the Christmas tree. Some of the boys were self-consciously nudging each other and smirking a little. The girls, with hands neatly folded on top of their desks, looked upon these disturbers of the spirit with adult sternness in their dark glances and pursed mouths. Miss Brown looked down at Joe, who sat proud and still, glancing now at the bespangled tree and now at his beloved calendar. John A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR TEACHER and Mary Beth were to be messengers to carry the gifts which each child had brought for the namedrawing in the room. Miss Brown began taking the gaily-wrapped parcels down from the tree, and a gradual murmur of pleasure broke into gleeful outbursts as the children unwrapped gay and funny things and shared them with their classmates. She passed the cookies and apples donated by the mothers, and the children were soon gathering their possessions together ready for the long winter holiday. ACK at her desk, she looked down upon a stack of beribboned gifts meant for herself. 'Their gifts always embarrassed Miss Brown. She loved them, but she felt so sorry about the youngsters who could not bring something for teacher. The deepest wish she could have was to make each child feel his own excellence and worth in his world. They were filing out of the room now. "Goodbye, Miss Brown. Merry Christmas, Miss Brown. See you after holidays. Goodbye." The room was filling with quiet after the festivities. A few stragglers were still fumbling with their wraps and galoshes in the hall. Miss Brown sat down at her desk and stared at the packages for herself. She knew there would be many handkerchiefs, which she always loved, and some sweet-smelling soap from Phyllis and Jean—they had told her ahead of time—and some bath salts from Virginia. All of it was too much to give, but she appreciated the thoughts behind the 27 giving. And she must get busy now for there was much to be done before she took the night bus home. Light footsteps caught her attention. Joe was crossing the room. His great velvet eyes were fastened upon her face, and his breath came in quick little gasps as he marched steadily toward her. "Miss Brown—Miss Brown," he said coming up to the desk, "here is something for you. I brought this—for you." And he thrust out his tightly closed fist and opened it to display two shining copper pennies—warm from the sweat of his hand. He turned them over and laid them on her desk. "Why, Joe." She looked into his proud young face. "Thank you —thank you very much for thinking of me, Joe." And she moved the pennies over with the rest of the gifts. Joe still lingered. His eyes were still fastened upon hers and he swallowed quickly against the revelation of some other pentup excitement. Miss Brown knew the strange wonder of the grownup before the guileless innocence of the child. "Are you going to have a happy Christmas at your house, Joe?" He nodded. "The best one. My mother says it's the very best one. Look..." and again he was thrusting something toward her. A crumpled slip of paper. A grocery list from the corner store. "The strike's off at the mines and my daddy bought all this list of groceries last night with money. He didn't have to charge a thing. He paid for all of these. My mother says it'll be the best Christmas we've ever had."

What precious fruit have we garnered for the soul's heritage? What evil have we overcome in our own erring natures, and what sacrifices have we made of self? If we have not been seeking wisdom from the living fountain of knowledge, it is a good time now to commence. The year is slipping fast away, soon the New Year will be upon us. It is an eve of sadness and yet of joy; there are many pleasant realisms, which fill the lap of life with blessings; and if there are some sorrows, some regrets, some human pain, let us acknowledge God in all things, and trustful in His providence, look into the bright new year with hopeful glance, never doubting His kind care and protection. Let it be one of the fresh, green places in our lives towards which, in after years, we may turn with a sense of infinite restfulness, a refuge of peace in moments of pain——Aunt Em. MEMORIA If only in my dreams I may behold thee, Still hath the day a goal; If only in my dreams I may enfold thee, Still hath the night a soul. Ten thousand blossoms earth's gay gardens cherish; One pale, pale rose is mine; Of frost or blight the rest may quickly perish, Not so that rose divine. —Florence Earle Coates HOME THOUGHTS: To make home a delightsome and an attractive place, does not depend upon a large, fine house, with plenty of costly furniture, and expensive surroundings, although these are very pleasing and attractive to the eye; but the true secrets and attributes of a happy home are not purchased with gold or silver, but are placed there by the hearts and the united efforts of the inmates of that dwelling. What are riches compared with the love of sincere and honest hearts? It does not matter if the floor is bare, the rooms limited and the furniture unpainted, the home may be far more pleasant and enjoyable than the finest mansion that is without the peace and quietude of loving hearts. In a home where the Spirit of the Lord is an inmate, the husband and wife are each striving for the welfare of the other, and unitedly striving for the welfare of their children—M. E. H. DAVIS STAKE RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE: Bro. Wm. Muir, being called upon said, I feel to add my mite to your Conference, it really does me good to look at these aged sisters, I think they are the ones who stand at the helm—they are the ones who have rocked the cradle, and their course has been onward, and the Latterday Saints do not stop progressing. It is what we do we get credit for, and not what we leave undone. Pres. Z. D. H. Young then addressed the meeting.... My heart aches for those who do not come to meeting, for we need the bread of life for our spirits. By and by, when pay day comes, those who do not attend to their duties will want just as much as those who do, but they will fall short—Phebe C. Sessions, Secretary Page 28 RS. BELLE S. SPAFFORD, general president of Relief Society, has been re-elected third vice-president of the National Council of Women in the United States. Mrs. Spafford conducted two of the general sessions of the National Council convention held in New York City in October 1950, and presented the annual report of Relief Society. Mrs. Florence Jepperson Madsen, a member of the general board of Relief Society, accompanied Mrs. Spafford to New York City and presented the annual report of the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association. 'The members of the National Council were greatly interested in the outstanding activities of these two auxiliaries of the Church. "TON CARLO," the first performance of the Metropolitan Opera's 1950-51 season, heard over the air, was staged by Margaret Webster, a famous figure in the theater of both Great Britain and America. Miss Webster has _ revived many classical plays, one notable example being The Trojan Women, which she directed and in which she played the leading role. Included in the cast was Miss Webster's mother, the famous Dame May Whitty. Miss Webster has also directed her mother very successfully in plays in New York. Woman's Sphere Ramona W. Cannon Dame May, beloved in Britain and America, and a very popular actress in our moving pictures, died in 1948. Ys E COWL, playwright and actress, noted for several Shakespearean roles on the American stage, died last June. UTH MAY FOX, former president of the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association, celebrated her ninety-seventh birthday on November 16, 1950. Among other accomplishments, she walked about after having been invalided for several months by a fractured hip. Though her eyesight has failed considerably, she still writes poetry and memorizes entire chapters of scripture. CLARA BRYANT FORD, eightythree, widow of Henry Ford, died in September 1950. She kept up his hopes and his spirits during the difficult years of experimenting with the "mechanical buggy." He often called her "the believer." RS. CHARLES B.. KNOX, ninety-two, died in September 1950. When her husband, the gelatine manufacturer, died in 1908, she took over the tiny factory and made it into a model business. Her explanation of her success was: "T just used common sense." Page 29 CQ EDITORIAL o~9 VOL. 38 JANUARY 1951 She Old and the New Blessed of the Lord be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew and for the deep.. And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun... And for the chief things of 'the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the laste hills... (Deuteronomy 33:13-15). N this time of the year's beginning, we look toward the new days with a desire to enrich our lives and the lives of our associates. We wish to use our limited time with prudence and with rejoicing. Moments of evaluation come to us, when we seek to find "the chief things" of the earth. Again we ask ourselves if we have found steadfast wisdom and guidance for our lives. Many people are perplexed regarding the seeming conflict between the old and the new, between that which is traditional and that which seems to be newly discovered. There are those who say that because an idea or a possession is old it should be discarded, and all new thoughts and new things should be accepted without question because they are new. There is no depth of thought beneath this surface generalization. Shall we throw away something beautiful because it has been in the family a long time? Shall we refuse to listen to the wisdom that has been tested through the ages? Shall we say that faith in God is superstition because it has long lived in the hearts of men? To do so would be to deny the testing power of time. It would be to say that the efforts of the good and the great have been in vain, that the work of their hands Page 30 and the majesty of their words have passed away. 'To forget the longcherished ideal of life would be to deny that there is an eternal plan, unchanging and unchangeable, in its law and order, by which all men are bound. Everywhere the old and the new are inseparable. 'The young mother who first looks into the face of her child, and the elderly woman who looks with faith upon her return to the spirit world are both a part of eternal life. The clean snows of January cover the old leaves and the stubble fields of many seasons, and the green leaf of April springs from a dark and seemingly barren bough. Think of walking on the turf of pine needles in the forest—how deep with years —and yet looking up and seeing the fresh green plume shining on the end of the bough. Everywhere the old and the permanent, the enduring things of earth, are linked inseparably with renewal, and with the spirit of morning. The old and the new are one. They are the cycles of eternity, and that which we call change is but the turning of a wheel bringing us to a time when our -troubles and _perplexities shall be made plain, "for now we see through a glass, darkly; but then -face to face." Even the EDITORIAL new discoveries in science are but the application of laws and forces that have existed before the world was formed. Many of the so-called new social theories, some of them already found wanting, many of them misguided and unprogressive, are but an attempt to find a way that men may deal justly with each other. 'That way has long been found. It was set forth on the enduring tablets of stone. It is not a new pattern which we need, but a new devotion to an ancient plan. When Jesus stood upon a mountain in the Holy Land, his words fell upon the multitudes as a new light, as a great illumination, but he spoke the truth of the ages—even that gospel which was established 31 in the spirit world. When the young boy, Joseph Smith, prayed in the grove of tall trees, an olden truth was restored to him, and he saw it with the wonder and the glory of youth. It was given to a great poet to ask: "Why wander round... Why wander vainly round? What canst thou find with seeking, which hath not long been found?" It is the cry of many "Oh, that I might believe, for then I should be strengthened. I would not be alone." Those who recognize in their own lives and in the world the operation of divine and eternal law, find a stability and a serenity unknown to those who seek, unguided, for that which is new. Wep c. 4 Gow Tlew Serial to Begin in Sebruary The first chapter of "For the Strength of the Hills," a new serial by Mabel S. Harmer, will begin in the February issue of the Magazine. The story relates the problems which confront a young schoolteacher who leaves her California home to live in an Idaho ranching community. Mrs. Harmer, an experienced and widely published author, writes with ease and distinction, and presents her characters realistically and with sympathy. 'The close relationship between people and their home environment is well presented, and Camilla Fenton, who tries to change her home and her surroundings, is a girl you will like to meet. <_< 'Rosemary Margery S. Stewart In my mother's window there were Green things growing, Violets, begonias, and ivy Of her sowing. It was as if in winter months She fought against the dearth Of dipping yellow butterflies And warmly prescient earth. And I have seen her eyes grow dark In wonder and delight To find the frail Narcissi Had blossomed in the night. Now, though our roads be far apart, I know her presence still, In windows where the summer blooms All winter on a sill.

Page 32 NOTES TO THE FIELD. 33 Relicf Society lot a Selling Agent All Relief Society presidents are requested by the general board to note the following counsel which was given by President Belle S. Spafford in her "Official Instructions" in the 1949 annual general Relief Society conference: We are aware that you are occasionally approached by commercial institutions or by individuals for the purpose of having you sell their product on a commission basis. Such an undertaking should be weighed carefully and the counsel of the Priesthood should be sought. Care must be exercised to make sure that Relief Society does not become a selling agent, and that people are not solicited in the name of the society to the point where the society becomes subject to criticism (The Relief Society Magazine, December 1949, page 808). Pictures of All General Presidents of Reliof Society Now Available To complete the set of pictures of the general presidents of Relief Society, prints of a photograph of President Belle S. Spafford are now available. Pictures of the other general presidents are also available: Emma Hale Smith, Eliza Roxey Snow, Zina D. H. Young, Bathsheba W. Smith, Emmeline B. Wells, Clarissa §. Williams, Louise Y. Robison, and Amy Brown Lyman. These prints, in oval form, appropriately 3% by 5% inches in size, may be ordered for 25c for the complete set, or 5c for each individual picture.

For the third consecutive year, infantile paralysis went on a rampage across the nation, striking more than 30,000 men, women, and children. Only once before—in 1949—had polio attacked with greater violence. The toll of that tragic year was still being counted as the fresh onslaught began. Hospitals and clinics were still crowded with polio patients from previous epidemics who were depending upon MARCH OF DIMES aid for continuing treatment. Polio played no favorites in ig50. Every section of the country suffered heavy attacks. The last three years have been the three blackest polio years in the nation's history. Cumulative incidence for this period reached the monstrous total of 100,000 cases—almost as many as the entire case load for the preceding ten years. Fortunately, wherever polio hit, a Chapter of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis was on the spot, ready to help the patient, his family, and the entire community, as necessary. The staggering blow of the 1950 epidemic was absorbed—the shock eased—by prompt and efficient use of MARCH OF DIMES funds. MARCH OF DIMES money paid hospital bills for thousands of families who could not meet the high cost of polio care unaided. Four out of every five of the stricken needed—and received—financial assistance from the National Foundation and its chapters. MARCH OF DIMES money paid for nursing care, physical therapy, transportation, wheel chairs, braces, and crutches wherever necessary. Help was given to all who needed it, without regard to age, race, creed, or color. MARCH OF DIMES money paid salaries, travel expenses and maintenance of more than 1,600 desperately needed nurses recruited for the National Foundation by the Red Cross for emergency service in highincidence areas in 37 states. Other personnel furnished on the same basis included more than 100 physical therapists and approximately 120 nursing consultants. MARCH OF DIMES money shipped more than $1,000,000 worth of iron lungs, hot pack machines, and other vital equipment on spot notice from seven equipment depots strategically located throughout the Nation. Up to mid-October these depots had rushed into epidemic zones 521 respirators, 299 hot pack machines, more than 200 cribs and beds, and a heavy volume of miscellaneous hospital supplies and equipment. If polio strikes again in 1951, we must be prepared to strike back. Epidemics cannot yet be prevented. We can no longer anticipate "light" polio years. More people are being stricken, more patients need care, more money is needed than ever before. Your Chapter stands ready today to serve you when polio strikes. It will continue to serve as long as you give it your wholehearted support. Please give generously to the 1951 MARCH OF DIMES. Page 37 Hal Rumel Page 38 SOLITUDE AND SILENCE —~—_ She Dying Year Beatrice K. Ekman Where storm has laid covers of white down Over roofs and gardens silently, The bright, full moon has spread spun-silver now, And snow-wrapped hills add grave austerity. Behind a passing cloud the round moon flees, And down the little street a cold wind blows, A sudden tremor shudders through the trees— Another year is drawing to a close. Some, on this last and fleeting old year night, Sit by the hearth in warmth of fireglow And hug their old and happier memories tight, Living again the days they used to know. They, who have grown more patient and more wise, Remembering other hearths and other fires, Look to the New Year with expectant eyes— Forsaking old regrets for new desires. Pioneering in the big Horn Basin ' Botilda Berthelson McBlain, HE early settlement made by Oy Latierdy Saints in the Big Horn Basin in the early 1900's was like the growth of certain plants which spread by sending out runners which reached out until they found conditions favorable and then took root—forming a new unit, and only God could see the results of the early starts. Strange that the gospel of Jesus Christ should bring my husband and me to the land of America, gathering us from the pathway of Denmark. Strange that we should meet here in America and establish ourselves in the valleys of the mountains, but stranger still; how we came to the Big Horn Basin of Wyoming. In ligo5 the Berthelson family included four living children, two had passed in death. The first steps" in community pioneering in Sanford, Colorado, were past, and we were settled in a comfortable pioneer home among relatives and friends. Why then should our eyes and fancy be caught by the headlines in the paper on that spring morning? LAND IN THE BIG HORN BASIN FOR HOMESTEADERS. TEN ACRES WOULD MAKE A LIVING FOR A FAMILY. EVERY OPPORTUNITY FOR BEAUTIFUL HOMES AND FINE LIVING. HE advertisement didn't mention that the Big Horn Basin at that time was one of the most desolate, barren-looking places ever to meet the eye, or tell of the big responsibility of bringing water to the land, only later to have fertile fields disappear in alkali that had to be drained, and the land teclaimed. 'The advertisement didn't tell that my quilts, which had been so. Carefully cleaned for my new home, would find their first use in a cow barn—cleaned for our occupancy, and that the built-in cupboard which I had planned so carefully would be forty years in the making. But nothing is done without dreams—and working to fulfill those dreams—and it was work to feed and clothe and educate a family of eight children. It meant planting a garden and carefully conserving, and then selling the surplus. It meant working together as a family and a community. Friends were friends who stood by you in sickness and in health, and joined in the work and the fun. There was the first log cabin that served for church and school and social life. 'There was the first community Thanksgiving, with the best of everything saved for the occasion. 'There was singing and reciting and dancing on the crude rough floor. 'The first Christmas was a community Christmas, and though the hills were silent and deserted, the hearts were full of the Christmas spirit, and the children were impatient for Santa to come. And the Fourth of July was really an affair, with bowers and programs and contests. S° many memories run from the one-roomed barn we borrowed for our temporary home, then two Page 39 40 rooms, and then six, and on through time to our own present home, with electricity and all its modern conveniences. The small farms now right in the center of town, and tractors, trucks, and other modern conveyances have taken the place of the horse and wagon. 'The good neighbors and their kindly deeds are not forgotten, and a few remain in the place where they started together, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1951 In our comfortable car we travel at will from place to place, scarcely remembering the long and cold ways of traveling when we first came to Penrose. I used to wish not only that the desert would bloom like a rose, but even that a few weeds would grow for the pig; and so in time all of our wishes have been granted, and we now produce enough of everything for a good living. As we look back over the ups and downs, we know but others have found new comwe were given strength and courmunities, and many have gone on. Age, for the task, and life is good. ———— SS, hetches Evelyn Fijeldsted. 'Recompense Matia McClelland Burk The silver mist around the moon Is but the shadow of a storm; The golden leaf that falls too soon, A hurried sketch of winter's form. I shall not rue my grieving If God still lets me sing, Nor count all loss a broken heart If I have wrought one perfect thing. _>- She Low Cost of Happiness Caroline Eyring Miner WE hear constantly now about the high cost of living, and it is true that food and clothes, and housing cost a great deal. Living happily, however, means much more than just keeping our bodies fed and clothed and housed, and the cost of most things that make for happiness is still surprisingly low. Free of charge are the glory of a sunrise, the magnificence of a sunset, the rising of a full moon over the mountains, the ever-changing variety of the clouds, the wonder of growth. Free for the taking are walks in the summer rain, or through the crisp newly fallen autumn leaves, or through the freshly fallen snow. It costs nothing to sit in the sunshine of a bright fall day with the heat penetrating every part of you and filling you with health and strength. Free are the confidential talks with old friends, the warm handclasp of someone who sympathizes. I don't know of any excessive cost of a glass of sparkling cold water, of a good healthy supply of fresh air, of the song of a bluebird in spring, of the babble of a mountain stream, or of the musical rustling of the wind in the pines. No matter that the cost of material living soars, the cost of happiness is still low because the best of its ingredients are free. From Commode into Buffet — Rachel K. Laurgaard Illustrations by Elizabeth Williamson S° many dining rooms these days are just not large enough to hold that most useful of pieces—the buffet. And yet there are those table linens to store, and the most convenient place for them is in the dining room. Did you ever think of converting a double commode—the old-fashioned kind with two doors and a drawer, made of walnut, with beautiful leaf and fruit carving on the handles—into a neat little depository for linens and silver? It can be done. If you are lucky enough to find a walnut, rosewood, or mahogany commode, refinish it in its natural wood finish, by all means. If it is oak, or something not so pretty, put a carefully painted finish on it. Paint or paper the interior to make Page 41 42 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1951 it fresh and clean, and fit it out with shelves. Firtex or beaver board are inexpensive shelving materials, so put in several. These shelves are perfect for storing linens neatly. Tarnish-proof flannel can be purchased at jewelry stores for lining the silverware drawer, and you will find it possible to store away in this modest little cabinet almost as much linen and silver as the larger buffet would hold. > Crocheting Keeps Her Busy and Happy M*. Alice Maw Poulter, Ogden, Utah, keeps her fingers flying'and her heart happy with her crochet hook. Hot pads, afghans, tablecloths, doilies, dresser scarfs, pillow tops, and many other items are skillfully made by her nimble fingers, and the intricate designs and beautifully even stitches are a joy to see. Mrs. Poulter, as she sometimes says, laughingly, gives herself away in crocheting. Her entries in the Arizona State Fair in 1949 were awarded the first prize. Another "happiness hobby" of Mrs. Poulter is reading. She owns a much-read copy of the Book of Mormon, an edition of 1879, with an inscription in gold letters "Miss Alice Maw." She reads on Sundays, and every night before she goes to bed she reads from the Doctrine and Covenants, the "Church Section" of The Deseret News, or some other inspirational material. At present she is reading The Life of Karl G. Maeser. Mrs. Poulter was born in Yorkshire, England, in 1859, and her third birthday came while she was aboard the ship Tapscott, enroute to the United States. The family settled in Ogden, and later moved to Plain City. Now, after a full life of work, service, and happiness, with her family grown and living in homes of their own, Mrs. Poulter refuses to give up and grow old. She makes her home with a daughter, Mrs. A. J. Knapp, of Ogden, and there she is busy and useful, bright-eyed, and contented. —Rosella F. Larkin From The Field — | Margaret C.

Sister Ivie H. Jones, President, Spanish-American Mission Relief Society, reports that the young women of this branch are assuming their share of responsibility. They have the youngest branch presidency in the mission and a very high percentage of young women members. The membership of the branch is scattered, and bus service is inadequate. To solve this problem and to give the young members the Dlessings that come from faithfully discharging this duty, the young members go out two by two and visit the active members, while the Relief Society presidency visits the inactive members and investigators. The idea originated in the branch itself and is working in a very splendid manner. The branch organization began in 1936, when Sister Julia Cervantes Duarte, a widow, with four sons and one daughter, was chosen president.

Georgia R. Livingston, President, Eastern States Mission Relief Society, submits a very interesting article by Elder James R. Dixon, describing the activities of this branch. Excerpts from his letter follow. ""Last year we did not know the meaning of the word Relief Society, but look what has happened now.' Those words sum up the initial year of Relief Society work among the Seneca Indian women on the Cattaraugus Reservation... A year of growth and development for the members, the raising of funds for a chapel, and a firm entrenching of Latter-day Saint standards, action, and ideals on the reservation. The original craft work of the Senecas—beadwork, basket and moccasin making—has been turned into useful projects.... And the Relief Society has established a flourishing Indian curio project. All through the late winter and early spring the women prepared warm, nourishing meals for the men who, each Saturday, contributed their time to cutting logs and preparing them for the wood pulp mills, as their contribution to the building fund. When land and seed were needed for a branch welfare project, members of the Relief Society donated two and one half acres of land, with sufficient lima bean and corn seed to plant the entire plot.... Red letter day of the year was the visit of Georgia R. Livingston, President of the Eastern States Mission Relief Society. The occasion was highlighted by a beautiful testimony meeting, following Sister Livingston's inspiring talk. Signal recognition came to Sister Livingston when she was adopted by the sisters into the Snipe Clan of the Seneca Nation and given the Indian name meaning 'White Flower' " >_< lirror, Mirror Mabel Jones Gabbott I need no mirror on the wall To tell me I must mend my ways; My daughter, playing with her doll, Reflects each manner, tone, and phrase. LESSON Sheology—The Life and Ministry of the Savior Lesson 31—"The Long Night of Apostasy" Elder Don B. Colton (Reference: Jesus the Christ, by Elder James E. Talmage, chapter 40.) For Tuesday, April 3, 1951 Objective: To prove that there was an apostasy from the Primitive Church and that the Lord Jesus ceased to reveal himself to men for centuries. T is doubtful if there are any Christian churches that claim there was direct revelation from God after the apostles were taken from the earth until the year 1820. In fact, most of these churches insist that no new revelation has yet come. Indeed, they say it is not necessary; that the Bible is a sufficient guide. This position is taken in the face of the plain declaration of the Bible: "Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets" (Amos 3:7). "The passing of the apostles was followed by the rapid development of a universal apostasy as had been foreseen and predicted." Both external and internal causes were back of this apostasy. 'The Church, from the beginning, met with opposition from both Jews and pagans. The severe and cruel persecution caused many to desert the cause. This was true of many of the officers holding positions of responsibility in the Church. 'There were some whose zeal was stimulated, but many more could not endure and Page 50 fell away. The worst cause, however, was the internal dissension, division, and turning from the truth, all of which resulted in a complete apostasy. It has already been shown how bitter most of the Jews were and how relentlessly and cruelly they persecuted the members of the Church. The Romans soon joined in vigorous hostilities. 'These persecutions were general during Nero's reign and extended from about 64 A. D. Until about 305 A. D., with only occasional respites. History records the cruel, inhuman, and barbarous atrocities of that period. We do not have space for details. Early in the fourth century, Constantine the Great became emperor. He made a complete change. He soon made Christianity the state religion within his empire. The church of that day, however, had been almost completely changed and bore little resemblance to the Church founded by the Savior and named for him. There was only a crude outline of the original organization. 'The emperor had not been LESSON DEPARTMENT baptized, but he made himself the head of the church. Paul said: "And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron" (Heb. 5:4). Church offices were more widely sought than either military or political positions. The bishop of Rome, without direct revelation, claimed supremacy over the other officers of the church, but when Constantine made Constantinople his capital, the bishop there claimed equal authority with the one at Rome. 'The dispute divided the church, a division which has continued to this day. As a result, we have the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches, both of which have been in existence since the fourth century, each claiming to be the church of God. The bishop of Rome assumed secular as well as spiritual powers, and in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, his authority was superior to kings and emperors. The spiritual powers claimed were even more audacious than the temporal powers. He pretended to forgive sins and remit penalties here and hereafter. He even sold the right to commit future sins in this life and extended forgiveness on earth and in heaven. Read Paul's prophecy of the powers that would be usurped (2 Thess. 2:3-4). (Isaiah 24:5) prophecied that the earth itself would be "defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant," which is the gospel of Jesus Christ. The apostate church changed the ordinance of baptism. The Holy Ghost can be 51 received only after proper water baptism by immersion and the laying on of hands by authorized servants of God. Therefore, the members lost the only means by which man can say that "Jesus is the Lord" (See I Cor. 12:3). Baptism, having been changed, lost all its symbolism and meaning. Instead of administering the sacrament of the Lord's supper as emblems of his broken body and spilt blood, they invented the doctrine of transubstantiation. (This false doctrine claimed that by priestly power the emblems of Christ's flesh and blood are transmuted into the actual flesh and blood of the Redeemer.) The practice of celibacy among the clergy was established. The people were penalized for reading the scriptures. In short, the church completely departed from the plan of life as taught by Jesus and substituted doctrines and practices wholly at variance with the simple gospel of the Lord. (See Crark, J. REUBEN, JR., On the Way to Immortality and Eternal Life; and Barker, JAMES L., Protestors of Christendom. ) The author of our text summarizes the important internal causes of the apostasy under the three following headings: (1) The corrupting of the simple doctrines of the gospel of Christ by admix. Ture with so-called philosophic systems. (2) Unauthorized additions to the prescribed rites of the Church and the introduction of vital alterations in essential ordinances. (3) Unauthorized changes in Church organization and government. The world commenced _ to emerge from the period known as the Dark Ages in the fifteenth century. The movement is known as 2 the Renaissance or Revival of Learning. Strong men arose in a determined effort to arouse the people from indolence and ignorance. We regard it as the work of God in preparation for the restoration of the gospel and the establishment of the true Church of Jesus Christ. With the intellectual awakening and material betterment, people began to protest and then revolt against the abuses of members of the clergy who represented the ecclesiastical authority of the Pope at Rome. 'There was revolt in France as early as the thirteenth century. Early in the fourteenth century, John Wickliffe of Oxford University in England tefused to comply with the order that the people should not study the scriptures, and he gave to the world a version of the Holy Bible in English. For this he suffered severe persecution and, after his death, officials of the Roman church had his body exhumed and burned and his ashes scattered to the wind. Many other similar instances occurred. In the year 1517 Martin Luther, a German monk, led a revolt in Middle Europe which resulted in the establishment of Protestant churches in many countries, known as the Reformation. 'These Protestants, however, soon became divided on church government and doctrine. There was no divine authority in any of them and consequently they could not properly be guided in the gospel of the Savior. The Roman church resorted to extreme cruelty in trying to crush the Protestant movement. The torRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1951 tures inflicted on those accused of heresy are beyond description and, perhaps, no good would come from a detailed recital. We are interested more in the churches that came into existence as a result of the Reformation instigated by Luther. We must bear in mind that many honest men and women were still trying to follow Christ and many gave their lives rather than to stultify themselves by denying that which they believed to be true. On the other hand, many wicked men used the "cloak of religion" to gain desired results. As an example, Henry VIII, King of England, in the early stages of Luther's movement, declared that he was a supporter of the Pope and was given the title of | "Defender of the Faith." A few years later, however, this king wanted to divorce his wife, Queen Catherine, in order that he might marry another. In 1534, the British Parliament passed an act declaring the nation free from all allegiance to the Pope. It also passed an act making the king the head of the Church of England. It cannot be denied that this church came into existence as the direct result of the "licentious amours of a debauched and infamous king" who provided his own clergy and proclaimed himself the head of spiritual as well as temporal matters. There was no divine commission, notwithstanding Paul affirms: "no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron" (Heb. 5:4), as stated above. Aaron was called by direct revelation. In Great Britain and in many other countries of Europe there . Liberties. LESSON DEPARTMENT was bitter hatred and warfare between Catholics and Protestants. The latter, especially, went to excesses with their newly acquired "The mis-called Age of Reason, and the atheistical abominations culminating in the French Revolution stand as an ineftaceable testimony of what man may become when glorying in his denial of God." 'The world today is threatened again by forces that deny God and reject his love and mercy. Men, unauthorized of God, have organized literally hundreds _ of churches. 'These churches have been named for men or "from the circumstances of their origin'; some are known because of distinctive doctrines. It is significant and challenging that in the beginning of the year 1830 there was no church on the earth that bore the name of Jesus Christ. Further there was only one church—the Catholic—that claimed authority to act for the Lord by succession, and none by direct revelation. If we are convinced that the original Church lost its authority through apostasy, then surely no - other church could claim the right to officiate in the laws and ordinances of the gospel until divine authority was again restored. Many thoughtful men have admitted frankly the lack of divine authority in the world. It is worthy of note that the Church of England admits an awful state of apostasy in the "Homily Against Peril of Idolatry," published during the sixteenth century. Let us consider one sentence: So that laity unlearned, all ages, sects, and degrees of and clergy, learned and 33 men, women, and children of whole Christendom—an hornble and _ most dreadful thing to think—have been at once drowned in abominable idolatry; of all other vices most detested of God, and most damnable to man; and that by the space of eight hundred years ana more. So, we may conclude that God always gives to people "all that he seeth fit that they should have" (B. Of M, Alma 29:8). We may well add that he gives them all that they will receive. During the period of the universal apostasy, the spirit of God strove with men and influenced them greatly. John, the apostle, and the three Nephites ministered somewhere on the face of the earth. No doubt during that time good men and women did the best they could in carrying out what they believed was the will of God; but the churches organized by human beings were without divine authority. Only one church claimed a direct line of authority back to Jesus Christ and we have shown how that church completely lost its power through apostasy and _ sin. This is all in accordance with the prophecies found in the Holy Bible. Individual characters such as Columbus, Washington, the Pilgrim Fathers, and others too numerous to mention, were led by the inspiration of God to do great and marvelous things in preparation for the restoration of the gospel. We have direct revelation affirming that God raised up wise men to write the Constitution of the United States. He guided the founders of this great Government. But this inspiration and help from the Lord must not be mistaken for direct revelation given to 54 prophets and apostles who stand with power and authority at the head of the true Church of Jesus the Christ. "Through the operation of the genius of intelligence, which is the Spirit of Truth, the soul of the race had been undergoing a preparation," and, in 1820, the Eternal Father and Jesus our Lord came to earth and inaugurated the great dispensation of the fulness of times. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1951 Questions and Suggestions for Discussion 1. Enumerate the main causes which led to the apostasy. 2. What led to the division of the Roman and Greek Catholic churches? 3. Name some of the principles and ordinances of the true gospel which were changed during the apostasy. 4. What led to the establishment of the Church of England? 5. Discuss the Renaissance. Visiting Seacher ITlessages— Our Savior Speaks Lesson 15—"And Jesus Answering Saith Unto Them, Have Faith In God" (Mark 11:22). Mary Grant Judd For Tuesday, April 3, 1951 Objective: "ST'AITH," says President David O. McKay, "is an anchor to the soul of man which brings blessings and peace.". The trouble today is that modem man, in his self-sufficiency, depends upon his own strength, failing to even admit the need for the anchor of faith in God. Indifference is one of the dangers that seriously threaten us. When man finds the world in chaos, he fails to blame himself. And yet whose fault is it, if not his? Chase S. Osborn, one of America's hopeful philosophers, in a letter to a friend recently said: You ask when things are going to be better. I might retort by asking "what things?" There is absolutely nothing wrong with the earth. The sun performs its functions. The earth is still in its orbit To point out that faith in God is fundamental to true success in life. And on its axis. The clouds move hither and thither as usual and drench the thirsty footstool. The soil has all the elements of nourishment that sustain human life and everything else that it ever had. There is nothing wrong with the earth and with heaven, but somewhere between there has been a good deal of a mess. What then is wrong? It must be man. As Shakespeare expressed it, "The fault... Is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings." Charles A. Lindbergh, the first man to solo the Atlantic, recently called upon scientists "for a reorientation of our standards to place the character of man above the value of his products." It was a simple, childlike faith in God that was taught by the LESSON DEPARTMENT Christ. "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you," he told his disciples (Matt. 7:7). These promises our Savior is ready to make good in our day. But it must be realized that it will only be through our individual effort. The acquiring of faith is a personal thing. No one else can give it to us, although they may help in its attainment. It must come from 59 within as a result of a quickening of the spirit which produces an inner conviction. Faith must come from the spiritual part of our beings. It is the eternal part of our natures that is nurtured when we increase our faith in God. Let us understand the importance of this admonition of Christ and make it active in our lives, "Have faith in God." Work ITleeting—The Art of Homemaking (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting) Lesson 7—Pictures, Mirrors, and Wall Accessories Christine H. Robinson For Tuesday, April 10, 1951 CONSIDERABLE time and thought can be expended in selecting colors and arranging furniture, but, if any important decorative details in your home are overlooked, the attractive, livable results desired may not be achieved. One of these important details, all too frequently overlooked, is the proper use of wall hangings, including pictures, mirrors, brackets, and other wall accessories. Wall hangings of all types provide an unusual opportunity for you to give your home that personal touch. With the possible exception of draperies, there is no other phase of home decorating in which individuality can be expressed so quickly, effectively, and inexpensively as in the selection and placement of pictures and other wall hangings. Pictures can flatter and dress up a wall; they can dramatize a furniture grouping; they can make a small piece of furniture appear important and they can provide that added touch which gives a room interest, balance, and hospitality. In selecting pictures, avoid the error of buying just anything to fill up wall space. Select your pictures as carefully as any other item in your home furnishings, paying particular attention to color, size, and type. Remember that color in pictures can make or break a room's decoration. If colors in a picture clash with patterned wallpaper, or with colors or design in furniture, the effect will be confusing and uninteresting. If, on the other hand, your pictures pick up and accent the colors in your draperies, upholstery, 56 tug, and walls, the effect will be pleasing and harmonious. The size of pictures, also, is important. 'The picture or picture grouping should bear a proper relationship in size to the furniture with which it is used, and also to the wall area occupied. In determining the size of your pictures, do not feel that you must always choose single, large ones. A wall area which requires a considerable amount of coverage often can be more effectively treated with a group of smaller pictures than with a large single one. Good decorating recommends that small pictures should not be scattered around the room, but, rather, should be grouped together on wall areas or over furniture groups or pieces which you wish to emphasize or dramatize. In creating these groups, the pictures should be arranged to form horizontal and vertical rectangles, squares, or triangles. Pictures should not be hung in step-up fashion unless running up a staircase. All pictures in the _ group should be hung close together so that they form an integral unit, to give a feeling of one large picture. In forming a group of pictures, be sure the subjects are related.. For instance, you would not hang oil paintings, flower or bird prints, and etchings in the same group. You can, however, use various types of pictures in the same room, but not in the same group. One way to be sure of an interesting arrangement without marring your walls, is to arrange the pictures first on the floor, and then cut patterns of them out of brown paper and attach these _ together with Scotch tape. Try this RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1951 pattern on the wall for size and interest. If it creates the desired effect, then hang the pictures themselves exactly as the pattern. For interest and balance, pictures should form a part of a furniture grouping, and not hang in independent areas of their own. When hung over a chest or sofa they should be hung close enough together to form a single unit. Pictures should be hung low, placed flat against the wall, and set so that neither cord nor nails show. When two or more pictures are hung together, the bottom line of the frames should be on the same level regardless of the size of the pictures. In order to get the maximum pleasure and decorative effect from your pictures, they need not be expensive commercial oils or prints. You can have fun assembling and framing your own. Try cutting various flower pictures from a seed catalogue, arranging them artistically to form a bouquet on a large colored piece of blotting paper. Frame the pictures yourself with molding purchased from your lumber dealer, after painting the molding a harmonious color. Flower or bird prints can often be found in magazines. You can mount these on colored mats that pick up a color from the print and hang in groups for an effective splash of color in your room. Use your imagination, and you will think of many more interesting and helpful ideas. Remember, in framing your pictures, the rules are simple— express your own personality, suit the frame to the picture itself and to the character of your room. The same basic principles of good taste and judgment applied to the LESSON DEPARTMENT use of pictures also apply to the selection and hanging of mirrors. Mirrors add life, gaiety, and spaciousness to a home and perform a function which cannot be filled by any other type of home furnishing. In hanging your mirrors, see that they reflect something interesting and that their size is appropriate to the wall space. If a mirror is too small for proper balance over a piece of furniture or on a wall area, it can be built out by hanging, on each side, a group of pictures, colorful china plates, or wall brackets holding interesting objects. In decorating your walls do not overlook the possibilities of brackets and colorful plates. These can be used to add importance and size a7 to a picture or mirror, or they can be used in interesting groups of their own. In using plates as wall decorations, again make sure they express the feeling of your room, formality or informality, and that they have the same general coloring as the rest of your room. Discussion Points 1. Discuss the importance of pictures and wall hangings which express the character of a room. 2. Give ideas on framing pictures. Why, with the exception of oil paintings, should most pictures have mats? 3. Demonstrate various ways of hanging a group of pictures. 4. Show how a small piece of furniture can be made to look important by the use of suitable wall decorations. Ie eagle — ine Literature of England Lesson 15—Oliver Goldsmith Elder Briant S. Jacobs For Tuesday, April 17, 1951 HE need to look at a man's face in order to "know" either him or his works is a strong and natural one, but there is something of the mystical about it as well. In seeing an author's likeness, most of us like to flatter ourselves that in his features we can discern the qualities which characterize the most intimate self-revelation which, recorded in communicable form, has come to be known as literature. 'The process also works in reverse: oftentimes, while reading a passage which is so particularly immediate that it comes alive in our imagination suddenly, and without being summoned, the image of the author looms heavily across our subconscious mental screen, almost like Hamlet's ghost. Instantaneously, we relate the essence of the passage to the personal traits we like to see in his face and say within ourselves, "Yes, this indeed is his. I see it all, now, and all is one. His looks are of the same breed as his poetry. I like them both." When Sir Joshua Reynolds painted the portrait of his friend Oliver Goldsmith, he caught those qualities (or at least seemed to) which 58 made Goldsmith the most charming, graceful stylist of his century, and one of the most pleasant writers one will ever read. A full, high forehead, heavy eyebrows, large, alert eyes, a mouth delicately shaped, yet full, and rounded cheeks, still scarred by the pox which had dishgured him as a child and which made him resent his ugliness even as he did his poverty. "Here," we might say, "is a man neither cunning, aloof, nor profound. His eye seems poised between a wink and a perpetual twinkle. From the side view portrait he might well turn to us full face, with warmth and cheer radiating toward us, unknown to him as we are. Having just met him, nonetheless we feel him to be one of us. Even as he seems to enjoy life, here is someone to enjoy. Tell us more about him." Whether such thoughts originate from the portrait alone, from his works alone, or from a combination of the two, is a mystery, but an unimportant one. The fact remains that such impressions arise, and pervade our acquaintance with every aspect of the man. But there is one other significant point in Reynolds' interpretation of Oliver Goldsmith that merits comment. In the portrait Goldsmith's left hand rests upon an open notebook; his right hand, holding a nibbed goose quill, is poised above the page, as if waiting for the proper phrasing to come before recording it. While he did not find himself as a writer until he was nearly thirty years of age, Goldsmith for decades fought off starvation with his pen as his sole weapon. During these desperate years of struggle he proRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1951 A Perry Picture Copyright 1909 OLIVER GOLDSMITH 1728-1774 duced a volume of work which even ° by his fellow hack writers would be considered vast. He contributed to at least ten different periodicals, and wrote, revised, translated, compiled, or supervised at least forty volumes of work, some of them as sizeable as his eight-volume History of the Earth and Animated Nature. Nor did he receive just pay for his labors, since he was helpless to prevent his work for periodicals from being pirated by other publications. As he once remarked, "If there be a pride in multiple editions, I have seen some of my labors sixteen times reprinted, and claimed by different parents as their own." We must also credit his achievement on a level higher than writing LESSON DEPARTMENT to keep from starving. Like Dryden, in the generation preceding, Goldsmith wrote and excelled in drama, poetry, and essay. Goldsmith wrote as well the most popular novel of the century, The Vicar of Wakefield, which has also proved to be one of the best-known novels of the English people. Judging by his versatile excellences in polite literature, we can see how far he rose above a lowly beginning and long years of wasted young manhood. Oliver Goldsmith was born in 1728 in rural Ireland, and though he left Ireland forever at twentythree, he always carried in his heart the warm Irish virtues; he was carefree, considerate, and willing to give his friends whatever he had. His kind uncle sent him to Trinity College in Dublin, but school work bored him. After dunking a teacher in a well, Goldsmith impetuously sold his books and was ready to seek his fortune in America, but his uncle persuaded him to return to college. He finally managed to graduate at twenty-one, but he was near the bottom of his class. Behind him he left a reputation for unpaid bills, and for selling his ballads for five shillings apiece, then sneaking out at night to hear them sung in the local taverns. After college he enjoyed life and youth by staying for a time with various relatives, fishing and hunting in the countryside, playing his flute to the accompaniment of his cousin at the harpsichord, and enjoying the local tavern society. When his application to take religious orders was denied, Goldsmith started for London to become a lawyer, but in Dublin he gambled away the fifty 59 pounds his uncle had given him and returned home. Next his uncle financed him in his desire to become a doctor. He stayed in Edinburgh for a time, then Leyden, and finally walked throughout most of the countries of Europe on a grand tour of enjoyment and ease, paying his way by playing the flute and debating before learned groups. He returned penniless, and in rapid order was an apothecary's assistant, a school teacher, a poor man's physician, a printer's devil, and finally a hack writer in London's famous Grub Street. In 1760-1761 Goldsmith wrote his most important series of essays, which were collected the following year as The Citizen of the World: Or, Letters from a Chinese Philosopher Residing in London to His Friends in the East (text, pp. 1024- 1032). Here, as always in Goldsmith, we see him drawing almost entirely on personal experience for material; he appraised England with the traveler's eye which he had acquired during his European jaunt. Because of the intensifying interest in the Orient, he found it advantageous to make the narrator a Chinese. The Oriental viewpoint was also useful because Goldsmith wished to point out the foibles of England by showing how unreasonable they were, and the Chinese were noted for their cool wisdom and common sense. But it was not so much this device as it was his style which charmed his audience. These essays, written in the manner of Addison and Steele, are not only smooth and graceful; they are informal, and warm, flowing with the freshness of a personality who 60 writes for the joy of writing, just as he lived and laughed and sang for the joys of living happily. 'The charm of his style is unique, since it is the charm of Goldsmith himself, who was vivid, fluent, and always at his ease. 'The musical, flowing quality of his style is undeniable from the first sentence: May the wings of peace rest upon thy dwelling, and the shield of conscience preserve thee from vice and misery! (text, page 1025) These essays are satirical, but of a warmer, kindlier tone than we have studied earlier. After poking mild fun at the British for being such sea-dogs, he calls London gloomy, and describes "a great lazy puddle" which were her streets, her dingy architecture, and the unimaginative quality of her riches: "A man's riches may be seen in his eyes: if we judge of the English by this rule, there is not a poorer nation under the sun." Letter III praises reason, points that such variables as the definition of female beauty depends on the point of view, and chides the English gentleman and gentlewoman for the foolish fads they worship as aids to what they define as personal beauty. In Letter IV he finds the English proud, unwilling to be the first to speak, ignorant of the true meaning of liberty, far too willing to tell the King how the country should be run, and valuing esteem and _position more than love and social enjoyment of friends. Letter CVI satirizes the custom of honoring the dead by writing poetry which is mechanically written by the undertaker as a part of his service. The RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1951 following passage might well be autobiographical:... I am induced to pity the poet, whose trade is thus to make demigods and heroes for a dinner. There is not in nature a more dismal figure than a. Man who sits down to premeditated flattery: every stanza he writes tacitly reproaches the meanness of his occupation, till, at last, his stupidity becomes more stupid, and his dullness more diminutive (text page 1030). His creation of Beau Tibbs (text, page 1031) is a masterful piece of writing. In less than a page and a half we come to know him intimately: his pretense at wealth while he is in want; his ability to lie so habitually that he cannot remember truth; his fawning agreement with whatever is said in order to please; his fundamental hypocrisy; and finally, the climax of all his previous small talk:. But dear Drybone, you are an honest creature, lend me half-a-crown for a minute or two, or so,_ just till—but hearkee, ask me for it the next time we meet, or it may be twenty to one but I forget to pay you (10, text, page 1032). Herein is the very stuff of which we weak humans are made. Soon after coming to London, Goldsmith became an intimate of Samuel Johnson, a great distinction for anyone. When Johnson founded his "Club" in 1764, "Goldy," was a charter member—"Goldy," whom everyone liked—even Boswell, who sometimes seemed slightly jealous of his wit and nearness to Johnson. It was Goldsmith who stood alone against the great roarings of Johnson, ignoring the condemnations and bluster as if he LESSON DEPARTMENT didn't know he was the object of the "Great Bears," attack, and soon they would once more be on the friendliest of terms. And it was Johnson who rescued "Goldy" from a landlady who had him arrested for not paying his rent by taking Goldsmith's novel to the printer and returning the sixty pounds to the author. It was in this novel, The Vicar of Wakefield, that Goldsmith immortalized his clergyman father as Dr. Primrose, the simple, kind, but impractical man who has stolen the hearts of generations of readers. Later on, in 1771, Goldsmith achieved equal success on the stage when, in his She Stoops to Conquer (text, page 1039), he also used an actual incident from his own boyhood as the plot for this comedy, which still remains one of our best. But now we should consider his verse, particularly his best and most famous poem, The Deserted Village (text, page 1032), published in 1770. Fight years earlier Goldsmith had published an essay, "The Revolution in Low Life," in which he stated the same convictions as those of his greatest poem. England was rapidly being transformed from an agricultural nation into an industrial one, and in this transition the rights, and consequently the innocent happiness of the rural peasantry, were being harshly violated and finally made extinct. The Deserted Village appears on the surface to be a satire on the luxury-loving wealthy class and their callous destruction of entire villages in order to enlarge their estates and beautify them through extensive _ landscaping. Elsewhere he had praised material 61 progress, nor does he oppose it now; he does oppose the insane love of luxury which sudden industrial and commercial wealth had brought to the upper classes. The poem consists of the poet's memories of his boyhood village of Auburn as now he pokes among the uncultivated wildernesses where once it stood. Frequently he pauses in his bitter comparison between then and now to exclaim, O luxury, thou cursed by Heaven's decree How ill exchanged are things like these for thee! How do thy potions, with insidious joy, Diffuse their pleasures only to destroy! (385-388, text, page 1038) Actually, the poem achieves its universal appeal, not in condemning luxury, but in presenting, through selected detail and powerful sentiment, the bygone days of the pure rural virtues and the complementing joys of youth and old age living together. Here we find the melancholy longing for the blissful yesterdays which was to play so strong a role in nineteenth-century Romanticism. Indeed, the range of sentimental appeal is so broad that almost everyone finds in the poem a description somewhat approximating his present frame of mind, whatever it might be. If the reader is young, he identifies himself with The bashful virgin's side-long looks of love. (29, text, page 1033) If he is old, he reads most carefully the following: I still had hopes, my latest hours to crown Amidst these humble bowers to lay me down; 62 To husband out life's taper at the close And keep the flame from wasting by repose. (85-89, text, page 1034) Should the reader be a mother, she sees herself as she.. " Kissed. Her thoughtless babes with many a tear And clasped them close in sorrow doubly dear. (381-382, text, page 1038) The father consoles his homeless wife in "silent manliness of grief," recalling that A time there was, ere England's griefs began, When every rood of ground maintained its man. Ww. Best companions, health; And his best riches, ignorance of wealth. (57-61, text, page 1033) His innocence and Further to intensify each reader's identification with the glorious past, Goldsmith next describes the church, the school, and the tavern: Yes: let the rich deride, the proud disdain, These simple blessings of the lowly train; To me more dear, congenial to my heart, One native charm, than all the gloss of art. (251-254, text, page 1036) Spontaneous joys, where nature has its play, The soul adopts and owns their first-born sway; Lightly they frolic o'er the vacant mind, Unenvied, unmolested, unconfined: But the long pomp, the midnight masquerade, With all the freaks of wanton wealth arrayed, In these, ere triflers half their wish obtain, The toiling pleasure sickens into pain, And, e'en while fashion's brightest arts decoy,. The heart distrusting asks, if this be joy. (255-264, text, page 1036) RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1951 Thus, in his flowing lines, Goldsmith described the warm humanity, the fruitful, carefree life of his boyhood in tones so rich with nostalgia and melancholy that the poem has come to be a minor English classic. His "Retaliation" (text, page 1039) reveals the convivial, hearty fun Goldsmith found in supping and talking with a group of the keen, accomplished men who above all else, were his friends. When David Garrick, the great actor, spontaneously composed the following epitaph for Goldsmith, Here lies Nolly Goldsmith, for shortness called Noll, Who wrote like an angel, but talked like poor Poll, he "retaliated" some weeks later with a friendly satirical sketch of each of his friends. While sometimes his tone bears a mild cutting edge, here predominantly is the sparkling wit and the joy that comes when "Good fellows get together." When Oliver Goldsmith died in his forty-sixth year, he took with him certain weaknesses which he never overcame. He spent far too much of his substance on elegant clothes; and was always giving far more than he should to his needy friends; consequently throughout his life, even when he made a good wage, he was so deeply in debt that at critical moments he had to leave town to escape his creditors. He was so engrossed with the joys of living that in many ways he was irresponsible. Yet beside his accomplishments such details hardly deserve mention. While he was not a great thinker, he was interested LESSON DEPARTMENT in ideas; in presenting his own to us he is never tedious nor depressing. Because of the charm of his personality and his style, his writings are pleasant and familiar. He enjoyed writing his views on a life which he found congenial and good; therefore we enjoy reading what was so happily penned. As Samuel Johnson said of him, "Let not his frailties be remembered; he was a very great man." 'The verdict of time has not proved Johnson wrong. 63 Questions for Discussion 1. Characterize Oliver Goldsmith: (a) as a man; (b) as a writer. 2. Was Goldsmith's youth entirely wasted? Discuss his early years as source material for his writings. 3. Discuss Goldsmith's literary _productiveness and versatility. 4. Why is Goldsmith's style so pleasant to read? 5. Why did Goldsmith write The Desetted Village? 6. If time permits, have several choice passages read from The Deserted Village. Social Sctence—The Progress of Man Part I—The Lesson of History Lesson 6—The Role of Ancient Israel Elder Archibald F. Bennett (Text: The Progress of Man, by Elder Joseph Fielding Smith, chapter 10.) For Tuesday, April 24, 1951 Objective: To portray how Israel's mission, as the Lord's chosen people, was to preserve in the world the knowledge of God and the true gospel, and to exercise divine authority for the good of all mankind. The Call of Abraham GOME seventeen hundred years before the birth of our Savior there lived in Ur of the Chaldees a young man who found himself very much out of harmony with his surroundings. The city of Erech, or Ur, as it is called in the scriptures, was a place of considerable importance in the land of Chaldea, about two thousand years B. C. At the time of which we write it was under the dominion of Pharaoh, King of Egypt. The inhabitants of the land had turned from the worship of the true God to the worship of the gods of the heathen. Abraham writes of these times as follows: My fathers having turned from their righteousness, and from the holy commandments which the Lord their God had given unto them, unto the worshiping of the gods of the heathen, utterly refused to hearken to my voice; For their hearts were set to do evil, and were wholly turned to the god of Elkenah, and the god of Libnah, and the god of Mahmackrah, and the god of Korash, and the god of Pharoah, king of Egypt; Therefore they turned their hearts to the sacrifice of the heathen in offering up their children unto their dumb idols, and hearkened not unto my voice, but endeavored to take away my life by the hand of the priest of Elkenah. The priest of Elkenah was also the priest of Pharaoh (Pearl of Great Price, Abraham 1:5-7). 64 Now Abraham had refused to follow the teachings of his fathers for he had in his hands the records which had come down from the earliest fathers, containing the history of the patriarchs from the days of Adam to his own time, which the Lord had preserved in his hands. In this manner, and perhaps because Abraham had also listened to the teachings of Noah and Shem, he understood the truth. Under all these conditions, and finding opposition even in his own household, Abraham found it necessary to leave his place of residence. Abraham was a prayerful man, and it was in answer to his fervent prayer that the Lord spoke to him saying: "Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will show thee" (Pearl of Great Price, Abraham 2:3). 'Therefore he left the land of Ur to go into the land of Canaan, taking with him his wife, his brother's son and his wife, and also his father who had consented to go because of the severity of the famine. The Lord's Covenant with Abraham For a time Abraham and his colony dwelt in a place they called Haran, presumably named after Abraham's brother who was the father of Lot. In the land of Haran the word of the Lord came to Abraham again:... Arise, and take Lot with thee; for I have purposed to take thee away out of Haran, and to make of thee a minister to bear my naine in a strange land which I will give unto thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession, when they hearken to my voice (Pearl of Great Price, Abraham 2:6). " RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1951 Terah, the father of Abraham, found Haran a pleasant place and he remained there, having turned again to his idolatry. Abraham, in answer to this call of the Lord, journeyed on until he arrived in Canaan. Here Abraham manifested his faith and integrity before the Lord in his willingness to offer his dearest possession, his son Isaac, upon the altar of sacrifice, at the command of the Lord. 'Thus being proved and found not wanting, Abraham was greatly blessed. (See Abraham 2:8-11.) We have already mentioned the fact that the Lord would have gladly conferred the blessings of the gospel and the power of the Priesthood upon all peoples, if they would have received it, but in their failure he called Abraham and placed upon him this wonderful blessing, because of his faithfulness. 'This honor and blessing places Abraham as the father of all those who receive the gospel from his day to the end of time. No person can receive the gospel and the Priesthood without becoming of the seed of Abraham. The scattering of Israel, which came because of rebellion, the Lord turned into a blessing in behalf of other nations by infusing the blood of Abraham among other peoples. The House of Israel We are informed that there were certain intelligences who were entitled to come to the earth through a chosen lineage. 'These are the spirits who have belonged to the house of Israel and who were separated before the Lord divided the inheritances among the nations. (See Deut. 32:7-9; Acts 17:26.) LESSON DEPARTMENT The promised blessings given to Abraham have come down more particularly through the seed of Isaac and Jacob, son and grandson of Abraham, respectively. Jacob, son of Isaac, is spoken of as the founder of the house of Israel. His name was changed by divine edict from Jacob to Israel. Jacob had four wives and twelve sons. These twelve sons became the heads of the twelve tribes of Israel, with this exception: When Jacob went down into Egypt and found Joseph there, who had been sold by his brothers, he also found that Joseph had two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. The Lord directed Jacob to adopt these two grandsons as his own. Jacob, by blessing and adoption, took these two sons of Joseph and numbered them with his own sons, saying that all the other children of Joseph should also be named after Ephraim and Manasseh and be numbered among the tribes issuing from these two sons. The choosing of these two grandsons to be the heads of tribes in Israel did not increase the number of tribes from twelve to fourteen, however. The Lord _ blessed Joseph with a double portion because of his faithfulness. He does not appear by name as a tribe, but is represented by his two sons. Later, when the children of Israel came out of Egypt, the Lord instructed Moses to take the males of the tribe of Levi and make them priests of the people. In this capacity, they were not to be numbered as a tribe, but were to be scattered among the people. We see, then, that the number of the tribes remained at twelve, two of the sons of Joseph replacing 65 two of the sons of Israel in the reckoning. The Day of Israel's Greatness It was decreed by the Almighty, according to the promise of Abraham, that the Israelites should remain in Egypt for a period. During this time they were to grow into a mighty people. In keeping with this prediction Israel went down into Egypt and there remained four hundred years. In the fourth generation under Moses a great multitude of people came out of Egypt, for the time had come for them to possess their inheritance in the land of Canaan. When they entered into the land to possess it, the Lord gave them definite and pointed instructions. They were admonished and commanded to keep the statutes and judgments thus given unto them. They were promised if they would do so that they would always possess the land in peace and safety, the land would produce in abundance, happiness and __ prosperity should follow them all their days; and they would have the constant companionship and blessings of righteous leaders, and the revelations of heaven. Israel was duly warned that if the people rebelled against the Lord, and refused to accept his statutes and judgments, and to hearken to his prophets, that a curse would be placed upon the land. All kinds of trouble and sorrow would be meted out to them, and they would find themselves in bondage to other peoples. Nor was this all, it was predicted the time would come when they would be driven forth 66 from the land and scattered among all peoples. From the days of Moses until the days of the prophet Samuel, Israel was governed by judges raised up from among the people. In the days of Samuel they demanded a king. They desired to be ruled by a king as were the nations around them. So Israel was given a king. Saul, son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin, was chosen. His story is a sad one. In course of time Saul became arrogant, selfish, and cruel, and lost his kingdom. He was succeeded by David, son of Jesse, of the tribe of Judah. Once again a righteous and goodly person was chosen, for David was a man of exceptional faith and great ability. Yet, even with David, power brought him to the verge of destruction. Apostasy and Captivity Following the reign of the third king, Solomon, who was honored with the duty of building the temple, there came a division among the people. Ten of the twelve tribes rebelled, and set up another kingdom. These two kingdoms existed side by side until about 730 B. C., when the ten tribes, known as the kingdom of Israel, were carried off captive into Assyria by Shalmaneser. From that captivity they never returned to their own land, and are known as the Lost Tribes to this day. The Lord had set prophets among them, but their warnings were not heeded and the Lord fulfilled his promise made through Moses that they should be banished from the land. The other kingdom, comprising the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1951 and known as the kingdom of Judah, remained in their inheritance until about the time that Lehi left Jerusalem, 600 sB. C. The people were inclined to repent more readily and therefore the Lord spared them a little longer than their kinsmen of the northern kingdom. Eventually, however, their iniquity brought this kingdom to its end. They were carried off captive by Nebuchadnezzar in the reign of Zedekiah and planted in the land of Babylon. A State of Wicked Rebellion They remained in Babylon seventy years. Then under the reign of the Persians, they were privileged to return. In the land of Babylon, under their suffering, they had lost their besetting sin, that of idol worship. Again they built the temple. Again a measure of prosperity came to them. And again their repentance did not last very long before once more they had fallen into grievous sin. Much of this time was spent in spiritual darkness, and a portion of their subsequent history is recorded in the Apocrypha. When Christ came he found the Jews in a state of most wicked apostasy, perhaps such as had never been known among their people amidst their darkest hours of unbelief while governed by their kings. When they cried out against the Son of God, who came to bring them the fulness of salvation, the anger of the AImighty was kindled against them, and they were persecuted, driven, and scattered, until they became a hiss and a byword among all nations. LESSON DEPARTMENT A Day of Fulfillment Promised Today the words of the prophets are being fulfilled. Judah is being gathered. Jerusalem is being rebuilt and the Lord is preparing to redeem his ancient people. Eventually they will be sitting under their own vine and fig tree, enjoying the fulness of the gospel, and the blessings of the house of the Lord, in fulfillment of the words of Ezekiel: Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them, it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore (Ezekiel 37:26). Thoughts for Discussion 1. What was the distinctive mission of Israel in the world? 2. Why was Israel made a chosen nation so greatly blessed? 67 3. What is the chief lesson to be learned from the history of the house of Israel? 4. Are there evidences of progression and retrogression in the history of Israel? 5. Have a class member assigned to prepare and enumerate the essentials of the covenant the Lord made with Abraham and his posterity as to: a. Numbers b. Bearing the gospel to all nations c. The Priesthood d. Bringing blessings to all families of the earth e. Everlasting land inheritance. 6. Have parts of the covenants been fulfilled? If not, will they yet be? 7. Show how the dispersion of Israel has proved a blessing to the nations. 8. Will any of the covenants of the Lord with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph and Ephraim fail to be fulfilled?

Nlustec—Fundamentals of Musicianship CONDUCTING, SINGING, AND ACCOMPANYING 'For Music Department at Union Meeting) Textbook: Fundamentals of Conducting, by J. Spencer Cornwall. Lesson 7—Theories Underlying Singing, Accompanying, and Conducting Florence J]. Madsen Objective: To focus attention on the importance of harmonious activity between singers, accompanist, and conductor. 1. Interpretation of Song Material (a) The duty of the interpreter of music is to bring out of a composition its full meaning and significance; to express beautifully and simply the intent of the composer. (b) In singing there are two mediums through which to work—the music and the text. The first consideration should be given to the text. The poem which, though lovely, might have lived only in the memories of the few, when united with a melody of sustaining tones, with repeated sentences, declamatory words, increasing volume and height, or diminishing power and range, evolves as a message of lasting worth and lives in the hearts of the many. 2. Theories Underlying Singing "|..
