JULY 1968 | Magazine | By AXE AT THE ROOT They built a country with logs, The kind that grow in forests So untouched that only wild things Pathed there. The logs went into houses For people to be born in And die in. In between these events they Cut down more logs For schoolhouses, say Or meetinghouses, say Or townhalls, say They learned to read and Write in the schoolhouses On the log benches. This country went to church On Sundays, To log churches, To log benches And trembled at the thought of God's wrath. The trembling made them clean And gave them wisdom. Then the log hewers And the log builders And the log sitters Went home to their milk and bread Suppers, and planned for their children What they would build for them.

From Near and Far
When I arose this morning, I saw the beautiful April Magazine lying on the table in
the sunlight. The "Symphony of Blossoms" is lovely on the cover (transparency by
Camera Clix). The frontispiece photograph ("Nest in the Blossoms," Luoma Photos)
and the poem "Love Comes on Little Wings" are a delight. I particularly liked the
editorial "On Graciousness," by Marianne C. Sharp. We could all use more of
graciousness. Elizabeth C. McCrimmon, Long Beach, California

I have been meaning to write sooner to let you know how much I enjoy the Magazine,
but I am like most people, I put off writing the words of appreciation. I have a
serious heart condition, and my sweet daughter, Mrs. Sheryn Beck, prescribed the
Magazine for me. I receive it every month and read every page. I keep all the Magazines,
and eventually present them to the hospital here.

Mrs. Roy Green, Sparks, Nevada

Please accept my thanks for publishing my articles and stories in The Relief Society
Magazine. Because I teach school during the day, I do not have the opportunity of
going to Relief Society, but our wonderful Magazine brings to me each month so
much that is good and beautiful in each one of the inspirational lessons that I feel
grateful for this priceless publication. And the editorials have no peers.

Sylvia Probst Young, Midvale, Utah

Having been a subscriber to The Relief Society Magazine for about twenty years,
I have found many thoughtful and rewarding hours reading the splendid material.
I have always felt that the Magazine is read more thoroughly than any other magazine
in the Church. Mildred N. Israelsen, Logan, Utah

Out here in the mission field, we hold precious every part of the gospel. The Relief
Society Magazine is like a beacon light to us. It gives us strength to hold fast
to the gospel. It is our lifeline with Zion.

Loretta A. Barlow, Bay City, Texas

The article describing the Homemaking Department at Relief Society Annual General
Conference (by Edythe K. Watson, March 1968) is an impelling incentive to more
gracious homemaking. The pictures are tempting. We have always been a people
with a desire to restore and preserve anything lovely, praiseworthy, or of precious
value. Here we are again, reclaiming treasures from the past to enhance the beauty
of today's handiwork.

Wanda Rhodes, Logan, Utah

Thanks for the thrill of seeing my story in print ("A Summer's Day," March 1968),
and I thank Mary Scopes for her lovely illustration.

Ruth Pepper, Corrimal East, N.S.W. Australia

How can I express my love for The Relief Society Magazine? It has added so much
to my life. Each article, poem, and story has its own special effect.

Elma C. Palmer, Tiffany, Colorado

I enjoyed the story by Janice T. Dixon "Say Peanut Butter," in the May issue of the
Magazine. It was interesting in looking over the Magazine Honor Roll to see how
many readers the Magazine has now—imagine, the Magazine in 271,400 homes.

Frances C. Yost, Bancroft, Idaho

I must tell you that I made two gingerbread houses from the recipe in the December
Magazine (by Berta Mae Peek). I gave one to some little friends of mine and the
other to my own children. All were delighted. I was surprised to find how easy it
was to make the houses and how beautiful they were. I am planning to make more
cakes next year.

NATIONAL COUNCIL OF WOMEN OF THE UNITED STATES OBSERVES EIGHTIETH ANNIVERSARY President Belle S. Spafford

The grand ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City was the setting, on April 1, 1968, for an auspicious occasion in the history of the National Council of Women of the United States. A beautifully appointed luncheon meeting designated as "A First Lady's Luncheon," marked the eightieth anniversary of the founding of the National Council of Women of the United States and, at the same time, the founding of the International Council of Women.

Established primarily in the interest of woman's suffrage, the N. C. W., through the years, has extended its interests and influence in harmony with the preamble to its constitution adopted at the organization meeting, which embodies the governing principles of the institution today: We, women of the United States, sincerely believing that the best good of our homes and nation will be advanced by our own greater unity of thought, sympathy and purpose, and that an organized movement will best conserve the highest good of the family and State, do hereby band ourselves together in a confederation of workers committed to the overthrow of all forms of ignorance and injustice, and to the application of the Golden Rule in society, custom and law.

The precise measure of the accomplishments of the Council would be impossible to determine. We must concede, however, that, for over three quarters of a century, it has had a far-reaching influence for good in the life of the Nation and in the wellbeing of womankind. The eightieth anniversary function was sponsored by the Council with Mrs. Louis J. Robbins (Millie) presiding and conducting. Seated with her on the dais were the present officers of the Council, the president of the I. C. W., Mrs. Erwin Schuller, the program speakers, and a few women who received the Council's "Woman of Conscience" award for distinguished community service.

There were more than 700 women in attendance, with sixty-one countries of the world represented. There are sixty-two countries with organized national councils which are members of the I. C. W. Of these sixty-two councils, forty-one were represented at the luncheon meeting honoring the N. C. W. Of the United States, which was the first national council to be established in the world.

The achievements of woman and the scope of her interest and services were evidenced in the following professional groups represented by distinguished leaders at this impressive anniversary function: music; art; the theater; fashion designing; interior designing; law; public relations; publishing; advertising; economics; medicine; nursing; government— one ambassador, two city mayors, and other governmental units; department store officials; stock brokers; industries; secretarial groups; and volunteer organizations.

The program aimed to recognize the past in the world of woman, her place today, and what may be expected of her tomorrow. Relief Society was highly honored in having its General President, Belle S. Spafford, the featured speaker. Billed on the printed program "A First Lady" In civic work, her subject dealt with the founding and history of the Council and was designed to show how the past influenced the present.

Cornelia Otis Skinner, well-known author, actress, and lecturer, billed "A First Lady" in the arts, delightfully described what the theater was like across the country eighty years ago. Dr. Benetta B. Washington, director of the woman's job corps, billed "A First Lady" in education, impressively depicted how the present influences the future.

Speakers were introduced by The National Council of Women President Robbins—poised, dignified, and charmingly attractive in a modest, fashionably designed sunshine-yellow dress enhancing her simply styled dark hair and sparkling eyes. In introducing each speaker, Mrs. Robbins referred to her major interests, activities, and leadership achievements in areas of concern to women. Her introductions reflected her depth of understanding of the purposes of the Council and her earnest conviction that organized women can contribute toward a better world.

This anniversary meeting came at an uneasy moment in the history of our Nation and at a critical world period. Sensitive to conditions, the notable, serious-minded women leaders assembled in honor of the founding of the Councils of Women, came not in a spirit of celebration, but in a spirit of dedication—dedication to intensified and intelligently directed efforts that would contribute toward resolving the causes of national unrest and world crises.

Relief Society and The Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association, both of which were charter members of the N. C. W. Of the United States, and by virtue of this membership, affiliates of the International Council of Women, were represented at this important gathering of women by their respective presidents, as well as by other Latter-day Saint women leaders.

A natural pride was felt in seeing on the dais in her position as Fourth Vice-President of the Council an outstanding Latter-day Saint woman, Mrs. John Q. Cannon (Anna Laura Stohl)—a 485 July 1968 daughter-in-law of Annie Wells Cannon, lovingly remembered and honored by Latter-day Saint women for her Church and community service; a granddaughter-in-law of Emmeline B. Wells, fourth General President of Relief Society and one of the foremost early-day suffrage leaders, an intimate friend of Susan B. Anthony and an active participant in N. C. W. Affairs during her day.

These two Church women's auxiliaries—the Relief Society and the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association—are two of the remaining three charter members of the Council. A simple but effective exhibit of the work of both organizations was displayed in a room adjoining the ballroom, along with displays of other member organizations of the Council. They attracted considerable attention.

Through the years, Relief Society and the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association have benefited through their membership in the Councils and we trust they have contributed to the accomplishments of their great purposes.

(Delivered at the Eightieth Anniversary Luncheon Meeting of the Founding of the National Council of Women of the United States, held April 1, 1968, at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, New York, N. Y.)

A newspaper columnist, speaking recently of the present day, referred to it as "woman's era—her triumphant day of achievement." Certainly it is a day when, in most countries of the world, discrimination against woman because of her sex, in large measure, has been removed. Today she is a person of consequence in national and international affairs. In our own great Nation, doors of opportunity are invitingly open to her in the fields of business and the professions, and she is steadily making inroads into the top policy-making levels of government.

There is scarcely any field of human endeavor she may not enter if she wills to do so. Her opinions are sought and respected, and her influence on national attitudes, programs, and practices, on American home and family life, as well as on social and economic conditions generally, is a potent one.

While woman points with pride, and justly so, to her position of dignity and influence today, she is not unmindful that this position was hard won; that it was not conferred upon her merely through the good graces of change.

She knows that each forward step has been taken over a rough and rocky obstacle course. She knows, also, that preceding her was another woman whose vision, courage, and determination enabled her to carry the lighted lamp and level the rugged ground. It seems appropriate, as we observe the 80th Anniversary of the founding of the National Council of Women of the United States, and also the International Council of Women, that we look back a moment at the road that has been traveled and at the woman of yesterday whose efforts brought us to this triumphant day of achievement. It is appropriate inasmuch as one of the avowed purposes of the Councils was to unite, as a body of women, to "devise new and effective methods of securing equality and justice for woman." In the early part of the 19th Century, a woman's world, in large measure, was her home and her church with, perhaps, a few humanitarian services extended to her immediate community. Life for the average woman was hard, and many shackles bound her in the development of her talents and in the exercise of her abilities, as well as in the exercise of her God-ordained free agency. There were rigid barriers of law against property holding and guardianship of children. Most industries refused to employ her and those which did employ her, offered only routine labor with long hours and low pay. The taboos of society on education and public expression, along with the prevalent superstition which held, "the weak, feminine brain, incapable of serious thinking..." shackled her personal development. The advantages of education were extremely limited. Colleges of higher learning did not admit her. The political privileges of woman were nil. There had been sporadic women's clubs of a sort—neighbors meeting together for sociability and the exercise of their minds—with some groups working in a haphazard fashion for the public good. These clubs were poorly organized, however, and affairs were largely controlled by husbands of the members. The National Council of Women In 1833, a few bold women formed the first woman's club with a political purpose—the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society. The furor which this aroused is described in the book, Angels and Amazons, issued by the National Council of Women of the United States, in 1935. It states that the woman who identified herself with this group was regarded as bold and unwise indeed, for a respectable woman did not speak in public, nor did she organize in behalf of any political cause. At the first convention held by this group, a mob roared outside the meeting place, and following the meeting the building was burned. Woman was not to be deterred, however, in her efforts for emancipation. Early in 1848, Elizabeth Cady Stanton joined with Lucretia Mott, Martha C. Wright, and Mary Ann McClintock in calling what is regarded as the first Women's Rights Convention. It was held July 19, 1848, in the little Wesleyan Chapel at Seneca Falls, New York. In the book, Angels and Amazons, we read that the word "convention," as a term for this meeting, "expressed hope rather than fulfillment." It was practically a small assembly of neighbors. It thrashed out, however, the first public "Declaration of Independence for Woman," with which most of you are familiar. This "Declaration" was the offspring of the pen of Mrs. Stanton who, in reality, was the chief agent in calling the convention. Forty years later came that highly significant event—a convention convened March 25, 1888, in Alboughs Opera House in Washington, D.C., to observe the 40th Anniversary of the first public declaration of women's rights. The convention was called by the National Woman's Suffrage Association with two giants of the early suffrage movement—Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony—as the key figures. Their primary purpose in calling the convention was to further the cause of woman's suffrage. So strong were the convictions of Mrs. Stanton on the importance of woman's suffrage, that, according to one of her biographers, Theodore Tilton, "... She would willingly give her body to be burned for the sake of seeing her sex enfranchised." While Susan B. Anthony, according to one of her biographers, Ida H. Harper, "stood ready to sink all personal feelings... For the sake of promoting this cause which she placed above all else in the world." It was a day of rejoicing for these two great advocates of woman's rights when Frederick Douglass, a respected and influential community leader of the day, who had been invited to speak at the convention, wrote: "The cause of woman's suffrage has under it a truth as eternal as the universe of thought, and must triumph if this planet endures." Invitations to the 1888 Washington convention were issued to seventy-seven women's organizations selected as being of either national scope or of national value. Of this number, fifty-three accepted. In addition to the delegates from the United States, there were representatives from England, France, Norway, Denmark, Finland, India, and Canada. Eighty speakers addressed the convention. The central figure proved to be: Susan B. Anthony. In her black dress and pretty red silk shawl with her gray-brown hair smoothly combed over a regal head, she was every inch a stateswoman. In addressing a meeting preliminary to the convention, Susan B. Anthony, with all the earnestness of her strong nature and in a voice vibrating with emotion, set forth far-sighted views. With regard to the platform—views which maintain today in the National Council of Women—said Mrs. Anthony, "We have now come to another turning point and, if it is necessary, I will fight forty years more to make our platform for the Christian to stand upon. Whether she be a Catholic who counts her beads or a Protestant of the strictest Orthodox creed... These are the principles I want to maintain: that our platform may be kept as broad as the universe; that upon it may stand the representatives of all creeds and of no creeds—Jew or Christian, Protestant or Catholic, Gentile or Mormon, Pagan or Atheist." (It may be of interest to you who know the price of your seat at a table today, to learn that, for the opening session of the 1888 Washington convention, 25c was charged, with 50c for seats in the reserved section.) In the book entitled, The Life and Work of Susan B. Anthony,

Anthony, by Ida Husted Harper, published in 1898, the Washington convention is referred to as "the greatest women's convention ever held." Certainly, we must concede that this convention remains among the greatest women's conventions ever held as we contemplate that it was utilized as the springboard for the formation of the National Council of Women of the United States and the International Council of Women, whose continuing influences over a period of eighty years have reached into hamlet and city, touched for good the lives of people of many nations and all races, helped win for woman in our own beloved Nation the right of suffrage through the adoption of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution in 1920; helped women in other nations toward suffrage; helped open for women doors of opportunity and service; effectively contributed toward lifting women to a position of dignity, trust, and responsibility in community life and world affairs; and perhaps most important of all, helped women realize their own potential as thinking, feeling, producing, and contributing human beings in a world where such is sorely needed. So today we pay tribute to those stalwart women who launched the so-called "women's movement"; we honor those who called the 1888 convention; we revere those whose foresight and genius conceived the Councils of Women and set the sails that bade them where to go: Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, Lucy Stone, the Grimke sisters, Frances Willard, Clara Barton, and others of immortal memory. We pay tribute to those other women of lesser prominence who caught the vision, played well their respective parts in the founding of the Councils, and in the advancement of the cause of woman. Without them the convention could have failed in its purposes. These were the delegates who came, who listened, who were convinced, and who went forth to act in their respective spheres of influence. They, too, were women of stature—enlightened, courageous, tireless in their dedication to the cause they espoused. One such woman was Emily S. Tanner Richards, the official delegate to the convention from the organization which I represent today. May I present a brief word picture of Mrs. Richards, with the hope that in so doing, you may also see the other delegates, how they worked, and the magnitude of their contribution.

The National Council of Women
Mrs. Richards' place of residence was in Salt Lake City in the heart of the Rocky Mountains. By nature she loved freedom and by environment she enjoyed it. Her husband was an attorney whose affairs took him often to Washington D.C. Mrs. Richards usually accompanied him. While in Washington, she had rare opportunities to be instructed and inspired by the great suffrage leaders. These influences, together with the teachings of her Church, which accepts free agency as a God-given right, and which at the time of its founding granted woman the religious vote, made of her a strong advocate of the rights of women and a consistent believer in the obligations that accompany these rights. Her supporting voice was clearly lifted at the Washington convention.

Upon her return home, she was appointed by the National Suffrage Association as chief organizer for Utah. With intelligence and courage, she led this organization, rallying to her many prominent and capable women dedicated to the cause of national suffrage. With conviction as to the place of women in public service, she organized women's charity societies, establishing in that early day a child placing service. She organized a political education society known as the Utah State Council of Women. There then came into being the organization of The League of Woman Voters to which she lent her great administrative strengths. She won appointments to school and library boards, and helped other women of competence to do so as well. She influenced legislation. Step by step, she and her associates established in community leaders a confidence in the ability of women to take their place at the side of men, at length receiving responsible assignments and special honors from Utah's Governors. Thus did Mrs. Richards advance the so-called Women's Movement in Utah.

Similarly, it was advanced throughout the width and breadth of the land by other delegates to the Washington convention. Today we also pay tribute to the National Council of Women of the United States and to the International Council, which for eighty years have consistently made their organized contributions to the achievements of women. We honor them for the way in which they have held to the original concept of an aggregation of organizations extending their influence and power by uniting as a single body on matters of common concern. We respect them for their integrity with regard to suffrage, and for their readiness to lend their influence in its behalf wherever it has been denied to women. We admire them for their achievements and for their continuing concern for human well-being.

True, new interests and activities engage the Councils as times and needs change, but throughout the years they have held firm to a body of principles which was patterned by Elizabeth Cady Stanton who penned the first "Woman's Declaration of Independence": good home and family life, proper care of children, temperance, women's suffrage, and the widening of women's sphere, indignation against all forms of oppression, love of liberty and love of justice, respect for human rights and human dignity.

Just as the beginning years of the woman's movement claimed great and enlightened women leaders, so have the advancing years. We pay tribute today to such brilliant and distinguished women as May Wright Sewell, Dr. Anna Garland Spencer, Mary McLeod Bethune, Eleanor Roosevelt, to mention but a few. Nor do we lose sight of the dedicated leaders among us today who generously devote their time, energies, talents, and means to the great purposes of the Council. We pay special tribute to our present dynamic and capable president, Mrs. Mildred A. Robbins.

In a day referred to by the columnist as woman's triumphant day of achievement, let us rejoice in the accomplishments of the past and the good of the present, and let us look with clear vision toward the future. None would deny that we are living in a day of turmoil, upheaval, and confusion; and that the action of today will leave its mark on the world of tomorrow. Let us then remind ourselves that the struggles and sacrifices that have brought women to their present position of influence and power require that they shall use these strengths to dissipate hate and prejudice, allay fear, promote understanding; that they shall stand firm for respect for law and order; that they shall intelligently exercise their hard-won rights of suffrage in obtaining ever-improved laws and honorable and worthy government; that they shall engage in intelligent and well-directed action that effectively will contribute toward building a better world. Today our focus must be on our responsibilities rather than on our rights. Power is in our hands. How best to use that power is the challenge before us.

Can we not meet this challenge with the same degree of success that the women of the past met the challenges of their day? Can we not do so with confidence, working unitedly under the aegis of the National Council of Women which for eighty years has performed with integrity and honor? I believe we can.

MONUMENT VALLEY by Josef Muench

The woman's days are patterned as the sand
Where wind has blown.
From dawn's first coral to the evening's deep
Vermilion tone,
She weaves a weft of footsteps on the land
Behind her flock.
Where sun has made a moving warp of shade
From standing rock.
She sees the night, the lightning's jagged thrust
In black and white,
And steps around the cacti bush whose blooms
Are flaming bright.
In burning summer sun or hogan's dusk
Of winter gloom,
She deftly weaves the pattern of her days
Upon her loom.

"Alice Morrey," Bailey 491

"7. 'ee ', - f ), ue ay Tialatate we"
That morning I was at the kitchen table writing to my folks, when my husband banged in through the back door.
"Guess Ill begin plowing that west forty this morning," he announced.
"Yeah?" I managed vaguely, without looking up.
"Be time to plant now before I'm ready."
He stood there waiting for me, I knew, to show interest in the west forty, but I went right on with my letter.

"... It seems like six years, instead of six months, since we moved out here. Sometimes I'm so lonely I could plain die."

The back door opened and closed.
Ron had gone to his plowing.
Quickly, I pushed away from the table, went to the window.
He was standing at the back gate, looking at the west forty.
What a handsome man he was, tall and strong, the active, out-of-doors type. He belonged here in Wyoming, on the land.
I was selfish to expect him to spend his life back home in an office, at a desk.
I wanted to go to him, to crook my arm through his and walk with him to the barn.
Instead, I turned away, went into the living room, stood in front of Aunt Elly's mirror.

From our home in Massachusetts, we had brought to Wyoming only two pieces of furniture, my piano and Aunt Elly's mirror. Because she had no daughters of her own, Aunt Elly had given the mirror to me.
I loved it and had insisted on bringing it to our new home, although reaching from the floor almost to the ceiling and filling the entire space between the fireplace and the west wall, it looked entirely out of place in our little house, too big and too elegant.

I swung through my exercises in front of it, along with the teacher on television. I danced, pretending I was back home with partners lined up waiting for me, clutching a pillow to my body.
In Aunt Elly's mirror I could see my books on the shelves Ron had built for them, and, of course, my piano.

What if we were ten miles from Rincon, the nearest town? And five miles from a neighbor?
Could be I wouldn't have too much in common with the people out here if I did know them.
And, goodness knows, I had plenty to keep me busy right here in my own little house.
Right now I must finish my letter, then bake a cake, then, I decided, I'd put up a picnic lunch and eat with Ron down at the west forty under those trees along the river; make up to him for this morning.

With a final look into the mirror, I went to the kitchen, sat again at the table, and went on with my letter.

The next Friday, when, as usual, we went to Rincon for supplies, I had an airmail reply.
Trudy's wedding date was set for early in June.
"After all," Mother wrote, "she's the only sister you have. She'd be brokenhearted if you were not here for her wedding."

After dinner that night, when Ron was settled by the fire, his long legs stretched out to the blazing logs, I perched myself on the arm of his chair.
"Could we go to Massachusetts for Trudy's wedding?" I begged.
"I can't," he said without a minute's hesitation.
"I'm way behind with my work now. But there's no reason why you can't go. I'll take you to the plane in Cheyenne any day you say."
Then he reached for his paper.
"Well!" I exploded, bouncing up from his chair.
"I guess you wouldn't even miss me around here!"

Ron pulled me down onto his lap.
"Of course, I'd miss you. How silly can you be? But you can't let Trudy down. When do you want to start?"

Back home, the wedding was followed by two weeks of family dinners, parties, dances.
Then one night I knew I had to see my husband.
When I told my family at breakfast I was going home the next day, if I could get a reservation on the plane, my mother said,
"But how can you? Ron wouldn't know to meet you in Cheyenne."
But I had figured that out in the night.
"Tomorrow is Friday. Ron never fails to go to Rincon on Friday for supplies," I explained.
"I'll wire Mr. Gross, at the store there. He'll tell Ron."

In Cheyenne, Ron was waiting at the plane.
In Rincon, when we left the store we passed the little white church.
I'd gone there a few times and the people had been friendly enough, but it wasn't like church back home.
I hadn't been for weeks now.

When we were almost home, Ron glanced across at me with that secretive, boyish look on his weather-brown face.
"I have a surprise for you," he said.
Had he put up the extra pantry shelves I'd been asking for?
"What is it?"
"You'll see when we get home."

We went in at the back door.
In the kitchen window, between the ruffly white curtains, my red geranium was in bloom.
How wonderful to be in my own house again!
"Come in here," Ron called from the living room.
From the doorway I expected to see myself as usual in Aunt Elly's mirror on the opposite wall.
Instead, the whole out-of-doors looked in at me; the side yard, the white picket fence, the trees, the plowed fields, even the mountains beyond.

"Like it?" Ron asked, smoothing his big hand along the unpainted casing of the new window.
"It's not quite finished. I did it at night. I had to hurry. But see how much lighter it makes this room?"
Crossed to the new window and stood beside my husband.
Two children were coming toward us, along the edge of the plowed field.
"They're the Gilligan children," Ron said.
"They come this way from their school bus."
"Who are the Gilligan children?"
"They've moved into that place down by the river. One day while you were gone the man came over to where I was plowing. Seems like a nice person."

Look up the canyon to your left. See that little white house on the side of the mountain?" "Yes." "Gilligan says a family lives up there, too, and that some people have moved in down the river from his place. He wondered whether we neighbors could get together—have a pot luck—get acquainted." He glanced toward my piano. "If they met here, we could have singing and maybe dance." Now the Gilligan children were passing our house. They saw us at the window and waved back to us. "Why couldn't we have a Sunday School here for the children," Ron went on, "since we 494 have the piano? You taught in the Sunday School back home." I went into the bedroom to take off my coat. In the excitement of the new window, after that first realization that it was missing, I had forgotten Aunt Elly's mirror, had forgotten to ask what had become of it. But there it was, flat against the wall at the foot of our bed, only the upper half of it visible. For one instant I resented Ron's having poked it off here in the bedroom. How would Aunt Elly like that? And how could I live without my mirror? How could I see myself from head to toe without it? Then I knew Ron was right to cut the window in the side of our house. Instead of seeing reflections in Aunt Elly's mirror, my books, my piano, my own selfish way of life, I could look out now and see the trees, the meadows, even the mountain—a world I had scarcely known was there. Now I could watch for the Gilligan children coming from school. I could look up the canyon and see the little white house on the side of the mountain. Ron stood in the bedroom doorway. "How would you like to go over to Gilligans' this evening?" "Let's, Ron. We can talk to them about the neighborhood party, and about the Sunday School." Ron came to me, put his strong arm around me. "You don't really care about my taking the mirror from the living room, do you? There was no other way." "Care, Ron? I am deeply grateful." Woman's Ramona W.

Aldous Preparing for the Later Years All one's earlier life is preparation for later years, but how different is the contemplation of later years in the bloom of youth and the realization when the later years are reached! To the young it seems unthinkable that the problems of later life would test and try one, sometimes almost to the breaking point. When one has lived to later life, it would appear that one has acquired wisdom and overcome temptations for so long that the way would be easy. One finds, however, that each age presents problems, and that they do not grow less as the years advance. Change is the essence of life at all ages today. No longer can one count on living out his life at the place of his birth. It does not even present itself as desirable to many people. Physical and environmental changes are inevitable for many families whose husbands are in industry, which makes a practice of moving its employees to different locations. When young, such changes are considered normal, as a means to progress and greater financial return. The selling and buying of homes (usually to a more desirable one) is a change which is welcomed as the family grows. Finally, the time is reached, however, which presents the other side of the coin, with an opposite phenomenon.

Instead of an enlarging world of responsibility, one's responsibilities begin to shrink and continue to do so until all the children are married. A couple is left alone to face life together, then, as they started out many years before. A wife is then approaching, or is in her later years, and, in surveying her future, she may question whether or not she has made proper preparation for the years ahead. She also faces the possibility of being left alone and losing her dearest companion. A change of residence, then, is not a joyous occasion as in earlier years. It is usually a move from a large, beloved home, made dear by cherished memories of children and teen-age activities, to a smaller home or apartment.

Just what is the preparation needed to fortify a woman in later years? Basically, it is the growth and strengthening of her testimony which will give her the needed support. Her knowledge and obedience to the gospel principles and acknowledging the hand of the Lord in all the vicissitudes that may come to her, are the main supports on which she will lean to sustain her. Continuing service in the Church will bring continuing satisfaction and joy, and although a woman may be far from her loved ones, Relief Society will offer her the love and understanding of many sisters in the gospel. She may fill lonely hours with good works. Where a temple is nearby, she may perform saving ordinances for her progenitors, but where there is no temple, still she may search out her ancestors. This is a rewarding work.

If a woman, on the other hand, has frittered away her time, as her children grew older, on pleasures of no enduring worth, those pleasures will continue to be the avenues to which she will turn for enjoyment. She may, under these circumstances, however, miss the tranquil joy of contentment in the knowledge that she is about her Father's business. She has not prepared for the greatest return.

The storms beat upon every woman as a part of the testing and probationary period of this life. Blessed and safe is she who has built her house on the rock of love of the Lord. He tells every woman "If ye love me, keep my commandments." (John 14:15.) As a woman keeps his commandments, added strength comes to her. As she obeys his word "Search the scriptures," she may be rescued from despondency and despair. She will rest in the love and peace the Savior promised the righteous in her later years.

The Song of the Hills
Helen Mrovka

There were many sounds in the song of the hills. There was the murmuring of the brook that flowed gently past the old house that stood on the hilltop. There were the wind sounds which whistled through the rafters, and rattled the window panes, and the raindrops which pattered on the roof, the rustling of wild pigeons as they flew over the canyon, the eerie howl of the coyote that was heard in the hills after dark, or of a lion roaring on the mountain top. There was the tinkle of cowbells as the cows came up through the pasture at sunset to be milked and fed, and the men's footsteps as they came in with the milk to be put away. There was the gentle voice of the mother, as she called to the children to come in to the evening meal or to do a chore. There was the crowing of the old black rooster at the break of day, and the clucking of hens in the barnyard, sounding like little old ladies at a sewing bee. The hoot of the owl in the old oak tree, and the harsh calling of crows to each other in the old fruit orchard were heard. There was the music of violin and guitar, that was played at the Saturday night dances in the old schoolhouse.

There were these and many more sounds, but now the song is ended, and only the melody lingers on in the music of the hills.

THE MAKER OF HILLS
I look to the hills—dear hills of home— Untouched by winter's frigid blasts, Ageless, steadfast, they give me strength; Summer's lightning and crashing thunder, Bulwarks of majestic splendor, Serenely they triumph, keeping vigil; impressively stretched the valley's length. Their constancy dissolves my fears away. As dusk envelops my universe, They hover protectingly near and strong; whisper. A plea to the Maker of hills— Extend thy peace, and thy love prolong.

The sign at the side of the road read: "Welcome to Danville — Pop. 8,527." Madge Hilliard sighed. The trip was almost finished. She had been on the road for four and a half hours, and she was feeling the effects of driving a far greater distance than she was accustomed to. Not only was she not used to driving for such a long time, but the trip had been anything but pleasant for her.

"And it's sure to get worse," she told herself as she turned the car off the main highway toward the older, well-established residential area of the town. The entire four and a half hours had been a turmoil of doubt and indecision. As a result, Madge was feeling tense and nervous as well as the driving fatigue.

She had gone over and over in her mind the events leading up to this trip to Danville, and although she was still unwilling to change her original decision, she could not reconcile her mind and conscience to the fact that it was the thing she should do. Perhaps Lyle's attitude contributed to her chaotic state of thought. Not that he was against her insistence not to move, but more that she knew he wanted to move.

She remembered again their conversation as he walked her out to the car. "Well," he had asked, "what are you going to say to them?" "Really Lyle," she had replied, "don't you think it's time they stopped running my life?" "What is that supposed to mean?" he asked, looking as if he would like to penetrate her mind and find the answer for himself. "Oh, nothing, I guess," she faltered, "I... I just resent the way they put it in the letter... almost as if I were a pawn for them to move about as they wish." He laughed then, a rich, full-bodied laugh that made his eyes crinkle at the corners, and made her lips draw into a tight line. "Come now, honey. Aren't you being a bit melodramatic? I mean, after all, your mother will need a professional nurse, and the town has needed another good doctor since your father died. You are a nurse, and I like to think I'm a good doctor. Besides, you know I've always wanted to practice in a small town." "Humph!" was what she would say. "Well," he finished as he gave her a parting kiss, "do whatever you think best, dear.

Just don't say anything you'll be sorry for later." All Madge. As she pulled out of the driveway and started on her way, Madge kept hearing Lyle's words echo in her mind, "I've always wanted to practice in a small town." "That's just it!" she retorted to herself. "I don't want to get smothered in a small town again. I grew up in Danville. I know what it's like. Everyone knowing everyone else's business. No one ever really having any private thoughts or being able to do anything without someone or everyone knowing about it." And when it comes to making a decision! Well, everyone has an opinion, and no one hesitates to let you know what should be done. No thanks," she said to herself, "I'll take the anonymity of a big city. Thank you, but I prefer to live my own life." 500 She wouldn't have said that to Lyle, though he, too, was reared in a small town. He had nothing but praise and adulation for small town living, however. Even before he finished his internship, he had talked of moving to a small town to practice. Madge had never openly opposed the idea, but she had been very conscientious about making sure things didn't work out that way for them. Madge had worked for several years at the Lakeside General Hospital and knew many of the older, well-established doctors. When she learned of one who was looking for a young doctor to form a partnership with him, she immediately recommended that he ask Dr. Lyle Hillard. Lyle, just finished with his internship and looking for a place to practice, was grateful and appreciative for the chance to start out in such a good position. He was a good doctor, and the older doctor was well pleased with his work, so the Hilliards prospered. Madge was perfectly content with her life. She had quit nursing to become a fulltime mother to their three children. She was active and busy in church work, with civic volunteer work, and PTA. For the first time in her life she felt she was a person of individual worth and accomplishment. Then came Carol's letter. Dear Madge and Lyle: We realize we should have phoned you again, but after our first assessment of the situation, we decided to write instead. Mother's stroke was rather serious and she will need to be in the hospital for some time. Even after she comes home, she will need much professional care and personal attention. We gathered together in sort of an old family council and decided the most desirable arrangement would be for you and Lyle to move to Danville. We realize this sounds bossy, but we know that Lyle has wanted to practice in a small town, and Danville surely could use more good doctors. You could move into the old house. It's always been such a nice, roomy place. Mom and Dad reared five children there and had room for Grandma. Besides, we would all help out, of course, but Mom will need the kind of professional care that you can give, Madge. We thought of hiring a nurse, but felt that she wouldn't be as dedicated and concerned about Mother's wellbeing as you would be. Then, too, there's Grandmother. She's not really a problem, but she would surely resent a stranger moving into the house.... Barna so it had gone, on and on, very persuasively outlining the details and suggesting possible problems with their logical solutions, and so on. All that remained for Lyle and Madge, in their interpretation, was to give notice, sell their house, pack, and move to Danville. Lyle had seemed almost eager to go, but Madge had balked. In fact, Madge had rebelled. "I won't do it!" She had stormed. "They can't make me! What right have they even to suggest such a thing!" She had thrown the letter down and stamped out of the room. Lyle had retrieved the letter and sat quietly rereading it as he waited for her anger to calm. "What right have they...?" Madge asked herself angrily. "They have always done that, and now they are trying to do it again. Well, it won't work now. I'm not a little girl now... Trying to choose between chocolate or strawberry ice cream, or picking which dress to wear on the first day of school." For many years Madge had felt that her older brothers and sisters were running her life. At first, she had conceded that was her burden for being the youngest. As a child, she had basked in the attention and petting received from four older children, but the time had come when she began to feel constricted by their attention. It seemed one or the other of them was always saying what she should or shouldn't do. When a major problem in the family came up, a family council was called and everyone had a chance to express his opinion and vote on the final solution. Madge's face still burned with the memory of the older children's scornful laughter when she had expressed her opinion on several occasions. She soon learned not to say anything even though Father made a point of asking what she thought. Usually, she would just duck her head and mumble something about not caring what was done. Madge had idolized her father. He was the town's most respected doctor, and Madge could not imagine a kinder, more gentle person. She had even dreamed of following in his footsteps and becoming a doctor. When he died, suddenly, of a heart attack, a family council had been called. The older children were now married, but they congregated quickly in the kitchen of the old house. Madge was a senior in high school, and she would never forget that particular council. They discussed what should be done with this belonging, what should happen to that piece of equipment, what should be done about the financial state of the widow and child still at home. Medical school was ruled out. There would not be enough money. Instead, Madge could enter the medical profession as a nurse. The training would not take as long, nor be so costly. It had all been taken care of with precision and dispatch. The family had decided the course of her life, and she had just sat there stunned and silent. But she had not forgotten. She had gone to nursing school. She had become a nurse and gone to a large city to work. There she had met a young student doctor, Lyle Hillard. They had married and Madge had begun to climb out from the cocoon of being the pampered and petted little sister. And now, here they were, trying to get her back under their influence. Not willing that she should live her life herself, here they were making decisions for her again. Well, she just wouldn't do it. Now that her anger had cooled somewhat, she went back into the living room and told Lyle her decision. "I don't know why it upsets you so much," he had said.

"It sounded pretty reasonable to me." "T don't expect you to understand. Just let it be that I don't want to move back to Danville. Okay? I just don't want to. I'm happy here and that's that. I'll go and help out at first. I'll arrange for a nurse and do whatever I can, but I'm not going to move back and that is final!" 502 Lyle had shrugged and said, "I guess it's up to you, honey. After all, it's your mother and your family." Now Mother was ready to come home from the hospital and Madge was driving to Danville to help. She had not answered Carol's letter any more than to call and tell them she was coming, and that she wanted to meet them all together that evening. She planned to tell them of her decision then. Mother wouldn't be home until tomorrow, and she would have time to rest and set the house in order this afternoon before facing the family.

Ma ade stepped from the heat of the sultry summer day into the coolness of the old house. She had almost forgotten about Grandma and had been slightly startled to find the house so cool and comfortable. Grandma still lived with Mother in the big rambling house where her family and her son's family had been reared. She had a small apartment of rooms on the second floor, although she had always been given free run of the house. She preferred her own rooms and often received friends and visitors in them instead of using the family living room.

"Ts that you, Majesty?" Grandma's old wrinkled face peered over the balustrade of the second floor balcony. Madge smiled at the nickname. Only Grandma and Father had called her that. Everyone else thought it too pretentious sounding. "Yes, Grandma," she answered. "Well, come on up and see me!"' It was together an order and an invitation, and Madge found herself almost bounding up the stairs as she had often done as a child. She reached the old woman as Grandma was about to enter her small apartment. Madge slipped her arms around Grandma's shoulders and gave her a quick hug.

"Oh, Grandma," she said, as tears gathered in her eyes, "it's so good to see you." "Tut, tut!" replied Grandma turning away from the hug and entering her sitting room. "Come in and talk awhile. I hear they asked you and Lyle to move here and take care of your mother. Don't remember hearing if you said you would, though."

That was typical of Grandma. Right to the point, without wasting breath on any small talk.

" Well, what kind of a greeting is that?" Madge asked, parrying for time.

"What kind of an answer is that?" Grandma glanced sharply at Madge, "Never mind. Sit down. Tell me what you've been up to lately. How are Lyle and the children?"

They chatted for awhile about life in the city, but Madge knew it would not be long before Grandma would get back to her original question.

"Well, what are you going to do? Move back or assert yourself and refuse to be bossed around?" Grandma asked suddenly.

"Why, Grandma," Madge stammered, completely taken by surprise. "I don't know what you mean."

"Oh, fiddlesticks, Madge! Of course you do. I've sat down in that kitchen often enough to know what goes on in those family councils. I've seen the hair on the back of your neck rise often enough that I know what goes on inside your mind, even if you never have had the courage to say anything."

Madge could only stare. She couldn't think of anything to say.

" Tm right, am I not?" Grandma demanded, then went on without waiting for an answer, "I can just see your face when you got the letter. I'll bet it made you real angry." Grandma chuckled. "I'd like to see you react like that in front of them just once. You've always been such a jelly-fish. Well, I see you've grown some. I can see it in your eyes; in the way you walk and move; in the way you hold your head. I rather imagine you're going to let them have it this time."

Madge found her voice enough to stammer, "I was planning to tell them it was impossible... I mean, we just can't move back." "You mean you won't move back. I bet Lyle would jump at the chance," Grandma gazed out the window. "More's the pity you had to get your backbone now."

" T don't understand. I thought you said you'd be happy to see me stand up to them?" Madge was completely puzzled by the old woman's frankness. Grandma had never talked to her like this before.

"T admit I'd like to see you stand on your own feet, but your mother needs you now. I'm 503 July 1968 an old woman, and I can't do much except get myself from here to there and back again. I'm not much at cooking and cleaning, and I wouldn't be worth a hoot at taking care of her."

"But we can hire someone...." "Hire..." Grandma scoffed. "Your mother needs you, not some impersonal hired woman who will come hustling and bustling in and out and want to turn everything upside-down and even backwards."

"Then you think we should move here?" asked Madge beginning to get angry.

"No. I just think you should do what's right." "What do you mean?"

"First you say I should stand up to my family, say what I think. Then you say Mother needs me. Then you say we shouldn't move here...."

"You didn't say we shouldn't move here. I just said that I thought you should do what is right."

"You're certainly not making any sense." Madge found her anger rising, despite her wish to remain calm. The whole conversation was queer. Madge began to wish she had gone to her room to rest instead of coming here to talk with Grandma.

" T always thought I did what was right, Grandma. When haven't I done what was right? What have I done that is so wrong?"

"Oh, yes, Majesty. You've always done the right things. But why? Stop and think. Hasn't it always been to gain approval, or because you were afraid of what would happen if you did wrong? Isn't that why you've always let others make your decisions for you? Oh, yes. You've always done right, but think! It may have been for the wrong reason."

"Now you have lost me! Completely!" Madge stood up angrily. "I'll go now." "Wait, I'm sorry, Majesty. I guess I've been a bit hard on you. I'll try to be more clear. I'm sure you've had a fight with your conscience over this, too. Wanting to do right and still live your own life. I don't want to impose my will on you any more than I want your family to impose theirs. You have to want to do it to make it right."

If it's what you want to do, then it's your life and your decision." "Now, Majesty," she hesitated, "read I Corinthians, 13. Paul says it better than I could." "T... I don't know, Grandma. I'm tired, I guess. I think Id better go rest." Madge turned from the room and walked slowly to her own room. Someone had fixed it up for her arrival. It smelled fresh and clean, and the bed looked smooth and inviting. She lay down and closed her eyes, but she could not sleep. Her conversation with Grandma kept running through her mind. "Read I Corinthians, 13... Paul says it better...". Says what better? Madge sat up suddenly and reached for the Bible on the bedside table. She thumbed through the pages quickly and began to read: Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity. Charity! The pure love of Christ. Charity that is not vain or puffed up; that suffers long and is kind; that thinketh no evil, but endureth all things. Charity! That was it. That was what was missing in her life. Madge could see it now. All these years she had been feeling sorry for herself; feeling her family ran her life and smothered her efforts to be an individual. All these years she had been at fault. She had not developed the spirit of charity and love for others. She had just been concerned with her own wants and desires. What was it Grandma had said? "You do the right things to gain approval or to escape punishment. Those aren't the right reasons for doing good." Madge rose and walked to the window. What would be so hard about moving here? Grandma was right. If it was what she wanted to do, it would be her decision and her life. In her heart, she knew it was the right thing to do. Her mother needed her. It was what Lyle would want, too. Actually, wasn't she doing to Lyle what she had accused her family of doing to her; forcing her will on him? Hadn't he wanted to practice in a small town all his life? It was her forcing him to stay in the city because she wanted to. All the time she had been selfishly thinking only of herself. "Well," Madge told herself firmly, "I can't think of any reason why I have to go on living this way. I can change, and I will. The first thing I'm going to do is call Lyle and tell him I've decided to move to Danville." She laid the Bible back on the table and stepped toward the door. As she walked from the room, she felt a peace inside. That she had not known for a long, long time. It was like embarking on a great new adventure.

Over the marsh the loon's lost, lonesome calling
Echoes across the lake's quiescent face.
Nostalgically thoughts drift to shadows falling
From sedge and cattails mixed with Queen Ann's lace.
The air is hushed and drowsy with its sentience,
Sun glistens on the pond, then scatters sparks,
As fish jump, sending spray of drops cascading.
A drake wings leisurely. A meadowlark's
Sweet trill awakes the hush.
The shadows deepen
And cooling zephyrs lull the marsh to sleep.
Again that loon's sad call blends with the landscape
Making haunting memories to keep.

An adventure in love.

Let your children be happy. Laugh with them, never at them. Good humor is kind, never bitter or sarcastic. Laughter is infectious. Let your children do some giving. Try not to do all the giving yourself. It is more blessed to give than to receive. Blessings will spread.

Let your children know that you love them and that you accept them as they are. You may not accept some of their actions, but you will accept and love them always. Love is contagious.

Let your children do something. They may not do that something as well as you can do it, but some day, by persistent doing, they may do it better than you. Success is communicable.

Let your children respect you. They will when you are the kind of person they can respect. Respect is catching.

Let me remember, let me gather love-brimmed thoughts
Culled from the shining of companioned years,
Small incidents to be blue-bright forget-me-nots
To light my lonely dark of unshed tears.
Our understanding forms a bond, a lasting tie,
Infrangible, which time cannot destroy.
You live still in the thoughts which diamond-stud
My sky with stars full quintupled with pain as well as joy.
For I have learned that each star has jagged points,
Sharp and ancipital to pierce my calm,
But also, I have learned each passing year anoints
The painful wound with time's hurt-healing balm.
Each star has dagger points times five, and yet
Let me remember—let me not forget!

"Willard Luce"

Memory returning was like fragrance: pine needles in the dawn; apple blossoms after sudden rain; lilacs, evening sweet. It was like color seen for the first time in rainbow spectrums; in sunset's orange, its pink, mauve, and yellow; like green against day's sky.

And it was like music, melodious and kind; filled with new peace, with wild, young rapture; lifted anticipation, filled with all of knowing. It was joy and pain, ecstasy and sorrowing, this silken moment of memory returning.

When I had an opportunity to tell the cake baker how much joy she had brought to me and to so many others by this lovely cake to the little girl, she smiled. And said: "Then I am well repaid for the time spent in shaping and decorating the butterfly." She grew silent in reflection and then added, "And I have helped fulfill a long-standing promise made when I myself was a little girl." The cake was a memorial to a very special spiritual experience.

The Lady Who Bakes Cakes

She said when she was small she had encountered a severe illness, and time had hung heavy on her hands in recuperation. She grew discouraged and fretful, for her family was busy at other tasks, and could not spend all their time at her bedside, and she grew lonely. One day a neighbor knocked at the door and said she had a cake for a little sick girl. The entire cake was intended for the little girl trying so hard to get well, the neighbor said. The sick child could do with it as she pleased, but perhaps she would want to share it with her family.

My friend recalled that it had been just a simple, plain white loaf cake. "In those days people didn't decorate cakes as lavishly as we do now. Indeed, we didn't have all the coloring and special candies to make cakes pretty that you find in almost every market or corner grocery store in these days. But this freshly baked cake seemed to me the most beautiful cake in the world because it was all my very own." Lying in bed and looking at the edge on the window sill, she began to think of how others had tried to tempt her to eat, and now she wanted to share with them what she had to give. "As I began to think about others, even offering them a piece of cake, I began to get stronger. Soon I was up and around the room, and then well enough to go outside to play, and return to school."

Later, when she had tried to thank the woman who had baked the cake, this wise neighbor had said, "Some day you must bake a cake for some other little sick girl, and pass along your joy in this cake." Now, many years later, a butterfly cake had cheered my young friend. The original recipient had never forgotten the incident, and now she has a happy reputation as "the lady who bakes cakes." People love to know that she is to be on the refreshment committee for club or church, for it may mean that there is a special cake to be used as a centerpiece.

There may be a club or church party when one of the prizes is a cake shaped like a lamb encircled by a candy fence. Or fresh violets and tiny pink rosebuds may have been dipped in egg white and sugar before being placed on frosting peaks to produce a cake with a fresh, colorful nosegay. The original gift of the woman who helped a little girl has blossomed into many dozens of cakes across the changing years.

Moments of happiness from the gifts of cakes have lightened the loneliness and sorrow in the loss of loved ones, and have given encouragement and comfort to the ill and the homebound. The cake baking has become a rewarding hobby, leading to rich fellowship and new friendships. It is a hobby open to all women, young and old, rich and poor, especially in this age of easy-to-prepare cake mixes. The necessary ingredient is the wish to think of others and make them happy.

Are you lonely and bored or unhappy today? Then maybe you should go into your kitchen and bake a cake for someone to enjoy.

The original recipient had made over 1,000 members in the Relief Society, and has served in many positions in the various auxiliaries as well. She is the mother of three children and is eighty-two years old.

It was just by chance that we saw the valley. I can't bear to think we might have missed it. My two sons and I should have taken the road going north, but we went west instead, through the little town and slowly climbed a hill for many miles out of our way. It was soon after we realized we were on the wrong road, and had started back that we came to a turn and, suddenly, below us was the valley! Gold and green and brown fields were in almost perfect squares, with blue heavens above, and the rays of the setting sun making a gauze screen through which we viewed the picture. My eighteen-year-old son stopped the car by the side of the road while my nine-year-old said with something like awe, "Mama, look down there!"

At the corners of some of the squares were farm houses nestled beneath tall, stately poplars. As we gazed with delight, I could almost hear the poplars, with arms upraised to God, whisper a supplication for those within the home they were guarding.

T RETROSPECT

No one saw the moonlight tangled in the myriad blossoms.
Or heard the wind singing in the night.
No one knew the tree | planted
Still dropped petals on the lawn,
Nor heard the muted voices saying, "All are gone."
No one listened to my footsteps
As in memory I walked alone,
Back into the yesterdays of my childhood home.

Casseroles for the Summer Picnic

Alice Willardson

"Dinner-in-a-Dish" is so easy to serve. It can be prepared beforehand for company or Sunday dinner. It can be baked in any sized baking dish, a big one for the family, or to take to a home where the mother is ill; or divide the recipe and bake one today and freeze the other to use later. It is fun to fill one or two individual size baking dishes and take them to a sick person or to someone living alone. They are more welcome than sweets.

You can use any kind of meat, poultry, or seafoods. Leftovers are not leftovers anymore, if you put them in a tasty casserole. Cold roasts, tuna, chicken, turkey, ham, sausage, or even bacon crisps are delicious. Rice, spaghetti, egg noodles, are all good bases, but so are vegetables like potatoes or parsnips. Corn, peas, and beans can substitute as part of the base and add flavorful nourishment.

Of course, onions, peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes, herbs, and spices are all at your command. Asparagus or broccoli and parsley will add color. There are a variety of sauces, from plain white sauce, or cheese sauce, to mushroom or cream of chicken soup, and don't forget to use the stock from chicken or roast meats, or any kind of gravy.

Buttered bread crumbs, crushed potato chips, or cheese dress up the top and hold in all those good flavors. So be original, have a change, try a delightful, big casserole for that summer picnic or for any other occasion!

GRANDFATHER'S DAY
Evelyn Fyeldsted

Growing old, f*) Grandfather said,
was like coming to the close of a long, eventful day, a day of great blessings and many and varied y experiences.
Always there had been the need for prayers.
This was a time when the young folks were leaving to make of life a long, venturesome day for themselves, but Grandpa said their nearness would always remain, with the knowledge that they would return, if ever they were needed.

Wherever Grandpa was, there seemed to be a kind of peace,
and whenever he entered a room, there was that same quiet reassurance.
It was as if he, having lived long, had found something that we had not yet known.
Daylight was like the light of evening for Grandpa, and so he had come to rely mostly on insight.
He said there was no need for hurry or for worry,
for time was on the side of those who had lived long—a time when life was better understood.

The time had come when Grandpa could nap undisturbed, which he did quite frequently.
He would awaken always with a sense of peace,
which must have come from this deeper understanding and which seemed to have become almost a part of him.
At times he still played his violin—the violin that had made so much merriment for the people in the valley long ago.
The musicmaker of his time, who had played in such a lively fashion,
could still imagine the young people and older ones dancing the waltz and the square dances that were so beautiful at that time.
To him it could have been only yesterday.

He could be remembering the time when he was just a boy carrying water to the soldiers who were stationed at the Racky Point during the Indian Wars in Sanpete County.
Sometimes two other grandpas, two other Indian War veterans, would come to visit with him.
Grandpa would awaken and welcome them.
They would place their chairs close together.
They could not hear each other very well, but they would talk and laugh about many things.
Sometimes their talk would take a serious turn.
A sadness seemed to touch them for a little while,
but mostly they would have a good time.
When they were gone, Grandfather's quiet peace still seemed to be there,
the peace that he bequeathed to us.

5 haey, af 37 7 Olga Milius

I came from the sea—
from horizons far flung over tossing, billowing waves.
From a land of green rolling hills, perfumed flowers,
and softly falling rain that made the air as soft and fragrant as the blossoms it nurtured.

I crossed the ocean—a thousand miles of turbulent blue—and gray—and green,
for its colors changed with its moods, as a woman's eyes may darken with anger
or brighten with joy.
The spray of the storm on my face made me a part of the elements,
and brought me closer to God than I had ever been before.

I saw the New York skyline—the new world rising above the endless ocean,
and Liberty holding her torch on high.
I saw the great cities and the small towns of America.
I crossed her plains and her prairies, and came at last to her fabled West,
where jagged mountains cleft an azure sky.

I came to Utah.
For years I had sung, "Come, Come Ye Saints" and "O Ye Mountains High."
Now I walked where the pioneers had trod,
and saw the valley, and said, "This is the place."

And in a quiet square, in the heart of a city, I saw the temple spires,
I heard a mighty organ.
I saw a prophet, and I heard him speak—
and I was home.

This apron also serves as a tote bag.
It gives you service wherever you go, from Aunt Millie's parlor to Relief Society, to the beach, and even fishing with Father...
That is, if you'd rather knit or sew than fish.
When you sit for an hour or two knitting or embroidering,
you tie the apron bag around you, and your thread, thimble, yarn, and scissors
stay neat and clean and handy.
Knitting yarn stays untangled in the big pocket (the bag) in your 'lap.

If you are called to the phone, or to the kitchen to fix another sandwich, you quickly tuck your work in the bag and stand up without anything dropping to the floor, or without having to unwind yourself from your work. When you have finished your work, you merely untie the apron from your waist and tuck the strings and upper part of the apron into the pocket. Pull the drawstrings, and you are carrying a neat bag. No one would even suspect it is an apron.

This apron bag can be made from sailcloth, denim, or corduroy, or a heavy silk. It is very nice if you line it, but it is not necessary. WHAT YOU NEED: One piece of floral or other print fabric 15 inches by 32 inches. This makes the bag. You can use two smaller pieces, 15 inches by 16 inches, but you will have a seam across the bottom of the bag. You will need some plain fabric the same size as mentioned above for lining the bag. Next, you will need a piece of print fabric 7 inches by 16 inches for the apron part. This does not need a lining. Now you need two apron strings about 3 inches wide and 22 inches long, and a strip for a band 3 inches wide and 13 inches long. To make small pockets for thread, thimble, and other sewing accessories, cut a strip of the printed fabric 8 inches by 16 inches long. You will need some bias tape of matching or contrasting color for drawstrings and for trim.

TO MAKE: First, make the bag 55" x 32" by folding the 15 by 32-inch piece of material in half, right sides together and stitching up the sides as shown (figure 1). Sew the lining the same way. Now put the lining and the bag wrong sides together and turn about one-inch hem all around the top of the bag (figure 2). This makes the casing.

It's In the Bag

FIGURE 2
Make two buttonhole openings in the side seams at the top of the bag to run the drawstrings through. You will need two drawstrings, each about 42 inches long. One string goes in one buttonhole and all the way past the opposite hole, and back out the same place it began. The second string begins at the other buttonhole and is threaded the same way. Thus, the bag can be closed by pulling on both loops at the same time.

Make the apron by first folding the 8-inch by 16-inch strip (wrong sides together) in half the long way. This gives you a double strip 4 inches by 16 inches. Pin this strip with the raw edge along one raw edge of the apron piece. Now pin along the 4-inch edges to the apron. Stitch this strip to the apron as you wish in order to make pockets. Bind the two side edges of the apron and pocket strip with bias tape (figure 3). Now sew the band and strings on the apron as you would for any apron.

Join the apron to the bag by turning the bottom raw edge of the apron and pocket strip up about one-half inch and stitching across one side of the top inside edges of the bag so as not to interfere with the drawstrings of the bag (figure 4). You may want to make several of these apron bags, for they will be the hit of any bridal shower, or a best seller at your bazaar.

Ow, if Spring Be Late
Mabel Harmer
Chapter 4
Maureen Taggart, a librarian, goes to Britain to do genealogical research and look over an estate in Scotland to which she is joint heir. Just before leaving, she is attracted to Steve Madsen. On board the boat she befriends Diane Curran who also is a guest of the Taggarts.

Maureen stood at her bedroom window and looked out upon a world still shrouded in fog. The vanquished November sun barely outlined the pear tree, only a dozen feet away. She turned away with only the slightest shrug. The state of the weather did not matter today. She was off on an adventure. Ahead was a day in London with an attractive companion. Not only that, but she would get her first glimpse of the castle—after a fashion. No doubt Robert McPherson had put the best side forward. But, perhaps not. She had seen the work of artists who loved to paint ruins. Then, if there was time, she would ask him to take her to the National Art Museum. She had spent a couple of hours there when she was wandering about Trafalgar Square, but it would be ever so much more interesting, and certainly more instructive, to see it with an expert.

She put on her red knit suit. It not only looked warm, it was warm. Her tweed coat, purchased in England for an English winter, would give her the additional protection she would need. As she watched Diane slip into her sweater she asked, "Is the Markham menage colder—or just plain cold?"

"It isn't so bad, really. The study is small and the library can be well heated. So far, that's the best feature of the entire place. Just the same I'm wearing a cardigan on top of this pullover. Everyone tells me that by the time winter is over we'll be so used to this climate we won't know the difference."

"Yes—when winter is over," Maureen agreed.

"I wish that you were going into town with us." "Why the very idea! I wouldn't dream of it, even if I were free to go. I'm sure this is one occasion when three would definitely be a crowd."

"I'm sure I don't know why you would think so. Remember, it was Kitty who made the arrangements. At least, it was she who first suggested them." "Agreed," said Diane. "But the gentleman pursued it with such alacrity that I should still decline—even if I were free to go. Instead, I shall be poring over books so that I can inform a bride just what her financial obligations are for the wedding—who buys the flowers, etc. etc. At the same time, I shall be earning enough to pay for my own wedding some day, I hope."

"If Spring Be Late"
"So you would think. And I daresay she could if she cared to. Unless, that is, the secretaries have always done all the work."

Or it may be that she figures it as part of my training, and she may be right." Robert McPherson, who had stayed overnight in a nearby rooming house, arrived in the mid-morning to call for Maureen. Julia had waited to ride into town with them. As they settled down for the brief trip, she said, "You know I've been thinking about what Mrs. Murch said last night, and I'm going to have Mr. Edmunds look into it. He's a solicitor," she explained to Robert. "Taking a hard look at the facts of the case, we have to agree that, if she does have some money, and no survivors, it might as well go to us as to go for death duties. Then, too, we have kept her for twenty-five years, which could call for a settlement of some kind. We've been glad to do it and, what little money she has made from the sale of her afghans, we have always been more than willing that she should keep for her own use." "How did you get her in the first place?" asked Robert. "Isn't she related in any way?" "In no way whatever," Julia replied. "We had never seen nor heard of her until she showed up one day during the Blitz. She came with nothing but the clothes on her back. We found her wandering about in a daze and took her in. She has been with us ever since." "And had she no other family?" "As far as we know, there was just a daughter—Cynthia. Mrs. Murch has been so sure that Cynthia would come here that, for months, she met the train every day. Any new girl who comes to the house may be her daughter—or so she thinks. Except for that, she is perfectly normal and the best soul on earth." "Well," said Robert, "it is easy to understand how escaping from the Blitz could have upset anyone's mind, to some extent. I know, because I lost some of my family that way." "It must have been a dreadful time," said Maureen. "It is amazing that we see so few scars now. I understand that the city of London proper was almost completely destroyed." "That's right," replied Robert. "Even as late as ten years ago there was some rubble left. Let us hope and pray that it never happens again." By now they had arrived in the city. Julia bade them goodby, saying, "Have a good day. Have fun for me, too." "Thank you. We'll do that," replied Maureen smiling. Much to her surprise the fog, in the morning light, made London look almost lovely. The buildings had lost their stark gray outlines and seemed to be veiled in a silvery gold mist. The lights on the streets were wreathed in halos. "I wouldn't have believed it possible," she said. "Last night this was a dark, dense terror." "And may be again tonight," said Robert. "Back in '52 there was one that lingered on and became so dense that all traffic came to a halt and over 4000 people died in one week." "Were you here?" "No, fortunately. It is much brighter in the Highlands of Scotland, and much more comfortable merely to read about black fogs in the newspapers." "Have you always lived in Scotland?" she asked. "No, my love affair with Scotland began a year or two before that, when I went over to paint the lakes and remained to paint much of the rest of it, including your castle." In spite of the fog, there seemed to be as many people as ever rushing about. Robert took hold of her arm to guide her through the crowd. "The gallery is on a small street just off from Piccadilly Circus," he said. "It is a small gallery." They climbed some rather dingy steps to a second floor, but, inside the gallery, there was light and warmth. There were only a dozen people about, since it was still early in the day. "Most of these, no doubt," said Robert in a low voice, "are artists who have come to admire their own work, or else brought captive admirers, as I have done." "But such a willing captive," smiled Maureen. "I do hope so. I also hope for a frank and honest opinion. My paintings are over here on this south wall." Maureen went over eagerly, admitting to herself, at least, that she was more interested in a look at the castle than in the quality of the artist's work. So far, she had not even seen a snapshot. The first picture showed it rising in the morning mists within a field of heather. "Why it looks like a fairy castle!" she exclaimed. "It can't be this lovely!" "You are quite right. It can't and it isn't. This is the good side, if you know what I mean, and even this has been beautified. I have one of the bad side farther down. I even have the broken wall." The next picture was of a charming cottage. There were windows of small panes with boxes of gay flowers on the sills. There were hollyhocks growing in profusion and a gate entwined with morning-glories. "How perfectly lovely!" exclaimed Maureen. "I'm glad you think so," said Robert. "That is my home. Actually it is your home. It belongs to the estate. However, for the present I am living there. And this picture is not idealized. The cottage really looks just like that in the summer. It is the only part of the property that has been kept in any kind of repair." Moving on, he said, "Now take a look at this. Here is another side of the castle. It doesn't look to be very livable, does it?" "No," she answered. "Not unless you're a fresh air addict, which I definitely am not. Let's see the others." There were a dozen paintings in all, and Maureen could honestly admire them very much. "But, I do like the cottage best of all," she said. "So do I," he agreed quickly. "That's probably because my heart is in the cottage. It really is most charming. I hope that you can arrange to see it in the springtime." "Oh, I shall. We all plan to come during the Easter vacation. That should be just about the right time." "Yes, it should. I haven't looked at the dates. I hope that Easter comes late in April this year." "It does," said Maureen. "I shall probably be leaving to do a bit of traveling on the Continent after that." They looked at the other pictures. There were many to admire, but none that Maureen liked as well as she did Robert McPherson's. As they were leaving, an attendant handed them a list of the paintings with the prices. Maureen tucked it carefully away inside her handbag. She had already resolved to own the picture of the cottage. She would make the purchase when she came into town on Monday. They went to a small tea room close by for lunch.

It was very cozy, with a young waitress in ruffled cap and apron, looking very much as if she had just been scrubbed. The lamps on the tables were lighted against the fog outside. Maureen ordered blueberry scones and hot chocolate. The scones were flaky and so delicious that she almost longed for seconds. "What now?" asked Robert. "The day is still young and it is all yours." "I would really love to go to the National Art Museum," she replied. "I've been there for a few hours, but it is so vast that it would take days to see it all. Anyway, it would be a real treat to go there with an expert." "Thank you. I'm not sure that I can meet all the qualifications that you expect—or might wish—but I'll be glad to try. It will be a treat for me, too." They walked the short distance to Trafalgar Square and climbed the few steps into the imposing gray stone building. There were corridors leading to fascinating vistas in each direction, and Maureen turned to Robert for guidance. "We can't see it all today," he said, "nor would you want to. If you simply walk through the rooms you don't see anything well. Let's take the Dutch painters. You've seen plenty of English today, anyway. Although I must qualify that quickly. You haven't seen the kind that you will see here." "Are there no great artists today?" asked Maureen. "Who knows? It is very seldom that a generation gives just recognition to the artist or composer within his lifetime. I think it one of the great tragedies of humanity that such men as Rembrandt have died almost penniless and, later, their works have become priceless. It is also true of people in other fields and even of statesmen." "Yes, I know," she nodded. "And, speaking of Rembrandt, do let us see some of his. I am going to Amsterdam especially to see his 'Night Watch.' At any rate, I am going to see that before anything else." "Believe me, it is worth going to see. And there are several here for which I can say the same." They spent a couple of hours viewing some of the paintings, and Maureen was delighted to have the highlights explained to her—the richness of the colors, the wonderful skin tones, the varied expressions in the faces. "You must also see some of Van Dyck," said Robert, "although he is Flemish, rather than Dutch. But his portraits are justly among the most famous in the world." "If it is only for the Van Dyck beard," observed Maureen. "He certainly did well by King Charles. I trust that Charles did as well by him." By mid-afternoon Robert said, "We really should start back, much as I would like to stay here. We don't want to get caught in a black fog." "Indeed we don't," she answered quickly. "One such experience is enough for me, although you could probably find your way back all right." "No one can be sure. And I don't really know my way about London especially. We can come here again." "Oh, I do hope so," she exclaimed. "I want to spend some time at the British Museum, also. In fact, I hope to do some of my research there. I understand that they have almost endless bookshelves. It is most fortunate that I have all winter for my work." As they went outside, they were no longer greeted by the silvery glow of the morning. There was now only the promise of another black evening. People were hurrying about to avoid having to grope their way home later in the darkness. They found the train crowded, but they managed to get on and even to find a seat for Maureen. Robert bade her goodby at the door, but said that he would return later that evening to talk with them about any further arrangements at the castle. There were still a couple of hours before dinner, and Maureen settled down by the cheery fire in the living room to await the others of the family. Kitty was the first to return home, and If Spring Be Late she was bubbling over with plans for moving to Scotland. "Perhaps we should follow the lead of the Earl of Bedford and have lions roaming about the grounds," was her first suggestion. "Of course, we might have a bit of trouble getting the lions in the first place and keeping them in the second," said Maureen. "But those are small matters, I am sure." "You're not at all sure," said Kitty, "so we'll forget that one. Anyway, there may not be enough tourists to make it pay. Perhaps a better plan would be to put up a youth hostel for the people who are traveling about Scotland on foot. They could stay overnight, or as long as they wish. I understand that they don't expect much in the way of creature comforts. Some hostels allow people to stay, even if they are driving about in motor cars." "And by the same token, we could not expect much in the way of remuneration, I daresay," her father commented as he came in to join the circle by the fireside. "Probably so," Kitty agreed. "But a shilling or so a head might prove worthwhile if enough people came. Then we could sell them fruits and eggs and vegetables. I believe the more complete the ruins of the castle, the better some people would like it. More romantic, you know." "And more uncomfortable," said Maureen. "Well, we shall see. With your imagination I am sure we'll come up with something." "I hope so," said Bruce. "The July 1968 Governors are taking a dim view of my prospects—or rather what they regard as my prospects for remaining at the school. They want to know at once if I plan to retire and move to Scotland, so that they can begin looking for a successor. I don't want to make any plans for a change until I have been over there—quite naturally. The facts are that one member would like very much to have me leave. I have been a trifle too modern in my methods to suit him, and he sees this as an opportunity to get in someone from the old, old school." "About 1910," said Julia from the doorway. "Don't give in an inch. It would be rather awful to have the school lose all that you have built up there." "Thank you," said her father. "You're home a trifle early, aren't you?" "Yes, I thought it best to get out of the city before the traffic was slowed down any more. And, thank goodness for the weekend, although there are signs that the fog is beginning to lift. Now, what about that school situation?" "Only that Andrew Wharton sees an excuse for getting me out—if he can. But we shan't worry about it. What did you learn at the bank, if anything?" "Mr. Edmunds went over and found out that there definitely is an account for Mrs. Murch. Of course, they wouldn't tell him how much."

After drawing interest for twenty-five years, it could be considerable. Now we have to prove that Mrs. Murch is the one who made the deposit. How do we go about that?" 

524 "T'm not sure. As I remember, she came here with nothing but the clothes on her back. She may have retrieved something from the fire. We can ask."

Butt dinner, when the family was once more gathered around the hearth he said, "Mrs. Murch, we've been thinking about your kind offer to help us restore the castle—if such is possible. Julia's employer has found out that you do, indeed, have an account in the savings department of the bank. Do you, by any chance, have a passbook?"

Mrs. Murch went on with her knitting, scarcely raising her eyes. "I brought nothing," she replied. "I was down in the tube when the Blitz came. The next morning the house was nothing but rubble. There's a bakery now where it stood. It's a very nice bakery. Sometimes I go there to see if any of my old neighbors are about. They never are."

There was silence for a few moments. Then Julia said, "Perhaps you will go into town with us on Monday. Mr. Edmunds will take you to the bank and find out what we can do to prove that the money is yours. Then, if you decide you would like to pay us something for your keep the past years, it would be rather nice."

"Oh, to be sure," said Mrs. Murch easily. "Ill never need the money—so long as I live with you—of course. But I shall not go to Scotland. I'll have to stay here in this house—just in case, you know."

"Yes, we know," said Catherine kindly. "Perhaps none of us will go to Scotland for more than just a visit. At any rate, we shall keep this place and it will be your home."

"Well, I don't see how I can run a youth hostel all by myself," said Kitty, "Some of you will have to stay and help."

"That's a long way off," said her father. "And we'll cross those bridges when we come to them. In the meantime, I can promise you this. You will not be left to run a youth hostel by yourself."

Robert McPherson arrived soon afterwards, and they all spent a pleasant hour before he bade them goodby. As he took Maureen's hand in parting, he said, "Remember we covered only the Dutch and Flemish artists at the museum. There are still the Spanish and French—not to mention the English. I shall be back soon."

"Good," replied Maureen. "Tl be looking forward to another delightful tour."

In the room later that evening, Diane said, "I think that you have made a conquest. He had a very special look for you."

"Nonsense," answered Maureen. "You're as bad as Kitty when it comes to imagination."

"Well, we shall see what we shall see. But you must admit that you find him attractive."

"Certainly. Pll admit it with no hesitancy or qualifications. And may I add—so what?"

"So, he's an eligible suitor, and you are a beautiful heiress."

"With a broken-down ruin of a castle and no money," Maureen interrupted. "Not enough to restore it, anyway. How did your day go?"

"If Spring Be Late

"The same—work, work, work. That woman is impossible—almost. But I certainly am learning a lot."

"And getting paid for it," said Maureen. "So you have something of a bright lining to your cloud."

"T have, indeed, and I'm grateful," said Diane. "Only, I wish that I didn't have to work tomorrow.. Everyone else gets Saturday off. However, I can be glad that she doesn't insist upon Sunday as well. Sydney is coming out to go to church with us."

"Good. I hope that he likes it. I'm ever so glad that you do."

"Oh, yes, indeed. I think that you Mormons are wonderful. I never have known anyone to be so kind. By the way, is your Mr. McPherson a Mormon?"

Maureen laughed. "I am sure he is. But don't call him my Mr. McPherson."

"Well, we shall see. As I said before."

"As I'm saying now, let's go to sleep. I've had enough excitement for one day."

'Ah, so the day was exciting! Well, that's promising.'

Maureen made no answer. Nor did she drop off to sleep right away. The day had been most interesting. She would go back Monday and buy the painting of the cottage, if she could afford it. She would much rather have it than one of the castle. Come to think of it, she would rather have the cottage. It was simply enchanting. Maybe she would take that for her share of the estate and let Bruce have the rest.

532 SPIRITUAL LIVING Lesson 89 - The Law of Tithing

Elder Roy W. Doxey (Reading Assignment: Doctrine and Covenants, Section 119)

Northern Hemisphere: First Meeting, October 1968 Southern Hemisphere: March 1969

OBJECTIVE: The Latter-day Saint woman views the payment

INTRODUCTION

The modern revelations emphasize the need for members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to build Zion on the earth. (D&C 6:6-7.) The earliest law of the dispensation to assist in the building of Zion upon the earth was the law of consecration. (D&C 42:33-36.) When this law was placed in abeyance, the Lord revealed the law of tithing as the next method of obtaining revenue for the growth of his kingdom.

(Ibid., 105:9-10;119.) Before the law of tithing was fully revealed, the Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, in 1834, committed themselves to the principle of tithing. (Joseph Smith, History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, ed. B. H. Roberts, 2d ed. Rev.; Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1957, Vol. 2, p. 175 [commonly called Documentary History of the Church; hereafter referred to as DHC].) When this law was made known, in 1838, at Far West, Missouri, it came in response to this supplication: "O Lord! Show unto thy servant how much thou requirest of the properties of thy people for a tithing." ([Ibid., 3:44.) At an earlier period the law of tithing was prophetically mentioned in a revelation while the law of consecration was in force. The Lord said that it was "a day of sacrifice, and a day for the tithing of my people..." (D&C 64:23.) ([Ibid., 64:24; Hyrum M. Smith and Janne M. Sjodahl, Doctrine and Covenants Commentary, rev. Ed.; Salt Lake City: The Deseret Book Company, 1957, p. 394.) A LESSER LAW The law of tithing became a schoolmaster to bring the members of the Church to the greater law of consecration, as the law of Moses anciently was the lesser law to bring ancient Israel to the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. (Melvin J. Ballard, Conference Report, October 1929, pp. 50-51.) Although a law may be thought of as lesser, it does not follow that the lesser of the two laws does not require obedience. In fact, all of God's laws are everlasting or eternal in the same way that the law of tithing is declared to be "a standard law unto them forever..." (D&C 119:4.) All laws remain forever, yet they may not all be in force at the same time, some serving as preparation to the living of other laws. AN ETERNAL INHERITANCE The faithful saint lays claim to an inheritance when the earth is redeemed and sanctified. (D&C 88:19-22.) Those who obey the law of tithing are acquiring an inheritance on the celestialized earth. Malachi said that those whose names are found in the book of remembrance are those "that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name. And they shall be mine in that day when I make up my jewels." (Malachi 3:16-18.) Lesson Department THE LAW OF TITHING In answer to the prayer as to what constitutes a tithe, the Lord revealed that the members of the Church should pay "one-tenth of all their interest annually." (D&C 119:4.) As Elder Howard W. Hunter has said: Interest means profit, compensation, increase. It is the wage of one employed, the profit from the operation of a business, the increase of one who grows or produces, or the income to a person from any other source... (Howard W. Hunter, Conference Report, April 1964, p. 35.) When the law of tithing was received, the Lord required that his saints should begin their tithing with giving all of their surplus property to the Church, and thereafter to pay one-tenth on their income. (D&C 119:1.) A GIFT OR AN OBLIGATION? Whether or not tithing is a gift or an obligation may be answered with the reply that since the law is a commandment then it is obligatory upon all members of the Church who receive an income to pay tithing. If tithing were a gift, the saint would not be required to surrender the tithe, but he could pay it whenever he desired or not pay it at all. "Verily, thus saith the Lord, I require... One-tenth of all their interest annually" (Ibid., 119:1, 4.) Tithing is, however, a voluntary offering because the Lord does not compel his people to live a commandment. This law is no different from the law of the Sabbath or any of the laws of the gospel. Each person decides whether or not he wants the blessing arising from obedience to the law. (Ibid., 130:20-21.) DEBTS AND TITHING The Old Testament Prophet Malachi expressed the truth that when a person withheld the tithe from the Lord, he was robbing him. Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation. (Malachi 3:8-9.) Expressed in the language of Elder Howard W. Hunter, we learn the following: The Lord has established the law of tithing, and because it is his law, it becomes our obligation to observe it if we love him and have a desire to keep his commandments and receive his blessings. In this way it becomes a debt. The man who doesn't pay his tithing because he is in debt should ask himself if he is not also in debt to the Lord. The Master said: "But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness: and all these things shall be added unto you." (Matthew 6:33.) We can't walk east and west at the same time. We can't serve both God and mammon. The man who rejects the law of the tithe is the man who has not given it a fair try. Of course it costs something. It takes work and thought and effort to live any of the laws of the gospel or any of its principles. (Conference Report, April 1964, p. 35.) Class Discussion Elder Hunter suggests that the person in debt should pay his tithing. What reasons would you give for this counsel? BEWARE OF FALSE TEACHING What would you do if you were told by a good member of the Church that although you have an income from wages, rent, and so forth, you should not pay your tithing? This is the way this question was solved by the widowed mother of President Joseph F. Smith when he was but a boy. When she arrived at the tithing office with a load of potatoes as her tithing, the clerk chided her for paying her tithing. Whereupon she said: "William, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. Would you deny me a blessing? If I did not pay my tithing, I should expect the Lord to withhold his blessings from me. I pay my tithing, not only because it is a law of God, but because I expect a blessing by doing it. By keeping this and other laws, I expect to prosper, and to be able to provide for my family." In relating this story, President Smith testified that she had an abundance to support her family and that her family never lacked. Then he said: "That widow had her name recorded in the book of the law of the Lord..." (Joseph F. Smith, Gospel Doctrine, tenth edition, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1956, pp. 228-229.) RECORDS IN HEAVEN The Prophet Joseph Smith said that "Our acts are recorded, and at a future day they will be laid before us..." (DHC 2:26.) The Church maintains an accurate record of the tithing paid by the members.

Not long after the law of consecration was revealed, the Lord made known that a general Church record of all things that transpired in Zion should be made. The names of those who were not diligent were not to be recorded with the faithful. It was said that the "book of the law of God" (D&C 85:5) would not contain the names of this class. (D&C 85:1-5.) The faithful, on the other hand, were promised that they should have their names recorded in the "Lamb's book of life." (Revelation 21:27; D&C 128:7.) This record is maintained in the heavens and contains the names of those who have kept the commandments, including the law of tithing. Members of the Church should know that on many occasions during their lives they are judged by their bishops to receive blessings the Church may bestow upon them. The principle of tithing is a measure, with other commandments, to determine a person's worthiness.

Class Discussion
Why do you think that the Lord requires that a person pay his tithing in order to receive a temple recommend?

ANCIENT PROMISES�BLESSINGS TODAY?
Malachi's words have profound meaning for today. (Malachi 3:8-18.) His condemnation of the people for their having robbed God in their tithes and offerings reminds one of Elder Howard W. Hunter's characterization of the non-tithe payer in these words:...
In larceny there is an unlawful acquisition of the property, while in embezzlement the property which belongs to another is acquired lawfully and then fraudulently converted to the possessor's use. In order to memorize these distinctions [while in law school], I pictured in my mind, to represent larceny, a masked burglar, sneaking about under the cover of darkness, taking that which was not his. To represent the theory of embezzlement I thought of a non-tithepayer. The Lord's share came into his hands lawfully, but he misappropriated it to his own use. This seems to be the accusation of Malachi. (Conference Report, April 1964, p. 34.)

The Lord has said that every man is only a steward over his earthly possessions, for all that exists belongs to the Lord. (D&C 104:13-14.) One may think of the tithe as the payment of rent for the air one breathes, the clothes one wears, or the food he eats; in fact, for all earthly possessions.

A CHALLENGE
The challenge of the law of tithing is expressed in these words: "... Prove me now herewith, saith the Lord. Of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it." (Malachi 3:10.) "Prove me" by living my law and see the results!

Elder James E. Talmage expressed the point that since man has a need for the material things of the earth to support himself and family, the Lord has promised that the means of acquiring these things are available, but one's life may not be one of uniform increase in substance and possessions. One pays the rental in accordance with the amount of increase received during a given year. As more is received then more is expected, but if less is received, then less is expected. Consequently, all the faithful, the poor or the rich, may be cease 537 July 1968 stockholders in the great corporation of God. (James E. Talmage, Articles of Faith, Forty-seventh Edition; Salt Lake City, p. 527-528.)

Elder Melvin J. Ballard observed that one should not pay his tithing with the hope that he will be immediately benefited financially. He said the following:
I have listened to the testimonies of thousands in the mission field, converts to the Church, who have had faith in this law, and who have paid their tithing, and the Lord has manifested His good pleasure towards them by bringing a material increase that greatly relieved them of distresses that were pressing upon them. Do I mean to say that a man who has an income of a hundred dollars and pays ten dollars of it into the Church for the Lord's work, can make the ninety dollars go as far as the hundred? Yes, by wisely spending it, sometimes a good deal farther. I have observed it is not brains nor strength that brings material prosperity altogether. It is simply doing the right thing at the right time that leads on to success. (The Deseret News, December 17, 1927, p. V.)

Class Discussion
How may the payment of tithing lead to wise planning?

"WINDOWS OF HEAVEN"
One of the stirring episodes in Church history was presented to the Church by film under the title "Windows of Heaven." The event occurred in the year 1899 when President Lorenzo Snow received the inspiration to take many of the General Authorities to St. George, Utah, to hold conference. While there he received a revelation on tithing. The saints in that area were discouraged because a severe drought had made it virtually impossible for them to plant their crops. The Church was also heavily in debt.

During one of the conference meetings, the Lord revealed to the President of the Church the means by which the people and the Church might be blessed. This account is given of that experience:
God manifested to him there and then not only the purpose of the call to visit the Saints in the South. He told them that he could see, as he had never realized before, how the law of tithing had been neglected by the people, also that the Saints, themselves, were heavily in debt, as well as the Church, and now through strict obedience to this law—the paying of a full and honest tithing—not only would the Church be relieved of its great indebtedness, but through the blessings of the Lord this would also be the means of freeing the Latter-day Saints from their individual obligations, and they would become a prosperous people. (The Church News, January 20, 1934, p. 4.)

Subsequently, events proved that the promise of the Lord through President Snow was literally fulfilled in behalf of the members of the Church who accepted the Lord's challenge, and because of their acceptance of the law of tithing the Church came out of financial bondage. The prosperity of the saints and the accomplishments of the Church have resulted because of obedience to the law of tithing and all other commandments.

Class Discussion
Faith in and practice of the Lord's commandments bring happiness and prosperity.

A WARNING
A person who has covenanted with the Lord in baptism and then fails to pay his tithing becomes spiritually sick. One of the sure signs of weakened faith and loss of spirituality is due to this cause. The neglect of one principle of the gospel invariably causes neglect in other principles. (Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses, 15:163.)

A purpose of the law of the tithe is that a person may receive soul growth from the practice. The law, faithfully observed, has the effect of uprooting selfishness and demonstrating loyalty to the kingdom of God. It testifies to the fact that one desires to become one with the Lord in working for his purposes on earth and in heaven.

BUILD THE KINGDOM In addition to the growth of spirituality received by the tithepayer, the Lord's work prospers through the revenue from the tithing. The progress of the Church in the erection of meetinghouses, temples, welfare programs, missionary work, and many other programs are provided from the tithes of the people. The dedicated Latter-day Saint works for the building of the kingdom of God through the payment of tithing.

IMPLEMENTATION

The Latter-day Saint who obeys the law of tithing is living a spiritual law _ necessary for a successful life. Although tithing funds are used for the construction of material things, as buildings, nonetheless, the use made of those structures, such as a temple or meeting place, is for spiritual purposes. Not only is the tithepayer contributing to his own spiritual welfare, but also to the welfare of his fellow Church members. The Lord has said that obedience to this law sanctifies the land of Zion unto him and unto us. (D&C 119:6.) In fact, it is revealed that Zion is those who keep the commandments, including the law of tithing. Since the purpose of the members of the Church is to build Zion on the earth, it is impossible to fulfill this purpose without making a contribution of one's means by which revenue is received to further the Lord's work.

The law of tithing has been called the law of inheritance. He who desires to receive a celestial inheritance must give full obedience to gospel requirements. There is no success in this life that does not include preparation for life eternal with the blessings of perpetual posterity in the celestial kingdom.

President Joseph F. Smith has emphasized the importance of the law of tithing in the following statement: By this principle the loyalty of the people of this Church shall be put to the test. By this principle it shall be known who is for the kingdom of God and who is against it. By this principle it shall be seen whose hearts are set on doing the will of God and keeping His commandments, thereby _ sanctifying the land of Zion unto God, and who are opposed to this principle and have cut themselves off from the blessings of Zion... (Conference Report, April 1900, p. 47.)

VISITING TEACHER MESSAGES �Truths to Live By (Correlated With the Family Home Evening Manual, 1968-69)

Message 1�Today Is Part of Our Eternal Life Alice Colton Smith Northern Hemisphere: First Meeting, October 1968 Southern Hemisphere: March 1969

OBJECTIVE: To understand that many of the riches � of eternal life are available to us at this time.

"And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent." (John 17:3.)

The mass media of our day extol the desirability of the riches of the earth. As soon as one can listen, understand, or read, one discovers that the constantly repeated values of the world emphasize power, wealth, comfort, position, status, pleasure, beautiful homes and furnishings, cars, and the advantage of material things of all kinds.

Amid the clamor of these insistent urgings to spend, buy, own, be, and do, comes the advice of our Savior and King, "Seek not for riches but for wisdom.... Behold, he that hath eternal life, is rich." (D&C 6:7.)

We know that at death we leave behind wealth, power, status, and material things. Why, then, do we spend so much of our energy and time in _ pursuing that which is so briefly ours? Why do we not listen to and act on the words of our Savior with greater devotion?

He instructed us further through the prophet Jacob:... But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God. And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good�to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted. (Jacob 2:18-19.)

Thus, God does not condemn riches, it is their unrighteous acquisition and use that are displeasing. In our day, however, the Lord urges us not to seek riches but to seek wisdom.

What are some of the riches of eternal life that are available to us in this life through our obedience to this commandment? They are wisdom, which may be defined as "the power of true and right discernment; also,-conformity to the course of action dictated by such discernment" (Funk and Wagnalls New Collegiate Dictionary); "ability to judge soundly and deal sagaciously with facts, especially as they relate to life and conduct " (Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary, 2d _ ed.); the knowledge of "the only true God, and Jesus Christ..." (John 17:3); the mysteries of God; the freedom of choice without coercion; communication with our Heavenly Father; the greatest of all the gifts of God." (D&C 14:7.)

Today is-a crucial part of eternity. Our whole future depends on what we believe and do here today and every day.

Wisdom, the mysteries of God, the riches of eternal life, or the gift of the Holy Ghost; the peaceable things of the Kingdom, and "eternal life, which gift is the riches of material things�for what do we seek? -HOMEMAKING�Development Through Homemaking Education

Discussion 1�Preparing for the Sabbath Day Celestia J. Taylor Northern Hemisphere: Second Meeting, October 1968 Southern Hemisphere: March 1969

OBJECTIVE: To show that in order to keep the Sabbath day holy, physical preparations should be made.

INTRODUCTION

What a happy, pleasant, holy day Sunday can be for the entire family when a feeling of order prevails, when things work smoothly because advance preparation and planning have eliminated most sources of frustration and irritation. Mothers have been heard to say that Sundays are the most difficult days, when actually they should be the most blessed and rewarding. How can we make them so?

Consultation with several wonderful women who seem to have successfully solved this problem reveals the evidence that, as is usually the case, the busiest mothers are those who have most of the answers.

To you mothers of small children who might feel that your problems are your own�as indeed they are�as well as to you who are the mothers of large families comprised of members of varying ages, the following discussion is directed in the hope that you may find some practical application to your own situation.

HOW SHALL WE PREPARE?

A sister, who is the mother of ten energetic and typically "nor- 541 July 1968 mal" children, gives us what she calls a "Basic recipe for a restful Sabbath day."

I. Prepare the atmosphere in the home.
A. Remember that "the Sabbath was made for man," and have the right attitude; make it a restful, happy day for yourself as well as for the family.
B. Inspire your husband to play his role as patriarch of the family by supporting you in your plans and assignments for the family.
C. Plan wisely.

II. Organize yourself and your children to prepare for a day of rest.
A. Organize meal planning, preparation, and cleanup.
1.

For Sunday dinner plan an easy, simple meal to prepare.  
2. Breakfast on Sunday morning is fruit juice and dry cereal.  
3. Plan an easy evening snack after sacrament meeting.  
4. Each member is assigned a cleanup duty after each Sunday meal as well as on weekdays.  
B. Organize to have the house clean.  
1. Each child is required to clean his own room thoroughly in addition to one other area either Friday or Saturday.  
2. On Saturday evening the children are reminded to check their assigned areas.  
C. Organize the preparation of clothes and personal selves for Sunday.  
Another sister, the wife of a doctor and bishop and mother of eight lovely and exemplary children, says: I want only a minimum of work done on Sunday, and yet I cannot feel at peace or in harmony with the Lord if my house is disorderly. So we try to make a practice of having the house clean and neat before retiring on Saturday. Then all that I require of my children on Sunday morning is to see that their beds are made and their clothes picked up before they go to Sunday School.  
She also says: Well, suppose the house is clean and the clothes are ready, is the family prepared for the Sabbath? No, they are only prepared to be prepared. Now it is necessary to create the spirit and atmosphere of the Sabbath. I like to put on some of our Tabernacle Choir records or encourage some of my children to practice the hymns on the piano or even sing some of the familiar hymns myself. I was surprised one day as I was singing "Joseph Smith's First Prayer," to have my little three-year-old join in the singing and then beg me to sing it over and over again.  
A talented mother of ten equally lovely and talented children tells of her procedure in the physical preparation for Sunday as follows:  
I On Saturday A. Children bathed and hair washed B. Clothes checked by Mother C. Menu planned for Sunday ("I have never stayed home from Sunday School to fix a Sunday meal whether we have had guests or not.") D. House cleaned and set in order for Sunday 542 Lesson Department II. On Sunday A. Older children help the younger ones get dressed for Sunday School. B. Mother rises early to see Father and the boys off to priesthood meetings and the older girls to prayer meeting and to supervise others. C. The meat or entree course, if not prepared in advance, is put on to cook and the kitchen tidied up after a light breakfast. D. After Sunday School certain children are assigned to set the table. ("We always use our best lace or linen cloths and our best silverware and glasses on Sunday... We try to teach the children good manners and give them the opportunity to put them into practice.")  
This sister sums up her comments by saying: I would like my children to remember that Sunday was the happiest day of the week and that we all looked forward to its coming because we received food for our souls, renewed our covenants with our Father in heaven, remembered each other with more love and kindness, and received the spirit and peace of the Savior with reverence.  
To Discuss 1. What are my responsibilities as a mother in preparing for the Sabbath? 2. How can I adapt the suggestions in the discussion to my own advantage? 3. Why is staying away from Sunday School and sacrament meeting no answer to the problem?  
CONCLUSION With the right attitude toward the Sabbath day and with the realization that careful and orderly physical preparation for it must be made, any mother, whether her family is large or small, can make the Sabbath a day of rewarding blessings for the entire family.

Christensen (Reference: Immortality and Eternal Life from the Writings and messages of President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., Melchizedek Priesthood Manual, 1968-69) Northern Hemisphere: Third Meeting, October 1968 Southern Hemisphere: March 1969 OBJECTIVE: To point out gospel teachings that influenced the life of President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., and to indicate how his life and writings may influence other lives for good.  
INTRODUCTION Valuable as man's individual accomplishments may be for the immediate time and situation, not until they are viewed from the distance of years do they sometimes assume their proper perspective of importance. History also bears out the truth that the results of important action may persist through the years with continuing benefit. So it may be with the accomplishments of J. Reuben Clark, Jr., whose contributions were many and whose life spanned a productive period of ninety years. Here, native ability plus consistent personal effort and a protecting Providence, resulted in significant service to his Church, the Nation, and in the development of a noble character. Much has been written about President Clark. Articles, biographies, sketches of his appointments, newspaper editorials, and isolated comments are numerous. Some have come from the pens of individuals who knew him as a national and international figure. Some were written by General Authorities of the Church, others by newspaper correspondents or editors or friends. Some have come from loved ones to whom his intimate personal characteristics are a constant motivation and a priceless memory. Since the 1968-69 social relations lessons are based (as are the 1968-69 Melchizedek Priesthood lessons) upon his life and writings, it is appropriate that, in this introductory lesson, we meet President Clark personally. The various facets of his personality and his experiences—President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., constitute profiles of action that have inspired thousands and may yet motivate thousands more for good. This lesson, quoting much from others, deals with facets in the light of "Profiles Remembered." Space allows but a fraction of what has been said and written about his contributions, yet it is hoped that the robust vigor of his mind, the integrity of his faith, and the tender warmth of his personality will somehow shine through the factual account of his accomplishments. For a more chronological account of his life, see lesson 1 of the Melchizedek Priesthood lessons for 1968-69; or if available, The Improvement Era, August, 1951, Vol. 54, pp. 560-563, 592: Article by John A. Widtsoe, "President J. Reuben Clark, Jr."; The Relief Society Magazine; June 1951, pp. 373-377: Article by Henry D. Moyle, "President J. Reuben Clark, Jr."  
PROFILE OF YOUTH Grantsville, Tooele County, Utah, 1871, was typical of many small Mormon communities in the western part of the United States in the late nineteenth century. Their populations were a composite of convert immigrants from many European countries brought together by a common love for the gospel of Jesus Christ which they had so recently accepted. These pioneers knew the meaning of toil, for work was basic to survival.

With persistent zeal they labored hours that the stubborn desert might be subdued and converted into productive farm and dairy acres. Life was simple, wholesome, and fundamentally religious, the devotional Sabbath climaxing the week where family prayers were offered daily. Thought and serious conversation often focused upon the eternal truths which answered their questions concerning the purposes of life and an after-life existence. Into such a community (Grantsville) and into a home where work and love and religion were a happy blend, Joshua Reuben Clark, Jr., was born, September 1, 1871. "His parents, Joshua Reuben and Mary Louisa Woolley Clark, were pioneers of Tooele County..." (The Improvement Era: Editorial, May 1968, p. 416.)

Young Reuben was always an avid reader. Evident, even in youth, his thirst for learning remained with him throughout life. Even in the pioneer home good reading material was available, although meager when compared to the voluminous library of his own home in later years. In his father's library "Reuben especially studied The Book of Mormon and took delight in looking at the large pictures in their family Bible. Many of Shakespeare's plays he read over and over, and also 'A History of Rome' and a biography of great men. Any minute which Reuben could snatch from the many chores, inside and out of home, was usually devoted to reading." ("Born to Greatness," Marianne C. Sharp, The Children's Friend, September 1954, p. 361.)

Following is a personal account which sheds a whimsical light upon his early teen-age interest in books, at the same time it impresses one with the importance of early home atmosphere and training.

I remember once when one of my brothers came to us, a good aunt came out to care for mother and the baby brother. She wanted me to do something. She hunted for me high and low, and at last finding me, she called to mother: "Here he is; reading again." I also remember that being the oldest, I had 'to tend" the younger ones. We had an old fashioned cradle. Mother would put the babe in the cradle and set me to rocking it to sleep. This I did by lying across the foot of the cradle, legs on one side, head and shoulders on the other, and as I rocked the babe, I sang—and read. Sometimes the singing stopped in the interesting part and the babe would cry, then a call from mother brought me back to earth and we, the babe and I, started back and forth on our rocking again. This went on till the babe couldn't keep awake any longer, so went to sleep.

In my mature years I have come to understand how limited is my brain energy, how short is my time, and how precious is my every moment. My rule now is—never read anything that is not worth remembering. I now know that all the wisdom of the past is for our use, and that the only place we can learn that wisdom which comes from all that men have thought, and worked, and suffered, and achieved, is from good books; and wisdom is one of the most precious gifts that the Lord has to give. ("What I Read As a Boy," by J. Reuben Clark Jr., The Children's Friend, March 1943, p. 99.)

Class Question How does this glimpse into President Clark's early reading and his mature reaction relate to the divine injunction, "seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith"? (D&C 88:118.)

PROFILE OF ACCEPTANCE AND APPLICATION

Willingness to work is a gospel teaching understood and consistently practiced by President Clark. In the Doctrine and Covenants we read: Thou shalt not be idle; for he that is idle shall not eat the bread nor wear the garments of the laborer. (D&C 42:42.)

In his Grantsville home, young Reuben learned early that in work there is dignity and satisfaction as well as necessity. Being the eldest of the nine children, there were many chores and responsibilities within the home and upon the farm. At sixteen years of age he was in full charge of the family farm. He also herded cattle for his uncle, Samuel Woolley, driving them to the summer range every spring and back to the winter range every fall. He knew, therefore, the language and hardships of the cowboy, and what it meant to stay in the saddle all day and all night, and to go without rest or sleep for twenty-four hours at a time. (Bryant S. Hinckley: The Relief Society Magazine, April 1949, p. 252.)

Class Involvement

1. Discuss briefly the value of establishing the principle and habit of work in youth, rather than waiting until later years.
2. Why do you believe that today's children, having less work to do, are apt to be more restless, even delinquent? President Clark not only learned to work in youth but he accepted this early training with a positive attitude. He loved to work. As we follow him through a long and productive life we observe that no amount of labor seemed too much nor too arduous for the objectives he wished to achieve. One of his objectives was to obtain an education and this he did, overcoming many obstacles in order to do so. At nineteen he left Grantsville and, going to Salt Lake City, he entered the Latter-day Saints University and, later, graduated from the University of Utah. Although the allowance was small, an assistantship at the Deseret Museum under Dr. James E. Talmage helped him financially. Here alertness of mind and diligent effort made him a leader in student affairs. The same mental application and diligence brought recognition and the coveted degree in law from Columbia University in 1906.

In words of guidance given to graduating students in a commencement address at the Brigham Young University in 1949, we see President Clark's mature thinking on the importance of work.

Work is the nearest substitute for genius, and genius without work is barren. If more people had to work for a living, instead of talking for it, the world would be better off. That President Clark's formula for success was hard work, was well known by friend and diplomat. When he was appointed United States Ambassador to Mexico, in 1930, one newspaper printed the following: Mr. Clark stands among the few diplomats of the first order that the West has produced. It is somewhat unfair to Ambassador Clark, however, to say that the West produced him. As a matter of fact, J. Reuben Clark, the Ambassador, is the product of J. Reuben Clark, the student, the investigator, the worker and the faithful servant of the government.

There is no finer example... in the whole history of the foreign service. Mr. Clark is responsible for his own success... ("President J. Reuben Clark, Jr." Henry D. Moyle, The Relief Society Magazine, June 1951, p. 374.)

It is obvious that President Clark did not expect to reap a harvest of success without planting the seed of desire and then cultivating that seed through diligent effort.

Class Involvement  
1. How may this example apply to Latter-day Saint women who are successful (a) in their homes; (b) in Church or civic assignments?  
2. How may we help our children to see the need for and benefit of work?  
PROFILE OF PERSONAL LIFE  
His family remembers President Clark as a husband and father who was devotion itself. He had a fierce love and pride in his children. He guarded them with every fiber of his being, and was their severest but at the same time loving critic. He demanded the best from them; pointing out errors in their thinking with a kindly bluntness that left no doubt as to his meaning. His approval was vital to them, and this was one of the great motivating factors for good in their lives. He lavished upon them what material comforts he could, but his foremost concern was the condition of their souls and to this he brought his keenest effort. To them he was a pillar of power and strength, and the center of their home which revolved around and honored him as the patriarch of his family. He delighted in any of their accomplishments and was sympathetically sympathetic with their failures. One of the most outstanding characteristics of his life was his deep respect and reverence for womanhood. His wife, whom he cherished with humble, unwavering love, and his daughters were tenderly sheltered and guarded by him with every force at his command. He stood almost in awe of mother-love nurtured by the deep love and esteem, almost reverence, which he felt for his own beloved mother, often declaring mother-love to be more like the love God feels for his children than any other. He was endowed with a keen sense of humor, and his spirit of acute discernment gave him uncanny insight into the lives of his three daughters, Louise, Marianne, and Luacine, and son Reuben III. He never minced words, but his children knew that at the base of every reprimand was unquestioned love and devotion to them. To his family he personified the righteous, God-fearing, obedient child of the new and everlasting covenant that he wanted them to become.  
PROFILE OF INFLUENCE ON THE INTERNATIONAL SCENE  
In order to evaluate the influence of President Clark in the field of human relations on the international scene, we must review, very briefly, a few of his many appointments to governmental positions. After receiving a degree in law from Columbia University, New York City, where he was a distinguished student and editor of the legal department of the Columbia Law Review, he was appointed assistant solicitor of the United States Department of State under Secretary Elihu Root. In 1910, after four distinguished years of service, he became solicitor, which is the chief legal officer of the State Department. Later, as Under Secretary of State, he moved more and more into the field of international law, in which he became a foremost authority and is so recognized today. (Melchizedek Priesthood Manual, 1968-69, Lesson 1.) "In 1930 he was appointed United States Ambassador to Mexico. During his three-year service he helped to settle many an international controversy, such as the oil rights of foreigners in Mexico, the correct boundary lines between Mexico and the United States, the division of the waters of the Rio Grande. Best of all, Mexico and the United States worked together as friends during President Clark's ambassadorship." (Ibid.) What personal qualities contributed to President Clark's diplomatic success? From Mr. Howland Cox, staff writer for the Christian Science Monitor, we quote: (Christian Science Monitor, September 1, 1931.) The Ambassador's seemingly unfailing knack of winning and holding friends stands him in good stead. Perhaps it is his willingness to listen to the "other fellow's side of the story" that endears him to the people of that southern republic. Perhaps it is his entirely sincere desire to place all cases fairly before his nation, and before the nation to which he is an accredited representative. That is why Mexico trusts him. And why Mexico is willing to work with him. And why Mexico likes him.  
Lesson Department  
The article continues: To really know the man one must meet him in his home. He has a wife and a daughter, Luacine. [Other family members were not in Mexico at this time.] See them and it is not difficult to understand why the Ambassador looks upon the world through clear, friendly eyes. They are a versatile group. The Ambassador with his hobby of photography; Mrs. Clark with her work among the needy of Mexico City, and the daughter with her music. To hear them discuss their "tasks of the moment"... Is to wonder how anyone at all can remain idle.  
Class Involvement Questions  
1. Why do you think empathy is important in international affairs as well as in personal relationships?  
2. What other personal qualities gave Ambassador Clark the "knack of winning and holding friends"?  
3. How may these qualities apply to you, to me, in all neighborhood problem situations?  
PROFILE OF CHURCH SERVICE  
The profile of Church service is considered last in this lesson because appointment to membership in the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and to apostleship came in the richly mature years of President Clark's life, after he had won distinction in the world of legal and diplomatic affairs. His service to the Church, however, actually began in Grantsville, as a boy. In 1925 he was appointed to the General Board of the YMMIA. Very many of President Clark's mature years, however, were lived away from the organized units of the Church. He was a consistent Latter-day Saint, and, at all times, lived in strict harmony with the standards of gospel teachings.... His work while in Washington was one of the finest examples of missionary work ever done, for he preached Mormonism in every act of his life. (Editorial, The Improvement Era, May 1933.) In 1933, at the conclusion of his ambassadorship to Mexico, he was sustained as Second Counselor to President Heber J. Grant, whom he served for twelve years. He was ordained an apostle in 1934. Until his death October 6, 1961, he was a member of the First Presidency, serving also under President George Albert Smith and President David O. McKay. Elder Albert E. Bowen, an associate in the Council of the Twelve, characterized President Clark thus: The personal endowment and qualities which have made possible his varied and distinguished achievements are perhaps three, with their corollaries: First: A vigorous and discriminating intellect. His is the rare power of penetrating through all confusing, superficial envelopments to the root and marrow of a confronting problem. Second: A prodigious power of work—a constitution which seems able to respond to any draft that may be made upon it. Work is his vocation and his avocation, his pursuit and his pastime. Third: An uncompromising, undeviating honesty—intellectual and moral honesty. "Face the Facts," is a characteristic expression of his. He spends no time in working upon schemes of evasion.... (The Relief Society Magazine, June 1951, p.

374.) To the member of the Church, perhaps the most important characteristic was the quality of his faith and humility, which radiated from his every conference address. In 1946 an editorial in the Deseret News states: Those who know President Clark intimately know that he is guided and motivated in his Church leadership by as profound and simple a faith as is possessed by any man in the Church. The Standard Works of the Church are his guide, and he accepts without question the word of the Lord as contained therein. The experiences of Joseph Smith are as real to him as any of his own. He has never doubted the divine mission of the Savior, and has spent a great part of his life in making a study of the life and works of the Master while he was upon earth. He does not doubt that God lives and that he hears and answers the prayers of the righteous.... (Church News, August 31, 1946.)

SUMMARY
Frequently men may excel in one area of endeavor or in one aspect of character, their accomplishments winning the recognition of men. President Clark was a balanced, well-rounded man. In him no facet of the good life was undeveloped. He was the student, friend, father, counselor, man of productive action, and one of deep religious faith. Through memory and through his published writings the profile of his clear thinking, articulate speech, his faith and his steadfast adherence to principle, will continue to inspire and motivate for good.

Recommendations for musical selections for lesson 1 of the cultural refinement course, year 1968-1969:
MUSIC
16th-Century Instrumental Suite Two Selections from Ancient Dances and Airs for Lute by Ottorino Respighi (Italian, 1879-1936) Commentary on musical selections by Clawson Cannon, Assistant Dean of College of Fine Arts, Brigham Young University The purpose in choosing these selections is twofold: First, the music chosen is not a part of the standard repertory; indeed, it is not known at all but to the few enthusiasts for old and new music. These lovely pieces should help the sisters to realize how many beautiful works of music are awaiting their discovery. Second, in the 16th-century suite, instruments are employed that are not used today; in "Ancient Dances and Airs," well-known instruments are used in new and colorful ways. Thus, these selections should encourage the sisters to be more aware of individual sounds and colors that are a part of the musical fabric.

The selections recommended should allow the Relief Society sisters the opportunity to experience the excitement of discovering new aspects of music.
551 July 1968 INTRODUCTION TO LITERATURE LESSON The objective of this month's lesson becomes even more challenging when we realize that the "world" in which we live is not one world but several—the vast physical world and all its wonders and beauty, the unseen spiritual world and its powers, the world of people, their complex types and relationships, the hidden world within each person and all its complexities of feeling and thought, and, finally, the world of eternal truths and principles that bind all these other worlds into a harmonious unity. Our goal is to discover all these worlds as fully and honestly as possible, to separate the trivial from the significant in what we discover, to direct our lives in harmony with eternal principles, and to give our energies towards making the world better and more beautiful.

DISCOVERY THROUGH THE PHYSICAL SENSES
When anyone mentions the excitement of discovery, people usually think of looking with their eyes, for sight is the natural beginning of exploring the world. At least it is for most people. And the worth of our eyes as cameras with which to see the detailed wonders of the world is made especially dramatic and poignant whenever we meet one who is blind, as in the following simple poem by the English poet W. W. Gibson:

SIGHT
By the lamplit stall I loitered, feasting my eyes
On colors ripe and rich for the heart's desire—
Tomatoes, redder than Krakatoa's fire,
Oranges like old sunsets over Tyre,
And apples golden-green as the glades of Paradise.
And as I lingered, lost in divine delight,
My heart thanked God for the goodly gift of sight
And all youth's lively senses keen and quick.
When suddenly, behind me in the night,
I heard the tapping of a blind man's stick.

Not many people are literally blind, but there is another kind of blindness that is widespread—the blindness that comes from looking without seeing. We are surrounded on all sides with the wonders of nature and people, but how many of us see what we look at? One of the most important gifts of many poets is that they see things sharply and describe them accurately, making simple things become vividly interesting and helping others to "see" things around them that have been there all the time, but they have never noticed before.

As an example, study the following little poem by Rupert Brooke, a gifted young British soldier-poet who died of blood poisoning early in World War I:

From "The Great Lover"
These I have loved:
White plates and cups, clean-gleaming,
Ringed with blue lines; and feathery, faery dust;
Wet roofs, beneath the strong crust
Of friendly bread; food; Rainbows;
And radiant raindrops couching in cool flowers;
And flowers themselves, that through sunny hours, lamp-light; and many-tasting sway
Dreaming of moths that drink them under the moon;
Then, the cool kindliness of sheets, that soon
Smooth away trouble; and the rough male kiss
Of blankets; grainy wood; live hair that is
Shining and free; blue-massing clouds; the keen
Unpassioned beauty of a great machine;
The benison of hot water; furs to touch;
The good smell of old clothes; and other such—
The comfortable smell of friendly fingers,
Hair's fragrance, and the musty reek that lingers
About dead leaves and last year's ferns...

So enchanting is the world of nature made vivid for us by the poets that we are ready to say with A. E. Housman in one of his little poems from The Shropshire Lad that life is too fleeting, even seventy years of it, to drink in all the beauties around us:

Loveliest of trees, the cherry now
Is hung with bloom along the bough,
And stands about the woodland ride
Wearing white for Eastertide.

Now, of my threescore years and ten, Twenty will not come again; And take from seventy springs a score, It only leaves me fifty more. And since to look at things in bloom, Fifty springs are little room. About the woodlands I will go To see the cherry hung with snow.

DISCOVERY THROUGH EXPERIENCE

Up to this point we have been exploring the excitement of discovery with the eyes and the other physical senses. We all know, however, that there are even greater kinds of discovery. Seeing at its best is more than just seeing with the eyes; even as poetry at its best begins in experience but ends in thought. Or, as Robert Frost once said it better, "A poem begins in delight but ends in wisdom." The end of a poem (a good poem, that is) is therefore not so much an ending as a beginning—as illustrated by Walt Whitman's "When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer":

When I heard the learn'd astronomer,
When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,
When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,
When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room,
How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick;
Till rising and gliding out I wandered off by myself,
In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,
Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars.

DISCOVERY THROUGH BOOKS

If seeing at its best stimulates thinking, so discovery is more than just discovery of the physical world. And one of the richest sources of discovery, as we all know, is the world of books. For the poet's testament, we turn to Emily Dickinson:

There is no frigate like a book
To take us lands away,
Nor any coursers like a page
Of prancing poetry.
This traverse may the poorest take
Without oppress of toll;
How frugal is the chariot
That bears a human soul!

More extensively, Keats also paid tribute to the exciting discoveries that may come through reading books:

On First Looking into Chapman's Homer

Much have I travelled in the realms of gold,
And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;
Round many western islands have I been
Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.
Oft of one wide expanse had I been told
That deep-brow'd Homer ruled as his demesne,
Yet did I never breathe its pure serene
Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:
Then felt I like some watcher of the skies
When a new planet swims into his ken;
Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes
He star'd at the Pacific—and all his men
Look'd at each other with a wild surmise—
Silent, upon a peak in Darien.

When Keats wrote this poem, he had never been outside England and had traveled very little within England. He had, however, traveled widely in the "realms of gold"—that is, of imagination quickened by reading. He knew the indebtedness poets felt for the great culture of ancient Greece. In particular, he had often been told that in epic poetry ("one wide expanse") Homer, author of The Iliad and The Odyssey, ruled as the supreme poet. Yet he never appreciated the greatness of Homer as an epic poet until he read an English translation by George Chapman, an Elizabethan poet and translator. Then he tingled with the excitement of a great new discovery, like an astronomer who has discovered a new planet, or like Cortez when he discovered the Pacific Ocean.

Books, great books, can do this, not only for Keats but for everyone—as millions of the world's readers can personally testify.

* If we are to know the excitement of discovery throughout our lives and not just in childhood, we must keep an enquiring mind, for curiosity is the beginning of discovery. As the great Joseph Conrad dramatized in his short story "Youth," youth is an attitude of mind more than a scarcity of years. Some people are world-weary in their teens, and others are reaching out, stretching their minds for new ideas and experiences into their eighties and nineties. There is no age at which adventure must stop, as Tennyson suggests in "Ulysses," one of the best of his short dramatic poems, but too long to print here.

* See note Balboa. In text, Section One, on DISCOVERY THROUGH PEOPLE

The world around us, waiting to be explored, consists not only of places and books, but also of people, who are more interesting and more important than all other things. One of the most beautiful statements concerning the world of people and human inter-relationships was written by the great John Donne (1572-1631) as part of his Meditation 17:

All mankind is of one author, and is one volume; when one man dies, one chapter is not torn out of the book, but translated into a better language; and every chapter must be so translated. God employs several translators; some pieces are translated by age, some by sickness, some by war, some by justice; but God's hand is in every translation, and his hand shall bind up all our tour-ific!

Lesson Department

Another man may be sick too, and sick to death, and this affliction may lie in his bowels as gold in a mine and be of no use to him; but this bell that tells me of his affliction digs out and applies that gold to me, if by this consideration of another's danger I take mine own into contemplation, and so secure myself by making my recourse to my God, who is our only security. The thought that each person is a leaf from the book of mankind that will be bound into a single harmonious volume by the loving hand of God is developed in beautifully metaphorical language. And the "no man is an island" thought is developed with at least equal beauty. Finally, the thought that affliction and tribulation are treasures and we never have enough of them until we are "matured" and "ripened" and "made fit for God" is also both beautiful and profound.

585 July 1968

Questions for discussion:
(1) What responsibilities of compassion, understanding, and helpfulness are suggested by Donne's "no man is an island" statement? How does this harmonize with our responsibilities as members of the Church, both to other members and to those outside the Church?
(2) How can we be "matured" and "ripened" and "made fit for God" by affliction and tribulation?

DISCOVERY OF TRUTH THROUGH LITERATURE

The preceding passage by John Donne illustrates another kind of discovery that we wish to emphasize in this section—the discovery of truth that literature can give. To be more accurate, the writer of literature doesn't really "discover" truth, for truth is eternal, and all of us are surrounded with it in experience and observation all our lives. The writer, however, especially the poet, puts these "truths" in rememberable phrases so that others can say, "How true! I wish I had said that."

As examples, read the two following tiny poems:

From "Grace of the Way" by Francis Thompson
Now of that vision I, bereaven,
This knowledge keep, that may not dim:
Short arm needs man to reach to Heaven,
So ready is Heaven to stoop to him.

Lesson Department "THE BURIED LIFE"
As a final search for discovery we turn to "The Buried Life" by Matthew Arnold. Although also too long to print here, a few comments on it seem desirable.
In this beautifully melancholy poem we find Arnold groping for discovery in three directions:
First, a yearning for better communication, better understanding between people. Arnold realized that even people who are very close, even people who love each other, even husbands and wives, sometimes have difficulty communicating their innermost selves.
"Alas! Is even love too weak/
To unlock the heart, and let it speak?"
he asks.
"Are even lovers powerless to reveal/
To one another what indeed they feel?"
He pleads for more understanding, more communication in complete harmony, confidence, and trust by those who love.

Second, Arnold yearns for a better understanding of self. Not only do we have trouble communicating with and understanding others, but also we have trouble understanding ourselves.
Hidden deep within each of us are the complexities of personality and the mysteries of soul.
Arnold feels keenly a need to surmount the essential loneliness of each person's isolated existence, and he realizes that the first step is to discover and know oneself. Even as it is almost impossible to know another person fully, so it is almost impossible to know oneself fully—but we need to try.

Third, Arnold expresses a groping desire to look deep within to find the ultimate meaning and nature of life itself, the "buried stream" of humanity—
"to know whence our lives come and where they go."
Arnold felt an eternalness in the flow of human life from generation to generation and from civilization to civilization even though his faith was troubled by the philosophical problems of his day.
And as he looked at the history of the world, he saw culture and religion working towards
The same end—the perfection of man.

Notes to Class Leaders: The preceding pages contain excerpts from the materials in Section One of Volume 4 of Out of the Best Books. In addition to these excerpts, the section contains fuller discussions and notes plus the following selections: an essay by Arnold Bennett showing how many people are poor observers; small poems by Tennyson, Emily Dickinson, and Bernice Burton Holmes, as further examples of the vivid observing and describing skills of the poet; "Ulysses" by Tennyson, showing how the desire for new experiences may carry through youth to maturity and old age; and, finally, a delightful little Czechoslovakian story called "People and Ants" by Peter Balgha, dramatizing that little things in the world around us are filled with interest, wonder, and deep significance, if we will just look at them—really look, that is. Fortunately, all except one of these selections in Section One are either old enough or else so brief that copyright restrictions do not prevent their being duplicated as needed for teaching. The one exception is Peter Balgha's "People and Ants." This modern story is still under copyright and may not be duplicated without special permission.

Something wonderful happens when you place a jar of your very own preserves into the hands of a friend or onto the table of those you live for. Nobody knows it better than today's creative young home-maker. And nobody knows this better than Ball: your skill-and loving care deserve two things—the perfect protection of self-sealing Ball "Dome" Lids (the ones with the nice, clean WHITE enamel lining) and the decorative beauty of Ball's newest design, "Sculptured Glass." Ask your grocer. You'll love it!
