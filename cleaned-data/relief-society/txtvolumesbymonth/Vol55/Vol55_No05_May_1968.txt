LOVE COMES ON LITTLE WINGS  
Lael W. Hill  

At the brink of four, she is wholly of the world, exactly the world's bright center, singing an earnest love:  
Oh, little bird, she sings, come down to me and let me hold you.  
She makes her hands into a tiny nest—on, lovely bird, she sings. . . .  
Oh, little butterfly, she sings, come down to me, and I will kiss you.  
Her face is flower soft and lifted skyward. Oh, pretty butterfly, she sings. . . .  
Her eyes are warm with waiting, her mouth all curved eagerness; under pink-petaled wind she stands tiptoe:  
Oh, little bird, she sings. . . .  

From Near and Far I was so glad to see my picture in The Relief Society Magazine (hobby feature, January 1968). The sisters in the Fourth Ward were so thrilled over it. They said it lifted their hearts to have this representation. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  
Mrs. Mabel Lords, Pocatello, Idaho  

The Relief Society Magazine is awaited with eager anticipation each month. The stories, poems, editorials, in fact, the whole Magazine is an inspiration. Our children and their little friends enjoyed immensely the gingerbread house made from directions in the December issue ("A House of Many Roofs," by Berta Mae C. Peek), and they could hardly wait until they were given permission to eat "the house."  
M. Jean Baty, Selkirk, Manitoba, Canada  

Thank you for the inspiring Magazine. My husband took sick on Christmas night, and has been on the critical list. The Magazine has given me such a great spiritual peace and comfort. I am of Spanish descent, from a Catholic family. My sister and I are the only members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, from our family. Our feelings are mutual when we say the gospel is true. I am grateful for the calling I have in Relief Society, as first counselor, for the beautiful lessons, and for the features in the Magazine. The Magazine is full of treasures.  
Mrs. Zanie L. Sears, Stafford, Virginia  

The real worth of the Magazine lies in the enrichment it offers, from the exquisite cover to the last article. Its poems enhance sacred and common themes in words of beauty, while its stories provide genuine enjoyment. Menu and handicraft suggestions add variety to daily living.  
Arvilla J. Workman, Hinckley, Utah  

I am very pleased with the artwork for my serial "Throw Down the Gauntlet" (concluded in April 1968). It's such fun to see someone else's concepts of my own mental pictures.  
Janet Breeze, Silver Spring, Maryland  

I was very happy to see my tablecloth displayed so beautifully in the December Magazine (pages 922-923). It will be an issue especially treasured in our home. Maxine (Maxine Curtis, who wrote the article) was here for the holidays. We were both interested in all the other colorful displays. It was truly a splendid Christmas issue.  
Blanche T. Miner, Salt Lake City, Utah  

I have been edified with some of the reactions of the readers of our Magazine. Said one "I want to stand around . . . waiting to see how the story ends. I simply save all the Magazines until the story is finished." And then there was a certain discriminatory lady, frail and refined, who said to me that each chapter of a serial in the Magazine leaves her cheated, because each chapter is too brief. "It is like nibbling the edge of a cookie, when I am hungry for the whole cookie." I am proud of our beautiful Magazine.

Mary R. Young Member, General Board of Relief Society = She was just a little girl—much too young to make important decisions and, yet, she wanted to be heard from during the family home evening hour. As this incident was told to me, this young child first expressed the desire to be a schoolteacher when she grew up, then she changed her mind and said she wanted to be a nurse; then, looking fondly over at her mother, she said, "No, I have decided I want to be just like mother—nothing!" She meant her mother had not followed a career as a teacher or a nurse, she was just a wonderful mother and homemaker. What a lovely compliment to pay her mother, to want to be like her. I feel honored and complimented when a person says, "You remind me of your mother." I remember how delighted my mother was when friends told her she resembled her mother in many ways. I will be eternally grateful for the guidance and teachings of a good mother; for her strength of character; for the example she set by living the principles of the gospel; for her great courage, faith, and honesty, her deep reverence for the priesthood and desire to sustain and follow the counsel of the Authorities and prophets of the Lord. My mother, Mary Romney Ross, lovingly called Aunt Mamie by her nieces and nephews, was both mother and father to her five children. My father, George John Ross, was killed in 1908, in what was believed to be the first fatal automobile accident in the State of Utah. My youngest brother Charles was born some months after the accident, so mother had five young children to rear alone. She always said her Heavenly Father blessed her with added strength and health to carry out her many responsibilities as a widow for fifty-four years. Some of my earliest recollections and memories of home were those of hearing mother sing. She had a beautiful soprano voice. I would sit and listen to her practice a solo she was preparing to sing at church; or she and her friends would practice duets or quartets to sing at funerals. It was such fun to hear them make their plans. As children, we enjoyed hearing mother tell us about her childhood, how Brother C. R. Savage called her "little canary" when she sang as a very young girl. How thrilling it was to sing in the Tabernacle when Utah was made a State, and then, with great feeling, she would relate the impressive occasion of singing with the Tabernacle Choir at the dedication of the Salt Lake Temple. With a song in her heart, and with this gift of singing, it naturally brought joy and happiness not only into her life but also into her home, and was an influence for good in the lives of her children. Mother was a very spiritual woman. Her values were lasting ones, eternal values. She taught us to put first things first. Her motto was, "... Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you." (Matthew 6:33.) She would get her five little ones around her and we would pray together as a family. We attended Sunday School and sacrament meeting together as a family. Well do I remember one Sunday evening we could not find my brother George, so we went to church without him, and when we returned found out he had been playing baseball with the boys, and his ball had crashed through the large living-room window of our neighbor's house. Mother made the most of that teaching moment and explained fully the real meaning of keeping the Sabbath Day holy, and I am quite sure my brother never stayed away from church to play ball again. "Cleanliness is next to Godliness." This was another of mother's favorite expressions. She was extremely orderly and an immaculate housekeeper. She was always neat and clean in her appearance. Her hair was lovely, and she took a great deal of pride in dressing and looking nice. She held her head high with the majesty of a queen, receiving respect and love from all who knew her. She was proud of her heritage, proud of her membership in the Church, and grateful that she was able to render service. She was active in the various organizations of the Church from early childhood. I am grateful that we were taught economy in our home. This proved to be valuable training for me when I was first married and lived in the East while my husband attended law school. Mother had a very meager income after my father died, but she had a deep conviction that if she paid her tithing, was thrifty and frugal, she could manage, and it was more important for her to stay at home with her children than to get a job and supplement her income. She taught each child to share and accept responsibility. She was truly a wonderful manager, and we were taught that happiness does not depend upon how much money one has to spend but how wisely it is used. She would never think of beginning a winter without a year's supply of coal and wood on hand. I recall seeing many fifty-pound sacks of flour stacked high on shelves made for that purpose. The vegetable cellar was usually bulging with potatoes, onions, and apples. This was the way many people lived at that time. It was a safe, secure way of life; an example of living we well might emulate and follow today, as suggested by the Authorities of the Church in our Welfare Plan. Times, situations, and problems are different now than they were then, but certain basic principles and truths remain the same, such as taking care of what we have and living within one's income. In mother's early life she learned that in work there is dignity and satisfaction, stressing the necessity of effort along with work, that anything worth doing is worth doing well. She believed in the statement found in the Doctrine and Covenants, Section 42:42: Thou shalt not be idle; for he that is idle shall not eat the bread nor wear the garments of the laborer. Working long hours was necessary for her to accomplish her many household duties. The smell of freshly baked bread and hot biscuits, baked regularly three times each week, still lingers in my memory, also the tantalizing aroma of chili sauce cooking on the stove in the fall of the year, as we were starting back to school. The spicy smell of delicious pickled peaches, ready to be put in a large earthen crock, and then, of course, her famous mustard pickles had to be made each year, so she could share them with her neighbors. Mother seemed to find joy and satisfaction in working, in keeping busy. Her life was not all sunshine and song, however, as she often remarked, her life was one of tears and smiles.

She not only lost her husband, but also two teenage daughters died within the short space of eighteen months. Some years later, one son died as a result of an automobile accident very similar to his father's. These trials seemed to draw her closer to her Heavenly Father and made her stronger. There was never any complaining or wavering in her faith. A poet once wrote: "Sweet are the uses of adversity." These words applied to my mother, because she rose above her tragedies and, through great faith, was able to build something beautiful, strong, and radiant out of adversity.

Continuing down memory lane, includes fond memories of my Grandmother Romney. My mother's parents were Vilate Ellen Douglas and George Romney, both sturdy, courageous pioneers. Grandfather bore a fervent, powerful testimony till the time of his death that he knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that Joseph Smith was a true prophet of God. He had known the Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum—had heard them speak, and was in attendance at the meeting in Nauvoo when the mantle of Joseph Smith fell on Brigham Young. Grandfather left Nauvoo and came West in 1850. Grandmother was just ten years of age at the time she came West with her family. Their fine traits of character were instilled into their children, and mother was always grateful and thankful to her parents for the training and influence they had on her life.

Grandmother Romney was the mother of twelve children, six boys and six girls. Grandfather was the bishop of the Twentieth Ward for twenty-four years or more, and Grandmother was a real mother to the ward during that period, helping to care for the sick, the needy, and the widows. She was always on hand when a new baby arrived, ready and able to assist the mother and help with the other children. I always thought of Grandmother as a cultured, refined, kind, and gentle lady. She made a tremendous impression on me down memory lane when I was a child and truly touched and influenced my life, for which I am indebted and will always be grateful.

Grandmother and Grandfather were especially close to our family because of mother being left a widow at such a young age. In fact, we were at their home a great deal. I remember spending every Christmas there as long as they lived. What wonderful times and delicious dinners we did enjoy! One of my fondest memories is the time when I lived with my grandparents for a month when my own family was quarantined for scarlet fever. I had been stricken with the same disease a few years before this time, so was allowed to continue in school if I lived away from home. My grandparents showered me with love and kindness, spoiled me, I am sure, as grandparents do, and made me feel like a queen, not just for a day, but for the entire month.

When grandmother had me sleep in bed with her because she was concerned for fear I might be lonely or homesick, I remember trying to lie in bed just as still as I possibly could, not even turning over, for fear I would keep her awake. How I loved to listen to Grandmother tell me about the early days when Grandfather was sent on a mission to England and to hear her chuckle as she recalled making so many pies, then selling them to support her children while he was away. Getting to know them so intimately was indeed a choice experience.

Truly, I was blessed when I think of the influence my grandmother had on my early life; also, when I realize the training my own mother gave me when I was young and the influence she had on my later life, I was thrice blessed. When we were rearing our family, mother visited us often, usually accompanied us on our family outings, had Sunday dinners with us, and always brightened our home with her vibrant personality and zest for living until she was over ninety years of age.

Richard L. Evans appropriately expressed my sentiments when he said: "Thank God for mothers, you who have them. And you who have not now, thank him for such a mother to remember. And you, the young mothers who have children yet around you, God grant that you may give them such love, such memories to remember."

Mother passed away just two weeks before reaching her ninety-third birthday. She spent the last three years of her life living with us in our home. She had always been so independent, so used to doing for herself, it was very difficult for her to adjust to this new way of life. She hadn't been accustomed to being inactive. She didn't enjoy sitting around having someone wait on her. She did, however, enjoy very much having our nineteen grandchildren (her great-grandchildren) around when they so often visited. She told them many wonderful stories of her early life and they loved to hear them.

The lives of these great-grandchildren have been touched and influenced by her fine traits of character, her words of wisdom, her sound judgment, and years of experience. Now, as a family, we all have these precious memories and deeply cherish them. May each one of us live our lives so that our children and grandchildren will carry with them precious and cherished memories as they walk down memory lane.

R TO A WHITE PEONY
Was it yesterday this pierced The tomb of earth, snow-cooled and dark, And thrust a sharp, blood-red dart Past stones and stubble to the light?
Today, I hold the fresh-blown, fringed Peony in my hand, and mark Streaks of crimson at its heart, Deep against the full-flowered white, And marvel at the miracle: A dry brown bulb, grown beautiful.
—Mabel Jones Gabbott

THE BEAUTIFUL HOUR
Is hour I love, for it brings peace Evening's solitude is balm to ease For my heart's rest. Etched against a rose red sky A bird wings slowly to the west: Evening breezes wake and bring Fragrance from the mountain crest. The day's fast bustle, too, is gone— Stillness attends with beauty rare; Nature is close and manifest— She offers me her care.
—Annie C. Esplin

A Lael J. Littke
Janet felt ill at ease in the group of chattering young women. They all seemed to know one another so well, and they talked of Broadway shows which she had not seen, and of big department stores whose names she recognized but which she had not visited. She almost wished she had not come. Yet, she was anxious to be friends with her new neighbors and had been pleased when Norma, who lived next door, invited her to join this group.
"You'll love the girls," Norma had said. "We call ourselves 'The Neighborhood Club.' One morning a month we hire a sitter for our preschool children and get together to do something interesting. It's to be at my house this month."

"You will come, won't you?" "Of course I will," Janet had said, although she wondered if she really had time since her new job as second counselor in the ward Primary promised to take care of any spare moments left over from caring for Dale and their four children. Still, joining the group would be an opportunity to meet some of the other young women who lived nearby. Now, sitting there, Janet wondered if she could ever fit in with the group. She was relieved when Norma clapped her hands to call a halt to the chatter. "Girls," Norma said as soon as the noise subsided, "I want you all to meet Janet Nelson who recently moved into Sally Mason's house." "I hope she and Sally get along well," said the girl sitting next to Janet, who had introduced herself earlier as Carolyn Symons. Everyone laughed. "You'll have to get used to that," Norma said. "The Masons lived there for a long time, so I guess it will take us a while to stop calling it Sally Mason's house." "That's all right," Janet said, "as long as you don't call me Sally." The girls laughed again, and Janet began to relax. They seemed just as friendly as the girls at church, she thought. She wondered why she had thought they would be different. Probably because until she and Dale and the children moved here she had lived her entire life in a beautiful western valley where almost everyone she knew shared her own convictions. She had been fearful about moving to a new environment where she would be surrounded by people who thought, and even spoke, differently, but Dale had wanted very much to take advantage of the fine opportunity his company offered him if he would move to New York, so she had agreed. The children, and Dale, too, had readily made new friends in the pleasant suburb where they bought a house, but Janet, with all the problems of getting settled, had not yet had much chance to get acquainted. Norma was clapping her hands again. "Girls," she said. "I've asked Ann Croyden to come today to tell us about her adventures in Japan while gathering material for her new book, but she has The Happy Homemaker been delayed, so you can go ahead and talk until she arrives." Carolyn sighed. "Now there is a woman I really envy," she said. "Ann Croyden is free as a bird—not tied down to a house and children as we poor drudges are." "Carolyn, here, is our career-girl type," Norma said. "Left a wonderful job as a junior editor in a publishing house to rear a family." "And I've regretted it ever since," Carolyn said with a wry grin. Janet knew some sort of startled expression registered on her face, because Carolyn said hastily, "Don't get me wrong. I love my two children. But if it weren't for my husband's insisting that I stay home until they are both in school, I would be back at that job tomorrow. I get so sick and tired of cooking and cleaning and saying nothing more intelligent all day than 'Put on your shoes.' Being a housewife is such an unrewarding, uncreative job." "Oh, I disagree," Janet said, surprised at herself for speaking so forcefully. "Oh?" Carolyn said, with an amused smile. "Tell us more." Janet's face flushed as she felt all eyes upon her. She swallowed and went on valiantly. "It's just that I don't think it has to be uncreative and unrewarding. In the first place, I like to call myself a 'homemaker.' Adds a little dignity, don't you think?" She smiled brightly at the assembled girls and was reassured to see answering smiles on several faces. "What is any more creative than making a lovely home?" she went on. "You can use any talent you have to help make it a place you and your husband and children will enjoy and be proud of. And I don't think there is anything more creative and rewarding than teaching and guiding your children and watching them develop. As for cooking, it can be as creative as you make it, and even cleaning is not so bad if you approach it right." Carolyn was watching her with something very close to scorn on her face. "Well, if it isn't Little Mrs. Sunshine herself," she said softly. There was a titter from somewhere in the otherwise quiet room. Janet could feel her face flaming. "Oh, I don't mean it's all roses," she said. "There are times when I would like to get away for awhile, and other times when I yearn to get back into teaching. Maybe I will when my family is grown. But right now I wouldn't trade my very important and satisfying role of being a homemaker for any other job in the world." Janet looked hopefully around the room, waiting for someone to say, "That's right," or "I feel the same way." But no one spoke until Carolyn shrugged and said, "Every woman to her own tastes." Janet was thankful that Ann Croyden arrived just then. In the ensuing bustle everyone else seemed to have forgotten the little exchange between her and Carolyn, but it burned bright in Janet's mind. Why had she spoken so strongly? She had branded herself as such a domestic little homebody that certainly these more sophisticated young women would want nothing further to do with her. Perhaps she had been right in the first place. Perhaps they were different. Or was it she who was different? She didn't hear much of Ann Croyden's lecture. She decided she would stay after the meeting and tell Norma that she didn't think she could come any more. But after the other girls had gone, murmuring polite things such as "Nice to have you in the club, Janet," it was Norma who spoke first. "You'll get used to Carolyn, Janet," she said. "She's really very nice, but she does have a sharp tongue." "I'm sorry I made a fool of myself," Janet said. Norma shook her head. "You didn't. We have all had tiffs with Carolyn. Actually, most of us agree with you, but I guess no one spoke up because we didn't want to get Carolyn started on her favorite subject—the downtrodden housewife." Norma paused to smile, then went on. "I guess there is a little of Carolyn in all of us, but for the most part we are a pretty happy bunch." Janet had the feeling that she and Norma would become very good friends. "You don't know how much better you have made me feel," she said. "I'm sure you will like our group,' Norma said, "and I'm sure they like you. Carolyn may needle you for awhile, but try not to let it bother you." But it did bother Janet, especially when Carolyn started calling her "The Happy Homemaker" whenever they met. "Well, how is the Happy Homemaker today," she asked when they ran into each other in the supermarket.

At the next meeting of the Neighborhood Club, she said, "Let's have a happy thought for the day from our Happy Homemaker." Each time Janet just smiled, although she felt distinctly uncomfortable. If it hadn't been for the friendliness of the other girls, she would have withdrawn from the club. One day she caught a glimpse of the inner Carolyn, and it made her hopeful that they might eventually become friends. Carolyn came over to get her daughter, Peggy, who had become the very best friend of Janet's Karen. Janet was making cookies with the enthusiastic but messy help of the two four-year-old girls. "Peggy," Carolyn said as Janet invited her into the kitchen, "what a mess you're making." "That's all right," Janet said. "We are all having fun doing it." "Mama," Peggy said, "I made this my very own self." With great pride she held up a mangled cookie. "How nice," Carolyn said. "If you stay around here long enough maybe you'll learn something useful." She watched as Peggy and Karen rolled and cut more cookies. "Why don't you roll out a few?" Janet invited, offering a rolling pin. "T really have to get home and thaw out some dinner for Jack," Carolyn said. "Besides, I'm all thumbs when it comes to baking. My mother taught me how to handle sculptor's clay, but we never did get around to cookie dough." Her tone was almost wistful. "It's easy," Janet said, handing The Happy Homemaker her a piece of dough. "Just try it." So, for the next half hour, until Carolyn remembered she should be home "thawing out dinner," she rolled and cut fancy-shaped cookies. Janet felt strongly that the episode might have established some basis for understanding between them, but a week later, at the next meeting of the Neighborhood Club, she was again scorched by Carolyn's caustic tongue. "What is the latest goody from the oven of the Happy Homemaker?" Carolyn asked as Janet arrived. Janet smiled at her. "As a matter of fact, I just took a batch of bread from the oven." "Such thrift," Carolyn murmured. "I don't do it all the time," Janet replied, wishing that she didn't always feel so apologetic around Carolyn. "But this morning I wanted to try out a recipe I learned at Relief Society." "At where?" Carolyn said, obviously amused. Janet wished she hadn't mentioned Relief Society. Carolyn was sure to make some sarcastic remark about it. Well, Janet just wouldn't give her the chance. It was about time she stopped being defensive about her life. "At Relief Society," she repeated cheerfully, then went on to explain a little about what it was. "I wish you would all come with me to a meeting some day. You would be surprised what you can learn there. Why, you might even learn to quilt." "Quilt?" said Marcie Edwards. "T thought that went out with great-grandma." 333 May 1968 "It's fun," Janet insisted. Then, on an impulse, she added, "Let me be the hostess at our next meeting and we'll have an old-fashioned quilting bee." "Sounds fun," Norma said. "That's something we certainly haven't done before." "For an encore we'll make lye soap," Carolyn said. Despite Carolyn's sarcasm, Janet was happy as she made the preparations for the quilting bee. She asked Sister Thompson, an elderly widow in the ward, if she would come over and teach the girls to quilt. Sister Thompson was thrilled to be of service. "Let's piece a Texas Star," she said. "No, let's make it something simple so they will feel free to make mistakes." Happily she set to work, with Janet's frequent help, to put together a colorful top. On the day before the meeting she brought the complete top and her frames to Janet's house to set them up. "T'm really looking forward to this," she said. "So am I," said Janet. She planned to make it as much as possible like the quilting bees her mother had sometimes held. For lunch she was going to serve fried chicken and fresh-baked bread, as her mother had done. It was while she was at the supermarket purchasing chickens that she heard her name mentioned from the other side of a canned foods shelf. "Are you going to the meeting at Janet's tomorrow?" The voice was Norma's. The answering voice was unmistakably Carolyn's. "I guess I'll go, just for laughs. A quilting bee—can you imagine?" Norma spoke again. "She's such a quaint little thing." Quaint! So that's what they thought of her. Quaint. Old-fashioned. Peculiar. Strictly for laughs. She had known from the very first that she didn't fit in with that group. She would never be anything more to them than the quaint little thing who lived in Sally Mason's house. Quickly Janet paid for her chickens and left the store. She wanted to go home and hide. She would call all the girls and say she was ill and couldn't hold the meeting. But when she got home and saw all the preparations Sister Thompson had made, she knew she would have to go through with it. She forced herself to be cordial the next morning as the girls arrived. They squealed with pleasure over the pretty quilt top, and under Sister Thompson's direction they began to sew with enthusiasm. Janet waited for Carolyn's inevitable sarcasm, but it didn't come. In fact, Carolyn was strangely subdued as she sat there stitching the bright squares. However, everyone else was talkative. "Isn't this fun," said Marcie Edwards, "to have a meeting where we can do something and talk, too?" "Sit down and sew with us," Norma said. "You've been working in that kitchen all morning." "Can't now," Janet said. "I'm all ready to serve lunch." The lunch received even higher compliments than the quilt. "Oh, my diet," moaned Eva Rankin. "But I don't care." She took another slice of bread. Even Carolyn was complimentary. "Every home should smell of fresh-baked bread," she said. The girls stayed on until it was time for their children to come from school. "Let's do it again sometime," Marcie Edwards said as she went out of the door. "I'd like to make a quilt for my boy's bed." Carolyn was still quiet as she left, but she thanked Janet politely. Norma was more effusive. "It's so wonderful to have you with us," she said, giving Janet a little hug. "You're such a quaint little thing, and so refreshing to have around." Quaint again. Janet knew now that it was a compliment. She returned Norma's hug, and smiled happily after the departing girls. The quilting bee had been a success, and Carolyn had not made a single sarcastic remark. At least not yet. The Happy Homemaker It was several days later that Carolyn came by and asked if she could come in and talk for a few minutes. Surprised, Janet said, "Certainly. Come on into the kitchen. I always seem to be baking when you come. Today it's pies." "T like being in your kitchen," Carolyn said. "It seems so cozy." Janet smiled.

My mother always said the kitchen is the heart of the home. "In my home it's been a pretty cold heart," Carolyn said thoughtfully. "But after your quilting bee the other day, I went home and baked some cookies. Thought I would see if I could make my house smell as homey as yours. I let Peggy and David help. We were still at it when Jack came home, and he joined right in. I don't know when we have felt so close, so much like a family. We almost starved before we finally got around to thawing our dinner. Davie asked why couldn't we do something like that more often, so we have."

May 1968

Janet opened her mouth to say something, but Carolyn held up her hand. "Let me finish before I start blubbering or something. Anyway, it is gradually dawning on me how precious my family is and how much we can enjoy each other. Those first cookies weren't very good—although the children thought they were wonderful—but I'll keep trying. You know, Janet, I may even turn into a 'Happy Homemaker.'"

Janet said, laughing. Carolyn's face reddened just a little, but she grinned. "Exactly. Oh, I'll still probably go back to work in a year or two, but maybe in the meantime I can begin to establish the kind of home I would like my children to remember. I think things started coming clear at your quilting bee."

Janet was surprised. Quilting bee?" Carolyn nodded. "I came prepared to be sarcastic about it, but somehow, when we got started, 'The it seemed like such a womanly thing to be doing, the sort of thing our great-grandmothers did back in the days when they created homes out of the wilderness. Your home has that same kind of warmth and welcoming hominess that I imagine theirs had. But there is something more than that. A lot of the warmth comes from you yourself—some inner contentment or serenity that even my sarcasm couldn't reach. What is it, Janet, that makes your life so different from mine?"

Suddenly Janet was terribly grateful that events had brought her to this place and into contact with this young woman. Silently she prayed that she might say the right things.

"Carolyn," she began, "in order to start answering your question, I'm going to ask you two questions. We call them 'The Golden Questions.'"

MAY IS THE MONTH

May is the month
One thinks of children
For they, too, are a prelude
To summer.
They are down-young and
Soft to the touch;
Pink to the rejuvenating eye.

One sees Maypoles being braided;
And bare toes curling in sand,
Damp at the shore, warm
In the wide roads of youth.

One sees oneself—
As a child again
Climbing into the apple boughs;
Walking the paths, threaded
Between poplars, arching over
Quibbling-voiced stream waters.
One feels warmth returning
Like breath, like life itself
Reaching its fulfillment.

May is the month
One thinks of children,
And becomes a child again.

The Future of Relief Society

The annual report for Relief Society published in the April issue of the Magazine reveals, through impressive figures, the present strength of the Society—its great size, its wide geographic scope, its vast humanitarian services, the extent of its educational activities, the volume of its leadership.

As we ponder the growth, the influence, and power of Relief Society today, we marvel at what has been achieved in a period of a little more than one and one-quarter centuries. It is but natural that we should ask, "What will it be in another hundred years? Can its rate of growth be maintained? Can it extend itself into ever-widening areas of service? Can it continue to function on an ever-enlarging scale in harmony with its original purposes and procedures?"

It is but natural for us to ask, "Can the women of the Church keep pace with the growth and expansion of the Society and maintain the same high standards of performance? What is the future of Relief Society?"

What will it be tomorrow?" It is true, generally speaking, that women's organizations do not persist over long periods of time. They are founded in the interest of some specific cause or have some special purpose. When the goals for which they were created are realized, they then slowly disintegrate, die out, or are dissolved, since the need for them no longer exists. This will not be so with Relief Society. Time will not erase the need for it, nor will the purposes for which it was established cease to exist. Its goals are of an eternal nature; its founding and its mission are according to God's will.

Relief Society is the great women's organization of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints—a companion organization to the priesthood. Where there is an organized ward or branch of the Church with a readiness for a Relief Society, there we find a priesthood-organized Society. This has been so since the day when, through revelation from the Lord, the Prophet Joseph Smith organized the sisters, calling their society "The Female Relief Society of Nauvoo."

Societies will continue in the years ahead to be organized wherever there is a ward or branch of the Church. President Joseph F. Smith has said: The Kingdom of God is here to grow, to spread abroad, to take root in the earth, and to abide where the Lord has planted it by his own power and his own word in the earth, never more to be destroyed nor to cease, but to continue until the purposes of the Almighty shall be accomplished. The Kingdom of God and the work of the Lord will spread more and more; it will progress more rapidly in the world in the future than it has done in the past. The Lord has said it, and the Spirit beareth record. (Gospel Doctrine, page 92.)

As the work of the Lord progresses in accordance with the predictions of his prophets, the work of Relief Society, also, will progress for, indeed, Relief Society is the medium through which the organized work to be performed by women for the Church is to be done. Relief Society is established upon principles of truth and righteousness. It is priesthood directed. It will not disintegrate, die out, nor be dissolved. Its purposes will endure. It will continue to function in behalf of womankind and the Church until the Lord shall say of it, "Its work is accomplished."

Nor do we need to fear that the sisters of tomorrow will not be equal to the increased tasks. The Lord will raise up great women leaders and qualify them for the work. He will reveal, through his prophets, the ways whereby the growing and expanding work may be accomplished.

Those of us who stand today among that select body of women who make up the Relief Society membership have just cause to rejoice in the blessings that have given us our present strength. Let us also rejoice in the knowledge that we have a part in the glorious and enduring future of Relief Society. The strength of our testimonies, the quality of our service, the example of our lives, the convictions of the divine mission of Relief Society which we pass on to our children, will be firm stepping stones on which sisters of tomorrow may walk in advancing the work and meeting its every requirement.

General Board members and sisters throughout the Church regret the resignation of Cleone Rich Eccles from the General Board, as of February 21, 1968. She has served on the General Board since January 15, 1964. During this time she rendered outstanding service to Relief Society. She has ably served on the Music Committee, where her own musical talents and her liberal educational background rendered her contribution of great worth. She was chairman of the Special Programs Committee at the time of her resignation. In addition, she has fulfilled many speaking engagements and served at conferences both at home and abroad where her sweet, refined presence and wise counsel have been greatly appreciated.

Sister Eccles came to the General Board after having served in many responsible stake and ward positions in Relief Society and other auxiliaries of the Church. She possesses a great capacity for sympathetic understanding, stemming partly from her experiences of rearing a family of six children. She herself was reared in a family where Relief Society was held in highest regard, as her mother served as president of Mount Ogden Stake Relief Society for twenty-three years.

The united love of the board goes with Sister Eccles. Her service to Relief Society will stand as a memorial to her in the faithful service she has rendered. On behalf of all Relief Society sisters, love and appreciation are extended to Sister Eccles. May she find much happiness in her future endeavors, and may Relief Society continue to be a joy and a fulfillment to her.

Reflections on Being a Home Mother
Josephine H. Beck
A home mother is what I call myself, because that is what I am striving to be—a mother at home. I'm a mother with precious memories of a mother who was always home when I came home.

Always, I could look back and wave goodbye to her as I went forth to perform my daily tasks. Whenever I needed comfort or reassurance, she was there, and I never went away "heart-hungry." Time or loss of taste could never dim my memory of wonderful fragrant bread baking, or the aroma of chili sauce on the autumn air. So that is what I choose to be—a home mother, and I sincerely hope my children, in their every need, will find me available when they need my help or encouragement in these trying days of growing up.

MAIL BOX (RFD)

In summer, it seems, they always loiter long.... A rose to pick—the bridge to cross—a sunset's glow. But in wintertime their pace is fleet and swift. What fun to run the length of lane in drifted snow! And oh, the thrill to find the waiting letter there— The Christmas card, the valentine, a child's first scrawl. And always, always the words most waited for: 'We are all just fine.' 'We miss you so.' 'God bless you all.'

Alda L. Brown

341 Amy Giles Bond

My dear daughter, you say you can't understand why the Lord has sent so much illness, heartache, and sorrow into my life. With the help of the Lord I shall try to give you my answer to your question. I won't say I haven't asked myself this same question, because I have asked it many times.

As I understand it, life was never meant to be filled with only good things and good happenings. We were sent into this world to taste the bitter to know the sweet; if we only tasted the sweet, how could we really appreciate it unless we have partaken of some bitterness? There are some days that come along that are so filled with sorrow and heartache we feel we won't be able to accept them. These experiences are similar to the darkness of night, but before long we see the rosy light of dawn as darkness turns into light.

It is when light returns that we know we have passed through another period in our preparation to return to our Father in heaven. How we accepted and reacted to the experience just passed through will determine how well we are preparing ourselves for the greatest of all experiences. These things we are called upon to bear are not sent to us by way of punishment by the Lord, but to give us greater strength to overcome all things; where much is given, in knowledge or anything else, much more is expected of us, and the way was never meant to be easy.

Each day I pray for strength to accept and face whatever may come that day, and, dear, if we have faith, the Lord does bless us with an inner strength to help us when we feel we can bear no more. The fact that I have been called upon to suffer a great deal physically bothers you also, and you say you don't think a just God would do this to me. I hope I can impart to you my feelings concerning this.

There have been times that I, too, have asked why, but I think I know the answer. Each time I have been ill some good has come from it; I have learned something new about life that I never knew before or sometimes even understood. Through illness, I have gained a greater insight into the lives and feelings of others. I have learned to have sympathy, compassion, and empathy. Life itself has taken on new meaning for me.

I am learning to choose the important things and not to clutter up my life with things that don't really matter, such as false pride and trying to keep up with the Joneses. There was a time when these meant quite a bit to me, but I have re-evaluated so many things. I still have to overcome being overanxious and must still learn to be more patient. Being ill so much has opened up new avenues of self-expression for me, and for this I am truly grateful.

And despite all the illness, pain, and difficulties that may have been my lot, I have gained two very important things, and they are my trust and faith in God's goodness to me and mine. I am truly blest, and if I do nothing more in life than instill in you a desire to find for yourself the truth of these things, I shall not have lived in vain.

YOUR LOVING MOTHER

Spring 43 A

I tell you, sister, stop your fear: Look out and see that spring is here:

The birds are building nests again,
And blossoms glisten in the rain
That May drops gently on the land.
And be not afraid, come, hold my hand;
We two are old, we had our spring,
For us nightingales did once sing,
We plucked the rose that for us grew,
We sipped the lily's morning-dew.

On we took of life what we liked best,
Now comes the time for us to rest.
We're links in God's eternal chain,
We go to sleep, but wake again
When we are called—so do not fear
And just be glad that spring is here.

Or

For Elizabeth Loefler Sale, Cheshire, England.

When I started attending Relief Society meetings less than a year ago, it was at the urging of a friend and neighbor who is an active member of the Church. I didn't think that I would be the "type" that would fit into a ladies' Church group, and pictured Relief Society as a group of older women sitting around putting fruit in baskets for the sick and needy. Most of you realize from that statement that I was not a member of the Church. I am still not a baptized member, but I hope that soon, even that will be changed.

My first experience with Relief Society was an awakening. I found friendship with the sisters, fellowship with the sisters, and more important, I found out that my Heavenly Father had indeed given the sisterhood of this Church something wonderful.

As time passed, I became a frequent, in fact, a regular visitor at the meetings. Strange things began to happen to my life—I started considering things that I had never given much thought to before. I was a person who didn't care for being domestic. I hated to cook, and I hated to sew, and most of all, I hated to clean house. It didn't bother me that my husband would have preferred a good cook and a clean house—I wasn't cut out of that mold, and he would just have to accept that.

Thanks to Relief Society, the lessons, and the put-into-action examples I saw there, a drastic change has taken place.

One day a sister showed us a coat she had made from an old coat she had bought for fifty cents. I was absolutely amazed to think that things like that were being done in this day and age. I went home that day and thought about what I had seen and heard in that meeting and decided that I would try sewing. I bought the material and made 344 Relief Society - an Awakening my baby a dress, a coat, and hat for Easter. What a thrilling experience to know that I could create, with my own hands, something of value! I never felt such pride, and when I showed my husband the coat, the admiration in his eyes was something I will never forget.

At another meeting, my life changed in a different way. We had a talk on home food storage, and canning was discussed at some length. Here were women—modern, well-dressed, well-educated women talking about the ancient art of canning. I thought, that is not for me, but the more I listened, the more I realized that if I were to carry out the home food storage plan I would have to can. I didn't do any canning this season, but I did make forty pints of jam, and believe me, that was an accomplishment! Next year I will add some canning to my growing list of domestic talents.

I still don't enjoy cleaning house, but I can honestly say that I am trying harder and doing a better job, and I am taking more pride in my home each day. I've found that as I take more pride in my home and the things connected with it, my husband takes considerable more pride in me. I owe this new fulfillment and enrichment of my life to Relief Society.

When I go each week and see women learning to be women, and mothers learning to be mothers, and wives learning to be wives and applying what they learn to their daily lives, I thank my Heavenly Father that I was fortunate enough to be given the opportunity of sharing in this wonderful plan. For the first time in my life, I have a purpose and I feel that through my activities in Relief Society, I am doing some small part to see that God's plans are carried out in the way that he would want them to be.

The things I have learned about the gospel and the specific teachings of the Church have helped me immeasurably in my life, and the patience and understanding that are facts of life with the sisters of Relief Society are becoming facts of life in our home. I have far to travel, and much to learn, but through this great Church and this wonderful organization I have made a beginning.

White syringa clusters reach
Toward an azure sky,
Wafting orange blossom scent
On zephyrs passing by.
Nostalgic scene of bridal white
"Something new, or blue,"
Stirs my heart with happiness,
Turns my thoughts to you.

Loveliness is memory filled—
White syringa—perfume spilled.

It was a windy March morning as Clare Hopkins slowly walked into the house, going from room to room, remembering times in the past. Even though on the farm, she might as well get used to the idea. Supper would be late that night, as Rob had to go into town.

The sun's fading rays cast weird shadows in the living room. Clare shivered and pulled her sweater more tightly about her. Lately, she had not been able to still the growing feeling of discontentment within her. She had prayed about the strange feeling of uneasiness and discontent that was taking hold of her; she had gone to her Church meetings faithfully, but she could not find the answer.

Thinking back over their life together, she knew Rob had been a devoted husband, kind and considerate, never once taking her for granted. Why did she feel this way? Also, this past week there had been the dreams. They were almost identical in content. Night after night, she would dream that she was in a garden, and it was beautiful and green with a little stream running close by. There were flowers growing about, and the sight was breathtaking. But, most disturbing to her, were the happy voices, the sounds of children laughing and playing. And then suddenly they were all around her, calling her "Mother."

Clare would awaken with a start, and the darkness would seem terrible and bleak.

Clare walked listlessly from room to room, tidying things as she went. She paused in front of her dressing table mirror. Her reflection stared back at her, dull and uncaring. The years had not dimmed the delicate brunette beauty, although her hair was well flecked with gray. Her eyes still had the same gentleness, and her skin was softly lined.

Rob's pick-up truck pulled to a halt in the driveway, and Clare went to the door to meet him.

Hand in Hand

"For a minute I didn't think you were home. What are you doing sitting in the dark?" Rob smiled affectionately at his wife. Clare responded, trying to make her voice sound light. "I was enjoying sitting in the dark. I am afraid I haven't even started supper as yet, dear. I know that you are hungry."

"That's fine, dear. Take your time. I think that I would like to read the paper first, anyway. Oh, by the way, I see that someone is living on the old Carlson farm. I understand that their daughter Midge and her husband Ralph Blake have come back and plan to live there. That means that we will have some close neighbors again after all this time."

"I wonder why they came back here. I thought that she enjoyed living in the city." Clare was surprised. "I have never met her. She got married and moved away from home before the Carlsons bought the farm. I imagine it will be quite an adjustment for her."

"Talk around town is that they wanted to rear their family in the country. Her husband will commute back and forth to work." Rob picked up the paper. "We should pay them a visit very soon and make them welcome."

A stinging feeling went through Clare, as though a knife were piercing her heart. After all this time, whenever she heard anyone speak of their children, she could not get over the hurt. Their home had never been blessed with children. She and Rob had had bestowed upon them health, good friends, and many physical comforts in life; however, the one blessing that Clare had wanted most had never been granted.

At one time they had talked of adopting a child, but it had only been talk. The years had moved ahead, and Clare had plunged herself deep into her work. Then it was too late.

"How many children do the Blakes have, Rob?" Clare tried to sound unconcerned.

"Three or four," Rob responded.

"Is supper about ready?" It snowed on and off the next day, and Clare busied herself about the house. Rob had mentioned calling on the Blakes that day, but Clare found an excuse. Rob didn't question it. The snow was piling up outside, one of those freak March storms as winter makes its last stand. The day went by as so many others had for Clare. That evening Rob suggested that she make a batch of cookies, and they would take them over to Midge Blake the next day. This time Clare did not make an excuse. It would give her something to do tomorrow, she thought.

"Tit's a beautiful morning, Clare. Good to see the sun again." Rob had just come in from the barn. "Plenty nippy outside, though," he added.

Clare paused, "I haven't even been outside yet. It's too cozy in here to go out unless you really have to."

Rob put his arm about his wife. "I see that you took my suggestion, baking cookies for our new neighbors." 

"Yes, I was just starting. We 348 can take them over after lunch if you'd like, dear." A loud knock at the back door interrupted Clare. Hurriedly, she opened the door.

Standing there with flushed cheeks and disheveled, dark hair was a young woman in her early thirties. Clare noted that she hadn't even buttoned her coat. She appeared to have been running.

"I'm Midge Carlson-Blake," she spoke out of breath. "My little boy slipped and fell on the back steps. I'm afraid that he has broken his arm. My husband has taken the car to work, and I can't get the old truck started. Would you please help me? I ran all the way over here."

"Of course." Rob had his coat and boots practically on. "T'll take you into town."

"Mrs. Hopkins, my baby is asleep. Could I impose upon you to stay with him while we go? Two of my children are in school. If they have to X-ray and set my boy's arm, I am afraid it will be too long for me to take the baby with me. Besides, my other children only go to school half a day today. I wouldn't want them to come home to an empty house."

Clare hesitated only a moment. "I'll be glad to." 

"The Blake house was slightly run-down, but it was neat and clean. It had been so long since anyone had lived in it that it couldn't help being a little shabby. Clare helped Midge wrap the small boy in a blanket. His face was tear-stained, but they had found him sitting bravely on the couch where Midge had left him.

"See, Mommy hurried real fast as she said she would, didn't she?" Midge gently brushed the tears from the boy's eyes. "They were supposed to connect the telephone today. I couldn't even call for help."

The moment had come that Clare had been dreading. Softly she tiptoed into the bedroom where the baby lay sleeping. Peering down into the crib to make certain the baby was all right, Clare found two big brown eyes peering right back at her.

"You're not supposed to be awake now." Clare spoke quietly, not wanting to alarm the baby who had so suddenly been confronted by a stranger. Slowly she picked up the child and found her way to the kitchen area, my little one."

Clare rocked him gently. The baby bore a definite resemblance to his mother. Thick, curly, brown hair made the fair skin seem fairer. It had been so long since Clare had held a baby in her arms that at first she hardly knew what to do, and then finally, seemingly by instinct, she relaxed and cuddled the baby hand in hand close to her, humming softly.

The baby yawned contentedly and went back to sleep. "I don't want to put you down, but I had better." Clare had no sooner put the baby in his crib and left the bedroom door slightly ajar than two bouncing children ran inside the house.

"We're home, Mom," the boy called and then stopped, startled to see Clare. "Where is our mother?" the girl asked, obviously upset.

"Don't be alarmed, children," Clare smiled. "I'm Mrs. Hopkins. We live in the house down the road. Davey had a little accident this morning, and we think that he may have broken his arm. Mr. Hopkins took your mother and Davey to the doctor. I don't know how long they will be. I am going to stay with you and the baby until they get home."

"Poor Davey," the little girl remarked. "He is always falling down."

"Take your coats off, children, and we'll go into the kitchen and see if we can find something for your lunch." "T'm starved," the boy answered as he flung his coat into a chair.

"Chris, you know what Mother told you about your hanging up your coat," the little girl replied indignantly. Chris obliged. "Okay, okay."

Clare had never been so bombarded by questions and answers and stories in her entire life. She felt that she had been given the whole life history of the Blakes, right down to their dog Trixie and their cat Spot.

"Chris," Carol called out, annoyed. "You still haven't hung your coat up."

Clare smiled to herself. "Never mind, Carol. Just for today I will hang it up. This must be the closet." The door stuck slightly as Clare pulled it open. On each side of the closet were places to hang coats. However, in the center there were shelves with many books on them, obviously old Church volumes.

"My goodness, you have a lot of books in here," Chris answered. She picked up one of the large volumes and began to leaf through the pages, reading an occasional paragraph, scanning the columns.

Carol and Chris had gone into the kitchen and she could hear them talking. It was past time for their lunch. Hurriedly, she turned another page and glanced at the quotation from an address by Brigham Young: "Let me say here a word to console the feelings and hearts of all who belong to this Church. Many of the sisters grieve because they are not blessed with offspring."

The words must have been written for her. Surely she had grieved. She had been denied the blessing of children. The dear, sweet voices coming to her from the other room—those voices belonged to another woman's children.

Clare picked up a slip of paper to mark her place in the book. In the kitchen Carol and Chris were seated at the table, looking at their empty plates which Clare had put on the table. She went to the stove and stirred the steaming tomato soup and poured it into the bowls. She cut the sandwiches into triangles and filled the glasses with milk. Small hands reached for the food.

Clare touched Carol's braided hair. She smoothed the ribbon bow. Chris was breaking up his sandwich and soaking it in his soup. Clare watched his chubby fingers moving back and forth.

Again she realized her loss—how much of the beauty and blessings she had been denied. She turned back to the bedroom and picked up the book again, reading slowly, almost measuring the words.

"You will see the time when you will have children around you. If you are faithful to your covenants, you will be mothers of nations." Clare looked at the baby in the crib. He was awakening from his nap, his eyes opened wide, and he waved his hands. What a privilege it was to be with these children.

Again she turned to the book, to the words that spoke directly to her.

"Be faithful, and if you are not blessed with children in this time, you will be hereafter."

It was three o'clock before Rob and Midge returned. Rob carried the pale child into the house and laid him carefully upon the couch.

"It was broken, all right, Clare, but he was a real trooper." The doctor commented on how brave he was."

Rob patted the boy's head tenderly. For the first time in all the long years, Clare realized how Rob must have wanted a son of his own. She had thought that she was alone in her heartache. Now she knew that Rob, too, must have shared her sorrow, although he didn't show it.

How God works in mysterious ways. She had prayed so long to be relieved of her discontentment and bitterness, and in only a few hours it had melted away. Quite by accident she had found the books, and read the passage, and from that moment on she had felt herself being restored at last.

"Mrs. Hopkins, I can't thank you and your husband enough for what you have done. I couldn't have managed without you. It would have been impossible."

Midge hugged Clare, and Clare noted the strain on her face.

"I was happy to do it. Your children are just delightful, and that baby...."

Clare started to put on her coat.

"I was just making some cookies to bring over to you, but I'm afraid they didn't make it to the oven. I'll bring some over tomorrow. Oh, when Davey gets better, we'll have to start going to Relief Society together."

"Id like that very much," Midge said sincerely.

"I thought that I was going to be lonesome here, but I can see that I'm not. Thanks again for everything."

Hand in Hand

Rob drove cautiously on the road home.

"They're a nice family, aren't they, Clare?"

"Oh, Rob, they are. It is going to be so pleasant having them close to us." Clare was truly happy.

"You should see their baby. He is such a darling. I love them already."

"I know just how you feel. I've taken to them, too." Rob was even more intent on his driving.

"Rob, I never realized how you must have wanted children, too. I have been so selfish, thinking the burden was all mine, when all along it has been yours, too."

Clare touched his arm.

"Please forgive me."

Rob stopped the car in front of their house.

"I've never thought of it as a burden, Clare. Certainly I wanted children, but you're my wife. My dearest, I have always been so thankful that I have you. I thank God every day for you and the wonderful life that we have had together. God has not forsaken us. I'm sure that we shall have children in the eternities if we live worthily."

Clare couldn't hold back the tears any longer.

"Oh, Rob, I have been so blessed."

Together, they walked toward the house, hand in hand, and the world seemed brighter that day.

STORY TIME

Night hangs her lantern on the evening bars,
Opens the book of heaven, and.
The stars
Come twinkling in across the galaxy To
Learn the lesson of eternity:
How each, in his own orbit swinging clear,
And then impel a beam into the dark
To find some far place on the shadowed arc�
So one, still waiting, might look up and say,
"Oh, Star! Send me your everlasting ray!"

TESTIMONY

Jeanine Clark

"I am thankful for my trials that keep me humble."

The voice of the gentle Relief Society sister broke as she stood bearing her testimony that Tuesday morning. The words were almost startling to those who knew her best, for she had good reason to weep. Of her large family of children, fewer than half had chosen to follow the teachings and counsel of good and loving parents. Even as she spoke this morning, although we did not know it then, a new wound had been added to her sorrowing heart. Another child had made a wrong decision and committed a grievous error; yet, in tremulous tones, she praised the Lord and thanked him for hardships and trials that kept her humble!

Few of us heard the rest of her testimony. As she stood there in a cheap cotton dress, plain and unpretentious, in deepest humility, a love stronger than earthly sorrow seemed stamped on her countenance and it was almost as though the Master himself was standing there. In that moment, we saw true greatness—the greatness of a Christ-like soul. And in that moment came a glimmer of understanding of what it must have cost the Father to permit his children their free agency and then see one-third of them make the wrong choice.

It wasn't easy for him, either. And we realized that sorrow is not confined to man alone. Our Father trod a path of sorrow far greater than we can yet comprehend. And he still sorrows as he sees great numbers of the remaining two-thirds of his children falling away.

Close on the heels of that thought came another: How, then, can we mere mortals hope to escape trials and suffering? If the Creator of all, the All-Powerful, must drink of the bitter cup, so too must we pass through the refiner's fire. Thus, the human soul draws closer to God. The virtues of love, understanding, courage, and patience are nourished. Humility is born. Character is shaped, and a stronger, better soul travels down the pathway of life, learning to accept each new trial with courage, with meekness, with long-suffering, with "love unfeigned."

Yes, we silently admitted, sorrow and trials do have a very real purpose and place in life, and we do owe thanks to our Heavenly Father for the trials that keep us humble.

THE HEARTS OF THE CHILDREN | Loved to watch grandmother write in the old Gothic style; She learned it as a child, she said, on a small Danish isle. Now I must read and write the script of my ancestral land, And as I form each letter quaint, see grandmother's hand.

ONSTERNATION IN THE AIRGER 5 (2 aa (ae cP. S

There was consternation in the stake house kitchen the day the salad "didn't set up." Ready were dainty rolls, split and spread with thyme, rosemary, and oregano; punch made of sweet apple cider and ginger ale, on which floated a coronet of giant fresh frozen strawberries; divinity, soft as a cloud; and butter-smooth pecan panocha. But what good was all of this beautiful food, when ninety sisters would be ready for luncheon in less than two hours, and the salad would have to be served in bowls and eaten with spoons.

"The salad didn't set up." The whispered information had all the overtones of a national calamity. This luncheon was important. The Relief Society stake board was honoring the ward officers and teachers following the last leadership meeting of the season. The salad looked perfect, a delicate shrimp color and loaded, everyone knew, with such delicacies as tiny whole shrimps, sour cream, chopped chives, and other true party fare. But everyone who shook one of the twelve pans, or tried with a knife to check the consistency, sorrowfully agreed, "It hasn't set up."

The panicked sisterhood— all dazzling cooks but one—were not used to failure.

"T guess it would be too late to add some concentrated gelatin," someone suggested. "Far too late," Jasmine agreed. "Why don't we take it up to Clarice's and put it in the freezer?" was the next suggestion. Blocks of ice didn't sound appetizing.

"We'll have to run out and get some lettuce and tuna-fish and make a quick salad," Sally decided. With a certain amount of timidity and humility, the non-cook spoke up.

The non-cook was accustomed to failure. When her gelatin dessert didn't jell she used it as punch base and served it with cookies. When her custard, blancmange, tapioca, or sago refused to thicken she served it as sauce over drained canned peach halves. When her cake was too moist, she cut it in squares, sprinkled it with powdered sugar, and called the result brownies, or when it was too dry, she steamed it and served it with lemon sauce for pudding. When she cut into her meat loaf and found it still raw, she sliced it, slathered each slice with barbecue sauce, and finished cooking it under the broiler. When her divinity refused to become candy, she used it for icing on graham cracker sandwiches and had a treat for her grandchildren for weeks to come.

The unset salad wasn't an emergency; not even a full-sized challenge. "Buy head lettuce, red lettuce, water cress, and any other good looking greens you see in the closest market. Chop them, toss them, and serve this salad as topping," she suggested. "We'll all go to opening exercises and act as if nothing has happened," Jasmine said. And so they did.

But during the class period, one of the sisters hurried away to get the greens. "Don't ever tell a living soul what happened to the salad," Sally made everyone promise. But, of course, such a good secret couldn't be kept. "This is the best salad I ever tasted," the sisters kept saying. "Such wonderful dressing! May we have the recipe?"

Success is wonderful—it is much to be desired. But maybe we need a few salads that don't set up in order to teach us how to turn defeat into victory. Maybe our ingenuity would die if we never met with an unexpected situation. Many important scientific discoveries have been made because, through one small mistake, the method or the components were a little different and a new product was the result.

"Nothing succeeds like success," is an old proverb. The negative statement of the same truth might be, "Nothing fails like failure." But this isn't true. Nothing stretches our ingenuity, our abilities, like an unexpected "unset salad," and no success is as sweet as that which was born in near failure.

Ways to Use Leftover Pie Dough Dorothy Todd = Pie dough is for making pies. But whether you use an old family recipe or commercially produced piecrust mix, you can use the leftover pie dough in a variety of ways.

Uses for Scraps Intriguing novelties made from pieces of dough left over from trimming the crusts for a pie are useful and delicious. Scrap dough may be rolled a second, or even a third time, if handled lightly.

1. Turnovers: These are little rectangles of dough filled with jam, preserves, applesauce, or mincemeat. Gather the scraps of pie dough into a ball, and roll about 1/4-inch thick. Cut into rectangles 2 or 3 inches wide and 4 or 5 inches long. Fold 1/4 of the length from one end of the rectangle, and in this fold cut 3 or 4 slits 1/2-inch long, for the escape of air. Lay the rectangle flat again, and in the center of the unslit half, place about one tablespoon of filling. With cold water, moisten the edges of this half and fold the other half over it. Seal by pressing edges together with fingertips or tines of a fork. Bake on a cookie sheet, pie tin, or other shallow baking pan at 425° until edges are brown and filling bubbling (8 to 10 minutes).

2. After School Treats: These dainty bites consist of two layers of dough with a hole in the top to contain jelly or preserves. Roll dough as for turnovers. Cut round pieces with a circular cutter, and remove a smaller circle from the center of half of them. Place the whole circle on a shallow baking pan and moisten edges with cold water. Firmly press one of the circles with the center cut out on each. Bake until edges are brown, 6 to 8 minutes, at 425°.

When cool, fill centers with one to two teaspoons of filling. Cut these in other fancy shapes if desired, but remember to cut the hole for the filling in half of them.

3. Decorated Pastries: These little pastries have a melt-in-your-mouth quality. The use of colored frosting and a variety of shapes make them very festive. Pink valentines, green shamrocks, and orange Halloween pumpkins are produced with ease. Roll dough as above. With plain or fancy cutters, cut cookies and place on cookie sheet or other shallow pan. Bake in 425°F oven until edges are brown. Watch them carefully; less than five minutes may bake them enough. Remove at once from baking sheet and, when the cookies cool, spread with a thin coat either of butter frosting or a powdered sugar icing.

358 Ways to Use Leftover Pie Dough

4. Decoration for a One-crust Pie: Gaiety is added to a one-crust pie by using scrap dough for decorating it. Pumpkin pie looks charming with a jack-o-lantern face. Glazed cherry pie or other one-crust fruit pies can be decorated with a flower or a pinwheel. Little piecrust hatchets may decorate the top of cherry pie. Plan your decoration before cutting. Use cardboard patterns or miniature cookie cutters.

A flower consists of a small round center surrounded by any desired number of daisy petals. Blades of a pinwheel are crescent shaped, and about five in number, with a small round circle as a center. Gently press decorative cutouts onto the pie and bake.

Uses for Larger Quantities of Dough

When making a one or two-crust pie, make enough dough for an extra crust. Use it as suggested below.

1. An Extra Shell: Roll the leftover dough and fit it on the outside of a disposable aluminum pie tin or a regular pie plate. Flute edge. Prick sides and top with a fork. Bake 10 to 12 minutes at 425°F, and fill within the next day or two, or cover with foil and keep in refrigerator for several days and then bake.

2. Individual Pies: Use small tins, made from aluminum foil, for individual pies. Make individual pies of one or two-crust variety. Any sort of filling appropriate for large pies is good, but they are especially tasty with lemon chiffon, glazed cherry, or applesauce fillings for dessert. The only difference in preparing individual pies is that the baking time is less than for a large pie and must be adjusted accordingly.

3. Filled Tarts: Filled tarts are made by fitting tiny pie shells on the outside of muffin tins. Use cherry or berry pie filling, or any sort of cream or chiffon filling. To shape tart, cut a cardboard circle about 1-1/4 inches larger in diameter than the cup of your muffin tin. Ease and fold this circle onto the outside of the cup of your muffin tin. Prick sides and bottom with a fork and bake 8 to 10 minutes at 425°F. Cool shells before filling.

4. Pigs-in-the-blanket: These little delicacies make an ideal main dish for a luncheon, or in a miniature form, a delicious snack. Either version of pigs-in-a-blanket can be put to use in advance and stored on baking sheets in the refrigerator to be baked when needed. To make six "pigs," you will need six brown-and-serve sausages and about as much leftover pie dough as needed for a single 8-inch piecrust.

Roll dough and cut into rectangles about 1 inch longer than the sausages and about 3 inches wide. Place sausage on each rectangle; moisten edges with cool water, wrap sausage and seal all edges. Bake on a cookie sheet or other shallow baking pan 10 to 12 minutes in a 425°F oven. Serve with a creamy cheese sauce.

For luncheon, two of these, plus a vegetable or salad, and dessert, make a good menu. For miniatures, cut sausages in thirds, and use enough dough for each roll as above.

Start with these suggestions and add variety and enjoyment to your family meals. If you use your imagination, you can invent still other ways of using leftover pie dough.

Your Clothesline Shirley Thulin

Here is a new idea for a clothespin bag. It has several advantages over the other types we have been using. First, it has four openings for easy access to the pins. Second, the openings are easy to get your hand into, and yet they are slits which don't hang open. Dust and weather cannot readily get inside.

The new bag is very easy to make, and being something different, should sell at a bazaar or will please the new bride at a shower. You'll need two circles of sturdy fabric, nineteen inches in diameter. Denim would be a good choice. You also need enough contrasting bias tape to go around the outside edge and to bind the four eight-inch slits.

You may want a piece of wire to make a hook, or you may use bias strings to hang the bag to the clothesline.

TO MAKE: Cut four 8-inch slits in one of the circles (figure 1). Bind each slit with bias tape. Now reinforce the center of the circle by stitching a small circle of the denim to the wrong side. Attach two bias strings (about 10 inches long) to the center of the circle.

If you plan to use a wire hook, attach it after the bag is completed (figure 2). Place the two circles together, wrong sides inside. Bind all around the outside edge with bias tape and your bag is finished (figure 3).

Peanut Butter Janice T. Dixon

A I have perfectly beautiful children. Everyone says so—my mother, my Mother-in-law, my grandmother, my sisters—even total strangers. A total stranger came to my door a couple of weeks ago. "What perfectly beautiful children you have," he said. I agreed. "They deserve to be pictured for posterity," he said. I agreed. "If I could only take their pictures—free, of course." "Free!" "Of course."

Now, I am not like most mothers.

I see my children clearly for what they are—perfectly beautiful children. My husband says I am prejudiced, but if a professional photographer offers to photograph my perfectly beautiful children free, who am I to stop him? "Tomorrow," he said. After he left, I took a look at my three older boys, Charles, nine; Steven, seven; and Daniel, five, and decided that their hair was between Daniel Boone and the Beatles and rushed them, protesting all the way, to the barber shop.

"Like my hair long," said Charles. "All the boys wear it over their eyes." "A boy's haircut," I instructed the barber. "I'll catch cold if you cut it," Charles insisted. "Want a butch," said Steven. "A boy's haircut," I insisted. "Oh, brother!" Charles muttered, "Ill look like a cricket!"

"Ronnie has a butch, Mike has a butch. Everybody in Mrs. Vaterlaus' first grade has a butch," Steven protested. "Next time. This time you have a boy's haircut!" On the way home, Daniel said, "Tomorrow I'm going to be rich!"

"That's nice. Why?" "Cause I just lost a tooth. The tooth fairy is going to bring me lots of money!" I looked at him, horrified. A gaping hole smiled back.

"Oh, no! Toothless for the photograph!" I washed three-year-old Lucy's golden curls and was brushing them until they glistened when I heard loud fighting noises outside. I ran to the door just as the neighbor boy gave Charles a black left eye.

"He called me a cricket!" Charles muttered. "Nobody wears their hair this short unless they're a cricket!"

"Everybody in Mrs. Vaterlaus' first grade wears it butch, except me," Steven chimed in. I put cold cloths on Charles' eye and hoped it wouldn't swell. It did. The next morning it was dark and puffy and swollen. I considered his wearing dark glasses or a pirate patch over his eye for the picture.

"What is all of this hair doing on the floor?" my husband called. It was the remains of Steven's "boy's haircut." "All the kids in Mrs. Vaterlaus' first grade have butch haircuts," he explained. "Ronnie has a butch, Mike has a butch. Just everybody."

Hacked, uneven wisps stood on end in an inverted Mohawk. I gasped, grabbed a hat for him, and dashed for the barber. "You want me to shave his head, lady?" the barber asked.

My precious child, bald at seven! "No," I answered, calmly, "Just trim it." "Trim, she says!" the barber muttered as he tried to even up an impossible job. He gave Steven a "close cut."

I considered adding a wig or painting his head with brown shoe polish. "Just like Ronnie and Mike," Steven said, satisfied with his efforts.

I arrived home just in time to wave my husband off to work. "By the way, Lucy got into the Vaseline," he said as he backed out the driveway. She had indeed. Thick Vaseline jelly coated her golden curls until they stuck straight down in greasy globs.

I started washing. Every fifteen minutes I washed her hair, but it was still coated. Finally, I gave her a marcel and it stuck fine. "Hurry and get into your Sunday clothes," I instructed the children, then turned my attention to the baby. "Such a doll!" I crooned to him, pulling his thumb out of his mouth.

I changed him and put him in his new knit crawlers. He stuck his thumb back in his mouth. "I can't find my shoe," whined Danny. "My white shirt is in the ironing," cried Charles. "My tie is dirty!" said Steven. Lucy just smiled, peanut butter all over her face.

One-year-old Doug crawled into the room with peanut butter all over his clothes. "Doug's hungry," Lucy said. I found Danny's shoe in the dirty clothes hamper; ironed Charles' shirt; sponged Steven's tie, washed Lucy's face, and changed Doug's clothes. Then I put cake make-up on Charles' eye to cover up the deep blue crescent.

"Now sit and don't move until the photographer comes," I ordered. The doorbell rang. What a relief! All five were still clean!

"Danny says I can have my picture taken instead of him," said five-year-old Joey from three houses down. "Not today, Joey." "But I washed my face and hands," he explained.

I turned back to untangle Charles, Steven, and Danny from a wrestling match, and to wipe the peanut butter from Lucy's face. Doug was sitting in a pool of milk calmly sucking his thumb. "Doug's thirsty," said Lucy.

I changed Doug's clothes just as the photographer came. "These all yours?" he asked in an insulting tone. "Of course! Except for Joey." He sat smiling by Danny. I sent him home with a popsicle. "Let's get it over with."

He arranged the children, then rearranged them, and rearranged the rearrangement. "You, there. Open both eyes." Charles winked back. "He has a black eye. Can you retouch?" "Well maybe. Cost a little extra. Take the baby's thumb out of his mouth. Too bad about the second boy's short hair," he said. "High fever?" "No. Low scissors."

I pulled the baby's thumb out of his mouth. "Could you possibly retouch his hair?" "Possible. Cost extra." He turned on his bright lights. "Smile," he ordered. The children all looked glum. "Say cheese." They remained sober. "Say ice cream." Silence. "Say peanut butter." They grinned, except Lucy who headed for the peanut butter.

"Do you usually fix your little girl's hair that way?" he asked as I washed the peanut butter off Lucy's face and pulled Doug's thumb out of his mouth. "Make them smile," the photographer said. I danced around the room and made faces at the children. They burst into hilarious laughter, except Doug who burst into tears and stuck his thumb in his mouth.

I pulled out the thumb and suggested to Danny not to smile too big—no teeth, you know. I resumed my monkey antics, and the photographer flashed his pictures. I'm sure the pictures will look lovely. After all, I have perfectly beautiful children. If you don't believe me, just ask my photographer. And it only cost $68.40.

I wonder how much it would have cost a

The Magic of Forgetting Sylvia Probst Young

---

When I stopped at her home one evening last week, my neighbor, a silver-haired, wiry, little woman of eighty-four, was making cinnamon rolls.

The sweet, spicy smell that filled the kitchen, and the look of contentment on the face of my friend, as she rolled and cut the soft dough, made me glad to be alive and to bask in the warmth of a personality made more beautiful with the years. Later, when we sat on the porch enjoying the rich, warm rolls, and watching the setting sun paint the sky in pink and gold, I asked her what magic had given her so much zest for living. She was thoughtful for a moment, and then she said: "I believe one of the most important formulas for happiness in life is the magic of forgetting. It's the harboring of little hurts that cankers the heart, and so, through the years, I have tried to forget more than I have remembered." I have thought about her words many times since, and I have come to realize how profoundly wise is her philosophy. How easy it is to remember the angry words or the ingratitude and thoughtlessness of those we love. How easy to review a false accusation, an unkind remark, a seemingly obvious slight, until what might have been a little thing grows bigger and bigger. Cultivating a grievance, two women, who had once been good friends, went long years without speaking to each other. It was not until one of them was taken in death that the other came to realize, to her sorrow, how much that could have been good and beautiful had been ugly and sordid because neither one had learned to apply the art of forgetting in her life. I can forgive, but I can never forget, we often hear people say.

The Magic of Forgetting

Unless one forgets the wrong he never truly forgives, for only in forgetting is forgiveness really given. How human to err. With this in mind, can we not be more tolerant of the faults of another, knowing that we are human, too? And no one who nurtures bitterness can expect to reap happiness, for the two do not grow together. Wise, indeed, is my venerable neighbor, turning from the ugly, she has found the beautiful. From her I can learn a great lesson, and try to apply it in my own life, and by so doing I shall be a more worthy handmaid of the Lord.

MUSIC FOR SUMMER

There is music in the golden summer days—
Nesting linnets with glad twittering ways,
Rhotorby Leste, segue
Drowsy song of honeybee in the copse,
Happy note of robin in the treetops;
Staccato music in hail against the pane,
When comes the sudden rush of boisterous rain,
Swish of breakers sweeping up the land,
Tossing opalescent shells on drenched sand;
Plaintive, distant call of mourning dove,
Faint honk of wild geese from far above;
Melody of west wind whispered to the pine,
Fragrant with wild rose and pale columbine.

New music more lovely, to be remembered after,
Comes the lilting magic of children's laughter.

If Spring Be Late

Chapter 2

Maureen Taggart, a librarian, decides to go to Britain for some months in order to do genealogical research, travel, and look over an estate in Scotland to which she is joint heir. Before leaving, she meets Steve Madsen, an attractive widower and business executive who has just been transferred to Utah from the West Coast. She admires him very much and wishes that her plans for going away at this time were not quite so final.

Maureen reached the airport shortly before noon and was at her hotel in downtown New York an hour later. She spent the afternoon touring some of the high spots of the city, the United Nations, and Rockefeller Center. From the top of the Empire State Building, she could see the long, sleek lines of the beautiful boat, with its gently slanted red smokestacks. She boarded the ship the next day at midmorning, deposited her luggage in her cabin, and went up on the top deck to watch the departure.

By the time the boat was ready to leave, the pier was lined with people bidding farewell to friends and relatives. One of the crew handed Maureen a roll of serpentine and she threw it out joyously. She waved goodbye with all her might to no one in particular, since there was no one there whom she knew, but to the crowd in general.

Before long the call came "All ashore who are going ashore," and, shortly after, the great liner edged away from the pier. Maureen stayed on deck long enough to bid farewell to the Statue of Liberty and see the skyline of the city disappear, and then went down to her cabin. Her fellow traveler was already there, putting away her luggage. She was a girl in her early twenties, fair-haired, very pretty, and smartly dressed.

"Hello," she said, "I'm Diane Curran. Have you any preference which side you take?"

"It doesn't matter at all," answered Maureen. "The view is very much the same from either, I gather."

"Yes. I took this one because the porter had set your flowers over there."

"My flowers!" gasped Maureen. She had noticed briefly the bouquet on the stand but had thought nothing of it. Now she unfastened the card and read, "Bon Voyage—Steve." Her pleasure was so evident that the girl remarked, half laughing, "Those must be from your true love."

"From a mere acquaintance, really," said Maureen. "It is just that I am so surprised. I didn't dream of getting flowers. But, of course, I am also pleased."

"I should think so." As soon as they had unpacked, they went up to the lounge, and within minutes, the call for lunch was sounded.

"I do hope that I won't be seasick," said Diane. "I want to enjoy every minute of this."

"Indeed, so do I," agreed Maureen. "It is my first trip abroad and could very well be the last."

After lunch, they went out on the deck to arrange for their chairs. It was still warm and October's bright blue weather had extended over the ocean.

"Are you taking a tour?" Maureen asked.

Diane smiled happily. "No. I'm going over to be married. I met Sydney at school in Michigan. He was an exchange student. He is doing advanced work now and plans to go to one of the dominions to teach. I hope we will go to Canada. It won't be so far from home."

"It sounds wonderful," said Maureen. "I hope it all turns out well for you."

"Oh, I'm sure it will. Sydney is a terrific man. We have so much in common." Her rapt expression could have been worn only by one very young and very much in love.

Maureen could not help feeling a slight pang of envy.

"Are you going over to teach?" asked Diane. "I mean, people don't usually go on tours at this season of the year."

"No," said Maureen. "I'm a librarian, really. But I'm going over primarily to do genealogical research on my family line."

I shall be making my home with a cousin who lives near London. Then there is also another reason. He and I are joint heirs: to some property in Scotland. I don't know much about it, and it may not turn out to be anything of value. But it's going to be rather fun to find out." "T should think so!" exclaimed Diane. "I hope for your sake that it turns out to be simply fabulous." "Do you plan to be married soon after you arrive?" "Yes. As a matter of fact, I now have only twenty dollars to my name." "Oh, my dear! Wasn't that taking quite a chance?" "Yes, I guess it was, in a way. I worked through the summer vacation, but after I bought the clothes I needed and paid for my fare, that was all there was left. My mother is a widow and can't afford to do more for me. Sydney will meet me at Southampton and take over from there. And, if I had waited for everything to be just right, I might have lost him. That would have been really terrible." Maureen could not resist smiling at her vehemence. "Yes, I suppose so. Anyway, I'm going to keep rather close track of you until Sydney does take over." "Thank you. I'm glad to have an anchor." The day before they were to land, Maureen said, "We have to go up to the lounge today and get our landing cards. I'm afraid they won't agree to turn you loose in Britain with only twenty dollars. I'd like to lend you one hundred until we get off the boat—or get our cards, at least." "Oh, thank you very much! I most certainly don't want to have to work my way back to the United States, nor do I want to be smuggled ashore." Early the next morning they sailed into the harbor of Le Havre, and the two girls had their first glimpse of foreign soil. They found it very exciting and tried to determine what the tall buildings were up on the hill, what was being unloaded on the wharf, and where the various other ships in the harbor had come from. They were supposed to leave again within a couple of hours, but the wind was too strong to allow the tugboats to move the great ocean liner out of the harbor, and it was nearly noon before they finally steamed off for the British coast. "Poor Sydney," sighed Diane. "He'll have hours of waiting there at Southampton, and it's another couple of hours on the train before we get to London. I do hope it isn't raining. See, this is where I am to look for him." She brought out a letter which showed a diagram of the pier at Southampton and a very elemental drawing of people awaiting the arrival of the boat. A cross above one of them showed exactly where Sydney would be standing, so that Diane could wave to him while she was waiting to disembark. "That is very ingenious," agreed Maureen. "No one will be meeting me. My cousin is headmaster in a school and can't get away before Saturday. I have reservations at the Strand Palace in London for tonight. If Sydney has no other plans for you, I'll be happy to have you go with me." "Thank you very much. I'll be ever so grateful, unless he has made other arrangements." It was dark by the time they reached Southampton. Then there was a long wait while the luggage was being put ashore. Diane went up on deck to try to locate Sydney among the people waiting at the pier. After a while Maureen joined her. "Do you see him?" she asked. "I think so, but I can't be sure. It's so dark and they are so far away. But I know he is there." "Yes, of course," Maureen responded cheerfully. The hour dragged on and, at last, they were given the word that they might leave the boat. Diane was first in line and was met at the end of the gangplank by Sydney, who was first in line on that side. There was a joyful reunion while Maureen waited with just a touch of envy. Young love... She thought. How beautiful! How beautiful is love at any age, for that matter. Their first greetings over, Diane introduced Maureen with the words, "She has been wonderful to me. Quite the most marvelous friend I have ever found." "Then I shall love you, too," said Sydney, with a warm handclasp and a winning smile. "We'll have to go through customs," he added. "But that shouldn't take too long. Unless you have brought loads of course." "As, of course, we have not," Diane quickly replied. They went into the long building and located their luggage. As soon as they had checked through, they made their way to the train that would take them to London. They took the seat facing forward and were soon joined by more of the passengers. There was another half hour wait before the train finally started, and they were on their way. "I'll take you to a hotel," said Sydney. "We've already arranged for that," said Diane. "Maureen has reservations at the Strand Palace and has invited me to come with her for tonight." "Fine! That's near enough to the center of things for you to enjoy your first glimpse of London. And I'm told the food is excellent." It was near midnight when they finally arrived at the hotel. Sydney bade them goodbye briefly, saying, "I'll be around early tomorrow." They went to their room, put a shilling in the heater for a bit of warmth and, after prayers, climbed quickly into bed. "It's been quite a day, hasn't it?" remarked Maureen with a sleepy yawn. "Yes, quite a day," agreed Diane dreamily. "It really has been quite a day." "Well, goodnight, honey. We'll look forward to another wonderful day tomorrow." "Yes—and thanks for everything, Maureen." They soon drifted off to sleep and awakened the next morning to a bright October day. Breakfast in the dining room was a real treat, with some wonderfully light, flaky rolls. They had just gone into the lobby again when Sydney appeared, as bright and smiling as the October day. Sydney took Diane off to meet his parents and Maureen walked as far as Piccadilly Circus and back again before lunch. She was enchanted with the sights and sounds of the London streets—the high, red, double-decker buses, the window boxes filled with flowers, the "bobbies" with their chin-strapped helmets, and the business men with tightly furled umbrellas. For the first time, she was completely happy that she had come. Her cousin, Bruce Taggart, was to call for her at two. He came with his wife, Catherine, and two teen-age daughters, Julia and Kitty. Letters and photographs had been exchanged for years, but this was the first actual meeting and it was a most happy occasion. They visited in the lobby for awhile, getting acquainted.

Then Bruce said, "The girls want to do a bit of shopping while we're in town. Would you like to go with them, or visit here with me?" "I think that I had best stay here," she replied. "I have a young friend with me who has just come to meet her prospective in-laws for the first time. I would like to be here when she returns, just to make sure that everything is all right. We shared a stateroom on the boat and she stayed here with me last night." "It could be a rather delicate situation," said Bruce. "If you want to bring her along home with us there is ample room. We have a very large house. Not a very good house, I'm afraid, but large." "You are most kind. I may do that for the present. The girl is here practically without funds. Here they come now."

Diane and Sydney were introduced to Bruce. One glance at Diane's face told Maureen that all was not well. She hoped that it meant this was the course of true love, which was not supposed to run smoothly. She would have been more reassured, however, by a bright smile. To make her feel at ease, Maureen said quickly, "Mr. Taggart has invited you to go home with us to Bahlen until you make further plans." "Thank you very much," said Diane, obviously relieved. Mr. Taggart gave Sydney their address and telephone number, and he left, promising to call Diane the next day.

Now that Diane had returned, Bruce excused himself to go on a short errand. While they were waiting for Catherine and the girls to return from shopping, they went up to their room to pack. As soon as they were alone, Maureen asked, "Well how did it go?" Diane looked miserable and a trifle frightened. "Not very well. His parents don't want us to get married. Not now, I mean. They're supporting Sydney in school, and they don't relish the idea of taking on a wife in addition. I honestly can't say that I blame them." "Nor can I—in a way," agreed Maureen. "Unless they are people of means." She refrained from saying that all of this should have been cleared before Diane crossed the ocean. It was too late for that now, as Diane had, no doubt, been able to figure out for herself. "Do you have any plans at all—or haven't you had time yet to think it over?" "Well, for the present, there is only one thing I can do," answered Diane, "and that is to get a job. Sydney has suggested that he quit school and go to work. He could start teaching now and still work toward the higher degree, but I wouldn't think of it. Besides, his parents would never forgive me. I've had some secretarial training and some experience. There must be something I can do." "Yes, of course. We'll talk it over with Bruce as soon as it is convenient. In the meantime, you are not to worry at all. I'll keep track of you." "I know you will, and I can't tell you how grateful I am." "Don't try. I wouldn't feel natural if I didn't have some chick under my wing. And you seem to be the only one available at the moment." This brought a smile back to Diane's face, and she finished her packing in a more cheerful spirit.

They went down to the foyer and it was only a few minutes before Bruce returned, followed shortly afterward by Catherine and the girls. They all greeted Diane warmly and seemed genuinely thrilled that she was to be their guest. "Of course, you'll practically freeze to death in our house," Kitty informed her blithely. "But if you stay long enough, your blood will get nice and thick, like ours, and you won't mind it a bit." "I shan't mind it, anyway," replied Diane. "We have real winters in Michigan. I've known it to get twenty degrees below zero. Can you top that?" Kitty sighed. "I'm afraid not. And I shan't waste any more sympathy on you. I shall merely lend you an extra sweater."

"Come on ladies," said her father. "We'll walk over to the tube. It's only a short distance." At Diane's puzzled look, Julia explained, "It's the subway to you, I believe." And Maureen added, "We'll have to start learning English as it is spoken in Britain." "Especially since I am to marry a Britisher," smiled Diane. "Yes, indeed. But aren't you thankful he isn't French or Italian?" said Kitty. "I'm sure that English will be much easier for you." If Spring Be Late "T'm sure too. I already have a pretty fair start since knowing Sydney."

They walked over to the station, caught a train, and were in Bahlen within minutes. "We can walk from here to our house," said Bruce. "Our church is over there on Nightingale Lane. You are a Latter-day Saint, I suppose?" "No, I am not. But if they are all as good as you Taggarts, and as kind, I shall join tomorrow." "Not quite so fast," laughed Julia. "But we'll give you every chance."

As they walked along, Julia fell into step alongside Diane. She was a pretty girl of seventeen, interested in life in general, and right now, in this American visitor, in particular. "Perhaps I should tell you about our family," Julia said. "Anyway, about Mrs. Murch." "Yes, do tell me about Mrs. Murch. The name sounds like someone out of Dickens." "Exactly. She came to us during the London Blitz, which I don't remember, naturally, since I wasn't even around. They were not hurt so badly out here as many people in the city, who were bombed out and came here to live while their homes were rebuilt. Well, Mrs. Murch came to us and never left." "Had she no family?" "There was a daughter, whom she thinks she can still find—or rather, who will find her. I wanted to prepare you, since every stranger who comes is at first taken for her daughter. She doesn't realize that the girl would now be in her forties. She still thinks of her as the same girl she lost during the Blitz." "How sad! What does she do?" "Besides waiting for Cynthia to come home, she does a great deal of the cooking, which she seems to enjoy. And she knits afghans. Some of them we can sell, which gives her a bit of an income—at least, enough to buy more yarn. Others we give away. The Relief Society has been able to dispose of many of them. It keeps her occupied and contented." "Well, I hope that I shan't be on your hands for twenty-five years and have to resort to knitting afghans." eS lia laughed. "Not much danger! What are your plans—outside of meeting your young man and getting married? I know that Maureen came to do research. Are you also interested in that?" "No. I know nothing about that. I came here hoping to get married right away, but that doesn't seem to be working out."

So Ill. Have to find a job. Do you, by any chance, know of something I might get? I have had some experience as a secretary." "Well, there's Mrs. Markham, who always needs a secretary because no one can get along with her. But I wouldn't recommend her except in a case of dire emergency." "Well," said Diane, ''this could easily be just that. What is her work?" "She does a syndicated column on etiquette. You know, 'When I go out to dinner does my escort order for me?' and that sort of 374 thing. It is carried in about thirty newspapers and she seems to have a big following." "We'll keep her in mind," said Diane. "I'm not likely to have much of a choice." They had arrived now at the Taggart home. It was indeed large, rambling, and apparently quite old. There were flowers about and a degree of charm, on the whole, that reminded Diane of an ancient, but thoroughly pleasant, "Grand Dame." As if reading her thoughts, Julia waved her hand airily and said, "Queen Victoria, as you see. But we love it. There is room for everyone to spread about. Father has a study, Mrs. Murch a sitting room that holds all her yarns and afghans. That's Father's school over yonder." "And you, are you still in school?" asked Diane. "No. Kitty is. I work in a solicitor's office—lawyer to you." "Yes, I know. Sydney's father is a solicitor. My fiancé, you know." "Oh, yes. I hope he is a good one. Mine is old and doddering and doesn't make much money. In consequence, neither do I." She seemed so unconcerned that Diane didn't waste any sympathy. They went into the house and were immediately greeted by Mrs. Murch, who rushed up to Diane, took her arms and searched her face. Julia pulled her gently away. "No, Mrs. Murch," she said, "This is not Cynthia. This is Diane Curran and she is to be our guest for a time." Mrs. Murch did not seem too greatly disappointed. Evidently this scene had been played many times before. Catherine took the two guests to their rooms and told them that dinner would be ready in an hour. Maureen walked to a window and looked out on a garden at the rear of the house. It was lush with late-blooming flowers. In one corner was a small greenhouse. For some strange, but satisfying reason, she felt very much at home. Kitty came to call them to dinner and they went down to a real English meal of roast beef and Yorkshire pudding. There were also some excellent tomatoes. "I suppose these came from the greenhouse," said Maureen. "Yes, and served especially in your honor," said Julia. "We prefer them fried for breakfast." "I'll take them that way too," smiled Maureen. "When in Rome." After dinner, they went into the living room, where a bright blaze in the grate drove out the chill of the October evening. "I imagine that you are eager to know about the inheritance," suggested Bruce. Well, curious, at any rate," Maureen replied. "Have you seen it yet?" "No. In fact I thought we would wait until the spring holiday so that Catherine and the girls could go with us. There is still rather a lot of legal work to be done." "And with my employer doing it, the work won't be done before spring," added Julia. "That's quite all right with me," said Maureen. "I hope to find enough records to keep me busy for several months. I can work on my mother's line—the Conklins—you know." If Spring Be Late Catherine broke a brief pause to observe, "I think that we had best not say anything about this inheritance in the neighborhood. Rumors can grow, and we need to know just what it amounts to before we give anyone cause for speculation." "You are quite right, my dear," said Bruce. "You girls will keep that in mind, of course." "Certainly," said Kitty. "I can manage to wait a few more months before people start calling me Lady Kitty. Or shall I be the Honorable Kitty Taggart?" "You'll be just plain Kitty Taggart, more than likely, as you always have been," replied Julia. "Kitty—but not plain," she declared with a toss of her auburn curls. Mrs. Murch left the room just then to go up and get more yarn for her knitting, and Catherine said, "I hope that she will remember not to say anything about this in the neighborhood." "Remember or not, it's probably too late. I daresay that she will have spread the news the entire length of the street by tomorrow night," said Julia. "Oh, dear, I hope not," said her father. "Try to impress upon her that we'll make no mention of this. It could be difficult for me at school. I should have thought of that before I spoke." "Granted," said Catherine. "I'll do my best and hope it's good enough!" "But, knowing our Mrs. Murch, I predict that it won't be," said Kitty, blithely and ominously. (To be continued) 375 376 Stakes and missions are to be congratulated on their success in 1967 in placing The Relief Society Magazine in 271,400 homes of the Church, an increase of 12,908 over 1966. The English Magazine subscriptions totaled 265,000—12,098 more than last year. Spanish subscriptions were 6,400, an increase of 810 over last year's total. These successes represent an all-time high. The General Board is always endeavoring to increase the value and beauty of the Magazine, and it is heartwarming to have the Magazine representatives, under the direction of the respective presidencies, do such an outstanding work, for work it is to contact sisters in a ward or branch, perhaps returning to the homes once or twice to speak with them. Only the knowledge of the great importance of the calling of a Magazine representative would call forth such devotion from Magazine representatives. There were twenty-seven more stakes on the Honor Roll in 1967 than in 1966. For the twenty-second year, South Los Angeles Stake leads the Church in the percentage of subscriptions, followed for the ninth year by Huntington Park Stake. Of the highest ten on the Honor Roll, seven are from California and one each from Utah, Idaho, and Arizona. All stakes in Australia and Canada are on the Honor Roll, many with high percentages. It is satisfying to know that the editorial staff receives an increasing number of submissions from countries other than the United States. The Relief Society Magazine is noteworthy as a medium through which the sisterhood in the world grows closer together in common understanding and love. The Spanish edition is a potent tool in strengthening the Spanish-speaking sisters, both those in the United States and in Mexico, Central, and South America. South Box Elder, Norwalk, and Chicago South Stakes are to be congratulated on their great percentage increases this past year, 38%, 30%, and 25% respectively. In the missions, the Southern Australian and the Alaskan-Canadian missions are to be congratulated on their percentages of increase.

The General Board extends its heartfelt thanks to everyone who has had a part in placing The Relief Society Magazine in the homes and also to those who subscribe so faithfully year after year and who write such appreciative letters to the General Board, many of which appear on the From Near and Far page.

INTRODUCTION The term rehabilitation means to put back in good condition or reestablish on a firm, sound basis. This is a very broad term encompassing many areas. The purpose of this lesson is to acquaint the homemaker with several basic rehabilitation procedures necessary to restore the sick patient in the home to a useful life. REHABILITATION PROCEDURES Much can be done in the home to help the sick person: a. Proper positioning in bed will prevent the formation of contractures (stiffness of muscles and joints). b. Good skin care will prevent the occurrence of bed sores. In caring for elderly patients or those who must remain bedfast for a long period, it is important to give proper attention to the skin to avoid bedsores. These sores develop most often on the base of the spine, elbows, hips, heels, and toes. They may occur in any area where two surfaces of the skin come together. These precautions can prevent them: 1. Keep sheets dry, clean, and smooth. 2. Keep patient's clothing dry. 3. Prevent skin chafing by rubbing it carefully with a skin lotion or cold cream at least twice each day. 4. Change position of patient frequently to prevent irritation on pressure points such as heels, elbows, buttocks, etc. 5. In using bed pan, slip it under buttocks gently. If the skin is moist shake talcum powder on the bed pan. A soft pad placed between the patient's back and the pan will avoid irritation of the skin. c. Range of motion exercises will help to discourage deformities and maintain or improve muscle strength. d. Interest and encouragement in the patient's attempts to help himself will help to prevent the onset of apathy and loss of motivation. e. The use of the proper type of bed for the patient speeds recovery and makes it easier to care for him. 393 May 1968

The basic bed equipment should include a firm mattress, a bedboard placed between the springs and mattress, and a footboard. F. A firm mattress and bedboard help support the segments of the body and prevent sagging of the patient's hips. Also, it makes it easier for a patient to move and turn in bed and to sit up or maintain balance. G. A footboard is used to support the feet at right angles to the legs when the patient is lying on his back. This position prevents development of a _ foot-drop deformity where the feet tend to drop | forward. It also helps to keep the bedcovers off the patient's feet and prevents pressure on the toes and bedsores on the heels.

THE PATIENT'S COMFORT, CHANGING POSITIONS

To keep the patient comfortable and help prevent bed sores, it is important to change the patient's position often. The illustration shown in Figure 1 demonstrates proper positioning for the patient lying on his back in bed.

Figure 1. Back Lying
Patient lying straight.
2 Pw Ne Flat pillow under head, neck, and shoulders.
Shoulders level.
Hips level.
Feet against footboard.
Toes pointed straight up.
Heels of the feet rest over the space between mattress and footboard.

Figure 2. Face Lying
1. Feet against footboard.
2. Toes hang over edge of mattress.
3. No pillow under head.
4. Flat pillow placed under patient's abdomen.

Figure 3. Side Lying
1. Hips and knees slightly bent.
2. Rolled pillow supporting back.
3. Leg on upper side brought forward slightly on pillow.
4. Upper arm supported on pillow.
5. Prevent dropping of the shoulder.

When a patient is lying on his back with his legs relaxed, the legs have a tendency to roll out to the side. A trochanter roll should be placed on the outer side of a patient's leg to prevent this rotation.

Figure 4. Demonstrates the proper placement of a trochanter roll.
Figure 4. Trochanter Roll
1. Roll is placed at the hip on the involved side.
2. The edge of the roll is placed under the hip.
3. It is under-rolled firmly against the thigh and tucked slightly under the hip to hold the leg in good alignment.

When positioning a paralyzed patient, it is important to place a roll in his hand. The hand roll is used to maintain functional position of the hand.

Figure 5. Demonstrates the proper positioning of a hand roll.
Figure 5. Hand Roll
1. Position the thumb in opposition to the fingers.
2. The wrist should be extended.
3. Hand roll is placed diagonally across palm of hand.
