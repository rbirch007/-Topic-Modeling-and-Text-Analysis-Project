Joseph Fielding Smith of the First Presidency Address delivered at the Officers Meeting of Relief Society Annual General Conference, September 27, 1967] » My dear sisters, brethren, too, as we have a few of them among us. It is a pleasure to stand before you this morning, and I ask that the Lord will bless me that I may give to you the things that you desire. I would like to speak on obedience. I would like all the Latter-day Saints to feel in their hearts that the work in which they are engaged is not only the work that God has instituted in these latter days, but that it is a work in which each individual member is deeply and vitally interested. Every man and woman should feel a deep and abiding interest in the work of the Lord. It is only the possession and observance of the truth that can make us free, and all those who do not possess and obey the gospel are slaves and are not free. God has established all things in their order. The house of God is a house of order, not a house of confusion. We must walk in his paths, and observe his precepts to do them, or we will be cut off. It is only by observance to the laws of God that men and women can rise above the petty weaknesses of mortality and exercise that breadth of affection, that charity and love, that should actuate the hearts and the motives of men. It requires no special bravery on the part of men and women to swim with the currents of the world. When men or women make up their minds to forsake the world and its follies and identify themselves with the Lord's people, it takes courage, character, and superior intelligence. The man or woman in this Church who desires to enrich his or her faith in the highest possible degree will desire to observe every rite and ordinance in the Church in conformity to the law of obedience to the will of God. In these things, and through them, we gain a more perfect knowledge of our Maker, and enriched faith means an enlarged power, and though we may not have in this life an occasion to exercise all the powers that come to us through the enrichment of our faith, those powers may be enriched in their fulness in eternity, if not in time. The man and woman, therefore, among the Latter-day Saints, who does not see the necessity for the ordinances in the House of God, who does not respond to the requirements of the gospel in all its rites and ordinances, can have no proper conception of the great work which the Latter-day Saints have been called upon to perform in this age, nor can we enjoy the blessings that come from the virtue of obedience to a law higher than that of man. The gospel is very simple when we understand it properly. It teaches us to forgive, to overcome selfishness, anger, wrath, faultfinding, complaining, and the spirit of contention and strife. It also teaches us to do here just what we would be required to do in the heavens, with God and his angels. If we would listen to its teachings and obey them, and put them into practice, there would be no desire to covet in the hearts of the children of men. They would possess the Spirit of Jesus Christ and understand the precepts of the gospel as he taught and admonished all men to observe them. I would like to quote you the following: Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. (James 1:17.) To please him, that is the Lord, we must not only worship him with thanksgiving and praise, but render willing obedience to his commandments. By so doing, he is bound to bestow his blessings; for it is upon this principle (obedience to law) that all things are predicated. So you see, sisters, just what obedience can do for us if we will follow the teachings of the Lord. Now I want to say to Relief Society, and to all the rest of the organizations in the Church, for that matter, that not one of them is independent of the Priesthood of the Son of God; no one of them can exist a moment in the acceptance of the Lord, when they withdraw from the voice, from the counsel of those who hold the Priesthood and preside over them. They are subject to the powers and authority of the Church, and they are not independent of them; nor can they exercise any rights in their organizations independently of the Priesthood and of the Church. Furthermore, the officers of these organizations are duly presented at the general or local conferences, as the case may be, and are sustained by the vote of the people of the Church, and, as such, the officers should be respected in their callings and given recognition and support in the performance of their duties in all that relates to the organizations which they represent. I would like to say to Relief Society, that it is the one great organization in the Church, whose duty it is to look after the interests of the women in Zion. And I shall repeat, it was organized by the Prophet Joseph Smith, and I expect to see the day when this organization will become one of the most perfect, most efficient and perfected organizations for good in the Church, but that day will be when we shall have women not only imbued with the spirit and testimony of Jesus Christ in their hearts, but also with youth, vigor, and intelligence to enable them to discharge the great duties and responsibilities that rest upon them. We realize that it is impossible for women possessing physical weaknesses on account of age or infirmities to meet every requirement; but we expect every woman entrusted with responsibility in the Church to do her duty to the utmost of her ability. That we look for; that we pray for; and for that we labor to the best of our ability and strength we possess, and we trust that from this time forth, that you good sisters will go back to your wards and stakes with renewed energy, judgment and wisdom, and perform the duties that are assigned to you, even those who are called to take the oversight of the great work, the Relief Society organization. May we be obedient to the commandments that the Lord has given us. If we are, he will bless us and magnify us in our callings. President McKay has asked me to give to you sisters his love and to let you know how much he appreciates the work you are doing in this great organization, and he also expressed a desire to leave with you his blessing.

I would like to commend you on the wonderful work you are doing in this great cause, and pray the Lord will bless you with every blessing needed, and I leave my blessing with you, in the name of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. Amen.

Co oi ~- See ly rs Elder Harold B. Lee of the Council of the Twelve

[Address Delivered at the Officers Meeting of Relief Society Annual General Conference, September 27, 1967]

Thank you, President Smith, for that excellent message which we were able to hear. I am always delighted to be in the company of President Smith.

I have occasion frequently to read from the Doctrine and Covenants where the Lord told Hyrum Smith that his name would be held in honorable remembrance through all the generations of time because of his faithfulness and devotion and his loyalty to the work of God. When I think that Hyrum Smith's son was the President of the Church, and that his grandson is now President of the Twelve, I am seeing the beginning of the fulfillment of the Lord's promise to the posterity of Hyrum Smith.

President Smith, we honor you for what you are and whom you represent in the great council of the Priesthood today. Now, if the spirit is willing and I can follow along where, unfortunately, I haven't caught the theme of your whole meeting, 7 January 1968 excepting President Smith's remarks, but I commend them all to you with a full understanding because his message on obedience should ring true in the hearts of all of us.

The sisters have asked me to talk to the subject, "The Mother's Place in a Gospel-Centered Home Teaching." I announce that so that you will know what I was supposed to talk about if I miss the mark.

Dr. David Sarnoff, who is called the father of television and radio, is quoted as having said: The happiest people I have known have not been the men of great worldly achievements or accomplishments of wealth. They have been the simple people who are happily married, enjoying good health and good family life. (Wisdom Magazine 22nd issue.)

TEACH THE CHILDREN

In an epistle to the Church, addressed to the Church by President Brigham Young and his Counselors, John W. Young and Daniel H. Wells, just six weeks prior to his death, in 1877, he said some important things.

Among the many duties which devolve upon us, there is none that should receive more careful and constant attention than the education of our children. They are numerous, and if properly trained will become a great blessing to the inhabitants of the earth. Parents should take time—if not every day, at least as often as they can—and not allow many days to elapse—to call their families together and interrogate them respecting their associations, their words, actions, etc., and teach them the principles of the gospel. They should send them regularly to day and Sunday schools and furnish them every possible facility for gaining a sound and thorough education, and especially in the principles of the gospel and in the history of the church.

The teachers to whom we entrust our children for education should be faithful Latter-day Saints, sound in doctrine and thoroughly imbued with a love of Zion. In this way we can rear up a generation of men and women who shall love and maintain truth and righteousness in the earth.

President Joseph F. Smith, after quoting the Lord's requirement to teach the children, which you find in Section 68 of the Doctrine and Covenants, said: And if parents fail to do this and the children go astray and turn from the truth, then the Lord has said the sin shall be upon the heads of the parents. The loss of the children will be charged to the parents and they will be responsible for their apostasy and darkness.

I came to the conclusion, after reflection upon this subject... I do not believe that it would be possible for me to be admitted into exaltation and glory in the Kingdom of God if through my neglect of duty my children should become the children of darkness in this regard... My children must not and will not turn away with my consent. I will plead with my children; I will endeavor with all the power I possess to have them as true and faithful to this gospel as it is possible for me to be; because, without all of them in the Kingdom of God I would feel that my household was not perfect.

(Conference Report, April 1898.)

The Lord, in expressing his displeasure with Eli, you will remember the story when the boy Samuel heard the call three different times and was told by Eli this time to listen, he said, in criticizing Eli and in harmony with what President Smith has said:... Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle. For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth.... Now notice what he says the iniquity was,... Because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.

THE MOTHER'S ROLE

Now, the importance of the teaching of the gospel in the family was expressed in this revelation in the first Section of the Doctrine and Covenants and four important purposes of gospel restoration as they apply particularly to the home were expressed:

1. That faith also might increase in the earth;... And inasmuch as they erred that it might be made known;

2. And inasmuch as they sought wisdom they might be instructed;

3. And inasmuch as they sinned they might be chastened, that they might repent;

4. And inasmuch as they were humble they might be made strong, and blessed from on high, and receive knowledge from time to time.

Now, the mother's role in this vital home-centered gospel teaching is very clear, and I just speak in headlines now with four or five of what I conceive to be the mother's prime responsibilities. The first I would say to mothers, don't give up on the boy or girl in that insufferable state of super-egotism through which some teen-agers go. I plead with you for those boys and those girls.

Don't give up on the boy or girl in that impossible stage of independence and disregard of family discipline. Don't give up on him or her when they show a shocking display of irresponsibility. The know-it-all, self-sufficient want-nothing-of-counsel, which to him is just a preachment of an old-timer who has lost step with youth.

Knowing is not enough—we must apply. Willingness is not enough—we must do. Nothing is more terrible than ignorance in action. Fools and wise men are equally harmless. It is the half-fools and the half-wise who are dangerous.

(Goethe) A university professor is quoted as having said, "Isn't it wonderful that the Lord has made young people so handsome and good-looking; else how in this world could we put up with their nonsense?" A harassed mother was called by a friend who asked her, "What do you think of all these riots going on in all the cities in the country?" And this mother answered, "I'm so busy putting down all the little riots in my own home that I don't have time to worry about riots elsewhere." We have a missionary grandson in the North British Mission. He hadn't been there very long until he wrote back an interesting letter in which he said the advice of his parents now comes back to him with great force. It is like a book on a shelf that has been there for nineteen years and he has just begun to take it down and start to read it for the first time. That is your son and your daughter. You may think they are not listening. They may think they are not listening, but one time yours may be the book that they will take down and read again when they need it most.

OPPOSING FORCES

There are forces that come into play after parents have done all they can to teach their children. Such a force influenced the younger Alma who, with the sons of Mosiah, set out to destroy the work of their great fathers. The angel, you remember, was sent and he knocked him down and hit him right between the eyes, I suppose, and he lay as though he were dead for three days and nights. And the angel said,... "Behold, the Lord hath heard the prayers of his people, and also the prayers of his servant, Alma, who is thy father; for he has prayed with much faith concerning thee that thou mightest be brought to the knowledge of the truth; therefore, for this purpose have I come to convince thee of the power and authority of God, that the prayers of his servants might be answered according to their faith." (Mosiah 27:14.)

It was so with Nephi, whom his unruly brothers sought to destroy. And when the angel said, "Ye are swift to do iniquity but slow to remember the Lord your God. Ye have seen an angel, and he spake unto you; yea, ye have heard his voice from time to time; and he hath spoken unto you in a still small voice, but ye were past feeling, that ye could not feel his words; wherefore, he has spoken unto you like unto the voice of thunder, which did cause the earth to shake as if it were to divide asunder." (1 Nephi 17:45.)

And then Nephi, after he said that, continued: "In the name of the Almighty God, I command you that ye touch me not, for I am filled with the power of God, even unto the consuming of my flesh; and whoso shall lay his hands upon me shall wither even as a dried reed; and he shall be as naught before the power of God, for God shall smite him." (1 Nephi 17:48.)

I am remembering now a dramatic time when, at a funeral sermon an unruly son of a mother in whose honor we were meeting in that service, asked if he might speak at his mother's funeral service. And there, in great detail, with more boldness than I would have dared to have talked about him, because I knew his life, he told how, as a boy growing up, he had disregarded wholly the admonitions of his little German father and mother and how, finally, the father and mother gone, he was beginning to read, as it were, that Book which had been unread for all these years. And he bore witness to the influence the mother and father had had upon him even while he was transgressing about every law in the Book.

PUT FATHER AT THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE

The second role I would say in the responsibility of the mother is to put father at the head of the house. That is a statement from the famous judge who said he thought it was that which lay at the root of many of the problems in a delinquent home. How does mother do it? Someone said that little children soon outgrow their need for affection, but fathers never do. Now that is the first way to put father at the head of the house. Even when he doesn't deserve it. When he does deserve it, kiss him, and if he gets angry, ignore him. Give him the silent treatment. But never, never let him feel that you don't understand him.

Put father at the head of the house.

President Brigham Young said: "I know that you good women get annoyed and provoked and out of patience many times with your husbands, and at times justly so. They are not always as considerate of you as one would expect a husband to keep his confidence— which may be just an escape." I had a call from Meridian, Idaho, identity withheld. So, we are just wasting time to come to the General Authorities and leap-frog over the bishop and the Stake President. I had a letter from a sweet girl whose marriage I performed some years before, and it started out about the problems, and I thought, here is a temple marriage that has failed. Immediately we began to have problems. We tried then and have tried since to figure out just why. There was no particular thing that consistently precipitated our difficulties. We were active in the Church and attended our meetings; we prayed; we paid our tithing; we returned to the temple regularly. We loved each other so and had such expectations for our marriage. Then we were expecting a baby, and, in spite of our very great happiness in anticipating this child, things seemed to go so bad as to seem insolvable. Almost a year after we began, we knew we couldn't continue together any longer under such conditions, and I called the bishop, who was also our friend, and we went over. The three of us talked—a little. You know, I don't recall anything particular that was spoken except the questionable encouragement he offered by saying that he and his wife had had a difficult time after awhile when they were married. The inference was, we solved our problems, why can't you? But when we left the bishop's office we knew we had reached the turning point somehow. We had touched the bottom and we were on our way up. I can't explain why or what happened, but we did start up and we've been on our way up ever since because they followed the route of the bishop.

FAMILY HOME EVENINGS

I asked a mother in a family if they were having Family Home Evening, and she wrote back and said: "I mentioned a serious illness."

I hope this doesn't seem vain, but for the first time I realized how important I was to my children. As I lay helpless to care for any of their needs, and knowing that—except for my Heavenly Father's intervention—my influence upon them in this life was ended, how desirable and precious seemed the hours in the weeks and months and years ahead. I determined many things then concerning how to use that time, were it granted to me. One was to spend time nightly reading and talking to the children. I fall short, but we usually spend an hour five evenings a week together. Besides the other things they have been interested in, I have read most of The Book of Mormon to them from the children's volumes. It was my idea at first, but not for long. I have no doubt that it is meaningful to them when I hear my eight-year-old offer thanks in his prayers for the prophets who kept the records, or when my five-year-old son is thankful that Nephi got away safely into the wilderness with the faithful when Laman and Lemuel sought to kill him. Our experience has been that any time we have an opportunity to help our children expand in their love and understanding of the gospel and the Father who created them, our love for one another also increases, and our family solidarity is influenced in the most significant way. For this reason, the Family Home Evening is of paramount importance to us.

Now, you mothers, over the Church, we are preparing some of the finest lessons that have ever been prepared for families to be taught by fathers and mothers in every home. We have printed 650,000 manuals to be placed in every home in the Church. You are missing a great opportunity in every home where that Family Home Evening Manual is not being studied.

MOTHERS STAY AT CROSS ROADS OF THE HOME

Finally, the last that I shall mention, keep the mother of your home at the "cross roads" of the home. There is a great danger today of homes breaking down because of allurements to entice mothers to neglect their being at home as the family are coming or going from the home. Now I recognize the necessity of some mothers being required to earn sustenance for their family. I am recognizing that, but even here Relief Society presidents and bishops should take care lest they fail to lend all aid possible to permit the mother of small children to be with them, if possible, in planning the nature of work or the schedule of time. All this is within the province of the Relief Society working with the home.

HOME—A ROOF OVER A GOOD WOMAN

Well, just a few simple suggestions of the mother's role in the home. If we were to define the home as I know it to be so true, I would say, "a home is a roof over a good woman." God grant to the mothers of this Church the powerful influence to be Woman's Glorious Purpose wielded fully to say as the old patriots, oh, if you remember, "I am only one, but I am one. I can not do everything, but I can do something, and what I can do, by the grace of God I will do." And someone put it in these words, "Give what you have to give, you mothers. It may be better than even you dare to think that it is at the time."

That the Lord may help you so to do and rise to your great opportunity as the mothers of men; the creators of the atmosphere in the home that will go far to their strengthening when sons and daughters are all too soon taken away from your influence. May you build on that strong foundation and teach the mothers under your influence to do likewise, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

A THE HARVEST

Linnie Fisher Robinson

The years blow, burn, at the day's long turning
To excellence or ill, and void of sound;
The slow pulse measures in silent churning,
And the dark hair whitens a circle round.
But, oh, the wrecked hopes, the songs long stilled,
The flame's quintessence beyond human eyes.
The soul expands as it fashions and gleans
And the heart rejects all that dust implies.

In silent chambers, visitless, unseen,
Small cherished dreams are nourished more
Than the dawn of day or the spring's new green;
More than the strong loves beyond the door.
The heart holds all, even as it must,
And the harvest of age is the heart's long trust.

IN MEMORIAM

President Antoine R. Ivins of the First Council of Seventy
May 11, 1881—October 18, 1967

= President Antoine Ridgeway Ivins, senior President of the First Council of Seventy, passed away October 18, 1967 at the age of eighty-six. He succeeded President Levi Edgar Young as the senior president in 1963. President Ivins has been a member of the First Council of Seventy for thirty-six years. During that time he spent three years as head of the Mexican Mission and thirty years as a member of the Church missionary committee.

A native of St. George, Utah, he was the son of Anthony Woodward and Elizabeth Ashby Snow Ivins. His father was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve and a Counselor in the First Presidency to President Heber J. Grant. Most of President Ivins' early life was spent in Colonia Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico. He obtained his early education in Colonia Dublan, and was graduated from the Juarez Academy and studied law at the School of Jurisprudence in Mexico City. He also studied at the University of Michigan, then returned to Utah and was graduated from the University of Utah. He was a fluent 14 speaker and a thorough scholar of Spanish.

In 1920 he helped build the Lund Home for Boys at Centerville, Utah. He served six years as treasurer of the Great Salt Lake Boy Scout Council and organized several Scout troops. Before his appointment to the First Council of Seventy, President Ivins was manager of the Church-owned sugar plantation in Hawaii.

Throughout his life, he was dedicated to the gospel, and an active supporter of the youth. In 1957, he received the "All-Church" Honorary Master M-Man award for "outstanding service to the youth of the Church." He married Vilate Ellen Romney in the Salt Lake Temple, June 26, 1912. Sister Ivins passed away in 1964, two years after they celebrated their fiftieth wedding anniversary.

The General Board and members of Relief Society in all stakes and missions of the Church extend sympathy to President Ivins' family and his many friends. He has left a heritage resplendent in faith and good works, and an excellent example of devotion to the Church for all to follow.

President Belle S. Spafford

The General Presidency of Relief Society is pleased to announce the appointment by the First Presidency of Sister Evon Waspe Peterson as General Secretary-Treasurer of Relief Society on November 15, 1967.

Sister Peterson has served as a member of the General Board since June 1945, during which time she has made a significant contribution to the advancement of the work of Relief Society as a General Board member, and has endeared herself to the women of Relief Society through her thoughtful consideration of them and through her capable service in working with them. In April 1952, she was named Administrative Assistant to the General Presidency, a position which involves responsible managerial duties, which she has met with competency and in a spirit of dedicated service. Through training and experience in both Relief Society work and in the field of business, Sister Peterson is eminently qualified to hold the important office of General Secretary-Treasurer. Prior to her call to the General Board, she held responsible positions with the Red Cross, was secretary for the Community Chest drive for several years, and for ten years she was secretary to the Superintendent of the Granite School District. Since her childhood, she has consistently worked in the auxiliaries of the Church, serving the Relief Society in both ward and stake capacities, generally holding secretary-treasurer or presidency offices. Sister Peterson is by nature modest and unassuming. She is loyal to those who preside over her and is trustworthy in every assignment given her. She is a prodigious as well as a highly competent worker. She is the wife of John Vernon Peterson and the mother of two children—a daughter, Carolee Peterson Kempton, and a son, Ronald E. Peterson—all of whom devotedly support her in her Church callings. She is the grandmother of six children. Sister Peterson's parental home—the home of Brother and Sister William Waspe, converts to the Church from England—was a home where service to the Church was a way of life. In her new appointment, she has the love and confidence of the General Presidency and her associates on the General Board. Her future service will be a blessing to the sisters and to the Relief Society just as her past service has been. We all wish for her much happiness in her new calling.

15 Hulda P. Young Resigns as General Secretary-Treasurer Counselor

Marianne C. Sharp

The nearly eleven years of devoted service which Hulda Parker Young has given to the office of General Secretary-Treasurer terminated on November 15, 1967. Many life experiences have come to Sister Young in these busy and fruitful years. She married Elder S. Pitworth Young in 1965, and is now resigning from the General Board in order to devote her time to her husband and home duties. She served from January 2, 1957, until November 15, 1967.

Sister Young has given full devotion to her calling. She has always been eager to undertake any activity or attend any meetings which would better qualify her for her position. She felt the same desire for the secretaries who have worked with her and was always ready to advise and train them and to give them opportunity for advancement and progress. The trust reposed in Sister Young regarding the General Board minutes and Relief Society Annual General Conference minutes has been fulfilled, and she leaves the office with all matters for which she has been responsible up-to-date. She has always been enthusiastic in her work with a perception of what should be included in the report of proceedings. Her secretary-treasurer departments at the Relief Society Annual General Conferences have been of great help to the stake and mission secretary-treasurers. Sister Young has also fulfilled every assignment given to her as a General Board member, accepting assignments throughout the world where stakes are organized. She has evidenced a high regard and loyalty to the General Presidency, and has always been ready to carry out their wishes. She has had a clear insight into her position and anticipated needed changes, keeping abreast in her records with the phenomenal growth of the Church. Sister Young will be greatly missed by her associates of the General Board. Her cheery temperament, her friendly interest in people, her desire to do good, and her strong testimony of the gospel have all endeared her to those with whom she has worked. Relief Society workers throughout the world will wish happiness and satisfaction to Hulda Parker Young as she relinquishes her special calling in Relief Society.

IN HEAVEN'S SPRING

Gay N. Blanchard

Somewhere heaven's spring has lost
A misty orchard of old apple trees
Wildly spilling fragrance
From its vagrant boughs.

Seeking solitude for prayer,
I chanced upon its pale pink banks
Piled recklessly upon the green,
All drenched in sweet spring rain—
And held suspended there

Before a white-iced mountain,
Palely mist-miraged
With one low strip of cloud.

Breathless | stood As quietly
The hallowed hush enveloped me.
My solemn prayer that you would find
All joy, all truth, all peace of mind
Ascended with the lifting mist,
Potent with faith, Irrevocable.

Gay N. Blanchard
First Prize Winner
The Relief Society Poem Contest

One burning breath My heart cried out in fear,
Because | knew
That sorrow, searching, struggle, pain,
The price of such eternal gain,
Was also what I'd asked, My dear, for you.
Then gently as the falling rain
Touched face and hair and wet-lashed eyes,
A liquid cloak of peace distilled
And wrapped me round with Surety
That you would be enfolded, too,
With peace, and will And God's own strength to see you through.

All senses merged into the essence of that silent scene.
And there | knew
Whatever distance, time or space
Should intervene,
Our spirits always would be tuned
In fragile harmony...
And at some pale pink blossomed place
We would again touch hands
In heaven's spring.

Gay Nelson Blanchard, first Prize winner in the poem contest, is a newcomer to the pages of The Relief Society Magazine. She describes her poem, "In Heaven's Spring," as an actual experience which moved her so deeply that she had to put it on paper. 'This is the way most of my poetry is inspired," she relates. "Then comes the hard work."'
Mrs. Blanchard is the wife of Daren Blanchard, Cottonwood, Utah. They have six children, four daughters and two sons. The eldest son is serving a mission in New Zealand.

Sister Blanchard says that she is grateful and honored to have been chosen a winner in the contest. Her first published poem received an award in a college

ONE GOLD MORNING
Clara Laster
That morning when | felt the sheet-metal season move over me like a half breath,
Rushing moth-wing thoughts into turning a spring green, | shouted, ''But there are still oily clouds And white water standing hard against The morning; Icy patches of winter to suck my steamy breath Where | walk through low meadows. Mountains facing me, blue in their bones, Brimming spider webs of stone Like frozen statues caught in cement."
Silent as the core of snowflakes falling, God spread his creation before me,
Earth and aeons spoke a language Of work and trust.
That morning, | found my soul's limpid-longings. 1
There in that place, that hour, We found a marble pool piercing the frigid land like a silver dove in a cove of agate. It beckoned with the speech of law.
Clara Laster Second Prize Winner The Relief Society Poem Contest

Nerves and skin surrendered As | cried, "Baptize me now. So |, too,
Can brush shadows from the teeth of time, Until with faith our world Will shine."

Ill
Standing there where sacred moments Had burned with the fires of birth, | stood, sharpened against the wind And water, viewing the images Of the spoken word, spreading Upward, outward, inward, Endless and spaceless, Yet centered enough to fit into one Small capsule, Love.

IV
That morning when we left the heaven place, Still wet with willowy wings of faith, | was content.
And as the sun of noon galloped in To stop the hours in print, |! Walked away and knew The strength of steel that now was mine, Would be a binding thing. | would not forget that it was First tasted On a morning tucked behind the curve Of a golden winter.

"And Thou, Bethlehem"
Mabel Jones Gabbott

"And thou, Bethlehem, art not the least In Judah" The ancient words return And stir our memories of other feasts In Israel; how longingly did Rachel yearn To come again to Bethlehem to rest? Here Ruth gleaned for Naomi in the field Of kinsman Boaz and was greatly blessed; Young David, son of Jesse, would not yield To beast nor giant. "And thou, Bethlehem To whom we turn for pattern and for strength, Reserved for yet the sweetest diadem, Fulfills the prophecy, and at length Becomes the birthplace of our Savior, Lord; The fountainhead of truth: his life, his word."?
Sister Gabbott is the busy wife of J. Donald Gabbott, and the mother of two daughters who are both in college, and three boys who are in high school and junior high school. The family resides in Bountiful, Utah.
Sister Gabbott is currently serving as an editorial associate on the Improvement Era. She is a member of the Utah State Poetry Society, Bountiful Poetry Society, and Jessamine Literature Group of Bountiful, and is past president of the Salt Lake City Chapter of the League of American Penwomen. On winning, Sister Gabbott commented, "This is to me a great and beloved surprise."

The Relief Society General Board is pleased to announce the winners in the 1967 Relief Society Short Story Contest.
The first prize of seventy-five dollars is awarded to Emma Lou Warner Thayne, Salt Lake City, Utah, for her story "A Partridge in a Pear Tree." Second place winner is Mickey Goodwin, Vandenburg Air Force Base, California, for her story entitled "Eddie." Her prize is sixty dollars. Third prize of fifty dollars went to Sara Brown Neilson, Pasadena, California, for her story "More Than a Game."
The Relief Society Short Story Contest was first conducted by the Relief Society General Board in 1942, as a feature of the Relief Society Centennial Observance, and was made an annual contest in 1943.

The contest is open to all Latter-day Saint women who have had at least one literary composition published or accepted for publication in a periodical of recognized merit. The three prize-winning stories will be published consecutively in the first three issues of The Relief Society Magazine in 1968, along with photographs and highlights of the lives of the contestants. None of the winners has ever placed in a story contest previously, nor have they been represented in the Magazine.

Award winners

The contest was initiated to encourage Latter-day Saint women to express themselves in the field of fiction. The General Board feels that the response to this opportunity continues to increase the literary quality of The Relief Society Magazine, and aids the women of the Church in the development of their gifts in creative writing. Seventy-nine stories were entered in the 1967 contest, making it the largest number ever submitted. They came from several countries outside the United States, and from many states of the Union.

Prize-winning stories are the property of the General Board of Relief Society and may not be used for publication by others except by the written permission from the General Board. The General Board reserves the right to publish any story submitted to the contest, paying upon publication according to the regular Magazine rate. A writer who has received first prize two years consecutively must wait for two years before she is again eligible to enter the contest.

Gratitude is extended to members of the General Board and to the judges who evaluated the stories and selected the winning entries. The General Board congratulates the prize-winners on their fine stories.

First Prize Winner
The Relief Society Short Story Contest (up Partridge In A x ee Tree YJ "You sure are Harrow." "I hate Christmas! I hate going home, but it would be worse to stay here."

Jenny Harrow brushed a straggle of untinted, almost brown hair off her forehead and sank onto the familiar hardness of her desk chair. "But here we go again. Vacation, and another ordeal at home. If only I could just black out for two weeks and be right back here starting a new year." She whisked a stack of papers into a drawer, closed it deliberately, and stared unseeing at the suddenly very empty room. "After twelve years of teaching, you'd think I'd be used to it—going home, that is."

She knew that in seven hours Miss Harrow, the good school teacher, would be plain Jenny Harrow, unmarried daughter, home for Christmas. The tree by her desk, which moments before had been gay with tinsel and packages, drooped straggly and ill-shaped. The floor and the children's desks were littered with party leftovers. The sun, through the arduously tinted windows, fingerprinted the third grade efforts of seventy-two sticky hands that had glued and painted them.

Jenny was tired, but more than just "three-thirty tired." Far down the hall she heard him coming. The clomp and skid were unmistakable. It had to be Widdy. What had he forgotten now? Wondering, she shook her head and smiled. Two days ago it had been a stocking. Now, who in the world could lose a stocking—with his shoe still on?

When the class colored, Widdy never could find a black. "I don't like dark things anyhow, Miss Harrow." When they sang he never followed the words. "It's more fun to look up, Miss Harrow." In reading group he raced ahead and could never locate his place when his turn came to read. "I can't wait to find out what happens, Miss Harrow." Widdy could not wait for anything. Life was an urgent magnet, drawing him eagerly into its dynamic flow. And, with a wistful expectancy, he ran to it unimpeded by trivia such as socks and crayons, words and turns.

And now he panted into the doorway, his husky shoulders raised in a huge sigh. "Hey, Miss Harrow, I brought you something." He slammed a bedraggled package into her hands as if passing a stick in a relay. Then he slid, turned, and airplaned around the corner of the door. He caught the jam with his arm just before disappearing and thrust his matted blond head back into the room, smiling so hard his eyes almost closed.

"Oh, and listen, Miss Harrow," his voice was out-of-breathy. "I made that so you'd have it to hang on your tree when you go home. It's just like one we used to have that I liked a lot. But it got broke. And— He was suddenly sober. "And merry Christmas. You sure are a good teacher, Miss Harrow." He tipped his head pensively, then smiled again and was gone.

The clomp and skid down the hall echoed his hurry. Jenny looked at the box, its tissue clinging perilously to the misshapened container. It was easy enough to open. Inside, resting on a lumpy piece of incongruous cotton, was a tiny bird cage. It had been built of toothpicks, glued tenuously to key rings of three different sizes to create a kind of Japanese lantern. Except for a tiny gold ring at the top, it was painted green, with some of the excess paint oozing at the intersections. Inside the cage hung a battered little bell, suspended from the gold ring by a wire from a plastic bread wrapper. And glued onto the bell, its wispy feet one glob of goo, was a canary, cut out of a magazine, yellow on one side, a printed ad on the other. Its edges were irregular and it drooped a touch, but its identity was sure.

What a job for an eight-year-old! Thought Jenny, especially Widdy! She could picture his stubby fingers working with those toothpicks. How tedious. It must have taken him hours. She rested an elbow on the desk and dangled the cage by its Christmas ornament wire. It would make any tree. She stared dimly through the green bars, past the yellow canary and began hearing the only bird song she could associate with Christmas.

"And a partridge in a pear tree" yes "Four calling birds, my true love gave to me and a partridge in a pear tree." The first day of Christmas. Jenny peered into a long-ago living room. How long ago was it? Twenty-five years? Impossible. But there was the tree outlined against the window, the dark heaps of awesome newness silhouetted at its base.

Oh, how she had wanted that rubber doll—a real Dy-Dee-Doll! No one had ever had such a rubber doll before. You could really bathe it, and put powder on it and hug it hard. And it would feel so real. Corinne was asking for one, too. Then they could play with them together, maybe in Corinne's house trailer by the garage. She could let her new doll sleep in the special pink bed with the drawer under it for clothes, the one she had painted with Mother, the one they had made out of the "lug" the peaches came in.

Corinne said hers would be named "Geraldine." Jenny's would be "Florence" or "David," depending on whether it was a boy or girl. She always had to see what color the eyes were before she knew for sure.

On Christmas morning, Father made them eat breakfast first and then line up according to age to march in to the tree. She always felt sick with anticipation. They began their march, four brothers and Jenny, laughing "A Partridge In A Pear Tree" a little hysterically. Three times around. Each time they spied a new treasure. A basketball for the boys. A wagon, almost like new, for the littlest. A doll house, full of rooms and furniture, of course for her. She was the only girl.

But where? Where was her Dy-Dee-Doll?

Father turned on the lights and they sprang at their surprises from Santa. Ignoring the doll house, she searched frantically around the tree, upsetting gifts and even moving chairs.

"What are you looking for, Jenny?" Mother laughed.

"Santa wanted to surprise you with this playhouse. See, it has lamps and rugs and curtains."

"But, Mother, where's my doll?"

She had been so sure. They must have known how important it was.

"Oh, Jenny, those dolls—you wouldn't want one. They're poorly made and terribly expensive. Look, come and see how much fun you can have with this little house. You have other dolls."

Sometimes that winter Corinne let Jenny bathe her rubber doll. She was a good friend and she said she would let her tend her baby any time she wanted.

Jenny caught the bird cage in her hand. So now, Jenny, she thought, it's time to go home again. She laid it tenderly back on its lumpy bed and smiled at the thought of Widdy. She would take it home all right, and hang it in a place of honor.

She locked her room and walked toward the office for a final check of her mailbox. The halls were deserted and sounded with the eerie quiet of a silent 27 January 1968 school, unnatural and uncomfortable. The office door was open, across from the display case that still flaunted its Christmas joys.

Principals, she thought, must also be the last to leave the ship. But voices from the inner room meant that Miss Riley was not alone. Stepping gingerly through the outer door, Jenny headed for the mail slots. She heard the ordinarily calm Miss Riley almost shouting, "I'm aware that you have a problem, Mr. Reynolds, but you can't just accuse without proof."

"Without proof! Good grief, what does it take?" The man's voice was excited, but not belligerent.

"I saw this kid in the back yard by the pen. The gate's locked and nobody would just be walking through. What was he doing in there, if not stealing my bird?"

"Maybe he just wanted to look, Mr. Reynolds. This boy is full of curiosity—about everything. And he likes birds."

"Yes, I guess he likes birds! And he took my best pigeon. Every kid on the street saw him with it, and I haven't seen it since."

"Well, what's his story? Have you talked to him about it? Don't you think it would be fair to hear his side before you come charging in here accusing him? Why didn't you ask...?"

"T would have," the man interrupted. "I tried to find him, but no one was home at his house, as usual, and I figured the only place I would get any satisfaction short of calling the police was to come here. Most of the kids say you're fair and tough—well, that's a funny 28 thing to call a lady, but I need you to do something."

He paused and softened a little.

"I don't want to hurt the boy, but those pigeons are about the only thing I have that mean much to me."

"J understand your wanting to get the bird back all night, and I would like to help, but if you knew Widdy better...."

Jenny started. Widdy! Widdy in trouble? Widdy a thief!

Oh, who would have the nerve to accuse him of anything malicious!

She set her jaw to quiet her turbulent anger and strode uninvited into the inner office.

She looked into the dark eyes of Widdy's accuser, nicer eyes than she had expected, and blurted, "Why, Widdy Turner wouldn't hurt a fly."

Had anything ever sounded so trite?

The man looked to Miss Riley for explanation. She gestured a quick, "Mr. Reynolds, this is Miss Harrow, Widdy's teacher." Then to Jenny she said, "Miss Harrow, Mr. Reynolds' thinks Widdy stole his prize pigeon this afternoon."

"Think? I know. I saw him," he was firm.

Everything about him was firm, his forehead that ledged deep eyes, his jaw that worked, even when he wasn't talking, his hands that nudged a crease in and out of the hat he held.

Jenny thought, That crease doesn't have a chance.

"What makes you think—or as you claim—know this?"

Against her will, Jenny's voice mellowed.

"I know this boy like the back of my hand (trite again —sure sign of distress) and I know he's incapable of willful malice."

"Well, let me tell you about it then, since you're so sure. No thanks, I don't want to sit," he said to Miss Riley's sudden attempt to play hostess.

He half sat on her desk and looked directly at Jenny, appraising her tailored good grooming, though his eyes never left her face.

She shifted her weight, suddenly aware of a stray hair and of ankles never quite slim enough.

"This afternoon I came home early," he started. "I'm going on a new shift tomorrow. Nobody is ever home at my place in the daytime since my wife died, so I was surprised to see someone moving around in the yard. I was in the bedroom and it took a minute to get to the back door. By the time I did, he was gone."

"And it was Widdy you saw?" asked Miss Riley.

"Are you sure?"

"Sure I am. I know all the kids on the street. Sometimes I play football or baseball on the lawn with them. Keeps me in shape. Most of them are pretty good kids. Wish we'd had some. But, anyhow, this Turner boy seems sort of strange—never really part of the gang. He'll play for a while and then wander off without saying anything, not even 'so long.' But I know him."

"Oh, know him, Mr. Reynolds?" injected Jenny.

"From just watching him? From never having talked to him? Nobody knows Widdy that way."

He glanced at her but went on, "Well, anyway, a couple of minutes later I went out to feed the birds, and Blossom was missing. She couldn't have got out of the pen by herself. I knew that. So I walked out front to talk to the kids. They were standing around that big elm tree as they always do after school, even when it's almost freezing like today. There were tracks in the snow and I could see where someone had jumped the fence."

I asked the kids, 'Have you seen anybody with my pigeon?' They all nodded and one of them said, 'Yeah, Widdy Turner just went down the street with it.' So, as I told you, I went to his house. Nobody there. I didn't know what to do, but I figured you would. So here I am." He shrugged as if his case were closed. Jenny's mind whirred. How could Widdy have been in that yard and taken a pigeon and still have been here at school handing her a present, all at about the same time? School had been out—what—an hour and twenty minutes? He had been a busy boy. But what did he want with a pigeon—someone else's? And where was he now? Miss Riley filled the blank. "The only thing to do is find Widdy. Do you have any idea where he might be, Miss Harrow? Did he say anything at school?" "As a matter of fact, he was here, not ten minutes ago. He came back to bring me a gift. Come to think of it, I'd like you to see it." She found herself saying it much more to Mr. Reynolds than to the principal. "It would help you to know Widdy." She opened her large bag and drew out the crumpled box. Carefully she removed the lid and held up the curious cage. "He made this and gave it to me 29 January 1968 for my tree." She handed it to the man. He took it gently and fingered its fragile props. "Look at that bird," he said after intricate scrutiny. "The glue on its feet is still wet. He must have placed it on the bell and put the top on sometime since school, maybe even since I saw him in the yard. So what did he do with the pigeon in the meantime?" "Why don't we go back to your street and look," Jenny proposed, unconscious of a poised ease that had never been hers around men before. Miss Riley walked back to her desk and plumped into a chair. "You two go hunting and I'll get on the phone. If he's not home, someone will have seen him." Despite windows twinkling with Christmas tree lights, the neighborhood was cold and deserted as the early dusk turned the gray slush on the walks into crackling mounds and valleys. Jenny even found herself clutching Mr. Reynolds' arm as her three-inch heels wobbled for footing. "There's where he climbed the fence." He pointed, outwardly unmindful of her hand under his arm, but holding both hands and arm close in an unspoken welcome. "Come through the gate and look. Sorry I didn't have time to shovel again this morning." The snowy yard showed several sets of footprints, and theirs joined the pocked path to the bird pen in the far corner of the yard. Almost before Jenny could see the birds in the dim twilight, Mr. Reynolds gasped, "Hey!" 30 and ran toward the cage. "Look, she's here! Blossom's in here. How in the world?" He began examining the catch on the pen and motioned Jenny to join him. "That kid's put it back!" "What a relief! That Widdy—trust him to do the unexpected," smiled Jenny. "I knew if he'd taken it, it wasn't for anything mean. Which one was it anyhow?" "That one there, the one with the brown blaze on its head. See, the one with... Hey, wait a minute. There's something on her leg." He opened the door and reached for the pigeon. She snuggled with familiar ease into his open palms. He detached a piece of paper that had been fastened to its right leg with a wire from a plastic bread wrapper. Releasing the pigeon, he unfolded sticky layers of a note and squinted to make out its hieroglyphics. "Dere Mister Renalds," it began. "Here," said an amused Jenny, "this is my department. I've been translating for years." She took the wrinkled paper and read with little hesitation, even in the near-dark: DERE MISTER RENALDS, | BARROWED YORE PIGEN CAUSE | NEEDED IT FOR A EXPERMENT. | HAD TO SEE IF IT COULD BALENCE ON A BALL. THANKYOU. YOURS TURLY, WIDDY TURNER P. S. IT COULD. PSS MERRY CHISTMAS Jenny looked up from the note and into the nice eyes that still looked bewildered. She was glad of the half-light that might dis- guise the unexpected emotion that filled her. "That Widdy," she managed, "he had to make my canary authentic." Dan Reynolds put his hand on her arm. She could feel its firmness through her wool coat and interlining. He looked hard into her eyes that were now brimming with unashamed tears. He said softly, "You must be terrific—as a teacher I mean." Even Jenny's ears pounded with her pulse. The years of being almost happy melted in her glow. The agonizing Christmases of the past fell away in the magic of that moment of acceptance. So what if Roger Dixon had passed her up with his mistletoe in the seventh grade. And David Mace—what if he had left her standing by the fountain and sneaked off to the Christmas assembly with Judy? The echoes of failure ran distant now. "No, I'm not going to the Snow Ball" "Yes, Mother, I am chairman, but I haven't a date for the dance" "Yes, I'd love to be your 'A Partridge In A Pear Tree' bridesmaid" "No, I'm not the least bit superstitious about its being three times"... "Oh, Corinne, a baby in December... How wonderful!" "No, I'm not married yet"... "Yes, Father, I'll be home for Christmas I know, with all the boys gone...." Then, loud and clear... "You must be terrific!" It would never be the same. That elusive "partridge in a pear tree" the gift of the first day of Christmas—it was hers. Widdy had given it to her, and this man smiling down at her had confirmed the gift. All the Christmases of the past blurred into one big, bright image—of a canary, yellow and cocky, singing a jubilant carol as he balanced, just right, on a battered bell. Jenny laughed and kept looking into the nice eyes. "A good teacher, Mr. Reynolds? Yes. Yes, I am." She soared with the "Thank-Goodness-It's-Friday" feeling that only a teacher could know, and added, "And I'm going home for Christmas."

Mrs. Pratt Romney, a Latter-day Saint woman, who was first employed as a teacher in Colonia Dublan, Mexico, was recently honored by the International Senior League of the Los Angeles (California) High School Alumni Association as the "National Teacher of the Year." She was awarded a golden apple mounted on a pedestal, and a large document signed by the officials of the Los Angeles organization. Although Mrs. Romney has not been a 'regular' schoolteacher for forty years, her accomplishments are still bearing fruit and her influence is lovingly remembered. Kate Simon has written three readable, informative, and evocative guidebooks on New York, Mexico, and Paris. The last, "Paris Places and Pleasures" (Putman), is the best. All stir nostalgic delight in rereading after visiting these fascinating places. Mrs. Clydia Mae Richardson, who has been Chief of Presidential Commissions since 1943, was born and reared on a cattle ranch in South Dakota. She stamps State documents with the Great Seal of the United States. Adopted in 1782, the design of the seal is also on dollar bills. Dr. Marjorie Nemes is the only woman member of a team of four eminent researchers who are associated with the Merck Institute for Therapeutic Research, in attempting to find a new and effective defense against viruses. The four scientists are conducting experiments on substances which they hope will activate the cells of the human body to produce more "interferon," a mysterious component of the cells which, apparently, enables them to make effective resistance against certain types of viruses. Svetlana Alliluyeva, Stalin's daughter who defected from Russia to freedom in the West, plans to give a 'substantial part' of the high-figure proceeds from the serialization of her book about Soviet Russia to the United States for charitable purposes. Part will also go to the Pestalozzi project in Switzerland, where refugee children from many nations are learning to live together and like each other. 32 EDITORIAL With the responsibility which the Lord has placed on parents in regard to their responsibility toward their children (D&C 68:25-28), mothers will give anxious watchcare today to the welfare of their daughters. Especially, during these troubled times, do they need to give special attention to teenagers to guard against some current social trends and fashions that, if adopted, could adversely affect the future of their daughters' lives. The adverse influence of some of these is so subtle as to be almost unrecognizable until it takes over in the life of a young girl. Some extreme fashion trends are becoming a commonplace mode of dress and seem to have won general acceptance, with a failure to see any particular harm in them. A case in point is the present miniskirt fashion trend with skirts seeming to grow continuously shorter and less modest. The Church has always taught the importance of modesty in dress. There is no question as to the present need for emphasis on this teaching. Latter-day Saint parents, particularly mothers whose influence upon a girl is a potent one, should accept the counsel of Church leaders and teach their daughters by example and wise counsel satisfactorily 'to withstand the popularity pressure of the mini-skirt and other types of immodest clothing. They will assist their daughters to make their own clothing if this is necessary to preserve modesty. Mothers will make sure their own attitudes and dress are in harmony with Church teachings if they expect their teen-age daughters to grow into exemplary Latter-day Saint women.

Bay Resigns as a Member of the General Board # General Board members and sisters throughout the Church will regret the resignation of Josie B. Bay from the General Board as of January 1, 1968. She has served since May 26, 1948. Her departure comes after nearly twenty years of service on the General Board, during the last fourteen of which she has served as Manager of the Temple and Burial Clothing Departments, and, more recently, of the Garment Distribution Centers, as well as Director of Mormon Handicraft Gift Shop. Her loss will be keenly felt. Sister Bay had been stake Relief Society president of two California stakes before her husband, Ira M. Bay, moved his family to Salt Lake City and Sister Bay was called to the General Board. In addition to her daily attendance at Relief Society headquarters, she has also carried out her General Board duties, serving on practically all of the committees and visiting the stakes throughout the world on conference assignments. Sister Bay is blessed with many talents in the business field and has a humble, teachable personality with great love in her heart for her fellow workers and an understanding heart. She leaves the Board to devote her full time to her husband and family, however, one may be sure she will continue to serve her sisters in the Church as she may be called or as she may volunteer to do. The united love of the Board will go with Sister Bay. Her service to Relief Society will ever stand as a memorial to her in the sound practices she has established under the General Presidency during the past vears of phenomenal growth.

On behalf of all Relief Society sisters, love and appreciation are extended to Sister Bay and her husband and family, who have unselfishly and devotedly supported Josie B. Bay throughout her long years of valued service to Relief Society.

SONG PRACTICES
The recommended program of Relief Society provides two ten-minute song practices each month—one on the Social Relations day and the other on the Cultural Refinement day. We urge choristers to use wisely this time in teaching the sisters to sing beautifully and meaningfully the familiar Latter-day Saint hymns and also to train them to sing some of the less familiar hymns. These, we feel, would contribute significantly to the spirituality of all Relief Society meetings.

_Birth Defects— hectrot yer i [ * The National Foundation—1968 March of Dimes ~ = = _  
George P. Voss
Vice President for Public Relations

The National Foundation-March of Dimes marks two milestones during 1968: the 30th Anniversary of its founding as a voluntary disease-fighting organization—and the 10th Anniversary of its entry into the field of birth defects. With one great victory—the conquest of polio—achieved, the uniquely successful March of Dimes partnership of scientists and laymen is now moving forward against an even greater destroyer of health and life through an intensive assault on those killing and crippling birth defects whose conquest had been for centuries regarded as hopeless. But there is hope. Modern medicine can correct many defects. Research may one day lead to the preventives that will make correction unnecessary. Contributions to the March of Dimes support treatment and research. Children with birth defects can be helped, and the March of Dimes is helping them.

The extent of that help is determined by the generosity of an informed public.

A moving picture on the lake,  
Where waters winter-bound  
Have made a polished looking-glass  
Of beauty lost and found.  

The skaters glide with rhythmic ease,  
Their arms, like wings, are free,  
And links of silver laughter weave  
A mesh of buoyancy.  

Then like flamingoes flying low  
They skim across the screen,  
And distance paints a miniature  
With silent ice between.

(DSUZanne is seven years old)

Did you ever stop to think, Suzy, that you and I never seem to have an argument?  
I think it must be because you understand me better than the others do.  
If there weren't any arguments, there wouldn't be any help for some of people's troubles. Sometimes it is good to have an argument. That's a pretty deep thought, sweetheart, and I agree with you.

The main thing is people should love each other. Well, honey, you can be sure I love you.  
I love you with all my heart. You shouldn't just love one person.  
You should love everyone in the family. You should love thousands of people. Love is the most important thing there is.  
I guess if everyone believed that—and I wish they did—there wouldn't be any divorces or riots or wars. This world would be happier.

I! Wish you stayed home more, Dad. Well, honey, you know I have to work hard to support the family, so we can have this nice house, cars, and clothes and everything.  
I want you children to have things better than I did when I was a boy. But, Dad, you shouldn't work on Saturdays and Sundays. You should spend more time with the family like Mr. Caine does with his.

Life isn't just for working. Life is to live and to enjoy.

MAKE A HANGABOUT APRON
Shirley Thulin

When is an apron not an apron?  
' \ When it's a "hang-a-bout." These new front coverups are so practical and so easy to make you will want several. The teenagers in the family will especially like them because they are so easy to slip into, and have no middle ties to pull in and crease their no-waistline dresses while they help with Sunday dinner.

This apron is made from a terry towel —nice for the cook who is constantly wiping her hands. Another handy feature is the easy-to-slip-into neckband, for keeping the hairdo in place. You will need a large-sized kitchen towel or hand towel. Pick one which is bright and cheerful, and one that has fringe on the ends.

You will also need the yoke pattern to a muu-muu or other round-necked slip-on garment, for the neck must be large enough to need no placket or other opening.

For the yoke, choose cotton fabric of a bright solid color to match one of the colors in the terry.

TO ASSEMBLE

Cut out the yoke pattern. It will usually be four pieces (figure 1).  
Stitch both front pieces to both back pieces at the shoulders. Now you will have two circles with shoulder seams (figure 2).  
Turn up and baste a narrow hem 1/4 inch around all raw edges of both circles (only turn this 1/4 inch once).

Cut off the fringe from one edge of the towel. Make two small tucks in the towel, about two inches from the selvage edge as you baste the towel to the front edge of one of the circles (figure 3). Be sure to center the towel to the front part of the circle.

Now place the other circle on top of the circle which has the towel basted to it, wrong sides together. Now zigzag, or bind with bias, the two circles together all around the outer edge and also around the neck opening.

If you use bias tape, it will have to be top stitched across the edge where the towel is. Now your "hang-about" is finished (figure 5).

She has four children, ten grandchildren, and eleven great-grandchildren. Each of them has received a quilt made by grandma, especially for him, as well as many other gifts of handiwork. Sister Lords enjoys making gifts for her family and for Relief Society, and is especially glad to have the opportunity to work on quilts with her Relief Society sisters.

42 Mrs. Pleasant — Nziés Pierson Litenfen # I shall call her that, because I think of her when I hear that adjective. We met many years ago, when my husband and I had been married for only a few months. An older man with whom my husband worked at the office invited us to his home for dinner. The remarks of this man's lovely wife have made indelible impressions on my mind. The dinner was a veritable feast; yet, I remember less about it. As I helped with the dishes, my eyes lingered on the "Thursday" pattern I was holding, and I remarked about the beauty of the hand-worked towel.

"Oh, that," she said, "was the poorer one. I think we just have some Thursdays and Mondays left. The children like the other designs better." She took me with her into the boys' rooms while she got the small children into their pajamas and sent them into the bathrooms to get their baths and teeth brushed. She seemed well-organized, loving, and very patient. They responded to her with sincere devotion.

When they were both clean and dressed, they appeared in the hall, ready for the session of what their mother called "horseplay." Mrs. Pleasant maintained that all tiny folks needed to be tired and happy before bedtime. She allowed them one-half hour in the playroom at the end of the bath session, timing them by the clock. I noted

43 January 1968
that she had one cupboard up high in the room, in which she kept first-aid supplies. I watched the twinkle in her eyes when she admitted that these supplies were sometimes useful after a nightly workout.

"My husband and I feel that children need to play 'roughhouse' now and then," she said, smiling. When the little boys were tucked down into their beds, she said we could have a good talk. Our husbands were in the den, and the older children were busy in the dining room doing their homework. We went back to the playroom. The comfort of the children had been paramount in the planning of that room. Mrs. Pleasant stated that it had taken five years to complete this room to specifications. Rocking horses, painted floor games, basketball equipment, and an extensive children's library of books and musical recordings made the room a haven of fun. There was a noticeable lack of dolls and girls' toys, of course, but the Pleasants had no daughters.

I stood in awe at the material blessings that had been bestowed upon the Pleasant children.

Their mother, a cultured university graduate, sat down on one of the lounges beside me and sighed, "You know, dear, we were not always able to buy such furnishings as we have now." Little by little, she shared the details with me. "My father was a doctor, and my husband's people had a successful business. They felt there was no reason for us to live in the 'cubbyhole' we rented. However, we wanted to feel independent. It's true, we had quite a struggle while my husband was getting through college; the only money we had was what I could earn as secretary to the dean of engineering." Later, Mrs. Pleasant worked at home, doing typing for the professors, in order that she could be with the first, and then the second child. By this time, Mr. Pleasant had a part-time position, instructing at the college he attended. The tiny suite in which they lived was close to the campus, which saved transportation expenses. Mrs. Pleasant said she had tried to run her miniature home like the best and most orderly office. She had received a degree in business administration, making it possible for her to "understand her husband's language." The two of them learned to budget realistically. They took year-end inventory, to decide on purchases for the future. In allowing themselves few luxuries, they were able to start a small savings account at the bank. They had two rules in those days: first, only one movie or dance a month and dessert once a week, usually on Sunday. "When you look at our home now, you, I realize, can hardly believe that once we got by with apple-box cupboards—apple boxes were free from our grocery store. I painted them and made attractive drapes out of very inexpensive print, bought as remnants. In the fall and spring, I would rent a sewing machine for a week, to keep things in good condition and myself clothed. For the five-dollar fee, I could sew what I needed. I can see that little portable now, on top of our dresser. Oh, we called it a dresser, although it was simply another set of apple boxes, draped, with a mirror on top. Every inch of space in that apartment-room was at a premium." She told of an incident that indicated clearly the dimensions of the room. "One night, when we had both gone to sleep, Mother knocked at our door. It was after midnight, but we had no phone. She had come to bring us the news of Uncle David's accident. She said that Father was working on him in the operating room. By the time I got my husband awake and the bed lifted up into the wall closet, in order to open the door, Mother seemed upset, and we heard her grumble, 'To think that an only child, a daughter of mine, would have to live like this!' You see, she often forgot the early challenges of her marriage, when Father was attending medical school." Mr. Pleasant had a good sense of humor, and when there would be the least breakdown in office-home management, he would come to the rescue with such comments as, "Has our file clerk taken ill? Under the heading on this file, 'Dry Folded Diapers,' she has filed absolutely nothing!" Mrs. Pleasant always retaliated with laughter, suggesting facetiously that he fire the file clerk immediately. Then Mr. Pleasant would announce, in dramatic alarm, "The room is too crowded. I am afraid I shall never be able to find the file clerk. There is hardly room for the baby!" Mrs. Pleasant, the night of our visit, summed up her thoughts with the remark that all women ought to learn to enjoy what they can afford to own. Last week, a young married woman came to my home, obviously disturbed because she did not have some of the worldly appliances which my husband, after years of planning, had provided for our family. I felt impressed to tell her about Mrs. Pleasant. She had complained, "Why, you should see our apartment! It is no bigger than my office used to be, when I worked as a receptionist, before our marriage. I am ashamed to invite anyone to our place." A letter came in my mailbox today from her. She climaxed her remarks with these comments: "Too many of us young wives are not willing to sacrifice while our husbands are getting started. We expect now what our mothers have taken a lifetime to have. We need more Mrs. Pleasants! She has made me happy, once again, to live out of our suitcases and cardboard boxes. Thank you for letting me meet her!" A POEM Caroline Atterton 'Write a poem,' says she as plain as can be! As plain as the nose on your face! I'll do what I can—the best that I can! But I warn you—it takes just this much space. 45 Chapter 5 Throw Down the Gauntlet Janet W. Breeze SYNOPSIS: Nancy Jackson, with two children, accompanies her husband, Grant, on a teaching assignment to the Island of Truk. After a brief stopover on Guam, the family arrives on Truk, where a quonset hut becomes their home. However, Nancy is told by a native doctor that she will have to go to a hospital on Guam for the arrival of twin babies. In the meantime, the family observes the Sabbath and hears part of the Tabernacle Choir broadcast. A letter arrives from the Mortensens, their friends, saying that the Jackson family will be welcomed by the Mortensens on Saipan, and that another teacher has been found to exchange teaching assignments with Grant on Truk. » The sign was painted white, and the black letters read: "Welcome to Saipan—Capital of Micronesia." The dismal looking concrete and clapboard buildings with corrugated steel roofs were also white, and the dust from the crushed coral road gave the vines of purple Bougainvillea an eerie pastel appearance. "That's downtown," Francine Mortensen pointed out, "Chalan Kanoa, the main village. However, whenever anyone on the hill tells you he is going to the village, it just means he is going shopping, because there are villages and stores dotted all over the island. Mostly, though, we stick to the two stores which are air-conditioned and carry the widest variety of American foods." "That was one thing that really surprised me about Truk," Nancy said. "Truk trading—they carried just about anything one could think of. I really came out to Trust Territory prepared for a steady diet of raw fish and coconuts!" Francine laughed. "Have you eaten any raw fish yet?" "No!" "Well, you're bound to before long. Sashimi is the most popular party food on the island—raw tuna covered with soy sauce and lemon juice." "I like hot dogs and mustard," Grant said. "Sashimi's all right if you like the smell of raw fish," Charles Mortensen said, "because that is exactly what it tastes like." "Take you shopping. Tomorrow, Francine said. "The Ladies' Welcoming Committee left enough food in the quonset for you until then."

So you can just take it easy today." 'Listen,' Charles said, turning a bit in the car seat to glance back at Nancy and Grant, "about the quonset. I hope you won't mind it. But since school has already started, the houses are all full." "We're quite used to quonset living now," Nancy laughed. '"Besides—people need things to look forward to. And we can dream about teachers terminating and leaving empty houses - next summer!"' "Now, that's the right attitude to have," Francine said. "I can tell right now, you two are going to get along here just great!" Amy and Skipper watched wide-eyed out of the windows as the car sped along Beach Road. "It's much more jungly here than it is on Truk," Nancy said. "Oh, that's just our boonies." Francine laughed. '"Tangen-tangen, actually. But back in Navy days, I guess someone started calling it the 'boondocks,' and now even the Saipanese call it the boonies. There really is other growth back in there. Tangentangen is not native to Saipan at all. But the entire island was so devastated and burned off by flame-throwers in the war, that the Government seeded this stuff by air to keep the soil from eroding. Now it's twenty feet high, and so dense one can't walk through it except with a machete. But it does provide the Saipanese with lots of good firewood for their outdoor cooking. And privacy? Well, you'd never know there was a house on the island!" "Look, Mama!" "Chickens!" "Yes," Charles said. "Our one and only chicken farm on the whole island, where eggs are large, fresh, and only one dollar a dozen." "Oh, not here, too," Nancy said. "That's one thing I am still wondering about. Our food budget has exactly doubled." '"There's one way to beat that," Charles said, "get used to local foods, and forget those canned and frozen imports. Now Francine puts together a salad of fresh pineapple, papaya, and avocado that will make you forget what lettuce even was!"' "I also know 199 ways to prepare rice," Francine teased. "And that reminds me, Nancy, better put rice and soya on your shopping list. Your house girl will eat it every day for lunch." Then she laughed to herself. "You know? Before we came out here I had one tiny bottle of soy sauce that lasted four years, and it was still only one-third gone. Now we go through one quart a month! Honestly, sometimes I think Olympia drinks it! But then, I shouldn't say anything. I use a lot more of it now, myself." "Excuse me," Grant said, "but did you say our house girl?" "Oh, yes. I hope you don't mind. I went ahead and lined up Amy §s said. 47 January 1968 a maid for you. Actually, I don't refer to Olympia as our maid, even though that's what the girls call themselves. Somehow, the word maid always brings to my mind a uniformed servant drawing a bubble bath, while her lady eats breakfast between pink satin bed sheets! And it's nothing like that out here at all. In the first place, the Saipanese expect you to employ them; and in the second place, these girls are used to the climate and don't mind one bit standing over a hot ironing board all day." "I have noticed my ironing increase," Nancy said. "It seems we are forever taking showers and changing clothes." "Right. So I hope you'll forgive me for employing Soledad." Nancy rested her head back on the seat of the car and closed her eyes. Maybe it would be nice having help, after all, especially with twins. It seemed such a long time since the day Grant had thrown her life into a turmoil by asking if she had ever heard of Micronesia. She hadn't really rested her mind since. Maybe, with a house girl, she would be able to unwind from the whole overwhelming experience of being uprooted so abruptly. And it would give her more time to spend with Amy and Skipper. But the first thing I want to do when I get home, she thought, is just to sleep, and sleep, and sleep. The Mortensen car climbed the long winding road to the top of Navy Hill, made its way around a broad clearing marked off as a ball field, and stopped in front of a bright yellow garbage can decorated with oversized daisies. In the doorway of the quonset stood a short but large Salpanese woman. "Soledad," Francine said, as they got out of the car, "this is Mr. And Mrs. Jackson, Amy, and Skipper." Soledad leaned over, wrapped her huge brown arms around Skipper and whisked him up into the air. "I like babies," she said. Skipper screamed and kicked. "I not a baby! Put me down! Put me down!" Soledad complied with his wishes, shaking her finger at him. "Baba patgon lahe!"' "I'm terribly sorry," Nancy said. "I hope he didn't hurt you. He's probably just tired from the trip." 'Baba patgon lahe!' Then she waddled toward the car to get the suitcases, as the rest of them went into the quonset. Nancy whispered to Francine, "Doesn't she speak English?" "Oh, yes. What she said was that Skipper was a bad boy. She speaks English all right—but gets frustrated in pure Chamarro!"' Then Charles reached out and put an arm each around Grant and Nancy. "You don't know what it means to us to have you here," he said. "You'll never know. We've been the only Latterday Saints on the island for six years. This is a very special day in our lives." "Which reminds me," Francine said, "I usually hold Primary with our girls on Wednesdays after school. So why don't I take your children home with me and bring them back afterwards, and you can rest." "Don't you want to come to Primary?" Grant asked. "Take it easy today," Charles laughed. "Next week you can be president! And let's see," he began counting on his fingers, "with Francine playing our piano for Sunday School, we can also use a chorister. And with more children, we will need a new Sunday School teacher so we can split the membership into age groups. Then we have made it a practice to hold our Family Home Evening on Sunday afternoon to discourage the children from wanting to go to the beach with their friends. And after they're in bed Sunday evenings, Francine and I usually read the lessons in The Relief Society Magazine and discuss them. Anyway, rest today. You'll have lots to do from now on." "Sounds marvelous!" Nancy said. "For the last month, I have felt totally inactive." As Grant stood at the window and watched the Mortensens drive away with Skip and Amy, Nancy opened her suitcase and began to look around for places to put things. "I do dat!" Soledad said, grabbing a pile of clothes. "But I don't really know where I want to put them yet," Nancy said. "I show you." And away she went down the hall to the bedroom. Grant turned around smiling.

TI guess she told you." Nancy shrugged her shoulders, threw down the gauntlet, and continued sorting through the suitcases, while Soledad came back for more. "I saw a box of soap powder on the washer," Nancy said. "Would you mind washing these few soiled clothes we brought with us, Soledad?" "You buy soap in yellow box!" "What's the matter with the soap in the blue box?" Nancy asked. "Yellow box get clothes clean! American magazine say so!" Grant turned his head and tried to keep a straight face, while Nancy walked out to the kitchen to wash the clothes. Then Soledad began singing "I Wanna Hold Your Hand," at the top of her voice, as she dragged the heaviest suitcase toward the bedroom and then returned. 

Nancy lifted a root-bound Philodendron, resting in a foil-covered jar, down from the top of the refrigerator. "This thing needs water," she said, holding it under the faucet. But as the water spilled up over her hand, so did something else. And as two black, beady eyes stared up at her from the back of her hand, Nancy screamed, dropped the bottle, and shook all over.

"Nancy!" Grant said. "It's only a harmless little gecko!"

"It was a lizard!" "You scared him!" Soledad accused. "You scared him! Gecko good luck. And you scared him!"

Nancy looked at the two of them, shrugged her shoulders in defeat, and walked toward the 49 January 1968 bedroom. It was the middle of the afternoon, but the bare bed with the cool white sheets looked inviting, so she crawled in between. Her legs ached from sitting so long on the plane, and her head ached just because.

As a sudden shower began rattling against the quonset, Nancy closed her eyes and tried to imagine what it would be like to have a baby on Saipan. Francine had already warned her about the rose-colored bedding—the philosophy being that Dr. Torres' was a low-budget hospital; that Japanese dye was cheaper than American bleach, so they used color to prevent the sheets from wearing out so fast. Francine had also told her to keep her suitcase packed with everything, including silverware, personal items, and towels—even a jug of drinking water, unless she liked the chlorine density of village water.

Thinking about Francine made Nancy smile and begin to relax into sleep. How good it would be to have a friend who understood.... But sleep seemed only a snatch in the dark when she felt someone shaking her.

"Why you slipping so long?" "Tam slipping," Nancy echoed, "because I am tired!"

"It's four o'clock. Bus coming. I make bed. You move!" Nancy obediently got up and walked slowly down the hallway to the living room.

"Just think," Grant said, "if she were an automatic modern appliance, you could turn her off! But she'll be back tomorrow morning at seven-thirty. And the morning after that, and the morning after that."

Nancy slumped down into the couch cushions and looked as if she wanted to cry. "I can hardly wait." (to be continued)

Dorothy J. Roberts

He was made to lark the fields of night,
Song out of silence in the birth of light.
Hear him singing in the dark alone;
He was made for longing deeper than the bone;
Made for enduring in the root
That we might, hungering, partake of fruit.

He was made for shadow and weight of snow;
He was made for darkness where lush things grow.
He was made for midnight and for pain,
The somber silence and the spoken rain.

The cookie village consisted of a rock candy schoolhouse, a gingerbread house, and two other houses made from a variety of cookies. Christmas scenes placed inside the houses consisted of Mr. And Mrs. Santa Claus, stockings placed at the fireplaces, and even a kitten on the rug. Outside, Christmas lights on the houses delighted the children as they saw Santa going down the chimney of one of the houses.

Elevated above the village was a cookie church with an ice cream cone steeple. Members and nonmembers alike look forward to this event each year."

SPIRITUAL LIVING—The Doctrine and Covenants Lesson 87—"Be Thou Humble" (D&C 112:10) Elder Roy W. Doxey (Reading Assignment: Doctrine and Covenants, Section 112)

Northern Hemisphere: First Meeting, April 1968
Southern Hemisphere: September 1968

OBJECTIVE: The Latter-day Saint woman views her own life in light of the commandment to be humble, with the great promised blessings.

INTRODUCTION
The Prophet Joseph Smith wrote that, during the year 1837, a spirit of speculation in lands and property of all kinds, which was prevalent throughout the country, took hold of the members of the Church. Out of this practice other evils developed, such as faultfinding, evil-surmising, dissension, and apostasy. He said that no quorum of the Church was entirely exempt from the influence of these evil powers, and that even some of the Twelve Apostles were overcome with this spirit. Amidst this unrest and apostasy, the Lord revealed to him that "something new must be done for the salvation of His Church." (DHC II:487.) As a result, the first foreign mission of the Church was organized under the leadership of Elder Heber C. Kimball of the Quorum of the Twelve. Consequently, in June 1837, he was set apart to preside over the missionary work in England. The same day the gospel of Jesus Christ was first preached in England, the Lord gave Section 112 for the special benefit of Elder Thomas B. Marsh, President of the Quorum of the Twelve, and also for the other members of that Quorum. (DHC II:487-499.)

A TRUTH FOR EVERYONE
Especially important for Elder Marsh was the following truth: Be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers. (D&C 112:10.) Throughout the Doctrine and Covenants there are revealed truths which, though addressed to individuals, are nonetheless applicable to all members of the Church. These scriptures are known as universal truths because of their applicability to everyone. Such is the one quoted above.

FOLLOW THE MASTER
The exemplar of humility was the Savior. He was completely submissive to the will of his Father in heaven. Premortally Jesus was one of the Godhead and Creator of many worlds before he came to earth. (Moses 2:26; Colossians 1:16-17.) In that life he desired that the fulness of honor be given to the Father at the time of the Council in Heaven, when decisions were reached concerning the eternal advancement of the spirit children of the Father. (Moses 4:1-4.) In the plan of salvation, Jesus willingly submitted to the will of the Father in becoming the Atoner of man. (John 17:4; Luke 22:39-45.) Every member of the Church should reflect upon the cost of the atonement made by Jesus, for the price was very great in terms of suffering. (D&C 19:15-19.) During his ministry he became the pattern for all men. In regard to baptism, which he taught was essential, Jesus showed the way by humbling himself before the Father in submitting to baptism. (2 Nephi 31:5-10.)

CLASS DISCUSSION
If you were to follow the Savior in the virtue of humility, what kind of changes would you make in your life?

WHY HUMILITY?
The first answer to a query by the Latter-day Saint as to why he should be humble is that God has commanded men to be humble. The benefits of being humble must also give the answer to the need for this virtue. If humility is to submit oneself to the will of God, then it follows that salvation in his kingdom is obtainable only through this virtue. (Mosiah 3:18-19.) What, according to the revelations, makes of this quality the pathway to salvation? Obedience to the commandments is the first essential. (Matt. 7:21.) The Lord blesses the person of humility. In what ways?
(1) He "shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers." (D&C 112:10.)
(2) The Lord's Spirit enlightens the humble. (Ibid., 136:33.)
(3) "Let him that is ignorant learn wisdom by humbling himself" (Ibid., v. 32.)
(4) The promise of seeing and knowing the Lord is made to the humble. (Ibid., 67:10.)
(5) His arm of mercy is extended to the humble in freeing them of bondage. (Mosiah 29:18-20.)
(6) The weak are made strong and are thus able to fulfill other commandments. (Ether 12:26-27.)
(7) They receive knowledge. (D&C 1:28.)
(8) The blessing of assisting the Lord in his work comes to the humble. (Ibid., 12:8.)

LESSONS IN HUMILITY
As the Savior ministered unto all, even to the giving of his life, so we also should become the servants of all in exercising the virtue of humility. (Matt. 20:25-28.) The apostle Paul testified that he had made himself servant of all that he might gain the more. (I Cor. 9:19.) Might not Latter-day Saints develop the quality of humility, as commanded, in order that they also "might gain the more," even life eternal?

Six months after the Church was organized, the Lord gave a revelation for the benefit of Thomas B. Marsh, the same person who is the subject of the revelation from which the scripture-theme of this lesson is taken. He was counseled to govern his house in meekness. (D&C 31:9.) But he failed to be sufficiently humble when his wife was convicted of a dishonest deed. As a result, Brother Marsh, in a period of disaffection, left the Church because of his lack of humility. Due to his pride and arrogance and unwillingness to follow the leadership of the Church, he apostatized while President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, in 1838.

HOW TO DEVELOP HUMILITY
Among the ways by which the virtue of humility may be acquired are the following:
(1) to place one's full trust in Jesus Christ as his Atoner;
(2) by fasting and prayer;
(3) through diligent study of the plan of salvation;
(4) by being teachable; and
(5) elimination of vices opposed to humility.

TRUST IN CHRIST
The first principle of the gospel is faith in Jesus Christ as the Only Begotten Son of God. As the Savior of men through the atonement, he satisfied the demands of justice and mercy for all men. (Alma 42:5-15; Moroni 7:39-42.) The humble person recognizes that there is no salvation in this world nor in the world to come without faith in Christ as his Redeemer. (2 Nephi 9:6-13.)

FASTING AND PRAYER
One of the most beneficial practices to develop humility is to place oneself in subjection to the Father through fasting and prayer. By fasting one shows his willingness to subject his physical appetite to his own will and to God's will by keeping the commandment. Sometimes one must force himself to obey and thus, in gaining one victory, he is prepared for other accomplishments.

President Brigham Young once said that if a person did not feel like praying, he should get down on his knees and stay there until he felt like it. (Journal of Discourses 16:28.) By yielding one's heart to God in fasting and praying, one becomes stronger in faith and humility. (Helaman 3:55.)

DILIGENT STUDY
It seems inconsistent to believe that a member of the Church can be ignorant of the principles of the gospel and remain fully subject to the Father. Certainly, no man can be saved in ignorance. (D&C 131:6.) To do the will of the Father, it is necessary to know what his will is. The Prophet Joseph Smith said that if a person did not get knowledge, he would be brought into captivity by some evil power from the other world. (DHC IV:588.)

The humble person is he who has a deep, abiding faith in the Lord. Elder John A. Widtsoe has pointed out that the extent of a person's faith depends in part on the amount of his knowledge. The degree of faith possessed by any man depends not upon the extent of his knowledge but upon the certainty of his knowledge, which leads to the proper use of his knowledge. (Joseph Smith, Deseret News Press, Salt Lake City, 1951 edition, p. 163.)

An important factor in having the assurance of gospel truth is not only to have an academic knowledge of the gospel but also to receive the Spirit of the Lord testifying of its truth. President Brigham Young, in this way, admonished the saints to receive this blessing: Let us be humble, fervent, submissive, yielding ourselves to the will of the Lord, and there is no danger but that we shall have His Spirit to guide us. (Journal of Discourses 13:155.)

Class Discussion
Show why a knowledge of the gospel can develop humility.

BEING TEACHABLE
An important phase of humility is teachableness; that is, the ability to place oneself in harmony with the principles of the gospel. The person who is unteachable, hard to accept revelation, lacks the necessary humility. The comparison between the adult who is saved in the kingdom of God and the little child best illustrates the quality of teachableness and the need for it.

The Savior placed a child before his disciples and gave two requirements for them to enter the kingdom of heaven: (1) become converted; and (2) become as little children. His closing point was: Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. (Matt. 18:1-4.)

Reliance upon the scriptures was enjoined upon the Church by the Twelve Apostles, in 1838, as follows: Be careful that you teach not for the word of God the commandments of men, nor the doctrines of men, nor the ordinances of men, inasmuch as you are God's messengers. Study the word of God and preach it and not your opinions, for no man's opinion is worth a straw. Advance no principle but what you can prove, for one scriptural proof is worth ten thousand opinions. (DHC III:395-396.)

Class Discussion
What makes a humble person teachable?

ELIMINATION OF VICES
The last suggestion as to how one may develop the quality of humility is to eliminate every barrier to one's success in that development. The vice found in the revelations which is opposed to humility is inordinate pride. Inordinate pride has several manifestations, such as boasting and vainglory. Pride is condemned in the scriptures because it is the opposite of humility. It is self-esteem arising out of one's possessions, position, or accomplishments.

The apostle John wrote: Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father but is of the world. (I John 2:15-16.)

Boasting is a manifestation of pride. When people boast about their wealth, education, business ability, physical prowess, or works of righteousness, they lack humility. Vainglory is extreme self-pride or excessive ostentatious vanity. The apostle Paul counseled nothing be done in vainglory but that all should esteem others better than themselves. (Phil. 2:3.)

Class Discussion
Should the Latter-day Saint believe that he should eliminate all pride from his life, or that inordinate pride is the evil?

HUMILITY IS STRENGTH
The gospel of Jesus Christ extols humility as a prime requisite to eternal life. Submission to the will of God is the key to happiness here and eternal joys in the life to come.

As already mentioned in this lesson, the Savior was the epitome of meekness. In his promise to the faithful he declared that, in accepting him, one would receive rest to his soul, for he was "meek and lowly in heart." (Matt. 11:29.)

Service to others is an integral part of the gospel plan; consequently, one may understand why humility is a basic ingredient of that plan, for without humility the greatest service to man would not be rendered.

Jesus' humility did not conflict with his strong condemnation of the Pharisees and lawyers who ignored the spirit of the law. (Luke 11:37-54.) He vigorously taught the truth without fear, even to the giving of his life for that truth. (Mark 14:43-65.)

The person possessed of humility is strong. Living the gospel gives strength over weakness. Assisted by the Holy Ghost the member of the Church rises above the base, worldly vices and, being armed with truth and righteousness, is possessed of a power that may eventually culminate in the powers of godhood.

Class Discussion
Explain why one can be humble and yet be forceful in his promulgation of gospel truth.

IMPLEMENTATION
To be humble requires submission to the will of the Father as instructed in the gospel of Jesus Christ. The objective of this lesson will be realized when those who come within its influence learn why the Lord requires that his people incorporate this virtue into their lives. It will not be accomplished until each person develops a program of soul searching to determine wherein he lacks the qualities which are found in the truly humble person.

VISITING TEACHER MESSAGE—Truths To Live By Message 7—Courage and Love
Alice Colton Smith
Northern Hemisphere: First Meeting, April 1968
Southern Hemisphere: September 1968
Objective: To be a loving friend or a good neighbor may require courage. Have you ever wronged someone with gossip, angry words, or false accusations? When you met her next how did you feel? Was it easy to be friendly? Did you tend to avoid her? Have you ever had a friend who fell into disfavor, committed a crime, or made mistakes which made him despised, disliked, or scorned by others? Have you known someone who was highly esteemed one day and without money, power, position, or influence the next? Did you immediately or eventually react differently to him?

To admit a wrong, to endure rejection, disappointment, misunderstanding, to risk safety, security, reputation, well-being, for an unpopular but righteous cause, or for the love of a friend requires courage. "There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear." (I John 4:18.) Dr. Jones was a brilliant woman, contributing much understanding to the world. She was busy and immersed in her work. She rejected her neighbor, Sister Link, who was not of her faith, and she barely spoke to her. Repeated attempts by Sister Link to be a friend had been rebuffed. One day, seeing Dr. Jones out in her garden, Sister Link had the courage to try again. She went over and said, "I wish I could grow such beautiful flowers. Do you have a moment to tell me how you do it?" Dr. Jones' garden was her avocation. Within the hour she had given both advice and flowers to Sister Link. Now Dr. Jones goes over often to inquire about how "our" plants are doing. During a recent illness of Sister Link's husband, she even brought food to the family.

Another woman, a Mrs. Schmidt, no longer spoke to her next-door neighbors. The neighbor's children broke her windows, threw trash in her yard, lined bottles up against her home and woke her up in the night by breaking them with stones. Mrs. Schmidt grew afraid of them and avoided them. Her daughter-in-law came to live with her for the summer. She said, "Mother, they can't be all bad. Maybe they behave so because they are ostracized by all the neighbors." One day, the daughter-in-law took them some newly baked bread. The children and delighted. Repeated kindnesses began to have an effect. The daughter-in-law heard her explain firmly that such language should not be used. The offending children never spoke such words again.

Through her courageous love, the children responded with respect and love. It takes courage to find ways to love when one is rebuffed and rejected. To lead out while others wait is not easy. Serving God and one's fellow men without the approval of friends and neighbors requires conviction and fearlessness.

As we grow in a TO THE NEW OWNER Ruth G. Rothe

Be careful as you walk along the path
The plants close by are young and fragile there,
They must be given very gentle care
Especially around the white bird bath.

The rooms are done in pastel simplicity, 
Not very modern as compared to some; 
But I am sure that you will soon succumb 
And share their offering of felicity. 

Yes, this has been a place of joy supreme,
Where children's laughter echoed.
But now stark silence burdens all the walls
And I must find another place to dream.

So, if you plan some changes in this my cherished home,
But one small thing I ask, let it remain 
Just as it is, till I am out of sight.

HOMEMAKING—Development Through Homemaking Education Discussion 7—The Bedrooms—Wake Up Smiling Celestia J. Taylor Northern Hemisphere: Second Meeting, April 1968 Southern Hemisphere: September 1968 OBJECTIVE: To show that comfortable, attractive, quiet bedrooms can contribute to the physical well-being of the family.

NOTE: It will be necessary to adapt this discussion to the circumstances of the sisters living in the various areas of the world. It must be remembered, however, that these discussions aim to raise the standards of homemaking and should be adapted with this in mind.

INTRODUCTION

During the past few months we have been discussing the different rooms of the house in their relation to and their effect upon the family who lives in them. The bedroom, which is our immediate concern, is the most intimate as well as the most personal of all the rooms in the house. It is at once a refuge—for it shuts the world out—and a sanctuary—for it shuts us in. We should come back from that private world of sleep physically refreshed and spiritually renewed.

While keeping in mind the individual differences of the family members—the likes and dislikes, the dispositions, the ages and sexes, and other pertinent considerations—and the adaptations which may be necessary in each case, we are aware that there are some qualities which are basic to any bedroom if it is to produce the desired results. 66

It should be clean, comfortable, and convenient; it should be pleasant and attractive; and it should insure privacy and quiet to those who will occupy it.

THE BEDROOM SHOULD BE COMFORTABLE

What is complete comfort in a bedroom today? To begin with, it is the difference between just a room to sleep in and a place where everything is conducive to sleeping comfort. Such comfort doesn't require a large room or an excessive expenditure of money, but it does require organization of space and wise planning of the furnishings for convenience and comfort. Any bedroom can be comfortable if these requirements are met.

One of our most modern decorators says, "Many people aren't nearly as comfortable in their bedroom as they might be. And it's not because they need a great deal of money to spend there—it is just because they haven't given the question any thought at all." What you sleep on—the mattress and springs—plays a big part in determining whether or not you will get the refreshing sleep that relaxes muscles and releases tensions built up during the day. You should buy the best mattress that you can afford. Economize on the bed itself rather than on the mattress and springs. Very attractive beds can be improvised at a cost which will more than offset the amount spent for the best mattress and springs.

The best mattress to buy will be the one which is best for you—the one, whether hard or soft, which contributes the most to your comfort and health. The quality of your bedding and the importance of its being just right for you cannot be stressed too much. The size and weight of the bedding, and kind of pillow, the degree of light, the temperature—all affect the comfort of the sleeper and thus the quality of the sleep. A noted psychologist says, "Indulge your slightest whim in connection with the comfort of your sleeping environment. Anything matters if it helps you improve your sleep."

THE BEDROOM SHOULD BE PLEASANT AND ATTRACTIVE AND QUIET

If there is one room in the house where you should be more happy and more at ease than any other it is the bedroom. The more pleasant this room is, the more rejuvenating will be the hours spent there. Good rest stems from more than a comfortable bed, important as that bed is. If the room is gloomy and unattractive, these qualities destroy whatever other virtues that room may have. On the other hand, a pleasant, attractive environment can have a positive therapeutic value.

Surroundings which please the eye and appeal to the esthetic senses of sight and sound and touch will improve the quality of sleep and invite forgetfulness of the worries and stresses of the day. Certainly, then, your bedroom deserves to be the most attractive place you can possibly make it. Here, again, the emotional effect of color should never be underestimated. With the intelligent use of color you can bring life, added warmth, and an actual feeling of glow to an otherwise lifeless room, or you can bring an atmosphere of rest and relaxation to one which lacks these qualities. You can even use color to give the illusion of added space to a small room or achieve the opposite result when a room is "barny" and needs to be made more intimate and cozy.

To Discuss: Discuss available sources for obtaining ideas in achieving color harmony and other decorating skills. Harmonious bed linens, draperies, and rugs add to the restful quality as well as to the beauty of the bedroom. When space is limited, the use of mirrors can double the apparent size of the rooms. The correct use of light and appropriate light fixtures can do much in helping to create an attractive environment. The more soft materials there are present the more subdued will be the sounds. Soft carpeting and draperies hung in folds rather than straight will also help to lessen the sound. Joints and hinges on doors and drawers and furniture can be made free from squeaks and harsh, grating sound by the application of a lubricant or a little carpentry work.

To Discuss: A pleasant and attractive bedroom is an individual responsibility.

CONCLUSION Since one-third or more of life is spent in sleep it is imperative that the mother make every effort to provide for her family a desirable place where healthful, adequate rest may be obtained. SOCIAL RELATIONS—A Light Unto the World Lesson 7—Home and the School Alberta H. Christensen (Reference: A Light Unto the World, Melchizedek Priesthood Manual, 1967-68) Northern Hemisphere: Third Meeting, April 1968 Southern Hemisphere: September 1968 OBJECTIVE: To point out that an understanding of the purpose of education, at all levels, is of value to both mother and student. INTRODUCTION This lesson points out some general purposes of education and emphasizes areas where the Latter-day Saint mother may give support to her children and to the school. Church views relative to education are stressed. Although academic requirements, organizational patterns, building facilities, and the means of supporting schools' vary throughout the world, some objectives are basic and common to all public and to all Latter-day Saint operated schools. It will be well for the class leader to select for full discussion, areas of the lesson which apply specifically to her group, using the nomenclature of her particular country.

THE HOME AND EDUCATION Education begins at home. It is there that the infant makes first contact with the realities of earth life, with all its tools for learning. He learns to observe and to know, through seeing, through hearing, and through personally experiencing. The home is thus of first importance in education, and the first four or five years are especially important. The home, however, is not equipped to give specific training in skills needed in today's complex world; it is not equipped to give scientific nor technical training commensurate with the world's demands. It is obvious that some formal education, either private, church, or public, is essential and invaluable.

Questions 1. What is the home equipped to give, generally, relative to education? 2. Where and when should character training be given?

CHURCH VIEWS ON EDUCATION The Latter-day Saint point of view relative to education is expressed by President David O. McKay as follows: The Church stands for education. The very purpose of its organization is to promulgate truth among men. Members of the Church are admonished to acquire learning by study, and also by faith and prayer, and to seek after everything that is virtuous, lovely, of good report, or praiseworthy. In this seeking after truth they are not confined to narrow limits of dogma or creed, but are free to launch into the realm of the infinite, for they know that "Truth is truth where'er 'tis found, Whether on Christian or on heathen ground." Indeed, one of the fundamental teachings of the Church is that salvation itself depends upon knowledge; for, says the revelation, "It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance," (D&C 131:6) and again, "... If a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come." (Ibid., 130:19.)... True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature, or art, but in the development of character. (David O. McKay, Gospel Ideals, pp. 440,442.)

President Brigham Young speaks of education and the Latter-day Saint in the following words: We should be a people of profound learning pertaining to the things of the world. We should be familiar with the various languages, for we wish to send missionaries to the different nations and to the islands of the sea... We also wish them to understand the geography, habits, customs, and laws of nations and kingdoms.... How gladly would we understand every principle pertaining to science and art, and become thoroughly acquainted with every intricate operation of nature, and with all the chemical changes that are constantly going on around us! How delightful this would be, and what a boundless field of truth and power is open for us to explore! We are only just approaching the shores of the vast ocean of information that pertains to this physical world, to say nothing of that which pertains to the heavens, to angels and celestial beings, to the place of their habitation, to the manner of their life, and their progress to still higher degrees of perfection. Our education should be such as to improve our minds and fit us for increased usefulness; to make us of greater service to the human family; to enable us to stop our rude methods of living, speaking, and thinking. We shall never see the time when we shall not need to be taught, nor when there will not be an object to be gained. I never expect to see the time that there will not be a superior power and a superior knowledge, and, consequently, incitements to further progress and further improvements. (John A. Widtsoe, Discourses of Brigham Young, pp. 254, 255, 248.)

Class Involvement: Discuss briefly how the Church view of education supports the principle of eternal progression. CHURCH SUPPORT OF EDUCATION From the foregoing quotations it is evident that the Church recognizes the value of both secular and religious education; that it encourages its members to take advantage of opportunities to gain knowledge and to use it constructively in their daily lives. The Church so strongly believes in the value of formal education that it has established and maintains many schools, embracing different levels of learning.

Some of these schools are located in areas where there are few other opportunities for education. In some cases, it would not be available otherwise. The schools enumerated will indicate how world-wide is the influence of Church support of education.

MEXICO—thirty schools, twenty-eight of which are elementary

AMERICAN SAMOA—one high school

WESTERN SAMOA—three elementary and one four-year high —school (Church College of Western Samoa)

TONGA—eleven middle schools (fourth, fifth, and sixth grades) and one high school

TAHITI—one elementary school

NEW ZEALAND—one college, with training equal to four years of U. S. High school plus one year of college work, English school pattern

UNITED STATES—one junior college (Rexburg, Idaho), one business college (Salt Lake City, Utah), one liberal arts college (Hawaii), and one large university (Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah)

SOUTH AMERICA—three elementary schools (Santiago, Chile) 70

Some idea of the importance of Church interest and influence in the field of education may be gained when we consider that, as of May 1967, there were 187,707 students enrolled in Church operated, general education schools, including Seminaries and Institutes of Religion.

Class Involvement

1. What place does the home occupy in this vast educational program?

2. How can the mother, generally, help her children receive maximum benefit from these schools?

THE CHURCH AND HIGHER EDUCATION

All who have followed the growth and development of the Church know that its leaders have ever been mindful of the importance of higher education. Even in the early days of Nauvoo, when the Restored Church was in its infancy, plans for higher education took their place beside those of city building and domestic commerce. We read that the leaders hoped the city would become an educational center, for already steps had been taken towards founding a university, and the keen interest which President Smith and his followers had ever manifested in education, gave every promise that Nauvoo in time would be one of the prominent centers of higher education in the United States. (A Comprehensive History of The Church, B. H. Roberts, Vol. 2, p. 180.)

Due to persecution and expulsion of the saints from Nauvoo, this dream was not realized. It did, however, find fulfillment in the valley of the mountains with the founding of the University of Deseret, only three years after the pioneers entered the Salt Lake Valley. This institution later became the University of Utah, and is now State operated.

Brigham Young University, founded in 1875, now most nearly represents the dream and planning of the Church for the advanced training of its members. It is the largest institution of higher learning in Utah and there, in a generally cultural and religious atmosphere, classes in religion, as well as those of a strictly academic nature, are a part of the curriculum. Included in its large and increasing enrollment, are some Church members from Europe, the islands of the Pacific, South America, Asia, and North American Indians.

THE CHURCH AND RELIGIOUS EDUCATION

The Church so strongly believes in formal religious education that it has established and maintains seminaries and institutes of religion in areas where there are enough Church members to warrant them. The purpose of the seminary, to teach the principles of the gospel, is accomplished through an organized study of the standard works of the Church. Embraced in the courses are such values as the responsibility of good citizenship, obedience and respect for law, respect for the rights of others, and love and appreciation for home and family. Students of high school age are thus given more intensive religious training than the Church auxiliaries, meeting but once a week, are equipped to give.

A large selection of elective religious courses are taught by Lesson Department an able faculty at each of the institutes of religion for the benefit of college students and other interested adults.

Class Involvement

1. Where can the Latter-day Saint mother obtain information regarding the seminary program? (Consult home teachers or your bishop.)

2. In what specific ways can the mother encourage her children to take advantage of this religious training and otherwise cooperate with the program?

THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL

Various situations often make it neither possible nor feasible for some young people to seek college or advanced university training. Fortunately for these individuals and for society, vocational schools (called trade or apprentice schools or the technical college in some areas) offer excellent educational opportunities. Here occupational training is given to prepare the students to become auto mechanics, laboratory technicians, practical nurses, carpenters, machine-dye fabricators, and for many handcraft industries. These individuals fill an essential role in today's growing economy. In some areas they materially reduce unemployment problems.

SPECIFIC PURPOSE OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL

The elementary school program ordinarily introduces a child to formal education. Here he is given experiences which form the foundation for all later education, and, as such, are extremely important. Specific purposes and patterns of organization may vary widely in different countries where Church members attend school. Generally, however, the objectives for public instruction of the young are in harmony with the following purposes:

1. To teach children the basic skills of reading, writing, and mathematical reasoning.

2. To help children develop and maintain desirable habits and attitudes for healthful living, and to promote emotional stability through experiences which make them feel wanted, successful, and important.

3. To help children develop a sense of moral values which will prompt them to act with respect for self and ethical concern for others.

Class Involvement

1. To what extent may the home reinforce or nullify the purposes of the elementary school?

2. Where can honesty in taking examinations and other school activities most effectively be taught?

3. How important to the student is the mother's affiliation with a parent-teacher group, in areas where such exist?

JUNIOR AND SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL

The junior and senior high school program, representing in the United States ages about twelve to eighteen, provides training to meet needs of the adolescent and young adult. The students further their interest, among others, in industrial arts, literature, homemaking, history, foreign languages, music, art, student government, speech, drama, and physical education. They learn to be more critical in observation, more individually responsible for their own actions.

In spite of this stimulating program which embraces needed and challenging objectives, far too many students fail to finish through the high school.

Class Involvement (Select one or two:)

1. How important may a mother's attitude toward education be, in keeping her children in school?

2. Which, in your opinion, is most likely to cause high school dropouts: (1) lack of motivation; (2) inability to keep up with academic requirements; (3) failure to adapt to social situations; (4) desire to make money?

EDUCATION ON COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY LEVEL

Attending a college or university is costly. It is, therefore, important that both student and parent know (1) what may be gained from higher education, and (2) what general conditions may be encountered.

Since the student goes to college to learn, and to enlarge his understanding in many areas, he may expect to receive a training, by qualified professors, that will help him earn a living and make him more useful to society. He may expect to have facilities for study and regular classes without disturbance. Many professions require advanced educational training.

For Discussion 1. What benefits may one expect to obtain through a higher education? 2. What ways are there to accumulate means to finance a child's higher education?

THE NEAR FUTURE

Challenging experiments in the field of education are being carried out today. It is believed by progressive educator groups that children, even infants, can be taught some disciplines of education at an earlier age than has been generally believed. They believe that through suitable motivation and increased ability to read, learning capacity may be increased and behavior problems forestalled.

Latter-day Saint mothers may profit by becoming alert to the advances of new methods and techniques, when they have been found to be useful and of permanent value.

SUMMARY

The Church teaches that we cannot be saved in ignorance. It therefore encourages and supports both secular and religious education as a means of acquiring knowledge. The Church also teaches the importance of the home in establishing and maintaining attitudes receptive to those teachings which make for good, wholesome, and useful living. With such cooperation, we may then eventually understand why "The glory of God is intelligence." (D&C 93:36.)

CULTURAL REFINEMENT

Ideals of Womanhood in Relation to Home and the Family Lesson 6—''The Substance of Faith" Elder Robert K. Thomas (Textbook: Out of the Best Books, Volume 3: Intelligent Family Living by Bruce B. Clark and Robert K. Thomas)

"Faith is the substance of things hoped for." —New Testament, Hebrews 11:1

Northern Hemisphere: Fourth Meeting, April 1968
Southern Hemisphere: August 1968

OBJECTIVE: When her life is lighted by eternal principles, a woman can live both in and above the world.

(Note to Class Leader: A consideration of the painting "Life From Death" by Floyd E. Breinholt, American Painter, and Associate Professor of Art, Brigham Young University, and his commentary thereon, as printed on page 688, 691, of the September issue of the Relief Society Magazine, will be a part of this lesson.)

This lesson opens with a consideration of Matthew Arnold's well-known poem "Dover Beach":

The sea is calm to-night. The tide is full, the moon lies fair
Upon the straits;—on the French coast the light
Gleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,
Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.
MS January 1968

Come to the window, sweet is the night-air!
Only, from the long line of spray
Where the sea meets the moon-blanch'd land
Listen! You hear the grating roar
Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling
At their return, up the high strand,
Begin, and cease, and then again begin,
With tremulous cadence slow, and bring
The eternal note of sadness in.

Sophocles long ago
Heard it on the Aegean, and it brought
Into his mind the turbid ebb and flow
Of human misery; we
Find also in the sound a thought,
Hearing it by this distant northern sea.
The sea of faith
Was once, too, at the full, and round earth's shore
Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furl'd.
But now I only hear
Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,
Retreating to the breath
Of the night-wind down the vast edges drear
And naked shingles of the world.

Ah, love, let us be true
To one another! For the world, which seems
To lie before us like a land of dreams,
So various, so beautiful, so new
Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,
Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;
And we are here as on a darkling plain
Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight.
Where ignorant armies clash by night.

This poem has been so often analyzed and so widely praised for its imagery and diction that its message has almost assumed a minor role. Critics dismiss Arnold's suggestion that faith in human love must replace religious faith as a typical nineteenth century reaction to scientific discoveries which were calling many accepted beliefs into doubt. If such criticism is valid—and the perspective of a century would seem to support such a view—perhaps we need to see what this poem tells us about the religious faith it is so willing to abandon.

Arnold's basic image—faith as a tide—suggests that he does not expect religious faith to remain constant. As waters rise and fall, so faith may be more evident (or perhaps more possible) in certain epochs. Even more interesting is the secondary image of faith as a "bright girdle." The obvious picture here is a decorative sash or belt encircling the world. The connotations of such an image are revealing: Faith may be attractive but it is binding, restrictive. It also tries to include too much. Such a concept of faith implies an emphasis on conventional religion rather than on God. For it is quite possible to fall short of joy, peace, love, light, and help for pain if our devotional efforts are focused in forms and creeds.

The tragedy of this poem is not that religious faith is impossible, but that a mechanical substitute for a dynamic belief in God should be assumed to be religious faith. In one sense this poem may have been written before its time. Only a few of Arnold's contemporaries were moved by it in spite of its metrical finesse and beautifully modulated imagery. It is the twentieth century to which this poem speaks its cosmic sadness.

FOR DISCUSSION

Why is Arnold's shift from religious faith to faith in human love liable to be disappointing?

For Discussion Why does Santayana suggest in the last few lines of his sonnet that only the heart can be led to "thinking of the thought divine''? "FAITH" BY WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN The most famous orator of his day, William Jennings Bryan, next outlines the kinds of faith which a man who wants to achieve must have. In the story which follows' this_ selection, "Jacob and the Indians," too long to be included here, Stephen Vincent Benét lets us see a young man who exemplifies the four kinds of faith Bryan had asked for: faith in oneself, faith in others, faith in country, and faith in God. For Discussion List the ways in which Jacob Stein has grown up between his two _interviews with Raphael Sanchez. "THE TIDE OF FAITH" BY GEORGE ELIOT, AND "A GOOD NIGHT" BY FRANCIS QUARLES George Eliot's "The Tide of Faith" repeats the image used by Arnold and in so doing shares some of Arnold's problems. George Eliot was the penname of Mary Ann Evans (1819- 1880). Self-educated for the most part, she read widely and became proficient enough in languages to translate both Feuerbach and Spinoza. By 1858 she had written her first prose fiction. With Adam Bede, in 1859, she _ became famous. Despite her unquestioned success as a writer of prose, she persisted in writing poetry, and a small number of her poems were printed. Today, only the famous line "O, might I join the choir invisible" is widely remembered from her poetic work.

The smiling conscience in a_ sleeping breast Has only peace, has only rest. The music and the mirth of kings Are all but very discords, when she sings; Then close thine eyes and rest secure; No sleep so sweet as thine, no rest so sure. Note how the long vowel sounds of Quarles' diction reinforce the mood of peace and certainty. The opening couplet and the closing one have identical rhymes, suggesting the very state that the words secure and sure stand for. For Discussion There is a lullaby quality about Quarles' "A Good Night." Why. Beyond the title of this poem, is such a mood appropriate? "THE WILL TO BELIEVE" BY WILLIAM JAMES The final selection for this lesson is taken from a_ wellknown defense of faith by the distinguished philosopher, Willam James. The entire essay from which these excerpts are taken repays close study, for James brilliantly turns the skeptic's own arguments against him. Note how he warns the reader that if he is so prejudiced against religion that no religious explanations are possible, he need read no farther. How, neatly, this puts the skeptic in the position he has so often accused the believer of holding, that is, re- 77 January 1968 fusal to consider alternative possibilities. In language that is rarely technical, James very tactfully suggests that skepticism may not be the only position that an intellectual can hold.

His most telling point here is that insisting we put off a decision until the evidence is totally convincing, is not to avoid a choice. In such a state we have already chosen: and we have chosen to say no. In stating that the "faith-vetoer's" position is "better risk loss of truth than chance of error," he makes the skeptic appear more afraid of religion than the believer is of human reason. It is refreshing to see a beautifully logical mind brought to the support of a position which has often seemed overwhelmed by logic. Belief has never asserted its validity in the face of evidence. Faith, as the Bible tells us, is what we must use when the evidence is yet to be seen. Our whole lives are ventures in faith. We must believe in ourselves to undergo the discipline which prepares us for exacting and satisfying work; we must believe in others if the mutual benefits of civilization are to flourish; we must have faith in a country and a government if we are to live without fear; and we must believe in God if the whole fabric of our lives is to have meaning and significance.

For Discussion In the light of James' argument in "The Will to Believe," what might we say to a person who decided to let his eight-year-old child wait until he could choose for himself whether to be baptized into the Church?
