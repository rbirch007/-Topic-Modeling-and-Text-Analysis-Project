COMPASS FOR A CHILD Peggy Tangren

What will you remember when the roads you take  
Narrow and dead-end against your mind?  
Memory will have mileposts leading back  
To these high fields  
Where now you run in meadow rue  
Rocked by wind, and reach,  
Knowing some day you will be  
Tall enough to part a cloud  
And gather down an armful of clear sky.  

Where visions fade in fog and then are lost,  
In crowded places sharp with hurting sound,  
You will know the stillness of deep water,  
For you were born of tranquil places,  
Of mountain tops cleaving lanes of air.  

You have followed corridors of light  
Through darkened forests,  
And been nurtured on summer's sweetest yield.  
This will be your compass when you go—  
Your magic shield.

161 Ranch. This gives me an opportunity to fish language. I admire very much the Relief Society Magazine for the joy it brings to my husband, because it is a source of great initiative and knowledge of the gospel. The Relief Society Magazine fulfills its uplifting, and edifying purpose, and the drawings are ideal, for they are beautiful and instructive. I can, with confidence, express my thanks to you for maintaining such a high standard. May the Lord bless you for maintaining the Lord's work so that our children read this Magazine. Mrs. J.

Or a college graduate, I had never learned to appreciate poetry until these last few years, plus the combination of the Out of the Best Books series and my wonderful cultural refinement class with leader, Violet Larsen, have finally helped me to love and understand poetry. Helen F. Cheney Downey, California  

Although I am not a poet myself, I enjoy the Magazine so very much. It is superb, with its lovely Madonna cover, and so many beautifully arranged homes in memory of the birth of our Savior. I especially liked Lisi Lund Cole's poem "Christmas Is the Same" so much. I knew Christie when I lived in Springville and belonged to the League of Utah Writers. I used W. B. Jones last Sunday.

Arm in Arm With the Priesthood [Address delivered at the Stake Board Session of the Relief Society Annual General Conference, September 28, 1967.]

Elder Romney, Sister Spafford, brothers and sisters, the Lord must be very pleased with the activities of these two days. The Lord's pleasure can only be complete, however, as we now implement what we have been taught during this conference. So, the true test really lies ahead as we put ourselves into action.

Why does the mere mention of the words Relief Society renew my faith? Why do I thrill each time I see the sisters accomplishing their noble work in a quiet, unassuming manner—without boast, no show, just unobtrusively "seeking out objects of charity?" During the past thirty days, I have observed you quietly administering consolation and assistance to a family who lost a loved one. I have seen you gracefully and compassionately comfort the sick. I have seen you faithfully going forth to spread your tidings of good will as visiting teachers. I have seen you 164—faithfully going forth to spread your cheerful countenance and to ably and willingly respond to the motion that filled found 4 note inside which read: "May the Lord bless thing like one in a me. J tarried little too long in help Ng to deliver a baby. Yes, visiting teachery can really be CUGITINE in the South Pacific, Oo, Perhaps I get little istyeyed because I remember go well the day when a Relief Society Mother asked SS10n pregnant to give her baby a name and a blessing and then added almost as an afterthought, "Please Heavenly Father to restore eyesight. Your baby was born, and you have the Priesthood of God." Miracles did not end 2,000 years ago, nor hope of one Relief Society mother who declared in my hearing I have waited for twenty years, and will wait hundred more if need be, because I want to spend eternity with the father of my children. He is a good man, and I know that one day he will come into the Church." 

Sisters, there is an old saying, "First things first," and I would like to make a plea with you ere today that in your bazaars Ith your ventures Ith your personalities that are different from yours men. There are things on Can most effectively ACCOMPLISH March 1968 you. Just keep in mind the direction found in your Handbook, and that singular, noble purpose will never be found wanting.

That printed direction from your Relief Society presidency states that your main purposes are: To manifest benevolence, irrespective of creed or nationality; to care for the poor, the sick, and the unfortunate; to minister where death reigns; to assist in correcting the morals and strengthening the virtues of community life; to raise human life to its highest level... To save souls. (Handbook of Instructions of the Relief Society of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.)

Oh, that every woman in the world had such a code to live by! What a different world this would be.

In discussing this important speaking assignment with Sister Spafford and her counselors, the suggestion was made that something might be said that would be helpful in fostering a closer understanding between the ward Relief Society presidents and the bishops. I took the liberty of inviting several bishops to make comments upon their working relationship with the Relief Society presidency of their ward. I thought some of their observations were classic, and I would like to pass them on to you this afternoon.

While the examples are from bishops, the same fundamentals would apply, of course, in a branch or mission, as well as in the ward or stake. One bishop said this: "Our Relief Society president is always ready with excellent counsel, and once the bishopric makes a decision, she supports us all the way." This statement could well have been made by the First Presidency of the Church with reference to your general president.

Nothing has thrilled me more than to see the cooperation of Sister Spafford and her counselors in carrying out the desires of our leaders. You will be interested in a recent comment made in my hearing by a member of the First Presidency when he said that he had never known a woman who supports the priesthood any better than Sister Spafford.

Sister Spafford, we salute you for your great example. It reminds me of a slogan, "Which way to go, the leader will know." I hope every stake president and bishop is able to make this same observation about his stake or ward Relief Society president. To be sustained in Church leadership is vital to the success of this Church. Nothing means more to a leader than to be sustained by those working with him.

President Tanner related a touching incident on one occasion as he told about his first counselor when he served as a bishop of a ward in Canada. An important decision had to be made. President Tanner and his first counselor had differing opinions about the solution. They decided to fast for twenty-four hours, that the final decision might be correct. After the fast, it was obvious that each was still of the same opinion, and then Brother Tanner stood up and said, "Brethren, as the bishop of this ward, I feel strongly that this is the way we must move." At that point, that great first counselor came to his side, put his arm around the bishop, and declared, "Bishop, I want you to know that I sustain you all the way."

You see, the priesthood authority had spoken, and now this is the direction we move.

Recently, a General Authority had just expressed his views on a vital subject, and afterwards was informed that the President of the Church had just given his view, and that it was different. This great apostle of the Lord then commented without hesitation: "In that case, brethren, I have just changed my mind."

We must follow our properly designated authority in this Church. Should we fail in this concept, chaos would reign. The work could not go forward.

May I be bold enough to share with you sisters a very personal incident that took place just six years ago this week as President McKay honored me with this call to be a member of the Presiding Bishopric. Naturally, there was a period of quiet emotion after the invitation was made. Then as we stood, ready to take our leave, President McKay walked directly to Sister Simpson. He took her by the hand. He proceeded to look deeply into her eyes and into her soul, and his patient silence and kindly smile seemed to be an invitation for her to comment.

Finally, she said, "President, I want you to know that I will support and sustain my husband in this new calling." With that, President McKay said, "Sister Simpson, that is exactly what I wanted to hear." There can be nothing more fundamental in the Church than a faithful sister supporting the priesthood, whether it be her Relief Society Arm in Arm with the Priesthood husband, or her designated authority in the ward, stake, or mission. Here is another comment from one of our ward bishops: "I never need to worry about confidential matters slipping beyond the Relief Society presidency." The duty and the right of being a common judge in Israel, among the members of the wards and stakes rests with the bishop. This is his unshared ward responsibility. Stake presidents have the same stake-wide responsibility. Each ward bishop, of course, has that jurisdiction only within the membership of his own ward. It is his right alone to conduct the personal, private, searching interviews into the hearts of the ward members. This is necessary in determining personal worthiness and in order for him to be most helpful. No other officer in the ward has this same right, and, as bishop, he determines the need, then administers the necessary assistance through the appropriate priesthood or auxiliary leader of the ward. It is often necessary to share certain segments of confidential information. Very often that appropriate person is the Relief Society president. To repeat such privileged information needlessly, to pass it on as neighborhood gossip, or even to share it in the supposedly airtight family circle, would surely be a gross violation of the sacred trust placed in you. It is my own personal opinion that violators of such a confidence will be held accountable by the powers of heaven. May I share this comment from a bishop in Arizona: "She never resorts to guesswork. Our Relief Society president knows her program and also has an excellent concept of the priesthood and its functions." The Lord admonishes us through the Doctrine and Covenants: Wherefore, now let every man learn his duty, and to act in the office in which he is appointed, in all diligence. He that is slothful shall not be counted worthy to stand, and he that learns not his duty and shows himself not approved shall not be counted worthy to stand....(D&C 107:99-100.) There is a small part of your day, every day, that you might set aside better to learn your duty in Relief Society. How about five o'clock in the morning, if no other time seems right? I think it is important to find an island of time every day when you can improve yourself in your calling. Unfortunately, there are those in the Church who feel that programs can be changed at random merely to meet temporary whims or conveniences. Through Priesthood Correlation, each program becomes a part of the total fabric of the Church. No program can be considered an island. Due to Correlation, everything is now interrelated as never before. To take liberty with a single program is to distort the whole. Be assured, sisters, there is a reason for each phase of the Relief Society program as it is today. It is our fervent desire that you will have the faith to follow the program. This should have been the commitment and heartfelt agreement of each Relief Society president as she accepted her call. Should there be a sister who cannot wholeheartedly accept the program for which she has been given responsibility, she has a moral obligation to meet with her priesthood authority for a serious talk at the earliest moment. Only as we believe in and have confidence in the programs we administer can we be effective in their implementation. "For if a trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?" (I Cor. 14:8.) So spoke Paul to the saints at Corinth. Still another grateful bishop made this observation: "Our Relief Society is a beehive of activity. All the women are anxiously involved, thanks to a Relief Society president who radiates faith and encouragement as she involves everyone about her." We have often heard it said, "How much more valuable is the man who can get ten men to work as contrasted to the man who can do the work of ten men?" This is a Church of involvement for many. There is no place for the prima donna. Surely the Lord gave sound advice to Moses as he found himself overburdened with administrative details and the multitude of daily problems that persisted as the Israelites moved across the wilderness. Moses was told "... Thou art not able to perform it thyself alone." He was then advised to organize his people into groups of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens, with leaders over each unit to take care of the immediate problems, and then to bring to Moses only the major matters. Then the Lord concluded: "... So it shall be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee." (Exodus 18:15-22.) I might add, they shall share the blessings with thee. And this, I repeat again, is the very essence of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is important for a Relief Society president to free herself for those duties that she alone can do by virtue of her calling. Others will benefit and grow from experience, and as we delegate to others, may we communicate well—explain the assignment in simple, understandable language. Then, check understanding carefully. Having the sister repeat back her own understanding of the instruction, to my mind, is the best way. Sprinkle in a generous portion of your own enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is contagious. Follow up in a kindly, helpful way from time to time, just to make certain that all is on course. Finally, let your crowning effort be a sincere word of commendation. That way the door will always be open for tomorrow. Many times we feel that an unwilling worker should be released without hesitation. I like President Tanner's advice on the subject. He says if you have workers who will not respond, there is no question about it, fire them—fire them with enthusiasm! Do it again and again. After you have done this kind of firing a few dozen times and still no results, then maybe you can think in some other terms. A little act of kindness, a little tact, is so important as we involve others. Brother Dunn tells the story about a good sister who was shopping for a pair of shoes. She entered the first store, was fitted, and complained about one shoe being too snug. She was told by the clerk that one of her feet was larger than the other, and she left in a huff. At the next store, a much wiser clerk observed that one foot was smaller than the other. She immediately made the purchase.

Now, one final comment from a bishop: "I can always be certain that recommendations and decisions made by our Relief Society president are influenced by the spirit of the Lord." The Lord has said, "If ye love me, keep my commandments." As you partake of the sacrament each week, you renew your covenant to keep his commandments, that his spirit may be with you always. Then, sisters, it is just as simple as that. As you abide by his commandments, you become available to the gifts of the spirit in your callings. In effect you "put on the whole armour of God." (Ephesians 6:11.) A decision that is modulated with the Spirit of the Lord is essential to the success of this great latter-day work. Simplify your lives. May we always remember that the Lord's house is a house of order, and that is the way yours should be. Unless your own home is in order, it is unlikely that your Church assignment will be. Paul gave advice to the bishops in the meridian of time, and I am convinced that this reasoning would also be true for all who hold the office of presidency in Relief Society. He described the able bishop as "One that ruleth his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity." Then Paul asks, "For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of 169 March 1968 the Church of God?" (I Timothy 3:4-5.) May we not consider an able Relief Society president, in like manner, as one who manages well her own house, having her children under control with sincerity; for if a sister knows not how to manage her own household, how shall she take care of her important Church assignment? My wonderful, dear sisters of this great Relief Society, mothers in Zion, defenders of the faith, may I invite you to listen closely to one additional thought, and as you listen, may you rededicate yourselves as Latter-day Saint women. For as Paul puts it, "as the elect of God," and this you surely are, then, showing forth as Paul urges: mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts... and be ye thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another... singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him. (Colossians 3:12-17.) Sisters, the air is literally charged with anticipation and urgency for this particular General Conference. All of this because the Church is growing, stretching. There has never been a time when so much needed to be done. It is your good fortune to be blessed to live in this most exciting time and to find yourselves locked arm in arm with 170 the priesthood in the front ranks of the most vital and urgent cause known to men. Never before has time been shorter. Never before have the ranks of leadership been more capable, but lest we forget, never before has the Adversary been so clever, never has he been so cunning in his attempts to thwart our success. How grateful we should all be for that blessed event of March 17, 1842, when the Prophet Joseph Smith organized the Relief Society "after a pattern of the priesthood." Then, to continue in his own words, "as an aid to the priesthood," to function "under the direction and guidance of the _ priesthood." There is nothing more glorious in this world than a cooperative and loving, capable woman standing faithfully at the side of her busy, dedicated husband, both anxiously engaged in teaching their children in truth and light, both finding time to be of service in the kingdom, both cheerfully obedient to their priesthood authority. Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord. For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God. (1 Corinthians 11:11-12.) I bear testimony that only as the priesthood-bearing man, and the priesthood-honoring woman supplement one another in a common, dedicated, righteous endeavor, can the ultimate purposes of heaven be achieved. May God so inspire us, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

KNOWLEDGE OF GREATEST WORTH [Address Delivered at the General Session of the Relief Society Annual General Conference, September 27, 1967]...

For out of the books which shall be written I will judge the world, every man according to their works, according to that which is written (2 Nephi, 29:11.) These are the words of the Lord, as told by the prophet Nephi, and the books referred to are the recorded words of God to his children. The Lord further says, "because that I have spoken one word ye need not suppose that I cannot speak another... Because that ye have a Bible ye need not suppose that it contains all my words that I have not caused more to be written. (2 Nephi, 29:9-10.)" The Lord made it clear that he would speak to the Jews, to the Nephites, and to others of his children. He says, "my word also shall be gathered in one" (2 Nephi, 29:14.) We, as Latter-day Saints, have the great blessing to possess not only the Bible but The Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. These are our only holy scriptures—the word of the Lord "gathered in one." These records were preserved by the Lord that they may come to us in his own due time and in his own unusual ways. They contain the knowledge of greatest worth, which points the way back to his presence. These are the books from which the Lord said, "I will judge the world." It would seem, then, of great value to us to read the words of these books. In fact, we have been given the commandment to study them diligently, "Search the scriptures." (John 5:39.) The Bible was said by one renowned scholar to be "the most exciting book in the world." It has had a more profound influence for good upon mankind than any other book. Much of the world's greatest art, music, and literature is inspired by the Bible. Little wonder that it is called the "Book of Books." In the Bible is found the story of the creation as told by the great Creator himself, "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth" (Gen. 1:1), and again, "God created man in his own image." (Gen. 1:27.) These are among the greatest declarations of all time.

Instructions of infinite worth to the whole world come to us in the Decalogue or the Ten Commandments—the great code of ethics written at Sinai by the finger of God. Should the people of the world abide by these rules of conduct, all of the troubles of the world would be solved. The message of the Old Testament is that God is the great Creator of the earth and Father of all people, and that his Son Jesus the Christ, the Redeemer, would some day come and live among men.

Knowledge of Greatest Worth
In the meridian of time the birth of the Savior was announced. This is the greatest story ever told, and one which everyone should become acquainted with in earliest childhood—to be followed by the account of his exemplary life and sublime teachings. If we had but one simple teaching, "Do unto others as ye would that they should do unto you," and lived it, all of the ills of this troubled world would melt away and love would abound instead of hatred.

The account of the Savior's death and resurrection brings to the world its greatest hope. The Prophet Joseph Smith said that the Bible means good and the Book of Mormon means more good. (Smith, Joseph Fielding, Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, Salt Lake City, Deseret News Press, page 300.) With the coming forth of this book, other knowledge of worth comes to us. Here is a "marvelous work and a wonder" and ",. As your Lord and your God liveth it is true." (D&C 17:6). Its greatest message is to the "convincing of the Jew and Gentile that JESUS is the CHRIST, the ETERNAL GOD, manifesting himself unto all nations." (Book of Mormon, title page). What more needed knowledge could come to a doubting and apostate generation?

The Doctrine and Covenants was given especially to this, the last dispensation. It comes as a voice of warning and cry for repentance. What could be more vital as teaching and application in our world than the Word of Wisdom? 173 March 1968

The Lord knew there would be "evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days." (D&C Section 89:4.) The most glorious of all revelations comes as Section 76 of the Doctrine and Covenants. The testimony is given that the Son lives "For we saw him, even on the right hand of God." (D&C 76:23.) In this section is also outlined the future status of all the inhabitants of the earth—whether telestial, terrestrial, or celestial, according to worthiness. Where will we find our place?

To every Relief Society sister and to every woman, I would urge the study of these scriptures in the homes. God has given no gifts greater than these. We owe it to ourselves and to our children to have a good knowledge of God's words to us. These books should be easily accessible in every home. Each child when old enough, should have his own copy of the books. They should be studied together as a family and become an important part of our own and our children's lives. Our eternal salvation depends upon our knowledge of and adherence to the words of these books.

Let us not be like Patrick Henry, who on his deathbed, said of the Bible, "Here is a book worth more than all others ever printed; yet it is my misfortune never to have found time to read it. It is now too late. I trust in the mercy of God." May we drink deeply of this "well of living water." (D&C 63:23.)

Marilyn McMeen Miller
Gem in blue, Sprig of heaven:
Apples have lost their blossoms in your face,
You touch your lips with fingers, delicate as lace.
Bud, opening spring;
With your small cry
A flock of sparrows sing
And it is winter yet.
I have not time enough to watch you
Ere the summer set—
Be slow to blossom, flowerlet.

Third Prize Story
Sarah Brown Neilson

With after-shave lotion, and dressing in their best,
Tony's smile always assured her the money had been well spent,
and that seemed to open doors wherever he went.
It was thinking of his smile that made the lump start swelling in Jane's throat again. She had swallowed it back so many times that day. After all, Tony was only sixteen and one had to make allowances for him. The world of teenagers was something different and apart from the rest of the world. Who had said only last week that you couldn't rear teenagers and have any emotions? Somehow she had to eliminate hers and justify his attitude about the football game. It was important to see things from his viewpoint and understand how he felt.

She managed to blink back the near-surface tears and glance at the clock. Three-thirty! School was over, and the game would be starting!

A game that had been such a highlight to all of them—until yesterday.
It seemed unreal that an event projected to such importance could shrivel to a mere fragment so quickly.

How had it happened?
Once again Jane's mind churned the events that had created the situation. It began with Frank's early arrival from work last Friday afternoon. She was expecting him, but managed to act surprised.
"Frank! What in the world are you doing home this time of day?"
Speaking slowly to hide his excitement, he explained,
"Well, there wasn't much doing at the office this afternoon and I thought
you might like to drop by the high school to see how Tony's football game is coming."

Jane smiled at his nonchalance, knowing his crowded schedule at work and the effort involved in getting away. He would never outgrow his love of sports nor his eager anticipation of the competition involved. He relived his own athletic days in every game Tony played. And justly so, when one considered how much of himself had been poured into that boy.

Their backyard had been a working ground for baseball and football as long as she could remember.
Frank's yearning for a smooth green lawn, sturdy shrubs, and healthy flowers had been replaced years ago by a boy's sturdy limbs and healthy attitudes. The worn spots in the lawn, the sparse shrubs thinned by swift balls, and the trampled flowers seemed a tribute to Frank's love and patience.

His knowledge of sports made him a qualified instructor and ready extra for any game.
He should have been a coach, Jane thought one day as she passed an open window and heard his convincing words on the values of honesty and fair play. How blessed she was to have him!

"T'd love to see Tony's game," Jane had called as she rushed to get ready,
knowing his disappointment if they missed one minute.
Of course, they would get Johnny from school on the way.

Living the game with Tony had been thrilling.

They were SO proud of his important position on the team and the way he came through in the last quarter. His courage and determination were magnificent as he struggled free of arms, legs, and tackles to make a mad dash for the goal line. The touchdown gave their school a one point advantage which meant playing in the league championship game. Jane realized now—too late—that they had been carried away by the excitement of it all. Frank yelled too many instructions, she cheered too enthusiastically, and ten-year-old Johnny created an embarrassing situation. Why didn't she stop him from dashing out on the field to hug his brother when the gun sounded? She had been afraid they were wrong when she saw Tony trying to move quickly off the field to avoid him. But no such luck! Johnny was fast and persistent, like his brother. (Frank had taught them well!) He was shouting congratulations and patting Tony on the back long before he could rescue himself. Tony's response to their generous praise at dinner that night seemed a little cool. He didn't show the usual interest as Frank verbally relived each play and dramatized his touchdown. During the week he was unusually quiet, and his lack of enthusiasm about the coming championship game worried her. It was odd Frank didn't notice. His own excitement and anticipation must have clouded his awareness. If only Tony would talk to her. They had always communicated—especially when problems were concerned. She thought of approaching him, but realized the first move must be his. Yesterday it had finally come. Jane was peeling potatoes for dinner when Tony came home from football practice—that made it easier because he didn't have to face her. What he wanted to say was difficult. She could tell because he kept making small talk and fidgeting. The telephone rang and he seemed to welcome the reprieve. When he had taken the message for Frank and hung up the receiver, he cleared his throat, took courage, and came right to the point.

"Mom, would you—and Dad—care if I asked you not to come to the game tomorrow?" His voice sounded hollow and strained. Not go to the game! Could she have heard him right? This, the most important game of the whole season! Jane groped for an answer, but found a question was the best she could do.

"Don't you want us to be there, Tony?"

The kitchen chair squeaked as he shifted awkwardly trying to come up with an answer. "Well, it's just that—oh—not many parents come—and I kind of feel like the fair-haired boy. Mom, do you know what I mean—all the yelling—Johnny hugging me—and all the fuss?" Jane could see Frank's eager face as he had talked about the game at breakfast. How could she tell him? Tony had always used her as a reporter of bad news and difficult situations.

"You can say it better and soften the blow for Dad," he would explain. But this was too much!

And Johnny, who visualized his brother as an inspired hero, how could he understand? The potatoes were going down fast as her peeling speed had increased. Her face was flushed, and her throat felt dry as she struggled for composure.

"Yes, Tony, I do know what you mean, and we'll spare you the embarrassment. Now, go and rest before dinner. You'll need all the energy you can get for the game tomorrow."

Tony looked relieved as he moved toward his bedroom. "Thanks, Mom, you're great!" Jane couldn't let him know how she felt—how Frank would feel. After all, their pride was at stake. This was no time for emotion and they must look at things sensibly. Tony's friends were important, as was his standing in the group. Interested parents threatened his security; that was clear. It wasn't Tony's fault—he was the victim of the day and age. She hoped Frank would see this, and realize it was only a game. Why should it take on such importance? But in her heart, Jane knew it was more than a game. It was all the games that would follow—all the activities that would be part of his life. It was a test of his moral courage, of his ability to apply their teachings, of his regard for their giving, loving, and sharing. Tony had always been so special. He must never know how he had let them down.

Like the psychologists taught, something of this sort could damage his self-respect. Jane welcomed Frank home from work with an air of forced gaiety. Some real softening was going to be required for this blow. And she must tell him immediately before the last minute instructions to Tony about the game started. She had sorted through her "softening approaches" and decided the jovial method was best.

"You'll never believe how funny Tony was today," she said, when Frank was comfortable in his relaxing chair. "He wanted to tell us not to come to his game tomorrow, because all the attention embarrasses him, and he had such a hard time wording it right—so he wouldn't hurt our feelings."

The silence was awful. Why didn't Frank say something? Maybe he didn't trust his voice. Jane tried a little harder.

"Tony assured us our being there wasn't that important and that he can tell us all the details when he gets home. It was a riot to see how relieved he was."

The first shock was over, and Frank joined in the pretense.

"That is hilarious! Course, we could go to the game with a paper sack over our heads and tiny holes for the eyes, so no one would recognize us! There's so much to do at the office, I doubt I could arrange to go, anyway. Is dinner almost ready? I'm starved."

For being starved, Frank took rather meager helpings. He was too cheerful and avoided talking about the game. Tony was his old self and even played a question game with Johnny before going to bed. Jane found sleep difficult and lay staring into the dark long after the house was quiet.

She could tell by Frank's breathing that he, too, was awake. How her heart ached for his unspoken disappointment that could never be discussed. She reached for his hand, hoping he would sense the love and understanding she couldn't express.

Everyone did the usual things next morning. Frank's face showed weariness and his shoulders drooped a little, but he patiently called the boys three times, took his exercises, and gave Tony first chance at the shower. Tony shined his shoes, brushed his hair and splashed on lotion—apparently it was a white shirt day. Johnny came out with dragging shoe laces and sleep-swollen eyes just in time for family prayer.

As Frank asked the Lord's blessings upon them, he expressed gratitude for their wonderful sons and made a special plea for Tony's safety and success in the championship game. Jane was glad the bacon needed turning as he finished, so the moisture around her eyes would go unnoticed.

Like many other mornings, Tony was too late to walk and Frank rushed through his breakfast to be chauffeur. "Mom, what time are you picking me up for the game?" Johnny asked as she dug in her purse for lunch money. "We won't be going today, Johnny," Dad has too much work at the office. Please try to understand." "Not go to the game! Mom, you're kidding! Tony can't play if Dad isn't there—he's always there. We have to go to the game! It's an important one. Tony'll never forgive us!" 179 March 1968 Jane bit her lip until it hurt. "Johnny, you're almost late, now please hurry. Just forget about the game for today." A dark look of confusion clouded Johnny's face. "But, Mom, we have to go—I'll be looking for you because I know Dad will come—he always comes—he wouldn't do that to Tony!" Jane hugged him almost too tight as he went out the door. His faith in Frank was heartwarming and she loved him for it. If only she could explain—but no—not to a ten-year-old. "The huge basket of ironing looked almost inviting as Jane appraised her day's work. There was something about ironing that gave her a settled feeling. It was never a question of what came next. She knew what came next for a solid chunk of hours. She could sit in one place, enjoy a feeling of accomplishment, and do some thinking. But thinking today had only brought confusion and more heartache. As the mound of unironed clothes grew small and the pile of finished ones grew large, the battle to justify Tony's behavior within herself continued. A slamming door shattered her thoughts and announced Johnny's arrival from school. He was breathless and beads of perspiration marked his forehead. "Mom, you didn't come and the game has already started! I ran all the way from the bus stop! Can't we go without Dad? Please? Tony will be looking for us. We have to go!" Jane looked into his anxious, freckled face and tried to sound convincing. "It's too late, dear," she said, 180 and Tony will have fun telling us all about the game at dinner. He's never had a chance to do that because we've always been there. We won't even know who won and he can surprise us! Why don't you get washed and we'll make Tony's favorite cake for dinner. You can make the frosting!" It was a poor substitute for the game, but with Johnny's interest in running the electric mixer, Jane's loving persuasion won. Even with all the family favorites, Jane knew 180 dinner would be difficult. Tony would try to tell them about the game, but without Frank's comments on every detail it would fall flat. Johnny's innocent remarks would create embarrassment, and she could already feel the strain of trying to pretend everything was fine. Frank arrived before Tony, sniffing the air and exclaiming about the joy of coming home to smells of cinnamon and brown sugar. "What a lucky boy you are to have a mother who makes such a wonderful home for us, Johnny," she said. Look at the fresh ironed shirts and stack of clean clothes. Do you think she knows we love and appreciate her?" After twenty years of sharing sorrows and problems with Frank, Jane knew this was his way of trying to help her over the disappointment in Tony. How like him to care what she thought and felt. The game wasn't mentioned until they were sitting down to dinner and Tony opened the door. His flushed face and dark hair, still damp from the shower, made him painfully handsome. "Who won! Who won! Did you make a touchdown? Did you win?" Johnny shouted as he grabbed Tony around the waist. There was a long silence, and then Tony led Johnny to the table and sat down beside him. In a very quiet voice, he said, "Yes, Johnny, we won. The score was eighteen to twelve, but I lost! Oh, I made a touchdown all right—but I still lost. I realized what I had lost when the game started, and I didn't hear Dad's voice in the crowd—when I looked up and didn't see Mom's hand waving or you standing on More Than a Game the bench. Somehow, nothing else mattered but your being there—not the game, my friends, or winning. Oh, I kept playing and doing my best—Dad has taught me to do that automatically—but I realized I had sold you down the river for twisted pride and stupid values. Suddenly, I felt sorry for all the guys whose parents don't care about the games—who are too busy to come. All I wanted to do was come home and be with you." Johnny looked confused. "I told you Tony would be mad if we didn't go, Mom. You should have come home, Dad!" Tony smiled. How like them to protect his standing with Johnny. "Mom—Dad—I'm sorry—can you ever forgive me? Please don't miss another game!" Jane looked into the faces that surrounded the table. Yes, it was more than a game. It was the height of realization, the warmth of understanding, and the cementing of family ties. Now, at last, the tears were spilling unchecked down her face—tears of joy! Through the mist she looked across the table and wondered if there could ever be anything more beautiful than the sight of a father hugging his teen-age son. Sarah Brown Neilson, Pasadena, California, expresses appreciation for the short story contest: "The Relief Society short story contest has opened a new horizon for me. 'More Than a Game' is my first attempt at writing, other than a short incident that was published making me eligible for the contest. I have always loved writing letters and often wondered if writing might be a hobby I could develop and enjoy. This opportunity has helped me to find it is. | graduated with an English major from the Utah State University in Logan, and have had varied Church experience, holding seventeen different positions in the last twenty-five years. Currently, | am First Counselor in the Pasadena Stake Relief Society Presidency, and my husband, Keith, who has been a bishop, now serves on the High Council. We enjoy three wonderful children: Nancy, living in the San Francisco area while her husband, David Waldvogel, attends dental school; Bob, serving on a mission in England; and David, attending Pasadena High School." 181 How Relief Society Came to Me Rexine Eagar Three or four days ago Bishop Thomas called my home and asked that I come to his office. When I told my family that I was leaving for a few minutes, and where I was going, my ten-year-old daughter started bubbling over with "Oh, goodie, we don't have our Primary teacher yet. I'll bet it will be you." As I straightened my hair, she bubbled continuously about the joys and hardships of teaching the members of her class.

When I returned home and told her that I would be teaching in Relief Society, her face fell and she said, "That's not fair; the ladies already know everything." I have a testimony of the value and worth of Relief Society, but I didn't always have it. Let me tell you how I was converted.

I was married when I was eighteen years old and had opportunity then to attend Relief Society—but I didn't. I thought it must be worthwhile because it was part of the Church organization, and I had a testimony of the gospel then, but at eighteen, I was afraid to go for two reasons. First, I thought the meetings were held only to work on welfare sewing, and I knew I wasn't skilled in sewing and quilting. Secondly, I thought that the social relationship among the sisters was talking while they worked. At eighteen, I felt I wasn't wise enough and didn't know enough about what was going on in our small town to be a part of the conversation.

As the years passed, I felt less and less a desire to attend. As long as I can remember, I have had two main goals in life: successfully to rear and teach a large family of children, and to get as much education as I can. During the first six years of our marriage we were blessed with five children, and I was thrilled with them, but began to feel frustrated and unhappy with myself because I was doing nothing about continuing my education. I couldn't manage to attend night classes and I felt bitter and enslaved by my housework.

During that time, my Relief Society teachers came each month and always invited me to attend meetings. Inside myself, I felt, "That's all I need now, to be using my time in Relief Society meetings." Then, one day the president came to see me and asked me to sing in a meeting. I went to Relief Society and opened the door to opportunities I didn't know existed. At that meeting, the class leader and lesson inspired me, and I knew that there was my way to gain knowledge.

I subscribed to The Relief Society Magazine and began to study before going to hear each lesson. I was thrilled with what I was learning. At first, I was attending for selfish reasons, because of what I could gain personally, but soon I began to see that I was learning things that were helping me to be a better wife and mother. I learned about helping my children eventually to reach maturity in all phases of their lives, not just physically. I could see how very much more was expected of me as a mother than I had realized before.

Sometimes I would become apprehensive—what if I hadn't become aware of these things? And so my desire to learn became accelerated, to learn to benefit my family. Four years ago, I was called to work as a member of the presidency in our ward. My desire to serve others outside my family group broadened the desire for knowledge and brought the joy of service.

I have heard several times that if a woman will faithfully attend her meetings, study the lessons, and try hard to make their teachings a part of her life, she will be gaining the equivalent of a college education. She will understand her calling in womanhood and motherhood and will have the knowledge and wisdom to succeed in both. I believe every Latter-day Saint woman should attend Relief Society, and in so doing, "the hand that rocks the cradle" will be strengthened, more gently and always unfalteringly.

This is my sincere belief and testimony.

THE UNNAMED SONG
Linnie Fisher Robinson

She recalls her aversion to practice,
The music room light and cool:
Yet the low notes came singing
Singing down deep in her soul.

The picture comes back like an etching
Of that long lost childhood day;
Her father and mother so patient
As she practiced her hour away.

The melodies are forgotten,
And the notes she tried to prolong;
But all of them sang to her young heart
A beautiful unnamed song

That sings through the varied hours of day
With faith that is sweet and strong;
Her rampart of beauty, concord, and love,
That will last until life is done.

A SUMMER'S DAY
Ruth Nicholson Pepper Corrimal East, New South Wales, Australia

The day she had had misgivings about had arrived. As the morning sun slatted through the Venetian blinds into the bedroom, Catherine knew that the weather would be no excuse for not going. All week, ever since Jim had suggested it and persuaded her to go, she had been reluctant. Blackberry picking! How idyllic it sounded, she thought wryly. Only it should be called "Mosquito Swatting" or "Snake Dodging" or "Fly Flicking!" Ugh! She shuddered inwardly, thinking of the ordeal ahead.

I'm an outdoor girl, Catherine mused grimly. But Jim had been insistent and she herself was tired of being left at home with baby David, always making the excuse that he was too small to take on the outings on which Jim liked to take the other two children. But why had it been blackberrying she had said yes to? It would have been more pleasant to have gone to the beach or into the bush for a barbecue. Or even—mad, crazy thought that it was—to have gone to Sydney for the day without the children, for shopping and a show.

They kept talking about it, but somehow there was never enough money or time to spare. It was blackberry time, though, and their Relief Society president had especially asked all who could to gather the blackberries for jam-making for their fete. "Good idea," Jim had said, when she had casually mentioned it. "How about coming with us next Saturday, Cath—your mother would be glad to have David for a few hours?" And so she had been persuaded and it was now upon her.

Oh, well, she thought, not without humor, I guess I'll live through it.

Their departure was one and a half hours later than planned. Saturday morning was a morning that never liked to be hurried at their home, and today had been no exception. They had all lingered and talked over breakfast, and then Catherine had washed through the nappies while Jim and the boys washed the dishes and packed some fruit and cake for their picnic lunch.

In dismay, Catherine glanced back at the rooms just before they locked the door behind them—dust on the furniture, toys scattered, ironing in the basket—and it was Sunday tomorrow. Her heart sank. Saturday was usually her day to get ready for the Sabbath, and she revelled in her tidy home and well-stocked shelves on Saturday night. She wouldn't be doing much revelling tonight, she thought ruefully.

As they sped along the coast road to her mother's home on the other side of town, Catherine began to relax a little, settling back in her seat with David on her knee, listening to Mike's and Stevie's excited chatter in the back, and to Jim humming contentedly to himself as he drove their old car. It was a glorious January day, the hot Australian sun sparkled down on the golden beaches, and the sapphire blue sea was fringed deeply with rows of stark white rolling surf. The South Pacific, she thought idly—this same romantic ocean lapped the shores of Tahiti, too. Wonder if they worried about unmade beds and mud on the back verandah there? It was going on ten o'clock before they left Catherine's mother's, uniting adoring grandmother with adoring grandson, and, after buying ice cones for them all at the corner shop, they left the main highway and followed the winding road up the mountainside. "Look, Mom—look at those big ones—there!" Stevie pointed excitedly out of the window to the blackberry bushes along the roadside, while three-year-old Mike's eyes popped silently, unable to speak for the ice cone at his mouth. "They are better further up though," Jim told them all, "but we'll try to work down to those later." Halfway up the mountain, they all jumped out of the car and began to pull on their long rubber boots, distribute billy cans, and Catherine embalmed herself with mosquito repellent. A few minutes later, questionably perfumed and oily faced, she found herself scrambling under the barbed wire with her two sons, while Jim held it up for them. Gingerly, they followed Jim through the waist-high grass, dry and prickly with the prolonged heat, and she hoped the snakes could hear them coming. Seven-year-old Stevie shared his thoughts. "Hope there're no snakes," he said, half to himself, and she could tell he was as nervous as she was. They reached the first bushes and picking began, but it was soon apparent that all the best berries were right in the middle of the clump, out of reach. "Stamp the outside branches down," Jim instructed from the other side of the bush, "and get right in the middle." Catherine's mind flashed back to a newspaper article she had read only that week. "Blackberry bushes are definitely a menace to the whole south coast, harboring rabbits and snakes." She saw Stevie hanging back doubtfully as she did as Jim had directed, and began picking the inner, juicier blackberries. "Come on, Stevie—in here." "I'm scared, Mom," he said. "There's snakes in there." She looked at him in sympathy. "Yes—perhaps. But shall I tell you something?" She smiled at him as she remembered. "This morning when I got out of bed, I asked our Heavenly Father to take care of us all this day." As they looked at each other, she saw he was reassured, and he followed her to help pick the berries. She suddenly felt lighter in her own heart, too. Somehow, by sharing her prayer with another who had been afraid, she had strengthened her own faith in Heavenly Father's protection. "It's good to know Heavenly Father watches over us, isn't it, Mom?" Stevie said, as he crouched beside her, pulling off the lower berries. "Yes, Stevie, it is." As the morning wore on they gradually worked their way down the hillside, the sun growing hotter and hotter, and the rich scent of the berries almost overpowering in its sweetness. For a moment, Catherine paused to look at the loveliness of the land—the blue hazed hills flanking the long green valley with its gray-green gum trees, and the glittering sea, in front of her. What a good country it was to live in, she thought, and she wondered then if her great-grandfather, who had come in chains to Australia, had seen the beauty of this sun-drenched land, or if it had always been a prison to him as he remembered the softness of his native, faraway England. CS: She was glad she had come. Glad that she had left the housework for a day to enjoy the beauty of her country. Suddenly, too, she realized that her fear of snakes and insect bites was nothing more than an excuse for staying home to cook, clean, and wash—her neat, conscientious mind running every day deeper into the groove that she was wearing away for herself. How good it was to jump out of the groove once in awhile, she thought, with a smile, and she grinned happily at young Mike with his purple-stained face. Later, they stopped briefly for a quick lunch, calling to Mike and Stevie who had been distracted from the blackberries by a trickle of a stream with tadpoles. As they slaked their thirst with apples and oranges they laughed as they compared their scratches, Catherine ruefully surveying her legs and arms torn from top to bottom in spite of her boots, and her purple, thorn-pricked hands. "My beauty's ruined," she chuckled and she caught the look in her husband's eye. "It's been good having you with us, Cath," he said quietly, "I miss you when you don't come." "Yes, Jim—I should try to get out more with you—I've enjoyed it so much this morning—just being with you and the boys. I hate being left at home when you go off—and yet it always seems so much effort to 'A Summer's Day' get ready and come—always so much to be done at home." He nodded. "I know, love," he answered. "I wish I could make things easier for you." "You help me enough, Jim," she said. "I wouldn't want you to do more. No—I've thought about it a lot—until the children grow up a bit its going to be hard—partly I guess because of my nature that must have everything just so. But I'm going to come out more with you, Jim. Make me come, as you did today, it's been like a vacation." "I'm going to thank Heavenly Father tonight for keeping away the snakes," Stevie said suddenly, as he thoughtfully chewed on his apple. Catherine smiled at him. "And I'm going to thank him for such a wonderful day with such a wonderful family." And she leaned over and kissed her husband.

CEDARS

Annie C. Esplin

Ageless, the cedars keep a trust with man,
Sending deep roots into the valley floor;
Redoubtable in drouth and strong wild winds—
Yet, standing fragrant by a cottage door.

Green on the mountains, green on the plain,
Against rose-brown peaks and rose terrain.
Shelter for the pastures, grace for the street,
The cedars hold the seasons at their feet.

Immune to common parasites, they know
The mischief of the clinging mistletoe.
They sing a quiet song in spare, spare land—
Recompense of green to stone and sand.

VOLUME 55 MARCH 1968 NUMBER 3

General Board — Belle S. Spafford, President @ Marianne C. Sharp, First Counselor m Louise W. Madsen, Second Counselor w Evon W.

Peterson, Secretary-Treasurer

Daniel went into his house; and his windows being open toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God.... (Daniel 6:10.) The scriptures record the history of Daniel, who was "of the king's seed, and of the princes." He was taken a captive into the land of Babylon and given a Chaldean name and was schooled in the learning of an alien land, where he became a powerful counselor to Nebuchadnezzar and Darius the Great. Yet Daniel kept his window open toward Jerusalem, and he remembered his heritage.

In the year's beginning, or the day's beginning, or the beginning of a season of our lives, or on the Anniversary of Relief Society, let us keep the windows open—not only the casement windows of our homes, but the windows of our spiritual dwelling, for an open window, Anna B. Hart Edith S. Elliott Florence J. Madsen Leone G. Layton Blanche B. Stoddard Aleine M. Young Alberta H. Christensen Mildred B. Eyring Edith P. Backman Winniefred S. Manwaring Elna P. Haymond Mary R.

Aldous wherever it may be, directs our thoughts outward, and beckons us to concerns and considerations beyond our immediate problems and our personal desires. By looking through an open window, it may be possible for us to learn wisdom and to become more fully aware of our possibilities and our ultimate destiny. Perhaps we can look upon the eternal design and see therein a pattern for ourselves in relationship to our families, our friends, our responsibilities, and a direction for our prayers. It may be that our own open windows may be lighted and luminous—a beckoning to the pathway someone else may be seeking. A lamp which a pioneer mother lighted and placed in a window became a light unto many who were looking for illumination. The woman polished the glass chimney of her lamp; she trimmed the wick; and filled the receptacle with oil. Then she set the lamp in the window which faced the road and the highway. The woman's daughter remarked that the lamp was not placed for the most advantageous reading position, but the mother said, "Move your chair a little, my dear. We do not light a lamp for ourselves alone, but also for the benefit of travelers, who, with us, are bound for the same destination, and all of us need a directing light."

A counselor to a Relief Society president in a large rural ward, on a visit to the president, noted that the window of her little study was open to a view of the majestic rim of mountains to the east. She noticed, also, that the carpet in front of the window was worn. The president smiled as the two Relief Society workers stood together before the window. "Here I sit to make plans for the organization," the president said, "here I kneel in prayer; here I look out upon the radiant world, and the world looks back at me—and our relationship is thus established. Through the window, and by its significance, I am inspired, reminded to look outward and upward into the spiritual summation of my days."

All the days of our lives, and particularly a time of seasonal change, may be the time for a personal inventory of our outward and inward looking propensities and habits. In a time of challenge, in the days of a crisis in our lives, in the interim of adjustment to new experiences and new responsibilities, may we consider well the direction of our thoughts. Are we looking through a window outward at the breadth and beauty of our opportunities, or is the view restricted to ourselves—our personal wants, our selfish needs? Always, the outer view is more far-reaching in its range, more lofty in its skyward peaks. Although our own capabilities, our own accomplishments may not be entirely in harmony with our ideals, still the view from the window can expand our souls, and, perhaps, as Daniel looked toward Jerusalem, his heritage and his home, we can look outward and upward through a window that reveals the expanse of mountains and of morning.

Ype 189 RED CROSS MEETS CHALLENGES

One of the major challenges the American Red Cross faces today is in Vietnam, where a tough and demanding conflict calls for new approaches to the continuing problems of serving the United States armed forces in the field. In 1965, twenty-five Red Cross staff members served in South Vietnam. Today, more than 300 serve the nearly half million American troops stationed there. Almost 200 of the American Red Cross workers on assignment in South Vietnam provide personalized welfare and morale-building services for able-bodied men and programs of recreation for men in hospitals and aboard the hospital ships "Repose" and "Sanctuary." Another 100, all young women trained in recreation center-club-mobile unit operation, present audience participation programs that bring wholesome moments of relaxation to servicemen. Welfare services to Americans in uniform in South Vietnam, as in other parts of the world, include counseling in personal and family problems, emergency communications, and emergency financial assistance. Red Cross workers in hometown chapters obtain confidential information for the benefit of servicemen about personal and family emergencies relating to requests for leave, compassionate reassignment, and hardship discharges. They transmit messages about family health, births, and deaths at a rate of more than 650 daily to keep a line of communication open between home and South Vietnam. Each month, approximately 20,000 servicemen in Vietnam receive some type of assistance through the Red Cross.

The American Red Cross is governed nationally and locally by volunteers. Most of the organization's duties are performed by volunteers. Red Cross volunteers in the United States serve in nursing homes, veterans hospitals, and schools for the mentally retarded, in motor pools, and in social welfare programs. Having someone to read or write a letter for him becomes something very special to a lonely disabled veteran. The help of a volunteer driver can make all the difference to an older person who otherwise could not keep a doctor's appointment. The Red Cross is financed entirely by voluntary contributions. As a voluntary organization, the Red Cross depends on the American people for support—both in volunteer time and in money. To keep Red Cross service at the high level which both the fighting man in Vietnam and his family at home have appreciated, and have come to expect, the need for continued support is critical this year.

Cannon Women who are succeeding in helping to solve the problem of the acute shortage of nurses, are the twenty-eight "mature" women who recently received their diplomas from the Quo Vadis School of Nursing in Toronto, Canada, the only nursing school in the world designed for mature women. The twenty-eight women are all between the ages of thirty-two and fifty-two, and will be followed in graduation by many other women of similar ages who are now in training at Quo Vadis. Many United States and Canadian hospitals are studying ways to set up special facilities for training older women to become nurses, for, as the directors of Quo Vadis believe, "some skills and insights come only from living."

Denise Jensen (Mrs. Joseph Rivera), soprano, student at the Manhattan School of Music, and pupil of Sarkus Sakarian, in November was presented at a recital sponsored by the Latter-day Saints Arts and Artists Series of the Manhattan Ward, New York City. She was accompanied by Irene Weiss, a gifted young LDS musician. Winnifred Bowers, New York editor, and former member of the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association General Board, serves as director of the series.

Mrs. Winifred Ewing, thirty-eight, lawyer, mother of three children, was recently elected to the British Parliament, the first member of the Scottish National Party to go to Parliament since 1945. She is representative of Scotland's emerging leaders who encourage new types of industry and a wider publicity for the great beauty of the country's green vales and craggy isles and inlets.

Farah, wife of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, was crowned Empress of Iran by her husband in Teheran, October 26, 1967, after he had crowned himself Emperor. The Shah, actual ruler for twenty-six years, waited to achieve certain reforms for his people before his coronation. Farah, first woman in Persian history to be crowned empress (or queen), was a commoner, studying architecture in Paris on a scholarship, before her marriage. In case of the Shah's death, she would rule Iran as regent until her son reached the age of twenty.

Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain, opening Parliament in November 1967, followed the requirements of the British monarchy in reading a speech written by the Prime Minister, in this case Harold Wilson. The speech called for limiting the hereditary membership of the House of Lords, a body of 861 lords, all of whom do not have hereditary titles.

Mary Sue Wilcox, a seventeen-year-old Latter-day Saint girl from Bountiful, Utah, honor student and cheerleader of her senior high school class, won the American championship title for roller skating in August in Lincoln, Nebraska. Competing later in Birmingham, England, for the world championship, she did not win but gave such a beautiful performance that Wide World of Sports photographed her entire exhibition for television. It was shown in America and in many other countries.

Jerrie Cobb, famous aviatrix, has long waged a battle to have women included among America's astronauts. She and two hundred others have been rejected—not because of their sex, says the committee, but because they do not quite fulfill the scientific demands.

It is the wish to use articles from many stakes in various areas of the Church, but distance, cost, and the availability of transportation have to be considered, and limit the selection.

Because the homemaking discussions for 1967-68 were based on the rooms of the home, it was decided to present major displays in room-designated areas. The purpose was not just to show rooms, but rather to display homemaking articles which appropriately would be found in each room. We chose to call this part of our display "Rooms for Improvement." There were six room divisions: living room, dining area, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, nursery, and patio.

In addition, other displays with interesting demonstrations were presented.

DISPLAY IN THE FOYER As one entered the beautiful Bonneville Stake House, where the display was held, one felt the spirit of Relief Society. The displays in the hall featured the 125th Anniversary of Relief Society. One's glance was drawn to the impressive seal over the cultural hall door, "Relief Society 1842-1967." On a large table, life-like sego lilies were attractively arranged around two wheels, denoting progress. Above this arrangement, white sea gulls were suspended. A spinning wheel, and a churn (which had been carefully carried across the plains, now attractively antiqued and hand-painted), graced the entrance hall. The pungent aroma of fresh sagebrush filled the air.

192 Transparencies by J M. Heslop Jean Rigby, Sugarhouse Stake Geneva Brown, Holladay Stake Sagebrush was placed with wheat to enhance the decorations. The blue of the sky on a clear day seemed transferred to the foyer by the use of blue fabric attractively arranged.

CHRISTMAS DISPLAY As you left the foyer, two choices were open to you, either to go into the cultural hall for an overall view of the displays, or to follow the beckoning lights into the lounge for the Christmas display. The Christmas display featured a tall, graceful Christmas tree in one corner near the fireplace, decorated with large multicolored balls and tiny lights circling the tree from trunk to top branch. An impressive star hung above the fireplace. This was flanked by three handmade Wise Men—beautifully and intricately made. Round tables were alternated against the wall with colonnades holding miniature Christmas trees, each individually and differently decorated. The tables were covered with green cloths of the same pattern—handmade articles of intriguing design graced them—suggestions for making in homemaking meetings, ideas to please the homemaker and beautify any home at Christmas time, including many toys and other articles to charm the children.

Mary Jennings, Bonneville Stake One exquisitely beautiful object which drew exclamations of pleasure from the throng was a large, oval, gold-leafed picture frame. This encased an elegant Christmas tree made entirely from old jewelry glued onto a velvet mounting.

A stunning and unusual dining table decorated in purple, blue, and green also caught the eye. The purple felt cloth was elegant, yet simple to make. Yarn tassels graced the corners; green balls, each housing a single light, centered the table in an attractive arrangement. A group seemed always to surround the table where burlap Christmas wreaths were being made.

HANDKERCHIEF TREE�ANTIQUED ARTICLES

Entering the cultural hall, gay and colorful flowers captured the interest—exquisite flowers created from pieces of paper. Rugs of many varieties hugged the east wall. Beautiful rugs made from old woolen clothing were a delight to behold. Children's rugs made in the shape of animals charmed everyone. No one could resist taking a few minutes to watch and learn the art of antiquing or handpainting small articles, such as an old churn, an antiquated iron skillet, and a rocking chair. Many articles long ago discarded have thus been reclaimed and made beautiful.

Many paused to admire the beautiful embroidered wall hanging made on fine burlap and embroidered in wool yarn. The design was not original. The idea for it came from a picture in a magazine. It was composed of flowers and birds in gay colors—a work of art, yet something which can be copied by anyone who has magic in her hands.

The gay sparkling lights of the handkerchief tree beckoned all to see the hankies with crocheted and lace edges.
195 MORMON HANDICRAFT EXHIBIT

The Mormon Handicraft display included exquisite handmade quilts, attractive, useful aprons, pillows, luncheon cloths, and afghans, with patterns and materials available to Relief Society organizations.

EASTER DISPLAY TABLE

One of the loveliest displays was the Easter table, each article appropriate for the season and especially designed to intrigue a child, and many of them suitable for a mother and her children to make together. Bunnies, chicks, Easter eggs, and a tray of colorfully decorated cookies centered the display.

Homemaking hobbies for family togetherness brought many new and interesting ideas, including how to use pine cones, and acorns, to make small Christmas trees, making use of available materials such as flowers and weeds.

ENCLOSURE CARDS

Many of the gifts were items that children would love to make with a little guidance from mother and daddy. New textile painting resembling embroidery work, and enclosure cards for all occasions, made from discarded and used cards, caught the interest of everyone. A simple process was illustrated, using small folded recipe cards decorated with motifs cut from cards and arranged to make a design.

POLYNESIAN DISPLAY

The highlight of this section was the Polynesian display—carried across the ocean in fourteen different suitcases. Assembled and displayed with artistic grace were bedspreads, wall hangings, purses, and jewelry of many kinds. The handiwork was colorful and intricate.

OOMS FOR IMPROVEMENT

All who attended the homemaking display "Rooms for Improvement" were delighted with the lovely home decorations, magnificent evidences of the ability of Relief Society women. Antiquing and gold leafing were predominant in the living-dining area. Old furniture, reclaimed and refinished to professional perfection, copies of beautiful paintings by the old masters, treated in a new manner, and decorative tablecloths caught the eye—a green velvet covering was enhanced by an exquisite low bowl, inexpensive, yet looking costly because of its gold leaf finish.

An attractive lamp, completely handmade from its gold-leaf base to its hand-sewn shade, was much admired. Some of the most exciting articles were beautiful candles—done in somber hues. They enhanced the beauty of a candle by skillfully placing a copy of a great painting about the candle and making it appear as a part of the candle by 197

Interesting to make and much less costly than purchased ones were wall plaques, table coverings, kitchen aprons, and tea towels of many varieties, which added greatly to the room's attractive decor. The bedroom combined new designs and furnishings with the old. The wardrobe was a gift to a bride some seventy-five years ago. The old brass bed was a family heirloom. The bench and night stand came from Deseret Industries and were refinished and antiqued a beautiful blue. The trunk, found in an attic, was gold-leafed, varnished, and lined with velvet—a bride's dream. The beautiful bedspread was a work of art, hand—

made by sisters of the stake. Quilted robes, gowns, and hangers were all handmade, a symphony in blue and green.

What can one do for bathroom decorations? Was the query. Results were amazing. Shower curtain, drapes, bowl cover, were all hand done and attractive. All details were perfect, from decorated soaps, waste baskets, and wall decorations, to the flower-bordered mirrors and guest towels. This picture also gives a glimpse of the beautiful decorations used to camouflage the basketball standards—net covered pampas grass, plus an ornate bushel basket, uniquely fashioned creations long to be remembered.

The nursery was a delight, all pink and white, and filled with priceless family relics. The little cradle was handmade. The chest belonged to a great-grandmother. It was refinished in white antiquing—a decorator's dream. Quilts and blankets made the bed and cradle inviting. Interesting animal wall plaques added charm to the room. Handmade blocks and Raggedy Ann dolls were ready for a child's eager hands. Dresses and sleepwear for the little ones made women want to try their hands at sewing for children. One child couldn't resist the inviting scene and was found lying in the cradle.

The patio area was so inviting that visitors were sorry summer had gone. The handpainted backdrop view depicted an ocean scene. Summer furniture and equipment enhanced the display. Aprons, pot holders, gloves, gay tablecloths, table decorations invited the sisters to join in outdoor living. The patio items were of particular interest because they suggested many articles that could well be made for a summer bazaar.

The centerpieces were made of bottles wrapped part way up with appropriate twine and used as candle holders—so easy to make, yet so attractive. Additional table lighting was provided by lamp holders made with cut tin cans forming a base with a glass chimney in the center.

A KEEPER OVERVIEW

As one left the cultural hall and turned for a last long look at the overview, one was almost overwhelmed by its loveliness.

The many tables decorated with ideas for social affairs, the fascinating displays by the Lamanite sisters, the beautiful pillows made from towels that looked like velvet, the lovely coordinated quilt display with robes, pillow cases, pillows; the apron tree; and the table of children's items, with a table centered by attractive jewelry displays, all gave one a feeling of pride in the women of the Church— their love of beauty, their great contribution in preparing hundreds of items for this homemaking display. Surely knowledge and intelligence, energy, skills, talents, and a desire for service have been given in abundance to the sisters of Relief Society. Where else in the world could one see anything like it?

MEET THE ALLOW FAMILY Eva Willes Wangsgaard

= The family of plants called the mallows (Malvaceae) is a large and varied one, representing in origin many lands and many nations of the Northern Hemisphere, and widely cultivated in numerous areas of the world. More than thirty branches (species) of this populous family have been identified and their geographic homes charted in the heritage of plants. The mallows are annual, biennial, and perennial, growing as small trees, as shrubs, as sturdy or fragile stems, and as small, persistent weeds. Mallow leaves are variously lobed or deeply cut. Some of them are of glossy texture, and others are fuzzy and webbed. The blossoms are single or double, or very double, some of them beautifully fluted, wearing many tints and tones of rose and red, purple, delicate bluish-violet, creamy white, or pure white.

The hollyhock (Althaea rosea, native of China) growing stiff, straight, and tall, makes a magnificent backdrop for the garden stage. Another Althea, the rose of Sharon (native to Eastern Asia), is often called by observant children, "the hollyhock tree." It does resemble a tree in dwarf proportions. Usually, the rose of Sharon grows on a single woody trunk with branches forming a close-limbed oval a few feet from the ground. This shrub is hardy, fast growing, and a prolific bloomer. The flowers are of many pastel tones from deep lavender, through pink, to pure white, sometimes mottled or striped.

The hibiscus is the aristocrat of the mallow family. Instead of the large, rough, roundish leaf of the hollyhock, or the smooth, fine-textured, deep-green, slightly dentated leaf of the Althea, plants of the hibiscus genus have dentate or lobed leaves, and large, showy flowers. They range in color from deep red, almost maroon, to rose, deep pink, light pink, and white, with petals rose-washed at the center. In size, they vary from a saucer-size to blossoms as large as a family fruit bowl.

From the dwarf mallow to the hollyhock, to the rose of Sharon, and the hibiscus, the texture and the tinting and the rufflings and the flutings are a delight. Why don't you invite the mallows into your garden and enjoy a satisfying and colorful friendship with their fluted petals and their radiant color?

ASTER EGGS
Make sugar mixture by combining: 2 c. Granulated sugar, 2 tbsp. Ice water. Mix with back of spoon until moist throughout. Mixture is just right if, when squeezed in hand, it leaves imprint of fingers on mixture.
Using plastic egg molds that separate in half lengthwise, press sugar mixture into each half with thumbs, working towards edges and making walls from % to %-inch thick. At pointed end of egg, scoop out a half circle to make the peek-through. Carefully lay a piece of cardboard over the top and invert it so that sugar egg half comes out onto cardboard. Allow eggs to dry overnight.
Scrape bottom off half of the molds to flatten them slightly for standing, then fill the eggs with green grass, tiny Easter eggs, wee little chicks, or cut out scenes, miniature plastic flowers, or even a tiny cutout snapshot of each of the children. Adjust top half of the egg over bottom and seal the two together with a bit of decorating frosting.
Put frosting into cake decorator and pipe around the seam, then around the peek-through opening, and anyplace else desired, either to decorate or to attach decorations, such as gold braid or flowers to egg. Frosting may be tinted any color, as may sugar mixture, for making the eggs.

Decorating Frosting
Beat together until very thick 2 egg whites, 2 c. Powdered sugar, and a dash of cream of tartar.
Be sure to keep the bowl covered with damp cloth when not in use, as this frosting hardens quickly.

Se <x Ph �_ < J <x =< i i i I shall never forget my first trip to Kalaupapa. We had arrived in Hawaii just a short time before. My husband had been called to preside over the Hawaii Mission, and he had carried with him for over twenty-five years the vivid memory of another visit when he had served as a missionary in Hawali as a young man. We walked down the pali (cliff) on a steep and rocky trail and arrived at Kalaupapa an hour and a half later, muddy and a little tired. A meeting was held in the branch chapel that evening and, for the first time, I met the dear people of Kalaupapa. They bore their testimonies and sang for us. I remember their rendition of "Hawaii Aloha." They sang like angels.

There began the association of three years during which time I became even more enamored of the people and the place.

Kalawao is a small peninsula nestled at the foot of a sheer pali on the northern shore of the island of Molokai. On the tip of the peninsula is a small hill on which stands a lighthouse, and on the leeward side, lies the settlement of Kalaupapa. Here and there are graceful palm trees and other greenery, and homes neatly situated on the quiet streets.

The ocean which surrounds Kalaupapa is beautiful in all its moods, sweeping in long, white-crested breakers on the lee side, and splashing with vigor against the cliffs that rise in rugged succession on the windward shore. Here one finds a spot shut off from the rest of the world.

No wonder this peninsula, isolated by the cliffs of "top-side" Molokai on one side, and the ocean on three sides, was chosen by King Kamehameha V, in 1865, as the site where those afflicted with Hansen's disease (leprosy) could be isolated to stop the spread of the disease. It was on January 6, 1866, that the first boat carrying nine men and three women arrived, and the first settlement at Kalawao, two and a half miles across the base of the peninsula from the present Kalaupapa settlement, was established.

Life was very difficult in those early days. Doctors visited the settlement rarely and could do little to arrest the progress of the disease. Law and order were difficult to enforce.

The windward side of the peninsula, where Kalawao was established, was lush and green, but it was also damp, and other illnesses came upon the patients. Over the years improvements have come. The selfless dedication of a Catholic Priest—Father Damien—is well known. He arrived in 1873, intending to stay for two or three weeks, but instead he spent the next sixteen years administering to the physical and spiritual needs of the patients—and then died, a victim of Hansen's disease. The settlement was moved from Kalawao to Kalaupapa, and health conditions were improved considerably. Law and order were established, and the needs of the patients provided for by the government.

And, Transparencies by Imogene Woodbury 209 March 1968
Finally, the use of sulfone drugs, beginning in 1946, caused Hansen's disease to recede greatly. In July of 1965, there were only about sixty cases of Hansen's disease in the settlement. Another 135 who have resided there still marks his burial place. The early saints not only had to collect all the money but do all the work, and they were all patients. Money was very scarce. The patients were given an allowance of fifty cents a week which made saving for the chapel a difficult task. A one-foot by twelve-feet board could be purchased for twenty-five cents, however, so as they were able to save a little; they used the money for nails, shingles, and the bell. Bells were very important—and very expensive. When the barge came in, all the material, even the precious bell, was just thrown overboard, and the men had to swim out and either push or pull it to shore before it was washed out to sea.

The members loved this old chapel, which they named "The New Jerusalem." For over sixty years it stood and, for sixty years they worshipped within its walls. Termites began their destructive work, however, and, in 1956, a new chapel was erected under the Church Building Program, and the old one was torn down. A large group of workers, directed by than members. All worked hard, and some of those with disabilities had their hands wired to the wheelbarrows that they might do their share. This beautiful new chapel is modern and lovely in every way, and representative of the spirit of courage and aloha that is found in Kalaupapa.

Two weeks later the dedication luau was held with President Sing's pig and the cooperation of the entire settlement—all of whom had been invited to share in the happiness at the completion and dedication of the 210 Kalaupapa—Place of Refuge Latter-day Saint chapel. Two large lanais had been constructed, consisting of frame structures covered with palm fronds brightened here and there with poinsettias and hibiscus. Under the lanais were long tables and benches, and here the luau was served, with one lanai for the patients and one for the non-patients. Then all present joined in singing.

The sun was shining, the ocean was blue—and in Kalaupapa there was peace and happiness.

Mary Sing came to Kalaupapa as a girl of seventeen, and it has been her home for fifty-one years. Here she met Jack Sing and married him. For thirty-five years they have been sweethearts, while giving of their time and talents to the Lord. Mary is the president of the Kalaupapa Relief Society, a position she has held for twenty-three years, and during most of this time she has also been the secretary. She joined the Church in 1928, and has been a Relief Society visiting teacher ever since, adding up to forty years of visiting service. Gentle and kind, with a quick sense of humor, she watches over the needs of the Relief Society members in the branch.

It is not at all unusual to find on her monthly Relief Society report that 100 per cent visiting teaching has been done, or that many visits have been made to the sick.

I shall never forget my first visit to Kalaupapa nor any of those since—for Kalaupapa is beautiful and unforgettable—there is a special spirit in that lovely place.

9 Sowing V. A. 1 ai, "S 4 Catherine B. Bowles
What have you sent to the garden of God?
While you live here on this earthly sod?

One kind act to one in need,
One whispered word of love.
The hungry soul you helped to feed
With faith in him above.

One broken heart was mended
Of deepest sorrows there.
Did you make the burden lighter
With love that all may share?

Did you soothe a tempest raging
In a heart so sorely tried?
And poured the balm of friendship
Where love and faith abide?

If so, you make your garden shine,
Each plant, a token there,
Will fill your heart with gratitude
That in his presence you may share.

The thought came to me as I was freshening up the guest room that Mother's visits had always been timed, somehow, to coincide with crises in our lives. At first, there had been the almost yearly occasions when she came to help us settle in our newest baby.
"IT guess you'd never come to see us," Andy had said to her on one of these occasions, "if we didn't have a baby every year! Come to think of it, there must be a cheaper reason for a visit!"
"It just gives me a good excuse—I'd come anyway—but don't you know a visit from her mother, a bit of pampering from her husband—and a new house coat are the only immediate rewards a girl gets for having a new baby?" Mother said, and we all laughed.

Two years ago when Mother had visited us, I had been discouraged with my seeming inefficiency as a homemaker, seeing my life as insignificant. Mother had somehow made me feel that my work as a mother was more creative than I felt.
"... Your home is a laboratory—a studio—where children are being shaped into men and women," she had said.

That crisis had passed; now there was another. Andy's company was transferring him to Portland, a thousand miles away, and he was leaving next week. At first he had taken it for granted we would all go, but I had convinced him that it would be better for him to go now—the children and I to join him in the spring.
"It's just too cruel to uproot them now—the middle of the school term—they've got a good start in dancing— their music. Let's give them time to get used
* Editor's note: See "A Time to Every Purpose," February 1966.

to the idea of leaving their friends; they'd be shattered." I had said, and Andy was convinced—too easily. I had convinced him, and then, perversely, was vaguely uneasy about it!

Had he given in because he was hurt by my suggestion, or was he glad to go alone? Well, I thought now as I dusted the rocking chair and put a vase of flowers on the dresser, at least the house is clean, and I will not bother Mother with my problems this time. Mother was coming that night, on the late flight. We left the children with a neighbor girl and went to meet her. On the way to the airport, Andy turned the car off the freeway and drove up the old road, to the top of the hill where the lights of our little city were spread out below—varicolored, twinkling jewels, thrown at random on black velvet. "We have some time; let's look at the lights and talk," Andy said, putting his arm around me, trying to pull me close. I turned one shoulder stiffly, and sat hard on my side of the seat. Not this time, I thought, he always thinks whatever is wrong between us can be erased by this. He put his hands back on the steering wheel, straightened his arms to push his back against the seat.

Looking at his hands on the wheel made me remember other times when we would drive up here and I would wait, not able to breathe, until his arms were around me. "Pat," he said now, "what's wrong with us? We used to just look at each other and know what the other was thinking, wanting... Lately I don't know what you're thinking or—sometimes now I look at you in church across our lineup of kids, and I remember how you used to manage to sit by me! I think—she's lovely, but do you know something? I try to picture you, now, doing things the wonderful, sweet, crazy way you used to do—and the picture won't come." "I've tried to learn a few things.... Lately I've been getting your things ready to go," I said. "Honey, you do fine," Andy said quickly, "in fact," he grimaced, "maybe you're Getting too efficient! I miss the girl who used to serve the pie while the potatoes and meat were cooking—and put the baby to bed with his shoes on to keep his feet warm—and—sometimes asked even stupid me for advice!" He drummed gently on the wheel with his fist as he said slowly, "Oh, yes—getting my things ready to go. You're very efficient about that! I wish."

What perverseness made me break in with "Let's go! If a man doesn't want to be pleased." On the way home from the airport, Andy told Mother about the new job. She said, "Oh, my! I should never have come at this time! There must be a million things you have to do, getting a family ready to move." 213 March 1968

I tensed as Andy said, "Oh, Pat and the youngsters aren't going now; just me," and listened for Mother's tone when she answered only "Oh." As always, Mother was a joy to have for a visit. Her career, presenting her original music and poetry to groups all over the country, has given her a sweetness and depth that is something to behold!

The day before Mother—and Andy—were to leave, I was alone in the bedroom packing his good clothes. Mother tapped on the half-open door and came in. There I stood, Andy's suit jacket crumpled in my hands, my cheek against it. "Patricia, darling—whatever are you crying about?" Mother asked, taking the jacket from my hands. "Here—see now—you've got it all wet." She pulled me gently to sit beside her on the bed. "Do you want to tell me what's wrong?"

"I—I made up my mind that this time—always before when you came—you gave so much—I made up my mind that this time I wouldn't let you know anything was wrong—and then—I could tell you knew anyhow. Did Andy say anything to you?" I was wailing between words.

"No," Mother said, "was there something he was supposed to tell me?"

"No, I guess not," I said. "It's just that." I looked around the room at Andy's scattered clothes—the open bags—and I felt my throat ache thickly, my eyes smart with tears. "I've been so mixed up for the past year or so—and now—I thought I wanted Andy to go without me. It was my idea, Mother—or at least I thought it was—and then just now I went to put his suit in the suitcase—and it—it smelled like him—and I remembered when we were first married—and whenever he had to be away overnight I'd tuck notes in his pockets, Mother—love notes—saying how lonely I was—and now he wants to leave me."

Mother took my hands down from my face. "But you said it was your idea," she said.

I moved from the bed to look out the window, not seeing anything. I turned to sit in a chair near Mother. "I'd just as well tell you," I said. "You'll think my life is like a soap opera—just living from one crisis to another! But this thing—Andy going away—and how I thought I felt about it—and wondering how Andy really feels—Mother, did you ever want Daddy to go away? Did it ever seem to you that—that just—just coping with marriage was too much for you?"

"Well," Mother said thoughtfully, "one is so inclined to remember only the good times! A human relationship is so complicated—takes so long to build and changes so often—but, yes, I think that in the structure of any marriage there would be some wanting to get away."

"I've been feeling so—so—married, Mother! So horribly, finally married, and it's like a trap! There's no excitement—no joy! I know everything about Andy—or I thought I did—and what he's going to say before he opens his mouth. Is this all there's going to be, forever, this sameness?" I said.

Mother took her turn looking out the window. "If only," she said, "they wouldn't end the stories with 'They lived happily ever after!'"

"Do you know what I think?" I said. "It's cynical, I know, and not like me—the one that couldn't wait to get married! But this is it: marriage is a big blaze of excitement—an attraction to assure that you'll, get married; it's momentary flashes of that attraction to assure the advent of babies—and then the sociological phase sets in—you know, keep the institution of marriage going for the good of society—and just try not to die of boredom!" "Oh, Patricia," Mother said, "you never used to be bored—ever! Be careful when you feel this way—discouragement and boredom are such potent weapons for Satan! Does Andy know how you feel?"

"I've never told him," I said. "I guess you've noticed we don't talk much. But he's noticed changes—he complains about the way things are. I guess some women pretend to feel the way they did—it seems dishonest to me!" I picked up a clothes brush and squeezed the bristles as I wailed, "Oh, it's so complicated!

Why couldn't life stay the way it was? I'm so mixed up—Mother, where did my happiness go?" Before Mother had time to answer, the children came home from Primary, and there was no opportunity for further talk. Mother insisted that Andy and I go out that night, leaving Where Did My Happiness Go? The children with her. Her "going away present" for Andy, she said, since both he and she were going away! We went to a movie, but my heart wasn't in it. I knew Andy and I had something that needed to be said; I needed to know how he felt about me—and going away alone. But I couldn't ask him, because even if he had begged me to go, I was not sure what I would have said. He might have been one of the shadow-figures on the screen, for all I could communicate with him! Andy took Mother to Danton, where her next engagement was, before he went to work the next morning. I almost envied her, as I kissed her goodbye, knowing each day would bring new places, new experiences.

Ellen had slept with Mother in the guest room, and when she came out that morning she was carrying an envelope addressed to me. "Look, Mama," she said, "Granny Witch typed you a letter last night." "What an awful name for your Grandma!" I said. "She only told you her name was Granny Witch to tease you. You are not to call her that! Give me the letter." I put the letter in my skirt pocket, hoarding the pleasure of reading it until Ellen was cared for.

I went into the guest room and closed the door. Crayoned pictures of strange, lopsided houses and people with arms growing out of their heads were lined up on the dresser where Mother had put them, to show proper appreciation for Ellen's art. The scent of Mother's cologne clung to the pillow I pushed under my head as I lay across the bed to read what she had written.

"Patricia," she had begun, "how I wish I had the wisdom of Solomon tonight! You said to me, 'Mother, where did happiness go?' and if I live my lifetime only to help you find the answer—then my life will have been well-spent and meaningful!"

Where did your happiness go? The happiness you were speaking of—the happiness that came unearned and free because you were young and pretty has gone. It died as a mushroom dies because it sprang, without roots, and too quickly—and like the mushroom, this happiness did not contain nourishment enough to sustain itself—or a mature marriage!

But from the ashes of that ephemeral happiness can come a real joy—a phoenix so strong and beautiful that it will make life worth living for you—in this life and through all the eternities.

When you said, "Where did my happiness go?" I am sure you meant "Where did my love for Andy go?" for it was your feeling for him that triggered the question. It has not gone, Patricia; it is changing. Change is the law of life, an eternal progression that does not find us today as we were yesterday; our challenge is to channel change in the right direction.

To us married in the temple for time and eternity, the concept of marriage is especially challenging. Whatever marriage we build here—it is ours forever! What an incentive to keep love alive!

Patricia, this is a period of assessment in your marriage—a time when you are taking a new look at Andy—and I am sure he is looking newly at you also. This is the time, darling, when Satan whispers to so many, "find somebody new—a different husband will make it the way it used to be!" Liar that he is, he doesn't tell them that a new look at their marriage is what they need, that it has changed because they have changed!

Start by putting Andy first! Your love for each other is the most important thing in your life, and in your children's, for they will be secure and free to develop only if they see that you and Andy love each other. Children must see love demonstrated.

When you were a child, did you connect the sacrifice we made to buy you clothes and food with love? Of course not, but you often speak of the "family hugs" we had, when you felt we all loved each other. Patricia, why don't you kiss Andy goodbye when he leaves for the day? The wife sets the emotional temperature of the home, and if coldness prevails, you will miss the warmth in your winter days!

A man starved for warmth is looking for it, whether he knows it or not—and he will find it, as the hungry man's eye will see food signs, and his nose will pick up food scents as he walks down the street!

Build Andy up as the leader in your marriage. He holds the priesthood, and it is his privilege and duty. "Ah," you say, "but he does not lead with the right spirit! He doesn't want to be bothered." Then, darling, encourage him! Stand back—let him lead—and you will see him grow.

It was such a blessing to me as you were growing up to know that your father was skilled—in guiding our family, so that all the awful responsibility was not mine!

You see, Patricia, it is, in a wonderful kind of way, selfishness—this building a happy marriage; if Andy is happy and fulfilled—then the friction is gone, and the energy that used to go into jockeying for family leadership can go into loving plans for your happiness and fulfillment.

Patricia, don't fall into the trap of making Andy abdicate his leadership—and then despise him for his weakness! Woman is strong enough to help her husband to become his very best!

Where did your happiness go? Your real happiness is within you, but you will have to cultivate and nourish it, and its growth will be slow. There is a certain sameness to daily living, but challenge this sameness by making sure that every day there is a memory for you and Andy to share—you two out of all the world. The twittering of waking birds in the morning; a campaign To help a child have a perfect day; a sunset; when you go out in public, look at him, talk to him as if it were your first date.

Try this, and you will be surprised at the way your love will blossom. Don't let this love die! Keep it so fresh that Andy's will be the first face you will look for on resurrection morning."

I could read no farther on the final page. Tears blurred my eyes. "Oh, Mother," I said, pushing the pillow over my face, hard, "you know me better than I know myself!"

Am I ever going to grow up?" When it was time for Andy to get on the train that night, I still hadn't told him I had changed my mind—I was coming to him as soon as I could. I kissed him so long and hard that he gave me a slow, appraising look, though, as he swung up the train steps. I saw him through the window, settling into a seat. Suddenly I was running through the crowd on the platform, yelling "Andy, Andy, darling!" I was thankful when he saw me and raised the window, just as the train started to move. "Darling," I yelled, running now to keep up with the train, "look in your pocket—not that one—the inside—there's a note—read it quickly! Call me—look for a house, anything that will hold us all—I love you, darling!" He was laughing, the last I saw of him as the train gathered speed, and it didn't occur to me at the time that my race with the train would be the first memory of our awakened marriage!

QUIET LOVELINESS

Grace Barker Wilson

The loveliest of earthly things
Move softly as the gauzy wings
Of brilliant Springtime butterflies.

You cannot hear an opening rose,
Nor catch the sound of grass that grows:
In silence white clouds rise.
The rainbow
Stretches, proud and tall;
Leaves change to scarlet in the fall
In quietness at nature's nod.

The stars, the moon, the sunlight, too,
Send a soundless message through:
"Be still, and know that I am God."

TRANQUILITY

Gladys Hesser Burnham

It was a beautiful, warm day in early autumn when I felt the need of a change of scene for poetic inspiration. I drove down to the lake made by Off. In the distance, a plane that had taken off from the airport climbed swiftly, the drone of its engines coming faintly across the water. A fish jumped, sending ripples in ever-widening circles until the wavelets struck the cattails encircling a spot of higher ground. A soft lapping could be heard. A swarm of gnats hissed by. How calm and peaceful! The traffic drone was almost indistinguishable in the long distance. What a perfect place in which to gather one's thoughts, to release tensions, drowse lazily and inhale a calm nostalgia, with the tranquility of this scene.

THAT DEAR YOUNG MAN

Throw Down Chapter 7

SYNOPSIS: Nancy Jackson, with two children, accompanies her husband Grant on a teaching assignment on the Island of Truk, where they live in a quonset hut. However, Nancy is told by a native doctor that she will have to go to a hospital on Guam for the birth of twins. In the meantime, a letter arrives from their friends, the Mortensens, who live on Saipan, saying that a teacher will exchange teaching assignments with Grant, so that the Jacksons can make their home on Saipan as neighbors of the Mortensens. Upon their arrival, a native maid, Soledad, takes charge of the children. Twin boys are born to the Jacksons, and soon afterwards, Nancy resumes most of the care of her family. They find much delight in exploring their island home and learning the customs of the native people.

The Gauntlet

Janet W. Breeze

Boonie fires had to burn themselves out. There was no alternative. The one small fire engine owned by the Municipality of Saipan could, at best, Nancy was convinced, spray forth no more water than a garden hose. And so it was with sighs of relief that the inhabitants of the island once again felt the rain sting the backs of their necks, whether gardening at home, or venturing forth on a picnic to a "hidden" beach.

The only thing wrong with Ladder Beach, Nancy decided, was that it had no ladder. One sawed-off telephone pole propped against the cliff was the only means of lowering anyone down to the secluded cove where violent, free waves broke into frothy white as they stumbled and fell against the coral table. "Picnicking at Ladder Beach is about as silly as swimming Lake Susupe," Grant said, as he stood at the top of the short cliff and dropped a pan of fried chicken down to Charles Mortensen.

"Say, I never did get the full story on that," Charles said.

"You haven't missed anything," Nancy interrupted. "I was never so scared—nor so disappointed in my whole life!"

"What she means," Grant said, "was that we swam part way and dragged bottom part way!"

"It was pretty exciting, though," Nancy said, "when it started getting darker and we weren't too sure if we were going straight. But some people on the shore saw us and panicked to think anyone was swimming in the lake. So they built a big fire to guide us, and by the time we reached the shore, I think the entire village of Susupe was standing around staring."

"Well, you can't say life in the tropics ever gets dull!" Francine laughed.

"And while we're on the subject of adventuring—Charles and I would like to take you into the 'boonies' when we've finished eating and show you something I think you'll be quite interested in. It's straight out of an old Tarzan movie!"

"Sounds exciting," Nancy said.

"You know, we've been here on Saipan ten months, but every time we start thinking we know all about the island and the people, the more we know we don't know. I venture to say that it's the most historically complicated fourteen miles by six miles in the whole world!"

With this, Nancy carefully stepped and handed her way backwards down the propped pole. Then, upon lifting Skipper and Amy down off the pole, both families of children headed straight for a nearby cave.

"Think that's the one thing they love about this place the most," Nancy said, "finding those sea shells with the little crabs in them."

When Grant jumped down with the last armload of food, Nancy and

"Francine began spreading out the lunch as the two men built a fire on the sand.

"In fact," Nancy said, "I think this whole experience has made our family so much more aware of the little things in life which used to pass us by. Back home, the children were not happy unless they were being entertained by television—or friends. It never would have entered their minds to flop down on their stomachs and watch ants march through the grass the way they lie on the sand and race crabs here. I'll admit that the crabs are probably more exciting, but still I can't help but think that we could have had just as many adventures at home if we had taken the time to really look for them."

"If you were like me," Francine said, handing Nancy the chip dip, "you probably spent most of your time picking up and putting away. By the time the house was straight, you were too tired to do much exploring."

"You know the answer to that, don't you?" Nancy said.

"You'd better believe it!" Charles said.

"You know, when Francine was packing, I'll bet she cried for a week about all the things she had to get rid of. We sent only what was absolutely necessary. But by the time the shipment got here, we had so adjusted our lives to getting along without even if— that we weeded out again!" "Actually," Nancy said, "it was probably the greatest shock of my life, unpacking after two months and finding things I had forgotten I ever had. Now why did I buy them in the first place?" "When we do go back to stateside living," Francine said, "that is the one souvenir I want to take with me— simplicity. If I never learn another thing in my whole life, I hope I can always remember how uncluttered and uncomplicated the lives of these happy islanders really are." "It was funny," Grant chuckled, "the day we first came, Nancy and I were both shocked to see the women simply standing out in the water in their house dresses to fish! We figured these people must be terribly poor not to have swimming attire of some kind. But it took only once for us to cut our feet on the coral and to get sunburned badly before we discovered the Micronesians were only being wise to enter the water fully clothed." At the mere suggestion that Throw Down the Gauntlet there might be approval, Skipper tramped out into the water and sat down with a forceful, giggly splash. Then each of the picnickers helped himself to the informal setting of food, eating wherever and whenever he wished. And Nancy lay face down in the warm, white sand, sifting the tiny particles through her fingers. There she became awed at the almost microscopic world of round, pearl-like shells and porous chips of coral which had previously gone unnoticed under the bareness of her footsteps. Rolling over on her back, she marveled at the tint of ultramarine blue in the zinc white sky, and felt as if she were inside a huge dome. Inside her dome, the world ended at the sea's horizon and Saipan alone was covered with a breathtaking convex lid. As she watched the nebulous clouds grow and age with gray, it was a reminder that the rainy season was once more upon them. "Actually, the rainy season is not the best time of year to be doing a thing like this," Francine said, as she directed them away from the beach to a new adventure of exploring. "But whether you can breathe in here or not, this is something you must see!" As they stepped and pushed their way through the dense, fern-like tangantangan, Nancy carried one of the twins, and Grant the other. Amy and Skipper ran merrily ahead, chasing after the bouncing toads which crisscrossed their path. And then before them on the compost path stood Francine's fairy-tale surprise—a pre-war 221 March 1968 structure of white concrete, its meticulously designed rotunda scarred with creeping, black mold. "This was the city hospital of Garapan," Francine said. "Now all that remains is just a handful of bombed-out ruins hidden deep in the boonies where the residents don't have to be reminded of the past." They stepped carefully over weathered boards and other debris, down a white-tiled corridor and out into a "sleeping beauty" courtyard. Through an aisleway of giant taro, they came upon another building, small and square. Francine climbed the steps and knocked on the door. "Don't tell me someone dives here!" Nancy said. "No," Francine giggled, "but I want to let all the toads and geckos know we're coming!" Then she opened the door and both families stepped inside. "See there!" Francine said, "above the door." "It's fantastic!" exclaimed. "How come they painted a picture on the wall when nobody lives here, Mama?" Amy asked. "People say this was an isolation ward," Francine said, "and that this scene depicting primitive island life was undoubtedly done by one of the patients." "But the colors!" Grant said, "they're so vivid! Why, the whole thing is in perfect condition!" "The front of the huts look as if they could have been carved and painted in Paluan storyboard fashion," Charles said, "so perhaps this was not a scene remembered in the Marianas." Nancy thought only of how long and pleasantly full another day had been, as they worked their way back to their cars in the pale green twilight. "Skipper," Nancy said, "come and get in the car, honey." She turned and looked behind her. "Skipper? Skipper!" But the child did not answer. "Grant? Oh, Grant. He can't be lost! Not here in the boonies!" "Relax," Francine said, "no one ever gets lost here very long. You know, yourself, the boonies are full of shacks and people." "Since he obviously didn't come this way," Grant said, "let's just walk back in the opposite direction until we come to something. Maybe someone will have seen him. Come on, Nancy. Let Francine and Charles stay with the other children and we'll go and find him." But as the darkness slowly rose from the jungle floor, and Nancy continually tripped over tangled branches and roots and found herself grasping at Grant with tightened fingers, her fear for Skipper mounted. Finally Grant patted her hand. "It's all right, honey," he said as they stepped and probed slowly along, "I can see a fire up ahead." Around a huge iron cooking pot atop the soft orange glow, little brown faces shone, and then up popped one little sunbleached head. Its mouth opened and one hand stiffened out to slice the air at a make-believe coconut. "Skipper!" Nancy ran to him unaware that anyone else had observed their approach and her relief. As she knelt on the ground embracing her son, a Saipanese man arose from his squatting position in the shadows and came forward into the light. "This your boy, Missus?" "Oh, yes," Nancy said, "and we were so worried!" "Him good boy." "Thank you." She stroked Skipper's hair with her hand. "T give you a drink?" he asked. "No, thank you," Grant said, "we have to get back to the rest of our family." "IT give you banana!" He disappeared back into the shadows as the three of them stood selfconsciously in the firelight. Then the man appeared again, this time with a large stock of green bananas supported on his shoulder. He hesitated and pointed back into the shadows. "You see old woman over there? She watch you. She say you look like Americano plane lady." "Like what?" "Old woman like big secret. You can come again tomorrow, when it light?" Nancy and Grant exchanged puzzled glances. "T guess so."

"T guess we can come back." The old woman in the shadows shook her head vigorously. "Not aim," the man said, you."

Halladay, and taught by Max Durrant, a local high school art instructor, was held in the stake center. The response was so great that three classes were required, instead of one as originally planned. Some entire families participated. Three objectives were studied: (1) a still life subject, using white, yellow ocher, raw umber, thalo blue, burnt sienna, and learning to mix colors; (2) a landscape scene using various shades of green; and (3) free rein to paint something of the student's choosing. All class members also learned to make their own frames, painting them colors to complement the pictures. Upon completion of the course, the stake Relief Society sponsored an art exhibit. Shown were 102 paintings of fifty students. Refreshments were served to a large group who were enthusiastic about the quality of the work displayed, and the display itself. We plan to make this an annual affair. Some of the art work is displayed in the picture."

INTRODUCTION When a woman marries and begins to rear a family, she assumes two roles, that of mother and also that of home nurse. The responsibility of keeping her eyes and ears open for early, telltale signs of illness falls to her, and rightly so, for she is the one who observes family members most closely—whether they are working, playing, or resting. Much of this observation is done without comment, since a mother can cause unnecessary apprehension on the part of her family if she seeks needlessly for symptoms of illness. SYMPTOMS OF ILLNESS a. Many diseases begin with upper respiratory symptoms, thus 234 illness occurring in the home. The nose and throat are affected. It is a good practice for the home nurse to check the throat when no illness is present so that she will be aware of the normal state of the throat and tonsils. To check the throat, have the family member tip his head back slightly and say "ah." By placing a spoon handle about two-thirds of the way back on the tongue and shining a flashlight into the mouth, the home nurse should be able to see to the back of the throat, checking for redness, swelling, spots, or patches. She should also note the condition of the tongue and any unusual odor of the breath. The symptoms presented by the nose are familiar ones: a watery or thick discharge or nasal stuffiness which impedes breathing. The latter is often a problem with infants because it interferes with their ability to suck. This should be discussed with the family doctor where it poses a problem. B. Occasionally, symptoms of illness are noted in the eyes. This would include: any unusual color of the white area of the eyes; any discharge, either watery or purulent; sensitivity to light or any other unusual condition. C. A mother notes, almost subconsciously, any changes in the skin of a small child as she bathes him. Such things as the color of the skin, dryness, a rash, or scattered pustules, sores, bruises, or reddened areas, all of these may be important symptoms in all age groups and must be evaluated and reported to the doctor as necessary. D. Digestive system complaints occur frequently in most families. Usually, the complaints are minor, but lack of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or excessive thirst which occur over a period of time may indicate a need for professional help. Sometimes general conditions such as irritability, fatigue, unusual sleepiness, even forgetfulness which comes on suddenly, are clues which may be important in the diagnosis of disease. When a family member mentions pain, the home nurse needs to know the location, type (continuous, intermittent, stabbing, throbbing), severity and time of onset, before she reports to the doctor. SEVEN DANGER SIGNALS OF CANCER Due to the efforts of the American Cancer Society, people have become more aware of the seven danger signals of cancer. Because cancer is a menace which can be defeated if detected early, each home nurse should familiarize herself with these seven signs: 1. Changes in a wart or mole; 2. A chronic cough or hoarseness; 3. A change in bowel habits; 4. A non-healing wound; 5. A lump appearing anywhere; 6. Unusual bleeding or discharge from any body orifice; 7. Indigestion or difficulty swallowing. These symptoms may indicate problems other than cancer, but they should be brought to the doctor's attention so that he can determine the cause and begin treatment. THE FACTOR OF AGE It is important, also, to remember that age may be a factor, since children often become ill very quickly, showing acute symptoms. Thus, a child may be playing happily one minute and be prostrate on the bed the next with a flushed face and high fever. On the other hand, illness in older people may develop very slowly, with symptoms which are 235 March 1968 much less marked. For this reason, the home nurse may need to check signs over a period of days, to note a change in the usual pattern of living. THE HOME NURSE When the home nurse suspects illness, she usually takes the temperature, pulse, and respiration of the patient before she calls the doctor. This does not mean that this should be done on all family members each day, but that a thermometer and a watch or clock with a second hand are valuable tools for the home nurse. When illness occurs in the home, a daily record helps the home nurse to keep an accurate account of all the information * the doctor will need for diagnosing or treating illness. The record should contain: date, time, temperature, pulse, and respiration; diet eaten, medicines given; a record of urine and stools passed by the patient and any symptoms mentioned earlier in this lesson. 236 asked to bring the patient to one of these two places. Where the patient is an adult who is seriously ill, as with a heart attack or stroke, an ambulance is the fastest and easiest way of transportation if available. A child can usually be bundled up and carried to a waiting car. Each home nurse should have available the number of the ambulance service nearest her. She should also have the number of the doctor in case a sudden emergency arises. If the doctor is making a home visit, the home nurse should put the patient to bed, carry out any measures suggested by the doctor over the phone and give the patient rest and emotional support until the doctor arrives. Note Additional information, suggestions, or helps may be available from health agencies, insurance companies, or government agencies.

PRAYER Christie Lund Coles Spare me from self-pity, Lord, Let my sympathy Be for those warped of mind, Those who cannot see The world of wonder and of truth, The mountains, rising tall; Aware of God's great goodness Around, about us all. Spare me from self-pity, Lord, Let each morning dawn As a new promise and a hope Knowing darkness gone, Knowing that the hardships Made me grow and stand Taller in the bright new day, Aware of his strong hand. + HAWAII CCS * MEXICO << * TEXAS HEMISFAIR * PALMYRA PAGEANT * ALASKA ADVENTURE For all travel and ticketing arrangements "MY TRAVEL INC." 110 East 2nd South 3 Salt Lake City, Utah 84103 Ogden, 399-4587 St. George, 673-3136 Logan 245-6584 Idaho Falls, 522-2581 Mesa 964-5283 Send for new 1968 catalog—50¢ Free instructions Home of complete handicraft supplies UTAH CRAFT & NOVELTY 3220 South State Street Salt Lake City, Utah 84115 486-1017 237 Cherry Street Besley CY T3 L B S U L B K MUSIC COMPANY MOVED We're growing.
