LOVE COMES ON LITTLE WINGS Lael W. Hill At the brink of four She is wholly of the world, Exactly the world's bright center, Singing an earnest love: Oh, little bird, she sings, Come down to me and let me hold you� She makes her hands into A tiny nest� Oh, lovely bird, she sings.... Oh, little butterfly, she sings, Come down to me, and I will kiss you� Her face is flower soft And lifted skyward� Oh, pretty butterfly, she sings. Her eyes are warm with waiting, Her mouth is all curved in eagerness; Under pink-petaled wind she stands tiptoe: Oh, little bird, she sings.

Roberts Art Layout: Dick Scopes Illustrations: Mary Scopes 241 I was so glad to see my picture in The Relief Society Magazine (hobby feature, January 1968). The sisters in the Fourth Ward were so thrilled over it. They said it lifted their hearts to have this representation. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Mrs. Mabel Lords, Pocatello, Idaho The Relief Society Magazine is awaited with eager anticipation each month. The stories, poems, editorials, in fact, the whole magazine is an inspiration. Our children and their little friends enjoyed immensely the gingerbread house made from directions in the December issue ("A House of Many Roofs," by Berta Mae C. Peek), and they could hardly wait until they were given permission to eat "the house." M. Jean Baty, Selkirk, Manitoba, Canada Thank you for the inspiring magazine. My husband took sick on Christmas night, and has been on the critical list. The magazine has given me such a great spiritual peace and comfort. I am of Spanish descent, from a Catholic family. My sister and I are the only members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, from our family. Our feelings are mutual when we say the gospel is true. I am grateful for the calling I have in Relief Society, as first counselor, for the beautiful lessons, and for the features in the magazine. The magazine is full of treasures. Mrs. Zanie L. Sears, Stafford, Virginia The real worth of the magazine lies in the enrichment it offers, from the exquisite cover to the last article. Its poems enhance sacred and common themes in words of beauty, while its stories provide genuine enjoyment. Menu and handicraft suggestions add variety to daily living. Arvita J. Workman, Hinckley, Utah I am very pleased with the artwork for my serial "Throw Down the Gauntlet" (concluded in April 1968). It's such fun to see someone else's concepts of my own mental pictures. Janet Breeze, Silver Spring, Maryland I was very happy to see my tablecloth displayed so beautifully in the December magazine (pages 922-923). It will be an issue especially treasured in our home. Maxine (Maxine Curtis, who wrote the article) was here for the holidays. We were both interested in all the other colorful displays. It was truly a splendid Christmas issue. Blanche T. Miner, Salt Lake City, Utah I have been edified with some of the reactions of the readers of our magazine. Said one "I want to stand around... waiting to see how the story ends. I simply save all the magazines until the story is finished—and then I read the entire story." A certain discriminatory lady, frail and refined, said to me that each chapter of a serial in the magazine leaves her cheated, because each chapter is too brief. "It is like nibbling the edge of a cookie, when I am hungry for the whole cookie." I am proud of our beautiful magazine. Minnie J. Hodapp, American Fork, Utah 242

Music for Daily Living Harold Lundstrom*

If There Is Anything Lovely Music for Daily Living Harold Lundstrom "This is," the chubby, wide-eyed fifth grader haltingly sobbed, "the most wonderful thing that has ever happened to me!" The musicians of the quartet on stage stood speechless; the 250 fourth, fifth, and sixth graders and their teachers held their breath, and a couple of us who were auditioning for "Young Audience, Inc.," concert could not believe our ears. Because the boy's words came so slowly and hesitatingly between his heaving sobs, there wasn't, I'm sure, a dry eye in the school's auditorium—least not among any of the adults. "The most wonderful thing" that this ten-year-old was so poignantly and piquantly telling us about was his first experience hearing great music and hearing it played by "live" musicians. All the music he had ever heard previously—or at least to which he had given his full attention—had either been rock-n-roll, or popular, Broadway musical, or movie tunes, and these he had heard over the radio, on television, or in motion picture shows. He represented a fine middle-class neighborhood, and the price of tickets for a concert—any kind of a concert—was not beyond the family's means. Somebody—his parents or other members of his kith and kin—had never enjoyed the fun *Member, Church General Music Committee; Deseret News Music and Dance Editor 244 of giving this boy an opportunity to hear how exciting great music sounds when it is performed by live musicians; somebody had neglected to pique his intellectual curiosity on how impressive a musical experience can be. The great violinist and human being, the late Fritz Kreisler, implied occasionally that a musical experience is worthwhile only if at some point one develops what is commonly called "goose flesh." This phenomenon is difficult to describe, much less to explain or analyze. But once it is experienced—as this music-starved young man discovered and so eloquently expressed—the desire to feel it again never ends. People arrive at the sensation of "goose flesh" for a variety of reasons. That ten-year-old that morning arrived at it through a live performance. Some persons reach it through some association, consciously or unconsciously. Doesn't every couple, for example, have a musical selection known as "our song"? It raises "goose flesh" because of some important occasion during their courtship. Some persons experience "goose flesh" when they sing or hear their school song. But when a listener has had no previous association with the piece and is really hearing it for the first time, the thrill is determined, generally, by what music, if any—and if so, what kind—to which he has been previously exposed. In a word, if the only music he has ever heard has been cowboy songs, he isn't likely to be touched by a Schubert string quartet, no matter how beautiful it is. "If There Is Anything Lovely." And so it is about time that good music be given the place it rightfully should have, not only among all the arts, but also as one of the essentials of our civilization, as one of the ingredients of our daily living. We hear almost everywhere—in our family, Church, social, business, and professional associations—a great deal of patronizing talk about the significance of the so-called "cultural explosion" allegedly taking place. We are proud, we boast, that we are members of a religious organization whose members are dedicated to the cultural and performing arts. But it can be the shocking experience of those engaged in the arts, either professionally or in lay civic music projects and programs, to discover in some of our homes that there are high school age and college age children who have never, in their entire lives, attended one professional concert or ballet, or one professional performance of a Shakespeare play, or who have the companionship of a book filled with reproductions of the world's great art, or who either own or have ever read one of the world's great books (except as a school assignment). It is easy enough for many of us to give lip service to the arts, to the concept of the Thirteenth Article of Faith: If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things. But, too frequently, as far as the cultural arts are concerned, it has been only lip service. Of course, the eternal argument as to what is good or bad in the arts comes down eventually to a matter of personal opinion. But there are certain towering masterpieces of music, drama, dance, and literature whose permanent values are universally recognized. Below them lies a mass of material of varying appeal, subject to individual taste. Still lower is the heap of unmitigated trash, which is, unfortunately, still the favorite haunt of the so-called "mass audience." But there can be no argument or disagreement concerning the exalted expressions of man's genius in the performing and fine arts. They have become established through the passage of time, not only by the careful study of conscientious scholars, but also by the cumulative approval of the average man himself. The story goes that a man once went to an exhibition of paintings. (One version of the story is that the exhibit was in the Louvre.) The man walked around all the galleries, paying particular attention to the old masters. As he left, an attendant said to him: "I hope you enjoyed our collection of paintings, Sir." "It isn't bad," the man answered, "but I didn't like your old masters." The attendant paused, and then said: "With all respect to you, Sir, it isn't the old masters who are on trial here." If there are some of us, as with the visitor, who couldn't stand or pass the trial either, what can or should we do about it? Before considering some answers, it should be stated that a principal reason for the neglect of listening to great and good music—i.e., "the most wonderful thing that has ever happened to me"—is that its techniques for performance are a complete mystery to the average person. People are constantly boasting, "I can't read a note." This falsely assumes that some special talent is required for a musical experience of any kind. Musical performance requires a language that very few people can either read or write, and this requirement, unfortunately, has created a handicap to its casual or serious study. But it is the repeated hearing of a masterpiece that really counts. The ability to read a note or a score is completely unnecessary for a listening thrill that will raise "goose flesh." How many babies (who didn't know a note) have been sung or hummed to sleep by their mothers? How many men (who didn't know a note) have taken up arms and marched to the defense of their loved ones and their country to the stirring music of a martial band? How do we avoid putting our child on trial when he goes out into the world?

He can be wonderfully exposed to great music even before he begins kindergarten by the frequent, and perhaps subtle, playing of great music on the family phonograph (hi-fi or stereo set). Fortunately, some kind of reproducing set can be purchased for as low as $25. And if the family budget doesn't permit much spending for records, almost every library has a record collection from which recordings can be borrowed in the same manner as books. After his child starts school, every parent should consider that his child's development is being impoverished, if circumstances permit, if he isn't taken to at least one professional concert, one great play professionally acted, visited one art gallery, or read one of the world's masterpieces each and every year until his child is through high school. As the fun and excitement of becoming involved in the performing and fine arts are being experienced, one of every parent's most rewarding challenges is to create good attitudes towards the arts. Much of the backwardness in musical taste can be blamed on the insistence of some well-intentioned but narrow-minded scholars who have persisted in considering the potential audience for good music an automatically limited one. This is snobbery of the most superficial stripe. Symphony orchestras, ballet and opera companies, repertory theaters, and concert series are still too generally regarded as objects of charity whose support is perhaps one's duty but hardly one's honest pleasure. The very word culture seems to create in the minds of too many a curious suspicion bordering on contempt, and the "highbrow" or "egghead" may be held up to ridicule. Such a situation cannot be relieved by either snobbery or hypocrisy. The sincere parent who wants to enrich his child's (and his own) life must find ways of removing the mystery and the mumbo-jumbo from the world's great and permanent compositions—or other cultural arts masterpieces—and help reach the enormous audience that is still virtually untouched. Parents can ask both themselves and their children as they hear great music (no matter through what medium): What does that piece make me think or feel? What did I hear? Did I like that? Why did the composer use violins rather than a piano? What color would best describe the sound of the flute? Why did the composer use that color? What color would I have used if I had composed that piece? It will be in answering this kind of question that parents and children can become involved in the excitements of musical experiences. It is not likely that anyone will ever become excited about music if, after he hears a piece, he asks himself (or his child): How much does a tuba weigh? Has that performer ever been on television? Or, for the kiss of death in developing an interest in listening to music: Was the last statement of the fugue subject to retrograde? What we are concerned with is selling ourselves (and our children) the fun and excitement and the joy of great and enobling music. We are not concerned with selling tubas, or television programs, or the technical forms of musical composition. And it is this department's belief that the best way is for us to discover and then articulate our own thoughts and feelings about what a certain piece of music does for us. This we can do by ourselves in listening at home or with our families after attending a concert together.

[Address Delivered at the Relief Society FJ Through The) Relief Society | Magazine Magazine Department Meeting of the Relief Society Annual General Conference, September 28, 1967]

Humbly I respond to the invitation to say a few words to you in this session of your conference, and ask that I may enjoy the interest of your faith and prayers in my behalf, for as King Benjamin inferred, there is an obligation on the part of the hearer as well as the giver. (Mosiah 2:9.) We have observed in our conference assignments to the stakes of the Church, that there is a spirit that radiates forth from the congregation. We have sensed this same thing here today and appreciate personally the lift that it gives. Over the years, having spent a good bit of our Church service in four bishoprics closely associated with the Relief Society organization, we have come to appreciate just what this great auxiliary means in the lives of the sisters of the Church and to know the countless services that are rendered.

The thought has occurred to me that only a small part of the effort expended and the good that is done can be recorded in the minutes, roll books, and reports. A Voice That Reaches

An organization like this must have a voice that can reach out into the homes of the sisters of the Church regularly, to lift, instruct, and inspire them. This voice is The Relief Society Magazine. It is a marvelous blessing to have membership in this Church, and an opportunity for service and self-development, to have been called and appointed to an assignment. Now we are assuming, for the purposes of our discussion, that all of you have an important assignment, that of representing the Magazine in your stake or mission, even though, today, some of you may be wearing more than one hat.

My purpose today is threefold: first, to impress upon you the quality and magnitude of the Magazine; second, to provide some practical helps in fulfilling your calling as a Magazine representative; third, if time permits, a personal testimony.

The Opened Door

I appreciate the theme of this session: "Open the Door Through The Relief Society Magazine." When first we read it, there came to mind the words of the Master, as recorded in Revelation 3:20: Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him and will sup with him, and he with me. We remember what President David O. McKay said to a group of missionaries in reference to this verse of scripture. In essence he said, no matter what your task in the Church may be, when you go forth in the strength of your calling, the Lord goes with you, for there are many ways to "knock at the door," and blessed is he or she who hears and answers.

Looking at it in this light, perhaps we can gain a different perspective for our calling. Quality and Magnitude of Magazine

Now a word about the quality and magnitude of your Magazine. The following comments were made by the wife of an eastern university president when she obtained a copy of The Relief Society Magazine from a friend. I took the copy home with me out of courtesy, and not really intending to read it. But then, out of curiosity, I began to glance through the pages, stopping to read an article by David O. McKay. This led us to read it through.

It has been a long time since we have seen any magazine that so impressed us with its lofty principles and useful information for women. We could not find one blemish of off-color material, nor was it suggestive in any way, which as we all know, is a rarity today. From this we have become interested in other Mormon literature.

We cannot attempt to assess the impact of the Magazine fully. Just how do you determine or measure how much it meant in the life of a sweet soul who joined the Church, and because of the attitude of her husband, was denied any association with her Church? She couldn't attend her meetings, nor affiliate in any way. Her contact with the Church severed, she was heartbroken, and then an idea occurred: perhaps he will let me subscribe to a Church publication. She pled with him, and at last he agreed, but just one. Her choice was The Relief Society Magazine, and for six and one-half years, this was her only contact with the Church. The only voice!

Magazine Production
The task of producing the Magazine is a formidable one. We are now (September 1967) printing, in the English edition, approximately 260,000 Magazines each month. Each issue requires about forty giant rolls of paper, 56,000 pounds, nearly a railroad car open the door through The Relief Society Magazine and one-half, or twenty-eight tons. If you could stretch this out in a continuous length, it would reach out for 225 miles thirty-five inches wide.

Many people are part of the team required to do the job: the Magazine editorial staff, contributing writers from the Church, artists, production coordinators, typotitors, lithographic technicians, cameramen, color experts, plate makers, pressmen, binders, deliverymen, mailers, saleswomen, and office workers are all instrumental in providing this excellent publication each and every month.

A FEW PRACTICAL HELPS ON SELLING THE MAGAZINE

If there is one thing we have learned in twenty years of selling, it is this: There are hundreds of volumes and countless booklets published on the subject of salesmanship, each one filled with methods of sure-fire success, and you may have some of these, as we do. However, we believe these can be condensed into four main points, keeping in mind that you are functioning in the Lord's work.

1. Be prepared with the facts.
2. Know where you are going.
3. Make the calls.
4. Ask for the order.

These four items suggest several sub-headings, and we shall mention a few of these.

BE PREPARED WITH THE FACTS
1. Become familiar with your product and know what is inside.
2. Know the subscription rate. (We once encountered a representative who didn't.)
3. Know the expiration dates on subscriptions in your territory.
4. Know how the Magazine will be sent to the homes and about when it will arrive. Know how to issue a receipt properly.

Compile a simple "sales kit" that may contain, among other items:
a. Some sample copies of the Magazine.
b. The pertinent facts.
c. A good success story about the Magazine.
d. Receipt book, pen, and calendar.
e. A list of advantages in having the Magazine in the home.
f. Some of your own creativity.

7. Know something about the sisters you will call upon.

KNOW WHERE YOU ARE GOING
1. Secure an up-to-date listing of the sisters of your ward or branch.
2. Check the names and addresses for accuracy.
3. Make an appointment and define a time limit for it.
4. Be on time and hold to the time limit.
5. Know something about the sisters you will call on, so your presentation can be tailor-made to suit each situation that you may encounter.

MAKE THE CALLS
Go out prayerfully. Face-to-face is best. Be enthusiastic. Be sold yourself, first. Mention some of the advantages of the Magazine. Sell benefits!
A. The Magazine specifically designed for the sisters of the Church.
B. It has high standards.
C. It contains messages from the prophet to the women of the Church. It is fun to read. Educational. Informative. It contains lesson material. It contains special features. Its literary value is high. It is a valuable source reference.

ONE MORE THING
Make your calls brief. There is a classic story on this point. It has to do with Pat Donahue of the Ortho-Vent Shoe Company, Salem, Virginia. He is a salesman who cannot talk or hear. He is a deaf mute. But he is the company's number-one salesman, having sold twenty-five pairs of shoes his first week. And he does it with a series of simple cards that briefly state his purpose, the product's advantages, and the price.

Show the product—the Magazine. Never argue. You may win the argument, but you will probably lose the sale. Bring out the hidden objection; perhaps it is a just one.

ASK FOR THE ORDER—CLOSE THE SALE
The choice-question is one of the best ways to close the sale. For example: "Do you want to pay for your Magazine with cash or check?" "Shall we have the first issue begin with October or November?"

Whatever you do, ask for the order!

If an objection arises, consider it, then go back over the strong selling points and close again.

Now, in conclusion, we hope that you will remember, above all, that you are serving your Heavenly Father in a way that can bring light and encouragement to the sisters in your area. Every Magazine placed in the homes of the Church is helping to combat, perhaps in a small way, the tremendous load of low standard publications dumped on to the public every day.

May the Lord bless you in your efforts.
I testify to the fact that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that he directs the affairs of his kingdom through his prophet President McKay, and we are all recipients of the blessings that result from service and dedication in his work. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

If Spring Be Late
Mabel Harmer

Chapter I

Maureen returned a dozen books to their proper places on the shelves, slipped her handbag into the bottom desk drawer, and said to her young assistant, "I'm going down to the office, Madge. You might return the rest of these books into their places. There probably won't be any children in this morning—what with school just starting."

The big rush will come after school and next Saturday." "Sure, Miss Taggart. Take your time." This was an hour to which she had looked forward for more than half of the twenty years she had been with the library. Not that she disliked her work. As a matter of fact, she loved it—especially since it was with children. But it was not her first choice for a full and happy life. When she had first dreamed of going to Miss Pine, the head librarian, she had expected to say, "I'm going to get married, Miss Pine. Johnny is coming home, and we plan to be married right away." Only Johnny hadn't come home. His plane had disappeared while flying the Hump over the jungles of Asia. The report was "Missing in action." For a long time Maureen had held out hope. She had heard of men fighting their way out of the jungle. But, as the years passed, hope dwindled and finally died. Sometimes when she passed a fair-haired lad on the streets, her heart thumped. Then she remembered. If Johnny had been alive he would no longer be a fair-haired lad in his mid-twenties. Maybe he would have thinning hair, or patches of gray. By the time she had finally given up hope of his return, there had not been many single men available. Anyway, she had never yet met anyone who could take the place of Johnny in her heart.

Miss Pine was interviewing an applicant, and Maureen waited discreetly outside until the woman left. As she came in, the librarian said, "It's amazing that anyone who wants a job thinks that she can step right into a library and go to work. It must look extremely easy." "Or pleasant," added Maureen. "Well, my visit is exactly the opposite. I came in to tender my resignation." "Not really!" exclaimed Miss Pine. "Why?" "A good question, and I have a great answer. I'm planning to go to England for some months and do genealogical research. My people came from there—England and Scotland. I've been saving and working toward this for a number of years. Now I'm ready to take off." "It sounds fascinating," agreed Miss Pine. "You'll do some traveling, too, of course. Tour the Continent and all of Britain. I hope to do the same myself someday—the touring, I mean. When do you plan to leave?" "In a couple of weeks. Madge can take over my work, and you can put an assistant on for her. I'll work right up to the time I go." "Will you fly over?" "Goodness, no! I've never been east of Denver. I'll go by bus so that I can see every mile of the country. And then by boat. I have reservations in October. It isn't difficult to get them at this time of the year. Nearly everyone is coming back instead of leaving." "Well, I'm very happy for you. And when you come back there'll always be a job here for you, if you want it. At least as long as I have anything to say about it." "Thank you very much."

As she walked back to the children's library, Maureen said to herself, "I wonder what she would have thought if I had said, 'Genealogy is only part of my reason for going. I have inherited a joint ownership in a castle in Scotland.' Miss Pine wouldn't have believed it, of course. Maureen hardly believed it herself, in spite of the letter she had received from her cousin, Bruce Taggart. Well, she would soon find out. In the meantime, it was exciting just to dream. In fact, it was the most exciting thing, dream or reality, that had happened in a score of years.

As she entered the library, she saw Harold Meacham waiting for her. A large boy, now in his late teens, he had been retarded by a childhood illness and never advanced beyond the third grade in reading level. He depended upon her to find books that were near his age in interest, and still in words simple enough for his understanding. She almost felt some guilt in leaving him. She must instruct Madge very carefully how to look out for him.

"Hello, Harold," she said brightly. "Have you finished all of those books so soon?" She picked out several more books, and he left, eager to be at them.

In the quiet of the library, she said, "Madge, I'm leaving." "Miss Taggart! You don't mean it!" "Indeed, I do. I'm going to England to spend several months. I'm going to do family research and some traveling."

"How perfectly marvelous! But I've heard that it's terribly cold in England in the winter. You must load up on scads of sweaters and ear muffs and—"

"And built-in foot warmers," laughed Maureen. "I guess that I can manage. Millions of other people have."

"Maybe you'll meet someone real exciting," Madge went on raptly, "like an IBM executive or a chap who conducts safaris—"

"On a bus, I am not likely to meet any executives. More likely it will be librarians, schoolteachers, and secretaries." "Then you should fly," Madge said emphatically. "I've often wondered why you never married. You're so attractive. With your white hair and young face I think you're simply stunning in navy blue or black."

"Thanks, honey. One reason is that I waited too long after my fiancé was lost. And there weren't too many men around after the war. Another real good reason is that I haven't been asked. Every normal woman—almost every one, at any rate—would like to marry. And I have been entirely alone since my mother died."

Madge nodded. "Yes, I suppose so. I worry day and night for fear I'll end up being a so-called career girl." Maureen laughed. "I've noticed how you worry—in-between the times your various admirers call. By the way, do take good care of Harold Meacham and see that he gets the right books to read."

"Sure," agreed Madge. "And try to persuade Gary to bring his back in time so that he doesn't have to pay fines. And give the hungry-looking Wilson children some cookies when they come and— you do an awful lot of mothering around here. I'm not even going to try and keep up with it."

"I'm not worried," smiled Maureen. "No one who didn't like children would stay in this department. She'd be down in information greeting all newcomers, or in research where the scholars abound." "Don't give me ideas," said Madge. "I might ask for a transfer. And don't forget to look for that IBM executive."

"I'll remember," Maureen promised, as she turned to help another patron.

That evening she started packing in earnest. Now that she had definitely resigned from her job, she was eager to hurry the project along. She had already rented the modest home where she had lived alone since the death of her mother, five years before.

She would empty dresser drawers and put away the few treasures that could not be left to the mercy of strangers, 255 April 1968 She had just stopped for dinner when the phone rang. Helen Morton, her closest friend was calling. "Hi, slave!" was the greeting. "We have important business on hand. I want you for dinner tomorrow night. Chuck's oldtime friend, Steve Madsen, has been transferred here. He's district manager for Roberts, Incorporated." "That wouldn't be IBM, would it?" asked Maureen. "Well, I guess they use them. It's appliances. Anyway, what does IBM have to do with it?" "It's just a joke. Madge suggested that I try to meet up with an IBM executive while I'm on my journeys." "This is just as good. He's been a widower for three years." "And he is woman shy?" "Frankly, that could be part of it," Helen agreed. "He has been pursued rather hotly. You know how it is. There seem to be so many more single women than men." "Yes, I know exactly how it is," said Maureen. "However, you can assure him that he will be perfectly safe with me. I'm leaving the territory for months, at least." "To be disgustingly honest, that may help. Although that wasn't why I invited you. In addition to being my best friend, you are far and away the most attractive, unattached woman I know." "Spoken like a true friend," said Maureen, "and adjudged in the same perspective, I'll try to sparkle enough to justify your choice." "Do that. I'll expect you at seven." Maureen could not help being 256 excited. Dinner invitations, other than with her fellow workers at the library, were few and far between. She looked over her clothes, trying to decide what to wear. The deep rose should be about right. It was not too dressy and was pretty with her white hair and the chalk white costume jewelry. For a brief moment she considered shopping tomorrow for something that would be extra special, but quickly decided against it. After all, this could be the beginning and the sudden end of a lovely friendship. She mustn't get any ideas. Helen had made that quite clear. Her only concession to the occasion was a new hair-do. She walked the short block to Helen's house and was pleased at the quick glance of approval that came from her friend. She was introduced to the guest as "Maureen Taggart—my dearest friend." The man who rose to greet her was only slightly taller than herself, and, while he may have missed being called handsome, his square jaw and intense blue eyes gave him very much the look of a "doer." His firm handclasp and friendly smile of welcome won her complete admiration. There were no other guests at the dinner, and the conversation was largely between the two men, starting with "Do you remember?" They had been roommates at college and close friends ever since. Later, Helen brought out a Scrabble set, remarking, "I speak to play with Maureen. As a librarian she knows all the words." "Only words of no more than two syllables," Maureen countered. "Remember I work with nothing over the sixth grade." "Then I reckon I'm stuck with Steve, and all he ever read was the newspaper and the stock market," said Chuck, as he drew up the chairs. Maureen and Helen won easily and, rather ruefully, she recalled the words of the poet, "I'm sorry that I spelled the word. I hate to go above you." Actually, no one had been too serious about the game. There had been more reminiscences and friendly banter. Maureen could honestly say that she had never spent a more pleasant evening as long as she could remember. When it was time to leave, Steve asked, "May I give you a lift?" "It's only a block," said Maureen, "but." "Good. Then I won't have to stop for gas along the way." They both thanked their hosts warmly for a pleasant evening and left. If Spring Be Late "Why don't we walk?" suggested Steve. "I'll just come back here for the car." "I'd like to very much," she replied. "There's something about the air in autumn that you don't have any other season." "When I was a kid," said Steve, "it was the odor of burning leaves. But that's taboo now. Anyway, September is a mite too early. Then there was the smell of chili sauce cooking in the kitchens. Do you make chili sauce?" "Not very often," she smiled. "I live alone and one batch every two or three years does me nicely." She started to go north, in the direction of her home, but he took her arm and turned her in the opposite direction. "We can't waste a night like this walking one insignificant little block. Around this other way will be much better. And maybe there'll be a moon—a harvest moon." "Not unless the walk lasts about two weeks," she replied. "Then we'll have to take another walk—in two weeks." Maureen felt pleasure and panic at the same moment. Pleasure that he quite evidently enjoyed her company and meant to further their friendship. Panic at the thought that in two weeks she would be on a bus leaving home for an indefinite stay. One bright fact rose above the others. He wasn't simply being agreeable because he knew she was going away. At her door, he said, "I've enjoyed the evening ever so much. I hope that I may see you again soon." 257 April 1968 "Yes, indeed," she replied. "Good. Then I'll call you as soon as there is something worth seeing, or hearing." The next morning she picked a huge bouquet of purple asters for her desk and left early for work so that she could walk and savor fully the lovely September day. There was just a suggestion of crispness in the air and the gardens seemed to be overflowing with vivid autumn blossoms. It can't be just the day that is different, she thought. It has to be myself. What irony! That she should meet the first man in whom she thought she could be really interested—in twenty years—just when she was going away. She couldn't possibly postpone her trip. Not that the information she wanted wouldn't still be there. Even the inheritance could be handled by her cousin. It was just that, remembering Helen's words, she felt rather sure that such an obvious step would put a sudden end to a blossoming friendship. Bronyway, she still had two weeks before she would take off on a bus for a cross-country trip to board the boat at New York. Madge was already at her desk when Maureen reached the library. "Hm—how beautiful!" she exclaimed admiringly. "Yes, aren't they! Asters remind me of highborn ladies." "I meant the lady herself. Isn't that a new dress?" "Yes, as a matter of fact. I bought it for my trip but thought that I might just as well dress up in it today. I'm glad you like it." 258 "I love it," declared Madge. "Also your new hairdo."

All of this couldn't be the result of that dinner date last night, could it?" Maureen could not help a slight blush. "Not entirely," she said. "I planted the asters last spring, you know." "Incidentally—how was it—or he? The dinner date, I mean, of course." "Fine. I had a very pleasant evening. Extra nice, really." Maureen tried not to seem too enthusiastic. "Good. Have him come up sometime and we'll introduce him to the library staff." Maureen was saved from replying to this sally by the appearance of the first patron of the day. The day passed more pleasantly than any Maureen could remember for months, and the purple fringed asters in the crystal vase presided in charming dignity over the subdued bustle of the library. Right after school, the three little Wilson children came in, somewhat unkempt and looking hungry, as usual. They came frequently, rather than to go home to an empty house. Maureen supposed that their working mother was doing the best she could for them, but today, of all days, she couldn't bear to see them looking so forlorn. She handed Madge a dollar and said, "Take those youngsters down to the corner and buy them hot chocolate and some doughnuts. Get some with thousands of calories. I'm sure they can use them." "I've warned you not to start this," said Madge. "You know that if you do, they'll be expecting to be fed every time they come in here. It's enough for you to give them a cookie now and then." "If I knew that they were actually hungry I'd plan to feed them every day and so would you—wouldn't you?" Madge shrugged. "I'm not so sure. Anyway, I'll help you do it this time. But don't think that I will carry on after you leave. I'm not a fairy godmother." Maureen smiled. "I know. You're the wicked witch. Run along and don't spend that dollar on a new broom." It was two days before Steve called, and Maureen had begun to think that the evening which had been such a delight to her had been more or less a routine evening of pleasure for him. Then the phone finally rang and a vibrant voice asked, "Did you ever try to set up a regional office for distributing appliances?" "Not lately," she replied. "I was afraid of that. Then you have no idea how muddled I've been." "I'll try to imagine." "Don't bother. You couldn't possibly. Anyway, I've earned a night out. Have you?" "I rather think so. I have checked out a few hundred books—mostly since four o'clock. Counted two dollars and twenty-nine cents in fines—mostly in pennies—and expelled two dogs from the library for undue noise." "That makes us just about even. Would you care to drive out to the Hilltop for dinner? I'm told the food is rather good. You haven't eaten as yet. I hope?" If Spring Be Late Maureen glanced at the salad she had just finished putting together and said, "No, I haven't." "Then I'll call for you in half an hour, if that is all right." "Quite," she agreed. She shoved the salad back into the refrigerator and dashed into the bedroom to change her dress. Salads didn't keep, but no matter. She was glad that she could say truthfully that she hadn't eaten. She put on a rather plain dinner dress and added some rhinestone earrings for a festive touch. As they started out, Steve said, "Let's skip the freeway and take the country road—unless you're starving, that is." "'m much more hungry for the scenery," she said. "It's lovely this close to the mountains. The leaves are already starting to turn, higher up." "That's one of the things I like best about Utah—the changing seasons. I was reared here, of course, but I've been on the West Coast now for over twenty years and I've always wanted to come back. I hope to take up skiing again. Do you ski?" "Yes, some. You're practically ostracized here if you don't. But I've just barely graduated from the so-called 'Bunny Slopes.'" "At that you're probably much better than I. We'll have a race and see." Maureen said nothing. He still didn't know that she planned to go away, and she couldn't help feeling a deep glow of satisfaction that he was apparently making plans to further their friendship. If only all of her bridges weren't burned! If something would happen to keep her home—for just a little while! If Miss Pine 258 April 1968 would say that she absolutely couldn't be replaced in the library. How absurd! Miss Pine had scarcely raised an eyebrow when she had resigned. Maybe there would be a bus strike. A lot of good that would do her, since there was still the railroad and the airlines for travel. They were among the early arrivals at the Hilltop and were directed to a choice location by a window, where they could see the distant lake. He gave their order and settled back with a contented smile. "By the way," he said, "the company is giving me a sort of welcome dinner two weeks from tonight. Will you be my guest?" "I would love to," she replied. "But two weeks from today I shall be on my way to Europe." "You will!" Steve exclaimed. "For very long?" "I'm not sure. I plan to do some genealogical research in London and—this sounds rather weird—but I'm joint heir to some sort of an estate in Scotland. The other one—a cousin in England—thinks that I should come and look it over." "Oh, an heiress! Will you marry me?" Maureen smiled. "I have no idea what it will amount to—if anything. Maybe just a bill for back taxes. Would you care to withdraw your intriguing proposal until I am sure?" "Under the circumstances—yes. Do you have to leave so soon? Are you flying?" "'m going by boat. I had planned to go east by bus in order to see the country." "Well, that you can certainly change. You can fly back and see 260 the country some other time. That will leave you free for the dinner." Maureen merely nodded. Her plans seemed to have been changed without her saying a word, and she had to agree that this was the better way. She hadn't even had to call a bus strike in order to get this much of a delay. She debated over whether or not to buy a new dress for the dinner and decided that she would. After all, she reminded herself, I may need one to wear in the castle. I may even be giving a dinner for the country gentry. It was so exciting to sit at the head table with the Guest of honor. To wear a white orchid on her royal blue dress. To have people express their pleasure at meeting her and genuinely seem to mean it. It was a memory that she knew she would treasure forever. On the day she was to leave, Steve drove her to the airport. As he pressed her hand in farewell he said, "Have fun."

Don't stay too long. And send me a postcard of Big Ben." "I promise all three," she smiled in reply. As the plane circled the valley, she looked down upon the lake, the Temple, and all of the beloved landmarks. They would all be there in the spring when she returned. But what of her friends? So much could happen in that time. So many changes could take place. In minutes, the plane was over the mountains. Maureen stopped looking downward. She looked up at her fellow passengers instead.

Editorial

Civility

A distinguished man remarked to a daughter upon the passing of her mother, "She was always a lady." The daughter confided that she had given much thought to his remark in the years since then. It had placed her beloved mother on a new plane to learn how she had been regarded by her peers. There still remain countless women who may be termed "ladies."

An important attribute of being a lady is to be gracious—gracious to everyone in all relationships. Often it may seem well-nigh impossible to be gracious. One is hurrying to an important assignment and ahead one catches a glimpse of an acquaintance who will, in all probability, detain one. A quick decision must be made as to how best to express graciousness and yet not be late for the appointment. Such a situation is graciously resolved by a lady.

Observation and experience, moreover, teach one that cordiality can invariably be expressed without delaying one's plans unduly. Some women always seem to have time to evidence interest in others. Other times one feels that the query, "How are you?" is purely perfunctory, and nothing is expected or wanted except the stereotyped reply, "Fine, thank you." A gracious woman evidences real interest and pursues the matter, without prying, until she really knows of the health of her friend. She is concerned about her.

Graciousness is particularly noted under conditions of stress. Even at busy times of the year some women are always welcoming and gracious, while others let it be known that a call is unwelcome. Visiting teachers who graciously visit in all types of weather and at personal sacrifice, certainly must make one call during the year which is inconvenient to the homemaker. The breeding of a woman is evident at such times, however, in the graciousness of her welcome.

It is especially important to be gracious where one holds a position of authority. It is essential that a woman be gracious with all with whom she works and sensitive to the feelings of others. Counterfeit graciousness is not acceptable. It is easily detected although a veneer of graciousness may coat the words. The spirit detects falsity.

Graciousness has roots in humility, sweetness, and consideration for others, in the realization that another's time is as important as one's own. In kindliness with resolve not to offend another, in being willing to give of one's time to another. One of the hardest times to remain gracious is when a lonely woman with no pressing duties herself, phones a busy mother or one who does have pressing duties, to help pass away the lonely minutes. Gracious, indeed, is the woman who can maintain graciousness over the years in such a relationship.

One husband, after the passing of his wife, who had wasted away through a long illness, declared that in his memory she never appeared as a sick woman, but he always saw her as she approached him at a reception held in their home, smiling in the beauty of her apparel and radiant with her gracious personality.

It may be helpful for one to imagine the image which she invokes in others, the picture which has been developed over the years, perhaps through everyday contacts or shutter-quick glimpses of varying moods. Graciousness is an attribute to be studiously nurtured and freely bestowed on others.

CANCER RESEARCH LENGTHENS LIFE
Fight Cancer With a Checkup and a Check
The American Cancer Society's policies, and its directors are all volunteer.
She was cured. 'That volunteer saved my life,'' she said.
Do you know the seven warning signals of cancer?
Unusual bleeding or discharge.
A lump or thickening in the breast or elsewhere.
A sore that does not heal.
Change in bowel or bladder habits.
Hoarseness or cough.
Indigestion or difficulty in swallowing.
A change in a wart or mole.

The risk of dying in the prime of life is more than twice as great for men who are heavy cigarette smokers as for men who are nonsmokers. Children love to imitate their parents. They learn by imitating them. Thousands of men and women are hiding from the facts of cigarette smoking.
Uterine cancer, common in women, can be detected by a pap test, and is almost 100 per cent curable, if found in time. In the field of leukemia, cancer of the blood-forming organs, research points the way to many promising leads.

About 45,000 Americans died of colon and rectum cancer last year. A large number of them could have been saved if they had regular physical examinations, including the "procto." Research for cancer detection, treatment, and cure is going forward in many directions and the accomplishments save many lives.

REVSHED Christie Lund Coles

Martha stood by the large window as long as her legs would hold her without feeling shaky. Then, she sank into one of the comfortable chairs in the lounge of the rest home, which faced the eastern mountains. It was a beautiful view, similar to that she had when she was home and could look from her front door and see the trees and the wide lawn with the mountains in the distance.

"There weren't many _trees here. These places hadn't been built long enough to have roots and old trees." Millie, the tall nurse, paused on her way down the hall to say, "My, Mrs. Brady, you really look nice today. Going to a party?" Martha smiled at her, not quite daring to trust her secret with her, not even sure that there was a secret. But, she couldn't resist saying, "No. I think I'll be going home."

Millie smiled indulgently, for most of the people here talked about going home constantly.

265
April 1968

She said, "What will we do without you around here? Who will feed Mrs. Redford? And you would miss the next chapter and the next of the book Emma Lou is reading to you." Martha merely smiled, still looking out of the window watching for Tess, her daughter, who had said she might have a surprise for her.

To herself, she thought, don't try to butter me up. I'm going home. Back to my own place. My own kitchen where I can putter around. You'll see.

She could hear the carts beginning to move down the halls with the noon meal on them. She could smell cooked meat and she thought, asparagus. She liked that. It wasn't likely they would have it here, though. Too expensive. It used to grow wild back at the end of her lot near the stream. Father used to pick it and bring it in, huge bunches of it.

The same with the field tomatoes that were pretty different from the ones you saw nowadays, red and ripe and luscious. Now, they called them beefsteak tomatoes and they cost a fortune. But Tess always told her to order whatever she wanted on the days she took her out to lunch. She was going to have steak (no ground meat today), and asparagus. And tomatoes.

After dinner—if they did go home—she would buy a cake and have some cool lemonade—with it. The excitement of the thought made her legs quiver as she stood up at the sight of Tess' car turning into the parking area. It was necessary for her to hold onto the back of a chair to get her balance before Tess got out to come in after her. She had thought she could make it on her own but was glad for the steadying hand of Rose, the nurse at the desk, who had seen her wobble and had come to assist her.

Yet, she met Tess at the door, smiling, straightening her good black straw hat. (What if it was ten years old? It was still good, and as near as she could tell, just about what they were wearing nowadays.)

Tess kissed her. "You're looking real perky, Mother. Where do you want to go for lunch?"

"My dear, you know more about that than I do. Just someplace real nice, because I want something special."

"Really? And what could that be? Caviar?"

"Nonsense. Salty old fish eggs. I want good old American steak, the kind your father used to raise and slaughter. Can you remember?"

"Yes. I can even remember when we were married and he divided one with us. You can't buy meat like that."

Martha was pleased. She beamed.

"Indeed you can't. And I want asparagus. And tomatoes."

"Tomatoes aren't on your diet."

"Guess just this once isn't going to hurt me. Now, let's go. They are already eating here."

As she settled into her seat, she mused pensively, "I guess Mrs. Redford will be wondering why I'm not there to feed her. But she will have to get used to it."

"What did you say?" Tess asked, her mind quite occupied with her driving.

"Oh nothing really. I'll tell you later." She would tell her after Tess had told her secret. She didn't know how she could wait, but she would manage. She wouldn't let her second daughter (LaVon was living in the East) know how excited she really was. She would go through all the motions of eating, enjoying her food. Then later they would buy the cake, they would go home. She would make the lemonade herself, cut the cake, serve it on her best heirloom plates that were still, she supposed, in the china cupboard in the dining room, just as she had left them.

But, it seemed, the darkhaired, dark-eyed girl was in no particular hurry to tell her. She kept up a running conversation. Finally, Martha could wait no longer. She put up her thin, slightly gnarled hand to silence her daughter in the midst of some silly bit of news and said, "I'm not interested in that. I'm interested in what else you're going to tell me. The good news."

"Good news?" The girl's eyes widened, just as they had done since she was a small child, questioning her, and wondering.

(Could it be possible that her daughter was past forty and had a daughter of her own married and settled in an apartment of her own?) "Pshaw. Surely, you know," her mother exclaimed, in irritation, "You told me last week you had a secret to tell me. Now, tell me. Tell me." Tess' eyes went blank for a moment as she repeated the Home Revisited word "Secret? I don't remember." Then, after a brief hesitation, she smiled, though not exactly as she would have smiled if she were playing a trick on her, and said, "Oh, yes. Jeanie didn't want me to tell you until she was sure. But, she is going to have a baby. In December. Isn't that wonderful? You will be a great-grandmother for the fourth time." Jeanie had been closer to her than any of her grandchildren and she knew she should have been happy, but she didn't feel anything except a great emptiness within her, as if she was falling. She gripped the table edge, asking, "You're sure that's all?" "Why, yes. What did you expect?" Martha didn't speak for a moment, then the words came out almost a sob, "I thought you were going to take me home. That you had made some arrangement that I could stay there." "But, Mother, we've gone over this so many times. You couldn't stay there alone. You can go home with me. You know you're welcome. But, when Pete has to go on one of his long trips I feel bound to go with him. We can't find anyone to stay with you. You know, we tried it before. [ thought you understood how it all is." Martha's lip quivered. "But I thought you were going to take me back to my own house, my own things." Suddenly, Tess stood up. Her square chin, like her father's, was resolute. She said, "All right, darling, let's drive out 267 April 1968 there. If you want to stay, I guess you may." The cake was in the seat between them, the lemon juice in a sack, when they drove up to the house that stood back from the road thirty or forty yards, surrounded by a hedge that had grown completely out of hand as had the grass. "What has happened here?" she asked, angrily, "Why isn't this place kept up?" "There just aren't any boys around here that want the work." "What about the Deardon boy and Jimmie down the street? He always used to come and help me." "Oh, Mother, they're grown up. Jim has gone away to school. Ted Deardon may even be married, I don't know. Times have changed." "Indeed they have. Look at that grass. And see that paint on the door, it's beginning to peel all over." "We were planning to have it fixed up this summer once you made up your mind to sell it." "Or... Decide to come back to it," her mother injected, quietly, "I told you, after I left your place that I would stay there six months and then, if I still felt pretty well and wanted to, I would come back. You children agreed." The younger woman sighed, "T suppose we did." "Well, come in and make yourself at home. I'm back now, and we'll soon have all of this fixed up." As Tess opened the door and they stepped through, an odor of great mustiness greeted their nostrils. 268 She cried, "Goodness, open a window. It smells like a vault in here... Or a tomb." Tess had a difficult time opening the window, finally having to go to the kitchen to find one that would give freely. "We really shouldn't open that one until the screen is fixed," Martha suggested, but they needed the air so that she let it go. As she removed her hat and jacket; she said, "Now, you sit down and let me fix you some lemonade and a piece of this angel food cake." "Let me help you," Tess suggested, moving toward the cupboard, in need of painting, too. But her mother protested, "No, you don't. You just sit down. This is my treat." She got her best plates from the top shelf, the cut glass, stemmed glasses that needed to be washed a bit before she could put the cold tap water in (from the old natural flowing well), and the canned lemon juice Tess had insisted that she buy instead of lemons... Because it was simpler. And by the time that the can was punched, the sugar measured (she wondered if sugar spoiled standing so long), the cake cut on the plates, she was amazed to find that she was a bit shaky. But, wasn't that natural, really? She had been used to being waited on too long, she needed to get her old legs going again. And she would! Just wait and see, she would, indeed. Tess said, "You look a little tired. Would you like to lie down on your bed for a little while? I have a little shopping to do and I could come back and get you. We could go to my place." "I'm not going to your place," Martha told her, emphatically, "I'm going to stay here. You can bring me something to cook. I won't need much, some bacon and eggs, bread. They never gave me enough bread." "You weren't supposed to" "Don't say I wasn't supposed to have it. At my age, what difference do a few pieces of bread make?" Tess started to say something about diabetic coma, but thought better of it, and arose smiling. "Well, [ll turn' the bedspread down. There's a blanket on the foot there if you need it over you. Ill bring the groceries. Anything else you want?" Martha enumerated a few things, surprised at the girl's easy compliance. 99 It was good to be in her own bedroom, see her own dresser, and the old chest and the table with its crocheted doily on it. It was cluttered now with things she had forbidden them to touch, but someday, she would have time to go through them all, sort things out. Right now, she was tired. She lay down, mentally scoffing at the idea of a blanket on such a warm spring day. Yet, it wasn't many moments till she was reaching for it. She had forgotten how cold this house was, and how dark this room. The shrubbery had grown even taller around the windows. It was musty and gloomy, and the silence that settled around her was almost frightening. There were no children playing outside as there had been before her eldest daughter had moved from the house next door. Home Revisited

She wouldn't worry about it now, though. She was going to nap, just as she did every day at the rest home, when the place had settled down in the afternoon quiet, except for the occasional cushioned step of one of the young and pretty nurses. She slept soundly until a noise at the front door invaded her dreamy half-consciousness. Her heart began to pound with inexplicable fear. She was barely conscious of her husband's picture on the wall; that of Lena—the daughter who had died. In fact, by the time Tess got in she was still waking from the sound sleep, waking with a start, wondering where she was and why it was so dark, instead of bright as noonday as it was at Foothill Manor. Then, she remembered, and a great wave of nostalgia swept over her at the sight of the familiar room—nostalgia for all the pleasant hours she had spent here. The years when the children were running in and out—her own, coming from fishing or bobsleigh parties, to a pot of hot soup and warm, new-baked bread, recently taken from the oven of the coal range (which still sat there in all its regal dignity, waiting for someone to fetch and carry the wood and coal and start the fire). She was a little afraid she wouldn't use the stove much next winter because who would fetch and carry the wood now? Not Father, not her two stalwart sons—married and moved away now, too—and not the grandchildren who had run in and out, and argued over which one should sleep there (that is, until toward the last when they were beginning to get older and were going out with their friends). No. There would be no one coming in now at all odd hours. Even Tess had had little time to spend with her when she had lived there, and would have much less now... Driving clear out here, Tess' cheery voice interrupted her thought. She came in with a rather small bag of groceries, set them down and said, "Does it seem good to be back? Will it be nice to be getting your own breakfast?" She remembered the first small stroke she had had. She had been getting breakfast that morning, when everything went black. But Reid had slept there and helped her to the bed and later had run to get his mother. Who would know if anything should happen to her now? Here alone? She sat on the edge of the bed. She said, "I guess I really should go back there tonight. Mrs. Redford always counts on me helping to feed her. She will wonder what has become of me. By the looks of things, this place needs quite a bit of fixing up. I guess even the gas for the stove and the front-room heater will have to be turned on. Won't they?" "Yes, they will. I don't want you wrestling with that coal range." "Oh, I could manage that for a day or two. I'm not as weak as you all make out." Then, before her daughter could answer, she hurried on, "But for the time being, maybe I'd better go back. You know that sweet Emma Lou who comes and reads to us is reading the best book. I can hardly wait to hear what's going to happen tomorrow." "Fine. Just fine, dear. Anything you say. You can go home with me to dinner tonight, then I'll take you back." "No-no. Your hubby just might bring somebody from the office, and anyway, Mrs. Redford sort of depends on me to help her eat. You don't mind, do you?" Her lovely daughter kissed her gently, "Anything you say, Madam." As they closed the door, Martha looked at the house for just a moment, wistfully. It was the same house and yet so different. Just as she was different. She had wanted to come home. But not to this strange, this empty, empty shell of rooms that she had seen today. All of them at the home thought and talked of nothing except wanting to go home, but the home they wanted to go to was a place of the long ago. A place that wasn't real any longer. A place out of the past. It was just as well it stayed there. In the past. And in happy memory.

The Seven C's Plus Contentment
Mabel Jones Gabbott

# I walked into my home at five p.m. I had been at the university since nine a.m., covering a conference for home economists. During one hour's lecture, I had become aware of the seven C's considered in planning a home: comfort, convenience, circulation, color harmony, charm, cost, and conversation pieces. Conversation pieces! Now that was what I had at home. There was the ironing board still set up where the college daughter had done a last-minute press job; a Scout's wet swimming suit on my hall table, and records, piled, scattered, and unsheathed all over the floor around the stereo. How charming!

I walked into the kitchen. Grease spattered the burners where the boys had cooked hamburgers for lunch. The overhead stove light blazed away—for how long I knew not. And at what cost! From the front door, through the living room and den to the back door, chocolate-colored footsteps added a new note to the color harmony of my rooms, and indicated clearly the route the circulation had taken. I followed the footsteps to my back patio. Conveniently, there was grandfather's rocker. I sank in comfort into it as I thought: I have a home with seven C's of home planning. What a lucky mother!

MY SONGS
I sang when I was happy,
My song was glad and free,
And one who heard my singing
Shared happiness with me.

I sang when I was burdened,
A tender, sweet refrain;
One who suffered found comfort
For his pain.

I sang when fears obsessed me,
New courage quelled my fear,
And a timid soul was strengthened
That did not know it was near.

Vangie Mae Blair = Louise Farmer leaned back in her chair and glared at her blanket-draped legs propped on the old footstool and felt sorry for herself. She knew it was stupid to feel that way. She was really very lucky, but that didn't seem to make any difference. This was the first time in her life she had been tied down. Even after the birth of each of her five children she had always been able to get up and do things. Not much, of course, but still.

She had never felt so physically trapped as she felt now. "All because of a silly little operation," she said to the vase of wilted daffodils on the table beside her. Oh, but it wasn't silly, she mentally reminded herself, with a sad shake of her gray head. An operation for her varicose veins had been necessary, important, and for her own good. The doctor had told her that over and over again.

"And now all you will have to do," he had said, "is to keep off your feet and give everything a chance to adjust." As if it was easy to keep off your feet and do nothing. That was the hardest thing in the world, just ask anyone who ever tried it! She looked around the room in disgust. There was a thin film of dust on her tables, television, and buffet. The rug by the door needed straightening, and all of the flowers were wilted and needed to be thrown away and fresh ones cut and arranged. It would be so easy, she thought, just to take fifteen minutes and fix it all up. But she had given her word to the doctor that she would follow, to the letter, his orders of extremely limited movement. All her life she had kept her promises. She was going to keep this one, even if it nearly killed her to do it. What really topped it off, she thought to herself with a vengeance, was that today was the Sabbath and she couldn't go to her meetings. The benches in the chapel were too hard and much too close together to let her use a footstool to keep her feet up. Oh, she could go and sit on the benches sideways and put her legs up along the bench, but she wasn't going to make a public spectacle of herself at her age. A squeak and a bang of the front gate caused her to turn and look out of the window. Bobby Johnson was coming up the path, and with the exactness of childhood, he was very carefully stepping only in the center of each and every flagstone. He jumped up onto the wooden porch and knocked on her door. "Come in," she called out. "Hello, Sister Farmer, how are you today?" he said further wrinkling the rug as he twisted around and firmly shut the door behind him. "Fine, Bobby," she answered as she watched him walk over to the large, pink wing chair across from her. One of his shoelaces had come untied, and it dragged along the beige linoleum each time he put that foot down. He perched himself on the edge of the chair and looked at her. A large grin lit up his face and wrinkled his freckled nose. In the glow of such a cute, all-out smile, Louise felt herself smiling back at him. Bobby is certainly pleased with himself about something, Louise thought, so she asked, "What brings you here? Did your mother send you over for something?" "No," Bobby said and started to swing his crossed feet back and forth. His loose shoelace danced enthusiastically on every down swing. Bobby looked down at his erring lace and bent forward almost double to tie it. His bottom hung precariously on the edge of the chair, and Louise felt that any minute he would lose whatever balance he had and she would see him fall, smack, onto the top of his blonde head. He didn't fall, and she sighed with relief as he straightened up, red-faced from his task. "I went to Sunday School this morning, and my teacher told us some things that Jesus told us to do on Sunday and one was to visit the sick and afflict them, so here I am." After announcing his good works to her, he wiggled back into the large chair, folded his arms, and smiled complacently at her. Louise smothered a smile with difficulty and said, "Thank you." "You're welcome." Louise was at a loss. Just how does one talk to a small boy who comes to visit the sick and afflict them? 273 April 1968 From the depths of the chair Bobby looked around the room for a moment and then announced, "Your flowers are dead." "Yes, Bobby, I know. They need to be thrown out and fresh ones put in their place." "I'll do it," Bobby said as he hopped out of the chair and picked up the vase of daffodils from the table beside her and started towards the bouquets on the television and the buffet. Louise pushed herself forward from the chair and started to protest, when Bobby added, "Jesus said that we're supposed to help people." She sank back into her chair again. She was plainly in the hands of a doer of good works. After all, things are only things, but people, especially children, are special. Bobby tucked the vase of daffodils in the crook of his left elbow and hugged a vase of wilted flowers to his chest with his left hand. With his right hand he picked up the vase of hothouse flowers her daughter had left when she had come to clean house and visit last Monday. Somehow, Bobby made it across the floor and into the kitchen with only one tiny spill on the floor. She heard him dump the water into the sink and pull the flowers out of the vases. He opened the back door and she heard a rattling thump as the old flowers hit the garbage can. After the back door was shut again, there was silence for a space and then a small voice said, "I dripped, where's the mop?" "Standing up at the side of the house behind the garbage can." "Oh," he said, as the back door opened and then shut again. Louise smiled as she heard the scratchy sound of a dry mop on the kitchen floor. She had always admired Brother and Sister Johnson for the way they were rearing their family, now she admired them even more. There aren't too many little boys who would try to clean up their messes. "There was a pause in the mopping and a drawer was pulled open. From the sound of the various crashes and clinks, Bobby had pulled out the utensil drawer. He went out the back door, dragging the mop behind him and firmly shut the door. In the house all was quiet. Too quiet, Louise thought, as she strained to hear what was going on outside. After what seemed a very long time, Bobby came in at the back door again. Faintly, the smell of lilacs drifted into the front room. Why, she didn't know the lilacs were blooming! They grew around on the other side of the garage, and she hadn't been able to walk there to see them. She thought, if it weren't for Bobby I would have missed the lilacs this year. Louise heard the splashing of tap water in the sink as Bobby filled the vases. She suddenly thought of something. "Bobby!" "What?" he called as he poked his head through the doorway. The water was still running in the sink. "Could you please put some plates under the vases so the water won't stain the woodwork?" "Okay," he said, and disappeared. Louise leaned back in her chair and listened to the small, friendly noises coming from the kitchen.

Sometime later, Bobby came in with three plates and put one each on the television, the buffet, and the table by her chair. When he came into the front room again his slow steps proclaimed that he was carrying the flowers. This first vase he carefully placed on the television. He stepped back with satisfaction and skipped back into the kitchen. Louise smiled. The lilacs in the vase looked as if they had been exploded into their present positions. They hung outward and down at alarming angles. Not one of them stood up the least little bit. The stems were too long, and a few of them stayed in only because they had caught on the inside of the sharply curved neck of the vase.

'It was a pottery vase that her oldest daughter had made in a college ceramics class, and for the first time, Louise was glad that it was as heavy as lead. The second vase of flowers Bobby brought in was filled with what she figured were the remaining blooms of her early bulb garden. Miraculously, all of them were standing straight up in the small, white milk-glass vase. When she complimented Bobby on getting them to stay all together so tall, he smiled and said, "I wrapped them together with toilet paper." To visit the sick before I put them in the vase. See!" He lifted them up. There was a mass of white sogginess gluing the stems together.

Louise looked from the flowers to Bobby's proudly smiling face. "That's nice," managed to say. Satisfied, Bobby put the flowers down and went back for the last vase whose arrangement could be called 'various.' Bobby had picked a few of every type of flower he could find, and some weren't even flowers! There were small yellow flowers from the ditchbank. Their poor little stems were so short that he had balanced their blooms on the edge of the vase, like children hanging their chins over the backs of chairs. A few early blooms, with most of their petals shaken off, stood tall and bare in the center. There were some field daisies and some purple ones that were definitely weeds. Standing aloof in the bunch was a rosebud. Bobby pointed to it proudly and said, "I got that one from my Daddy's bush."

"Bobby, they are all lovely. Thank you very much," she said softly. The little boy walked carefully back over to the wing chair and sat down. He looked at Louise's legs and asked her, "Do they hurt?"

"No, Bobby, not really." There was silence for a while.

"Would you like a peanut butter sandwich? I make them good."

"No, thank you."

"You don't have to worry about the bread knife being dirty. I washed all the flower juice off of it and dried it real nice. I can cut bread in slices, too. Sometimes they fall into crumby pieces, but most of the time I can cut bread into whole slices. Let me fix you a big fat peanut butter sandwich, okay?"

"IT wish you could, Bobby, but the doctor said I'm not supposed to eat things like that until I can get up and walk around." Louise looked at Bobby's face slowly losing its sunshine smile, so she softly added, "But if you like, you can get me an apple from the refrigerator. You may have one, too."

"I'll get one for you," he said, "but I can't have one because I'm visiting you."

Louise was so busy watching Bobby walking proudly into the kitchen to 'help' her that the knock on the front door startled her.

"Come in," she called.

Sister Johnson came in.

"Is Bobby still here? He said he was coming over to visit you, but that was quite a while ago and I don't want him to tire you out."

"Oh, no, Bobby's not tiring me out. He has been helping me." Louise gestured with her hand to indicate the new flower arrangements.

Sister Johnson smiled and walked over to the television to balance the lilacs better in their vase. As she turned and poked the flowers, they assumed a more traditional look.

"Yes, he is a big help at times, isn't he?" she asked half smiling.

In the kitchen the water tap was turned on and the splashing sounds meant Bobby was dutifully washing the apple before bringing it in. The two women looked at each other with understanding.

"Sister Farmer, would you like to go to church with us this evening?"

"I'd love to go. I miss not going to my meetings, but I just can't sit that long on those benches."

"T've got that all figured out," said Sister Johnson. "We can put all of the children in the very back of our station wagon, and you can sit sideways on the seat going there. When we get there, you can use our aluminum chaise lounge, you know, the folding one with green webbing that we bought last summer."

Louise Farmer looked around her front room and thought how nice it would be to get out of the house. She had so missed partaking of the sacrament.

"If I could sit at the very back," she said, "I will go with you. Thank you so very much for asking me."

Bobby came out of the kitchen with a bright apple in his hand.

"Hello, Mother. Did you come visiting the sick, too?" he asked.

"That's part of it," Sister Johnson said, smiling, "but mostly I came to get my visiting boy."

"Did I visit you all right?" Bobby asked Louise.

"Yes, Bobby, you visited me just fine. I'm glad you came." She held out her hand and Bobby took it, "and please come again."

"I will," said Bobby, as he went out the door.

To Visit the Sick

"We'll be by to pick you up fifteen minutes before church," said Sister Johnson, as she closed the door.

Louise looked over her now silent house and smiled at her new flowers. Somehow, the dust on things didn't look quite so bad. The water spot on the floor was slowly drying to a dull uneven shadow, but her daughter would clean that up when she came to clean tomorrow.

Let's see, she thought, to herself, what can I wear to church? Then she smiled at herself, because she realized that when a woman starts wondering what she can wear, she is well on the road to recovery.

C.E.E.F.S.O. BE GLAD TODAY

Smile the miles of child-chatter days;
Too soon they pass, and open rooms
Resound with quiet echoings;
Halls grow more hollow, void of running feet;
Walls prattle loneliness where laughter played.
Be glad today is boisterous and sweet.

This annual report reflects the activities and achievements of Relief Society during 1967—the first eight months of 1967, beginning January 1 and ending August 31. The 1968 report will cover the period September 1, 1967—August 31, 1968, which will be in keeping with the new fiscal year for Church organizations.

Report

While the change from a calendar to a fiscal year does not lend itself to a comparison of the activities during 1967 with those of 1966, we do note a gratifying increase in the number of organizations as well as in the various activities conducted by the local Societies. A total of 434 stakes and 74 missions submitted annual reports which represented the activities that were carried on in 4,046 ward and branch organizations within the stakes and 2,006 branches within the missions during the eight-month period. In 1967 new stakes were organized in Guatemala City, Guatemala; Mexico City, Mexico; Sydney, Australia, and in many parts of the United States. Relief Society organizations are now functioning in 57 countries and in 50 states of the United States. Up to August 31, 1967 there were 298,825 women who availed themselves of the opportunity of membership in Relief Society which was organized by the Prophet Joseph Smith 126 years ago for the spiritual and cultural development of the women of the Church and for the blessing of Church members. Two thousand, eight hundred and eleven Relief Society members were not members of the Church but realized within Relief Society opportunities for developing their talents and skills. Leadership opportunities were extended to 197,960 Relief Society members, who officered the various stake, mission, mission-district, ward and branch organizations throughout the Church. Of this number 29,322 executive officers directed the activities of the respective Societies, 12,227 served as choristers, organists, and magazine representatives, 24,518 class leaders gave untiringly of their time and talents in their respective assignments, and 131,893 visiting teachers visited monthly the 591,200 families within the Church listed for visiting by the visiting teachers. In addition to this number, there were 9,531 non-Latter-day Saint families visited. A total of 3,286,374 visits were made to these families by the faithful visiting teachers who carried spiritual messages to the mothers in the homes. Ward and branch magazine representatives were successful in extending the blessings of the Relief Society Magazine, printed in English, to 259,638 homes and the Spanish Magazine to 5,868 homes of our Spanish-speaking sisters. There were 183,645 meetings held in wards and branches where the members received instructions in the doctrines of the Church, homemaking skills, as well as in developing better family relations and a greater appreciation for the best in art, music, and literature. Participation in the music program of Relief Society brought increased testimonies, cultural development, and happiness to 52,329 sisters who comprised the 3,739 Singing Mothers choruses organized in the wards and branches of the Church. These blessings were shared with members of their families as well as those who listened to their beautiful music in stake conferences, concerts, and other special activities. Relief Society women, under the direction of the priesthood, assisted in caring for the unfortunate through the Church Welfare Program. Relief Society presidents visited 67,569 families to determine their needs and made 61,718 other contacts with these families; 505,199 hours were contributed by female members of the Church on welfare projects, such as sewing needed clothing, and in canning food. We are grateful that the important service of ministering to the sick and homebound, the comforting of the sorrowing, continues to be carried on in a spirit of sisterly love and concern. Under the direction of the Relief Society presidents, 24,373 eight-hour days were spent in caring for the sick, 284,706 visits were made to the sick and the homebound, and 550,697 hours were devoted to other compassionate services, such as caring for the children of a sick mother, preparing a hot meal for an aged sister or accompanying one to a doctor's office, as well as other types of needed assistance. Relief Society also rendered comforting service at 7,386 funerals and 611 bodies were dressed for burial by members of Relief Society. The homemaking meetings attracted an average of 120,357 sisters each month, who not only developed their own talents and skills, but who assisted in the completion of 662,618 articles; 387,870 of these were sewed articles consisting of quilts, clothing, household furnishings; and 274,748 were articles of other types of handiwork. New and better ways of performing homemaking tasks and better methods in home management were also a part of the homemaking activities. The inspired program of Relief Society, designed to help all Latter-day Saint women as well as non-members who participate in the varied activities to become better wives, mothers, homemakers, and members of the Church, continues to accomplish the purposes for which Relief Society was organized by the Prophet Joseph Smith.

287 SO | LIKE PINK CLOUDS! Do not condemn my rose-hued glasses, for they enable me to see the action of life's lads and lasses with tolerance and sympathy. They do not dull my common sense; I still know facts, and wrong from right 'tis only that, thanks to their lens I see life in a different light | see the same things others do� but through a rainbow prism adjusted for my special view, which, | guess, is optimism.

Ka __ Don Knight

Significant Day Annie C. Esplin The smell of frying homemade sausage teased my nostrils. Drowsily, I turned in bed, catching a glimpse of light peeking through the bedroom door. An impact of shivery anticipation assailed me as I became fully aware of the importance of the dawning day. We were going with our father to take the grist to the mill—a journey five miles up the valley, with an added five miles back home to prolong the yearly adventure. My two younger sisters awakened. Hopping out of bed, our actions assumed a definite purpose. We donned calico sack aprons, with matching sunbonnets starched to a prim stiffness; hoping that there would be no delay of departure. Mother opened the door to the magic of her cozy kitchen. The coal-oil lamp glowed over the breakfast table, which was spread with a snowy cover. Chairs were placed, with high backs to the table, ready for morning prayers. Father emerged from outside with a bucket of foamy milk in one hand and a lantern in the other. Sensing our eagerness, he smiled with satisfaction, loving an opportunity to gladden our hearts. The sun glazed at us inspiringly from the top of White Mountain, as the team obligingly pulled the wagon and us up the lane to begin the trip. We all settled happily in the spring seat. The wagon box creaked, adjusting itself to hold sacks of wheat, while wheels turned in accompaniment to steady clip-clop of horses' hooves. The road meandered enticingly, rewarding us with surprises of nature at her best—busy, small folk of the animal kingdom, ducks in the creek, red and gold autumn leaves on a hillside lookout. Going down a steep bank, splashing through the creek, we came face to face with a huge structure which was the grist mill. As we climbed out of the wagon, we could hear it groan and shudder as the bulky machinery performed to its utmost capacity. A genial miller, powdered with flour dust, greeted us. He and Father were forced to shout to each other. Our wheat was unloaded, and by thorough process, turned from golden grain into white flour. Going home in tranquil Indian summer twilight, our childish voices accompanied Father's fine tenor in a rendition of "Love at Home." Singing of home reminded me of our brand new phonograph, with elegant morning-glory horn, which was at the very moment resplendent on the center table in the parlor. At night, in our comfortable bed with a fresh outdoor aroma of the corn shuck tick, my thoughts turned to the precious sacks of flour stored with our winter supply of food; abundant granary and barn. Wise, industrious Father and Mother! I felt secure—aware of the fact "all is well." As I sank into untroubled slumber, a singing happiness was in my heart. Peace and quiet reigned in our valley home.

289 The Sky Is Blue Again Sylvia Probst Young On a day in late autumn, when the clouds hung oppressively low and a mournful wind cried through the bare, brown trees, I closed my door and walked hurriedly across the field to the home of a friend. My thoughts, as I walked along, were dark as the day. I was lonely, disappointed, sick at heart, feeling that life had hurt me more than I could bear. Nothing seemed really worthwhile anymore. I needed to talk to someone—I wanted sympathy, and so I went to her—a woman who is my friend. She was in her little garden behind the house, digging some carrots for the soup she was making. "It's the kind of a day for good, homemade vegetable soup," she exclaimed, after greeting me warmly. "Come in, I have a nice fire, and we can talk." I apologized for coming so unexpectedly, but she quickly corrected me, "Friends don't need previous appointments; it's a compliment to have you come whenever you will."

Sitting on her worn divan, I talked, and she listened, sitting close beside me, her eyes deep with feeling and understanding. She heard my bitterness and heartache, shared my tears. Her hand, rough from work and knotted by arthritis, lay gently on mine. I felt the strength of her, the comfort she gave without saying a word—she who had known so much of sorrow herself.

When the soup was done, she brought it in on a tray, with homemade bread and apricot marmalade, and I thought it was the best lunch I had ever had. Too quickly the hour passed, and it was time for me to go. I didn't want to, but I knew that I must. At the door, I put an arm around her. "Thank you," I said simply.

"Feel so much better now," I added. "Could you possibly know how much you have helped me?" "Don't know why," she said, "I never seem to know what to say, all I can do is to listen and try to understand." Then she raised her eyes upward.

"Oh, look!" she exclaimed brightly, "the sky is blue again, tomorrow will be a better day." Looking up, I saw that she was right, a big patch of blue was pushing the clouds away, and a ray of sunlight gleamed down. Walking back home with a new perspective, I thought how infinitely wise she was without knowing it. "I just listen and try to understand," she had said, but oh, the strength she gave in the listening! For to listen is the highest compliment one can give another—to listen and to understand. How rare and precious is a listener. Her words at parting had given me much to think about—"The sky is blue again." Certainly all things pass away—sorrow, just as cloudy skies, cannot last indefinitely. "Tomorrow will be a better day." Yes, tomorrow would be a better day because of the selflessness—the charity, of a wonderful friend.

In the Old Hollow

Those were our green years of learning for, there, in our Hollow, we watched spring bring her new blooms, summer lend her sun-warm support, autumn color the landscape as lazy leaves fell on fantasy land. Willows became our mending walls, our maneless ponies, our weapons. Flowers were our growing children, their buds grew, their petals fell, some were born weak, others survived through summer. We became nature's children as we danced in her dawn, ate of her berries, drank from her waters and sang with her wind. We vowed to return to our world within a world within a world.

Yet I forgot, and became as a beggar, too hungry to taste the richness of a feast. These have been my lean years.

Betty Gardner Ackerlind

And A Bag To Match

Shirley Thulin

Every little girl loves Mommy's purse, so surprise her with a bag of her very own. This project is so easy, you may want to make several, one to match each new dress you make for her. The bag should be made of faille or a similar fabric. If the child's new dress is of a thinner material, line it with faille or heavy satin, and treat the lining and the matching dress fabric as one piece of material. Bonded lace also makes a beautiful bag.

First, cut two circles of fabric 15 inches in diameter. Pin the two sections together, right sides facing. (If you are lining the bag you will have four circles. Be sure to pin the four together so that the right sides of the dress fabric will be together.) Stitch all around 4 inches from the edge, leaving an opening of 3 inches, as shown in figure 1. Now trim the seam allowance to 1/2 inch, turn the right side out, and slip stitch the opening together.

Now, with a fine needle (so that it will not leave holes in the fabric) baste all around the edge, pulling out the seam so that the circle will be nice and round. Now press and remove the bastings.

Second, on the wrong side, mark a circle 1/4 inch from the edge. Now mark another circle 1/2 inch from this circle. Stitch around both of these marked circles. This forms a casing. Make two buttonholes one inch apart on each side (figure 2). Be sure to make the buttonholes through the casing only, and not clear through to the right side. Thus, from the right side, the buttonholes will not show.

Third, make two drawstrings, each 4 yards long. These can be made of white shoelaces, rug yarn, or ribbon. To insert the drawstrings, fasten a safety pin to the end of one drawstring. Pass through one buttonhole in the casing, work around, passing in and out of both buttonholes on opposite side. Bring string out of second buttonhole of first side (figure 3). Join the ends by knotting the drawstring.

Fasten a safety pin to the second drawstring; insert in the buttonhole on the opposite side and thread clear around just like the first drawstring. Now turn to right side and the bag is finished.

Pigeons at Dawn

The morning wakes to pigeons. Their mingled cries suffuse
The chill of paling starlight
With ardent sunrise hues.
Dawn is their tumbled music
As morning moments bring
The rosy voice of pigeons,
Calling and answering.

Mama's Dish Cupboard  
Joy Lamoreaux  

Fret # There is in a simple household task an occasional wafting, as of spring into summer, of a lovely memory. Such is my remembrance of a Saturday, when Mama, finishing her toast and honey, rose from the table in quite her ordinary way, saying "Hurry and finish breakfast, girls, because this morning we must get at that dish cupboard." But cleaning Mama's dish cupboard was anything but ordinary. It was an adventure; it summoned all the warmth and glow of a girl's delight, like new patent leather shoes for the Fourth of July, or standing barefoot at the hearth on Christmas Eve.

Mama, though, would pull a chair to the kitchen cabinet as though she did that every day, and the cleaning of her cupboard began. Each of us had our special "dish," and as Mama handed dusty favorites to her girls, we heard again the promises: when we were grown, they would be ours to keep; we would have ideal husbands and lovely china cupboards, with this exquisite glass behind the panes.

And as each piece descended, Mama, too, became enchanted, and told nostalgic tales for every one. "That cup came all the way across the plains in great-grandma's wagon box," she would say, And we imagined the lady in homespun skirts, wrapping cut glass in linen and protecting it across plains and mountains, while her own hands grew red and rough. And we knew how tenderly she unwrapped it, and how fondly it was placed in the old west home, a delicate radiance beside log walls.

And we could see Mama, laughing, vivacious, with crumpled tissue about her knees in her own first home, and daddy smiling at her beauty. For "that was a present on our own wedding day." There was the tiny tea service with tiny cups that one plump mulberry would fill on summer mornings under the mulberry tree; and the baby plate and cup that had been glued many times since six rosy mouths had learned to drink from it.

So carefully, so gently, we washed and polished every shimmering piece, and each was seen as through a mist, and brought a flood of questions, and romantic answers. Answers that would live for us when, in the distant years, mama would be gone, and we would hear her laughter floating from the shelves of our own cupboards, cleaning them.

Our own cupboards—those would embrace the dear fragilities that had been Mama's. Cupboards that would need scrubbing, but would never seem a task to scrub, that would welcome soap and keep the secret of remembering tears.

Cleaning Mama's dish cupboard was the glory of a Saturday morning—and more. For the memory of those mornings would, with marriage and children, bring a gentle realization of the timelessness of woman's spirit, of the enduring tenderness of ordinary women who had loved and been loved, and who treasured crystal symbols of that love.

And just as Mama's girl had stood enthralled at the tale behind a glistening teacup, just as Mama had known the enchantment of her mother's cupboard, so our daughters would one day ask, "And where did you get this dish, Mama?"

"Ie le Time to Get in the Chips"  
Zara Sabin  

Today, as I was preparing kindling for the fireplace, my thoughts went to a time long past when a little boy sang gaily, "It is five o'clock, it is six o'clock, it is time to get in the chips.... It is five o'clock, it is six o'clock, it is time to get in the chips." The chips were from logs the older brothers or father sawed or chopped and split for use throughout the house for its warming or the cooking of meals. Again, I saw the kitchen range, its black top gleaming almost as brightly as its silver-hued ornaments; smelled the oven-fresh bread, pies, and cakes; heard the popping of corn in the big three-footed iron kettle.

Prayers of the kneeling group, which surrounded the table night and morning, giving thanks for blessings and asking guidance and protection in speech and act, rang in my ears and heart. The laughter and gaiety, banter, and jokes of a family who loved life and each other, sang around the parlor organ, worked together in the house or field, which included a carefree boy who could make his own song, are memories beyond price, such as belong to many an older generation.

"It is five o'clock, it is six o'clock, it is time to get in the chips."

297

The Interval  
I long for an interval now and then, With no one demanding my presence, when The tasks of the day are complete and done, No heed of tomorrow, no care, not one.

Close the shutters tight, let the darkness keep An Interval quiet as childhood sleep: But a child no longer, what drone am I That others should shield as the days go by? Fling the shutters wide, let the daylight in, What matters age? It is time to begin To do what I can, when I can, and how; Tomorrow abides, but today is now. 

Bertha A. Kleinman

CE Gary Rannsor 298 =� The old Saipanese woman had told her son she had a big secret. But, like a child, she was anxious to share that secret with someone who could really appreciate its full impact. And now she had found that someone—Nancy.

"The old woman wants to show you something," the man said, "in the boonies. Come." Nancy obediently followed them onto a path which appeared from out of nowhere. Inadvertently, she crunched snail shells beneath her feet and ducked under giant spider webs as she was led deeper and deeper into the tangantangan. Then the foliage dropped suddenly from roof-top to knee-high, and the jungle became a quiet forest sprouting row upon row of white, weathered grave markers.

Chapter 8 (Conclusion) Throw Down the Gauntlet Janet W. Breeze

"Garapan City," the man said, "come." Here and there, bright plastic flowers hung in wreaths from markers where each plot beneath was carefully sectioned off with stones and covered with white sand. Through the sand, small shoots of tangantangan defiantly poked their wispy heads. In once neat garden sectors, crowds of bowstring hemp stood cobwebbed and erect with tropical stature. Green bamboo the size of maple trunks quaked and creaked in the overhead breezes as Nancy's eyes focused from Chamarro, to Spanish, to German, to Japanese markers and back again.

And then it was obvious they were once more out of the cemetery—and here, beneath two ancient mango trees 299 April 1968—they stopped, as the old woman began to point to an unmarked plot surrounded by small stones and almost hidden by weeds. "She says," the son slowly translated, "many years ago a small airplane fell from the sky—in the lagoon—Tanapag. A lady like you—with short hair—came out of the water. She was wearing man's pants. Americano ladies saw soldiers make secret. Get ready for war. Old woman saw soldiers hide the lady. Then the lady died. Old woman saw them put her in the ground."

"Amelia Earhart?" Nancy whispered, half to herself. "Here on Saipan?"

Nancy stood staring at the potter's field grave, trying to remember what she had read in school about the woman who vanished while attempting to fly around the world in the late 1930s. "Maila," the old woman said, pointing at the darkening clouds overhead. "Come," her son repeated. "We go now. Rain."

The three of them turned and retraced their steps back through the cemetery. Now the lazy breezes were gaining momentum and the tall bamboo shoots made long, slow, cracking sounds as they leaned first to one side, and then to the other—each stalk now and again rubbing its neighbor with screeching vibrato.

Where was that? Nancy thought. She vanished east of here—way east. How could she have made it to Saipan?

As they stepped once more into the clearing of the little "boonie" farm, a nervous sort of 300 activity brought people running up to them and speaking in soft, urgent tones.

"You must hurry," the man said to Nancy. "KJQR says typhoon coming."

Nancy looked around at the group of frightened faces—and at the thrown together shack of patchwork plywood resting upon eight cement-block "feet."

"But you'd better come with me," she said. "We have a concrete home. There would be plenty of room."

The man grinned and shook his head. "No, Missus."

"But where will you go?" Nancy asked.

"To cave."

The old woman began waving her hands excitedly toward Nancy. "Lagusi! Lagusi!"

"Hurry, Missus." Nancy quickly climbed into her small, Japanese-made car and turned on the radio, but the daily Armed Forces broadcast of pure "country" music from Nashville was not interrupted by any local news.

Maybe there had been a misunderstanding. Well—it had been known to happen!

It looked like any other rainy day in any other part of the world to her, but as she drove up to the side of their newly acquired "permanent" quarters, Grant was standing in the doorway waiting for her.

"Give me the keys," he said, "so I can park it around the front of the house. They're expecting a typhoon to hit here in forty-eight hours."

Nancy still felt a bit stunned and confused. "So then what's the rush?" she asked, "if it's not until day after tomorrow?"

"We've got plenty to keep us busy inside," Grant said, "come on. Mortensens dropped by to make sure I had heard the broadcast, and they said we should get everything we can, put away and into the closets."

Grant's tone of immediacy distressed Nancy. In one year of living in the tropics, she had heard so much talk about typhoons—and false warnings—that she could not immediately comprehend that it could actually happen.

And she wanted to talk about something else, about where she had been in the boonies.

"T've already checked our food supply," Grant said. "There's plenty of canned meat and fruit juice to see us through it."

"Good," Nancy said, still preoccupied and looking for the encyclopedia volume marked "E."

"Honey!" Grant said, "we have to get the books put into the closet—not take them out!"

"Oh, Grant, sit down! Calm down! Just give me ten minutes to settle my mind on something and then I'll panic! If KJQR can take time to play country music, I can take time to look something up."

"Isn't this kind of a switch from our first night on Truk when we caught the tail end of that tropical storm and you all but Aid in the closet?" "Please! Don't remind me!" And she flipped through the pages of her books.

"That's what I thought," she said, "Howland Island. It isn't anywhere near here."

"Well, of course it's not," Throw Down the Gauntlet Grant said. "But why does that matter right now?"

"Nancy—every island in the Pacific has a legend of Amelia Earhart. No one knows—and so everyone speculates."

"But this old woman told the story in such detail! She is so positive! And she described her perfectly. Now how could she make a thing like that up?" "I don't know," Grant said, "Maybe she saw it in the movies." "Well, maybe it's true, and maybe it isn't," Nancy went on, "but as I stood looking at that grave, what had only been a story before suddenly came alive! And I couldn't help but think what a brave woman she must have been in the first place to even attempt a flight like that—especially after going over the Pacific myself."

I don't think I'd ever want to cross any way but by jet—get it over with in a hurry." Nancy closed the book and returned it to the hot closet. "Anyway—I stood there in the boonies, and I just wanted to cry. She seemed so real. The people of Garapan who are no more seemed so real. I even thought about our pioneer ancestors. Oh, Grant. We've had our disappointments and times of sorrow—but nothing could ever compare with the trials 301 April 1968 some people are forced to live through—and die through. I'm so glad we came out here. It has given me such a greater compassion toward other people and their ways and their problems. I used to think I had a testimony of the gospel—but it was nothing compared to the feeling I have now. When I look at other people, I just can't comprehend what I ever could have done to be so blessed!" Grant smiled at her in his usual studious way. "You're right," he said, "and I hate to dampen your mood—but let's remember that the Lord helps those who help themselves, so let's carry these couch cushions into the bedroom closet." "Do you suppose it will be a bad typhoon?" she asked. "Who knows? I guess that depends on whether it's a direct hit, or we just get the effects of its hitting someplace else. We shouldn't have too much to worry about, though, in a concrete house. But we should get everything we can put away—not that it's going to stay. Perfectly dry. I've heard people say the wind from a typhoon can send rain through four inches of concrete." "Don't you think that sounds a little farfetched?" Nancy asked. "T don't know. I've never been in a typhoon—yet." When Nancy had first heard that the warning was for a storm forty-eight hours away, it seemed as if they would have time on their hands to do nothing but wait, but in making preparations for the storm and taking care of their four children, the hours seemed to slip by all 302 too quickly. Now the sky was clouded in a frightening green as rain drizzled down the windowpanes. "We'd better tie down the sunshades," Grant said. "It'll keep any broken glass from flying around the room." "Here, Amy," Nancy said, "take this stack of picture books to the nursery. We're going to stay in there for awhile, and you'll want lots to do." Amy held out her arms for the books and started to cry at the same time. "T'm scared." "Oh, come on now," Nancy said, "what's there to be afraid of?" "It looks funny outside." "Well, we're going to have a new experience, honey, but before we do, we'll have our family prayer. And then everything will be all right!" Now the increasing velocity of the wind began driving the rain with such force that it came through the lanai screens and then into the living room. Nancy looked at the electric clock. "Power's off." '"Let's get into the bedroom," Grant said. "Shouldn't we make some kind of attempt to start mopping this water?" Nancy asked. "Forget it. Just take your shoes off. You'd be fighting a losing battle." Skipper happily obeyed his father's suggestion and began sloshing around on the floor, but Amy's understanding was closer to being comprehensible and once more she started to cry—this time softly, while she clung to her mother's dress as they walked down the hall to the bedroom. Nancy remembered her own preschool fear of the wind and how her mother used to comfort her "little ballerina" by getting her to watch how the wind made the curtains and shadows "dance so beautifully." Such a long time ago, Nancy thought, so long ago.

Throw Down the Gauntlet

Now she squared her shoulders as her mind played back the words of the prayer Grant had just offered and the testimony which had increased so powerfully during the time on Saipan. Her family depended upon her for strength; and, for the first time in her life, she felt as if she could give it. She would not fail them.

Grant lighted a kerosene lamp and when he handed it to Nancy, his palms were cold and moist. "Well, you know what?" Nancy made a point of saying cheerfully, "Amy only cries for one reason—she's hungry!" Then Nancy looked across the room where Skipper and Grant were seated by the twin cribs. "So Daddy, you throw down the gauntlet—and I'll prepare the food."

"Our stake is unique in that it is comprised exclusively of married students and their wives and children. Many of the sisters are helping to put their husbands through school. Relief Society bazaars are invaluable, not only for the opportunity they offer to develop homemaking skills, but also for helping the sisters to keep within their tight budgets. "Each of the six wards in the stake held bazaars. We are grateful that so many of the activities and phases of Relief Society are carried out in the unique university situation." Norwegian Mission Holds All-Mission Relief Society Conference October 7-8, 1967 Rose M.

"The conference was held in Oslo, and members there graciously opened their homes so that there was no expense for the visitors after travel. In Norway, distances are great and the terrain is difficult to travel. The sisters had been saving for this event for several months. A rummage sale was held early in the year to help defray the expenses of the conference. In addition, each branch brought items to be sold at the conference, and the proceeds were used to help sisters who had traveled long distances. "Saturday evening a program for all Church membership was held, at which time a play, 'Melinda,' was presented, and the visiting teaching film, 'Unto the Least of These,' was shown. "The conference closed with a Sunday night sacrament meeting which focused on Relief Society. Singing Mothers from various branches joined together to provide music for the program. "It was wonderful for the sisters to be able to gather and feel the strength and support of one another." 306 April 1968 Glendale Stake (California) Presents "Color Your Life With Culture" December 1, 1967 Glendale Stake Relief Society officers, front row, left to right: Vergie Fischbeck, spiritual living class leader; Julene Acton, social relations class leader; Carol Smith, chorister; Mildred Thomas, Secretary-Treasurer; Grace Brown, organist.

"The program was adapted by Sister Barbara Moffat from 'Let All My Life Be Music.' Readings from Out of the Best Books, musical selections by the stake Singing Mothers, soloists, and groups, were introduced through a skit, 'Julie,' which featured a sister painting on life's easel, who changed her life from gray shapelessness to a vibrant richness. "The art exhibits were open before and after the program. Punch and cookies were served to over 600 guests. The discovery of many hidden talents and an appreciation of Relief Society by the husbands was a great reward." 308 Notes From the Field Memphis Stake (Tennessee) Holds First Relief Society Bazaar December 2, 1967 Front row, left to right: Melba Murphy, President, Helena (Ark.)

Participation was excellent, and hundreds of articles, emphasizing Church dress standards, were made. 'In the fall, a fashion show was staged, with mothers and children modeling the clothing. The guests were seated at beautifully decorated small tables where refreshments were served. Musical numbers and a guest commentator helped to make the event outstanding. 'Enthusiasm was so great that the sewing schools will be held again this year. We feel that it is a great addition to the lives of the sisters, learning to work together, sewing, budgeting money, time, materials, and learning something useful and profitable.'

Bountiful South Stake (Utah) Singing Mothers Present Christmas Concert December 1, 1967
Eulala H. Butters, President, Bountiful South Stake Relief Society, reports:
"Our Christmas concert had its inception early in the spring when a letter was directed to each ward, encouraging the sisters to write a song in keeping with the scriptures or the Christmas season, set to music.
"We were delighted when sixteen original compositions were submitted, all beautifully written. We used eight of these for our concert, and the others in stake leadership meetings. The original music was intermingled with a beautiful narration, written and given by Sister Elaine McKay.
"Organ music and Christmas carols sung by each ward group were a prelude to the concert. Beautiful displays of gifts, ornaments, and decorations greeted early arrivals. A tableau with special lighting effects made the concert complete. Nearly 1150 people attended the concert, and left with a special feeling of closeness to the Savior of the world, and a greater appreciation of the efforts of the Singing Mothers."

310 Lesson Department Discussion
10 Care of the Ill in the Home HOMEMAKING Development Through Homemaking Education Rae Jean Young, Faculty Member Brigham Young University, College of Nursing Northern Hemisphere: Second Meeting, July, 1968 Southern Hemisphere: December, 1968 OBJECTIVE: To suggest ways of easing the burden on the home nurse caused by illness in the home.

Slide or roll patient rather than lift. Have patient help when possible. Get help where patient is heavy and helpless.
OT She should also use a cover-all apron, good handwashing techniques, and proper waste disposal to prevent spread of disease to herself or to other family members.

HANDWASHING
Wash hands and wrists carefully before and after caring for the patient. Use a good soapy lather and make sure nails and areas between fingers are fully soaped. Rinse hands under hot running water with the stopper removed from basin. Dry hands with clean towel or disposable paper towel.

IMPROVISED HOME EQUIPMENT
A. Over bed table Lesson Department
Use a heavy, clean cardboard carton at least 10 by 12 by 24 inches with flaps removed. Cut curved pieces out of the two wide sides leaving at least 2" on the top to support table top. Adjust height of box to that of patient. The box may be covered with plastic or contact paper to make it washable.

A= SWAYS OF EASING THE BURDEN
While caring for the ill, the person carrying the most responsibility often finds that weariness soon sets in. The added amount of physical labor, plus the emotional strain, make it difficult for one person to do the job. Compassionate service provided by Relief Society sisters can be of inestimable value at such a time.
When illness is present in the home, sharing of responsibility and adjustment of usual responsibilities make the task much easier and the care of the patient much more complete. There are many ways in which the mother can rearrange work assignments so other members of the family share part of the increased work. This will not only save mother's energy, but will help other family members feel useful.
(Discuss possible ways of rearranging household chores.)

Home nursing may threaten to become a burden, yet it can be borne with greater ease and better grace if two things are present: First, knowledge—familiarity with simple home nursing techniques. Second, love and consideration—from all family members, including the patient. Tender, loving care is an important factor in the recovery of the patient.
The home nurse should not allow herself to be tied to the sick room day and night. Allowing a friend or neighbor to spend a few hours with the patient while she goes shopping, to a movie, to have her hair done, or to any activity outside of the home usually helps both nurse and patient.

3 THE RIGHT ATMOSPHERE
It is wise to create an atmosphere of calm and confidence about the patient. All family members will be called upon to give consideration to the patient, including any children in the home.
When a patient is confined to bed over an extended period of time, he often feels lonely and left out of family activities. When the illness is severe, isolation may be required, but once he begins convalescing he usually wants and enjoys company. This is true also of the handicapped, chronically ill, or the aged.
Mealtime visiting may be in order, with the doctor's permission. Allowing a family member to share a meal with the patient may reassure him that he is still very much a part of the family.
Visits and visitors must be kept within reasonable limits. For all visits a little briefing on suggested topics of conversation may be helpful. A child might be told, "Daddy has been asking about your school activities." For a visit with Grandma a remark such as, 'Tell Grandma about Tabby's new kittens." Even when a patient is alone, he can find diversion with the help of the home nurse. Books, magazines, newspapers, radio, and television are good companions.
Some patients who have never before enjoyed games, puzzles, etc., learn to enjoy them while bed-bound.

When there is illness in the home, the home nurse finds her work load and responsibilities will increase. It is vital that she keep her health up to par, and that she make every effort to follow, as nearly as possible, the usual pattern of living. Her family's routine must be considered, too, and disturbed as little as possible.
She should eat and sleep at customary times and get some needed recreation and diversion. At first, this may appear hard to accomplish, but it is a necessity—for the patient as well as the home nurse.

It would be helpful to write out a plan or daily schedule for the care of the patient for the use of the home nurse or her substitute.

WHEN HELP IS NEEDED

There are agencies and organizations which are for the express purpose of helping care for the ill in the home. In the United States and some other countries public health agencies will send a nurse to the home. The public health nurse is helpful in many ways. She will help arrange the physical setup for the sick room, suggesting the equipment necessary and possible ways of improvising. She will also demonstrate for the home nurse such things as feeding, bathing, and turning the patient.

In the United States of America, services of public health nurses are free to everyone regardless of socio-economic status. Visiting nurse agencies are found in many cities. They usually charge a nominal fee. The Red Cross is another valuable resource which is available in most parts of the world. The Red Cross is most helpful for instructions on caring for the ill.

315 COLORED PIECES

My grandma took into her hands one day
The scraps of fabric hoarded carefully
Against the time when riotous display
Of colors teased to set her fancy free.
Her eyes compared the bits of printed stuff
With those of delicate designs. She matched and trimmed until she had enough
To fill her need for seaming patterned lines.
Her mind encompassed cloth, yet she would stop
While she was plying needle steadily,
To straighten and arrange the growing top
Of gayest rings upon the quilt to be.
Creating beauty, she surveyed the whole
And knew that colored pieces feed a soul!
