The Cover: Frontispiece: Art Layout: Illustrations: WALK TENDERLY THE EARTH Walk tenderly the earth And note the springing grain, The swift upshooting blade and bud Where lately snow has lain. The shine of new green leaves Upon the bended limb. Walk tenderly the earth Remembering him. Walk tenderly the earth In blackened loam or sand, On gentle slope or steepest crag, Or on the moist, rich land. Within the bright of morning Or in the evening dim, Walk tenderly the earth Remembering him. Walk tenderly the earth And hear her choirs sing, The silent symphonies of stars, And meadows antheming. Along a wooded violet stream Or sudden canyon's rim, Join tenderly the earth In praising him.

I look forward to the arrival of The Relief Society Magazine with as much anticipation as I do to the visit of a relative who lives in a distant city. Whatever I am doing has to wait as I hurriedly turn the pages to see what is hidden therein. At times I cannot turn the pages fast enough. My eye spots something of particular interest, and in a more leisurely time I thoroughly digest it.

*Maurine Parker, Rupert, Idaho*

Thanks so much for the great lengths I am sure you go to in giving us such a wonderful Magazine. The contributions of the sisters—the art work (by Mary Scopes), the poetry, the testimonies, the meaningful fiction, and the inspiration of the homemakers of all ages are such a blessing to women, both in and out of the Church, and their families.

*Susan J. Smart, Springville, Utah*

I wish to express my love and appreciation for The Relief Society Magazine. Many of my friends are nonmembers, and the Magazine is a wonderful missionary tool. One dear friend remarked to me that she enjoys the stories more than those she reads in any other magazine. To her the "Mormon" writings have a profound message for all women, regardless of their religious background. How right she is!

*Dona Carpenter Hood, Anaheim, California*

I want you to know how much I do appreciate the beautiful presentation of my article "A Season for Christmas" in the December Magazine. Receiving a copy is one of the delights of my season, and the beautiful cover is an inspiration to all our guests as they see it on my table of Christmas books.

*Ruth C. Ikerman, Redlands, California*

Even though I am a full-time employed secretary and cannot attend Relief Society meetings, I would not want to miss receiving a copy of each Magazine. I enjoy the wholesome reading material the Magazines contain. Sometimes I must wait for an opportunity to read my copy, since my teenage daughter is eager to get it first. She can hardly wait for the next issue to come so that she can read the stories. I think the fiction stories are most outstanding reading for our youth as there are so many wonderful truths in them, and the messages will improve their lives if applied.

*Ruth H. Peterson, Thayne, Wyoming*

The Relief Society Magazine is always a source of inspiration, encouragement, and hope. I would like to thank the editors and the publishers for their devoted service in giving us the Magazine. I have been a Magazine representative for three years. "The Relief Society Magazine will ever be a living testimony to me."

*Thora B. Smith, Idaho Falls, Idaho*

Two and a half years ago my former neighbor Iva Shelly of Lone Pine, California, gave me a gift subscription to The Relief Society Magazine. Since the arrival of the first issue, I have found much inspirational value in the Magazine to help me to be a better wife and mother, and also a deeper love for the tasks set out for me to do. During my residency in Lone Pine, I became acquainted with several Relief Society women and attended some of the meetings. Now my subscription is being transferred to my new home.

163 March 1970 McKay have maintained a hospitable, righteous, and happy home, where love for one another, love of family, of friends, and love of God have prevailed. He has clearly defined for women their divine mission on earth: Though woman's life is filled with almost everything which is good and lovely, it is not difficult to choose the two activities that are paramount in her world.... Motherhood is the greatest potential influence either for good or ill. Next to motherhood, woman attains her highest glory in the realm of compassionate service.

("The Highest and Best in Woman's Realm," The Relief Society Magazine, January 1940, pp. 17-22.)

In seeking his counsel, the General Presidency found him approachable, affable, courteous, understanding of their needs and problems, but always clear and firm in his directives which reflected the inspired guidance of the Lord, to which he was entitled as God's chosen leader of his Church.

President McKay's respect for woman was evident in the lofty position he accorded her in the Church as well as in his everyday relationships with her. In a comparatively recent meeting with him, as President Spafford rose to leave, President McKay with great effort due to his physical condition started to arise. One of the brethren reached out to restrain him, saying it was not necessary for him to stand. Promptly President McKay replied, "I always stand when a lady leaves the room."

Today Relief Society has perhaps the most beautiful headquarters building of any woman's organization in the world. It was in September 1945 that President George Albert Smith, President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., and President David O. McKay authorized the Relief Society Presidency to launch the building program. It was a happy day in October 1952 when President David O. McKay advised the Relief Society Presidency, just prior to the opening of the Relief Society General Conference, that The First Presidency, President David O. McKay, President Stephen L Richards, and President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., had granted Relief Society the choice site on the corner of Main Street and North Temple on which to erect the headquarters building.

It was with rejoicing that the Relief Society women assembled on October 1953 in the shadow of the temple for the ground breaking ceremony, with President McKay turning the first shovel of dirt. On that occasion President McKay reminded us: No matter how commodious it may be, no matter how well-furnished the rooms, no matter how great the convenience of the furnishings, the house itself with all equipment is but a means to an end, and that end is the establishment in the hearts of the membership of the Church of a testimony of the truth of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.... It is the means to a glorious end, the salvation of our Father's children.... And so this house becomes a means of furthering the work of the great Relief Society, the very heart and purpose of which is to bring happiness and peace into the homes and the hearts of the Latter-day Saints.

(The Relief Society Magazine, 1954, p. 805.)

It was a sacred and impressive occasion when President McKay on October 3, 1956 offered the dedicatory prayer from the Relief Society Building. We commend to Relief Society women the world over a careful reading of this prayer which appears in the Relief Society Magazine, November 1956, page 788, from which are quoted a few excerpts:

More potent for the good and happiness of the Church members than we realize are the Priesthood Quorums for the men, and the Auxiliary organizations for the women. These Thou hast placed in the Church for mutual service. In serving one another, we serve our Lord and Savior, who himself hath said: "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."

On this memorable occasion, we praise thy name for the organization of the Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, for the thousands of loyal, faithful, beautiful women who compose its membership. Their devotion to duty is never-ending; their loyalty to Thee and to Thy Priesthood unquestioned; their administrations to the sick and to the needy, untiring; their sympathetic, gentle services give hope to the dying, comfort and faith to the bereaved.

O Father, bless these, thy choice, beloved Handmaidens!

The Lord has blessed his handmaidens.

He has blessed his Relief Society. He has blessed it through his divinely guided Prophets and Presidents since the day of its founding. The earthly mission of President McKay is finished. His responsibilities now must pass to other hands, but his contribution to the growth and advancement of the Church, the guidance he has given Relief Society, and the honor and respect he has accorded the women of the Church will ever remain a light and a blessing. Our hearts reach out in love and sympathy to Sister McKay whose influence on his life as wife and mother of his children and companion in service to the Church has been a blessing to him. Her devotion to Relief Society has been an enduring one, and her example of righteous Latter-day Saint womanhood has been a guiding light to countless Relief Society sisters. It is our earnest prayer that the comforting influence of the Lord will ever abide with Sister McKay and every member of the McKay family.

167 | Elder Bruce R. McConkie Of the First Council of Seventy [Address Delivered at the Officers Meeting of the Relief Society Annual General Conference, October 1, 1969]

Relief Society and I still receive fulfillment of the word, the promise your very sister Belle Spafford, whom, with you, I admire and appreciate, has spoken of the compassionate services of this great organization. If I may be given guidance by the Spirit, if I may be given utterance, due course, to eternal reward in our Father's kingdom.

As I thought and pondered what I should say today; questions like this came into my mind: What does the Relief Society mean to me? What does it mean to you, influence and the great organization which Sister Spafford so ably presides. Long service in a heaven-originated, a priesthood-led, and a gospel-oriented organization changes the lives of people and, providentially for me, it has changed the lives of those who are nearest and dearest to me. What it has done for them it can do and has done for great hosts of you.

Now for a text, and also to set the tone for what I hope I may be guided in saying, I shall read to you a brief statement from the journal of my father in which he speaks of his mother and of my grandmother. My grandmother, Emma Somerville McConkie, was a ward Relief Society president in Moab, Utah, many years ago. At the time of this experience, she was a widow.

My father writes this: Mother was president of the Moab Relief Society. J B__._[a __ nonmember who opposed the Church] had married a Mormon girl. They had several children; now they had a new baby. They were very poor and Mother was going day by day to care for the child and to take them baskets of food, etc. Mother herself was ill, and more than once was hardly able to get home after doing the work at the J B__._[a __ nonmember who opposed the Church] home. One day she returned home especially tired and weary. She slept in her chair. She dreamed she was bathing a baby which she discovered was the Christ Child. She thought, Oh, what a great honor to thus serve the very Christ! As she held the baby in her lap, she was all but overcome. She thought, who else has actually held the Christ Child? Unspeakable joy filled her whole being. She was aflame with the glory of the Lord. It seemed that the very marrow in her bones would melt. Her joy was so great it awakened her. As she awoke, these words were spoken to her, "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me." Charity Which Never Faileth.

Now, I think that the Lord first tried her faith. When he had proved her worthy by manifesting that charity which never faileth, then he gave her a glimpse within the veil. Next, I shall read the experience of another widow, the widow of Zarephath. This woman lived in the day of Elijah, the day when the Tishbite had sealed the heavens. There was no rain, and as a consequence, a great famine fell upon all the land.

The record says: The word of the Lord came unto him [that is, Elijah] saying, Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there: Behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee. So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink. And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand. And she said, As the Lord thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but a handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die. And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.

For thus saith the Lord God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth. She went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days. And the barrel of meal wasted - not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the Lord, which he spake by Elijah.

(1 Kings 17:8-16.)

Shortly after this Elijah raised the woman's son from death.

Here again, I think the Lord first tried her faith. When she had proved herself worthy by manifesting that charity which never faileth, she gained the preserving care of the Almighty for herself and her household.

Now, the fields of compassionate service have not all been plowed. Members of the Relief Society over the years have done wondrous work in this respect—the naked have been clothed; the hungry have been fed; the sick have been cared for and healed; but there are many occasions ahead for added service. We live in a perilous world situation. Things are not going to get better. They are going to get worse until the day of the coming of the Son of Man. And the tests that are being given to the members of the Lord's Church will, in my judgment, increase in severity and intensity.

And because of this there will be more opportunities than there hitherto have been to labor on the Lord's errands, to render service to our fellow men, and to do the things, patterned after these two examples that I have read, which will enable us to work out our salvation. A: the present moment we are engaged in war in Viet Nam and elsewhere. There are wives of servicemen, daughters of servicemen, and mothers of servicemen who would need the compassionate care and attention that only the sisters of this great God-inspired organization are capable of giving. And these conditions that now prevail on the earth 170 are going to multiply and abound and increase and give rise to needed added compassionate service to a degree and an extent that we, in my judgment, have never hitherto known. Now, what is it that the Relief Society does for the women of the Church? What did it do for my grandmother, the widow of Moab? What did it or its equivalent organization in ancient Israel, do for the widow of Zarephath? It is perfectly clear to me that the Relief Society was given of God for the temporal and spiritual blessing of the members of his kingdom, not alone of his daughters, but of his sons, and that it is the divine agency which aids in bringing the members of his Church to full salvation in his kingdom. May I remind you of what James said? Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world. (James 1:27.) We build on the atoning sacrifice of Christ. We know that by the grace and goodness of the Lord, salvation is available. But, then, in order to reap the blessings of eternal life, we have to do two things, both indicated in this revelation. First we have to keep the commandments of God, and second, we have to serve our fellow men. There is something more than the general theme of obedience that is involved in acquiring the attributes of godliness here and reaping eternal reward hereafter. That something is service to our fellow men. Christ the Lord was himself the perfect pattern in this thing; he said "I am among you as one that serveth." It is true that a woman's chief and most important work is in the home and with her family, and that as President McKay says, "No success compensates for failure in the home." But it is also true that every woman needs outside interests, that she needs a God-given way to use the charitable talent with which she is endowed, that service to one's fellow men is essential to salvation, and that the Relief Society is the organization God has established to enable women to serve and to be guided in those channels wherein they can fill the full measure of their creation. When we talk about gaining salvation, about acquiring the attributes of godliness in this life so that they can be multiplied and perfected and given to us in full in the life to come, we are talking about the family unit. God, our Heavenly Father, lives and presides in the family unit. We are literally his offspring. We are his children. We are members of his family. And he ordained the laws and the system whereby we could advance, progress, and become like him. To become like him, we have to have the same character, perfections, and attributes that he possesses. And we have to live in the family unit as he lives in the family unit. And so he has given us, in this life, eternal family units, units that begin here with the potential and the possibility of continuing hereafter in the same relationship that exists where he, himself, is involved. And he has given us the opportunity to experiment and labor and struggle and work and try in our Charity Which Never Faileth relationships with our fellow men to acquire those capabilities, those attributes, that measure of integrity and honesty and charity and decency and uprightness, that will enable us eventually to become like him. (Paul's expression is that we have to work out our salvation with fear and trembling before God.) The process of working out our salvation is one of acquiring the attributes of godliness, and this grows out of service and obedience. The matter of obedience is simply a matter of keeping the standards of personal righteousness that are involved; but the matter of service is a matter of getting out of ourselves and getting into the lives of other people, of touching the hearts of men, of taking to them the principles of the everlasting gospel, of helping them perfect and cleanse their lives, after they join the Church, of offering them temporal as well as spiritual blessings. It is just as essential that man eat temporal food as that he eat spiritual food. Without temporal food we will die physically, and without spiritual food we will die spiritually. The Relief Society organization is so geared, and so ordained as to work ably in both of these fields. When I leave this frail existence, When I lay this mortal by, Father, Mother, may I meet you In your royal courts on high? Then at length, when I've completed All you sent me forth to do, With your mutual approbation Let me come and dwell with you. Words of your great Relief Society poetess, Sister Eliza R. Snow! 171 March 1970 Now, in connection with this matter of Salvation, since there will be more women who will inherit full Salvation than there follows automathat women, accordingly, are In a position to labor and work in the compassionate services field in a far more effective and able manner than men ever could work. The deeds of two people. Sister Alice Colton Smith mentioned May I just take a moment to mention to you that we have Some great illustrations in the revelations where sisters are concerned. Mainly the Scriptures talk about what men have done because they deal with the organization of the kingdom and its general operation. But, providentially, the Lord has left us in the revelations enough scriptures to give us patterns for living. The patterns for living where women are concerned are such as these: We have the record of Mary, the mother of Christ. Gabriel ministered unto her. She was made the Mother of God. Her psalm of praise 172 ranks with the greatest psalms ever uttered, and, in my judgment, she is the Perfect example of complete submission to the will of the Lord. Her statement to Gabriel when the annunciation occurred was: "Behold, the handmaid of the Lord, be it unto me according to thy word." (Luke 1:38.) And that ranks with what Christ himself said in the pre-existent sphere—"Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever," (Moses 4:2.) Eve is another. She is, in fact, the pattern for all women. She knew the plan of Salvation; she preached the gospel; she prayed for blessings; she bore children; she taught the gospel.

And one of the greatest single-sentence sermons that we have in all our revelations was spoken by Eve: "If it were not for our transgression, we never should have had seed, and never should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient." (Moses 15: 11.) In the light of our knowledge is the plan of salvation. Is it any wonder that our hymn says Mother of our generations, Glorious by great Michael's side, Take thy children's adoration; Endless with thy Lord preside.... Now, we might go on with Sarah, with Rebecca, with Rachel, with others, but time does not permit. But out of it all we come to the conclusion that everything that it is possible for man on earth to have—of a spiritual, ennobling, edifying, sanctifying nature—is available for the women of the Lord's kingdom. They can become daughters of Jesus Christ. They take upon them the Lord's name. They are entitled to personal revelation. They can get all of the visions and guidance that men receive. When Rebecca had a problem, she went out and took it up with the Lord. And the record says "And the Lord said unto her," (Genesis 23:23) and she received the answer. Well, our time is up. I would just like to ask you this question as I come back now to the theme that I mentioned and the expressions that were read relative to these two widows: Of whom think ye that this revelation speaks? Charity Which Never Faileth Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? Or thirsty, and gave thee drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? Or naked, and clothed thee? Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I Say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. (Matt. 25:34-40.) In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, Amen. VED BETWEEN HIM OR HER AND THEE ALONE "And if thy brother or sister offend thee, thou shalt take him or her between him or her and thee alone; and if he or she confess thou shalt be reconciled." (D&C 42:88.) Sit down; break bread with me We've need of talk we two. The Spirit whispers this must be Resentment's voice presents another view. How swiftly feet do run to seek a solace And wounded pride avenge and vindicate To tell a friend to talk of the injustice Gives swift release and anger does abate. To tell one friend, how quick to tell another So sweet the role of self-appointed judge, And heady with self-righteous zeal we smother The promptings; while we fondly hold our grudge. A Prophet's book tells of a better way That offers joy not of the worldly throng A hymn of peace, a hope of brighter day A music sweeter than the grandest paean song. Then sit; break bread with me, We've need of a talk we two. With thee and me: with us alone If we would rise to that celestial throne. Lea nor J. Brown 173 "My Yoke Is Easy and My Burden Is Light" Alice C. Smith Member, General Board of Relief Society [Address Delivered at the Officers Meeting of Relief Society Annual General Conference, October 1, 1969.] Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. (Matt. 11:28-30.) Across the centuries from the shores of the eastern Mediterranean comes this warm invitation from our Savior. As Jesus climbed the dry hills of Galilee or trod the dusty roads of Judaea, he met poverty, disease, and afflictions of every kind. And out of these, He found the sinner repentant and unrepentant. He met in solicitation, In 1830, Smith declared that "God is the same unchangeable God." (D&C 90:17.) and so it was that on July 28th in 1843, six Relief Society sisters were appointed to relieve the wants of Relief Society—Historical Sketch, Amy Brown Lyman. Teen in a world of millions! But there had to be a beginning. In 1843, sixteen, today, well over one hundred thousand; the day after tomorrow two million. For many years, I was delighted to see her. I wanted to know all about her. I asked her what she was doing in the Church now. "Oh, thought, after we parted, would she feel if the Savior came to her next visiting teacher meet- "I want you to be my helper, to tell all the women in your ward about visiting teaching and care for them so that all will be blessed with a love that is not just a chore or as a great spiritual blessing and privilege given to them by their Savior? To the visiting teacher, then, is given the great responsibility of searching out those in need. Moreover, she tells all her sisters by her visit that someone cares and that God cares. The visiting teacher should be safe. It is someone who listens and someone who wants to listen. It is someone who is interested in what happens to her friend. It is someone who always helps when needed. When I go to the door and see my best friend standing there, can't wait to open the door to let her in. I am delighted to see her. I love her as I know she loves me. The visiting teacher should evoke such a response in everyone over whom she watches. She "My Yoke Is Easy and My Burden Is Light" is not someone, or she should be. "I've just a few minutes—You've read the Message and you know it better than I do, and besides, you don't need it anyway. How are you? And I'll see you at the next Relief Society meeting." The visiting teacher should leave behind her love that blesses both the sister and most intimate friend, but she should be the best friend. A few years ago as I was leaving the chapel after a Relief Society meeting, my visiting teacher stopped me. "Alice," she said: "I've just something for you," "But you do need Something for me," I said: "You bring me a message of love."

I am your concern for me and my family. But she didn't seem entirely satisfied.

Bread. "After I left you today," she remembered, "you told me once that your university duties keep you so busy you never have time to bake bread." So five years ago we returned to our home after a three-year's absence. We were tired from driving, and there stood this same visiting teacher (now long since released) with a loaf of freshly baked bread and a jar of raspberry jam and the explanation that she had seen us drive by just as she was about to take the bread out of the oven.

I love the emblem of the Relief Society with its motto, "Charity Never Faileth," but my own private emblem of visiting teaching will always be a loaf of freshly baked homemade bread. We are "to relieve the wants of all." In our confused and complex world, as in the world of Jesus, there is loneliness, despair, sin, sorrow, and suffering. We do not know which day will find these in the home of our friends. We must be prepared.

Compassion is a way of life. Darlene, young, pretty, charming, the mother of a young baby, developed multiple sclerosis. Swiftly the disease progressed so that she couldn't even take care of her baby. It was at this time that she was visited by two compassionate visiting teachers. "Pour oil and wine to the wounds of the distressed," counseled the Prophet Joseph Smith. They continued to call and to help. Her other friends, at first attentive, visited less and less often as the years went by. Her husband deserted her. Darlene grew bitter. She met overtures of help with angry hostile words. Why should she lie in bed helpless when others traveled, worked, and played as they wished? Why should she lie in bed and grow weaker and weaker? She railed against her fate, and as she did, her friends ceased to come.

One of the visiting teachers moved away, and the other was released, but her loving care did not stop. Through the years she visited frequently, offering her continuing care. She saw through Darlene's angry, hostile words. Even when they were directed against her, she did not forsake the hurt and suffering one.

Recently Darlene's family moved to Utah. Darlene, now completely bedridden and still under forty, moved here also. Was that the end of her old visiting teacher's care? No. A long distance telephone call to a member of the visiting teacher's family in Utah: "Please go see Darlene. Tell her that I think of her and love her. Please go see her whenever you can."

Compassion is a way of life. Years of care and distance make no difference when a visiting teacher is a loving best friend. The visiting teachers' messages are important. The rules that govern our visiting teaching are important, but beyond and above them all, and far more important, is the understanding, concerned, and loving heart.

Never were visiting teachers more needed. The visiting teacher may never meet a Darlene, but every month she finds those who need love and acceptance. Loneliness plagues our world. Loneliness wears many faces. We may not suspect its presence, but it is often there. Every year the Church grows bigger, and as it does, the need for visiting teachers grows greater.

What will be their future? They will help combat the loneliness which plagues our world and impersonality of the big cities. They will look after the stranger, the widow, the orphan, the wounded, and distressed. They will look after all sisters with loving, concerned care. They will be needed as my grandmother was needed when she left her warm, pioneer bed on stormy nights to drive miles with a horse and buggy in response to a cry of need.

As my mother during the depression found the hungry, so will they. As my visiting teacher brought me a loaf of freshly baked homemade bread and love, so will they. They will help relieve physical, emotional, and mental suffering. They will aid the sinner and comfort the sorrowing. They will carry a message of gospel love to all the sisters throughout the world every month.

As their Red Cross and Volunteering Emil E. Henderson "My Yoke Is Easy and My Burden Is Light" warm, tender care spreads its web around our earth, they will become a standard to the nations.

Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. (Matt. 11:28-30.)

God bless the visiting teachers. For when all work together, the yoke is easy and the burden is light. By this shall all men know that we are our Lord's disciples, if we have love one to another. May it ever be so, I pray in the name of our loving Savior, Jesus Christ, Amen.

At this time great emphasis is being given to the idea that the individual volunteer holds the key to solving many of the nation's problems. We have learned that government cannot reach all the recesses of human need. Just as the effort of the individual seemed inadequate against the wilderness in pioneer times so does the single effort fall short of significant solutions of community ills in our day.

Thus, we meet the challenge by organizing groups of volunteers in Red Cross, the Church, and other community agencies that collectively we may meet the needs of the neglected, the troubled, the handicapped, and the ill. Volunteering even goes further than meeting needs of the unfortunate. People under this banner teach classes and provide leadership and instruction in character building and recreation activities in many facets of the community including civic and church programs.

We need to make a sincere effort to serve and involve the entire community. Helping all its people to meet their human needs is one of the most important tasks facing our nation today. It is an exciting challenge that calls for creative response by all keen-minded, socially alert individuals and groups. By virtue of its scope and social significance, it is also a task that requires maximum effort on the part of everyone.

In the vast field of volunteering, all kinds of needs must be met, and there is a place for people with all manner of skills. All of us have something to offer that will be a significant contribution in the broad field of service to others. The American National Red Cross has committed itself to total involvement in this national effort.

We encourage greater effort on the part of all people that we may bring hope and comfort to all in need of the hand of fellowship, thus fulfilling the admonition "... as I have loved you, ye also love one another." (John 13:34.)

177 EDITORIAL/ A Divine Gift

@ 'What would you do,"' Sarah earnestly inquired of Emma, "'if the Lord offered you a gift?'' Emma looked at Sarah as if she thought she had taken leave of her senses. ''Why, I'd accept it.'' Sarah looked at her almost triumphantly. '"'You would, wouldn't you? Well, that is the way | feel about my membership in Relief Society. It is a gift to me, and a gift to you, and we both have accepted the gift. And it is a gift offered to every woman who is free from censure, and received by vote, and it is guaranteed to bring blessings of joy into a woman's life as she follows its teachings, and ministers to others." Relief Society is a divine gift and according to the natures of women. It draws out the sympathies of a woman's heart and expands her soul.

Of first importance in a woman's life is her family. Relief Society helps her to perfect her family relationships. She receives encouragement and enlightenment through her attendance to honor the priesthood in her home and train up her children to do likewise. She studies the doctrines of the Church and strengthens her testimony—the wellspring to her actions. She learns better ways of housekeeping and homemaking. She learns to appreciate literature, music, and art, and prizes the culture found in her own home and beautifies and enriches the life of her family by introducing new refinement into the furnishings and daily family life.

Relief Society is a catalyst which takes women of different nationalities, viewpoints, training, culture, even understanding, and, as the woman's auxiliary of the Church, the divine gift of a loving Father binds and welds them together. Recently a meeting was held of sisters from Hong Kong, Japan, Australia, Germany, Hawaii, New Zealand, South Africa, Great Britain, Bolivia, Brazil, and Norway. They were in Volume 57 March 1970 Number 4 THE GENERAL BOARD Belle S. Spafford, President Marianne C. Sharp, First Counselor Louise W. Madsen, Second Counselor Mayola R. Miltenberger, Secretary-Treasurer Salt Lake City for Relief Society Annual General Conference. The only barrier was difference in language. The same sisterly spirit animated every voice. They were all converts of the Church and had been given the Holy Ghost. Then they had welcomed and accepted the Father's divine gift to them. Through its teachings and practices they were progressing along the straight path. Not alone, but accompanied and encouraged by the great sisterhood of the Church.

These sisters had been called to positions of leadership by the proper priesthood authorities. The mantle of authority had fallen upon them in their respective positions and among their native sisters. Ringing in their ears was the Prophet's voice: ''This Society is not only to relieve the poor but to save souls.'' A great responsibility rests upon the Relief Society member, be she one who leads or one who follows. Her membership places upon her either the direction of affairs or the acceptance of direction. Heavenly Father uses his gift to mold and fashion his daughters' spirits, both by ministering and by being ministered unto as the occasion demands.

The training in Relief Society is unique. The rewards are soul-satisfying and are showered upon the member's family and not confined to her alone. President Hugh B. Brown declared, "The Relief Society, and all the members thereof, are or should be, willingly harnessed to the task of serving their fellow men. And this IS a continuing obligation and a continuing benediction."

On the 128th anniversary of Relief Society, the Savior's words remind every Relief Society member, ''Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.'' (Matt. 25:40.)

Ramona W. Cannon
Mrs. LaVern W. Parmley, General President of the Latter-day Saint Primary Association, received an "Outstanding Citizen Award" from Region Twelve of Boy Scouts of America in November, in Salt Lake City, Utah. She was cited for her many years of service to the youth of the region. Mrs. Parmley was the first woman ever to serve on a national scouting committee. She said that fifty thousand cub scouts are being trained in the Primary and that eighty-five per cent of the boys are being graduated from Primary as Second Class Scouts.

Mrs. Frieda Ward is the capable administrator of the Spafford Memorial Children's Hospital at Jerusalem. She is the daughter of the late Bertha Spafford Vester, founder of the hospital, who also sponsored foundling homes, clinics, and soup kitchens. The hospital cares for Arab and Israeli children and any others in need of help. It is supported by a fundraising organization, of which noted explorer and lecturer Lowell Thomas is president.

Sylvia Porter, brilliant syndicated columnist on financial matters, recently wrote five frank articles analyzing the economy of 1969 as compared to the 1929 stock market crash in the United States, followed by a world depression. No rules protected the stock-buying public in 1929, she points out. Now there are stringent protective rules. Also the self-regulatory powers of the markets and exchanges have become progressively tighter. The disciplinary powers of these self-regulatory agencies have never been tougher. Therefore, a market crash today is far less likely than in 1929.

In 1969 Janet Lynn, fifteen, became the ladies Figure Skating champion. Also Diane Crump, the first girl jockey in a Hialeah horse race, came in tenth. Eight girls enrolled in the Temple University ROTC program. Vivien Kellems, seventy-two, waged a war against unfair taxes for single persons. Shirley R. Heinze and Frances V. Chaffin were the first women to be graduated from the United States Army Command School. Both served in Vietnam.

For the second time in history, the president of the United Nations is a woman, Angie E. Brooks, Assistant Secretary of State for Liberia. Dr. Lois M. Jones, Kay L. Lindsay, Eileen R. McSaveny, and Terry Lee Tickhill became the first women to be given a natural science grant to study the Antarctic Regions. Mrs. Cynthia Clark Wedel was elected president of the National Council of Churches, another historic first.

Miss Maxine Jones, of Provo, Utah, entered the University of Utah Medical School's Rehabilitation Center almost totally paralyzed from an automobile accident. After six months' therapy and heroic personal effort, she could move her arms freely and walk with the aid of a crutch. She expects to become completely normal and hopes to establish a foundation for more studies on nerve tissue regeneration, to help other such cases.

The Center is the only "wide team" approach rehabilitation center between the Mississippi and the Pacific Coast. "Wide team" means that patients receive help, as needed, from physical, speech, occupational, and other kinds of therapists, and from social workers, psychologists, nurses, and physicians. In this team are a number of Latter-day Saint men and women.

181 Belief Society World-Wide Decade of Accomplishment 1968-69 ANNUAL REPORT

"The secret of success is constancy to purpose." —Benjamin Disraeli

"Constancy" and "success" become key words as the accomplishments, the program, Society in 1969 and the decade just closed are evaluated and reviewed. As in human development, the growth process of an organization may be imperceptible if viewed from day to day, but from the vantage point of time one is able to measure true increase.

In the case of Relief Society, as will be noted from the following report, steady, marked—even phenomenal progress and accomplishment have taken place in the past ten years. And the organization of Relief Society

183 MEMBERSHIP

Three hundred twenty-five thousand individual women—women of different aspirations, hopes, needs, with varying capabilities, backgrounds, nationalities—but of common purpose—now hold membership in Relief Society. These Relief Society women are faithful, obedient, devoted, sisterly women—women characterized by a desire to learn, to develop talents, to acquire new skills, to enhance existing capabilities, to increase their understanding of the gospel and spiritual matters, and to serve their Church.

Three hundred twenty-five thousand forty-two women represent an increase of 13,171 over 1968 membership figures and 110,840 over 1960. In spite of this remarkable membership increase, the question may yet remain—where is Relief Society as 1969 passes? The forthcoming figures will show advances in nearly every facet of Relief Society work, but are figures alone a sufficient evaluation?

True measure of growth or success of the Relief Society organization can be gauged best by the impact of Relief Society upon the individual member. Has each one's testimony been strengthened by Relief Society; has self-development occurred; have her homemaking skills been enhanced; benevolent service opportunities been accepted; community interests been heightened; Church assignments been eagerly, faithfully, and efficiently accepted and carried out—has the "inner woman" been nurtured by reason of the program of Relief Society? If the answer is "yes," then there truly has been a full measure of achievement in 1969 and in the decade.

ORGANIZATIONS

What a chronicle could be written regarding the inspiration, the planning, and conferring, as the 7,298 ward, stake, mission, district, and branch organizations have been formed by the priesthood and their work carried forward by Relief Society leaders. As each organization has developed, leadership opportunities have also been made available.

During 1969, 215,278 women were involved in directing Relief Societies throughout the world.

SERVICES

"If you would have God have mercy on you—have mercy on one another..." —Prophet Joseph Smith from Relief Society Minutes, June 9, 1842.

From the very first, the most fundamental work of Relief Society and the one by which it is most widely known has been the love-inspired services, the sympathetic, tender, merciful assistance to those in distress; visits to the homes of the sisters and related activities in which something has been done by one for another. Who can properly measure what it has meant in the lives of people as 36,667 eight-hour days care of the sick (1969) were freely given, or as comforting assistance was rendered at time of death for 15,315 families; 773,072 hours of other compassionate service given, such as caring for children during illness of mothers or caring for aging sisters. Such is the record of ministrations of benevolent service for 1969.

Add to this 5,237,739 visits by visiting teachers who go from home to home month after month not only giving, as Eliza R. Snow once said, "A kind expression—a few words of counsel, or even a warm and affectionate shake of the hand..." but also presenting the messages and in many ways assisting the home. What a leavening, uplifting influence in the world—what a power for good!

As Sister Spafford reminded Relief Society in her 1969 Conference address, "We look back so that we may go better forward."

BRILLIANT FLOWERS FOR ADORNING A WALL Highland Stake Eva A. Sipkema, President Representative design by Ina Cannon A woman's own imagination and creativeness can be used to design a lovely picture such as this. Two-thirds of a yard of velvet, polished cotton, or other attractive material could be used as background.

The leaves and stems were first embroidered on the material. The flowers were made on a loom (the same type as is used to make straw flowers) in three different sizes and in blending colors. The flowers were glued onto the material. Odds and ends of yarn can be used for making the flowers. The completed design is then mounted in an appropriate frame.

A SCENIC WASTEBASKET
Monument Park West Stake � Orlene J. Pulsen, former President
Creative Handicraft by Afton Nelson
This "travelogue wastebasket" makes an attractive addition to any young person's room. Sister Nelson's son rode his bicycle on an extended vacation in many parts of the United States. He mailed postcards to his mother from places visited on the tour. His mother saved the pictures and covered a wastebasket with them. They were attached with a coat of good white glue, and, when thoroughly dry, three coats of shellac were sprayed on the wastebasket. Every time the son looks at the basket he remembers his enjoyable trip—and the thoughtfulness of his mother.

A SHADOW BOX FOR TREASURES
Bountiful South Stake Ivonne J. Rigby, President
Creative Handicraft by Coy Tyson
The wooden box was painted with green water-base paint and finished with six coats of clear varnish. The lid was placed upside down and decorated by means of a decoupage process. (See "Make Your Heirlooms With Decoupage," by Winifred D. Anderson, March 1969, page 202.) Designs may be cut from prints of colorful pictures, classical or modern, from magazine illustrations, from greeting cards, or other sources. The basic and larger design is placed on the top of the lid, with individual motifs cut from a duplicate pattern for placing on the inside of the lid.

CHRISTMAS IN IDAHO FALLS STAKE
Alice B. Jones, President
This beautiful display illustrates a spiritual theme for Christmas and portrays the Magi, the manger scene, and Mary riding on the donkey. The family Bible presents a reminder of the scripture telling of the birth of the Christ Child. A shining wreath of pine cones, sprayed with gold, enhances the background. The tall ornament is made of four snifters glued together and attached to a glass plate with water soluble glue. Ball tree beads and gold ornaments are used for making the looped chain decorations. Nativity figurines are placed inside the snifters. The nativity scene is made with a hexagon and three triangles cut from glass, having the triangles glued to every other side of the hexagon. The edges of the triangles have gold cording glued on them and a piece of styrofoam sprayed with gold for the base of the arrangement with gold sprayed straw on top of the base. Small gold nativity figures are placed on the straw. The Christmas tree design is planned especially for children and decorated with small Santa Claus figures—providing color and emphasizing the festive, gift-giving spirit of Christmas. The attractive merry-go-round makes a delightful centerpiece for a children's Christmas party. Constructed on a cardboard base of two circles, using stick candy for poles and gumdrops to decorate the canopy, the colorful merry-go-round is an invitation to fun and the joyful appreciation of children.

TABLES TELL AN "INVITING" STORY
PATIO TABLES
Canyon Rim Stake, Wilma B. Merrell, President
Fringed royal blue placemats were arranged as color accents on this patio table. Rattan plate holders supported the paper plates which were decorated with yellow and blue flowers to harmonize with the blue and yellow centerpiece made of gumdrops. Root beer bottles had been attractively covered with blue aprons to match the placemats. Each apron displayed a white straw in the pocket. Small flower pots filled with gumdrop flowers carried out the colors and the pattern of the centerpiece. A speckled "bunbird" made of reinforced cloth held the rolls. A drinking straw made a long beak for the "bunbird."

A WHEAT TABLE WITH GOLDEN ACCENTS
This lovely table has for a focal point an old-fashioned lamp holding long, graceful stems of bearded wheat, golden as the bread in the serving tray. Moss-green ribbon tied in an attractive bow is placed around the lamp. A fabric-covered tray adds color to this "memoried" table setting.

A SOCIAL TABLE FOR AUTUMN
Denver West Stake Betty Z. Curtis, President
Fruits of autumn and music for the season made an appropriate theme for this "Simply beautiful" table setting. The lovely figurine holding the violin in her hand is the focal point for the colorful artificial grapes in the center of the table. Tiny sheets of music appear among the grapes to enhance the theme. Colored napkins, blending with the grapes, enhanced the table. A beautiful cloth, with appropriate silver and china completed this setting for autumn—or any time.

BLUE AND GOLD FOR A RELIEF SOCIETY ANNIVERSARY SOCIAL
Parleys Stake, Salt Lake City, Utah
Mary B. Riley, President
Table Setting by Winona Powelson
A collapsible hatrack (which can be purchased for approximately $1) was sprayed yellow and placed in the center of the table, with small baskets of blue flowers arranged in each "v" of the rack. A tall bouquet was placed in the center, displaying flowers made from a blue lining material. Each flower was composed of five petals glued on wire. The stems were made from wire wrapped with florest tape. A yellow butterfly graced each basket of flowers, and a yellow candle was glued on each peg of the rack. The rings which held the attractive yellow napkins were made by gluing Relief Society seals together to form a circle.

A TABLE FOR "COMMUNICATIONS"
Hillside Stake, Salt Lake City, Utah
Leah C. Wood, President
Table Setting by Laura Cutler
A piece of wood approximately six inches square, sprayed in gold, formed the base for this design. A miniature telephone pole made from wooden dowels and sprayed gold was fitted into the wooden base. The pole was decorated with various tints of nylon net and artificial begonias. A green cord was attached to the telephone pole, and at the other end of the cord was a miniature pink telephone.

STITCHERY FROM WALNUT CREEK STAKE, CALIFORNIA
Muriel P. Cottle, President
Nearly all the brilliantly colored and carefully stitched items in this display were original in design and exquisite in workmanship. The project was designed to encourage the sisters to do creative stitchery and it has been very successful. The attractive quilt was made as a group accomplishment, with blocks three inches square, designed and embroidered by various Relief Society women. The blocks were made on a foundation of old blue jeans and crocheted together. The miniature picture on its tiny easel with its mouse mama and baby is a constant delight to children and grown up children as well. The desk set was covered with velveteen and trimmed with gold braid and brocade ribbon, making it very elegant. The trimming was glued to the velveteen with good quality white glue. For an attractive and useful addition to a child's room, this set could be covered with oilcloth and a less ornate braid used.

USEFUL AND ORNAMENTAL FOR THE HOME OR FOR THE OFFICE
Scottsdale Stake, Arizona
Valma T.

Hakes, President The owls are watching you! These charming 'watch birds' were made from various sizes of pine cones, acorns, bark, and driftwood. The heads were made from pine cones cut in half, the flat sides being used for the face, and the acorns, used for making the eyes, were painted white around the edges and black in the center. The wings were made from pine bark shaped with scissors. The body was glued to the driftwood first, then the head, eyes, wings, and horns. The horns were separate petals cut from pine cones.

CHILDREN PREFER COLOR. Ry.~. - 7 >. \) Children's Clothing oom Cottonwood Stake, Salt Lake City, Utah�Carroll P. Sevy, President A large backdrop which covered the wall space had been painted with lifesize pictures of children going to school, with the 'little old red schoolhouse' in the background. On the figures was placed the children's clothing.

Quilt With Raggedy Ann Dolls�South Bear River Stake, Utah Irene P. Kerr, President The Raggedy Ann dolls in the center of the quilt were so realistically designed and stitched that one almost felt that a child could take the dolls from the quilt and play with them. The colorful afghan displayed with the quilt was made on a hairpin lace frame from various colors of yarn.

A Table for Toys�Kearns Stake, Utah�Faye J. Woodward, President The cuddly bunnies on the top of the table were made from white plush material. A wise old owl also sits on the table, and around the edge, below the bunnies, are dolls cut from thin wood. These are like paper dolls but more durable. Felt was glued on the bodies of the dolls and the faces were hand painted. The dolls were dressed in authentic costumes representing many nations.

SEA AND MOUNTAIN, FOREST AND FLOWER Text and illustrations by Claire W. Noall There was the sea and the mountain with the forest and the flowers in between. For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength... Out of the south cometh the whirlwind... Out of the north... Frost is given... Hearken... Stand still and consider the wondrous works of God. (From Job, Chapter 37.)

The seas formed. Mountains rose and were forested. Storms�lightning, age, and the saw�topple great trees. Rivers carry them. But the seas may return them denuded to the shore. (Pacific Ocean, La Push, Wash.)

Over the years the seasons depart and return. Seeds ripen, and after fruition snow falls, nourishing in their beds minute gems�the bright flowers of the grass. And the hills are made gentle with spring. (Stanislaus National Forest, Sierra Nevada Mountains, California)

The magnificent earth brings forth great yields of forest, grass, and seed. In the eternal round, shrubs come to their greening in a bowery of leaves and a splendor of blossoms. (Redbud Tree in Three Rivers Canyon, Sierra Mountains, California)

Forests live in cool green splendor and count their years in centuries. The tall spires of the giant fir and cedar measure their height from the meridian of time, upward through a single shaft, their spires reaching heavenward, unrivalled in dignity and endurance.

Will man�with dominion over the earth�its waters and its woods�be able to reflect in his own life the divinity that shaped his world�the plan that gave him agency and choice�and offered a measure of heaven in space and time upon the earth? (Douglas Firs, MacMillan Park, Vancouver Island, British Columbia)

202 Where rain does not fall, sands accumulate, sift, and harden. For long periods, the low hills and the desert valleys may appear barren except for thorn, low-lying bramble, and forbidding pattern of leaf and stem. A miracle may then become manifest. Dunes and hollows will form their own designs of light and shade, pattern and color. (near Tucson Arizona)

Through the force of frost, ice, and water, streams sculptured their various ways from glaciers to the sea. In light and shadow they molded depth and pinnacle, precipice and channel. But at times the mystery of running water ripples in quiet pools. (Merced River, Yosemite National Park, California)

"AND TELL OF TIME" Unique and ornate clock, with the flight of birds telling the passage of time and greenery for the constant seasons. Made by Coy Tyson Bountiful South Stake (Utah) Homemaking Leader

TRANSPARENCY BY J M. HESLOP WALL HANGING OF SYMBOLIC BEAUTY This lovely wall hanging was presented as a gift to Relief Society by Alice Randall, a Chippewa Indian of Crandon, Wisconsin. The design was taken from a ceremonial drum belonging to her tribe that is over one hundred years old. Sister Randall was Indian Mother of the year in Wisconsin for 1967. The pattern was perfected on a rug loom which Sister Randall has in her home. Similar designs are woven for use on tote bags, pillow covers, and other useful and beautiful articles, as well as the symbolic wall hangings.

204 SAN LORENZO BRANCH, SAN JOSE WEST STAKE PRESENTS "BACK TO THE MORMON PIONEERS," July 1968 Beverly Muir, Chairman Bernice Hutchinson, President, San Jose West Stake Relief Society For this unique outdoor occasion, the booths were made of logs and the Relief Society sisters and their families wore pioneer costumes. Demonstrations of pioneer crafts included spinning yarn, dying wool with natural dyes, weaving, quilting, hairpin lace, and braided and hooked rugs. Bread was made, butter was churned, 'jerky' meat was processed, soap was made, and corn was husked. Antiques of the pioneer era were displayed. There was a table loaded with home-baked bread, pies, cakes, and cookies. Homemade ice cream was served. Pioneer songs played from an amplifier set a nostalgic mood and the finale of the evening was an old-fashioned square dance.

Dunes and Distance and Beautiful Bushes Monument Valley, Utah

In the late spring rains pour on the Jericho sand dunes, an untamed part of the Great American Desert, which includes the Great Basin between the Rockies and the Sierra Nevada Mountains from Oregon to Mexico. Suddenly the blossoms appear. The entire spring is gray with rains. Great billowy clouds turn coral at sunfall, are set with double rainbows.

PED A PART OF ME

It may be in a crowded thoroughfare,
She leaves a bit of smile, her copper hair
Catching flecks of sun, like shards of faith;
Perhaps in evening's quiet, like a wraith
Of loneness she will make the day's long strife
A meaningful appraisal of her life;
Or morning at the organ while her fingers
Feel a melody, a song that lingers.

It may be little, great, or of no worth,
Somewhere, this day
A part of me in her walks on the earth.

THE FLOWERING DUNES (continued from page 207)

By June the honey-colored sands are patterned with the glory of the warm rose-tinted blossoms and the rich, green leaves of those beautiful, trailing plants—the sand verbenas. Like a wide flowered quilt thrown over the dunes, they glow under the blue and white skies in that season that separates the springtime from the summer.

The sand verbena, with its long tap roots deeply driven into the desert can survive endless drought, but rains eventually rouse the slumbering desert into a brief but magnificent flowering, wakening seeds that may have slept for decades into a gold and flaming hour. Death and life forever commune on the shifting dunes.

Here a fence dives into oblivion in a curve of sand.
Flowers, lilywhite, pale orchid, blue, rose, ring an old weathered-to-silver tree trunk, so hollow it is almost lace.
The nest of a kingbird hidden in the hollow holds four brown and white eggs.
Beetles leave the delicate embroidery of their goings and comings around the clusters of verbenas.
And under all pulse the eternal, beautiful scallops the whispering winds have carved in the sand.

In the wide and wonderful "Great Basin," where Indians wandered and Spanish conquistadors rode followed by the waves of western migration—the explorers, fur trappers, gold miners, cattle men, sheep men, farmers, each with his dream of conquest or settlement—there are hidden remote dune-lands where nature spreads its unbelievable beauty unconquered by the might of man, giving its own particular radiance to the joy of the earth.

Mary Ellen McKune

@ "I believe it's time we gave those mulberry bushes something to do," Mama declared one evening, just as Michael and I were on our way to bed. It had been two years since Mama had bought the little bushes from President Brigham Young and planted them in the front yard close to the house. Now I was eight, and those "little" bushes had grown taller than I was.

"What do you mean?" Michael and I both asked, but Mama would only say, "Those leaves will be delicious for our worms," and when we broke into giggles, she repeated "delicious, I say." If only it had been a joke!

The next morning, as Mama was spooning the last of the oatmeal into baby Sukey's breakfast bowl, my six-year-old brother suddenly remembered her enigmatic statement of the night before.

"Are you really going to get some worms, Mama? Like Sister Bigelow?" I sighed to myself. Little brothers and their stupid questions! Worms, indeed!

"Sit down and finish your breakfast, son." Father liked a calm table.
Michael wriggled back onto the chair but made no pretense of eating. His eyes were all for Mama.

She sat down unhurriedly with her own bowl of oatmeal.

"We're going to raise silkworms, Michael."

That's when I started to listen. Mother didn't look twinkling and funny this morning; she was serious when she talked of the worms.

"Silkworms? What are they?" I asked.

"Know!" Michael was up on his knees again.
"They're big long!"

Aghast, I think I dropped my spoon into my bowl. At least I remember hearing the clatter.

"Are they really, Mama?"

Father answered. "Actually, they are about three or four inches long at full growth—"

"And they have fifty legs and they crawl all around eating up leaves and sometimes they get on people and scare girls!"

"That's enough, Michael. If you're through, get on out to your garden work."

Michael bounced out of his seat and skipped toward the kitchen door, singing something about "creepy, crawly worms." I followed more slowly, my stomach heavy and my two forefingers measuring off an imaginary three or four inches.

After school, I was listlessly scuffing up dust from the street we lived on and wishing heartily that we had never joined in the whole neighborhood's planting of those old mulberry bushes! Now, when I got home, there would be a box of worms waiting for me!

"Sara, come on!" Margery Johnson teased, slowing down beside me.
"I said let's race, and you didn't even hear."

"Margery, what are silkworms like? Michael said they are like big white caterpillars."

"I don't know." Margery pushed one of her gorgeous blonde plaits back over her shoulder as she swung into step beside me.

"Maybe they eat silk." "That couldn't be it. We don't have enough silk to feed them. Besides, what would be the use of that?"

I realized then that Margery didn't know any more than I did.

"My mother said Brother Suddeth was bringing some over to our house today. A whole box of them!"

"Ick! Worms!" Margery shuddered, then giggled.
"I'm glad we're not getting any."

She could afford to be lighthearted, I thought, as I pushed open the gate to our front yard.

I didn't feel like answering her "Bye!" It sounded too cheerful, and my mind was on—

"Mama's got the worms!" Michael shouted before I got the door half open. He was on his way out with a piece of bread and jam in his hand, and of course he swung the door wide open.

"They're in the kitchen, want me to show 'em to you?"

How obnoxious!

"No, thank you." I felt my nose wrinkle; only a boy would be all excited over a bunch of worms!

"Shut the door, Michael!" I yelled, but he was gone.

All I could think of as I hesitated in the cool front room was Michael's vivid description at breakfast. The worms filled my mind's eye, crawling about the kitchen. Three inches long, Father had said, fat and white, with legs like caterpillars. I was near tears when I put those thoughts aside and started for the kitchen, where I could hear the reassuring rattle of Mama's dinner pans.

I set my books down carefully on Grandma's polished round table from England, and pushed open the kitchen door.

I stepped into the sunshine of the room and casually looked around. Mama stood at the stove; the woodpile was nicely stacked; the pantry door was ajar, and I could hear baby Sukey playing in there. Nervously, I let my eyes travel over the bright room.

There it was: an unfamiliar wooden box on the floor in the corner. I hurried to Mama.

"Mama, are there really worms in that box?"

Mother worked over her stove, with what seemed to be brave unconcern about the squirming, wriggling contents of the box in the corner. She smiled.

"Look and see for yourself." The box was covered, and I stared at it in the corner by the pantry for so long that Mama turned around from her pots. "Why, Sara, what is the matter?" "I don't want to look at them. They're crawling around in there, and they're ugly." Tears stung my eyelids, and I swallowed hard. Mama smiled again, and put down her big wooden stirring spoon. "Sara, do you know what silkworms are for?" "No." I shook my head, and stifled a sniff. "Those worms are going to work for us. They are going to make fine, soft threads that we can have woven into silk." Mother stroked one of my short, brown braids. "You know how soft and lovely silk ribbons are." I nodded. "Well, now we can make our own silk. When those caterpillars make their cocoons, you and I and maybe Margery Johnson will unwind the cocoon threads and spin them together, and they will be lovely silk threads! Then we'll get some silk ribbons woven from them. And if we want more worms next year, there will be more silk, enough to make a bonnet, and lovely lace hankies, or even a silk dress!" "A whole dress of silk?" I began to perk up and show a female interest. "Maybe. If those little worms work hard." Mama got up from her chair and moved toward the worm box. "Come and look at them now." "But they're not little." I hung back, remembering my sinking stomach. "They're fat, and squirmy." Mama had removed the cover of the box. Inside there seemed to be a lot of dark leaves, all cut up. "Come here, Sara." I moved slowly to the corner and peered into the open box. It seemed to contain nothing but the tangled mass of mulberry leaves. "Where are the worms?" "Look harder." There seemed to be a little laugh in Mama's voice. I looked harder. There did seem to be faint black specks on the leaves. And something certainly seemed to have eaten pieces of them. Then one of the little black specks moved! With my curious nose almost in the box, the speck showed itself to be—a silkworm! "There they are! I can barely see them! Michael said they were big and ugly!" I scarcely looked at Mama, but I'm sure there was some relief on her face. "I'm glad we don't have that kind. Ours look like little ants!" Mama smiled again. "They've just hatched from tiny eggs. I'm going to let you feed them, every day." "May I?" I couldn't take my eyes off the little specks. I was enchanted, not to say greatly relieved, by the smallness of the silkworms, and the fact that they were nothing like Michael's and Father's descriptions. "How do I feed them?" "I'll do it while you are at school. What you will have to do is gather mulberry leaves in the morning, afternoon, and evening, and put them in the box, broken up. Mind they're not damp. The worms will know what to do." "Eat and grow!" Michael burst into the kitchen. "Let's put the cover back on the box. It's so the spiders won't get in." "No, let me look at them some more." I looked dreamily back into the box, at my new little worms. "They're so little! They're not ugly at all." And my tiny, voracious worms just ate and ate.

IN THE SILENCE OF A ROOM

She goes about her daily tasks,
Dusting here and there;
No childish laughter at her door,
No light brown hair to brush and comb,
The window pane now shining bright—
No finger prints are there.
She sighs; her eyes grow moist,
The postman passes, the phone is silent,
No knock upon the door.
Then day is cupped
Within the shadows of the night.

She kneels, please bless my child,
She softly says Her room.
And silence fills—

Elena Powers sighed, pushed her glasses back upon her slightly tilted nose, and peered intently through the flying windshield wipers at the slick, black highway. Three trips to Virginia and still no trace of great-great-grandmother. "It's getting expensive, too," she muttered to herself, noting with annoyance cars streaking past her at speeds far too swift for safety. Water washed over the hood of the little car, danced on the highway's dark surface, contemptuously swished up from the tires of passing cars, and flooded the borrow pits now running with muddied streams. Ahead a huge white sign reminded the traveler of working highway taxes, a small diamond-shaped yellow _ sign urged caution, and behind that a pair of flickering scarlet lamps lit a detour sign.

"Let's put the cover back on the box. It's so the spiders won't get in."

"No, let me look at them some more." I looked dreamily back into the box, at my new little worms. "They're so little! They're not ugly at all." And my tiny, voracious worms just ate and ate.

In fact she had always believed that the bright blue and white pattern common ordinary grandmother did tell a story of a beautiful princess and a thwarted love, even of a flying bird that held her sweet spirit. "May I help you?" asked a tall, brisk saleswoman in a crisp cotton dress, not a bit like the drooping outdoors. Without meaning to, Elena studied her. Sharp black eyes like animated currants studied her in return. After a brief pause, Elena smiled quickly and asked courteously, "May I browse?" and then added with sharp interest, "what century willowware?" "Eighteenth. Would you like to look closer?" In no time the two of them were in warm conversation over crystal, willowware, and seventeenth century china. "Were you especially looking for glassware?" Elena laughed a little ruefully, catching her lower lip between her teeth, "No. Really, I'm looking for my great-great-grandmother!" "Does she live here?" the lady asked absently while she ran an inspecting finger over a silken lampshade. Then, glancing at Elena's amused face, she commented in embarrassment, "Oh, of course not, she would not be alive, would she?" With a smile, Elena turned back to the antiques and moved slowly through the crowded aisle. "Oh, what a lovely frame!" She held up a walnut framed picture and stared with admiration at its intricate design. "What a lot of talent and work went into that!" The frame held a family group picture with the family posed in front of a cabin—an old woman in a rocker in front of the group, a dog, and a riot of flowers at the side. She had seen dozens of such old photos, but the frame interested her. The tall, slim clerk, in her crisp cotton dress, waited expectantly. She probably didn't get many customers, Elena decided. There surely wasn't a detour off the main road into Evergreen every day. "I'll take it!" she said firmly. The frame was wrapped in brown paper and tied with gratitude Elena thought to herself as she placed the package into the seat beside her. Now for the cemetery! Promptly a frown made a furrow between her dark brows. She had forgotten to ask where it was! How forgetful of her! Ruefully she retraced her footsteps; almost as ruefully the tiny bell on the door of the antique shop sounded her return. "Back again!" Elena's smile met the clerk's own who looked up from her dusting to say in surprise, "May I help you?" "I'm sure you can!" Elena hesitated. "I feel rather foolish. I meant to ask you in the first place, but," she waved a hand, "these lovely old things helped me to forget. Can you tell me how to find the city cemetery?" The directions were given while the clerk dusted a row of flowered shaving mugs, each trimmed with a gold band or scalloped edge. "Still looking for grandmother?" the clerk's blackcurrant eyes softened and her voice was gentle. "Yes. Well at least a trace of her." Elena's blue eyes darkened with thought, but she thanked her cheerfully, and with the clerk's wish for good luck following her, she left the shop to the tinkle of the tiny bell. This time the matching figure in the store window did not turn to see a graying coiffure or rosetinted sweater. It was easy to find the cemetery. Bright flowers nestled close to native stone and round green shrubs nodded against gray marble. From the roadside to the knoll, the cemetery sloped gently away. It was easy too to tell the old part of the cemetery from the new. The old cemetery with its tilting crosses and weathered wooden foot markers was flush with the wrought iron gates while the new cemetery lay symmetrically to the north on the sloping hill. Elena lifted the rusting iron gate to release its catch and was soon walking between the grassy mounds, stepping gingerly almost reverently. She noted with tenderness the roses, the doves, the crosses, and the sweet words of everlasting devotion that were carved on rugged stone to show that someone cared. "Rogers, Sylvester, Johnson," Elena murmured the names softly as now and then she bent down to see the inscriptions more clearly. "Simpson, Wells," Elena made a mental note to tell Sister Stevens. Who knows? This might be the missing Wells that Sister Stevens needed to complete her first pedigree chart. The light green grass was drooping with the recent rain and she noted with chagrin dark stains on her white pumps. Oh well, she took a few mincing steps, wriggled her damp toes uncomfortably and then giggled softly—she would have something to take back to Ohio, if only a pair of soggy white pumps! But the giggle was only a fleeting thing in the midst of her meditation. "Shaw, Thompson, Baby Thompson—" tears brightened Elena's eyes. The tiny stone had been carved with flying cupids and delicate lilies, "Our Beloved Baby." Someone had truly cared. So engrossed was she that she was nearly past the stark white cross with green moss shading its inscribed surface when she saw the first four letters that followed the word, MOTHER, C-A-T-H. Quickly Elena knelt, snatched a file from her purse and with trembling excitement, began to scrape common ordinary grandmother the moss from the deeply etched letters. CATHERINE E-L-I-Z-A-B-E-T-H no wonder she had felt so exhilarated! The search was over! What a wondrous thing had happened! A rainy day, a detour to a little town, an obscure country cemetery in a green, green valley, and here it was! Small prayers of thankfulness mingled with excited breaths as even more swiftly Elena's excited fingers scraped the green moss from the corroded lettering. The full name was uncovered, but to Elena the words didn't make sense. For a moment she could only stare, disappointment a dull heavy thing settling in her chest. "Catherine Elizabeth Mathewson." She was hardly aware of the wet grass soaking through her skirt to her nylon covered knees, nor was she aware of the singular beauty of the white stone that she had cleared of moss. Finally with quivering hands resting on the stone she pushed herself to her feet. Absently she pushed the glasses back up on her nose. Well it was not right to lose her sense of humor over it. She had found one Catherine Elizabeth. With a toss of her head, she smiled almost shyly as she spoke aloud, "How many more of these will I find, Mother Mathewson, before I find Grandmother Nicholson?" Somehow the little cemetery had lost its enchantment. Now she knew without doubt that she wasn't going to find her great-great-grandmother here. Anyway hadn't Aunt Ila said that Grandmother Nicholson had passed away in the mountains some—where? Elena looked around her. How could she have forgotten that? This was scarcely mountainous country, not these gentle hills! How sad to go back to Ohio again without finding anything. She had spent three days this time. She had been all over Central Virginia and had uncovered nothing at all.

She remembered with a short laugh how the old mayor of one small town had said, "How do you know she's a Virginian anyway?" and before she could answer, he had flushed crimson with foreknowledge of what he knew she would say, then he had narrowed his twinkling eyes, assumed a sly expression, and had leaned close to her to say, "If she cooked with cinnamon she's a Northerner, but if she cooked with nutmeg, she's a Southern lady!" and then he had laughed till his old stomach had shook, and his eyes, lost in wrinkles, had been flooded with tears. Elena supposed it had been a good joke, but the difference between a Virginian cook and a New England chef didn't seem to be a fact that one could record on genealogy sheets. She decided as she left the peaceful cemetery that the biggest joke was that she had come to the wrong area. She was going to have to go, that's all there was to it. She was a small, sad figure passing through a rusty wrought iron gate whose clank she didn't hear for the deep sigh that escaped her. Bright sunshine had dissipated the clouds and even dried the puddles when Elena left the little town. "It was expensive!" she agreed to herself, but in a way, it felt as though the trip was already over and the heaviness of disappointment gave way to an unexplainable acceptance. "Oh, well, Great-great-grandmother Catherine, next year I'll give it another whirl!" Such a special person as dear, spirited Catherine could not just exist without a trace. Every year for the past three, she had flown into Virginia during the spring vacation and every year she had failed. The little car pressed the black highway under its wheels and whipped into Ohio in record time. There was time enough for Elena to get a good night's rest before going back to school. As she bathed, she meditated upon her present state of mind. In other years she had been despondent over her failure, why didn't she feel that way now? All she had done that was different was to take a detour into a country town, visit a cemetery in that same town, buy an unnecessary picture frame, and come home. That was it! Elena sat bolt upright in the tub, splashing warm, lazy bubbles over the white smooth edges. In her house coat now, with wet tendrils of hair clinging to her cheekbones stirred to a lovely rose by excitement, she fumbled with trembling fingers at the strings that held the brown paper about her picture frame. The old walnut frame slipped from the paper into Elena's disappointed view. Why it was ugly! What had she seen in it? And the people? They were just a common ordinary family that no one had cared enough about even to preserve their pictures. Still she couldn't just throw away $15, so she removed the picture to better look at the antiquated frame. It had probably hung on an unpeeled cabin wall with bits of drying bark falling on it now and then when an over-eager housewife cleaned the dusty log walls. The picture was out. Elena hurried to the wastebasket to throw away the yellow and cracked photo. "Oh! Writing on the back!" she spoke aloud to herself. They had cared enough to make note of who the old lady was and probably even the dog's name would be at the foot of the list. Or maybe even at the head? She was still laughing softly at her own observation when the words leaped out at her bright with power as a revelation from another world. Catherine Elizabeth Nicholson, John Earl Nicholson and his wife, Elaine, the year 1877. Tears scalded Elena's eyes and splattered her glasses. Common, Ordinary Grandmother so that she sat down with the old photo on her trembling lap and dabbed ineffectually at her streaming eyes. "Seek after the dead," the Lord had said. Elena ran a finger over the common, ordinary face of Catherine Elizabeth and found her suddenly beautiful. Just as suddenly, firmness was etched in the little woman's chin, and intelligence glowed in the large, dark eyes; a hand on his mother's shoulder revealed John Earl's respect for her. Great-great-grandmother Nicholson! The search was over! Years and ages recorded on the back of the photo made it all easy. For a moment, Elena was very still, her heart seemed to be listening intently while she pushed her glasses back up on her nose. Yes, God wanted the dead sought after and the hearts of the children turned to their forefathers. But who had been looking for whom? CR EASTER SONG I have come back along this path again To seek the quiet of these gold-trimmed trees, Whose black eroded roots and falling leaves Speak to my soul clear as a sculptured frieze. So, let me rest and muse, as trees grow bare And grieve for things I loved and cannot find Heart hunger for the lost and greening spring The summer growing of the ardent mind. I could not bear this golden loss that falls To fade and wither on the ground and stream Unless I knew there waits a singing day Another budding with a fairer dream. While breath shall last in me my faith be swift To know that spring will come—the dear Christ's gift. Linnie F. Robinson 221 Hobby Features Agnes J.

Podar Chapter 3 Synopsis: The night Jerusha was to spend with the Wilsons when her car broke down near their home has stretched into a permanent situation. She has been introduced to this new religion of theirs and is finding it interesting.

Her presence in the home has already manifested itself in many ways, some of which are obvious to everyone. Joe still resents her presence and Amy avoids contact with her. Both situations she is determined to change.

"‘He just didn't seem to be interested,’" Mrs. Johnson said, answering Jerusha's question regarding the Wilsons hiring a housekeeper. "Always said he thought they were getting along all right if anyone mentioned it to him." Jerusha chuckled. "I surely barged in and changed his mind, didn’t I?" "For which we're all very grateful," Ruth said, patting Jerusha's hand. "Oh, we did what we could," she genet A, helping the children with their clothes and taking food over once in awhile, inviting them to dinner." She paused a minute. "He’s quite independent. It’s difficult... "He needs a wife," Jerusha said. "He doesn’t seem to be interested in that either. Paul and Dorothy Wilson were very close." "But she's gone," Ruth said. "That's true," Ruth said, "for this life she's gone." Jerusha looked at her curiously. "Now that’s a peculiar remark." Ruth smiled. "I’ll explain it sometime," she said.

"If he isn’t interested in a wife himself," Jerusha continued, "maybe we could whet his interest a little." Ruth laughed. "You’re quite a person, Jerusha. Too bad you couldn't be his wife." 223 March 1970

"Nonsense!" Jerusha snorted. "I’m happy to be his mother."

At the Wilson farm she thanked her hostess warmly for the very pleasant day and started through the gate. But she caught a glimpse of Amy's pink dress as it disappeared behind the house by the willow tree. She stopped, her hand on the gatepost.

Summer would soon pass, and little Amy would be going to kindergarten. So much time would be lost to her each day to build a relationship. Somehow it seemed important that she not lose even a single day.

Skeeter came and rubbed himself against her legs. She patted his head, and the dog wagged his tail in appreciation for her attention, and looked up at her with his mellow and pleading eyes, asking for a romp. She picked up a stick and threw it toward the willow tree. The dog dashed after the stick which bounced off the trunk of the tree. She heard a tinkly little laugh as Skeeter, in his overeager excitement, yelped loudly.

Amy ran to his rescue. "Poor Skeeter," she said, patting his bruised head. "You didn’t look where you went." She sat down and pulled the dog down beside her with her arms about his scrubby body. Skeeter eased onto his haunches in a friendly manner, his breath coming in fast hot pants while his tongue went up and down over his teeth.

Amy bent her head down at an angle and looked solicitously into the dog's face. "What makes you do that, Skeeter?" she asked in an intimate tone.

Jerusha had covered the distance quietly and stood smiling down at the touching picture. "I think he’s saying it’s warm and his run made his breath come like that, so he hangs his tongue out to cool off," she said.

Amy ducked her head quickly into the dog's shaggy hair. Almost holding her breath in apprehension lest the child run, Jerusha slid down quietly onto the grass on the other side of the dog. "I think Skeeter likes you," she said, "he forgot all about the stick when you came to help him."

Amy turned her head just a little and peeked out over the dog's shaggy hair. "I like you, too, Amy," Jerusha said carefully, "I would like to be your friend like Skeeter is." For a breathless minute there was silence, only the dog’s audible breathing. Then Amy asked, with her eyes still peeking over the hair, "Are you Skeeter's friend?"

Jerusha's heart swelled. "Yes," she said, still a little warily. "Skeeter and I are the best friends in the world!"

Amy pulled her head slowly out of the dog's hair. "I'm glad you're my friend," she said.

Jerusha's heart beat a happy tattoo on her ribs. Carefully, oh, so carefully, she reached over and touched the child’s golden hair. Amy did not draw away.

"I'll tell you what," Jerusha said, "let's you and I go make some cookies. And we’ll make a big fat one with a funny face on it for Skeeter." Amy laughed, a tinkling little elfin laugh that was music to Jerusha’s ears. "Oh, goody!" she cried clapping her hands. "Can I make the big fat cookie for Skeeter?" "Indeed you may!" Jerusha sang, taking the small hand in hers and beaming with moist eyes. "And you may feed it to him, too!"

"If we had some paint," Jerusha said to Paul one morning as he happened by the kitchen for a drink of water while she was sifting flour into the pan for breadmaking, "I would see if I could get Joe to paint the house and fence." Paul looked at her quickly with interest. "I’ve been thinking that they need a new look to match the rest of the things getting spruced up around here," he said. "I just noticed something’s happened to the couch. I’ll get the paint."

He hesitated. "But, do you think I’d better ask Joe to do it?" Jerusha set the sifter down. "Please don’t," she said. "I would like him to do the painting because I asked him to." She stood silent for a minute with her eyes fastened on the flour sifter, and then she added significantly, "Even if it takes the rest of the summer."

A slow smile of understanding spread over Paul’s face. "Of course," he said. "I’ll get the paint when I go into town this afternoon." He looked at the glass in his hand thoughtfully. "I’d like to ask for something else," Jerusha said frankly. He looked at her curiously, "Yes?"

"Suzey's growing so fast, most of her clothes are lagging behind. If I had some material, I could get her ready for school." Paul set the glass on the cupboard. He turned to her humbly. "Jerusha," he said, his eyes misty, his fine honest face touched with Jerusha Spends the Night emotion, "I’m sure your car broke down on purpose before our gate. We needed you so much."

"Well, that’s a right pleasant thought, Paul Wilson," she said. "Now, how about some cloth for your daughters? I might just as well make Amy some dresses, too. You realize, of course, she goes to kindergarten this year?"

"Tell you," he said, a sudden burst of buoyancy about him she had not noticed before. "Why don’t the three of you come with me and get whatever you need?" Jerusha looked at the pan of flour. "Splendid idea! I’ll just save this breadmaking for tomorrow."

It was a wonderful afternoon. Little Amy clung to her hand like a leech. Since Amy had finally accepted her, Jerusha found the little girl by her side constantly. All the hidden hunger for the mother she had been denied seemed to bloom out in acceptance of her newly found friend.

And Jerusha, an emptiness in her own life she had never known existed for this relationship, welcomed the child with open arms. They made cookies together, sewed clothes for her doll, and took walks down the lane or through the fields. At night Jerusha held the little girl on her lap and told her fantastic fairy stories with charming interpretation so that she giggled with delight. 'Tell me about the Clippety-Clackety-Clop Man," Amy would say. And Jerusha would stroke her golden head and begin. And it never came out just the same way twice. She would say, "Once upon a time... Sometimes she caught him staring at her sullenly, even almost belligerently when he didn't know she saw. "He thinks I'm some old coot," she said to herself, "come to push the family around." She paused and thought it over. "Maybe I am," she said half aloud, "but I'll not give up yet!" Then, one day while she was working with the roses, she looked up to see Joe standing against the willow tree watching her. The straggly overgrown rose bed had become a thing of beauty now. All the remainder of June it had put on its bloom in appreciation of the care given it. And even now in the hot July sun, there were still a few showy blossoms. When she looked up and met his gaze, he turned and left, walking toward the barn. She worked on quietly for awhile, thinking. Then she clipped off a beautiful Peace rose and carried it with her toward the barn, concocting some errand that might take her there. She came around the corner of the building and stopped short. Joe was leaning against the barn smoking a cigarette. He jerked it from his mouth and turned on her angrily. "Snoopin'!" he cried, his dark eyes flashing. "Now I guess you'll go tattlin'!" Jerusha gathered her wits quickly. She had been to church enough to know smoking was not looked upon with good will, and she was sure it would be very disconcerting to his father. "Oh," she said calmly, ignoring the discourteous accusation and also the cigarette, "I have nothing to tell. That would be your Jerusha Spends the Night business. I was just coming for a fresh egg to put in the cake." She paused and looked at the rose in her hand, trying desperately to ease the strained atmosphere. "Have you noticed how lovely the roses are?" she asked casually. His belligerence seemed a little confused. "I guess you think you can wrap me around your finger like the rest of them!" he said irritably. "No," she conceded, "I don't believe I could wrap you around my finger at all. You have too much pride for that." She hesitated. "I... I just had an idea you might want to use some of that spunky pride to paint the fence and house with." He turned on her then, and she saw the fire she had imagined the first day. "There you go trying to bribe me! What'd you come here for anyway? We were doing all right. Why don't you leave?" Jerusha thought that one over a minute. "Well," she said thoughtfully, "if I did, I would be leaving unfinished something I started." There was just the hint of a smile. "You know, Joe, you could have fun in this new adventure, if you'd just let yourself. And it won't last forever. Things never do, because there are new ones that come along to take their places." Angrily he turned to leave. "Don't try to preach to me!" And he strode away arrogantly around the barn. Jerusha heaved a sigh. "Well," she said aloud to the barn, "I guess there'll be no painting today." (To be continued)

There were fifty-five home-sewn fashions made by the sisters, ranging from casual wear to formal attire. The evening was climaxed by the modeling of nine lovely wedding gowns and Cinderella marrying her prince.

"Elizabeth Clyburn is Relief Society president of the Eighth Ward."

Lesson Department HOMEMAKING Development Through Homemaking Education Woman's Role in Family Preparedness Discussion

"He That Gathereth in Summer Is a Wise Son: But He That Sleepeth in Harvest Is a Son That Causeth Shame." (Prov. 10:5.)

Celestia J. Taylor Northern Hemisphere: Second Meeting, June 1970 Southern Hemisphere: Second Meeting, November 1970

OBJECTIVE: To point out to the Latter-day Saint woman appropriate utilization of available foods.

INTRODUCTION Are we among those who subscribe to the philosophy that "the world owes us a living" or that there is real merit in getting "something for nothing"? Widespread among the peoples of the world today are various ideas such as these which, if we espouse them, undermine our self-reliance and jeopardize our ability to take care of ourselves. If we are mature and realistic in our thinking, we will know that life is not easy, that we must, in reality, earn our bread by the sweat of our brow, as the words of the scriptures tell us. We will know that we cannot rely or depend on others to take care of us and our families in time of need, but that we must put forth every effort to be self-sustaining in any eventuality.

The following words of President Brigham Young are just as applicable today as they were when he spoke them: "My faith does not lead me to think the Lord will provide us with roast pigs, bread already buttered, etc. He will give us the ability to raise the grain, to obtain the fruits of the earth, to make habitations and when harvest comes, giving us the grain, it is for us to preserve it—to save the wheat until we have one, two, five, or seven years' provisions on hand, until there is enough of the staff of life saved by the people to bread themselves and those who will come here seeking for safety. Will you do this? 'Aye, maybe I will,' says one, and 'maybe I won't,' says another.

'... The Lord has said it is His business to provide for His Saints, and I guess He will do it.' I have no doubt but He will provide for His Saints, but if you do not take this counsel and be industrious and prudent, you will not long continue to be one of His Saints—."

SOW, plant, buy half a bushel of wheat here, and a bushel there, and store it up till you get your five or seven years' provisions on hand.

(Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses, Vol. 10, pp. 293-94 [hereafter referred to as JD].)

AVAILABILITY OF FOODS Our families have been encouraged to preserve seasonal foods—fruits, vegetables, grains, and nuts—when they are abundant, by home preservation methods. These foods can be made available in the following ways:

I. By planting gardens at home whenever possible.
Z. By participating in home and/or group canning.
3. By purchasing from farmers, fruit growers, and markets when seasonal fruits and vegetables are plentiful.
By fishing and hunting in season.
By drying excess supplies of driable fruits and vegetables—prunes, apples, pears, apricots, corn, peas, etc.

PROPER UTILIZATION OF FOODS

To maintain high quality in home-stored foods, the following recommendations are made:

1. In storing wheat, the General Church Welfare Committee has recommended that dark hard winter wheat of a good grade with a moisture content of 10% or below should be obtained. (Methods of preparation and storage are readily available.)

2. The initiation of a rotation plan for stored foods is advisable to insure against spoilage. (Cans, jars, and packages should be dated.)

3. All stored food should be kept away from continual exposure to light and stored in a dry, cool, but well above freezing temperature.

Fruits, vegetables, and meats properly processed in glass jars will keep in a cool, dark, dry place fully as long as canned goods.

4. Root vegetables such as potatoes, carrots, turnips and cabbage, and fruits such as apples and winter pears can be stored in cool cellars with dirt floors or in properly ventilated pits or bins.

5. Dried foods—beans, peas, rice, etc.—should be sealed in airtight containers for best keeping.

6. In storing powdered milk, the dry non-fat or skim milk is preferable, as it is less expensive than whole milk, has all the nutritive values of whole milk (except the fat), and will store much longer—approximately three to five years if kept dry at 40 degrees F.; one to two years under higher temperatures not exceeding 70 degrees.

7. Sugar, honey, and other sweeteners will last indefinitely if stored under the proper conditions.

CONCLUSION

There should be no reason for any of us to be unaware of our responsibilities or for our failure to properly utilize available foods. Even those who live under what might be termed adverse climactic conditions can, with the proper adjustments and adaptations, work out a successful, or at least an adequate food preparation program. All families may find help and suggestions in our discussions which will alleviate some of their problems.

Valuable suggestions are available and many have been given by those who have made a careful study of the emergency needs of our families—the directors of the General Church Welfare Program, the extension services of our universities, the United States Department of Agriculture and of Health, Education and Welfare; our civil defense programs, and other organizations and individuals who are concerned with our welfare. These have all been consulted in the preparation of our homemaking discussions.

Since storage conditions differ in geographical areas, State extension bulletins should be consulted for accurate information about the best local storage practices. Storage fads may be avoided by consulting these sources.

AD HAPPINESS

Happiness is many things,
Both inborn and acquired.
It comes to him who seeks it least
Self-sacrifice inspired.
It dwells in every humble heart,
Finds room with troubled care.
Soon chases out depression, doubt,
And conquers all despair.
