The February Magazine is an especially excellent issue. I have tried the sourdough
recipes (by Edythe K. Watson) and my family thoroughly enjoys them. I especially enjoyed
the address by Queen Halaevalu Mata'aho of Tonga� "Weaving the Fabric of
Home Life." The essay "The Creek Taught Me," by Anny M. Campbell had a meaning
for me also, for we had a similar experience that seemed to bring our family closer
together. I read several of the articles to my husband and we have shared the ideas
presented in the February Magazine. Barbara L. Oliphant, Ivins, Utah

The article "Always Set a Good Table" (by Betty Jan Murphy) in the January Magazine
really hit home with me. Sometimes my table has been looking like the one with the
carton of milk, ketchup bottle, etc. Since reading the article I have made an "all-out"
effort to make my table as attractive as possible. Aside from my family's compliments,
I have been surprised to see the hundred per cent improvement in my seven-year-old's
table manners, and a more relaxed atmosphere at the dinner table.
Fran Pacifico, Parkside, Pennsylvania

I love the lessons, stories, poems, homemaking ideas, pictures, and recipes featured in
the Magazine. Sometimes I am tempted to cut some of the recipes out when I don't
have time to copy them� but that would spoil the Magazine which I want to keep
nice looking. Mrs. Verna K. Johnson, Idaho Falls, Idaho

The Magazine comes to me as a gift from a dear friend, Mrs. Nancy Anderson of
Norwalk, California. Every issue is just wonderful from cover to cover. The articles,
stories, and poems are inspiring; the art layouts and illustrations are delightful. Many
of the recipes have become family favorites. Most precious to me, though, are the
lessons. I am not a member of your Church, but four of our seven children are active
and enthusiastic Latter-day Saints. It is my constant and fervent prayer that some
day it will be possible for the rest of my family, including myself, to be baptized into
the Church. Beth Raehl, Larsen, Wisconsin

The February issue of the Magazine has just been most carefully and eagerly read�
and what wonderful things I found to feed my soul. The words of wisdom from the
Queen of Tonga were so beautifully expressed and so true. I was thrilled to read her
words and wondered why I had never heard the relationship in the home expressed
before in just this simple and forceful way. Thank you also for adding my poem
("On Priorities") at the end of the article. It was a real honor to me.
Mabel Gabbott, Bountiful, Utah

How happy I was to read the article written by Sister Tuddenham about "Granny"
in the October Magazine. It brought back such lovely memories of our association with
her and the sisters of the Cairns Branch of the Australian Mission. I remember the
very evening the dance was given. Each branch had prepared a number to bring
to the district conference for a Saturday evening performance. What a hit Granny
made with her "troupe." We all learned to love Granny.
Taurine A. Ensign, Fresno, California

What a wonderful message to wives and mothers is given in the February Magazine
by the Queen of Tonga, Halaevalu Mata'aho. Surely her husband must love her very
much. Thanks to the sisters who work in the worthwhile endeavors that help countless
women the world over. Goodie L. Stark, Pocatello, Idaho

Please send me The Relief Society Magazine. I am not of your faith, but I do enjoy
the stories, recipes, and the ideas each month. I have been reading Mary Beagley's
Magazines, so I am sure I shall enjoy the ones of my own subscription, and I will
pass them on to my neighbors. Mrs. Donald Fitch, Travis A.F.B., California

243 President Joseph Fielding Smith Called to Be Tenth President of the Church January 23, 1970

After a lifetime of dedicated and devoted service to the Church, President Joseph Fielding Smith has been set apart to be the President of the Church. He has served as an apostle since 1910, and has visited the stakes of the Church in turn by whitetop, by automobile, by train, by ship, and by airplane. This great responsibility has come to President Smith with a rich background of experience and a meaningful heritage.

His grandfather, Hyrum Smith, was martyred at Carthage, Illinois, with his brother, the Prophet Joseph Smith. His father was the sixth President of the Church, President Joseph F. Smith. President Smith has been an adviser from the Council of the Twelve to the General Board of Relief Society since 1944. He has always been ready and willing to fulfill that assignment.

It has been a privilege over the years to accompany new board members to his office to have them set apart. President Smith's blessings have revealed the deep feeling he has toward Relief Society, and his acceptance and understanding of Relief Society in the lives of the women of the Church. Its divine birth and the blessing it is to the souls of men characterize the content of his blessings.

President Smith's mother, Julina Lambson Smith, served nineteen years on the Relief Society General Board and was a Counselor in the General Presidency of Relief Society under President Clarissa S. Williams. While Julina Smith's husband, President Joseph F. Smith, was President of the Church, the Temple Clothing Department for the Church was assigned to the General Board of Relief Society and established and developed under her direction and watchcare.

President and Sister Smith have often traveled together as he fulfilled conference assignments, and they are beloved throughout the Church.

President Joseph Fielding Smith Called to Be Tenth President

President Smith's first wife was Louise Emylia Shurtliff, who was the mother of two daughters: Mrs. Henry (Josephine) Reinhardt and Mrs. Elden C. (Julina) Hart. She died in 1908. By his second wife, Ethel Georgina Reynolds, he had five sons and four daughters: Joseph Fielding, Jr., George Reynolds, Douglas A., Milton E., Lewis W., who was killed during World War II, Mrs. L. Garrett (Emily) Myers, Mrs. Hoyt W. (Naomi) Brewster, Mrs. Bruce R. (Amelia) McConkie, Mrs. William S. (Lois) Fife.

Sister Ethel Smith served fourteen years as a member of the General Board of Relief Society and died in 1937. His third wife, Jessie Ella Evans, took over the care of his large family and devotedly upholds and supports President Smith in all his daily activities. Sister Jessie Evans Smith has been generous in the service she has given and in her rich talents which she has shared in the interest of Relief Society.

Much inspiration and enlightenment have come to Relief Society members throughout the world through studying the addresses which President Smith has delivered for many years at the Relief Society Annual General Conferences. His kindly and considerate character has tempered the directions, admonitions, and warnings which he has given as an apostle of the Lord to his daughters.

In 1952, President Smith was unable to deliver his annual message to Relief Society at the Relief Society Annual General Conference. Elder Matthew Cowley was asked that morning to speak in his place. We are indebted to Elder Cowley for this evaluation of President Smith which will find an echo in the hearts of Relief Society members everywhere: I want to say that I have never met a more kindly, more considerate, more loving man in all my life than President Joseph Fielding Smith. He is one of the most loving characters I have ever been associated with, and I trust that God will give him strength and a long life to continue his great mission here on earth in delivering his powerful discourses to the children of Zion. (The Relief Society Magazine, January 1953, p. 6.)

Relief Society members have studied over the years some of the works of President Smith. The Way to Perfection and The Progress of Man brought much enlightenment to the sisterhood and Essentials in Church History has been a reference book for many courses. President Smith's daughters have served as Relief Society stake presidents. Their home lives have reflected the virtues to be found in a priesthood-directed home which has a Relief Society mother. The Relief Society members throughout the world are blessed to have Relief Society go forward under the guidance of President Joseph Fielding Smith, who is filled with that charity which never faileth.

President Harold B. Lee Called As First Counselor to President Smith January 23, 1970

@ Relief Society sisters throughout the world rejoice at the appointment of Elder Harold B. Lee to become First Counselor to President Joseph Fielding Smith in the First Presidency of the Church as of January 23, 1970. President Lee has served as an adviser to Relief Society from the Council of the Twelve since 1963. He has a thorough understanding of the work of Relief Society and has given invaluable advice to the General Presidency over the years. He was called to the Council of the Twelve in April 1941, and becomes the senior member of that body with the calling of President Smith as the prophet, seer, and revelator of the Church.

President Lee has been prominent in the organization and administration of the Church Welfare Program, and since 1960 has served as general chairman of the Church Correlation Program. President Lee was born in Clifton, Idaho, March 28, 1899, one of six children of Samuel Marion and Louisa Emeline Bingham Lee. He was reared in Cache Valley, Idaho, on a farm and received his education at Oneida Stake Academy and Albion Normal School where he received a teaching certificate. At the age of seventeen he was teaching and serving as principal of a small school in Southern Idaho. His own school activities were varied and interesting. He played in the school band, on the basketball team, was a debater, and played in an orchestra.

In November 1920, he was called to labor as a missionary in the Western States Mission. Following his mission he took up residence in Salt Lake City and attended the University of Utah. On November 14, 1923, President Lee was married to Fern Lucinda Tanner in the Salt Lake Temple. They had two daughters, Helen Lee Goates, and Maurine Lee Wilkins, who passed away in 1966. There are ten grandchildren.

Sister Lee, a member of the General Board of the Primary, sustains President Lee in every calling.

ANAS AE AREA INE CA 8 AEE SEIS | Rr rite niece me President Spencer W. Kimball to Serve As Acting President of the Council of the Twelve @ With the naming of President Harold B. Lee, senior member of the Council of the Twelve, to the First Presidency, Elder Spencer Woolley Kimball has been named acting President of the Council of the Twelve.

President Kimball is a noteworthy speaker, especially among the younger members of the Church. He was ordained to the apostleship and sustained as a member of the Council of the Twelve in October of 1943, and has devoted his life since that time to being a special witness of Jesus Christ.

President Kimball was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, March 28, 1895, one of eleven children of Andrew and Olive Woolley Kimball. One of his grandfathers, Heber C. Kimball, was a Counselor to President Brigham Young. His heritage is rich in devoted Church service.

He was educated in the public schools and Gila Academy at Thatcher, Arizona, and at the University of Arizona. He has an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from Brigham Young University.

President Kimball served a three-year mission in the Central States Mission, finishing his mission as a district president. Upon completion of his mission he returned to Arizona, where he met and married Camilla Eyring, November 17, 1918, in the Arizona Temple. They are the parents of three sons and one daughter: Mrs. Grant M. (Olive Beth) Mack, Spencer L., Andrew, and Edward Lawrence.

There are twenty-seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

President Kimball has traveled widely among the Indians. He has been a delegate to national and international meetings in behalf of the Lamanites. Church members throughout the world will benefit from Elder Kimball's zeal and devotion to his new calling.

@ The boy had the pallor of one who is indoors too much; he was pudgy, slow moving, and somewhat effeminate in mannerisms. Even his fingers were pink and clean, giving no hint of the grime.

Which usually comes with the rough and tumble activity common to most twelve-year-old boys. He was the only child of a widow who had showered him with attention and had clung to him for comfort following the death of her husband when the boy was young. The lad had been a frequent topic of anxious conversation between the bishop of his ward and the scoutmaster, both of whom felt he needed to be encouraged to form friends with other boys his age, and engage in activities provided for them. How could it best be accomplished? Scouting As a Preparation for Leadership President Belle S. Spafford A week's summer camping trip with the scout troop seemed a logical beginning, but the mother was sure her little boy could not endure the rigors of such an experience. Patient reassurance from the bishop and scoutmaster that extra care would be given him finally allayed her fears to the point she reluctantly gave permission for the boy to go. It was now the scoutmaster's turn to worry—with thirty other boys to watch over, how could he do justice to this one who needed so much individual attention? The answer was found in the person of one sixteen-year-old Eagle Scout who volunteered to serve as a big brother to the younger boy. All during the week the Eagle carefully taught the Tenderfoot the wonders of nature, the freedom and exhilaration of the out-of-doors, the pleasure of developing physical dexterity, the joy of learning new skills, and of being one of the boys. According to those relating this experience, that camping trip with its opportunity for peer association and the special attention of the older scout was the turning point for the boy—it headed him toward manhood and helped his mother to recognize his need to be free to mature. Was scouting important in the life of this boy? Those who knew him said emphatically, "yes." One day not so many months ago two Relief Society leaders stood on a shabby street in the heart of one of the most dismal and hopeless ghettos in New York City. They had been escorted there by several national leaders of the Boy Scouts of America in order to observe a troop unit in action in that setting. The hour was the closing time for the school located at the top of an incline in the street upon which they stood. All of a sudden, a flood burst out onto the street—not of water but of children who came scuffling and tumbling from the school. As this wave of humanity came down the street threatening to engulf the two women and their hosts, it began disappearing, as if by magic. The children were absorbed into the poor, dilapidated buildings. In a few minutes here and there, one would see their little faces appear at the dingy windows high above the street. 2 The two Relief Society women were escorted inside the "troop shack," a somewhat utilitarian, ground floor room furnished with large tables, some benches, and shelving which seemed to hold unnumbered attractions for boys—books, arts and craft supplies, ropes, and other scout materials. The two women listened intently as the Puerto Rican scoutmaster for the area described in broken English the activities of his troop and the national scout leaders correlated these with the Scouting As a Preparation for Leadership overall goals of scouting. The latter explained that it was a hope of the Boy Scouts of America to penetrate deeply into poverty areas where riots, crime rates, drug abuse seem to escalate, so that boys may be strengthened in mind and body in preparation for responsible citizenship. As this dialogue continued, into the room a number of boys began to filter and as they came, they began activities with which they were obviously familiar. Among them was a young Puerto Rican boy clasping in his arms a small violin. With him was his mother. They had come to share with the scoutmaster the good news that the boy had been selected to learn to play the violin at school with the hope, in time, of playing in the school orchestra. It was evident they considered the scoutmaster a friend who would share their excitement at this good news. Was scouting significant to that boy and to his neighborhood? Vitally! I was one of the two Relief Society women involved in this account, having been invited to the national headquarters of the Boy Scouts of America not only because of my Relief Society position but also by reason of the large numbers of women with whom I am affiliated as President of the National Council of Women of the United States. The Boy Scouts of America leaders desired that I receive orientation regarding the scouting program, its goals and long-range plans, with the end in view of bringing these to the attention of women and of urging closer ties with the BSA, particularly by mothers having sons served by scouting. Our hosts explained that too many mothers both in the ghettos and across America are content to enroll their sons in scouting and send them off to scout meetings with confidence that it is a safe place for the boys to spend their time. Scouting cannot be completely successful without mothers becoming more aware of the purposes of the organization—so said our hosts. As was stated in a pamphlet published by BSA in 1969 entitled "Boy Power—Man Power," scouting wishes to be a co-partner with "families and institutions of the nation to help prepare a new generation with the skill and confidence to master the changing demands of America's future and prepare to give leadership to it." (BSA Pamphlet: "Boy Power—Man Power," 1969, p. 5) Those leaders who form the underpinning of scouting—in America are men of character, of integrity, of great vision, and dedication. They are men of faith who have deep moral convictions; they are innovative and courageous—a truly moving, effective force for good in our nation! I am convinced that the program, the goals, the purposes, and the Boy Scouts of America are worthy of the active support and involvement of women everywhere. Scouting is far more than a recreational program with emphasis on physical fitness—it is a great social movement motivated by high-purposes and goals. BE LATE A LITTLE Let spring be late this year; let it delay Its coming, its singing, surging throb, its heady Greening under, over... Just one more day Be late. Tomorrow, maybe I'll be ready. Too much of hurt in me would seek the dark, Would hide a little longer all my tears, Would turn from spring, from song of meadowlark, To grieve my broken dream, to stay my fears. And yet the new grass covers winter's theft Where: searing frost broke continuity, And cleansing sunshine burns out all alloy; Perhaps the spring will heal where I'm bereft, Renew self-faith, repair inadequacy; Oh, spring, wait, just till I can bear your joy.

257 First � AFTERGLOW Virginia Maughan Kammeyer Pastoral Do you remember how the summer Stayed; and does it seem to you that it was always afternoon? The apple trees were bathed in amber light and emerald shade that timeless June. The loaded carts reeled down the freckled lane, and we would run behind them, kicking velvet dust, and watch as bursting loads were forked and thrust into tall stacks. Do you recall? The heavy-headed roses touched their lips to the cool porches where we liked to pass, and there were violets scattered in the grass beneath the many-fingered pine and fir— At least, I think there were. And after, when the day was lavender, and little insects played a fiddle string, and Eypsy moths flew round our heads on creamy wing, then do you recollect how we would sing? Pathétique Where are they gone—the hollyhocks we plucked to fashion into dolls, the golden fruit we sucked? Where are the roses, once incarnadine— the fingers that encircled yours and mine? Green mound, green mound, where summer rain is spread, the autumn frost, the winter's cumbrous snow— Where are the occupants of the dark bed? Is there another, near, sun-lit reality, where kind winds blow? Fugue Do children somewhere play at hide-and-seek? (Those that seek me Carly shall find me.) Are there moon-lilies by a pasture gate? (Consider the lilies of the field how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin.) (The pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being paved with love.)

258 VIRGINIA MAUGHAN KAMMEYER (author of "Afterglow," First Prize Poem) I deeply appreciate having been chosen first prize winner in the Relief Society Poem Contest. Thank you so much for this honor. As for facts about myself: I live with my husband, Fred Kammeyer, in Alderwood Manor, just north of Seattle, Washington. We have six children. A daughter is attending Ricks College, and a son is on a mission in Germany. I teach in Relief Society and in the Mutual Improvement Association, and am a member of the National League of American Penwomen. The Relief Society Magazine, The Instructor, and The Improvement Era have been kind enough to publish my articles, stories, and poems. A series of my humorous poems under the title "Life Among the Mormons," ran for thirteen months in the Era. I wrote "Afterglow" for my children to let them know how it used to be for my sisters, brothers, and cousins to remember—and for my mother for very special reasons.

259 Second � POEM WINDS OF SAN JUAN Hazel Loomis To you | came, Arms wet with longing, With father, mother, children all In youthing roots Set down to grow. A stripling orchard— House, resin weeping from its wood, A stair (my harp to play upon) And from its topmost rung, A sudden room—world large— For dark came early There. Mother, our evening star, climbed And there the wool of night was soft and deep And with the windward stream of wild plum blooms We knelt our whispered praise. Awake. And | was pitted with the sod! The work of blade and ditches, books, and barns. The always mother singing—sewing, The always father fencing—planning, The always Zion in their visioned gaze. The river of my days probed deep The milk of your prophetic earth And from the jigging—jogging Friday dance Into remembered Saturday of time, Then in the sable warmth of Sabbath | stood with you on holy ground! The vigor of your wind is hot upon my face My blood runs crimson as your oak And goes sledding on your crystal winter night. I shall not weep at death Or dying of the light. For I have viewed The resurrection of your dawn. I come to you with dew From off the high hill's planting. I bring my tithe (would gladly give my all). Take me, oh, gentle wind, to that hallowed upper room, Wash me again in spikenard Of wild plum bloom!

260 HAZEL LOOMIS (Author of "Winds of San Juan," Second Prize Poem) A prize poem in a commercial contest sparked off my literary endeavors. One of my plays written for Frederick Koch's class at the University of Michigan was produced at the university. I have written many articles and reviews, as well as stories and poems, especially during my teaching years in Casper, Wyoming. Several years ago, after residential transfer to New Jersey: I reviewed concerts and operas for newspapers and magazines in that area. I have written travel articles on my experiences in Africa and the Holy Land. My husband has been my best critic and sponsor. Held various positions in ward and stake organizations. Two grandsons, Eric and Andrew, have joyfully added abundance of love to the family circle.

Beginning in 1954, many of my writings have appeared in The Relief Society Magazine, including the Second Prize Poem, January 1962. "Apples of Gold" Alice Morrey Bailey

A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver - (Proverbs 25:11)

Words fitly spoken have rolled
Like filling bushels into my mind's hold
Since my remembering.
Patient teachers of the book and rule,
Of sky and stone and sea have been my school,
Beloved masters of the Word my staves of strength.
Wide leaves of books have spread for my delight.
The statesman's lofty phrase describes my freedom.
I have been wooed with vowel words of wine
And heard the petalled syllables of children.
Sages have burrowed the roots of my wisdom,
Poets have borne me on the boughs
Of loveliness.

Since my remembering
My father's praise has budded my young ego and girded my treasure,
And the sweet-cider words of my mother's loving
Have hugged me to safety, swelling
My measure
Filling the silver pictures of my days
With apples of gold.
262 ALICE MORREY BAILEY (author of "Apple of Gold," Third Prize Poem)

One of the highlights of my life was the invitation to represent all Relief Society Magazine writers and Wells Stake (Salt Lake City, Utah) in an exhibit of the theme 'The Relief Society Magazine encourages creative writing,' at the October 1969 Relief Society Annual General Conference, appropriately so, as I am one of the many writers who have received encouragement from the Magazine.

I was born in the small town of Joseph, Utah, to John F. And Laura Rawlinson Morrey. My husband, R. DeWitt Bailey, and I have three children, fourteen grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. I am at present organist for the Singing Mothers of Whittier Ward, teacher trainer in the Sunday School, and editor of the Ward Bulletin. I am retired after twenty years as a Relief Society trained nurse-aid, six years as a cartographer for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and twenty years as a secretary-draftsman at the University of Utah. I am now a free-lance writer and sculptor, and am also very much involved in genealogical work. I am vice-president of the Utah State Poetry Society, member of the National Federation of State Poetry Societies, the Utah Sonneteers, League of Utah Writers, and the Associated Utah Artists, former member of the League of American Penwomen, and have spent fourteen years as a member of the Utah State Institute of Fine Arts, having been appointed by three successive governors to represent sculpture.

263 EDITORIAL/ The Family Home Evening

"You shall set in order your own house." (D&C 93:43.)

In the early days of the Church, as recorded in the 93d Section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord found it necessary to reprove "Frring ones, even though in high authority in the Church." He placed them under condemnation saying, "You have not taught your children light and truth, according to the commandments; and that wicked one hath power, as yet, over you, and this is the cause of your affliction." To several, including even the Prophet, he stated "And now a commandment I give unto you you shall set in order your own house." "What I say unto one, I say unto all" the Lord declared. As Latter-day Saints we firmly believe that the Lord speaks to us from the pages of scriptures, that, in speaking unto one he speaks unto all. He has found it necessary in these days to speak unto all through his prophets, the message, "You shall set in order your own house."

As always when a commandment is given, a way is prepared through which it can be fulfilled. One excellent and approved way of setting our house in order is the Family Home Evening. Parents are commanded to teach their children (D&C 68) and the Lord further counsels "... That little children also may receive instruction before me as Is pleasing unto me." (D&C 55:4.) Wise, indeed, are parents who have initiated this practice while their children are small. It is now believed that the ages from two to five are the most important in the learning process. President McKay taught that children have established their most lasting habits before they are seven. The Lord has established the age of eight as the age of accountability. It follows, therefore, that the earlier the Family Home Evening becomes a family habit, the more impressive are the teachings of parents.

One of the great commandments, "Honour thy father and thy mother," is both a commandment and a responsibility. Responsibility lies with parents who endeavor to make themselves worthy of being honored by their children. Responsibility also lies with children to accept the guidance of parents. This relationship has its roots in family closeness which is fostered by the Family Home Evening program of the Church.

So often we hear that some young people are losing respect for the older generation. Learning to respect parents and honor their teachings may come when children are convinced that father and mother know what they are talking about. A child who grows up knowing that his parents can and will answer his questions, take time to listen to him, and show love for him, will have respect ingrained in his character.

Parents and children need to open their hearts to each other. Fortunate is the family which finds the time and opportunity to do so. The Family Home Evening, with its program of gospel instruction, participation by every member of the family, involvement in learning together, building each other, satisfying the need of each for recognition and love, is divinely inspired.

The women of Relief Society should be diligent proponents of the Family Home Evening.

Ramona W. Cannon Mrs. Sophie Leavitt, well-to-do mother of three adult children and author of a gourmet cookbook, learned that many welfare recipients were dumping their government-issue flour, dried milk, and other supplies. As a volunteer, she went around demonstrating to poverty-stricken wives how to make zesty meat and rice dishes, biscuits, cornbread and many other tasty items from government commodities. She talked on the radio and demonstrated for educational television.

Her recipes now appear in cookbooks passed out to welfare recipients. This generous volunteer has transformed the lives of many women on welfare, handicapped by lack of knowledge and training. Portia Nelson paints, sings, plays the piano, coaches singers, writes lyrics, music and dramatic scripts for television and moving pictures. She has also been highly praised as an actress by eminent critics. She attributes her versatility to her childhood activities in a Latter-day Saint home and community on a ranch eighty miles north of Salt Lake City. "Mormons believe you learn by doing, so their children get up and say a piece, or sing or play an instrument," says Miss Nelson. Dr. Mina Rees, who became a mathematician "because it was fun," has now been chosen the first woman president-elect of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. This is the largest scientific society in the United States. She also heads the graduate division of the University of New York. 266 Dr. Rita Hauser, thirty-four, of New York City, mother of two small children, is an international lawyer, linguist, and political economist. She and her husband, Gustave M. Hauser, were the first scholars sent from the United States to France in a new comparative law program sponsored by the Ford Foundation. Dr. Hauser believes dissent among college students, when nonviolent, is healthy, but it should be confined to ideas of genuine value to society. Under those conditions students should be listened to; their ideas merit consideration. Joan Beck, who writes a syndicated column read by millions, "You and Your Child," has now written a challenging book, How to Raise a Brighter Child: The Case for Early Learning. This is called a "blueprint" for increasing your child's brain power without "pushing." Pamela Dee Tedesco, an active member of the Arcadia Ward, Pasadena Stake, California, and an honor student majoring in sociology at Pasadena City College, was chosen from among 474 contestants for the enviable role of Queen of the Tournament of Roses Parade on New Year's Day, 1970. Flower floats of magnificent, highly imaginative artistry were entered from countless sources and America watched the astonishing procession. Pamela does volunteer work at Maryvale Girls Home, works at a department store, teaches a junior Sunday School class, and particularly enjoys her college institute class. She feels that her Church activities were an important element in preparing her to win this high distinction. 1969 award winners Relief Society Short Story Contest The General Board of Relief Society is pleased to announce the winners in the 1969 Relief Society Short Story Contest. The first prize of seventy-five dollars is awarded to Sylvia Probst Young, Midvale, Utah, for her story "Come Back Mis' Mackenzie." Sixty dollars goes to second prize winner Sara Brown Neilson, Pasadena, California, for her story "A Place in the Picture." Third prize of fifty dollars is awarded to Joan B. Kearl, Provo, Utah, for her story "A New Season for Christy." The Relief Society Short Story Contest was first conducted in 1942 as a feature of the Relief Society Centennial observance, and was made an annual contest in 1943. The contest is open to all Latter-day Saint women who have had at least one literary composition published or accepted for publication in a periodical of recognized merit. The contest was initiated to encourage the sisterhood of the Church to express themselves in the field of fiction. They are encouraged to read and study short stories and fiction techniques in order to improve their writing skills and appreciation for short stories. The General Board feels that the contest has helped to improve the quality of writing among the sisters of the Church, and is an aid to improving the literary quality of the Magazine. Prize-winning stories are the property of the General Board of Relief Society and may not be used for publication except by written permission from the General Board. The Board reserves the right to publish any of the stories submitted to the contest, paying for them at regular Magazine rates upon publication. A winner who has received first prize two consecutive years must wait two years before she is again eligible to enter the contest. There were seventy-seven stories submitted to the 1969 contest, including one each from England, Israel, and Scotland. Utah and California topped eighteen States of the United States in number of entrants. Mrs. Young has appeared many times in the Magazine, and has been a Story contest winner two other times, and a poem contest winner four times. Mrs. Neilson has also had stories published in the Magazine, and has been a winner once before. Mrs. Kearl will be new to readers. Gratitude is extended to the judges and to the members of the General Board who served on the contest committee. The winners are to be congratulated for the quality of writing, and the development of their stories. The prize-winning stories are presented in this issue along with brief biographical sketches of the authors. 267 Sylvia Probst Young = When I came to school that morning Mis' Mackenzie was standing at the south window watching the clouds, high and wispy, moving rapidly across the morning sky. It was a kind of ritual with her, standing at the window for a few moments of quiet contemplation before the day's work started. "It helps me to get things in focus, so that everything can start right," she once explained to me. "Good morning, Joe. You're an early bird." She turned from the window as I came in, and the brightness of her smile made me feel good all over. Mis' Mackenzie (she was really Mrs. Mackenzie, but children usually call a married lady Mis') had been my teacher ever since I 268 First Prize Story come back to school that morning. Mis' Mackenzie had started school, and I was in the sixth grade. In fact she was the only teacher Indian Bend had ever had. Ours was one of those few one-room schools, remaining because of necessity, too far away from any other school in the district to be consolidated. Indian Bend had grown up around the dam, and the Mackenzies had been some of the first people there because Mr. Mackenzie was one of the chief engineers. Mis' Mackenzie, who had been a schoolteacher, consented to teach the school. A few months before the dam was completed, Mr. Mackenzie died quite suddenly of a heart attack. Everyone thought then that Mis' Mackenzie would move away; she had a son living in California, and we all expected her to go there to live, but she didn't. She stayed right on and kept teaching our school. Once I asked her why she didn't go to California to teach, there wouldn't be all the winter snow to buck, and her son and his family wanted her to come. "Why, Joe, how would you all get along without me?" she laughed. Then she looked solemn. "I guess it's because I love you all, and I'm something like a plant, I have deep roots here. Then, too, it might be quite hard to get a teacher to come, you know."

Teachers can just about choose where they want to go these days." That was Miss Mackenzie all right; she was always thinking of others. Although she went to California every year when school was out, she always came back in the fall. And, to tell the truth, I don't know what would have happened to our school if she had decided not to return. Miss Mackenzie was our ideal, and we all loved her; everyone in Indian Bend felt that way about her. She was small and plumpish (Miss Mackenzie was always on a diet). Her hair was soft brown, and when you stood close to her it made you remember the smell of apple blossoms. I thought the most beautiful thing about her were her eyes, dark and so very expressive, set beneath the little smile wrinkles that framed them. She was fired with enthusiasm, and although she must have been all of sixty, she looked easily ten years younger. She could jog a mile and bat a ball as far as any of the boys. Equally enthusiastic for work, she spent long hours of extra time helping those who needed additional help, and she expected each of her students to do his very best in everything. "Need me to help you with anything?" I asked, as I crossed the room to my desk. She shook her head. "I was just standing here thinking what a beautiful day it is. The ground on the south side of the schoolhouse has finally dried up; we can jump rope and play marbles at recess." "Yah," I drawled, "but this kind of weather always gives me the spring fever." "Well, you're not so different, Joe," she confided. "I feel the same way. It always hits me about the middle of March, and I get real anxious to see my grandchildren again, even though it hasn't been so long since I was with them at Christmas." "We miss you in the summer, Miss Mackenzie, but you'll be coming back again?" It was the same old question that we always asked. Her smile was a little indecisive. "Sometimes I wonder just what I should do, Joe. My family are after me all the time to come down there and stay, and somehow I don't like the snowdrifts like I used to. Do you suppose I'm getting old?" she laughed. The other children started coming in then. There were seventeen of us altogether, two or three in every grade. I looked over the group as we took our seats; there was such a wide range of ability and personality that I wondered again how Miss Mackenzie was able to keep such perfect order and still keep everyone happy and studious. Her greatest challenge, I felt sure, was in the sixth grade with Deloris and Marybeth. Deloris, two heads taller than Miss Mackenzie and mature for her age, looked more like sixteen than twelve. Her eyes were dark and sultry, and it seemed that she always had a chip on her shoulder—a kind of defensive thing, perhaps because she was the only one of her nationality in our school. Marybeth, by contrast, was fair-haired, small, and frail. From infancy she had suffered with a crippling bone disease in her right leg. Now, after five operations, she was able to walk fairly well with the aid of a crutch. But in spite of her affliction, she radiated sunshine wherever she went. The children at school all had a kind of protective feeling for Marybeth, and it was easily understood why she was a favorite of everyone.

The day started as most of our school days did, with a warm greeting from Miss Mackenzie, the Pledge of Allegiance, and a few minutes for sharing interests. Nancy Hopkins had brought a rock collection to show the class, and Tom Peters was proudly wearing a brand new wrist watch that his grandma in Illinois had sent him for his birthday. The sun was still warm and bright at recess, and we all went out eagerly to play. Mark Clayson and I were playing marbles on the south side of the schoolhouse. Most of the girls were jumping rope close by, but we hadn't paid any particular attention to them until there was a sudden, loud commotion, and a chorus of voices, high and angry. Looking up, I saw Deloris standing apart from the others. "I hate you," she hissed out the words. "I hate you, Marybeth Frazer, and I'm glad you're a cripple!" She turned then and ran swiftly into the schoolhouse. Miss Mackenzie came around the schoolhouse just in time to hear the dramatic outburst; her face paled, and she bit her lower lip. "What was the problem?" she asked gently. All of the girls tried to talk at once, and it was quite evident that they were all in sympathy with Marybeth. Then, without saying anything more, Miss Mackenzie went back into the schoolhouse, and when we came in from recess she was writing arithmetic problems on the blackboard. Deloris sat with her head buried on her desk. What had taken place between the two of them we could only wonder. Nobody said a word, but there was a kind of heavy feeling all over the room. Miss Mackenzie went right on with the arithmetic as if nothing had happened, but Deloris never once looked up, and when we were dismissed for lunch she bolted out of the room, ran all the way home, and didn't return for the rest of the day.

After that nothing seemed quite the same. Deloris returned to school, but she was sullen and withdrawn, staying by herself and answering as briefly as possible when spoken to. It seemed to me that Miss Mackenzie looked suddenly tired and old, and very sad, like a person who had lost something dear. I wanted to talk to her, but I didn't know just what to say. Then one night an opportunity came.

I had stayed to help hang some pictures we had drawn, and Miss Mackenzie started to talk about the things that were troubling her. "Joe," she said, "I've about decided to stay in California when I go." I was standing on a chair, reaching up to the top of the chalkboard, and I almost lost my balance. When I regained my footing, I looked down at her. "Miss Mackenzie, please don't do that," I begged. "We have to have you." "Nobody's indispensable, Joe. There is always someone who can do the job as well or better than the person before him. Besides, I'm getting older, and I'm really tired." I became brave then, ventured the question. "It's because of Deloris, isn't it?" I asked. And she shook her head quickly. "Not Deloris, but my inability to reach her, to help her, to make her grow in understanding. Her antagonism is like a cloud of gloom over everyone in our class."

I should be able to help her find herself and help her to realize that we all want to be her friend as well as Marybeth's. I have tried in every way I know, but I have failed. It's in myself that I am disappointed." I tried to tell her that no other teacher could do more than she had done, but a sixth grade boy isn't so good at saying things in just the right kind of way. There was nothing left to do but hope that something might happen to make everything right again. The time passed quickly, and April 1970 almost before we realized it the time for school to close had come. Miss Mackenzie had promised us a picnic day during the last week, and we decided to have it on the day before school let out, with the hopes that there would be no rain. Lucky enough the day dawned clear and bright, and promised to be just right for outdoor activities. There was a small baseball park about four blocks from the schoolhouse where everyone had picnics, and that is where we were going for relays, a baseball game, and to eat our lunch. Miss Mackenzie promised to take along the book she had been reading to us and finish the story of Toronado Jones. I half expected not to see Deloris at all that day, but just before the bell rang she came. Most of the girls had worn slacks, but Deloris was wearing a blue checked gingham dress that seemed to give a special glow to her dark eyes. Or, maybe, it was the shoes that made her eyes glow; she was wearing a brand new pair of white shoes. They looked more like the kind to wear to a party, with shining silver buckles and narrow little straps that fit across the instep. They weren't the kind of shoes to wear for an outdoor picnic and game day. But in all her life Deloris hadn't had many new things, and I had heard some of the older folks say that her stepfather was real mean to her. She had worn old shoes all year, so to have a new pair at last must have really lifted her spirits way up, and I guess she wanted us all to see. Miss Mackenzie and some of the girls told her how pretty her shoes were, and she smiled for the first time in weeks. When we were ready to go, Lucy Reynolds came in with a note from her mother, asking if she could go to the little grocery store to get some twinkies for her lunch. The little store was about a block in the opposite direction, but Lucy promised that she would go as quickly as she could. "May Marybeth please go with me?" she asked. Miss Mackenzie seemed to be a little uncertain, but she knew that Marybeth would not like it if anyone had the idea that it would be too far for her to walk, so she consented, telling the class that we would walk slowly, and if Lucy and Marybeth hurried they could probably catch up with us. As we walked along everyone was trying to talk at once, and asking Miss Mackenzie a hundred questions. When we came down the road to the ball park, old man Brady, who was irrigating his garden, called a greeting to Miss Mackenzie. He was about the only person in Indian Bend who raised a vegetable garden, but he surely knew how to raise good vegetables. My dad said he learned that in the Old Country. Every summer he passed out his beets and chard and corn and tomatoes to the neighbors. "Looks like you're getting an early start in the garden," Miss Mackenzie called back to him. "Yah, water is what they need to grow." He leaned on his hoe and looked at us. "School picnic, huh?" "School picnic," Miss Mackenzie replied. Mac- "School's about out, huh? Well, when you come back from California these little plants will have the best tomatoes you ever tasted, Miss Mackenzie." "You always do raise the best," Miss Mackenzie told him. He beamed and nodded, and we walked on to the park. Miss Mackenzie looked back anxiously for Lucy and Marybeth. "I wonder what's keeping them?" she said. "We'll go in and get started on some relays, maybe they'll be here by then." The grass in the little park was green and fresh looking, and we all sat down to rest for a few minutes. Miss Mackenzie kept looking back, but still the girls didn't come. "I shouldn't have let them stay behind," she worried. "We all tried to assure her that nothing had happened. They're probably picking out penny candy, and it takes a long time to do that," one of the boys concluded. "Or maybe the store was full of people and they had to wait their turn," someone else said. Come Back, Miss Mackenzie Finally we started a stick relay, and the seconds were running, when we heard a call. Marybeth and Lucy were standing on the other side of the road. We saw immediately what had happened; old man Brady's irrigation water was flooding the road. Swift rivulets were cutting through the dirt, leaving deposits of mud and gravel. "We can't get across!" Lucy cried. "Marybeth can't cross the road!" We all knew that, of course. Marybeth, with her crutch, was not too sure-footed at anytime, so she couldn't possibly attempt a rutted, wet road. Lucy, who was smaller than Marybeth, would do well to get across herself. "We'll have to help them," Miss Mackenzie said. "Wait right there girls," she called back, "wait right there, and I'll come." But just as she started, Deloris darted out. Across the mud and water she ran—Deloris with the new white shoes. We watched as she picked Marybeth up in her arms, crutch and all, and carried her across, with Lucy stepping carefully beside her. The beautiful white shoes, that had been so proudly displayed a short while before, now oozed with mud and water. They could never look as nice again. But Deloris didn't seem to mind, for suddenly Marybeth and she were friends again, and all of the April 1970 unhappiness of the previous weeks had vanished. Marybeth's eyes glowed with admiration and gratitude as Deloris put her down beside Miss Mackenzie. "I'm sorry we were so long," she apologized. "Lucy lost her quarter, and we searched until we found it." Then she put her arm around Deloris. "You're one of the very nicest girls in school, and I love you, but I feel so bad about your shoes. They're ruined now." Deloris merely shrugged. "I can dry them, and polish them, and they'll be good as new." She was smiling, and it was so good to see her that way. We had the nicest kind of day. We played games and sang, and Miss Mackenzie read to us. She seemed more happy and carefree than she had been for a long time. It was almost as if a great load had been lifted from her shoulders.

Had been lifted from her shoulders. The next morning we all went to school to get our promotion cards, and to say goodbye. I noticed that Deloris was wearing her white shoes, but they didn't look quite new anymore, even with polish on them. Miss Mackenzie talked to us for a few minutes, and wished us all a very happy vacation. Then she stood in the doorway to pass out the cards. When it was Deloris's turn to go by, she reached out her hand and shyly touched Miss Mackenzie. "Come back, Miss Mackenzie," she said softly, "come back." Miss Mackenzie's eyes glistened suddenly, and her smile was as bright as the morning sunshine. "I will, Deloris," she answered emphatically, "I certainly will."

Writing, along with working in a flower garden, and companioning with books are my great loves. I have written poetry, stories, and articles for all the Church magazines. My poetry has been published in Utah Sings, The Deseret News, The Salt Lake Tribune, and a national anthology. In 1966 | won The Deseret News Christmas Story Contest. This is the third time a story of mine has been selected as a winner in the Relief Society Short Story Contest. In the Relief Society Poem Contest I have been among the winners four times.

Usually in a story some of the characters are prototypes of people we know. Miss Mackenzie was patterned from the life of a dear sister whose selfless dedication as a teacher of children in the Church, as well as in the public schools, will be long remembered.

Reid W. Young, a former bishop of the Midvale Fourth Ward, and now a member of the Midvale Stake High Council, is my husband, and we are the parents of four wonderful sons.

Second Prize Story
A Place In The Picture

Are mothers really afraid of their teenagers? I asked my inner-self as I listened to the exposed motor in Dave's stripped-down car-version roar his exit to school. That was what a psychologist had said at the PTA lecture last night. It was true I had stood silently by as Dave skipped breakfast again and brushed past me in ragged jeans, over-run desert boots, and a clean, but grease-stained T-shirt; knowing full well he had a math test and that an empty stomach produced low blood sugar detrimental to clear thinking. If he had to dress that way, I thought with indignation, it might make some sense.

I sighed and started clearing the breakfast dishes. Scraping out good food had always been against my conservative nature and I Sara Brown Neilson automatically picked up a fork to salvage some of the highly nutritious, almost cold food that I had hopefully prepared for Dave. I wasn't fond of scrambled eggs, but choked it down, thinking of the garbage-disposal alternative. Why hadn't I made him get up earlier so he could eat? Why hadn't I insisted he wear some of the respectable clothes that bulged his closet, and done something about the straggling hair, sloppy posture, and weird new philosophies he was analyzing?

Could that psychologist possibly be right? Maybe, with all the talk of generation-gap and youth-rebellion, I was afraid to take a stand. 275

April 1970

Thinking through problems had always been part of washing the breakfast dishes, while my mind was still rested and fresh, but this morning even motion seemed distracting. I sank onto a kitchen chair, cupped my chin in the palm of my hand, and stared unseeing out the window. Painfully and with care I began a review of my relationship with Dave to see just what my place was in his picture.

Scrutinizing his activities, attitudes, and reactions, left me with the shocking realization that I really didn't have a place—I just didn't count! Sure, I washed clothes, prepared meals, took telephone messages, and cleaned his room, but any stranger could do that. And my concerned love in doing it didn't count for much, since he wasn't even aware it existed.

A hollow wave of longing left me reminiscing the place of honor I used to hold in his life—the main reason for most of the things he did—telling the truth, eating his carrots, swallowing his medicine—all to please Mom. Now he went into a detailed analysis of the scientific, psychological value of truth-telling when I mentioned it, refused to consume even one carrot, and decided for himself if the medicine I prescribed was necessary.

Desperately I groped for the memories of a long-ago picnic, when we had strolled leisurely through the woods discovering gold-flecked stones, shed snakeskins, or an injured bird to fix; and for the precious hours spent together on rainy days when we had molded clay into funny animals or built houses from diced potatoes and toothpicks. I ached for the satisfaction I had felt in teaching him patriotism and honor while we made soldier hats and three-dimensional stars for the neighborhood parade.

Of course, my place of importance had started shrinking to make room for sports with Dad, outings with the scoutmaster, practicing with his guitar teacher and goofing around with his friends. And I had been willing, even anxious, for each new experience in his growth. But, did I have to become a nonentity? Couldn't I fit in some place? Where had I lost out?

A glance at the clock spurred me to action and I continued analyzing to the accompaniment of running water and clinking dishes. Stabs of self-pity needled me as I reviewed Dave's present efforts to please everyone else—fix the tape recorder for a friend, sell tickets for a counselor, wash cars for the club. No longer did it matter what Mom thought, or felt, or needed. My influence was gone.

"No, Mr. Psychologist," I said aloud to the draining dish water, "this mother isn't afraid of her teenager; she just doesn't exist in his life—except for maid service, that is!"

My day went with the usual housewife routines, and I was just finishing a batch of cookies when a roar sounded in the driveway. Dave shuffled in depositing a few mud clods along the way and sprinkling fresh sawdust from the cuffs of his pants. It was obvious he had stayed after school for a track work-out to please the coach. Dropping his books on the table, he slouched down on a chair and started munching one of the still warm cookies that were spread out in front of him to cool.

How many times had I asked him to clean his feet and shake his cuffs after a work-out?

He knew the table wasn't for books—after all I had provided him with a nice desk. He could see it was nearly dinnertime and knew late nibbling irritated me. Then, there were the two freshly ironed shirts I had found in a heap on his bed, apparently discarded in favor of the grease-stained 'T-shirt. I bore my resentments in silence. "Hey, Mom, did you ever return that stuff I borrowed from Craig?" he muttered between chews. "No, kinda thought you would take care of it," I said, knowing full well it would be left for me. There just hadn't been time from my maid service to do it, I thought bitterly, but I had certainly stumbled over it enough times! Still heaped in his room was the unpacked gear he had used on a week's fishing trip down the Snake River before school started. That had been a full two weeks ago and I was still trying to outwait him. I hated being reminded of the trip because it had terrified me. Knowing the dangers of Snake River, with its swift currents, unannounced falls, and sharp rocks, gave me sleep-shattering nightmares of black, rushing waters swallowing him up, canoe and all. "Boys have to live with some danger," his father had gently reminded me, "that's part of growing up. He's a good swimmer and will wear a life-jacket for extra protection." My fears were smothered back in muteness, knowing it didn't matter what I thought, anyway. The sleepless nights persisted, however, and I had even considered resorting to tranquilizers. Instead I took up night nibbling to ease the sickening fear-waves in my stomach, and gained back the five pounds I had struggled to lose. My face showed signs of wear and strain, in spite of the additional weight, and the week he was gone seemed endless. When we unexpectedly heard his familiar voice in the driveway a night earlier than scheduled, the blessed relief left me with a mad urge to rush outside and smother him with kisses. Knowing his distaste for emotional demonstration, I forced myself to follow nonchalantly behind his father and greet him with a casual peck on the cheek. "Hi, we've missed you; how was the trip?" "Groovy, Mom. That river is something else! Can't say as how I wish we were just leaving, though, it wasn't exactly easy don't think [ll get up for a month... Good 'ole shower here I come!" He had disappeared around the corner and I knew I'd had it. That was all—the only report I would get of a whole trip. He looked thin and parched and I longed to comfort him. He must have lost pounds! I followed him into the house and automatically turned to the refrigerator.

Looking at him now, the picture of health munching on a cookie, I decided he had recuperated completely. A brief knock turned our attention to the back door. Craig had already stuck his head inside. "Anybody home?" "Come on in," Dave invited, "Tl bet you're after a fishing reel, hunting knife, and mess kit! Just thought maybe I could stall around until you came." "That's what I figured, and I hated letting you get the best of me, but my uncle is in town and wants the stuff to go fishing." | | Dave wiped his mouth on his sleeve and pushed back the chair. "Have some cookies while I go unload my pack and find it. They're great while they're still warm." I smiled my approval and indicated a chair at the table. "How about some milk with them?" "Don't mind if I do thanks, they smell great!" I poured the milk and then picked up a potato to peel.

"Hey, that was really a close one Dave had, wasn't it?" Craig said, taking a big swallow. "Guess you feel pretty lucky he's even here." I looked at him curiously. "Close one?" "You mean he didn't even tell you about that hairy ordeal on the river? What a jerk! Just like me, though, hate to make a big deal out of anything."

A chill gripped me! So, the nightmares hadn't been unfounded. "What happened?" I asked struggling for composure.

"Well, it was sure sweaty! I still get shook up when I think about it! We were going down the river in a swift current—you know—really swift—when we hit some rapids. It was pretty rough and a kid's canoe turned over in the banging around. He tried to grab onto a rock, but the rushing water took him on over the falls. When we could see he was having a struggle, Dave worked his way down and went in after him. [ll tell you, that took guts the rest of us were afraid! Well, anyway, pretty soon the kid made it to the bank with the help of his lifejacket, but, golly, Dave was no place to be seen. His life-jacket had been ripped off by the sharp rocks and the falling water kept forcing him under!"

I dug deep into the potato and gripped it tighter. "How long was he down there?" "Seemed forever to us, I'll tell you! We started going in to look for him, but the water was so swift it smashed us on the rocks and we had to pull out in a few seconds."

He took another swallow of milk and I could feel the thump of my pounding heart. "Well, anyway, as you've probably guessed, he didn't drown. One of us finally spotted him going downstream and rushed out to get him. We could hardly believe our eyes! And you know what? I guess you're the one that really saved his life."

By this time I had forgotten my reserve and was hovering over him eagerly searching his face. "What do you mean?" He shifted his weight uneasily, conscious of my nearness.

"Well... A when the falling water kept pushing him back under he was getting desperate and almost out of air. He made another try and still another, until his breath was all gone and things started going black. He was scared, really scared, you know, thinking it was the end and all, but right then—it was funny, he said he heard your voice from when he was just a little kid, telling him never to give up—that the time to fight hardest is when you think you're licked. So he made one more desperate lunge and came up just clear of the falls!"

My hands were damp and I could feel perspiration dotting my forehead as Dave appeared in the doorway with the borrowed things. Seeming to sense the impact of the moment, he hesitated, appraising the situation. Then he looked deep into my misty eyes and gradually I felt a bond of understanding warmth flow between us—the stirring of a realization that our lives were deeply entwined with the years of learning and sharing.

The petty slights, my desires for attention, and the daily irritations had dulled my sensitivity to his true worth and goodness.

I was housing a precious soul under this roof—a boy who, in the midst of conflict, frustration, and varied forces, was emerging in his own way with courage, solid values, and a strong regard for my teachings—a boy whose very life I had played a part in saving! Craig gave Dave a punch in the ribs and opened the door to leave. "Next time I'll outwait you!" "Don't count on it," Dave called after him and then slouched back down on the chair to reach for another cookie. I handed him the warmest one I could find and picked up his books to carry to the desk. On the way, I patted the top of his head. So there were a few mud clods on the floor, and a couple of shirts to be pressed... What were mothers for, anyway?

SUMSION NEW SEASON FOR CHRISTY @ It was Sunday afternoon and Susan Barnes was walking to church. The day had been perfect, Susan reflected. Everything had gone smoothly and the old house had rung with laughter and happiness. It wasn't often that everyone could be home at the same time, but they had each made a special effort in order to welcome Christy home from Europe where she had been studying art. Susan enjoyed having her family home and seeing the change in them. Maturity sat well on those who were now parents, and the grandchildren changed with the rapidity that is peculiar to the very young. And yet the biggest change was in Christy! Feeling the need for some quiet time, Susan had left her family preparing for church. JOAN B. KEARL Soon they would join her to partake of the sacrament together and listen to Christy who was the speaker this evening. She admired the brilliant splashes of color on the mountains that made such a magnificent backdrop for the old chapel. Lawns, too, were washed with color where leaves had started to feather down into bright heaps. She felt a sense of sadness. This was the end of autumn; the earth was turning toward winter. Slipping quietly into the center of the third row where she would be able to look into Christy's face later, she looked around the empty chapel. Here, too, was evidence of change. Soon they would meet in the new building and some of the familiar things had already been moved. The feeling of sadness persisted. Why did things have to end? She wondered. The five days since Christy's return had been hectic. The phone rang constantly, friends dropped in, Christy went out. Never time for mother and daughter to have a serious talk in all the hubbub. Susan needed the peace she always felt in the chapel. She needed time to meditate. Now she closed her eyes and let her mind drift back over the twenty years since Christy had arrived at the Barnes home. From the start, she had been different from the other six children. Refusing to wait until Susan could get to the hospital, Christy had been born in the big bed at home. And this had seemed to set the pattern for her life—impatient, impulsive, independent. Susan remembered vividly the little girl who insisted, "Mama, Christy do. Me dress me." And it hadn't taken long before she had mastered the art. She loved nursery school and kindergarten, her quicksilver mind absorbing everything. The years from diapers to high school had flown by in a mixture of short and long, long and short, that included everything from limbs to hair, dresses to telephone calls. Name the skill or talent and Christy had it. She had been loved, trained, and exhibited by her family since she first rolled over from her round little tummy onto her back. Susan remembered the first time she had been afraid. Christy made the honor roll in high school without even trying, and then Susan realized that things came too easily for her daughter. Whatever it was Christy wanted, Christy got. There had never been a time when she'd had to sacrifice or do without in her whole life. How could she learn to give of herself or really care about others this way? Bob's death had been a test. He and Christy had always delighted in each other. At the hospital, he had explained, as only he could, all of Christy's heartrending "why's." Now Susan felt her throat tighten as she remembered Christy's bright head on the pillow beside her father's bandage-swathed one. She had gone to the window and turned her back because it was nearly more than she could bear to watch them. "Kitten," Bob's voice was soft but Susan could still hear the words. "Kitten, your mother made a heaven on earth for me. Choose your partner wisely when your time comes." His voice grew weaker. "Remember, this life isn't the end for us." Christy was grief-stricken after the funeral. For days she refused to see her friends, answering the phone. She grew peaked and pale. Susan was grateful when Christy made a great effort and slowly pulled herself together, but it was a long time before things were back to normal. And then one day Christy brought Don Taylor home to meet her mother. Susan had known, just from the way Christy looked, that Don was special. He not even came from a wealthy Philadelphia family, his manners were charming, and he was devoted to Christy. The two young people spent all their spare time together and Susan was happy with the way things were going.

That is, until she found out that Don wasn't a member of the Church. She cautioned Christy to go slowly, emphasizing the importance of temple marriage. "Don't worry, Mom," Christy said, putting her arm around Susan's shoulders. "Don loves me and I know he'll join the Church for me." Susan was shocked. "Darling," she said, "when he joins the Church it must be because he knows it is true, and for that reason only."

A New Season for Christy

But Christy had already made her plans. A few nights later, when she went to say goodnight after a date, she held out her left hand to show the beautiful diamond that sparkled on her third finger. "We're going to be married in six weeks, Mom. Not a very big wedding. Mostly family and close friends. We're going to phone the Taylors in the morning." Susan felt the bitter taste of panic rising in her throat. Impulsive, independent, impatient Christy. So young, so sure of herself. "Yes, your ring is lovely, dear," she said, trying to keep her voice steady. "I know you're excited, but you have got to get some sleep now." Reaching for her robe and slippers, Susan couldn't remember when she had felt so cold. "I'll fix you a glass of warm milk to help you relax. You get ready for bed and I'll bring it in to you."

After she kissed Christy, Susan lay wide awake in the big bed. Never before had it seemed so empty. Never before had she needed Bob so much. Slipping to her knees, she poured out her doubts and fears to the Lord, praying long and earnestly for courage and wisdom.

Finally, exhausted and cold, but without the earlier feeling of panic, she returned to her bed. In the early hours of morning she drifted into sleep. The next few days she talked with Christy many times, but always the answer was the same: "We love each other and want to be married now." Once Christy even accused her of "wanting to hang on to me." Seeing the hurt look on Susan's face, she had apologized immediately. "I'm sorry, Mother. I didn't mean that."

"All I'm asking is that you wait a little while," Susan said. "Until you know each other better." "True love lasts," she added.

But Christy existed in a romantic haze all her own, impervious to the outside world. "I can convert Don after we're married and we can still go to the temple, Mom," she said. "Don't worry so much. Everything will work out just fine. It always does." But Susan couldn't share her daughter's optimism. "Christy," she said, "will you fast and pray with me tomorrow? Please, dear. Let us take this to the Lord."

And because Christy loved her mother and had never been willfully disobedient, she agreed.

The following morning Christy awakened from the first real sleep she'd had in several nights. Christy was standing by the bed. "What is it, dear?" Susan turned on the light. "Are you all right?"

"Something woke me up," Christy said. "And it wasn't a dream." Her face was pale in the soft lamplight. "Get under the covers with me for a minute." Susan saw that Christy was shivering. "There, that's better. Do you want to talk about it?" "Someone was calling me. It was a woman's voice and she spoke a foreign language, but I knew she was saying that she needed me. At first I thought it was a dream and tried to go back to sleep. But, Mother, the same thing happened again twice more. Just that voice calling to me for help."

"Were you afraid, Christy?" Susan asked.

"No, I wasn't," Christy said. "It didn't give me a bad feeling." Her voice was filled with awe. "What do you think it means?"

"I don't know, but we could ask the Lord," Susan said.

"That is what I wanted you to say, Mother. Will you ask him?" Christy asked.

"No, I don't think that would be right," Susan replied. "The voice called you, but we will kneel together."

The two heads were bowed for a long time, but when they finally got back into bed the only answer they received was a feeling of peace and calm. They slept within a few minutes.

Susan opened her eyes to find Christy, propped up on one arm, looking at her. "I love you, Mother," she said. Leaning forward, she kissed Susan's cheek. "I'm sure the Lord answered our prayers last night. Several days ago you said if I went to Europe for six months you would not oppose any plans I made on my return. Well, that is what I'm going to do."

She plumped the pillows behind her back. "It isn't what I want to do. I want to stay here and go through with the wedding plans, but I know you are worried about me. I've been lying here thinking it all through. I'll talk with Don first thing and then take the first plane I can get to Rome. The sooner I leave here, the sooner I'll be back."

She spoke quietly and matter-of-factly. "Any special reason for choosing Rome?" Susan asked.

"Well, I have a feeling the voice was calling me in Italian," Christy said, smiling self-consciously. "Maybe someone over there does need me. Anyway, I've decided to start there. Good thing my passport is in order."

Two days later she was in Rome. The first letters were filled with homesickness and Susan's heart ached for her daughter, but soon they changed as Christy became involved in her studies. Then they changed again as she became involved in people.

Susan remembered how proud she had been when the letters showed Christy unconsciously filling a mission. She was teaching the gospel to a young couple who became interested after Christy explained why she didn't have wine with her meals. One letter said, "I wanted the missionaries to teach the lessons, but Mario and Elaina wouldn't hear of it. They want me to teach them, Mother."

Another letter received a little later said, "Last night I taught them about eternal marriage. They both cried and said it was the most beautiful thing they had ever heard. This morning they came really early and asked me to make arrangements for their baptism. I called the branch president and he is coming over this evening to talk with them. Mother, Elaina has a terminal disease and they want to be together forever. Isn't that wonderful?"

There were big blotches on the paper and the ink had run in several places. Susan imagined Christy's tears staining the paper.

More letters followed. Mario and Elaina were baptized. They were saving to go to the temple in Switzerland. They were expecting a baby and Elaina's health was improving. Many months later a letter arrived from Switzerland saying, "They were married and sealed in the Swiss Temple today. I drove up with them but, of course, I didn't go into the temple. They are so happy."

A baby daughter was born whom they named Christina and called Christy.

Two months later Elaina died.: "Mario says they knew she didn't have much time, but this isn't the end, just a change for awhile. Mother, that is what Daddy said to me just before he died." A week later Susan received a cable. 'My work done. Elaina doesn't need me any longer. Please meet plane 1:55 P.M. Your time tomorrow. Love Christy.' The six months agreed upon had stretched into fifteen! Christy had seen Don every night but no plans were mentioned. Last night when Christy came in to say goodnight she held out a bare left hand. "I gave the ring back to Don," she said. "But do you mind if we don't talk about it right now?" Susan blinked back tears as she kissed her daughter. She knew Christy would talk about it when she was ready. * * * *

"Grandma, are you sleeping?" Susan opened her eyes to see her little granddaughter looking up into her face. She was surprised to see that the chapel was nearly filled. "No, dear. I'm not sleeping." "Then why were your eyes shut?" "I was thinking, Julie," she answered softly. With an effort she brought her thoughts back to the present and soon Christy stood before them all. 

"I want to tell you a story," she said. "One day, soon after I arrived in Rome, I went sightseeing. I rented a little car and managed to get myself hopelessly lost in— all the twists and turns in that great city. When I finally did get back, I found I had locked the key inside the apartment when I left that morning. It was dark and I was tired and discouraged. As I stood there on the doorstep, a young woman asked if I was in trouble and if she could help me. Her English was broken, but we could understand each other. I explained my predicament and she said, 'You wait. I come soon.' In a few minutes she was back with a key and opened the door for me."

So that is how she met Elaina, Susan mused. "I thanked her, grateful to go inside and rest," Christy continued. "I was lucky that someone else had a key." 

"Latter-day Saints are seeking admission into the home of Heavenly Father. Keys are made available to each of us, but sometimes we get lost along the road leading to exaltation. In Rome I had to fight a strange city that seemed to have no traffic laws, an unfamiliar language, and twists and turns that seemed to take me nowhere. As Latter-day Saints we fight temptation, sin, and weakness all our lives. If we do get off the straight and narrow road it is possible to get back onto it. But what happens if, when we finally stand on the doorstep of our Heavenly Father's house, we find we have no key? No one else can open that door for us. We must have our own key."

Christy's voice quivered in earnestness. She leaned on the podium in an effort to get as close as possible to the congregation. "The first principles of the gospel, faith, repentance, baptism, and the laying on of hands by those in authority," she continued, "is the key that will gain us admission into the celestial kingdom." 

"But is that enough for us? No. It certainly is not." The clear voice rose in volume until it filled every part of the silent chapel. "We want to go into the highest degree of that kingdom and become sons and daughters of God, heirs of his kingdom."

The congregation felt the spirit which flowed from Christy and leaned toward her straining to take the spirit into themselves. Now the words came softly. "For that key we must go to the temple and be married and sealed for time and all eternity." Christy looked into her mother's eyes as she spoke and Susan knew the reason for the broken engagement and silently gave thanks.

"The ordinances of the temple," Christy said, "pertain to the celestial kingdom where our Heavenly Father is. Nevertheless, it is given to us to choose and our final destination is our own fault or blessing." With tears streaming down her cheeks, Christy bore her testimony and the meeting was quickly brought to a close.

For several minutes people remained in their seats, as if reluctant to leave the building where they had received a spiritual feast. Susan, too, sat quietly enjoying the great peace that permeated her body. Things had to change if there was to be progress, she reflected. This chapel had served the ward well many years but it could be used for a new purpose in the future.

The change from autumn to winter is not sudden. The signs are there if we look. The days grow shorter, nights have a touch of frost, the air becomes crisp and the leaves change color and fall. Outside, the trees with their branches stark and barren stretched skyward, awaiting a new season. And this was a new and radiant Christy. A Christy who had finally found her place in life. She, too, had passed into a new season.

All this, Susan thought, is a part of living. Nothing really ends; it just grows into something new.

I feel deeply honored and absolutely delighted to be a winner in the Relief Society Short Story Contest. I had let myself become intimidated by the fact that I had not had a university education. Then I submitted an article to The Improvement Era which was published in June 1969. After the many compliments received on that article, I decided to enter the Relief Society Short Story Contest. I am so happy that I did!

I was born in Cape Town, South Africa, the only member of my family to join the Church. My husband, Ted, is a Canadian and served a mission in New Zealand. Two of our children, Jeri and Gary, were born in Canada, while Keith, our youngest, was born in Provo. We are all active in the Pleasant View Third Ward, East Sharon Stake, Utah.

FIGHT CANCER WITH A CHECK-UP AND A CHECK FEE

Parker, 1970 Crusade Chairman

It takes you to fight cancer says the American Cancer Society. 'Fight cancer with a check-up and a check' is this year's slogan. An end to cancer is everyone's dream. Make it come true.

The dollars you give to the American Cancer Society during the 1970 Crusade work three ways—supporting research, education, and service to the cancer patient. There are 1.5-million Americans alive today, cured of cancer. To help save more, give more.

April is Cancer Control Month. One out of four Americans will eventually develop cancer. Thirty years ago, fewer than one in five was being saved from cancer; today the American Cancer Society reports, it is one in three.

It could be one in two with early detection and prompt treatment. Help protect yourself against cancer: have an annual health checkup including cancer tests. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among American men. "Best tip yet," says the American Cancer Society, "Don't Smoke Cigarettes." Women began smoking cigarettes after the First World War. Today we are seeing the results—the lung cancer death rate for women has jumped 400 percent! Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among American women. In the last thirty years, the uterine cancer death rate has been cut by sixty percent, thanks mainly to the Pap test for early detection and to improved treatment. Similar results can be achieved for other forms of cancer. Remember to ask your doctor about a procto as part of a regular health checkup. It is your smartest move against a form of cancer that is most common among both men and women.

@ SPRING BOUQUET
I received a lovely bouquet;
It was delivered early today.
And, oh, how it filled my heart with joy.
It was only a handful of posies,
But more precious than a dozen red roses.
Given to me by my little boy.

TOWEL ROBE

The colorful towel robe is made from just one towel. It is a simple "butterfly" pattern with few seams and requiring little sewing. A child would especially enjoy it for after bath drying or as an after-swim robe. The one in the picture was made for a little girl, but with a few minor changes, it could be used for small boys as well.

Choose a fringe-edged towel of medium weight, 21 by 45 inches in size. Fold the towel in half, right side out, and mark the center with a pin or tailor tack (221/2 inches on either side of mark). Bring the two fringed ends together at the center. Fold each end back to a width of 2 inches, including fringe. Place the right side on top of left side to form the front opening. Pin together until the cutting process is completed.

Measure 6 inches from the top on both sides and cut down to make ends of sleeves. At the bottom of the 6-inch cut, measure 31/4 inches toward center front and cut each side carefully. This completes the front part of the sleeve.

Roll Recipe
1 yeast cake
Yc. melted butter
1 tbsp. sugar
1/4 tsp. salt
1 c. scalded milk
3 well-beaten eggs
1/2 c. sugar
3-1/2 to 4 c. sifted flour

Crumble yeast cake, add 1 tbsp. sugar and stir until liquid.
(I use dry yeast and put it and the sugar in about 1/2 c. water.)
Add milk which has been cooled to lukewarm.
Add sugar, butter, salt, and eggs to yeast mixture and mix thoroughly.
Add flour enough to make a soft dough, but a dough stiff enough to knead. Beware of getting the dough too stiff, however.

(Cover and allow to rise 5 to 6 hours. Can be made the night before and left in the refrigerator or other cool place overnight.)

In the morning, place on a bread board and knead a little.
To make butter-horn rolls, divide the dough in half and roll each half as nearly round as possible and about 1/4-inch thick. Cut as you would a pie into sixteen pieces. Beginning at broad end, roll each section very loosely to small end and pinch end down. Put in buttered tins.
Let rise until very light, 4 to 6 hours.
Bake in a moderate oven (375°) for about 20 minutes.

Yield—32 rolls.

Raisin Filling
4 c.

Sugar 1% to 2%. Chopped raisins, melted butter. Cut basic dough recipe into halves. Roll each half about 4 inches wide and 15 inches long. Spread with butter, then sprinkle raisins and sugar over the rectangle. Fold over once from each side. Be certain the fold is loose so the rolls can rise freely. Cut each half into 16 slices. Place cut side down in buttered muffin tins into which 1/2 teaspoon of butter has been added. Allow to rise 5 to 6 hours. Bake about 20 minutes at 375° F. While hot, spread with icing made by combining 1 c. Powdered sugar, 2 tsp. Boiling water, and 1 tsp. Almond extract.

WHICH IS WHICH?  
I made a special kind of quilt  
To use up scraps, and fill a need;  
They go together, hit or miss,  
And color schemes I do not heed.  

Some blocks are pretty, I am pleased,  
And some are madly wry,  
So shall I laugh, or throw them out,  
And who is crazy, the quilt or \?

For every person there is one moment of beauty that forever remains with him.  
Though years grow long, there is one moment that opens on the inward eye and sets the strings of the heart vibrating faster in remembrance. A moment that is half pleasure, half pain—  
that leaves one balanced on the brink of tears or laughter. It may have been a summer sunset, a moon-drenched night, a bit of mountain glen that looked as if fairies had just quitted it, leaving the lily bells and lady's-slippers still swaying from their recent frolicking.  
It may have been a moment of music of such sweetness and poignancy that one's heart wept a little even as it thrilled to its spell. For everyone there is that moment that neither time nor succeeding experiences can ever dim or erase.  
It may steal upon your consciousness in hours of quiet reflection; it may confront you at odd, unexpected places when you are in the midst of daily tasks; it may drift into your dreams in the still hours of the night. No matter the time or place, it sweeps you back to remembered happiness.

My memory beautiful is April violets in an old-fashioned garden.  
I was very young when time spun out my silver strand of memory.  
The spring sun had come out and dried the tears on the face of the April morning.  
The birds were singing as they resumed their spring housebuilding and cleaning.  
The bees were zooming off on aerial reconnaissance flights in search of new honey caches.  
Rain puddles shone like new copper pennies.  
Everywhere there was a brightness, a cleanness, a sweetness that had not been there before.

294 Never an April Comes

I was on my way to my grandmother's, and the day seemed to be made especially lovely just for me.  
I waded in the puddles.  
I gathered rain-washed dandelions.  
I marveled at the waxy, green spires of the poplar trees towering so far above me I had to throw my head back to see their tips.  
At last Grandmother's red-brick house came into view.  
A moment later, I carefully opened the gate by the white lilac tree, tiptoed apprehensively past the old abandoned well, then danced up the path into the arms of my grandmother.  

I remember she asked me about Mother and the little brothers, and if my walk was nice.  
I remember she gave me caraway cookies and milk.  
Then, instead of saying, "Now, run out and play," she looked at me thoughtfully and said, "How would you like to pick violets?"  

In happy surprise, and before I quite knew what was happening, I was in the garden.  
Carefully, I closed the gate behind me; carefully, I turned around.  
Here at my feet, the ribbon grass rustled its taffeta panels in the gentle breeze.  
Farther along the walk, peony plants held pink-lacquered fingers aloft in the sunlight to dry.  
To the left, the yellow rosebush draped graceful garlands of waxen buds.  
Nearby, the delicate narcissus that seldom blossomed was flaunting its butterfly blooms from fragile, green stems.  
At the bottom of the garden, white and virginal like a young girl dressed in her first formal, stood a pear tree.  
There, beneath its snowy skirts, lay the violet bed.  
An emerald carpet studded with amethysts and moonstones—purple and white violets in mingled design peeping from their bed of green leaves.  

I breathed deeply of their heady perfume, and my senses swam.  
Suddenly, I flung myself face downward in that fragrant bed.  
I wanted to cry, and yet I knew I was happier than I had ever been.  
How long I lay in that sweet-scented spot, I do not know.  
It seemed forever and it seemed only a moment.  

At last, I began to gather violets—white in one hand, purple in the other.  
Reluctantly, I left the garden with a last, lingering look at all that loveliness.  
I closed the garden gate and started home.  
But my heart and inward eye refused to leave the garden and violet bed there; they picked it up and locked it away in a secret vault of my memory.  

There it blooms forever—unaffected by frost or flood, sunshine or shadow.  
Never an April comes, but on some quiet, moon-washed night I find my eager feet—once more young—running down that garden path to the violet bed.  
I bend to gather clusters of its beauty and sweetness in my hands, and then—the door of memory softly swings shut.  
I awake with empty hands, a heart that aches a little, and find the ghostly fragrance of violets drifting through my room.

For every person, there is a moment of beauty, a fragment of memory that forever remains.

BARBARA'S MORNING
She leans to windows of a year-old world,
Tiptoe to reach the sill that she may see
Beyond where all the little roads are curled
Across the morning hills, a place that she Is learning, leaf by leaf and bird by bird,
Until the land shrinks small enough to hold.
The heavens sing one note that she has heard;
The sun becomes one drop of yellow gold.

Mine is a giant world, my clouds too high,
And when I call, the sparrows do not come.
She lifts her hands and cups the summer sky,
And finds that she can bounce it on a thumb.

Spring was coming, not too soon to be sure,
but the days were getting longer and we didn't have to go to school in the dark.
One Saturday afternoon Mama decided it was time to get out the seed catalogues and send for the seeds and plants for the garden.
These books had begun to arrive at our house soon after the Christmas mail. We often turned their pages and wished we had a garden of such beautiful flowers and weed-free vegetables.
Despite all of our efforts, our garden and flower beds did not turn out so well.
Papa and Mama were seated and we children stood behind and helped to choose and point as each page came into view.
How good the pictures of the red radishes, green peas, and huge heads of cabbages looked.
The irises and roses were something to behold, but did not hold our interest too long.
A garden came first because it provided food for the large family that was ours.
Papa suggested that along with seeds we should have red currants and gooseberry bushes. Then he turned the page and we saw the apples.
Baskets and boxes of red and golden apples, some pictured hanging from the trees in beautiful perfection.
It was just too much.
"Mama, do you think that we could try an apple tree or two?" he asked.
"Well," Mama was hesitant, "perhaps a Yellow Transparent or a Winesap would mature and not freeze in our short season," she answered.
She went on as if she, too, had been compelled by the display of apples in the seed books. "Let us send for six apple trees."
The decision seemed to be final as decisions Mama made generally were.
The order blank was filled in carefully and completely, the check made out and enclosed.
Tom and I carried the letter to the mailbox to be picked up by the mail carrier the next day.
The instructions had stated that the trees would arrive at the proper planting time. I really didn't know just what planting time they had reference to.
I guess it meant Salt Lake Valley or Utah County, not up north where we lived.
When the apple trees arrived by parcel post there was an inch or two of snow on the ground.
A bitter cold wind was blowing from the very tops of the snowcapped mountains.
Plant trees in this weather? The package was carried into the house and opened by the warmth of the kitchen.
Brown limbs with a few scrawny roots at the bottom were a far cry from the pictures in the nursery books. Mama looked a little dejected.
She read the paper enclosed in the package. If ground and weather conditions were not suitable for planting, the plants were to be put in a cool place in water until weather permitted planting.
They stayed in our basement in a tub of water for three weeks. Then Mama decided, hot or cold, the trees must be put in the earth.
Planting the trees was a ceremony in itself. All members of the family old enough to be outside took part.
Papa went first with the shovel. The ground was still hard with frost, and it was no easy task to dig the holes.
Papa dug, Mama followed with plants. Tom carried a bucket of water and poured a little into each hole. Papa shoveled the hard dirt back into the hole and firmed it gently around the tender roots.
The children watched and surveyed the project. An irregular line of six apple trees was soon plainly visible.
Warm weather and spring came to our valley. How good it was to open the kitchen door and let the clean, warm air in.
The little ones, no longer under foot, were happy to play out of doors.
If we children had forgotten about our apple orchard, Mama and Papa had not. Every few days they would go out to the trees and examine each one for any signs of growth.
Several weeks passed, and then little green shoots were visible coming out along the brown stems of four of them. Two looked dead and they were.
The remaining little trees put on good growth that summer and by fall were healthy looking.
We learned from a neighbor who had lived for a time in Washington where apple raising was a business, that it took four or five years to produce fruit.
We children lost interest. Green peas in pods and crisp sweet carrots claimed our attention.
The summers came and went. Two more prize trees were killed by animals. Just two remained to remind us of our venture.
It happened the last of May just before Memorial Day!
Pink and white blossoms came out on each twig and stem of the two trees. They were beautiful to behold after a long cold winter.
It seemed as if they had come to tell us that spring had come again. The trees were small but indeed, "popcorn on the apple tree."
I asked Mama if we could pick a bouquet for grandma's grave. She replied, "No, each flower means an apple. Grandma would understand."
On Memorial Day a cold wind blew from the north.
That night Papa built a fire in the new fireplace to warm us up after our trip to the cemetery. No doubt about it there was going to be a frost.
We would go out and cover the precious trees with blankets. Tom and I knew who the "we" meant, so we put on our coats, scarves, and gloves.
As we stepped out into the cold wind it seemed to pierce our very bones. Papa said, "We may as well go back to the house. A few blankets will not keep out this frost."
"We can try," urged Mama. She kept right on going to the garden, the blankets dragging behind. Papa, Tom, and I tried to keep up with her.
There was no stopping Mama when she decided. We followed behind, freezing as we went.

The experience of trying to drape blankets around a tree with the wind blowing a forty-mile gale, with hands and face freezing until they were numb, is a never-to-be-forgotten one. The blankets couldn't be adjusted or made to stay in place. We did the best we could. Papa shook his head as we went back to the house and fire, muttering along the way, "Won't do a bit of good." The following morning, along with other perishable crops, the blossoms on our trees were frozen stiff. The sun came out and they all turned brown and dropped off. "Maybe next year things will be different," Papa said. It is the hope of another year that keeps farmers from giving up. "Yes," Mama spoke reassuringly, "let us not complain, we have so many things for which to be grateful." Mama was like that, always looking on the bright side, giving comfort especially where Papa was concerned. It could be a part of apples, a field of grain destroyed or a drop in the price of eggs. She would give Papa a pat on the back and with a sweet smile say, "Our children are healthy and strong and we have many of them to bless us. We will manage." The following spring was a wonderful warm season. The sun came out bright, melting the snow from the nearby mountains. Water ran in little rivulets into the yard and down the path and the roads. We picked buttercups on our way home from school. One day we saw a robin and stopped to watch her pull a big fat worm from the earth. The apple trees were again white and pink in their new spring dresses, edged in gay green. It did not freeze. By the end of July little green apples hung from every twig and branch of the apple trees. When they were no larger than marbles Tom and I took a salt shaker out under the trees to sample a few. Mama didn't let on that she knew. They were sour and hard, but with a generous amount of salt sprinkled on each bite no one complained of a stomach-ache. They came from our very own trees and how we did enjoy them! The apples grew and Mama thought we could pick a panful for apple dumplings. Mama's apple dumplings made from green apples were a long-remembered treat. Each piece of rich dough would be rolled thin as paper and as large as your hand extended wide from the little finger to the thumb measured on the dough itself. The apples were peeled, quartered, and sliced, then mixed with sugar and cinnamon. A generous amount of butter went into the center of each square of dough, along with the apple mixture. The corners of the dough were pulled together around the filling and dropped into hot water and cooked until fluffy and tender. Served with cream, they were a dish fit for the table of a king. Pie for Sunday dinner came from another pan of apples. Fresh applesauce was the treat on another occasion. It was time to harvest our crop, that is, what there was left of it. Each golden apple was picked as carefully as if it had been an egg and laid in a box. I was sent to the house for a pan. Soon I found out why. "Carry these to widow Taylor," Mama directed. Off went one of the boys with the fruit and returned with the empty pan. Once again it was filled. "These go over to Martha's and Will's house," said Mama. Tom ran to our neighbor on the north and returned again with the empty pan. When four such trips had been made, I opened my mouth to object. "Five years. For apples and give them away?" "Hush," chided Mama. "Think of the fine meals we have had already, waiting for them to ripen." "There is such satisfaction in growing one's food," spoke Mama as we carried one last pan of apples to the house. "We shall invite Ed and Mary over for Sunday dinner and have apple pie." Mama's voice was happy. Papa followed her in. Hobby Feature ought joy to many through her handwork. Although quilting is her favorite pastime, she also does beautiful crocheting and embroidering. Sister Crow has donated countless quilts to Relief Society bazaars, and her intricate crocheted tablecloths and bedspreads have caught many an eye. She has served as quilting chairman in Relief Society, helping many others to learn this art. Sister Crow is the mother of eight children; she has twenty-three grandchildren and five great-grandchildren, in whom she takes great delight. Clara Lewis Hall, McCammon Ward, Portneuf Stake, Idaho, has used her writing talent to enrich the lives of her many friends and family members, as well as to contribute to the community and to the Church building funds. A beautifully written history of McCammon, complete with pictures, was researched and compiled by Sister Hall. The bishopric sponsored the publication, and proceeds went toward furnishing an organ for the chapel. She has fifty volumes of her work to be passed on to her family. Her writing includes family histories, poems, words to songs, and religious pageants. In addition to her writing, Sister Hall has made lovely quilts for each of her nine children, all of her grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, and is currently making them for her eight great-great-grandchildren. She has served for sixty-seven years as a visiting teacher, and has achieved 100 per cent during this current year and many other times.

Jerusha Spends the Night

Hazel K. Todd

Chapter 4

SYNOPSIS: Jerusha, who came to the Wilson home "to spend the night," has become an integral part of the family. Amy has finally made up with Jerusha and the child has come to depend upon her and love her deeply, as have the rest of the family members, excepting Joe, who seems to become increasingly more belligerent, but Jerusha remains unswayed in her determination to win him over.

In the middle of the week Ruth Johnson called Jerusha to invite her to a quilting at her home. "A very special niece of mine, who teaches school in California has consented to spend the remainder of her vacation with us, and I thought it would be a good chance for her to get acquainted with some of my friends." Jerusha glowed with pleasure. "I am so happy you'd include me," she said. "I'd just love to come." And then something popped into her head. "And I'd love to bring a pan of fresh gingerbread with some whipping cream for lunch. I've been feeding it to the family, and they love it."

"Wonderful!" Ruth said. "I might have known you'd come up with something."

On the day of the quilting Jerusha made two pans of gingerbread, one for the family, and one for the party. She left her best wishes with Suzey.

"It'll do you good to be on your own once in awhile with just your family," she said. "Maybe you could put the hem in your dress we just finished. It's all measured, you know." She kissed Amy and promised to tell her an extra long story at bedtime, waved at Dennis working in the yard where he had promised to trim the grass around the edge of the flower beds, and stole a sigh-laden glance at young Joe driving a tractor into the field. "Take the car," Paul said before he left for work. "There's no need of your having people pick you up everywhere you go." 

Erusha fit in with her new friends as though she had always belonged. And she was delighted with the niece, Lynn Barlow. She was a friendly person with brown waving hair and wide gray eyes that sparkled with vitality. Years of teaching English to eighth and ninth graders had given her a world of experience to share. She had escapades to tell of so many Marys and Johnnies that she kept the ladies pleasantly entertained more than her share of the time. "They're all so different," she said, "and yet so much alike. Each one can come up with a new angle to try you. And yet they are all youngsters wanting love and acceptance. Just like my prize, Craig. He did things all winter to exasperate me—Jerusha spent the night thumbtacks in my chair, hiding erasers, and teasing everyone around him. And yet on the last day of school here he comes with a note asking forgiveness for all the trouble he'd caused and wanting me to tell him all about the 'Badlands' of Utah next year. So I have to take a trip to the 'Badlands' while I'm here just so I can have something to hang over Craig's head because I'm sure to get him in my room next year." Jerusha found herself wondering ironically if she took a trip to the 'Badlands' if she could hang it over Joe's head some way to make him accept her. Exploring another angle of such a situation, she remarked, "It's wise you didn't invite him to come with you on such an excursion. He might have decided to push you over." "Over Dead Horse Point?" Lynn laughed contagiously. "And all the time he'd really not want to break my poor body in pieces on the rocks." Jerusha made a mental comparative analysis and decided Joe didn't fit in Craig's classification because he'd probably like to break her into bits with no reservation.

Lunch was delightful. Everyone enjoyed the gingerbread. Lynn insisted on having the recipe, but wheels were turning in Jerusha's head. She had a better idea. "I'll tell you what," she said, "you come out to the Wilsons' farm and have dinner with us, and I'll let you make the gingerbread just to make sure you give it the right touch under the tutorship of an expert." "Why, how nice!" Lynn said. 303 April 1970

"TI'd love to. Just name the day," she replied.

"I'll call you," Jerusha promised, making a mental note to be sure it would be on a day when Paul Wilson would be at the dinner table and not somewhere else on business or to a church meeting.

Ruth saw Jerusha to her car. Jerusha climbed in and perched herself atop the sofa pillow. She turned then with her tongue in her cheek and met Ruth's accusing smile. "Your niece is a right interesting person," she said innocently. "How come she's never married yet? Not that she's old and dried up like me, but" She's twenty-eight," Ruth said. "And she's just never found the right one, I guess. What else?" 

"Oh, nothing, nothing," Jerusha said nonchalantly. "TI know you have some ideas," Ruth laughed. "Well," Jerusha said, with her foot stretched to reach the starter, "get on the band wagon. Maybe we could make beautiful music together."

"I've invited a guest to dinner some evening," Jerusha announced at the breakfast table the morning after the quilting. "A niece of the Johnsons who's spending the remainder of her summer vacation with them." She was conscious of Joe's scowl of disapproval, but she continued as though he had simply smiled at her. "She teaches English in California, and she is a very interesting person."

"Maybe I can learn a few things about English," Suzey laughed. "It's my hardest subject."

"Most likely she'll correct everything you say, till you don't dare talk," Joe offered. "That's the way English teachers do."

"Oh, I don't believe it would be that bad, Joe," Mr. Wilson said. "I think it's a nice gesture to make her feel at home in the ward. We'll be glad to have her come, Jerusha." 

"Thank you," she said. "Now, how about the day? This is a family invitation, you know. How would next Wednesday be for everybody? I know Suzey goes to MIA camp the next week, so this week should do for her."

Paul thought a minute. "That's fine with me," he said and looked at Joe sitting glumly silent. "How about you, Joe?"

"Does it matter?" he answered with his eyes glued on his plate.

"Joe!" Paul said rather sternly, concern on his face. Joe looked up fleetingly. "Okay," he mumbled.

"What'll we have for dessert?" Dennis asked, particular days not mattering to him as long as they held something good to eat. "Gingerbread," Jerusha said. "She wants to try out the recipe herself."

"Um-um." Dennis smacked his lips. "I hope she makes it as good as you do."

"I'm going to stand right over her with a whip while she does it," Jerusha laughed. "It'll probably be better than when I do it alone."

When Wednesday came, everyone seemed particularly solicitous but Joe, who kept his usual distance. Paul suggested sending a sandwich with Joe and him for lunch and promised not to keep dinner waiting. Suzey, always willing, was particularly anxious to help. With Jerusha's instructions she made a lovely set salad and decorated it with mint leaves and maraschino cherries Jerusha had made from the cherry tree in the orchard. Amy, sensing something special in the air, stayed even closer to Jerusha.

Dennis came from the ridge in the field where Paul had sent him to check on the prairie dog traps, carrying an armful of bluebells sprinkled with yellow stinkweed flowers. Which made Suzey cover her mouth with her hand to keep from laughing. Jerusha gave her a silencing wink.

"Wonderful!" she said, be- bestowing an extravagant smile on Dennis. "You remembered we needed flowers for the table on special occasions."

Dennis grinned. She handed him a pair of kitchen shears.

"Now, why don't you find me some fresh parsley for the roast," Jerusha said after he was gone, as she arranged them in a vase, sorting out the others.

"We'll just substitute a few of those late yellow roses for the stinkweeds and Dennis won't know the difference."

In the afternoon the guest arrived.

She stepped lithely from her car, wearing a cool flowered dress with a white ruffly apron. She looked fresh and alive as Jerusha met her at the door. "Well, here I am," she announced enthusiastically. "'The Gingerbread Woman instead of the Gingerbread Man, all ready to run away into a bowl of molasses and ginger." Dennis, standing by with big eyes and ears, snickered and ducked his head. "It's all ready for you," Jerusha assured her, "and young Dennis here has you on probation, so it had better be good." Lynn walked over, put her arm playfully around his neck and whirled him around. "Oh, so you have, have you! Well, let me assure you, young man, this gingerbread will be so good, you'll never allow Jerusha to make it any more. You'll be sending clear to California for me!" "T hope so," Jerusha remarked with her back to them so they did not hear. "Banana so the gingerbread got on its way with joviality and fun." Suzey was the age of scores of young girls Lynn had taught, so Lynn knew just how to make her feel at home. It was no time at all until they were chatting freely. Dennis, whose nonchalant style nobody ruffled, watched the procedure with a growing appetite. And once when nobody saw but Jerusha who pretended she didn't, he swiped his finger through the dough and stuck it into his mouth. But Amy, having refused to be cajoled in any way by the visitor, slipped away with her doll, even forsaking Jerusha. Near dinnertime Paul and Joe came from the field. Watching through the window, Jerusha wondered just what Joe would do. But he came in with his father. She had half expected him to be missing for dinner. But she understood Paul's concern about Joe. He had mentioned it to her. "I don't know what's got into him," he said. "He never used to be like this." Lynn was standing by the cupboard counter cutting the warm gingerbread into squares when they came in. The sun through any of the window was shining on her hair, making it glisten with soft mellow lights. She turned, and her wide gray eyes sparkled with friendliness. "Miss Lynn Barlow," Jerusha began, thinking she was as excited herself as if she had swallowed a jumping-jack, "I want you to meet Paul Wilson and his son Joe." Paul smiled cordially and put out his hand. "We are very happy to have you, Miss Barlow," he said. She took it gracefully. "I always make myself at home," 306 she said with a glance at her apron. And then she turned to Joe standing glumly silent. She looked appraisingly up and down his physique. "Basketball, football, or track?" she asked pleasantly. He hesitated a minute. "What makes you think I do any of them?" She laughed, an easy pleasant laugh. "Oh, just the law of all young men," she said. "They nearly all try one or the other or all three. Some of them can't keep the training, or the grades, but they all want to." Jerusha felt more than she saw Joe's quick glance in her direction. But she made no sign of concern. "T guess I like football," Joe said. And then he added defensively, "'And I don't like English." Paul turned to him quickly. But Lynn didn't seem to mind at all. She laughed again. "No, I don't suppose so," she said casually. "Most boys don't. To them a verb is just some outlandish bug-a-boo that nobody needs." "That's right," he said, "What good are they?" Lynn shrugged. "Oh, let's not get into that now. I'd think I was in the schoolroom, and this is my vacation." Jerusha had been listening with interest. Now she excused herself and went to find Amy. The little girl was sitting on the bench under the willow tree telling her doll a story about a Clackety Man. Seeing her friend, she ran to Jerusha's outstretched arms. Dinner was pleasant and entertaining. They talked about everything from the salad Suzey had decorated so attractively, making her blush with embarrassed pleasure, to football and the "Badlands" of Utah. Jerusha Spends the Night "I wish I could go there," Dennis said, helping himself to another roll and plastering it with butter. "Well, come along," Lynn said, 'Join the party." "Honest?" Dennis said, letting his knife slip out of his hand to the floor, "could I?" "Now," Paul answered, embarrassed at his son's forwardness, "I'm sure Miss Barlow was joking. She probably has her trip all planned without a small fry like you to complicate things." "But I won't complicate anything," Dennis promised in dead seriousness. "As a matter of fact," Lynn said, laughingly, looking first at Dennis and then at Paul. "I don't even have the party organized yet. I don't see why I couldn't include Dennis. He could just fit in as a piece of chinking in some crack." (To be continued) WHEN CATTLE PASS I hear the cattle coming up the slope; Their placid lowing, the rising cloud of dust. Are sound and scent of summer Rounding the final bend. In my remembering, when harebells bloomed Against the greening banks of warming earth, | opened wide the shutters on my days To all that winged or sang; Yet | could weep for the too early bud Ice sabered, Or broken under snow. | Am more patient now with sullen moods Of winter loath to leave; For always cattle come in their own time, Finding the narrow hoof-deciphered trails To mountain meadows of a high brief summer— And certain is the flowering in The grass When cattle pass.

INTRODUCTION There is probably no fragrance more pleasantly nostalgic to any of us than that of freshly baked homemade bread and no combination of foods more satisfying to our taste buds than that of bread and honey. Not only are these foods good to the taste, they are also inexpensive, wholesome, and nutritious. They are highly recommended among the basic foods that we should include in our home storage program.

Such phrases as "the staff of life," "wheat for man," "earn our bread," "land of milk and honey," and others are familiar to all of us, and they are indicative of the importance of these foods in our daily diet. Nutritional experts tell us that foods made from wheat contribute about one-fourth of the total energy requirements of the American people and that in some European countries the wheat products are nearly twice as great. Likewise honey and molasses have been used the world over for generations as basic supplements to our nutritional needs.

SOME USES OF WHEAT (Wheat may be used whole, cracked, or ground into flour.)

1. Bulgur Recipe
1. Wash wheat in cool water and pour off the water.
2. Add enough water barely to cover wheat and boil until water is absorbed and wheat is tender. (35 to 45 minutes.)
3. Spread wheat thinly in shallow pan or on cookie sheet and dry in 200 degree oven until very dry, so that it will crack easily.
4. Wet surface of dried wheat slightly and rub kernels between hands to loosen and remove chaff. (Very little nutritional value will be lost.)
5. Crack wheat into moderate size pieces using mill or grinder or even mortar and pestle. In some cases the wheat may be left whole to retain a chewy quality. Bulgur can be used in any recipe calling for cracked wheat or bulgur. (A book of bulgur recipes is available on request from Western Regional Research Laboratory, 800 Buchanan Street, Albany, California 94710.)

2. Cracked Wheat Bread (Five loaves.)
5 cups unsifted cracked wheat flour
6 to 7 cups sifted all-purpose flour
2 packages dry yeast
1 cup milk (reconstituted powdered milk may be used)
3 cups warm water
2 tbsp. Melted shortening
4 tsps. Salt
3 tbsp. Sugar (or 1/4 cup honey or molasses)

Place dry ingredients together in large pan. Sprinkle yeast over water and add one tablespoon of sugar. (Do not stir.) Then add the milk and shortening and mix with the dry ingredients until the dough leaves the sides of the pan. Knead the dough until smooth. Rub shortening on hands through kneading process as dough will be slightly sticky. Grease top of bread. Cover and let rise in warm place free from drafts. Allow bread to double in bulk. Punch down and let rise again to double.

Preheat oven Lesson Department to 400 degrees. Shape each loaf and place in lightly greased bread pans. Cover and let rise until dough reaches top of pans. Bake 40 to 50 minutes. Remove from pans immediately and grease sides and top. Cover completely with towel and invert hot pans on top of each loaf.

3. Whole Wheat Cereal
1 cup clean whole wheat
1 tsp. Salt
2 cups water

Put above ingredients into top of double boiler and leave uncovered. Bring water in bottom of boiler to full rolling boil and boil for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to low and let simmer overnight. (Any unused portion can be kept in refrigerator and reheated.)

4. Sprouted Wheat (good source of vitamin C.)
Place soft cloth on bottom of tray or cookie sheet. Sprinkle with wheat and cover with another cloth. Keep damp by sprinkling two or three times daily. Set in dark place at about 70 degrees temperature for two to four days. (May be used in stews, soups, salads, casseroles, etc.)

Note: All good cookbooks contain recipes using wheat and wheat products.

HONEY
Honey itself is a nutritious food used as a spread, topping, or confection. It can be used as a substitute for sugar or other sweetener in almost any recipe—in breads, in cakes and cookies, in frostings, fillings, sauces, and dressings, and in puddings and other desserts. Cooked to hard-crack stage and stretched like taffy, with vanilla added, honey makes a delicious old-fashioned candy favorite.

1. Honey Cream Sauce
Mix in small saucepan:
2 tbsp. Melted butter
2 tsp. Cornstarch
1 cup honey

Cook 5 minutes (for puddings, ice cream topping, etc.)

2. Pineapple Honey Dressing
Mix and shake well:
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/8 tsp. Salt
3 tbsp. Crushed pineapple (for fruit salads.)

MOLASSES
Molasses has long been a favorite of good cooks for its versatile uses in cookies, candies, popcorn balls, gingerbreads, cakes, and puddings.

1. Old-Fashioned Molasses Cookies
Set oven at 375 degrees.
Cream together:
1/2 cup shortening
1/2 cup butter
1/4 cup brown sugar

Add 1 egg slightly beaten
1/4 cup molasses
1/4 cup milk

Sift together and add:
2 cups flour
1/2 tsp. Salt
1/8 tsp. Ginger or cloves
1/8 tsp. Cinnamon
1 tsp. Baking soda

Put spoonfuls on cookie sheet and bake about 10 minutes. Rolled cookies can be made by adding enough more flour (about 4-4 cup) to handle.

2. Molasses added to milk makes a nutritious drink for children.

NOTES
It has been suggested that if a food is to be stored, a taste for that food should be developed before an emergency arises. A reliable family wheat mill or grinder is recommended as a valuable addition to our storage program. These are available at various hardware and emergency food supply stores.

REFLECTION OF LIGHT
God gave his Son
To speed the day
When | in light,
Could find the way.
Can | do less?
My sons must go
To other sheep
To let them know!

He gave the gift to all
Eternal life can we
Do less for him who said
"Here am I, send me!"

We have sent three sons
Our blessings manifold
And count it not as sacrifice
This great rejoicing in the fold.

Compiled by his son. A warning voice urging LDS members to observe gospel laws if they would gain eternal rewards. This is the first and only time in this dispensation that both a father and son have become president of the Church. These two books were compiled and written by President Joseph Fielding Smith, grandson of Church Patriarch Hyrum Smith, who was a brother of the Prophet Joseph. In The Life of Joseph F. Smith, President Smith has compiled the speeches of his father along with his early history, which parallels the persecution, early history and growth of the Church. In his youth he was surrounded by a spirit of hate and vile wickedness, yet he grew to become a man of faith, integrity, love and leadership as the sixth president of the Church. $4.95 DESERET BOOK COMPANY Take Heed to Yourselves was written by President Smith as a warning that the time is short in which to prepare for the second coming of the Savior. He writes about timely and vital subjects as he cries repentance, following the Savior's instructions to the original twelve apostles. $4.95 44 East South Temple, Salt Lake City, Utah 84110, or 777 South Main, Orange, California 92668 Please send me _JA copies of 1 � 2 Also include 25� for each book ordered to cover handling and mailing.
