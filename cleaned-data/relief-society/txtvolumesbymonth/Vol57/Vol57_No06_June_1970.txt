ON EVENING WINGS
All places are edges, save where you are—
All, periphery and perimeter, you the hub—
All places rims and horizons
And spokes extending from you.
Yet so gentle you are, meadowed
In the matrix where my tether is staked—
Buttercup-yellow, new-green and meadow-fresh.
How gossamer the slender filament between us,
Yet how magnet and center you are for me.
Even above summits | hear you, and at sea,
From sand and season and all petaled flowering.
From horizoned far and purple distance
Lights beckon in a glowing circle
Beyond which | am not moved to remain.
With evening | return
To hover around the memory of you,
Back to the tether of your warmth,
To the valley of meanings
Taller than this stony triumph over cliffs.
From acquaintance with clouds | come,
Down the torn edges of thunder,
Always returning on evening wings.

Shelter, you are to me,
Yet all freedom. —Dorothy J. Roberts

What a thrill it was to see the short story "Testimony Meeting" (January 1970) by my friend Anna Kivekas, in print! I am sure all the sisters living in the mission fields feel closer to the Church when they see that one of them from a far place has an item printed in the Magazine. I enjoy the Magazine.
Margreta C. I. Spencer, Safad, Israel

My mother and I do so enjoy The Relief Society Magazine and look forward to each issue, even though they arrive late and not always regularly.
Diana Barry, Sanne, Switzerland

The Relief Society Magazine is very popular on the Ricks College campus. I was walking down the foyer recently and noticed several young men reading the Magazine. The young women appreciate the beautiful lessons printed therein "for their benefit and good."
Lisle L. Andrus, President, Ricks College First Stake Relief Society, Rexburg, Idaho

Both my husband and I want to express our gratitude for the wonderful Relief Society Magazine. Being a fairly recent convert to the Church, my association with the Magazine has been brief, but I have truly enjoyed all the issues I have read.
As Peace Corps volunteers in Bahia, Brasil, we were completely isolated from the Church until we received the Magazine from my dear mother-in-law, and then you cannot imagine our joy and feeling of closeness with those at home. We simply devour the Magazine—cover to cover. We enjoy every part, from recipes, to poetry, to lessons.
The boost to our spiritual and mental morale is wonderful. Thank you for making all our days so much brighter and bringing the happiness of the gospel to this part of the world.
Jannie N. Hall, Itajuipe, Bahia, Brasil

Thank you. So much for The Relief Society Magazine. Being a new member of the Church, taking the Magazine has helped me to understand the full purpose of Relief Society.
Miss C. De la Torre, Cambridge, England

This terrific Magazine has been sent to my mother, Mrs. Bertha Young, by our Mormon friends Mr. and Mrs. Alex Gillespie. We are not of your religion, but if we were to make a change, we would certainly look into the Mormon faith.
We read the Magazine from cover to cover, and we have learned so much.
Betty Young Weese, Middletown, New York

In Italy I became interested in the study of the Madonna and have observed and studied over the years the Madonna cover pictures presented in the December issues of the Magazine, and hope that this beautiful tradition may continue. What a wonderful and blessed influence throughout the Church and the world, the Magazine continues to exert, and I am sure our dear Lord is pleased.
I was pleased with Betty Madsen's "Christmas Lullaby" and the "Madonna Keepsakes" article, and loved the editorial "We Have Seen His Star," by Vesta P. Crawford—the warmth and simplicity— the timeliness and inspiration are splendid.
LaVerne Stallings, Salt Lake City, Utah

The Relief Society Magazine has been an inspiration to me, and I have learned a special appreciation for it here in Taiwan. It has helped me with our Relief Society lessons, for we are just five sisters holding meetings once each week in our homes. The Chinese sisters look in amazement at the lovely colored pictures and the handmade articles.
We appreciate the messages from the General Authorities. The colored picture of the Salt Lake Temple at Christmas time (December Magazine) was beautiful. We are blessed to be members of Relief Society and to have the Magazine.

PHOTOGRAPH BY Se: Vi) Written P But; to t, 'V© fathered. 4 end VOL Ain inle leat "Rise and Shine" Marian R. Boyer Member, General Board of Relief Society

LeGrand Richards and his wife Ina Ashton Richards at the time of their 50th wedding anniversary. They have since celebrated their 60th anniversary.

Nearly every morning of my childhood I was awakened by my father calling from the bottom of the stairs, "Rise and shine. Get up and put on your beautiful garments." Father has habitually been an early riser. The sound of water in the shower or from the hose outside has always been accompanied by Father's less than melodious voice. In true operatic fashion he serenaded us with such songs as "Nellie Bly Caught a Fly and Tied It to the Sky," "She's Only a Bird in a Gilded Cage, a Beautiful Sight to See," and "Two Little Girls in Blue." His days always commenced as he has lived his life—with faith, enthusiasm, and "gusto."

I would have to admit 410 his love for the Church and Heavenly Father came first, with the family a close second. In fact, Mother always claimed she was married to the family and Father to the Church. Father was taught the closeness of family ties in his own home. There were fifteen brothers and sisters who were devoted to each other. They were guided by a loving father and mother.

A favorite story of mine, which Father tells, occurred at Christmas time when he was working in Salt Lake City and his father's family was living in Tooele. It had been a tradition for the family to be together for the holidays. Arrangements had been made for Father to catch the late train for home on Christmas Eve. It took longer than usual for him to finish his work so he missed the train. The thought of not being with the family being a dreary prospect, he hired a horse and undertook the forty-mile trip on horseback. It was a cold night, with heavy snow falling. He wondered if he had been foolish to attempt such a journey and nearly turned back several times. The wind whipped the snow and seemed determined to keep him from his destination. When the train arrived in Tooele without him, Grandfather (George F. Richards) knew that Father would try to reach home some other way. One of the boys in the family was sent by horse and buggy to find the nearly frozen traveler. As Father was wrapped in blankets and settled in the buggy, he remarked to his rescuer, "I knew Father would send someone."

The same family closeness carried over into our own home. We had family nights when I was very young, usually with our own family, but sometimes with other families in the ward. Fast day was always a special day. Father, when bishop of Sugar House Ward, let the children of the family help count the fast offerings and tithing. In those days donations were not made by check, but in silver and greenbacks. In fact, I even remember a few gold pieces. What fun the family had around the dining room table making stacks of coins and piles of greenbacks! How proud we felt when we were given the responsibility of counting the money!

Many lessons were learned and experiences related as the tithing was carefully counted and put in bags for delivery to the bank in the morning. Father always put the bags in the pan cupboard saying that if anyone tried to take them, at least he would be sure to hear.

Many of the best times the family had centered around Church activity. As we were growing up a new meetinghouse was built. We were "permitted" to donate our war bonds to the building fund to pay for a bench in the chapel. I have memories of taking lemonade to the ward for the men working there; of Mother making pies for the carnival given to raise money; and of the whole family being involved in every project. We were proud of our father as the bishop, even though we resented constantly being reminded of our responsibility to be good examples to the other ward members.

As children we lovingly called our father "Busy Shop" instead of bishop. A few years after the chapel was built and the organizations were running smoothly, the call was made in General Conference for men to go on a six months' mission. Typical of Father, he volunteered. This was his third mission. His first mission, as a young man, was in Holland. A few years later he returned to Holland as president of the mission. At this time there were three children in the family (all girls). Another girl was born while we were there.

By the time Father went on his third mission, which was to the Eastern States, the family had four, each player attempts to pull the other over by locking inside legs. This has been a favorite sport of Father's. He has achieved an agility and never have I seen anyone able to throw him. This day Father made short work of some of the older boys. He threw them over quickly and then challenged one of the grandsons who had a job working with a jackhammer to acquire physical fitness for football in the fall. On the first try, Father flipped him over easily. I believe the young man was a little afraid of his own strength as compared with that of his grandfather. On the second try the football player was again flipped over. After the third time we proclaimed Father the champion Indian Wrestler. He still reigns supreme.

The memory of my father will live in the lives of many by reason of his missionary zeal and Church activity, but I shall always remember him for his love of family and children. At Christmas time it is traditional for him to carry a bag of silver dollars for the little ones. He delights in hearing the children sing the Primary song, "I Always Have a Happy Feeling When I Go to Church." I shall always remember the precious letters I have received from him on Mother's Day, but most of all, I shall always be grateful for Father who has strengthened our eternal family ties by officiating at the marriage of four of our children in the temple.

These are some of the sweet remembrances I have of my father. SEA SONG | walked tonight beside the restless sea Alone beside you, in a world apart, And felt the ebb and flow of heart to heart That gilded us as moonlight gilds the sea. The tide was coming in.

And on the sand I traced a message for your eyes to see You would not read, but smiling gazed at me. I knew you read my heart if not my hand. The tide came in. We watched until it went Again to sea, leaving the landscape bare Except for treasure shells laid here and there— The sea's fair price to land for sand-space rent. My words were gone; the sea left not a trace. But still my message shone upon your face.

EDITORIAL / THE 140th ANNUAL
The 140th Annual General Conference of the Church, April 4, 5, 6, 1970, was held in the great Tabernacle in Salt Lake City. Marking the 150th anniversary year of the First Vision to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the conference was significant in emphasizing the divinely directed continuity of leadership and authority and the great growth within the Church.

In a Solemn Assembly on Monday, April 6th, President Joseph Fielding Smith was sustained as the tenth President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and as prophet, seer, and revelator. Each quorum of the priesthood individually, beginning with the First Presidency, and then the general assembly, gave unanimous sustaining votes.

Greatly beloved for his wisdom, counsel, and sixty years of devoted and faithful leadership, President Joseph Fielding Smith, grandson of the Patriarch Hyrum Smith (brother of the Prophet Joseph), comes to his office bearing the heritage of divinely directed leadership, as well as the legacy of devotion to the gospel. President Harold B. Lee and President N. Eldon Tanner were sustained as first and second counselors, respectively, in the First Presidency. Elder Boyd K. Packer, an Assistant to the Council of the Twelve, was sustained as a member of the Council of the Twelve. Three Assistants to the Council were sustained: Elder Joseph Anderson, Elder David B. Haight, and Elder William H. Bennett.

In a time of radiant spring weather, greening hills and flowering valleys, the report of growth in Church membership came to the saints as a reminder of the restoration and the labors of missionaries for one hundred and forty years. President Smith in the opening session of the conference expressed his gratitude for the restoration of the gospel:

"I am grateful beyond any measure of expression for the blessings the Lord has given to me, and to the faithful members of His Church in the various nations of the earth, and to all His children everywhere."

Jennie R. Scott Resigns From General Board of Relief Society
Relief Society sisters throughout the world will miss the influence of Jennie Randall Scott in her work as a member of the General Board of Relief Society since her call to fulfill a mission with her husband to the Cumorah Mission. They have been assigned to assist in the Hill Cumorah visitors center. Sister Scott served on the Board from September 2, 1959 until her release, March 11, 1970. During these ten years she has given outstanding service in all aspects of Relief Society. She has served on the education committees, special lessons for Lamanites, and has represented Relief Society on civic bodies and private social agencies. She gave valued support to the Relief Society social service volunteers. She has always undertaken the varied and many assignments given to her in a spirit of humility and performed the assignments admirably and with quiet efficiency.

Sister Scott and her husband are well-suited to missionary service. They met while serving in the Western States Mission. The united love and best wishes of the General Board go with them as they continue in unselfish service to the Lord. May they find fulfillment and joy in this new calling and receive the blessings they so richly deserve.

BEYOND THEIR DREAMING
The dream precedes the fact, they always say,
And boys in very fact will often stay
In leafy tree-houses through day on day,
While dreams of being birds in flight will stray
Across their buoyant vision late or soon.
And then some year they rise and fly away
To scan the polar ice; to quote the Word
In awesome, happy voices out of space
And in the distant solitude they trace
The handiwork of God upon the face
Of the long-dreamed-of landmarks of the moon,
In flight beyond the ken of any bird!

Birthday Congratulations to Emma Ray Riggs McKay
The General Board of Relief Society and sisters throughout the world wish Sister Emma Ray Riggs McKay a happy ninety-third birthday. Relief Society women have long looked to Sister McKay as an example of outstanding womanhood. She has reared her family in grace and dignity, ever preserving the sanctity of the home. Her marriage to President McKay has always been looked upon as exemplary and she was ever in his thoughts. In the time since the passing of President McKay, Sister McKay has continued to reign as beloved mother, grandmother and great-grandmother to a great posterity, her influence still powerful, and her sadness lightened by her knowledge of gospel truths.

Throughout this coming year may she enjoy good health and happy associations with her loved ones. May her birthday be one of contentment and rewarding memories.

Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain and Senator Margaret Chase Smith of the United States have both placed on the Gallup Poll's list of the World's Ten Most Admired Women annually since the list was first published twenty-seven years ago. Fifteen hundred and eleven adult men and women chose the 1969 list.

On the list of most admired women or the ten runners-up were such differing individuals as Mrs. Golda Meir, Madame Ghandi of India (both admired for the way they handle their difficult premierships), Mrs. Pat Nixon, Pauline Frederick, Mrs. Martin Luther King, Helen Hays, Pearl Buck, and Sylvia Porter. Most winners are outstanding for their humanitarianism.

Beth Ryan, at the age of fifty-eight, left her Portland, Oregon, field of journalism and became for two years a staff writer on the English-language China Post, a newspaper with a present circulation of fifty thousand, in Taipei, Republic of China. The newspaper-oriented Huang Family started the China Post eighteen years ago, and today brilliant Nancy Huang is the publisher.

Mrs. Ryan found some fabulous women in China. Notes on a few follow:

Dr. Wen-yah Koo, who teaches pharmacology at Taiwan University Medical College, has analyzed thousands of Chinese herbs. She—carefully collects, cures, and stores them, and even raises some. For eighteen months she worked in a hospital laboratory on Long Island, New York, assisting with cancer research using some Chinese herbs. One deterred the growth of cancer in rats, but required continued research. Her book, A Study of Chinese Drugs, won a $1,000 prize in China and awaits publication in English.

Ruth Wright, who was the first dean of students at an American coeducational college (City College of New York), has been director of studies at the Language Center, a subsidiary of Taiwan University, where college graduates learn English to meet the needs of local business. She selected and trained the teachers.

Mrs. Lillian Dickson, world-famous founder of Mustard Seed, Incorporated, has worked out of Taiwan since 1927. "Mustard Seed projects dot Taiwan with hospitals, maternity wards, clinics, leprosariums, TB sanitariums, trade schools for boys and for girls, kindergartens, homes for orphans, babies, and boys and girls released from prisons, blind girls, handicraft centers, training for kindergarten teachers and nurses' aids."

Mrs. Nora Chu, a women's normal college president, took time to lunch, in rotation, with every student and her counselor.

A majority of the homemakers in Denmark are working commercially in their homes. The high development of arts and crafts accounts for a considerable amount of this domestic industry.

Dr. Clara M. Ambrus, principal research scientist at Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, New York, has reported to the American Cancer Society a new treatment—the outgrowth of research on leukemia—which appears to be effective against hyaline membrane disease. President John F. Kennedy's son Patrick was a victim of this ailment. Research is trying to improve this treatment and make it generally available, cost-wise.

The Law of Nature Is Best Verona Toronto Bowen

The oak-wooded acre was chosen with care and after much deliberation. We wanted to keep the feeling of nature around us. We had lived so many years in the city and our gardening instincts had risen to the surface asking for release. This acre seemed the perfect answer. A young, handsome stand of oaks was the front half of the acre and the back was open to the sun for our home and garden.

I can truly say the acre has never let us down through each joy and lament. We landscaped the front to the delight of squirrels and birds. Then we so placed our breakfast nook and kitchen to share their busy world of flight, food, and song. We put bird baths half hidden in the natural ivy, a perch here and there and feeders for crumbs from the table and chicken scratch feed. The area is just as it was when we bought it except for the addition of some azaleas, rhododendrons, hydrangeas, ferns, and such things compatible to the setting. It is a haven for birds, and often a rabbit is seen hidden in the greens or scurrying about under the trees.

In summer it is cool and in winter it lends protection from the elements, but always it is inviting. A dear friend gave me a birdhouse to put in the trees. We situated it in the tree where we could enjoy the bird family that might move in, and yet it would feel quite unwatched. It was a charming little house, very sturdy, with a perch at the entrance of a very small round doorway. In the trees it looked like a small log cabin suspended in sky and tree.

We were joyous anticipating each day some little owners. We learned it was a little wren house and I looked them up in the bird book and watched to see if we had them in our area. We did, so surely they would find the house and move in. Birds of all kinds flirted with the house, even the big jays and robins, and once a mockingbird.

Then some friends told me if we had the entrance facing the morning sun we would be sure to have some birds move in. My husband moved the entrance to face the morning sun. Day after day went by, and then the summer and the fall, and all the winter it looked bleak, cold, and lonesome.

The next summer was a repeat of the same. After six years we had quite forgotten about the house. This spring while sitting at lunch one day I was suddenly aware of a pair of birds in great activity around the house. I recognized them to be little wrens. They shyly investigated the perch, then the opening, and finally one darted in through the hole. It flew out again. In a few moments it tried going in again and then out. The flight was so quick and with such precision that it was like a little jet. I extended my lunch hour for some time to watch. I was fascinated by the careful scrutiny the wrens gave the little house. I felt like saying to them, "Had I known you would be interested, I would have had it fresh and spring housecleaned for you."

By the second day I knew they had moved in. We were all joyous, enchanted with their antics, and watched them at all sorts of times. We could hear them cheeping in the house, and it was such a welcome sound. At last the little house was occupied. What a happy event!

The blue jays became aware of the house and its occupants. They had always been so possessive of the grove, chasing the other birds away if they could. They flew to the perch, pecking at the hole, making the wrens miserable. Sometimes they perched on the house ready to fly after them when they came out of the house. I cringed at their naughtiness.

Finally, my husband borrowed the neighbor's small gun that was mostly noise. When the jays came around he let them have the noise—not the gun. Being very smart birds, the blue jays got the point and moved over to the neighbor's feeder. All seemed peaceful again, then the English sparrows found the jays were gone and they moved in like a plague. They attacked the wrens, sat on the house, and surrounded it. Never have I seen such miserable, mean little upstarts. They were completely undisturbed by noise—you might have thought they had been brought up on it.

Then I discovered that if I went out with a towel and swooshed their way, they understood and flew away. Of course, they were right back, but so was I. It was a real battle—I waving the towel and they screeching and flying away temporarily. They were so pernicious and determined.

Then I realized that in my zeal I had on occasion probably chased off the wren, too. My great sadness came when I suddenly realized the wrens could cope with it no more—there was no cheep—the house was empty.

Years of waiting and now a coldness in my heart for the dear little lost family. I was not alone in my feelings, for my sorrow was that of our household. All we could hope was that the wrens had found a secure and safe new home.

A great decision crystallized in my thinking. Let nature be and let it solve its own problems and struggles. As in the life of man come the terrifying events and, as the birds' song tells us, reaching up into the heavens—the joyous moments.

The little house had _ been empty for a very long time. I was sitting at lunch in the breakfast nook. A pair of wrens were looking over the house—very interested. Being wiser now—I dared I hope again? Some months later I prepared the bird food, as usual, in the early morning but was surprised to find a handsome pair of doves sitting on the roof of the feeder. While I filled the feeder they flew to a branch of a nearby tree and waited. I came back into the house and watched from the window. Almost immediately the feeder was surrounded with small feathered friends, with the doves sitting on the roof. For months before the coming of the doves the jays had first priority at feeding time and not another bird could come near the feeder until they had finished. They located their nests so they could see the minute I filled the feeder, and they were so bold they flew in often before I had left the area. The jays were so greedy and mean I often threatened to stop the whole bird project. Not a bird could feed until they were plump and full, having taken the choice morsels of cake and cookies. It seemed incredible that the mild, peaceful doves could so command a situation and discipline the feathered world. Often 'they feed with the small birds, but usually they keep guard patiently until the small birds have finished. They then take their turn, and the moment they leave, the jays zero in and eat the leftovers of which there are always plenty.

The house is still vacant, but it has been moved to what we hope will be a more secure spot. The doves seem to have moved into the garden to stay and we hope the peace they brought with them will be permanent. Left to her own, how well nature solves her problems.

Ge SONG FOR SUMMER RAIN

Oh, this is a lovely world the Lord has made; He must have loved us very, very much;
The summer rain has gently washed each blade
Of grass; the roses wear a subtle touch
Of dew today. The skies are gray,
But after summer showers nature hums
Hymns of praises for refreshing cool,
And bluer skies appear, a quiet comes
And my reflection in the wayside pool
Is brighter far Than a summer star,
Or than the summer sun | know is there.
Thanks, Lord, thanks very much that you should
Care this much for me To send the summer rain so blessedly.

421 Hazel K. Todd Chapter 6 @ The week soon passed, and the explorers returned tanned and exhausted, but laden with trophies and happy experiences. Dennis had found himself an unusual bone which he insisted had belonged to a dinosaur, and which he dangled from a rope over his shoulder. "And he won't even give it up for Craig," Lynn laughed. Joe had a sack of arrowheads, and Suzey had a jar of unusual colored rocks that she had plans for making into beads. And there was a pile of loot stacked outside the door.

"It would have taken a truck to haul everything they wanted," Lynn said, "but we could only bring what the guide said was legal. Joe did allow me a very special arrowhead for Craig, and I have plenty of pictures to convince him."

Amy watched from her distance behind the bedroom door, peeking out now and then with wide eyes to share the excitement in her far-off way.

"I brought her something," Lynn said, taking a fringed dark braided doll from her bag, "an Indian doll I got from a trading post."

"Try her," Jerusha said. But Amy closed the door and didn't peek out any more.

"She's always been that way since her mother died," Paul explained. "Jerusha's the only one who's ever been able to win her, outside of the family."

"Lynn has been trying to get her magic formula," Jerusha said. "You give it to her, Jerusha. She will probably take it from you."

"We'll stand it here in the bookcase shelf," Jerusha said, placing the doll in the vacant space by a book.

"I think some day she will accept it from you." Lynn was standing at the door now ready to leave, a very much alive young woman. A lock of her brown hair, blown by the ride, fell over her face, and she brushed it away with a girlish gesture.

"Thank you, Paul Wilson," she said with a sudden seriousness in her wide gray eyes, "for the loan of your family. They're wonderful. We're going again next year, and we've decided to take you along, too."

He was standing there tall and sedate, a handsome sorrow-seasoned man, the depths of his somber eyes alive with a life yet to live.

"Is that so?" he said with a curious smile. "Well, I'll walk you to the car, and we'll talk about it." They left, and Jerusha stood a minute, a half wistful, pleasureful smile spread over her wrinkled face. And then she went to find Amy.

Reading Latter-day Saint literature had become a very stimulating side interest for Jerusha. There was plenty of it around, and she carried it to her room and read in the evenings. She had come to feel quite at home in the meetings and other activities, and found it most enjoyable when she was asked to help with the lunch in Relief Society.

One question after another sent her asking for help. She always had a few special ones for Ruth Johnson, and now with Lynn Barlow, she claimed she had no chance with both of them working on her. Then there was Paul, who was serving a stake mission and had her assigned for his special contact.

Jerusha Spends the Night

So, it came about that one morning at the breakfast table, Jerusha made her announcement.

"Just how do you go about getting yourself baptized?" she asked Paul casually across the table. He put down his fork of scrambled eggs. Tears came to his eyes as he looked at her devotedly.

"Jerusha, this is wonderful!" he said.

Suzey jumped from her chair and came to throw her arms about Jerusha's neck, sobbing happily. Dennis let out a war whoop, upsetting his glass of milk into Jerusha's lap, and Amy clung to her as though she were about to lose her, not quite understanding what it was all about.

"Well, it's about time," Joe said, continuing to eat his food, "but do you all have to mob her?"

Jerusha bestowed an amused smile on Joe. "As a matter of fact," she said, "I didn't intend a simple question to cause quite such a commotion."

But the family insisted it was something to celebrate. So, the following Saturday when Paul baptized her in the Church font, the Johnsons had the family over for dinner and Jerusha was the guest of honor.

"I'm so happy," Ruth said, giving her a big hug. Mr. Johnson added his congratulations, and all the children were pleased.

Lynn's eyes sparkled with friendship. "Now you can never leave, Jerusha. You belong here." Jerusha was silent a moment before she answered thoughtfully, "But you went to California from some Utah town, I understand." "Oh, of course," Lynn smiled. "It don't mean this is the only 423 June 1970 end Mission. Lynn went back to California all Over the World. Just for a short time." Jerusha turned her attention to Amy. "I just want to come back to stay with us." Her eyes danced when she said that, and Jerusha came apart with laughter. When she stopped laughing, Lynn said, "Maybe we could catch you in California Interlude a little Short," he said holding out his hand. "It will help to have you here for a while." She smiled at him wistfully. "Might I be on my own for a while?" Jerusha said. "I'm sure it would be fun." "T've been thinking that, too," Lynn said. "Maybe we could catch you in California next summer and take care of the little tot." Amy cried about going to school at all. She sat down at the table and complained. She turned her fingers on it. She returned nervous and writable. Told you would be difficult for her. She clung to her doll at night, Paul. "I'll never let it out of my sight," she said. "Just have to leave it up to them." Jerusha's story didn't help much, either. Jerusha seemed to enjoy each other's company too, and rode into town with him the other day. Lynn was going to take her little one to school herself that morning. Jerusha spoke to Remy Clung to her with so much motion that the undercurrents were hard to follow. She said, "But pure Lynn is very decided to get together that you might interest her in something." Jerusha seemed interested in him. "Well," he said, "let's try once to accept each other for what we are." Jerusha seemed to enjoy each other's company too, and rode into town with him the other day.

"She was so lonely until you came." Jerusha came and stood by him. "But there is still hope, Paul." He smiled wearily at her, but he said nothing. So the night passed. And when morning came with its new beginnings, Amy had slipped away to her own new day.

Throughout the funeral and the burial, Jerusha was so grateful for her newly found hope and understanding. She knew how it was that Paul could accept his loss in the quiet way he did. She was overwhelmed with the closeness of the ward members, the dishes of food that came to the house. After it was all over, Ruth came and helped Jerusha pack Amy's things away until other arrangements could be made for them. All the little things Jerusha had sewed with so much love, they folded neatly and stored away. The doll that she had clung to for comfort lay with one arm hanging over the bed where it had been tossed the night of the tragedy.

Jerusha picked it up and stared a moment at the new dress she had made for the special day. Then she opened a drawer by her bed and laid the doll carefully in it. There was a long letter from Lynn to the family expressing her deep-felt sympathy. The Johnson's had invited her back for Christmas, and, of course, she would see them then. They read the letter one night at the supper table, each grateful for the newly found friend.

"I wish Amy could have been with us on the trip," Dennis said. "We had so much fun."

JAPAN Lovely Land of Contrasts
Caroline Eyring Miner

INTRODUCTION
Tony, our guide in Kyoto, Japan, the ancient capital, tiptoed up to a wooden box near the big Torii gate, the largest in the world, and threw in some coins. Then he clapped his hands in a pattern of seven claps to draw the attention of the universal gods before he prayed for his heart's desire. With such magic claps, we open this brief account of Japan—lovely land of contrasts.

Japan is a land with the very old and the very new side by side as you will see both in the ancient kimonos and westernized costumes which the people wear. You will notice contrast in the quick restlessness of the city people since World War II who seem to belong to nothing at all, and the tradition-bound peasants of the little villages.

Japanese people love baseball and yet cherish sumo, an ancient form of ritualistic wrestling. You will notice contrast in the green and flowering islands and the neon-lighted capital of Tokyo. Soaring over Tokyo for an hour and a half before we could land, we saw the sacred Mount Fuji, through the clouds far distant, and below us the teeming city.

Rimming the bay were strange fishing boats, green hills bordered by clusters of tiny tile-topped houses huddling along winding, hilly roadways. Japan is ancient and modern, happy and sad. The drabness of the houses of Tokyo contrast with the lively silks of the ceremonial kimonos seen in the country areas.

I think of the complexity of Tokyo, largest city in the world, of the Ginza particularly, in contrast to the quiet rice paddies and lake areas. I contrast the crowded water fronts with the quiet little country villages shuttered and sleeping in the weeping rain. In Japan the very young and the very old are loved and cherished, another contrast.

The practical business men of Tokyo contrast with the starry-eyed in city and country who are lovers of cherry blossoms and of the waxing and waning moon, and of blue morning glories and flaming maples. Japan is a land of big business and of little home businesses. It is the most highly industrialized and westernized nation in Asia and stands as a symbol of progress.

TOPOGRAPHY AND CLIMATE
Japan is a very small country composed of 142,726 square miles and is slightly smaller than Montana, a State in the United States. It is made up of four large islands, Honshu, Kyushu, Hokkaido and Shikoku and 3,325 smaller islands and islets extending in a 1200 mile curve off the northeast coast of Asia. It has great variety in surface features because the earthquakes have constantly changed this land.

The islands are mountainous, volcanic, with very irregular coastlines. Fertile land is limited, so even much of the lower mountain area is farmed. As I traveled through the countryside, I thought that even the forests looked as if they had been raked and cultivated as every inch of good land is precious.

The rivers are short, falling steeply in many places, so there is much water power available for electricity. There are five hundred volcanoes, some still active. The sleeping volcano, Fujiyama, with its perfect cone, is the highest point in these rocky islands, reaching 12,395 feet. It is sacred and famous the world over. Tourists search for it to photograph its beauty but find it cloud-enshrouded much of the time.

The climate of Japan is mild and temperate except on the northern island of Hokkaido, where the climate is much like the extreme northeastern part of the United States. Rainfall is heavy, the rainiest months being May and June. The climate is moderated by the warm Japanese current. The average yearly temperature is close to seventy-two degrees Fahrenheit with summer temperatures up to ninety degrees.

I found I could not stand to wear a plastic raincoat in the summer because of the heat.

BEAUTY OF THE ISLANDS
Because of the heavy rainfall, the islands are emerald green with luxuriant growth covering the slopes of the mountains. Beautiful evergreen trees are everywhere in the mountain country and even in the rice country there are little forested areas surrounding village shrines. The forest area is over half subtropical, a mixture of broadleaf evergreens and conifers. The temperate forests are largely oak, maple, and elm.

The forests provide charcoal, wood pulp, fruits, nuts, bamboo, and mushrooms. Flowering azalea, plum, cherry, and chrysanthemums are everywhere in their seasons, making this lovely country a flower garden. Japanese gardens are famous for their pools with lotus blossoms and water lilies and huge gold fish.

Some of the gardens are famous for the miniature trees and plants, dwarfed by a special process known by these expert, painstaking gardeners. June 1970

Birds are numerous and varied in Japan, some of the well-known ones being herons, hawks, nightingales, sparrows, cuckoos. Songbirds are enjoyed and protected.

Only the brown bear, wild boar, and a few poisonous snakes are harmful animals found in Japan. Nara is famous for the many tame deer that wander around in the park area near the shrines and delight the tourists and children. Few places are far from the sea in Japan and few are far from mountains. This makes for magnificent scenery and for pleasant activities, mountain climbing and fishing and sailing. There are some beautiful lakes in the mountain areas and many resort hotels in the scenic parts of the country.

THE PEOPLE

Japan has over 100 million people and is therefore the seventh most populous nation in the world with only a rank of fiftieth in area. Sixty-five per cent of the people live in the cities. Seven cities in Japan have over a million population and Tokyo has more than ten million people. Osaka, the site of the International Exposition for 1970, is the leading commercial and industrial center. It has more than three million people. Kyoto is a beautiful green city with many unusual shrines and gardens. Block printing, jewelry carving, silk weaving plants are some of the artistic industries we visited. We saw workmen washing great strips of dyed silk in the canals.

Japan is the only Asian country with a great middle class. The family is the basic unit of Japanese society and parents exercise a good deal of control over the children. We visited a farmer's home in which a grandfather lived with the young couple and their three small children. The kitchen and storeroom were on a lower level than the bedroom and dining room and front room. There was a Shinto family altar and a Buddhist altar in both living room and kitchen. A cow was in a little shanty lean-to at the back. The people of Japan are almost one hundred per cent literate. They love their country, and I saw large groups of sight-seeing students in dark uniforms at almost every shrine. Japan publishes more books than any other Asian country, and Tokyo is the publishing center of the Orient. Through education people get ahead in Japan and a degree from Tokyo University almost insures a person a good marriage, still largely arranged by the families through go-betweens. It also insures a good position.

JAPANESE ARTS

Japanese art emphasizes nature and, even today, this has withstood pressures of modernization. I brought home some beautiful wood-block prints distinctly traditional in design. Pottery and china use the flower designs rather extensively. Noritake china is commonplace in the United States where the price is reasonable for a beauti-ful set of dishes. Japanese architecture reflects the traditional and is influencing architecture in the United States. There are many famous gardens, including the Katsura Imperial Villa, and the very sophisticated rock garden of Ryoanji Temple, both in Kyoto.

INDUSTRIES

The main industries of Japan are agriculture, fishing, manufacturing, and processing. The biggest handicap to industry is the lack of raw materials. Japan has sulfur, a little low-grade coal, and just a little oil. Almost all metals must be imported. Japan must trade or perish and she must manufacture and process to trade. Japan leads the world in the production of cameras, bicycles, motorcycles, transistorized radio and television receiving sets, and electronic microscopes and is doing very well in the automobile business as well.

GOVERNMENT

On May 3, 1947, the new postwar Constitution went into effect. It vests sovereignty in the people and makes the Diet (Congress) the highest institution of State power. There is a two-party congress. The Emperor is now the symbol of the State and the unity of the people. He only performs ceremonial functions. The Prime Minister and his Cabinet are the organs of real power. The courts are a separate entity. With these features, Japan is called a constitutional monarchy. Japan has forty-six Prefectures or States, each of which elects a governor. The cities also have their elective governments.

MEMORABLE SIGHTS

Many famous temples and shrines are scattered throughout Japan. There is a saying to the effect that if you have not seen Nikko you have not lived. This is an elaborate shrine set in a forest. I was intrigued with the many prayers tied on the branches of the trees leading to the shrine placed there by those who desired special blessings. It is at this shrine that you find the famous monkeys engraved with the idea: see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.

A sukiyaki dinner in a large restaurant in Tokyo was a notable experience. The waitresses who prepared the food as we all knelt or sat on pillows about low tables, then sang and played quaint instruments and childish games.

RELIGION

Buddhism, Shintoism, and Confucianism, are three important Oriental religions of Japan. The usual faith is a combination of Shinto and Buddhism. It has been estimated that there are thirty-eight million Shintoists, sixty-five million Buddhists, and only 850,000 Christians. Freedom of religion is guaranteed.

THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS

In 1901, three stalwart missionaries, Heber J. Grant, Horace S. Ensign, Louis A. Kelsch, as well as a young elder Alma O. Taylor, only eighteen years of age, sailed to Japan to open that far distant country to the preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ. President Grant spoke these prophetic words: "I have the assurance in my heart that there will be a great and important labor accomplished in that land (Japan). The inhabitants are a wonderful people." (Conference Report, October 1903.)

In addition to the four missionaries mentioned above, who at different times served as presidents of the Japanese mission, Elbert D. Thomas, H. Grant Ivins, Joseph H. Stimpson, Lloyd O. Ivie, and Hilton A. Robertson served as presidents. This was during the early period when translating was an important part of the work. Proselyting continued in Japan until the withdrawal of missionaries in 1924 due to the feelings of the Japanese toward the United States. The Japanese mission was reopened in Hawaii among the Japanese there, and the Church branches in Japan were directed from that island. This was considered the second period of the mission.

After World War II began the third period of missionary work in Japan, starting in 1948 and continuing to the present. This period was begun under the leadership of President Edward L. Clissold. Many of the Occupational Forces were Latter-day Saints, and they assisted greatly in a spiritual as well as a financial way. Elder Matthew Cowley was the first General Authority to visit Japan after the War. He arrived in 1949. There were 2,200 people attending the meetings held by twenty-seven missionaries. Other General Authorities who have visited and encouraged the people in Japan have been Elder Harold B.

Lee in 1954, who was instrumental in having the work begun in Korea and the Philippines; President Joseph Fielding Smith, who divided the mission into two missions: the Southern Far East Mission and the Northern Far East Mission, in 1955. Elder Marion D. Hanks and Elder Gordon B. Hinckley were in charge of the Asian area and gave much spiritual uplift and direction. The Northern Mission was divided in 1968 by Elder Ezra Taft Benson and Elder Bruce R. McConkie, both newly assigned to preside over the Asian branches. The division brought about the Japan Mission with President Walter R. Bills in charge, and the Japan-Okinawa Mission with Edward Y. Okazaki as president. He was the second Asian to preside. President Okazaki opened new headquarters at Osaka. He will head the missionary efforts of the Church at Expo 1970 under Elder Bernard P. Brockbank, Assistant to the Council of the Twelve. The Mormon Pavilion at Expo 1970 was dedicated March 13, 1970. Participating and directing the services were Elder Ezra Taft Benson, Elder Gordon B. Hinckley, Elder Bernard P. Brockbank. Elder Hugh B. Brown offered the dedicatory prayer. On Sunday, March 15th, Tokyo Stake with Kenji Tanaka as president was organized. The name of the Japan-Okinawa Mission has been changed to the Japan Central Mission with President Edward Okazaki still in charge. On March 22, 1970 Russel N. Horiuchi was appointed president of the newly organized Japan East Mission and Kan Watanabe was appointed president of the new Japan West Mission.

In 1904 a translation of The Book of Mormon into the Japanese language was commenced by Elder Alma O. Taylor, assisted by Elder Frederick A. Caine, several of the Japanese saints and two Japanese college professors. In 1909 five thousand copies of this translation issued from the press in Tokyo. In 1957 Tatsui Sato made a revision of the earlier translation of The Book of Mormon, and in that same year he translated the Doctrine and Covenants, Pearl of Great Price, and other works for the Church.

The Relief Society Magazine Fulfills Its Purposes Irene W. Buehner, Member, General Board of Relief Society Six stakes prepared beautiful displays for the Magazine department of the Annual General Relief Society Conference, October 1969. The various purposes for which The Relief Society Magazine was published provided the theme for each stake to develop as it chose. Sisters from many parts of the world admired the displays, and Magazine representatives, particularly, gained renewed enthusiasm to encourage the reading of The Relief Society Magazine.

"PROMOTES THE WORK OF RELIEF SOCIETY" Oquirrh East Stake Evalyn O. Olsen, A Stake Relief Society President TREASURE Connie K. Johns, Higga Seek Ii6 Stake Magazine Representative TRANSPARENCIES BY J M. HESLOP Lovely white handmade lace draped over blue silk, covered the table. An antique trunk with raised lid revealed the "Treasures of The Relief Society Magazine." From the interior of the trunk sparkling jewels and rich velvet fabric spilled onto the table depicting the "treasures." Gold foil discs placed on the table held open Magazines which indicated how the many programs of Relief Society are effectively promoted by the Magazine.

"EDUCATES, DEVELOPS, BENEFITS LATTER-DAY SAINT WOMEN" Bonneville Stake Elisa R. Wirthlin, Stake Relief Society President Isabelle Peterson, Stake Magazine Representative Three large blue frames edged with gold stood on the table which was attractively covered with a tailored blue cloth. The beautifully découpaged pictures within the frames were taken from Relief Society Magazines to portray the theme assigned. The "Editorials," "Spiritual Messages," and "Homemaking" all were designed to educate, develop, and benefit women.

"SERVES AS A HISTORY OF RELIEF SOCIETY" Provo Stake Grace S. C. Milner, Stake Relief Society President LaRue B. Davies, Stake Magazine Representative A large green burlap-covered disc provided an attractive background for the lovely quilted Relief Society emblem and other cleverly contrived colored felt pictures of historical interest. Gold doilies placed on the blue cloth-covered table framed the articles and pictures taken from The Relief Society Magazine which portrayed events from the pioneering and colonizing periods up to the present day. This display pointed out that each issue of The Relief Society Magazine is carefully and accurately preserving a choice historical heritage for future generations.

"ENCOURAGES CREATIVE WRITING" Wells Stake Pearl E. Lund, former Stake Relief Society President (now a member of the General Board of Relief Society) Gertrude S. Fullmer, Stake Magazine Representative The Wells Stake featured Alice Morrey Bailey as representative of the many writers who have been encouraged by having their prose and poetry printed in The Relief Society Magazine. Alice Morrey Bailey is an artist in many fields of endeavor. She designed and assisted in the preparation of this display. An elegant burgundy velvet cloth covered the table. An enlarged Relief Society Magazine in a gold frame was placed on an easel behind the table, and the center of interest was the thirty-one bound volumes of the Magazine marked to indicate the issues which contained the published work of Alice Morrey Bailey.

"THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE IS READ AROUND THE WORLD" University West Stake Annie M. Ballantyne, Stake Relief Society President Margaret D. Scott, Stake Magazine Representative This display dramatically depicted the world-wide distribution and influence of The Relief Society Magazine. The University West Stake created a beautiful paper maché replica of a world globe. The round table was draped with an exquisite gold satin cloth. Miniature flags of various countries marked areas where the Magazine is being sent. Blue ribbons connected the map areas with the open Relief Society Magazines artistically arranged around the table. The Magazines featured an article or indicated a contributor from that particular part of the world.

"CONVEYS INTERESTS, OPINIONS, AND STANDARDS OF RELIEF SOCIETY" Mesa Stake Ada J. Jones, former Stake Relief Society President (now a member of the General Board of Relief Society) Ethelyn J. Madsen, Stake Magazine Representative A background of folding screens divided the table into sections, each section denoting a period of time.

Appropriate articles taken from The Relief Society Magazines from the various periods were displayed on the screens, and little dolls dressed in the costume of each particular time in history reflected the interests and standards of the sisters at that time. In the first section of the screen the 1915 copy of The Relief (continued on page 451) ee | Opinions Standards.., Lilies of the Garden and Field Leila Grace Bassford LILIES—what vistas of enchantment the word evokes. We conjure up in our mind's eye tall flowering spikes of trumpet-like blooms, or tiny groundhugging species that literally carpet their own particular spot of earth. But whatever the variety, it is always rewarding to have lilies in the garden. Known as the aristocrats of the garden, they lend distinction and beauty wherever they are placed, and their culture is surprisingly easy. For most varieties, given a minimum of tender loving care, a well-drained, partially shaded location, a bit of fertilizer, plus plenty of humus (half decomposed leaves are good for this purpose), and they will thrive and reward you with an abundance of extravagantly rich and fragrant bloom. VARIETIES Most of the better known garden lilies are hardy and multiply rapidly, and in a few seasons the lily culturist will 442 have extra bulbs and clumps of well-rooted plants to share with her fellow gardeners, which is half the fun of gardening. Two of the most popular tall garden species are the pure white Madonna Lily (Candidum) and the Regal Lily (Regale), white with lilac and brown shadings on the outside, and yellow shadings on the inside base. Both of these species adapt themselves well to garden conditions, and propagate readily. Day Lily (Hemerocallis) has long, sword-shaped leaves, and the multiple flowers, each lasting but a day, are borne on a tall leafless stalk. The older varieties shade from pale lemon to deep orange. The newer hybrids come in mahogany, rose, bronze, and red shades. These are a favorite with many gardeners, as they are exceptionally hardy, thrive almost anywhere, reproduce enthusiastically, and are a colorful and decorative addition to the midsummer garden. Even the dainty Lily of the Valley (Convallaria Mayalis), with its graceful spike of white bell-like blossoms, whose appearance of fragility belies its hardiness, has all the charm, in miniature, of its taller, more imposing sisters. WATER LILIES The Water Lily (Nymphaea) is probably the most versatile of all garden lilies. The varieties include both the hardy, and the tender or tropical, the latter having both day-flowering and night-flowering types. The hardy types range in color from pure white to deep vermilion, with all sorts of shadings in yellow, bronze, and copper. The color range of the tropicals is an infinitely varied palette of blues, violet and purple, pinks, deep rose, and dark red. Most growers like to have some of both varieties in their pools. But one must be careful not to crowd them. They need room. You have no pool, and yet you love water lilies? Sink a galvanized laundry tub into a sunny spot in your garden, fill a box or other suitable container with at least a cubic foot of good rich soil, and plenty of nutriments (water lilies are gross feeders), plant one root of your choice therein, and submerge the whole in your laundry tub with eight to sixteen inches of water above the crown of the root. And there you are. Or there your lily is, when it has absorbed the proper light and heat to bring it to perfect bloom. Lilies of the Garden and Field WILD LILIES Equally as lovely as their cultivated sisters are the "lilies of the field" that star nature's wilderness gardens. Almost as soon as the snow melts, we find the petite Glacier Lily (Erythronium), sometimes called Dog-Tooth Violet, although it is not a violet at all, but a lily, blooming in the canyons and higher elevations. Indeed, I have seen them in Glacier National Park before the snow melted, whole fields of them, "fluttering and dancing in the breeze" like Wordsworth's daffodils, their brilliant, nodding yellow heads with drooping brown stamens in delightful contrast to the fields of snow at the base of the cliffs. The Sego Lily, a member of the Mariposa Lily family (Calochortus), with its thick creamy white petals and heart of gold, blossoms in May in sunny, sandy locations. It is especially beloved by Utahns, and is their State flower. As the early Mormon pioneers in the Utah valleys discovered, it has an edible root, and they used it to supplement their meager diet before the development of their crops. Transparencies by the Author Cupboards and Cannisters Designs, Arrangements and Photographs by JoAnne Baker Food storage can be a problem in areas where houses are not built with cellars. Sister Baker solved this problem by building food storage cupboards in the bedrooms of her home. Built unobtrusively in a corner of the room, these cupboards are decorated to match the room and its occupant. The cost for building such a cupboard was less than fifteen dollars. These cupboards are six feet eight inches tall, thirty-two inches wide, and eighteen inches deep. Cans of storable foods can be decorated attractively to make storage areas more pleasant, and such cans are welcome and wise gifts. These cans are coated with white enamel over papier-mâché. The flowers are pasted on, and the can is glazed several times. An old trunk makes a useful storage place. This trunk was painted and decorated. The decorative flowers on the outside were cut from the chintz material which was used to line the inside. Several coats of glaze were applied to the outside of the trunk. ¥ a TRANSPARENCY BY DOROTHY J. ROBERTS Beauty In Jeweled Fruit Peggy Tangren and Toy Stoddart Jeweled fruit knows no season. It can be used effectively with Easter decorations, at birthday parties, in wedding arrangements, and it does great things for the harvest theme at Thanksgiving time. It fits in perfectly with the lights and decorations of Christmas. But, best of all, it is a lovely and always ready table centerpiece for the occasional dinner party. Its brilliant beauty makes it worthy of the most elegant surroundings, and it becomes a conversation piece in any home. Jeweled fruit lends itself to a variety of arrangements. Make a jeweled fruit design on your mantel. For this no container is needed. When a gilded basket is filled with this fruit it adds immediate interest in an entrance hall. Arranged on a cake plate, as shown here, it is a sparkling centerpiece for a dining-room table. If a lower centerpiece is desired, an arrangement on a table mirror adds reflected beauty. In a low bowl-shaped compote, or on a large plate, the fruit is ideal for living room tables. A thousand starry lights shimmer when the fruit is placed under a lamp. One of the appealing aspects of this fruit is its fragile and delicate appearance, yet in reality it is firm and durable.

Breinholt, Chairman, Department of Art Brigham Young University For use with Cultural Refinement Lesson 4—"And to Every Man Is Given a Gift" (D&C 46:11) Northern Hemisphere: Fourth Meeting, February 1971 Southern Hemisphere: Fourth Meeting, June 1971 Each one comes to his own particular gift in his own way. Sometimes through early recognition and subsequent training one may develop such a gift to a point of excellence. Dale Fletcher was one who discovered his own gift at an early age and consequently its cultivation became a natural part of his training. Just as many families customarily enjoy activities with their children, so did the Fletchers. They went painting and sketching into the meadows, barnyards, and countryside. The children, armed with pencils, crayons, and paper, were motivated by their parents to look closely and record their impressions. By so doing they saw more and, seeing more, they developed a profound gratitude for the simplest forms of God's creation. The painting "Temple Site" was a direct result of a desire by Dale Fletcher to paint something for the first Festival of Mormon Art at Brigham Young University, in 1968. When Mr. Fletcher learned that the new Provo Temple was to be built across the street from his home, it became a sacred spot to him. Relative to his experience he said: "I waited for a day and a half out there, looking for the temple through an empty picture frame without ever touching my large white canvas. Silly, sitting among sego lilies, waiting for angels to come and pose. Faithless and impatient, I gave up and tried to paint what I saw and failed—light descending from heaven, cleaving the mountains, hallowing, redeeming grass, baptizing unto newness of leaf, working atonement, eter- marriage, achieving godhood, with all the angels hymning in the wild wheat." Though the artist in his own eyes may have felt that he failed, to the viewer, his painting says that the very physical light is divine. From the sky God blessed all living entities with his sunshine. Each blade of grass, one by one, declares faith in the validity of individual things and conjointly displays wealth of value in the common field. To "see" not just with the eyes but with the whole mind awake is truly a great gift. 450 THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE FULFILLS ITS PURPOSES (continued from page 439) Society Magazine was shown and the little doll standing on the table was dressed in the accepted style of a pre-World War I woman.

Sister Chadwick lives alone and cares for her home and yard. Her neighbors often receive a loaf of bread she has made. For over sixty years she has served as a visiting teacher. Her cheerful, optimistic, and industrious nature has endured for ninety-three years and endears her to her ten children, twenty-five grandchildren, and forty-two great-grandchildren. Her philosophy has been it's not how long we live, but how, and her life has been long in years and in service to others. Viva Irene Geisler Jensen, Farr West Stake, Ogden, Utah is best characterized as a homemaker. Her home has always been beautifully cared for, and her cooking is excellent. She makes her own drapes, helps with painting and wallpapering. Through the years she has made clothing for her family, and supplied Relief Society bazaars with beautifully constructed items. Her quilts are her most outstanding craft. She has made hundreds of quilts of all sizes. Each of her five children and nineteen grandchildren has his own personalized quilt made especially for him. She has won many fair ribbons. In addition to her handicraft talents, she plays the drums or piano for her husband's dance band. Sister Jensen has served in many executive positions in the auxiliaries of the Church. In Relief Society she has served in the presidency and as organist.

(D&C 104:17.) Celestia J. Taylor Northern Hemisphere: Second Meeting, September 1970 Southern Hemisphere: February 1971 OBJECTIVE: To point out that a storage plan can be started regardless of space or circumstances.

INTRODUCTION

Food?" These are but two of the There are those among our many questions which arise relative to the problem of where to Latter-day Saint membership store our provisions. Yet there are many who are meeting these challenges and proving the truth with the problem of finding suitable place to store these provisions. The question is asked, "How can We, who are living in small houses on limited budgets, meet this counsel?" or "Not having a basement, how can we find a place to store more than is needed for our weekly supply of food?"

462

HOW SHALL WE UTILIZE OUR AVAILABLE SPACE?

1. Storing Food in a Basement.

A basement room that is dry all seasons of the year, free from steam, hot air and water pipes, or heat of any kind, and one which is closed off from the rest of the house is an ideal storage room. Under these conditions the average yearly temperature will be between 50 to 60 degrees F., the temperature at which most foods will retain their maximum keeping qualities.

Not too many of us have such ideal conditions as these, to be sure. One family of six had as their entire storage space a basement closet and a small fruit room, and yet they succeeded in storing their one-year's supply which they kept in constant rotation. On shelves in the closet they stored dried beans, peas, rice, macaroni products, dried milk, and staples such as spices, flavorings, soaps, etc., in inexpensive tin canisters, gallon ice-cream cartons, and any cans with tight lids. On shelves in the fruit room, which they had provided with a good circulation of air by cutting a hole in the wall near the floor and covering it with an open grill to keep out bugs and mice, and a similar one near the ceiling, they kept home bottled fruits and vegetables, pickles, jams, and jellies. Under the shelves they stored case-lot purchases of canned meats, fish, milk, vegetables, fruit, shortening, flour, cereal, and sugar. They put slots of wood between the cement floor and the stored foods to keep any moisture away from them.

Sacks of flour were alternated with sacks of sugar, spaced so as not to touch each other to prevent infestation of weevil. In the fall they purchased three sacks of potatoes, two sacks of onions (one of small size for cooking whole, and one of large size for slicing, etc.) which they suspended in their mesh bags on a nail or stood on slats of wood on the fruit room floor.

Lesson Department

They stored a bushel of carrots, washed and topped, in a loosely-capped creamery can which worked as the hydrator in a refrigerator. (Parsnips and turnips in smaller quantities were stored in the same way.)

Several bushels of apples were stored in their garage and insulation was provided by encasing the boxes with crumpled newspapers and covering with old blankets to prevent freezing.

The motto of this family is: "It can be done, and it's lots of fun!"

2. Storing Food in a Small Apartment.

Can this be done? One young couple was able to store more than a one-year's supply by utilizing an outside wall and corners of the room, away from water or heating pipes, to stack cases of food. An attractive curtain with a drawstring hid it from view. Additional space was found on kitchen and closet shelves and even in bookcases where the food containers were camouflaged as objects of art.

Impracticable? They didn't think so. One of their safeguards was continual rotation and replacement.

3. Storing Food in a Garage.

When the garage or other buildings apart from the house are used for food storage, care should be taken to protect the food from extremes of weather, either hot or cold. Circulation of air should be permitted around any stored items of food to prevent sweating or moisture damage to containers or cartons. Food containers should be placed on wood slats so that they will not be in contact with cement floors or walls.

Spaces near open water, water pipes, steam outlets from any mechanical equipment, or areas where there are leaking roof or walls should be avoided. The walls of storage areas, particularly in buildings apart from the house, should be as airtight as possible in order to resist weather and insects.

4. Storing Food Underground.

Vegetable cellars are ideal for such foods as potatoes, apples, onions, carrots, cabbages, etc. If the temperature is cool and if they are kept off the dirt floor. Where shelving space is available, cased or canned goods may be stored if tightly sealed against moisture contact. Under such conditions vacuum-sealed metal cans, commercially packed, will give 463 June 1970 adequate protection to food for several years.

CONCLUSION

None of us should be discouraged in our efforts to work out a home storage plan to fit our own needs and conditions. As it is with anything we attain to in this life—if we really want to achieve it, we will work toward our goal and reach it.

The axiom stated by Henry Ford is applicable here: "If you think you can or you think you can't, you're right." SPIRITUAL LIVING The Pearl of Great Price Preview of Lessons for 1970-71 Through a study of the Pearl of Great Price, the women of Relief Society will have an opportunity during the next three years to learn new truths, receive verification of truths known in other scriptures, and gain an increased testimony of the mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith. The objective of this course of study is expressed in these words: To motivate each Latter-day Saint woman to fulfill her exalted role in God's plan of salvation through an increased testimony of the gospel principles revealed in the Pearl of Great Price. The Lord has blessed members of his Church bounteously in bringing forth the Book of Mormon, in giving by direct revelation the Doctrine and Covenants, and finally, by adding to the already existing Bible, the small, yet important contributor of great truths—the Pearl of Great Price. This among the four standard works of the Church stands as a monument to truth that the patriarchs from Adam through Abraham and Moses received revelation from God. The apostate religious world has gone a long way in its denial of the historicity of these ancient prophets of God. A prominent scientific theory of man's origin has given impetus to the idea that man's religions are the product of his cultural rise from primitive man to the present. Latter-day prophets have attacked, with the earnestness of inspired conviction, this falsehood against a belief in a personal deity and revelation from him. Against the false teachings of the world, the Pearl of Great Price stands as a witness to the doctrine of revelation from God to his prophets. The Pearl of Great Price was first published as a mission pamphlet in Great Britain in 1851, and in 1880 it was received in general conference as scripture binding upon all members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Elder Franklin D. Richards, while an apostle and mission president in Great Britain, brought together the materials composing this book. The preface, written by Elder Richards, forms the basis for one lesson. The preface includes a prophecy made by Elder Richards that is in literal fulfillment. Fundamental doctrinal messages make up the remaining lessons. These lessons include the important doctrine of the premortality of man, animal, and plant, and the values derived from an understanding of this knowledge. Another lesson is concerned with the magnitude of God's creations and the lesson of orderliness which one may receive from it. A major contribution to our understanding of the justice of God is the fact that he gave the plan of salvation to Adam, the first man. In a world where, by and large, Satan has ascendancy over the children of men, it is necessary for Latter-day Saints to be fortified against his wiles; consequently, the works, designs, and enticements of the adversary of truth are given, with the ways provided whereby his efforts may be thwarted in one's life. Of all doctrines of the gospel, the most fundamental is the atonement of Jesus Christ. Basic to this act of mercy on the part of the Savior is a genuine belief in certain fundamental teachings concerning Adam and Eve. The Pearl of Great Price makes such an opportunity available. Finally, emphasis is given to one of the most important one-sentence truths ever revealed. In this lesson one learns how one may accept the atonement of Christ for his individual salvation. Inasmuch as one can read the entire Pearl of Great Price in less than two hours, it is recommended that every member of the Relief Society read it from cover to cover before the first lesson. One may read comments about a book of scripture, but when these comments are combined with a reading and studying of the book itself, the spirit of truth is felt more abundantly. The lessons for 1970-71 have been given the following titles and objectives: Lesson 1—The Origin of the Pearl of Great Price Reading assignment: The entire Pearl of Great Price Northern Hemisphere: First meeting, October 1970 Southern Hemisphere: First meeting, March 1971 Objective: To help the Latter-day Saint woman to obtain a stronger testimony of the Pearl of Great Price as scripture.

BESS. 466 VISITING TEACHER MESSAGES Truths to Live By (Correlated with the Family Home Evening Manual, 1970-71) Preview of Messages for 1970-71 "And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed." (Luke 2:1.) Rome—preeminent, victorious, a colossus!—her proud armies and navies patrolled the known world. All roads led to her magnificent capital. Her emperors were worshipped as gods. At the height of her power, in one of her distant, troubled provinces, Jesus Christ was born.

Unknown, unheralded in the splendid city of empire, he lived his short life, probably unheard of in the halls of that distant, earthly power. Today that Rome is only a memory. Her proud streets are fragmented. Her beautiful columns lie tumbled in her ancient forum. Her gods are historical oddities. But Jesus Christ, who was born and who lived in comparative obscurity, is the Savior of the world. Not all men realize this yet, but in all nations men pray in his name and praise him. A slim volume written by his worshipping disciples bursts with the power, glory, humility, and love of his earthly ministry. This year we turn to its pages to replenish the fires of our own faith.

Social Relations Living Morally in a Changing World Preview of Lessons for 1970-71 The Relief Society, organized in 1842 by the Prophet Joseph Smith, has maintained the high purposes originally set forth. Efforts have been continuous and diligent "to raise human life to its highest level." This noble purpose is a particularly difficult achievement in the world of 1970 because of the very extensive impact of Satan. The foundations of the home and of society at moments seem to teeter on the brink of disruption, and any organization which is committed to perpetuation of the home and the enhancement of the individual has a most difficult assignment.

The Latter-day Saint woman is standing in the forefront of the battle against Satan with his subtle and his open ways of trying to defeat God's purposes. The woman's function as a homemaker is expanded to include her ability to understand herself as an individual and as a woman, to transmit to her children healthy attitudes, and, by her behavior, to set an exemplary pattern for her children to follow.

The lessons for the next year are aimed at providing guidelines and helps to the Latter-day Saint woman as she confronts life with a set of idealistic goals that are being challenged from every side. The role she must play in the world of the 1970s is a vital role for herself and for others. She must know herself and how she can meet life with all its temptations and frustrations.

470

She must also know how to teach, to guide, and to provide spiritual guidelines for others and, particularly, her own family. The appropriate and effective blending of the temporal and spiritual dimensions of life is a challenging goal. To help the Latter-day Saint woman acquire additional ability to respond maturely to today's challenges is the goal of the lessons for the coming year.

*CULTURAL REFINEMENT

Ideals of Womanhood in Relation to Home and the Family
Preview of Lessons for 1970-71
Textbook: Out of the Best Books, volumes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, by Bruce B. Clark and Robert K. Thomas

When the present cultural refinement program was first developed seven years ago, it was planned to be a six-year program using a series of books on literature to be written by Bruce B. Clark and Robert K. Thomas and correlated with music and the fine arts. That program has now functioned for the past six years, using volumes 1 to 5 of Out of the Best Books. It has been decided that the lessons this year (1970-71) will continue to be based on the materials already available in the five volumes of Out of the Best Books.

In the hundreds of letters received from Relief Society sisters commenting on the Out of the Best Books series, the principal criticism has been that in each lesson there was so much material that it could not all be covered in one lesson period; hence the class leaders and members were concerned in trying to cover much or in trying to decide what to teach and what to omit. A great deal of material was placed in each lesson for two reasons: first, to provide a variety of readings so that each class leader could find some selections particularly appropriate to the sisters in her group, and second, to furnish a rich offering of selections that Relief Society women might take into their homes for stimulating, enriching reading within the family.

Even though both of these purposes are very sound, we realize that it may have created a problem for cultural refinement leaders. It has been decided, therefore, that for 1970-71, approaches somewhat different from those used for lessons during the past six years will be employed. There will be seven new lessons and not just duplicates of lessons already studied. Each lesson will refer to a number of selections spread throughout the five volumes so that the class leader will have an opportunity to choose certain selections which may have been passed over in her Relief Society group or which she may want to reemphasize for the particular needs of the group.

In each lesson the focus will again be upon the enrichment of Latter-day Saint women's lives through the cultural arts, in harmony with the ideals of the gospel. In addition to presenting lessons as stimulating and valuable as possible for the Relief Society sisters, class leaders should particularly encourage all Relief Society members to share with their families the many excellent reading selections found in these volumes.

The outline of individual lessons for 1970-71 is as follows:

Lesson 1—A Family Reads and Sings Together
Northern Hemisphere: Fourth meeting, October 1970
Southern Hemisphere: Fourth meeting, March 1971
Objective: To present selections that enrich family discussions, provide wholesome entertainment and strengthen family relationships.

Major disaster struck and your family's food supply was contaminated? You were forced to leave home to face an unfriendly wilderness environment? SURVIVAL DEPENDS ON YOU there may be a time when you are forced to live off the land or die. Outdoor survival skills could mean the difference between life and death for the Latter-day Saint family. This book clearly outlines all the skills needed to survive in an unfamiliar natural environment. A veteran in desert and mountain-waste survival, the author, Larry Dean Olsen, has spent months at a time living off the land, his life depending on the strength of his hands and his technical skills. A national authority on survival, he now supervises a Survival-training program at BYU, leading groups on month-long ordeals in desolate areas.

480 Accomplish more Through Better Human Relations THE SPIRITUAL ROOTS OF HUMAN RELATIONS $4.95 by Stephen R. Covey

Here is a book fully in tune with the times by an author who is a popular lecturer and educator with the college youth of today. He examines problems in human relations from his vantage point as assistant to the president of Brigham Young University where he has daily contact with today's youth. He has found these "spiritual roots to be at the base of all human relations: vision — commitment — understanding and example — communication and self-discipline." This base is under attack on many levels of human relations; on campuses, in our national life, and throughout the world. Buy a copy of The Spiritual Roots of Human Relations and learn how these roots affect your success in your personal relationships and how these in turn may affect your overall accomplishments.

NOTE: All five volumes of "OUT OF THE BEST BOOKS" will be available from Deseret Book.

WATERCRESS SPRING '  
It is here: along the sluice of ditch And river touching cliff Where sun begins.... Here, springing on the blackest waters, Green unfolds across the silent cold There, after ice has thawed - And winter birds have fled the sky. The time of seasons turns And you and I, In glad remembering of summers past And all the bitter-fresh of taste, Return to gather memories And sheaves of watercress.  
And in the mirroring water When I watch the sky's reflection In your hair.  
The sundown crimson sunset Colors all the dusky trees. I see the winters of the future In the cliffs, and seize The moment of my spring And count it grace.  
There is but little time to love And gather home This earth Before we lose our summer place.

483 SO many Relief Society Councils with love. Thankfully they have our welfare at heart and can be obtained from the Relief Society Library, Annual to remember and respect. There Is an inspiration In asking me to prepare this article, Sister Marianne C. Sharp, Editor of The Magazine, wrote, "Relief Society sisters have expressed a need for counsel and direction regarding women's work in building the Kingdom. In the midst of the complexities and problems of our present earthly environment, some words of helpfulness from you would be greatly appreciated."

Recently, reference assignments, I was disquote from her; informative letter: In a recent Relief Society meeting we were discussing the lesson, "Work—A Road to Personal Fulfillment," and the subject began to elicit Some personal, 486 Women's Work The Kingdom We can be grateful that throughout the ages God has counseled his People and helped them to solve their problems, and his counsel is as applicable to successful homemaking as to other aspects of life. It is interesting to note that as God has admonished his people through his Prophets two words have frequently appeared—order and diligence. And order; for it is not requisite that than he has Strength.... It is In Building Elder Franklin D. Richards Assistant to the Council of the Twelve expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize; therefore, all things must be done in order." (Mosiah 4:27. Italics added.)

In connection with the matter we are discussing, the immediate prize is successful homemaking. In this dispensation through the Prophet Joseph Smith the Lord has told us that his house "is a house of order... and not a house of confusion." (D&C 132:8. Italics added.) Today things to do, so many crowding us. In this environment are key words to success an happiness regardless of the activity we are engaged in.

In meeting leaders, I frequently ask them what their greatest needs are. Almost invariably they reply that among their greatest needs is better organization of their time and work, or, in effect, more order and diligence. And it is not infrequent that the question, "Don't be too busy to meditate and when the answer comes have the courage to exercise prayer," say, "and To be most effective, meditation requires that time be regularly set aside to consider the things that seem to be required of you. Many times you find you have more to do than you can do in the time available. To develop an orderly pattern, consider the things facing you, analyze their importance and list them in the order of their importance. Give the things of prime importance first priority and develop a plan to accomplish them. Planning involves the development of effective ways which will save time and simplify the operation involved. Prayer is always advisable in planning the effective use of time.

My friend who wrote me regarding successful homemaking continued in her letter: Your success formula of "plan, simplify, and be strong" is very applicable. Plan: This does not entail long hours of paper work. It can be anything from a small notebook written in at night before bedtime to four mimeographed sheets with spaces to be filled in by each given hour. But it must 1, and it must have a place for short-term and long-term goals. Time average mothers have. Kitchen counter tops are often the worst "catch-alls." Remove everything but those items that are in use. Be strong: After you make your plan, and simplify your home surroundings, don't let important situations or interruptions prevent you from following your plan. I am not being rude to a friend when I can't talk on the phone now but will call her back later. However, it is wise to keep a plan flexible enough that should your husband, for example, call with an unexpected appointment to lunch or an afternoon at the beach elsewhere, you can accept it graciously and enjoy the time with him. A plan is not meant only for work schedules. Plan into day time for other things like dressmaking, cooking, and sports. Plan some physical activity, if only calisthenics. In the kingdom of God, when called upon to accept an assignment in the Church, which is an important part of our lives, we should select first things to do and work out a plan to accomplish them. By developing orderly habits, we make it possible properly to care for our families and have time to serve in building the kingdom of God.

107:99 He has counseled us to seek out of the best books words of wisdom and to seek learning even by study and faith. (D&C 88:118.) Study should be rated among those things of first importance. In organizing our time and work, time should be regularly allotted for personal study. In accepting opportunities to serve in the Church not only do we contribute to the welfare of others, but we set a proper example for our children which will be a powerful influence for good in their lives. By selecting first things to do and working out a plan to accomplish them, we have taken an important step toward accomplishing them. This is where diligence plays a big part. To be diligent in our work means to be effective and not just busy.

When the Lord counseled us to perform our assignments in all diligence, he meant whether it was convenient for us or not. To perform our assignments diligently, sacrifice of our time, talents, and means is frequently required but we know that sacrifice brings forth the blessings of heaven. We are thus entitled to the blessings which are predicated upon obedience to this principle of sacrifice.

Being diligent also requires faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and in ourselves, and making up our minds to be orderly and diligent is a good part of developing faith in ourselves. Even though our assignments seem difficult, as we develop our faith and persevere, we are able to achieve our righteous objectives.

Women's Work in Building the Kingdom President Heber J. Grant used to say frequently, "That which we persist in doing becomes easy to do, not that the nature of the thing has changed but that our power to do it has increased." To be diligent one must learn to persevere—yes, to endure to the end.

To the end of what? Can we endure to the end of a day with the same dedication and enthusiasm we had at the beginning of the day, even though faced with frustrations and problems. Each year has 365 days—a day twenty-four hours—each requiring enduring to the end. However, remember what King Benjamin said, "it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength." He undoubtedly meant mental, physical, financial, or spiritual strength, or all combined.

In all phases of my personal experience, I have found it wise to "survey large fields but to cultivate small ones." This involves the setting of goals—long-term and short-term goals. In surveying large fields, one in effect makes a master plan which he later develops in orderly stages. This is a sound way to proceed and avoid many disappointments which can result from over-extending oneself.

"Surveying large fields and cultivating small ones" involves the principles of order and diligence and results in growth and development. These are basic principles of eternal progression.

Again quoting from my Relief Society friend's letter: I have a daily and weekly schedule with goals—my goals for the next four weeks are:

First Week Plan extra time to prepare Relief Society lesson well. Read again from the story of the Prophet Joseph by his mother. Prepare for the nonmember fireside. Thank-you letters.

Second Week Plan to reread The Book of Mormon. Read twenty pages this week. Prepare to teach the Red Cross class. Bake bread—take some to Sister Hill and Mrs. Bright.

Third Week Read to page 45 in Book of Mormon. Send love package to Bill at BYU. Follow-up on families who attended nonmember fireside.

Fourth Week Make side drapes for master bedroom. Buttons—buttonholes on Mary's dress. Read to page 65 in Book of Mormon.

My Relief Society friend's suggestions are certainly in harmony with the eternal principles of order and diligence. As has been indicated, these traits can be developed and are key words to success and happiness regardless of the activity in which we are engaged. May we apply these eternal principles in our lives and make our homes truly a bit of heaven on earth and a stepping-stone to eternal life which is the most worthwhile prize of all.

On 490 + WE CROSSED THE RIVER (Crossing the Mississippi February 1970, in remembrance of the 1846 pioneer crossing from Nauvoo to Iowa.)

A triangle of winter birds fly low,
From the river's edge we watch their flight.
The river is frozen and covered with snow,
The Father of Waters flows deep below,
And we cross on the ice with cheeks aglow.

The cold, gray clouds keep the sun from our sight,
As the bevy of winter birds flies low.
From the river's edge we watch their flight.
The river is frozen and covered with snow,
And a rollicking crowd ventures out on the ice.
They race to the channel as stiff breezes blow;
Their gay sweaters sparkle in contrast to snow.
The Father of Waters flows deep below.
The sun peeps out and is gone in a trice.
The river is frozen and covered with snow,
But we walk for a mile on the blue-white ice.
We crossed the river on ice and snow.
From bank to bank we walked with delight.
The small children keeping their sleds in tow,
The Father of Waters flows deep below.

On the Iowa side our steps grew slow
As we started the trek to the Illinois site.
A triangle of winter birds flew low,
On the Mississippi we watched their flight.

—Sadie O. Clark

| THIRD NEPHI (17: 11-22)
"And it came to pass that he commanded
that their little children should be brought."
(3 Nephi 17:11.)
Bring them unto me, he said,
And they their little children brought,
Humbly sending them ahead
With blessing and thanksgiving fraught.
To him, who then commanded—
That the parents kneel;
And so they did—and then he knelt,
Having prayed unto the Father,
Radiant in the joy he felt.
So glorious were his words
That those unglorified
Can never comprehend
Nor indeed abide
Celestial utterance.

"Behold, my joy is full," he said,
His promised blessing drawing nigh,
So unto them his word he kept,
And then he wept—And so did I.

493 Contest Announcement of Winners
The General Board of Relief Society is pleased to announce the names of the winners in the second annual Relief Society Song Contest.
The first prize of $100 (sixty dollars for the music and forty dollars for the lyrics) is awarded to Audrey Dotson Beck and Helen Campbell Monson, both of the Denver South Stake Relief Society, for their lovely hymn entitled "The Song of the Righteous."
Sister Beck of Littleton, Colorado, wrote the music, and the lyrics were penned by Sister Monson, of Denver, Colorado.
The second prize of seventy-five dollars is awarded to Ruth B. Lehenbauer, of Dearborn, Michigan, for her hymn "I Seek Thy Peace."
Sister Lehenbauer was awarded second prize in last year's contest for "My Cup of Joy."

The prize-winning songs are programmed for performance by Singing Mothers choruses by the General Board of Relief Society.
The General Board is pleased with the response to the contest, although there were fewer entries than last year. Ninety-three songs were submitted, including four from outside the United States.
The committee of eminently qualified judges were impressed with the caliber of the songs.
The winners are to be congratulated for their very fine abilities, and appreciation is extended to all others who entered the contest.

Helen Campbell Monson
Ruth Benson Lehenbauer

Youth in Cedar City, Utah, where she attended the public schools and later the College of Southern Utah. Ruth Benson Lehenbauer was born in Washington D.C., a daughter of Serge and Elizabeth Benson. Her youth was spent in Maryland where she studied piano for ten years. She attended Utah State University and was graduated from Brigham Young

And then, nearing her sixty-first birthday, Aunt Lucinda had left them.
She had told Lila only yesterday that she was one of the most contented and grateful women in the whole world.
She had known romance even though her sweetheart had not returned from the war; she had reared four children who loved her;
and, until six months ago when she had had to retire because her knee hurt so much, she had been the finest principal in the district.
Even though the townspeople thought she was severe and unyielding in educational and civic affairs, they respected and admired her.

Aunt Lucinda had the McIntyre beauty. She was tall with dark hair and eyes to match and, Lila remembered tenderly, she also had a dignified mysterious charm about her.
Hadn't she kept the secret of Blueberry Hill all these years?
Lila felt a twinge of conscience at her eagerness to know what that secret was.

L. Ila opened the door and stood very still as she looked at Johnny.
He was the happy-go-lucky, debonair one of the family.
He isn't smiling now, she thought.
He looks like a little boy ready to cry for his mother.
Lila drew in her breath for courage, but the sweet curve of her young mouth trembled.

"Lila Bob!" he said, and the old familiar nickname for Lila Barbara was a heartthrob from her childhood.
"I didn't know she was sick. I still can't believe it. Why didn't you tell us? We would have been here!"

Lila leaned against the door frame.
She was so tired of answering this same question that had come over the telephone that morning from Elizabeth and Steven, and now Johnny.

"Why didn't you tell us, Lila Bob, so we could have seen her again?"

Tears of regret misted Johnny's blue eyes, those mischievous laughing blue eyes that had been the beacon light in Aunt Lucinda's life.
Just a note from Johnny or Elizabeth or Steven could make her whole day a shimmering rainbow.

"We'll make everything nice for each other," Aunt Lucinda had always told them.
"We'll work together to send Johnny to art school because he has such talent as a cartoonist. That boy! He can draw anything!"

And they all had, Lila remembered now as she looked at Johnny who was a cartoonist for a national syndicate.
Everything about Johnny McIntyre spelled success.
His carefully tailored gray suit, his blue striped tie, his reddish blond hair, a shade darker than her own, with a natural cowlick that brushed over his forehead—
Everything but the sideburns was familiar.

Aunt Lucinda wouldn't like those sideburns, Lila thought.
But she would melt with love for him as Lila was doing now.

"Oh, Johnny—Johnny," she murmured.
Then she was weeping against his shoulder and Johnny was soothing her.

"I know, Lila Bob. You will miss her more than any of us because you lived here with her."

I know how you feel." Lila did not answer, but to herself she asked: Do you Johnny? Do you know what it's like to find someone you love gone forever? To be all alone in a big old house with two floors and a tornado cellar? Lila heard the telephone ringing. She went to answer it.

"That was Elizabeth. She and Steven are at the airport. Will you go for them, Johnny?"

"Come with me," he coaxed. "The house can take care of itself. If anyone comes they can wait for us."

"But Johnny! That's not the way Aunt Lucinda would want us to do. She was so hospitable."

"I know," he admitted. "Funny thing! There was always something good in that old freezer in the cellar. She seemed to know when folks were coming or when a tornado would blow through Skylark. Even though it didn't ever hit our house, we had plenty to help others who were in its path."

"The neighbors will come," Lila added. "We should be home."

"Leave the door open," he argued. "Who will steal anything? This is Skylark—not Chicago."

Lila looked at him as she dried her eyes.

"We've had thieves in Skylark," she told him. "Things have changed here, too. Only last week Aunt Lucinda said we better lock our doors at night."

"No!" Johnny pulled a face. "Don't tell me people in Skylark have to lock their doors. I didn't know we even had a key to this old house."

"Two keys," Lila replied. "Aunt Lucinda had them made last week after we saw those strangers coming down from Blueberry Hill. But I'll go with you—it won't take long."

"Blueberry Hill," he repeated, after they were seated in the car and headed down the highway. "How I've wondered about Blueberry Hill! Why wouldn't Aunt Lucinda let any of us go up there, Lila Bob? Do you think there was something dangerous, like quicksand?"

"Oh, no, silly. Quicksand comes in swampy country."

"Not always," he said. "I saw a cowboy in a western picture who got in quicksand."

Lila shook her head. "I don't know. All of us were on our solemn honor never to go to the Hill. Even when she went to NEA conventions and I was here alone, I never went to the Hill. I just couldn't break my promise to her. The secret she had kept was very sacred to her, Johnny. It was more than just a place. It was sort of a—well—a pledge she had made to herself to keep us from some danger. Something she was determined to live up to."

"I know," he agreed. "I felt the same way. So did Steve and Elizabeth. We kept our promise to her. Remember the time I was down below in the hollow and I saw those strange men going up there? I ran to tell her and she sent me on an errand to the store. I stopped my bike on the highway and looked back. She was climbing up that hill with a determined stride. She had Grandfather's cane in her hand. I know her knee hurt her even then, but I don't think that was why she took the cane. I rode off to the store and when I came back, she was in the kitchen making my favorite chocolate-puff cookies. She put a quart of milk in front of me on the table and told me 'You can have it whenever you want; even if it's a bad time when he wanted.' Then I went upstate Blueberry Hill and she to College, I had to Work half the World. Wouldn't sell it."

"I would," She said. "We Would Have Playboy if I'g Had Worked a little harder. Hey, Lila Bob. It's Only a Spot On the Map but it Can Be Proud Pert. It is Modern in Every Way, even the Canopied entrance from the Bate to the House. Our old Home."

Aren't you forgetting the North River Country Club? Aunt Lucinda told me that Scott Harrington takes you there once in awhile." Lila bit her lip. Aunt Lucinda had thought she was foolish to accept Scott's invitations because he needed a partner for the Club parties. All the business people in town belonged to the Club and Scott Harrington was now president of the bank since his father's death a year ago. He hardly noticed the girls at the bank and only thought of her as little Lila McIntyre in the small loan department. She knew he didn't think of her as an attractive, grownup woman. She was part of the things he took for granted; the warm Skylark sun or the path he took through City Park on his way to the bank each morning after he left his apartment on Center Street where he lived in quiet contentment with his books and good music.

Aunt Lucinda must have known that Lila had admired Scott Harrington ever since he had gone to grade school with Steven and Elizabeth. She would laughingly scold Lila for always accepting his invitation when the occasion pleased him. She would say: "He needs a girl who will demand some sacrifice from him; not a sweet little angel like you who needs a man who can appreciate her Dresden-like beauty and take care of it."

Lila was never quite sure if Aunt Lucinda really disapproved but she went on accepting Scott's invitations, hoping he would really notice that she was grownup now and wore her clothes as well as any woman at the Club, and her reddish blond hair styled at Paula's.

"You need a change," Johnny said suddenly. "Come back to Kansas City with me. There is nothing to keep you here now."

Lila lifted her head, looking at her brother. What would happen if she went to Kansas City with Johnny? Would Scott Harrington wake up? Would he miss her when he needed a partner at the Club? Would he even notice that she had left town?

"All right, Johnny," she said over the lump in her throat, "I'll go back to Kansas City with you. Somehow I think Aunt Lucinda would want me to go for a change."

"Let's show you the town!" Johnny promised. "I'll make up for all those little dimes you sent to me when I was in art school."

Lila blinked her eyes to hide the tears. She was homesick already; and she hadn't even packed her suitcase. So much had to be done. There was Aunt Lucinda's funeral to be planned, the house to be sold, and there was Blueberry Hill. What would Aunt Lucinda want them to do with Blueberry Hill?

EDITORIAL / Two Who Care
"Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world." "Love one another; as I have loved you." "Pray for them which despitefully use you." "Go to the house of mourning." "Judge not, that ye be not judged." These and many other admonitory words of Holy Writ pertain to the calling of a visiting teacher. The attributes of loving, cherishing, and comforting permeate the visiting teacher's work. It is the very essence of charity—the motto of Relief Society. It is a privilege to be found worthy to be a visiting teacher and a blessed calling which requires personal preparation in the realms of spirituality, physical effort, intellectual activity, and charitableness. An opportunity is extended to two visiting teachers to enter about eight designated homes each month as emissaries of the Lord to the sisters in the home. Before beginning the calls it is well to go over in one's mind the conditions in each home which one may expect to find and resolve and plan with the companion visiting teacher the development of the message in a particular home, where this is felt to be desirable, and how one may make the sister in the home feel that she is cherished—that two visiting teachers do care. In one home may be found loneliness, in another heartache, or there may be sickness. A young mother may be overburdened, or sorrow may have entered a home. Moreover the needs may shift as the months go by. A fervent prayer by visiting teachers humbly offered in behalf of the great visiting teaching work to be accomplished.

Long afterward when I remembered Ronna's doll, it was as if I stood again beside my little sister gazing up at it, beautiful, new, beyond reach. My sister must have been four or five that summer, I two years older, and our playmate, Ronna, just between. Ronna was a chunky little girl full of giggles. We had a jolly time together, except when she was determined to dress and undress our darlings. Of course we wanted to share our dolls, we told each other. But how could we stand by and watch them suffer at her unskilled hands? "Ronna, don't be so rough with Crin and Toodles!" I told her one day. "Mama said they might come unjointed if you pull their arms way out like that!"

The corners of Ronna's mouth set firmly into her cheeks. "Not either rough!" she retorted. She pulled Toodles' arm from the shoulder socket until the elastic showed, then let it snap back into the pink sleeve. "You are, too!" I cried. "Let me take her." Ronna pulled away, clutching my doll. "Ill put her in the buggy," she said, but her brown eyes still snapped with indignation.

My sister had grabbed Crin and scuttled to the safety of the back porch. Crin and Toodles were fairly large dolls. They were well made, the shoulder and hip joints fitted firmly into sockets and were threaded with strong elastic, which was then tied in the middle of the bodies. The wigs were of real hair sewed to a cloth foundation and then glued to the heads. Long lashes enhanced the opening-and-closing eyes.

When Santa came, Toodles, a brunette, was dressed in pink Both had dainty lace-trimmed underwear. Economies went into their purchase price. When Ronna Came to play, She always told Mama how long she could Stay. Then Play with Crin announced one day Ronna's Doll "Don't make her cry," I said. "Mama doesn't like quarreling. And you know you don't have to go home yet." "Well, then, let me play with Toodles," 1 won't undress her. But What will I play with?" Smooth head.

July 1970

Sister offered. She rummaged in the buggy and handed me the large handkerchief. "Won't you let me play any more?" asked Ronna, her mouth drooping. "You can help wheel the buggy," I said. We started along the path, wheeling the dolls to sleep. After a few moments I said, "Ronna, why don't you bring your doll sometimes? You don't have to play with ours all the time." Ronna shook her head until her short dark hair flew about her face. "No! I don't want to!" she said.

My sister had reached the front gate and turned back. "Here comes Mama with the play dinner!" she cried.

Mama hurried across the yard, carrying a wide shallow pan. She whisked a white dish towel over the upturned wooden box and set the pan on it. "Well, now, I guess you girls can set your dishes around," she said. Then she went back to the house with her quick, light step, toward whatever task she had left unfinished. We lifted out a plate heaped with jelly sandwiches, whole slices cut into fourths, the syrup pitcher filled with cold milk, and the play dishes. "This is my favorite jelly," I said, taking a bite. "We helped Mama pick the wild currants." "Mine, too," said Ronna, licking the red sweet from a corner of her mouth. "Here come the birds!" I said. "Mama said to eat your crusts!" my sister reminded me. "I do, most of the time," I answered, tossing one to the hovering birds. 506 "Pour some milk into my cup," said my sister, holding it out. "You can drink one of these little cupfuls in one swallow," said Ronna, giggling. The birds cheeped and fluttered for tidbits, keeping their distance at the edge of the picnic place. We emptied and refilled the cups. The pile of sandwiches disappeared. When Mama came back for the pan and the dishes she said, "It's been an hour, Ronna. But do come again." Sometimes, as on that day, we walked part way with her, trundling the small-wheeled buggies over the dirt sidewalk. On the way we discussed our dolls' ailments, their colds and sore throats, their aches, and their occasional naughtiness. My sister and I didn't go to Ronna's to play very often. When we did, we stayed out in the back yard making mud pies, patting them flat with sticks, and leaving them in the sun to dry. A week or two later when we were there my sister said, "Ronna, haven't you got a doll?" "Sure I have!" said Ronna. "I got her for Christmas!" "Where is it? Can we see it?" I asked. "T'll ask my mother." Ronna hurried to the house. In a few minutes she opened the back door and beckoned. With careful feet we walked onto the shining floor of the clean kitchen. Her mother said some word of greeting and stood looking down at us, her hands folded. For the first time that day I was conscious of my tousled hair and my dusty shoes. Ronna said, "Come on into the bedroom." She led the way and pointed to a shelf. There was the doll, smiling out from the slim box edged with paper lace, her beauty shielded by a lid of transparent plastic. "Oh—it's—beautiful!" "It's—brand-new!" Ronna beamed. She stood on a stool and lifted the box down. Then she took the lid off and we gazed at the smooth, red-gold curls, the shimmering yellow silk dress, the white slippers and stockings. Ronna lifted the skirt, revealing filmy underwear. "Her eyes open and close, just like your dolls," she said. She tipped the box. Dark lashes curled softly on pink cheeks, like those of any fairy princess. "Real hair, too," Ronna said. "You can touch her, if you want to." Our fingers were strangely clumsy, fingering the curls, stroking the yellow silk. After a few minutes Ronna put the lid back on the box, climbed off the stool, and restored it to the shelf. "Come on," she said. We followed her to the back yard. "Ronna, don't you ever play with your doll?" I asked. "Oh, sure, I hold the box, like today," she answered. "But—don't you undress her?" I wanted to know. "Or feed her?" asked my sister, thinking, perhaps, of the many times milk had left a sticky trail down Crin's stomach. Ronna bent her head until her dark hair half hid her face. She poked one of the mud pies with the toe of her shoe. "No," she said slowly, "that would spoil her. My mother said so. I have to keep her in the box to keep her nice. Because she cost so much, I guess." "Your doll is sure pretty. Just like new," I said. "We have to go now. Goodbye, Ronna." All the way home our words exploded like popcorn. "Wouldn't it be awful to have a doll you couldn't even play with!" "Do you think it's jointed?" "It was still fastened in the box!" "It's sure pretty, though." "No prettier than Crin and Toodles when they were new." We hurried through the front hall to the bedroom and found our dolls still taking their naps. We snatched them from sleep with kisses. The aura of love that had veiled a dwindling of perfection was pierced by sudden awareness. We smoothed their dresses and combed their matted hair. We searched the bottoms of the buggies and the toy box for their shoes and stockings and bonnets. 507 July 1979 "Maybe Santa will bring new wigs for Christmas," I ventured. "Can stay an hour, " said my sister, by the time we had put Toodles in the buggy. "All right. If you won't play with her!" I had just turned reluctantly toward the toy box for something to wrap around Julia. Her cheeks, "She's only a play doll, Ronna! If you don't want to play with her! Go home then! "I can't play with my doll! And you know it! I think you're mean!" Ronna shouted from the kitchen. "See if Mama is making the jelly sandwiches," she said. By the time we got back, "Mama's making them. She said to take the buggies out under the tree and eat out there," my sister reported. We found that Ronna had gone home. But when Mama set the pan down there were three cups in it. "I brought the big cups today," Mama told us, smiling all around. "They don't spill as easily as the dolly cups. Now, set your picnic out." Then she hurried back to the house. We began eating in silence, glancing sideways at each other as we took small bites. "Your mother makes good sandwiches," said Ronna, at last. Jelly squirted at the corners of her mouth. "White mustache!" said Ronna, giggling. Somehow our angry feelings disappeared with the sweet jelly, the fresh bread, and cold milk. "Here come the birds," said my sister. "They can have my crusts," I said, tossing one recklessly. "Your hair won't be curly," said Ronna. "Won't be anyway," I agreed. Breezes shook the locust tree and a few pods fell on our heads. Giggles mingled with the chirps of the darting birds. When Mama came back to get the pan she said, "It's been an hour, Ronna. But do come again." A long sigh slipped from between Ronna's lips. "Oh, I will!" She promised. By the next summer, Ronna and her parents had moved away from our town.

With the beginning and ripenj after summer, Toodles and Crin and Julia and the Teddy bear, Christmas dolls for my own two little girls, one doll with braided hair and a red suit, the other with blonde curls, and wearing a blue formal. "They're lovely!" exclaimed my friend who was shopping with me. "But of course, you intend to keep them put up for awhile? Too expensive for regular play, aren't they?" It wasn't the had glanced at gloves. Suddenly, out of memory, I saw the beautiful untouched doll in its box on the shelf. I saw again the small face, wet with tears of rage, and heard a child's voice echoing, "I can't play with my doll! And you know it!" Again my cheeks burned. "I should have let her play with Toodles that day," I said first time she MY mended My friend stared. Me?" with the dolls. They're for!

A WOMAN'S TOUCH " There was land Dry. Barren, unappealing. Demanding. And taking the very lifeblood and soul Of those who dared to claim it. Then came a woman Whose heart cried out for beauty.

Then came beauty— The glory of God's creations Partnered with the woman's tender care and dreams and hopes 'a=. Blossomed as the rose.' —Theima A. Thacker MY Memory GARDEN Elaine J. Wilson Today I walked in my flower garden, admiring each lovely color and scent. But I wasn't thinking of the plants alone. I was thinking of people. Most of the plants in my garden are gifts or exchanges from others. I have some small, gray succulents that were given to me by a very wonderful friend. When she was ill I went to help her and, as she regained her strength we walked in her garden and she gave me slips and starts of flowers and succulents. Her friendship is a warm treasure in my life. So, as I look at the star-like succulents and think of her, my inner self glows with warmth, too. Not so with my double Shasta daisies! These come from a friend who fills me with envy because she is so talented. As I look at the stark white petals, I have to remind myself that I am getting close, too close, to envying her talents. What I must do is work harder to develop my own talents. There are the brilliant orange-red cannas with the deep plum-red foliage. These leaves make attractive floral arrangements, so neat and uncluttered. This is ironic because the woman who gave them to me is a poor housekeeper. But here, again, I must teach myself to be less critical, not to judge. Perhaps I would do no better if we exchanged places. As I look at my many Echeveria, I feel remorseful. How well I remember my young son rushing in to tell me that Mrs. Jones was giving us some hens and chickens. Without thinking, before he had a chance to say more, I snapped, "What will we do with chickens in a city!" After I had finished sputtering, he explained that they were hen and chicken plants. I had to apologize for my abruptness. Now, I have hen and chicks several places in my yard. When I look at them, I try to remember that I am inclined to jump to conclusions. I need to eliminate this factor from my life. I want to develop qualities of understanding and empathy. I think of the man who gave me several rhizomes of iris, saying, "These are the poor man's orchid." They are delicately beautiful despite their inexpensive cost. As it is in life, some of the more ordinary values are just as beautiful as those that seem more exotic. Old and tested friendships will, or should, mean more to us than knowing someone of notoriety, just because of who they are. I shall try to let my good friends and neighbors know that I love them and appreciate them and not just make a fuss over someone important. My garden brings much more into my life than bouquets of rainbow colors and perfume. It gives me a chance to evaluate myself and reflect on life's meaning, and to appreciate the goodness all around me. 511 Meatless Casseroles MARGARET'S RICE RING 3 c. Cooked rice, 1 c. Uncooked 4 c.

These are the 17: small crimson wild plums that grow along Potawatomies the ditch banks of the fields and — Mabel Luke Anderson and picking them is one of the delightful fall excursions we enjoy. After the first Indian summer days, when all nature is touched with golds and reds, the children start asking when we are going picking potawatomies (even the young ones on whose lips the big word is almost trapped). Last week we did go, but too soon. The plums need to be nipped with the frost to make them sweeter. It was not a trip in vain, though, for we saw the reapers getting in the last of the crops, and harvest fields awaiting the reapers, and heard the "fields of barley sigh like the sea and flow in gentle waves beneath the wind." On such occasions one can try to explain simply the age-old cycle of harvest from the plowing of the land to the gathering of the grains. Meadows were dappled with placid cattle and all contributed to serenity. Autumn has a gentleness all its own. This was one of the golden days, a lovely October day of leisurely mellow sunshine. As we wandered homeward laden with wild spoils of the harvest, the sun was sinking below clouds tinged with rose and violet, the haze was rising over the fields, the tang of frost was in the air, and the scent of smoldering leaves. We agreed that the charm of October was special. I think the impact of autumn color against the blue arch of the sky cannot be matched at any other time of the year. Walking in the crisp country air, in quiet lanes, is like a balm after fever. There was a lovely silence about everything, but if one looked closely and listened there were live things about. As we rustled through the carpet of fallen leaves, a tiny field mouse went scurrying, sparrows and starlings cried their objection to our sharing their feast. I remembered that poets tell of "birds singing from autumnal trees." We were lucky enough to see a squirrel fussily harvesting its winter's food. Gossamer threads clung to our faces and clothes. 514 Picking Potawatomies The afternoon was a blaze of color, the gray hills which form the backdrops to our valley were splashed with gold and green, russet and saffron. The fields were splendid from palest tans and yellows to rich brown. Even the weeds along the roadsides were colorful as if to atone for their useless life. On the plum trees, bright crimson fruit, touched with gold, was hanging among the foliage that the fingers of autumn were already painting yellow and bronze. As we walked among the trees, leaf after leaf lost its hold and fell slowly at our feet, unless occasionally whirled away by a playful breeze. Our baskets and buckets were soon filled to the brim with the tempting fruit. We knew why they were also called "squirt" plums. We could not resist one now and then and as we bit on the tough skin, the delectable juice squirted into our mouths. It was rewarding to put our hands up under the leaves and get several of the plump plums, offering a worthwhile vintage to a jellyintent housewife. I knew that soon they would be made into glowing jars of jams and jelly, with that tangy, tantalizing taste that only the wild fruits of the harvest produce. As we went home carrying the precious hoard, I recalled stories I had heard from pioneer lore of how abundantly the wild fruit provided special treats for the pioneers who had to live off the land. Autumn glory—surely each year as we leave it we may forget its loveliness, and must go through the same process of wonderment, days of warm, mellow sunshine, the rich coloring of hill and field and meadow, the misty haze and the gorgeous sunsets. One of the best days of my autumn is when we gather the wild plums.

YOU NEVER KNEW | KEPT ALL THESE

The heart-shaped rock we found beside the spring,
A feather from a blackbird's red-tipped wing.
This golden goblet of an April daffodil
You found, the day we climbed the topmost hill?
A daisy with its last love-petal clinging....
A seashell with the ocean's song still singing.
The time you whispered that we would never part—
Yet picked for me this small, red bleeding-heart...
This pine cone that you salvaged from the leaves—
You never knew that I would keep all these.

But such small treasures I have not kept in vain,
For I have all these memories. To relive again.

Mama Was a Heroine!

Maryhale Woolsey

@ That rain! Nobody in Willow Creek Valley would ever forget it. It was the talk for years to come; the old-timers declaring they had never seen its like in all their days; and the youngtimers declaring they hoped never to see its like in all theirs, again.

It began the second evening after Papa started out for Huntington, our nearest railroad station, with a double-bed wagonload of honey to ship East. We had watched him drive away into the very early morning with the sun not up yet and the air crisp, and the team acting even more skittish than usual.

"They'll quiet down after they've pulled this load a little while," Papa had said. "I? Ll have to rest them quite a lot. I hope you put up plenty of eats, Lib. 'll want to munch something every time I stop, most likely."

It was not a trip in vain, though, for Mama had been writing her list of things she hoped he could buy at the town stores. Things she couldn't often get at our country store, which was our post office, too.

"Don't worry," she told Papa. "You may think I'm asking you to buy the town out, when you start buying things."

Papa said, "Maybe I ought to give it a once-over right now...." He patted his shirt pocket where Mama had carefully pinned the folded-up shopping list.

"No, I'll manage. I'll probably just hand the list over to that nice clerk in the Biggs Department Store, and let her get the stuff ready for me. Especially the woman stuff."

Then Papa laughed, and Mama laughed, and Bill and Freddie and I laughed, too, because when both Mama and Papa laughed, nobody else could help laughing along with them.

This talk had been over the breakfast table. Mama had fixed breakfast while Papa was out doing early chores and hitching up the horses. It has been exciting to get up in the night and do breakfast-getting and eating by lamplight, and to watch Papa climb up to his high wagon seat and sit a moment or two with the reins held tight, just looking around at us all.

"You kids be good, now. See you mind Mama all the time."

The wagon made queer little groans as the horses started up, and in another minute they were all turning down the lane.

Passing the smaller gate in front of our house, Papa looked back and waved to us. We hurried to the porch, from where we could watch Papa cross the creek bridge and turn the corner a little farther on. He would be out-of sight then. Now we would go back to bed awhile, to make up our lost sleep. But I lingered a little longer, making believe I could see through the hill and think about Papa's long day and wonder. To me it seemed wonderful to think of city people far away—a thousand miles, maybe more—spreading biscuits or toast or even hotcakes with the luscious golden honey Papa's bees had gathered from alfalfa and clover fields through the long, hot summer days. And to remember Papa's saying to Mama how it meant a lot to us to get this load of early "prime" onto the eastern markets. He had practically smacked his lips as he said it—as if he himself might have been a city man getting a first taste of that sweet, golden, brand-new crop honey! 

Mama Was a Heroine!

The rainstorm blew in Tuesday night. The wind's noise awakened us, and the first thing we heard next morning was the patter of rain on our roof. That first day the rain was welcome. It had been many weeks since we had had any. We made rain hats out of folded newspapers, like the soldier hats we made in winter, to march around tables when we couldn't go outside. In the rain, now, we paraded up and down the walk from porch to gate, over and over, and even went out into the roadway where soft dust was becoming soft mud. When Mama called us in, we played games while she carefully unfolded our rainhats and spread the big sheets of paper over chairbacks to dry.

The second day of rain was less gay, and we were already tired of staying inside. But when, by late afternoon, the rain was still pouring and the sky's dark grayness not a bit lightened, Mama pinned oilcloth capes around Bill and me and told us to put our rubbers on and come out back and help her carry in more wood from the big pile Papa had been chopping and piling to last us while he was away.

After supper Mama read to us and tucked us all in, smiling and hugging us each in turn, but I didn't go to sleep for what seemed a long time. I saw Mama standing by the front windows, as if hoping Papa would come driving up the lane, when we all knew that Papa wouldn't be coming before Friday night, and it wouldn't even be Friday morning until tomorrow! That night the rain poured fastest and loudest yet, and when we got up next morning, our front and back yards were ponds of water.

Freddie saw the ponds first, and as if he didn't believe what he saw from the window, he ran and opened the front door. "Oooh, lookie, lookie!" he exclaimed. "It's a lake out there! Well... Almost a lake."

Bill and I scrambled over for a look. The front yard was all puddles, so wide and deep-looking that they did seem like one wide spread of water, dimpling and splashing a little as big raindrops fell into them.

Our woodpile was an island, a small hilly island standing up out of a yard full of that meanlooking, mud-colored water. Freddie, beside me in a moment, exclaimed, "Mama, is it going to come right in our kitchen? It's trying to come up our steps!"

"Do you think," I asked Mama, "it's raining like this all the way to Huntington and raining on Papa?" 

"T just wish I knew!" Mama said tightly. "I hope he didn't start back here yesterday afternoon... That road." Her shoulders gave a small shudder before she turned back toward the stove.

"Come on, boys. Breakfast will be ready before you can count a hundred."

We didn't try to argue; that fragrance could only mean cornmeal mush cooking, and we were hungry.

"I wish it would stop!" Bill exclaimed, pulling stockings on. "I'm tired of indoors play. It's no fun anymore."

But that morning Mama let us make honey candy, a big kettleful which we didn't finish pulling until past dinnertime. Dinner's lateness, however, didn't matter; we had sampled the cooking honey at every stage from no ball to soft ball and hard ball to the long-awaited crispy crackle, and we weren't hungry at all.

In the afternoon we heard a shout from out front. Our nearest neighbor was sitting at our gate on his brown horse looking very wet, with rain making rivers down his black rubber jacket and down the horse's ribs and rump. We all went out onto the porch to hear what he said to Mama.

"Thought I'd drop by and see if you're all right, Missus. Jack is away, isn't he?"

"Yes, he is, Mr. Babson. He expected to be home before tonight, but I don't know...."

"He may have some trouble, that hill road. You folks need anything?" 

"No, but thank you. I wish this rain would stop pouring down on us."

"TI amble along, then, and take a look at your bridge. The one up by Coles' place is gone. Coles came around collecting a crew to rebuild, rain or no rain. He's gone on to West's ranch, and I'm going by Scott's place to get a couple or so of his harvest hands and keep them out of mischief. Ill be coming back this way and I'll let you know what I see down there."

He rode on, and shortly came back again.

"Your bridge is all right so far, Ma'am. Can't tell though... I hope Jack makes it early, the creek may be rough tonight... So long, folks!"

That afternoon the frontyard lake—as Freddie insisted on our calling it—was lapping at the steps of the porch, and around the well's stone foundation. Mama put on her boots and rain cape and carried bucket after bucket of water. She filled all her big cooking kettles and the wash boiler and both washtubs.

"Isn't it ever going to stop raining? And why," demanded Bill, "do we have to have all this water inside our kitchen?"

"If the rain goes over the well's foundation the water will be too dirty to drink or to cook with. It would take several days for it to get clear again," Mama explained.

Freddie went to a front window and stood a long time looking out at the rain and chanting, "Rain, rain, go away... Come again another day—but not for a long time." His sober expressions made the rest of us laugh. We all began singing "Rain, rain, go away.. Don't come back for lots of days...." The singing made us feel better, and our supper of ham, potatoes and gravy, and canned peas, tasted very good, especially ending with chopped apples and cookies.

We had eaten early. Mama finished first, and got up and went to the windows again, looking out at the sky.

"Oh, I wish I knew where our Papa is!" she exclaimed suddenly. Later, when both Freddie and the baby were safely tucked in bed, Mama bent over Freddie and said, "Darling, Mama and Eddie and Bill have a job to do, and we have to leave you and Baby here awhile. Can you be a big man and wait quietly until Mama comes back? It's for Papa we have to do it," she added quickly, when Freddie's mouth opened and his smile changed to an unhappy look. "You'll help us do this for our Papa, won't you?" He nodded gravely and said, "Will Papa be home pretty soon?" "Soon—we hope," Mama said. "Goodnight, darling. Sleep tight." In the sitting room Bill and I were waiting, listening, and regarding each other intensely. We were bursting with curiosity, and at the same time feeling more than a little scared. I tried not to show it, but I felt it and was sure Bill did, too. When Mama came in, carefully closing the bedroom door except for a little crack, we sat up straighter, and Bill asked, "Mama, what are we going to do?" "Well... You heard Mr. Babson say that our creek might be pretty rough tonight? Well, if Papa comes along in the stormy dark, he might have trouble with the horses because the water might be a flood and frighten them." "The horses might run away and Papa might get hurt," Bill said as Mama paused. "That's right, Bill. We are going down to the creek and put a light near the bridge so Papa will know there's danger there. Then he'll stop the horses in time, and find out what to do." "But won't the rain make our light go out?" I asked. "Not Papa's new lantern," Mama said. "It has a storm shield. But look... It's starting to get dark, so we have to hurry. Eddie, find your overshoes and Bill's." With warm sweater jackets under our oilcloth capes, and Mama wearing her tall boots and carrying the lighted lantern while Bill and I each carried a coil of rope, we soon emerged into the gloomy twilight world of storm. The lane was all soft mud except where small rivers ran along the wheel ruts. About halfway Bill stumbled—a water-hidden stone turned beneath his foot, Mama thought it was. She let him hold the lantern while she tied rope around each of us, with spaces between, before going on. "This way," she said, "we can't get lost from each other." As we neared the creek, we could hear a roar of water. We stopped at the bridge and stared hard into the stream which seemed to reach high up its banks and had white edges that curled and twisted. Fear curled inside me; I had questions to ask, but was afraid my voice would shake and tell Mama and Bill what a scarecat I was. I saw Mama take hold of the bridge guide and step out onto the bridge, testing it. I had seen Papa do that once when we were having to ford a stream soon after a summer cloudburst. But Papa had used a pole. "It seems... Solid enough," Mama said. "Now, listen, I'll tie your end of the rope to that fence post back there, and this end of my rope around my own waist. It's a good long rope, it'll reach across—the bridge." "Mama! Do you have to go across the bridge?" Bill asked. "Of course. The lantern must be over there, because Papa must see it before he drives too near. But I'll be all right if you two helpers will remember what I tell you—and do it. If I yell, both of you pull hard on my rope. Hang onto it tight, and move back away from the bridge, because a yell would mean I've slipped off into the water, see? When I get across, though, I'll wave the lantern to tell you I'm all right. Do you understand everything?" We did, we assured her. She gave us each a quick kiss and stepped away onto the bridge. The water seemed to roar louder and louder. My heart seemed to stop beating every time the lantern bobbed the least bit, and coldness seemed to freeze me into an ice statue. At last the lantern moved high up and we knew Mama was safely on the other side. She moved on a little farther, and we could see, vaguely, the tree beside the road where she was hanging up the lantern, and tying it to a branch, and, at last, she was coming back towards us. It was Bill who thought about coiling the rope as she came nearer. It seemed to me that water was running, now, over the bridge itself. And, of course, now there was no lantern to watch, which would tell us Mama was safe. Then I saw that its little beam of light seemed to be following her. Faintly I could see the caped shape of her coming slowly nearer. What a joy, after that seemingly endless time, to have her back with us, safe and sound! We hugged and kissed her, not minding the least bit her wetness nor our own. Soon we were sloshing homeward again, and the sloshing had a glad, wonderful sound. Soon we could see a tiny square of light ahead, and knew it was the lamp in our front window, leading us through the deepening dark, our own lamp guiding us home. We had reached our gate when the sudden different sound reached us—a loud dull boom, and with it a crashing of wood. An ominous cruel sound among the slithering, splashy noise of the rain. Mama's hand caught, mixed with a queer moaning, "Oh—oh.. Like a long loud sigh." "It's gone," she said. "Oh, aren't we glad we went and put a light to warn our Papa!" Inside our house, all was quiet. And warm. We got out of our dripping rain wear and into night things and cuddly crocheted slippers. Mama surprised us with cups of hot chocolate. Then we knelt together and said "Amen" to Mama's prayer that our Father in heaven would watch over our Papa wherever he might be this stormy night. And then we went happily to bed. We were eating breakfast, next morning, when we heard shouting. First, quite near, the familiar "Halloo-o0-00-ooh!" that was neighbor Elmy's greeting, different from anyone else's we knew. And then, farther away—and down our lane—but indistinguishable as to words, our Papa's voice. We rushed to open the front door and out onto the porch, all of us together. Rain was still falling, but less of it, and the drops barely dimpled the front-yard lake. Our porch steps were above water, and the well's foundation showed plainly. Mama was a Heroine! These I noted in one swift look before my eyes found what they sought: Papa. Papa, riding Eagle, bareback, and leading Prince along behind. I never have been able to remember what words ran through the joyous bedlam that followed.

I do remember Mama asking, when Papa and Elmy had reached our gate together and stopped, "Where's the wagon?" in an alarmed tone, and Papa's reply, through a wide grin, "On the other side of the creek. The horses could wade, but the wagon has to wait till the water goes down some." After awhile, a sudden hush fell around us. Papa was asking— repeating something he had already asked but said again because Mama was stammering so. "I said, who hung my new lantern down in that tree last night?" Why—I did... I was bit by bit, we 'told Papa all about it, while Papa just sat and stared as if he couldn't believe it. It was Elmy who said at last, "You're a brave girl, Libbie. A brave girl if I ever saw one. What a woman! Jack, do you know how lucky you are, having a wife like her?" Mama's face was all pinky, and Papa's was even pinker. He said after a long silent time, "She'll do, I guess." I sat still, thinking the great thought—our Mama was a heroine, brave as any in a book! I looked out the window, amazed. The sun was shining! The bad storm was quitting, and Papa was safe at home again, and Mama—our own Mama—had become a hero-ine!

The Catch-All Drawer
Louise Wynn

One of the first things I remember about our old house is the catch-all drawer. It was unlike the other drawers in the kitchen. It didn't hold just silverware or just dish towels and pot holders. It held tinkertoys, pick-up sticks, marbles, jar lids, can openers, nails, screws, thumbtacks, paper clips, a monkey wrench, a hammer, a screwdriver, and anything and everything else for which we didn't have a special place. The catch-all drawer was a treasure box for a small child. We could find anything we wanted in it, and it always contained a few things we couldn't even identify. We never had to go all the way out to the garage to find the right nail for hanging up the picture we had just made in Primary. Mother could find the baby's lost diaper pin there. If we ran out of houses and hotels for the Monopoly game, we could be sure to find enough in the catch-all drawer. If we couldn't think of any games to play, Mother would get an empty spool, a piece of soap, and a rubber band from the drawer, along with a knife and toothpick to make a little wind-up machine that would roll wherever we pushed it.

When we moved into our new house I was about eight years old. I was helping Mother arrange things in the kitchen, and I noticed that one drawer was still empty. I said, "Oh, good, this one will be the catch-all drawer." Mother's quick answer was that we weren't going to have a catch-all drawer any more. "We're in a new house now, and we're going to do things differently. All those things we used to put in the catch-all drawer are going to be put where they belong."

We children found out soon that Mother had similar plans for all areas of our new life. We would no longer throw our schoolbooks and coats on the living room couch when we got home from school. No more dirty hand marks on sinks and towels. No more unmade beds in the morning, no more mud tracks in the house in the winter, and so on. She really did try to change us, but somehow we knew that none of us would change permanently just because of our new house. We were all the same no matter where we lived, and as the strange new house became our familiar home, even Mother would forget to enforce her new rules.

The drawer I had chosen to be the catch-all drawer became just that in a few months—it had become a habit and a necessity for us as had many other things. As we children grew up, we learned gradually to care for the household articles and we remembered to make our beds and do the dishes without being told, but we never stopped using the catch-all drawer.

Now I see in my own married life patterns developing and habits forming just as in my childhood family, and my explanation of this is simple. The catch-all drawer in the new house is my reminder that my future life depends on what I do now as much as what I am now is the result of my actions in the past.

WONDERING
Mother, when you were a girl,
When you were just my age,
Was electricity invented?
Were bustles all the rage?

Mother, when you were a girl
You had no TV set!
Tell me, then, did you and Daddy
Dance the minuet?

A Day At A Time
Mary Clough

Several years ago we planted some giant sunflower seeds. They grew taller and taller, and one day we noticed that the leaves turned with the sun during the day. We had always thought it was just the flowers that did so. Eventually the flowers unfolded and became larger than dinner plates and faithfully followed the sun's orbit each day.

One night about eleven o'clock we happened to turn a flashlight on one of the flowers. It had been facing west before dark, but now it had turned again and was facing east, waiting for the sun to come up in the morning. We flashed the light on the others and found they, too, were waiting with faces to the east.

We continued to observe them at night and found they were always turned expectantly to the east before midnight. In a few weeks, when they had fulfilled their purpose, they were too heavy with seeds to turn and follow the sun, so they remained motionless with heads bowed to the east.

I thought there must be some kind of lesson or inspirational thought to be gained from this, and so I wrote the following lines:

A DAY AT A TIME

Have you ever watched the sunflowers
That follow the path of the sun?
They slowly turn from east to west
Until the day is done.
In the darkness they turn east again
And before the midnight hour,
They're awaiting dawn's gentle fingers
To strengthen each golden flower.

When the dark of night overtakes you
And you find you are not through
With all the tasks that life requires
And you're tired and discouraged, too;
You also can look forward
To the first faint light of day
And ask the Lord to give you strength
As you kneel to him and pray;

Having faith that he will help you
In his wisdom, so sublime,
To overcome the trials of life
As you take a day at a time.

SAN FRANCISCO

The sea—the sky, in mist
The city floats,
Never static
Like the mountains
Are static.
Frozen waves
Are the mountains,
The sea and the city move.

Jerusha Spends the Night Hazel K. Todd Chapter 7 Conclusion @ Jerusha had insisted on Suzey's going with her girl friends to a special movie. Suzey had taken Amy's death very hard, she had had her care so much before Jerusha came. "It will be good for you," Jerusha said. She had finished the dishes and was just replacing the broom to the closet after sweeping the floor when she noticed Paul sitting by the window in the living room. He was holding Lynn's letter and gazing out the window in a preoccupied way. "He cares for her," she said to herself, "but he will never do anything about it." She thought a minute watching him from her distance. "Not with things the way they are now." She thought a minute longer, and then she patted her hair into place, took off her apron and folded it neatly on the kitchen table, straightened her shoulders and walked with quick steps over and sat down by him. He turned and smiled at her. "I've been thinking for awhile now," Jerusha began, "that it is about time I went home." He stared at her. "I was just going to spend the night, you remember." "But I thought this was going to be your home, Jerusha." "But I have a little house under a wild crab-apple tree in West Virginia." "We can't do without you. You belong to us!" "Now don't say anything outlandish like that," Jerusha quipped. "You know very well you got along before I came. Besides, you need a new start. That's what makes life get somewhere." He was silent a moment. "I should be getting used to losses," he said. "Now, don't go feeling sorry for yourself. You aren't that way, Paul Wilson!" "I'm sorry," he said apologetically. He looked at her lovingly. "It's just that we have come to love you so much—and depend on you. I know we can't be selfish." "Nonsense!" she ejaculated. "You know I've had the time of my life." She paused. "You know, I found the two most precious things of my life here. I can't wait to convert all my old friends!" she chuckled. "That'll be a good project. Besides," she added, "who said anything about divorcing myself from the Wilsons? I'll be back to pester you every once in awhile." "At least that will be something to look forward to," he said. She gazed at him tenderly. "I did keep my promise, you know. I stayed as long as Amy needed me." "Yes," he said, "I wish there were some way to show you how grateful I am." She looked down at the letter in his lap. "There is," she said and smiled at him through the corner of her eye. "Just don't let go of that letter. And read it once in awhile." She stood up and laid her hand devotedly on his shoulder. "Good night, son," she said. "I just took a job teaching Sunday School for as long as I'm here. I've got a lot of studying to do."

The next morning Paul was waiting for Jerusha in the kitchen before the family awoke. "I've been thinking," he said with his usual courtesy, "it would be best not to tell the children yet that you're leaving." "Of course," she said reassuringly, "I'm not going to run away tomorrow. I'll give you plenty of time to work things out." She added, "And since I don't have Behemoth to ride back in, I have to think about it awhile. Besides, winter is dull traveling with nothing to see but snow and naked trees. Maybe when the spring flowers start blooming, I'll just take a bus tour and end up at my little house." "Maybe you'll change your mind by then." She looked at him fondly but unrelentingly. "Please don't count on it," she said.

526 Christmas was coming, and Jerusha pitched into the preparations with so much enthusiasm that no one in the family could escape the contagion. The Christmases since Dorothy had been gone had not been such happy events as this. Paul had provided gifts for his children. They had put up a Christmas tree. Friends had brought gifts and invited them to dinner, but there had been no one to bake fruit cakes and fancy cookies, to produce trays of fudge and taffy and piles of caramel corn. There had not been holly wreaths on the doors and snowmen on the window panes, and a sprig of mistletoe tied with red ribbon from the light fixture in the living room.

"I must work extra hard," Jerusha told herself, "to make up for the absence of little Amy." She was arranging a nativity scene on top of the bookcase. She paused and looked at the Indian doll still standing on the shelf with its feather headdress and its fringed jacket. How little Amy would have loved to help her fix the Christmas things! She wiped her eyes with the corner of her apron and scolded herself.

"See here, Jerusha Appleby," she said, "you know very well little Amy is all night. Where is a better place for a child at Christmas than with her own mother? Fine example you are trying to promote happiness around here and blubbering yourself!" So she pinned a tiny bell on the brown fringe of the doll's jacket and hummed a bit of "Away in a Manger" they had sung last Sunday in Sunday School.

Joe and Suzey picked out the Christmas tree and brought it home, beaming with pride. It was a densely needled pine with a beautifully tapered top.

They stood it in front of the window and covered it with spangles of glory. "It's just right," Jerusha exclaimed to the pair. Joe's dark eyes flashed with pleasure. "We thought you would like it, Jerusha. It just seemed to match you." "Never knew I looked like a tree before," Jerusha laughed, "especially a fat one." That brought a snicker from Dennis, so they hung a few more tinsel bells just to show it didn't matter if she resembled a Christmas tree. Then it was the day before Christmas, and everyone was jittery with excitement. Along in the afternoon the door opened and Ruth Johnson and Lynn came in with their arms loaded with gaily wrapped packages. There were greetings and handshakes and everybody talking at once. "You've driven me beyond good sense," Paul declared as he came bringing a few more bright bundles out of hiding and stacked them under the tree on the already extravagant "So what!" Jerusha chuckled. "After all Christmas only comes once a year. Blame it on me. I've never had a family since I was a youngun." And she pulled him under the mistletoe, climbed up on a chair, and kissed him squarely on the forehead. Suzey had such a good time over it that Paul pulled her under the spot and planted a kiss on Jerusha's cheek. And then he grabbed Dennis snickering behind a chair. Dennis took the kiss on his nose as a matter of course, wiping the place with his sleeve. "Don't look at me," Joe ejaculated, gazing about the room as if he needed a place to escape. His eyes caught on Lynn standing under the Christmas tree. He snatched her by the hand and dragged her off guard. Under the magic sprig. "Next!" he said, a peculiar twist to his teasing smile. Jerusha's heart made a queer flip-flop. She waited breathlessly. Paul stood a minute tall and stately, his fine masculine face filled with some sort of strange conflict. He was looking intensely into Lynn's face, blushed pink with excitement. A wisp of brown hair fell over her face, and she brushed it away unconsciously. Then he took her in his arms and kissed her tenderly on the lips. Nobody said anything. They just stood there waiting until he held her from him, looking lovingly into her face as though no one else were there. "Lynn, darling, will you marry me?" he asked. Her eyes sparkled with happiness. "Of course I will, you big lovable lug!" she said, and he drew her head onto his shoulder. Joe broke the silence. He grinned sheepishly. "Here I just try to keep from getting kissed by a man, and I end up with a stepmother." "How about this gang, Lynn, can you take them?" Paul asked. "Never found one yet," she said with a wink at Dennis, "that I couldn't handle." Ruth was picking up her coat. "T have a lot of things to do, and I'm sure you don't want to go with me just now, Lynn," she said with mock sobriety. "Tl bring her back," Paul smiled. Ruth stopped at the door and turned, smiling. "Looks like I've lost my Christmas guest," she said, "unless we double up." "At our house!" Jerusha and Paul said almost together, and Jerusha added, "This calls for a real celebration." A few days after Christmas, Jerusha rode into town with Ruth to do some shopping. When she returned, she found Paul and Lynn waiting for her. "We want to talk to you," Paul said. Jerusha looked from one to the other shrewdly. "Been plotting something most unreasonable," she said slyly. "I can tell by the looks of you." "Not unreasonable," Lynn laughed. Then she arose from her chair and came to Jerusha and took her two wrinkled hands in her own. "Jerusha, were afraid you're going to leave because of us, and we don't want you to. We love you. We want you." "You belong to us, Jerusha," Paul said. A lump of gratitude and love arose in Jerusha's throat, but she swallowed it sternly, giving herself a mental poke. "Nonsense! I'm leaving because it's about time I took care of my own house. Probably has cobwebs hanging clear to the floor." "T told you it wouldn't do any good," Paul said to Lynn. "Can't we induce you to stay?" Lynn pleaded. "Nope." She unloaded her packages on the table. "When is this big event going to transpire?" she asked. "As soon as Lynn's school is out in the spring," Paul said. "Good!" Jerusha mused aloud. "Just about time for me to get things in order. And I think you'd better tell the family now." She chuckled. "They ought to be willing to trade an old wrinkled bag for a pretty young goblin hunter." "You're really hopeless!" Lynn laughed. "But, Jerusha, what are you going to do for a car?" Dennis asked when the aftermath of the news to the family subsided. "You don't have Behemoth any more." "Don't rightly know yet, Dennis," Jerusha said, "probably ride an excursion bus and have the time of my life with a new experience." The winter fled rapidly. Paul was as though he had taken a new lease on life. He whistled about his work, and no more did she find him silent and somber as he went about. Once she caught him with the Indian doll in his hands. He was standing looking at it thoughtfully. "Do you think Amy would ever have accepted it from Lynn?" he asked. "Why, of course she would," Jerusha said. "She just needed a little time." Paul took her hand as he had done that night when she had promised him not to leave Amy. They stood a moment facing each other, remembering, sharing the same poignant cadences of a sweet memory. Then she softly slipped her hand away, placed it fondly on his arm a minute, and then smiled and went on about her dusting. So spring came with its crocuses and its daffodils, its songbirds and its butterflies freeing themselves from their winter cocoons, spring with all its bursting new life. The time for other new beginnings was close. Jerusha had her things in order. The house had been cleaned from basement to attic, the clothes cleaned and pressed, patched, and buttons sewed on. "Don't want to leave any of my neglect around for a new bride," she said. Every time anyone went to town, they brought her back a packet of travel folders. She marked out a route here and a route there. "But I haven't found just the right one yet," she said. And then, one evening after she had noticed curious whisperings for two or three days among the four of them, they suddenly all burst in upon her at once. "There's something we want you to see," Paul said. And Suzey tied a blindfold over her eyes. "Land sakes alive!" Jerusha exclaimed, "I haven't played Blind Man's Bluff for more than fifty years!" They led her from the room and slipped the blindfold from her eyes.

"Surprise!" they sang in chorus as her eyes beheld the modest shiny new car. "Mercy!" she gasped, "not for me—not another Behemoth!" Jerusha Spends the Night

"Not Behemoth, Jerusha," Paul put his arm about her shoulders. "We named it New Start because of someone very near and dear to us who taught us all about new beginnings."

"And I'll bet it won't conk out like Behemoth did either," Dennis said, grinning at her.

"And it will take you on any route you want," Suzey smiled happily.

She turned to Joe with misty eyes. "And what could you say?" she asked of the jaunty young man whose hard-earned confidences she so cherished.

He dropped his eyes to the ground and scraped the toe of his shoe across the dirt. Then he looked into her face with frank admiration. "Just that I hope this car will bring you back."

"Every summer, I promise, for an anniversary visit in memory of the day Behemoth broke down." And then she went around the circle of her dear ones and kissed each one, and even Joe made no bones.

So the last few weeks marched away, and Lynn and Paul were married and returned from their wanderings. It was a bright summer morning in June. The rose garden was covered with glory. The bachelor's-button row along the fence was a maze of blue waving in the morning breeze. Jerusha was packed snugly in her new car among a pile of going-away presents from so many friends.

"It was such a nice overnight stay you invited me on, partner," she said to Dennis, standing long-faced with Skeeter and the others.

"What'd you have to go for?" he said soberly.

"Ah," she said with a sunny smile, "next time I break down in front of your gate, I'll probably be too old to go back."

Paul caught her words quickly. "There'll always be a welcome sign, Jerusha."

"Your room will be waiting," Lynn promised.

Jerusha gazed out over the familiar surroundings that had become so dear to her—to the willow tree with the bench where little Amy had rocked her doll, to the ridge where Dennis had gathered stink weeds, to the hen house where she had won Joe. Her eyes rested fondly on them a minute and then returned to her friends.

"Next time I break down," she said, "I'll just trade my little house under the apple tree for one at the end of the lane."

"We'll do just that!" Paul said, his face lighting.

So she rode away down the lane through the gate that had been left open for her. For a minute she looked at the sunflower patch at the side of the road where Behemoth had rested until the junk man was summoned to haul it away. She chuckled to herself softly, blinked a sudden tear from her eye, and sped away down the highway, the wheels in her head beginning to spin out the details of her new adventure.

Hemlock greens the streaming miles,
And fir communes with the gentle sky.
Gold, green, and fallow-brown lie
DEPARTED FROM DESERT

The checkered fields, quilting all distances.
The unwinking black eyes of berries
Dorothy J. Roberts Coax, by the roadside.

Frail mist weds the sun,
And the tossing sea talks in incessant liquid
Accent to the shore.
Beauty drops
Its easy mantle to all periphery
While I remember one white lily,
Determining, on the blistering hills of sand.

South Bear River Stake, Tremonton First Ward Relief Society Sisters Learn Candy-Dipping Skills
Homemade candy being boxed by Roberta Fronk and Iris Mortenson, chairman of the candy project. Lrene P. Kerr, President, South Bear River Stake Relief Society, reports: "The Tremonton First Ward of our stake has instituted a successful fund-raising project. Early in October, a special committee begins to shop for choice nuts, chocolate for dipping, and other ingredients which go into making candy. After the planning and shopping, the centers are made and stored to mellow.

"Shortly before Thanksgiving, all sisters who would like to participate are called to a two-day 'sweetmeet.' Here the work is carried out in assembly line fashion, with sisters molding centers, applying an extra bottom of coating, repairing rejects, placing the candy on trays. The sisters who are skilled in the art of dipping chocolates patiently teach anyone who wishes to learn. The candy is placed in one, two, and three-pound boxes and stored for holiday use. Over 300 pounds of candy were sold before Christmas. A special booth at the bazaar featured the candy.

Sister Hurst reports: "The presidency of the Spanish Branch Relief Society are dedicated in carrying out their responsibilities, although the branch is very widely scattered. During the canning season the sisters were taught to preserve fruits and vegetables. Sister Minjarez invited those who could come to her home to learn there. She and her counselors visited the homes of those who were unable to come, taking her own equipment.

"The Relief Society is making quilts, and the sisters are carrying a full Relief Society program, although visiting teaching is a challenge because of transportation problems. This branch has just completed its second assessment toward the Ogden Temple. Their projects have been making tamales, enchiladas, pillows, and other articles. We are very proud of their efforts and they are an inspiration to all of us."

Lesson 1 oan - - The Origin of the Pearl of Great Price Reading Assignment: The entire Pearl of Great Price

Northern Hemisphere: First Meeting, October 1970
Southern Hemisphere: First Meeting, March 1971
OBJECTIVE: To help the Latter-day Saint woman to obtain a stronger testimony of the Pearl of Great Price as scripture.

INTRODUCTION When The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized on April 6, 1830, two books of scripture were available for the instruction and guidance of the members of the Church. The first of these, the Holy Bible, accepted by Christendom as its guide to salvation, had, in 1820, inspired the boy Joseph Smith to seek guidance from God as to which of all the contending churches was God's Church. In March 1830, the second ancient scripture, the Book of Mormon, was published that modern man might learn that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the true way of salvation, and that disobedience to God's commandments will bring destruction to modern nations as it did to two great pre-Columbian civilizations upon the American Continent. By 1835, the revelations received by the Prophet Joseph Smith were available to the Church under the title the "Doctrine and Covenants of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints." Subsequent editions of this book of scripture contained additional revelations. By 1921 this book contained its present number of 136 sections. As the Doctrine and Covenants had developed through several 539 July 1970 editions by the addition and deletion of some materials, so also did the Pearl of Great Price, the fourth standard work of the Church. The Pearl of Great Price, printed first in Liverpool, England, in 1851, was published by Elder Franklin D. Richards, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles who was presiding over the British Mission. From 1878 to 1921 other editions were published in Salt Lake City. Many printings have been made since that date.

THE MODERN BEGINNING OF THE PEARL OF GREAT PRICE (Some of the following information was derived from the excellent book The Story of the Pearl of Great Price, written by Dr. James R. Clark, member of the Brigham Young University faculty.) From 1837, the time the gospel was introduced into Great Britain, until the first printing of the Pearl of Great Price, large numbers of people had accepted the gospel, many of whom had migrated to America. In fact, by 1850 over one-half of the membership of the Church, or about 31,000, resided in Great Britain, while 175,000 were in Utah Territory, and the rest were in other parts of the United States. Sensing the need to provide members of the Church in Great Britain, two-thirds of whom were converts to the Church of four years or less, with instructional materials, Elder Richards gathered from various Church publications the very important articles with which he made up the 1851 edition of the Pearl of Great Price.

CONTENTS OF THE FIRST EDITION Only three of the fifteen items in the first edition of the Pearl of Great Price had appeared in one of the standard works—in the 1835 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants had appeared sections 20, 27, and 107. Elder Richards apparently felt that these revelations on priesthood and Church government should be known to the saints in the British Mission through both the Pearl of Great Price and the Doctrine and Covenants. They were contained in the Pearl of Great Price until 1902, the fifth major edition of that book. The following Scriptures were first published in the first edition of the Pearl of Great Price: (1) the revision of Matthew 24, (2) Doctrine and Covenants, section 77, and (3) Doctrine and Covenants, section 87. The following items had appeared in other Church publications, beginning in 1832 until 1850, and are found in the present edition: (1) Writings of Joseph Smith, Part 2 (divided into two parts), (2) Book of Moses (in two parts in the first edition), (3) Book of Abraham, and (4) Articles of Faith. The poem, "Truth," known more familiarly as the hymn "Oh Say, What Is Truth?" was also included from 1850 to 1902. All the Doctrine and Covenants' revelations once in the Pearl of Great Price were deleted from the 1902 edition. One of these, Doctrine and Covenants section 132, appeared in the Pearl of Great Price in the 1878 edition.

CLASS DISCUSSION Wherein does the first edition (1851) of the Pearl of Great Price differ from the present (1921) edition?

CANONIZATION The canonization of the Pearl of Great Price as scripture for the Church as a whole was performed in the Fiftieth Semiannual General Conference of the Church held October 10, 1880. After President George Q. Cannon, counselor in the First Presidency, presented the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price to the conference, President Joseph F. Smith, the other counselor, said to the conference: "I move that we receive and accept the revelations contained in these books [Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price], as revelations from God to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and to all the world." ("Fiftieth Semi-annual Conference," Millennial Star, Vol. 42 [Nov. 15, 1880], p. 724.)

CLASS DISCUSSION Discuss why it was important for the membership of the Church to accept these two books as scripture: 1. As related to Latter-day Saint belief in continuous revelation 2. As being basic to the restoration of the Church

LESSON DEPARTMENT TRUTHS TO MAINTAIN AND DEFEND THE FAITH The ancient scriptures in the Pearl of Great Price are the Books of Moses and Abraham. The Book of Moses was received by revelation, using the Book of Genesis as the guideline. On this matter, President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., said: The Prophet Joseph Smith began a revelatory revision of the Bible, but it was not finished, for which reason the Church has never adopted it as a whole. The parts we accept will be found in the Pearl of Great Price in the Book of Moses and the revision of the twenty-third (last verse) and the twenty-fourth chapters of Matthew.

In June 1830, the Prophet Joseph recorded that the Lord "vouchsafed for us a supply of strength, and granted us 'line upon line of knowledge—here a little and there a little,' of which the following was a precious morsel," and then there followed the first chapter of the Book of Moses, which was not in the Book of Genesis. (Joseph Smith, History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, ed. B. H. Roberts [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1957], Vol. 1, pp. 98-101 [commonly called Documentary History of The Church; hereafter referred to as DHC].) It was while the Prophet, with the assistance of Sidney Rigdon, was "translating" or revising the Book of Genesis that the Lord revealed chapters 2 through 8 of the Book of Moses (chapters 6:45-68, and 7, being an "Extract from the Prophecy of Enoch"). The Book of Abraham, the second ancient scripture of the Pearl of Great Price, came to the Prophet in an unusual way. Four Egyptian mummies and two rolls of papyrus were sold to the saints in July 1835, by Michael H. Chandler. When the Prophet translated the hieroglyphics on the papyri, he discovered that they were the writings of Abraham and Joseph, who was sold into Egypt. (DHC, Vol. 2, pp.

235-36.) The Book of Abraham is the translation of the writings of Abraham. Having translated the plates of the Book of Mormon, written in reformed Egyptian, the Prophet was familiar with Egyptian hieroglyphics. On Monday, November 27, 1967, in a special ceremony at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art, eleven papyrus pieces once owned by the Prophet Joseph Smith were presented to President N. Eldon Tanner of the First Presidency. (Church News, December 2, 1967, p. 7; Improvement Era, January 1968, p. 12.) The appearance of this material 132 years after it came into the possession of the Prophet was acclaimed by Latter-day Saints as important evidence that the Prophet had Egyptian papyri which he translated as the Book of Abraham. The best information available to the Church for almost one hundred years was that the papyri and the mummies were destroyed in the Chicago fire of 1871. (Improvement Era, January 1968, p. 12.) The recovered papyri are only portions of the material possessed by the Prophet. The well-preserved Facsimile No. 1 of the Book of Abraham is part of the collection.

542 From these ancient scriptures precious truths only alluded to in the Bible are revealed in greater clarity while truths not mentioned in Holy Writ are made known. TRUTHS ALLUDED TO Important contributions elaborated upon in these ancient scriptures and mentioned in the Bible are: (1) the premortal existence of the spirits of men, (2) the antiquity of the gospel of Jesus Christ, (3) the creation of man and other forms of life, and (4) a miscellaneous number of truths. These subjects will form the basis of future lessons in this course.

To mention only a few truths not found in the Bible will be sufficient for the purpose of this lesson: (1) the temptation of Moses by Satan. (Moses 1:12-23.) (2) The name Jesus Christ and the expression "mine Only Begotten" (Moses 1:16-17; 4:28, 6:57) are not found in the Old Testament. In other words, the Old Testament, in its present form, does not identify the New Testament Savior Jesus Christ as God who gave revelation to the Old Testament prophets. (3) The vision of the beginning of the world to the end received by Enoch. (Moses 6:58-66; 7:1-69.)

There are many facts mentioned in the Pearl of Great Price which give greater understanding of the period of the patriarchs and of Moses than does the information in the Bible as it has come down to us. To mention only a few: (1) There were written records from the beginning. (Moses 6:5, 46.) (2) Adam and Eve had other sons and daughters besides Cain and Abel, which explains where Cain got his wife. (Compare Gen. 4:1-2, 16-17; with Moses 5:2-3, 16-17, 28.) (3) The earth as the mother of men is a living organism, yet inanimate to man. (Moses 7:48-49.) (4) A clarification of the expression "sons of God" as distinguished from "daughters of men." (Compare Gen. 6:1-2 with Moses 8:13-14.) (5) The Lord did not repent that he had made man, but Noah repented that God had created man. (Compare Gen. 6:6; Moses 8:25.)

There is a consistency and harmony of truth found in the modern standard works of the Church compared with the Bible which bear evidence to the fact that Joseph Smith was blessed with revelation from a divine source. In fact, the three modern books of scripture are witnesses to the validity of the Bible.

Class Discussion Name and discuss one of the teachings not in the Bible but revealed in the Pearl of Great Price that impresses you.

PREMORTAL EXISTENCE OF LIVING CREATURES Put yourself in the place of the nonmember acquainted with the teachings of the Bible and think how you would like to know the full meaning of such passages as the following: Then the word of the Lord came unto me, Saying, Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations. (Jer. 1:4-5.)

Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessings in heavenly places in Christ: According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world. (Eph. 1:3-4.)

Where wast thou when I laid the foundations Of the earth? Declare, if thou hast understanding. When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? (Job 38:4, 7.)

The fact that men and other forms of life existed before this life is clearly indicated in the Pearl of Great Price. (Moses 3:4-5; Abr. 3:22-28.)

THE ANTIQUITY OF THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST The idea that the gospel of Jesus Christ was known from the days of Adam to the days of Christ is not a part of the common "Christian" creed. New Testament writers, however, indicate that baptism and salvation through Christ were known to Old Testament prophets. (Gal. 3:8, 16, 17, 19, 24-26; [1 Cor. 10:2.) These truths were known to the patriarchs and to Moses. (Moses 5:9-12, 58-59; 6:58-66.)

THE DIVINE MISSION OF JOSEPH SMITH Joseph Smith received the Lord's appointment as his Prophet to open the last dispensation of the gospel. (D&C 1:17.) By revelation Moses knew that there would be one who would be like him in the last days to restore religious truths. And in a day when the children of men shall esteem my words as naught and take many of them from the book which thou shalt write, behold, I will raise up another like unto thee; and they shall be had again among the children of men—among as many as shall believe. (Moses 1:41.)

That the Bible would be changed and many important truths lost to the world was also known to Nephi centuries before Jesus' birth. (1 Ne. 13:23-29; 21:1.) The function of a prophet is to receive the word of the Lord and to make it known to the people that they may be led in paths of righteousness. When inspired by the Holy Ghost a prophet's words become scripture. (D&C 68:2-4.)

When one considers that Joseph Smith was the means of restoring the Book of Mormon, receiving the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price, the number of pages of inspired truth which were given us through him outranks those of any other prophet of record. It was foreordained that he should be the restorer of scripture and also reveal scripture for the salvation of men. (2 Ne. 3:6-11, 14-15.)

Another function of a prophet is to testify to revelation received by other prophets, for by the Spirit he may know of the truth of former revelations. The Lord said that in a day when the "Christian" religious world would lose faith in the Bible as the word of God, when the Bible's authenticity would be attacked by those who should be its supporters, creating distrust in its message and even in the divinity of Jesus Christ, the Lord would vindicate his prophets of old through his modern Prophet. So he did through Joseph Smith.

Class Discussion Viewing the contents of the Pearl of Great Price as one of Joseph Smith's contributions, how does it attest to the mission of Joseph Smith as a prophet? A PROPHECY Elder Franklin D. Richards in his Preface to the first edition of the Pearl of Great Price (deleted in later editions) prophesied that the day would come when Joseph Smith would be known in the world as one of the greatest men who ever lived, and the day would come when the world would recognize him as a prophet of God. The Lord prepared the Prophet for his calling in the eternal worlds before this earth was created. It was known to Isaiah that there would be a "not learned" person who would receive an ancient book from the dust of the earth that would contain doctrine and increase faith in Jesus Christ. (Isa. 29:12, 24.) That book is the Book of Mormon. Furthermore, Nephi knew that Joseph Smith would be a great seer, even a choice seer, who in the last days would do the Lord's work and thus perform a work of salvation for men. (2 Ne. 3:6-15.) The impress of his work would be felt among all men, even to the extent that in the millennium the peoples of the earth would come to accept that work. (D&C 1:17-23; 84:96-102.) Millions had already heard his name, others have accepted him as a Prophet and have had the desire to let many others receive the same blessing. (D&C 103:5-7.) To him was given the promise that the "ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name," and that the priesthood would remain with him forever. (D&C 122:1, 9.) Except for Jesus Christ, no man who has ever lived has done as much for the salvation of men in this world as did the Prophet Joseph Smith. (D&C 135:3.) By the testimony of the Holy Ghost, President Joseph F. Smith said, and many others could say with him: Joseph Smith is a prophet of God—living, not dead; for his name will never perish. The angel that visited him and declared God's message unto him told him that his name should be held for good and evil throughout the world from the day it was spoken until this moment, and from now on until the winding-up scene, the name of Joseph Smith, the prophet of the nineteenth century, has been, is being, and will be heralded abroad to the nations of the earth, and will be held in honor or contempt by the people of the world. But the honor in which it is now held by a few will by and by be increased that his name shall be held in reverence and honor among the children of men as universally as the name of the Son of God is held today; for he did and is doing the work of the Master. (Joseph F. Smith, Gospel Doctrine [4th ed.; Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1919] p. 606.) Class Discussion Why do you believe that the prophecy concerning Joseph Smith will be fulfilled? VISITING TEACHER MESSAGES—Truths to Live By (Correlated with the Family Home Evening Manual, 1970-71) Message 1—Truth and Free Agency Northern Hemisphere: First Meeting, October 1970 Southern Hemisphere: First Meeting, March 1971 OBJECTIVE: Obedience to the Lord's principles will bring a divine fulfillment in an individual's life. He was free, incredibly and wonderfully free. Free to live his own life, be himself, and to find out his true identity. No restraints, no one to tell him what to do. He was his own boss. And dad had been very decent about giving him money. Oh, he was truly free. The big city, far from home, was exciting with its endless possibilities. Quickly he found many friends, his kind of people— young, adventuresome, always trying out new ideas, embracing first this one and then that. There was no limit to what they would not try. In this heady world of new values, he began to see how much his family missed by sticking to old-fashioned ideas of morality, such as the denial of free love. All the forbidden things that troubled them were not really bad. Just some old Puritan notions. Drinking was fun, drugs were fun, gambling was fun. It was true that his money seemed to be going fast, but he did not need to worry. It was one for all and all for one; everyone was his friend. It became a very pleasant life. One day, however, the money was gone. Economic want stalked, not only his life, but the area in which he lived. His friends suddenly were out when he called. Those who did take him in were starving as he was. He began to look around him at what "freedom" had brought to him and his friends. When the fun was over, there were the diseased whose lives would be forever marred by sickness. There were children unwanted and neglected. There were those prematurely old, their thinking evil, their lives full of poverty and neglect. Worse, they loved evil, exploiting and preying upon their fellowmen. Gradually he became aware that no one really cared about or for him. When he did find someone to love, affection lasted only briefly and then went out like a tiny flame in the wind. One day he could stand it no longer. He went into the countryside and hired out as a day laborer, but wages were low, and he was hungry all the time. He began to see that freedom was far different than he had imagined it to be. He had tried to find himself; instead, he had become lost. Today many prodigals are as beguiled by the philosophy and enticing face of evil as was the prodigal son of whom Jesus spoke. (Luke 15:11-32.) How are we helping our children and ourselves to avoid mistakes and "lost"? Years from which for some there will be no return? How are we aiding them to understand the way of truth and freedom? Jesus pointed the way, "If ye continue in my word. Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." (John 8:31-32.) Man is free to choose, but he must choose God's way or he will not find true freedom. The principles of righteousness are the same today as in the days of Jesus. Freedom is indeed wonderful. President David O. McKay said, Next to the bestowal of life itself, the right to direct that life is God's greatest gift to man. Free agency is the impelling source of the soul's progress. It is the purpose of the Lord that man become like Him. In order for man to achieve this it was necessary for the Creator first to make him free. ("Free Agency and Its Implications," Church Section, Deseret News, Salt Lake City, Utah, April 16, 1950, p. 4.) The Lord has said "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you." (Luke 11:9.) One must have the faith to act on this promise.

Often children and adults reject the way of the Lord because they do not see that the gospel principles were designed to help them in the real world. From the time the child is young we should take the time, the hours necessary, to listen to what is troubling him and help him to understand the application of these principles. We must constantly show an increase of love so that his trust in us grows. (D&C 121:43.) Through such trust we can lead him to understand why the Lord has set limits, why growth entails self-discipline and great effort, and how the Lord is fair, just, and reasonable in his counsel.

Lesson Department

By prayer, study, and righteous living we use our free agency according to God's plan. The "freedom" from responsibility sought by the prodigal son is enslavement. The freedom God intended for his sons' and daughters is light and truth, "for," as Paul says, "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death." (Rom. 8:2.)

HOMEMAKING—A Lovelier You

Discussion 1—You Owe It to Yourself to Become a Lovelier You

"Yea, man is the tabernacle of God, even temples!" (D&C 93:35.)

Northern Hemisphere: Second meeting, October 1970
Southern Hemisphere: Second meeting, March 1971

OBJECTIVE: To help each woman accept her responsibility in taking care of her outward appearance.

INTRODUCTION

To Latter-day Saints, temples are not only havens of spirituality, but supreme examples of all that is lovely and beautiful on this earth. Our bodies are often called "tabernacles of the spirit." "Yea, man is the tabernacle of God, even temples..." (D&C 93:35.) To think of our bodies as temples, therefore, commits us to the task of treating them as temples.

A beautiful woman is a woman who emulates her divinity and remembers that, as in our temples of God, cleanliness and modesty are first considerations. A woman who treats her body as a temple is grateful to her Father in heaven for the loveliness of her hair, her special coloring, her features, her skin, and her vitality.

Brigham Young admonished the women to make themselves beautiful. Let the sisters take care of themselves, and make themselves beautiful, and if any of you are so superstitious and ignorant as to say that this is pride, I [John A. Widtsoe] say it is not. Let the mothers set the example.

"If there lS anything virtuous, lovely, or praiseworthy, we seek after these things." (13th Article of Faith)

As mothers, we must ever keep more serious guidance and set a good example for our children. Is our own grooming as important to us as it is to them? Would you have your children practice in the food they eat? Then you, as the mother, must refrain from eating poorly dressed or unattractive clothes. "Am I dressing with the qualities of a mother's appearance in the home?" To be neat and clean at home for we do for our friends? 547

Discussion Question: When high standards of dress seem to crumble about us, do we maintain our level-headedness and use good judgment in our own choice of clothes?

Lesson Department

CONCLUSION

A woman is often judged by her appearance. First impressions are important. A woman needs to accept the responsibility of maintaining a pleasing outward appearance for herself as well as for others.

SOCIAL RELATIONS—Living Morally in a Changing World

Lesson 1—Morality and the Individual

Northern Hemisphere: Third Meeting, October 1970
Southern Hemisphere: Third Meeting, March 1971

OBJECTIVE: To show how an understanding of morality makes for an enlightened regard for the individual in our social relationships.

WHAT IS MORALITY?

Most of us think that morality is the same as chastity. With a little more thought, we might add the idea of honesty, obedience to law, or dealing justly. But important as these concepts are, they are not the whole of morality. Basically, morality is the love of what is right and good. We are moral to the extent that we show that love in our treatment of other people.

THE IMPORTANCE OF PEOPLE

A moral person has the proper regard for the individual. To be moral is to value human life. The scriptures teach that "the worth of souls is great in the sight of God." (D&C 18:10.) At the Creation, God had such high regard for man that he "crowned him with glory and honour" and gave him "dominion over the works" (Ps. 8:5-6) of his hands.

Christ's teachings are filled with examples of his regard for people of all ethnic and national origins, poor and rich people, sick people and well people. His regard for people is the essence of his gospel. Eternal life, "the greatest of all the gifts of God" (D&C 14:7), is the prize he would have all his children win.

Those winning this prize are to share with Christ all the Father has. Recent space explorations have excited the imagination of the world regarding man's accomplishments and possibilities. In the ways of the world, they tell us about the importance of man and represent a "giant leap" forward for the mind and spirit of mankind.

For example, man need not accept blindly and on faith that the earth is a special place of habitation. The moon walkers have made it clear that the earth is a diadem and with its spectrum of light and color a most inviting planet, especially when viewed by space travelers from the emptiness and blackness of space.

The moon may "rule the night" (Gen. 1:16), but man walked and lived on the moon for several hours only because the earth had equipped him to live there. The earth which was created with "plenty and to spare," provided the air, the water, and the food. The act of creation itself (recorded in the first chapter of Genesis), the world as it is being rediscovered from space, and the fact that God trusted man sufficiently to give him "dominion... over every living thing" and the responsibility to "replenish the earth" as he used its resources (Gen. 1:28) lend credence to the importance of man in the plan of God, and reaffirm what the faithful have always known about the worth and value of human personality.

Hopefully, such secular events as space exploration will help man to realize his genius and the importance God attaches to the work of man, the "pearl" of his creation.

Question for Discussion: Inasmuch as we believe in the importance and worth of people, why is it so difficult to accept them as they are?

INDIVIDUALITY

To value people truly and to hold them in esteem—to cherish them for what they are—it is necessary to recognize and accept differences as well as likenesses. It is sometimes more comfortable to work, play, and otherwise associate only with those who look, feel, think, and act as we do. We sometimes criticize, judge, find fault, and even condemn those who are different from ourselves. This is not moral conduct, for the Lord enjoins us to "judge not, that ye be not judged." (Matt. 7:1.) The Lord judges people according to their righteousness, not according to their superficial characteristics.

When the Prophet Samuel chose the boy David above his older brothers to be anointed king of Israel, the Lord said, "Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature... For the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart." (1 Sam. 16:7.) Only the Lord can look in a man's heart; only the Lord can judge him truly.

Therefore, we are warned, "I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men." (D&C 64:10.) The Lord may choose an individual or a people to help carry out his purposes in the earth, but all his countless and infinitely varied children are alike to him in their claim upon his love, "and he inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile." (2 Ne. 26:33.)

But God does not expect his children to be "alike" in the sense that they must all be the same. We should expect people to be different, if we accept the principle of free agency. Among the three and a half billion people living on earth today, no two are the same. Not even identical twins are identical. Each person has his own body structure, physiology, chemistry, and ways of behaving. Differences so vast that they almost defy description help to explain such everyday puzzles as why one child eats heartily and another picks at his food, or why members of the ward have such different ideas about the architecture for a new chapel.

To be specific, the nervous system, closely connected with personality, is subject to variations. Investigations, which admittedly are not complete, show that "warm spots," "cold spots," and "pain spots" on the skin are different for each individual. In a recent study, the distribution of pain spots for twenty-one healthy young adults was shown to have a high degree of variation. Under controlled test conditions the right hand of one young man A—tested in a particular area—was found to be "highly sensitive over a seven percent area, while a second person B showed 100 percent "highly sensitive" areas. On A's hand 49 percent of the area was free of pain. (Roger J. Williams, "The Biological Approach to the Study of Personality," Theories of Psychopathology, ed. Theodore Milton [Philadelphia: W. B. Saunders Co., 1967], pp. 23-24.)

This simple difference in sensitivity to pain may explain why some highly sensitive mothers overprotect their children, while others, less sensitive, may be indifferent to minor injuries to their children. Mothers may mistakenly believe that their children feel or fail to feel pain as they do.

Studies of personality yield even wider variations among individuals. No two people react to stress in the same manner. Some appear to thrive on daily crises, while others confronted with these same crises become ill. Differences within the same family are well known. One child accepts responsibility easily and anticipates new challenges with pleasure. Avoidance of responsibility may be the typical reaction of another child in the same family. Family home evenings can be a source of satisfaction to some families because of the enthusiasm and preparations of a particular child who loves this part of the Church program.

Question for Discussion: Why is an individual enhanced in your eyes by knowing some special quality about him—a talent, ability, skill, hope, ambition, or desire for his family or friends, for example?

Differences among people surely add to the interest, richness, beauty, and challenges of life. These differences can also pose very serious problems unless we learn to recognize and understand them. We need to accept differences and to affirm individuality.

Few disasters are more tragic than those that result when a parent has a preconceived notion of what his child 551 should be like. Dr. Konopka read the words of the Prophet Joseph Smith, uttered on the occasion of the organization of the Relief Society: "This is the beginning of better days to the poor and needy, who shall be made to rejoice and pour forth blessings on your heads." After reading these words and with the experience of an hour with President Spafford just ended, Dr. Konopka stated that, in her extensive travels in America and Europe as she has been engaged in humanitarian service, this was the first time she had ever seen relief and beauty combined.

In giving compassionate service, women of the Relief Society have an opportunity to "reap blessings" as they cause the poor and needy "to rejoice." Social relations are a science as well as an art, and can be greatly enhanced by a true consideration for every human being, regardless of age, physical condition, or educational status. For service to be compassionate, the particular needs, wants, and aspirations of those served must ever be uppermost in the minds and hearts of those who would be the dispensers of service.

An adult loses the respect of a child if he classifies that child along with other children. Neighbors, listening and hearing and being responsive to what they hear, promote neighborliness and improve the quality of life in the community. When the heavenly messengers appeared to Joseph Smith in the sacred grove, the name "Joseph" was spoken. God, the Father of us all, individualized the fourteen-year-old boy.

All men, women, and children like to be identified and mentioned by name whenever possible, regardless of their church affiliation, ethnic origin, or their economic level in society. They are responsive to those who individualize them and accept them as they are. A non-judgmental, accepting approach eases tension, particularly in work with people who have failed, either in their own or others' expectations of themselves.

Criticizing these people for their failures by word or action only results in estrangement, closing the door to any further good work that might be accomplished. Criticism and censure create barriers to understanding and are likely to be autobiographical—revealing more about the critic than about his intended victim.

The psychological illusion of righteousness, called self-righteousness, can be created by criticism, for in this way in our own eyes we appear to be better followers than unless their righteousness exceeded that of the Scribes and Pharisees they would "in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven." (Matt. 5:20.) Individualization, acceptance, and a non-judgmental approach can do much to facilitate and guide in everyday relationships. Paul reminds us of the importance of charity, "which charity is love." (2 Ne. 26:30.) Question for Discussion In what way can compassionate service by members of the Relief Society be more fully realized by the concepts of individualization, acceptance, and a non-judgmental attitude? 

SUMMARY Morality is basically a warm regard for every human being. It delights in the miracle of creation and the infinite richness of society and people in all walks of life. The moral life truly makes sense to all people whose concern is to serve their fellowmen.

CULTURAL REFINEMENT Ideals of Womanhood in Relation to Home and the Family Lesson 1—A Family Reads and Sings Together Textbook: Out of the Best Books, volumes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 By Bruce B.

Payne—Bishop As indicated earlier in the preview of lessons for 1970-71, the lessons during the coming year will draw upon selections and discussions already printed in the five volumes of Out of the Best Books published during the past six years. It is felt that there are so many excellent selections in these books—far too many to have been fully covered by any Relief Society group—that another year of stimulating lessons might be developed using the books already in the hands of the Relief Society sisters. New approaches will, of course, be employed in reexamining these and joy unit.

Lesson Department Many families have never discovered the rewards and joy that come from reading together frequently—little children caught July 1970 Books volumes is suitable for family reading and discussion.

Note: Comments and discussions of the above selections will be found in the text.

Other selections in the five volumes are also valuable for family reading, especially to focus upon special problems or needs. For example, if a family has teen-age drivers who are not driving as carefully as they should, an unforgettable lesson in highway carefulness will result from reading together Karl Shapiro's powerful little poem "Auto Wreck" at the end of volume one. However, the stories and poems in the two lists above seem especially appropriate for almost all family groups.

Most children are responsive at much younger ages than adults may realize. Children love literature, both the fascination of stories and the enchantment of the rhythms, rhymes, and imagery of poetry. Few things that a parent can do for a child will be more valuable throughout his life than helping him develop and maintain a love for reading.

Beyond the selections in these five volumes, libraries offer other rewarding selections that are equally rewarding. Let us mention just a few books that families might share through hours of pleasant reading together.

First and foremost are the scriptures and the writings of our modern prophets, which we should all learn to love for the beauty and truths in them, and which should be part of the daily reading of all members of the Church. Then, there are classics such as the Iliad and the Odyssey, fascinating works from centuries ago. Many people are afraid to read them, fearing that they will be dull or remote or too difficult. They are quite the opposite; the very reason they are classics is that millions of readers, young and old, in many lands and languages, have been charmed by the excitement of the adventures they unfold.

Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn, a wonderful adventure story when we first read it as children, seems even better when we reread it as teenagers, and continues to grow greater and deeper, and more thought-provoking when we return to it as adults. Almost everything Mark Twain wrote is delightful for family reading, but Huckleberry Finn is his masterpiece.

Tom Sawyer is a wonderful children's book, but Huckleberry Finn is for readers of all ages. Or, if we want a shorter work that will capture the interest of the whole family, we can read together such a warm and emotionally appealing story as The Red Pony by John Steinbeck; or George Orwell's little novel Animal Farm, a brilliantly clever modern satire against communism; or Alan 558 Wheat Mills for Your Storage Program.

Paton's Cry the Beloved Country, a novel concerning modern South Africa, beautifully poetic with its emphasis on love as the solution to the complex problems of our modern world. If we are especially interested in teaching our children to love reading, we should be aware that they are perhaps not ready for the depths and heights and greatness of Shakespeare or Milton or Chaucer. Perhaps they are not ready for the rewarding complexities and difficulties of T. S. Eliot or Henry James or Joseph Conrad. But they can hardly resist the excitement of the novels of Charles Dickens or Robert Louis Stevenson or Sir Walter Scott, or the rhythmical delights of such poems as Browning's "Pied Piper of Hamelin" or Vachel Lindsay's "The Congo" or Edgar Allan Poe's "The Bells," and other poems.

Young readers are still charmed by Lewis Carroll's children's classics of a century ago, Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, which contain such enchanting poems as "Jabberwocky," or with such a modern children's favorite as the little novel Where the Red Fern Grows by Wilson Rawls. High school readers are challenged by the stirring biographical portraits in the late President Kennedy's Profiles in Courage.

Not all books are for all readers, but everyone should make reading a rich part of his life, and anyone who does will be forever richer in mind and spirit. Perhaps Emily Dickinson said it best in two of her poems:

There is no frigate like a book To take us lands away,
Lesson Department
Nor any coursers like a page Of prancing poetry.
This traverse may the poorest take Without oppress of toll;
How frugal is the chariot That bears A human soul!
(From volume 4, p. 11.)

He ate and drank the precious words, His spirit grew robust; He knew no more that he was poor, Nor that his frame was dust.
He danced along the dingy days, And this bequest of wings Was but a book. What liberty A loosened spirit brings!
(From volume 5, p. 70.)

Class Discussion: What specific benefits have you and your family enjoyed through reading experiences in the home? Are there values beyond those found in the reading itself?
