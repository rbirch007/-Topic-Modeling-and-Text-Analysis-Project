The members of the General Board have the joy of personally meeting with sisters in all stakes of the Church. While customs may vary and languages differ in countries, the spiritual understanding flows through material barriers, and fuses two Relief Society sisters into a bond of oneness, as they clasp hands and look into each other's eyes. Though this coming year may be filled with continuing tensions, unrest, and even violence, though men's hearts may fail them through "the distress of nations... The sea and the waves roaring," still all is in fulfillment of prophecy by which the saints are forewarned. Relief Society members know wherein their security lies. They have established their feet on the narrow path — the road of heavenly protection and safety. Serving others, even as they are beset by personal trials and temptations, yet they live in righteousness hedged by the wisdom of older times. Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; And lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, And he shall direct thy paths. Though man-made and heavenly tempests roar, Relief Society members walk in directed paths and steadfastly look to the time when "the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the seas." On behalf of the General Board we send love and greetings to our next-door neighbor Relief Society members, and to all members in the uttermost parts of the world; to the sister most recently voted into membership and to the one whose mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, and great-great-grandmother have accepted the joyful opportunity of membership, beginning with membership in Nauvoo the Beautiful. Once the obligations of membership are accepted, all become true sisters in the bonds of charity, with the same glorious heritage of love and service. May the security of peace in righteousness abide in the heart of every Relief Society member in 1963 and forever, is our prayer. Affectionately, may ot ae mn dies The article ''A Permanent Home," by Norma Dee Ryan (October 1962) expressed my feelings at the time. The flowers I worked on all spring were in bloom and the yard green and nice. Now, in our new home, and it is home already, we have planted two more trees that we will never see grow, and started watering the dead grass. The grass is starting to turn green, but we will not be here long, for my husband, too, is military, and we soon expect an overseas order. 'The Magazine will follow us there, and the Church will soon make it "home." —Mrs. Colleen A. Bentley K. Dgemont, California When my Magazine arrives I have to stop whatever I am doing and _ glance quickly through its pages to satisfy myself with reading the thoughts of other saints, and then carry on the rest of the day with a song in my heart, anticipating the pleasure I shall have later when the day is done and I can relax with my favorite Magazine, thankful for the pleasure and benefits I receive. —Mtrs. D. L. Ring Leederville, Perthshire Scotland I always read the "From Near and Far" page because I enjoy the things others think and say about our Magazine. I enjoy every issue. Sometimes I start right at the beginning and read everything except the continued story, which I save until the last of the month, so that I won't have to wait so long to see what happens next. Sometimes when I am blue, I read something that lifts my heart. Sometimes I find wonderful things to help me with my family of seven children. Sometimes when a problem rests heavily upon me, I find the perfect answer in the Magazine. No matter what the case, the answer seems to come from the Magazine. —Donna Abegglen ot. Anthony, Idaho I truly enjoy reading The Relief Society Magazine. It is a warm, spiritual visit from home. Two of our young missionaries out here came to see me one day and informed me that they had marked some articles in my Magazine that they wanted me to read. Upon opening the Magazine, I discovered that they had marked all the "articles" in the recipe section — candy, cookies, pie... Etc. I find that the 'Tecipes work just as well here as they did in Switzerland, France, or back in our own country. The elders in the mission here are many of them subscribers to the Magazine, and they tell me that they enjoy it very much. —Luella B. Hanson brussels, belgium I especially enjoyed the editorial "In the Family There Is Strength" (by Vesta P. Crawford) in the August issue of the Magazine. I felt the message so keenly, as we had just had a wonderful visit with my daughter and son-in-law and their six children from Washington, D. C. —Myrene Rich Brewer Ogden, Utah During the summer months I was so busy I only took time to scan through my Magazine. 'Suddenly I found myself im the hospital with a ruptured appendix. I had plenty of time to read all the back issues. For days the Magazine was the only reading material I could handle, because it was small and light. What an uplift I received from its pages, with such a variety of literature and beautiful pictures. Many times I read to the woman who shared the room with me. I hope " I was able to spread the gospel to her through this medium. 3 —Marjorie S. Patterson > s President _ Santa Ana Stake Relief Society Santa Ana, California *

Teach Virtue and Modesty President Joseph Fielding Smith Of the Council of the Twelve [Address Delivered at the Officers Meeting of the Relief Society Annual General Conference, October 3, 1962] sight to think that you good sisters have come from all parts of the world to attend this conference. I congratulate you for your faith and your integrity and | want to say to you, we pray for you constantly. You are doing a wonderful work, and the Prophet certainly was inspired by the spirit of the Lord to have such an organization as the Relief Society given to the Church. You have a great work to perform. We remember you in Our prayers, we want you to know that the work that you are performing is fully appreciated by the brethren of the Authorities of the Church. Now, I want to endorse all that has been said and done, and I am very grateful that Brother Petersen had the inspiration to speak as he did on a topic that is most timely. I know of nothing that is more important today than the theme which he presented to us. Now, there are a great many good, honest people in the world, but that does not change the fact that we are living in a wicked world, a fallen world. In fact, it has always been fallen since Adam and Eve were driven out of the garden of Eden. But that does not mean that there have not been good people down through the ages, at least most of the time. Your work is just as imures is certainly a wonderful 4 portant as any other work in the Church. I want you to know that your brethren appreciate it. I want to say a few words, too, along the line that was mentioned by Elder Petersen. Our day was seen in the days of Isaiah. The Lord opened the eyes of Isaiah. He saw the gathering of the Latter-day Saints to these valleys of the mountains and spoke about it and about the blessings of the Lord that would attend them. But he also saw in that great vision some of the pitfalls and the difficulties and the transgressions that would befall the Latter-day Saints, along with other people, and he has spoken of it. When Isaiah spoke of Zion, he did not mean the world, and when he spoke of the daughters of Zion, he meant the daughters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I am going to read you a few verses, "As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women tule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to ert, and destroy the way of thy paths. The Lord standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people. The Lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses" (Isaiah — 3:12-14). HEN he goes on to talk about Zion. Who is Zion? We, the Latter-day Saints. Moreover the Lord said: Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet: Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the Lord will discover their secret parts. In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon. The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers, The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings. 'The rings, and nose jewels.. (Isaiah 3:16-21). We haven't got quite to that point yet, have we? The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins, The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails. And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty (Isaiah 3:22-24). That is as far as I need to read. Now, you good mothers, you should teach your children virtue, chastity, and they should be taught from their early childhood. And they should be made aware of the pitfalls and the dangers that are so prevalent throughout the world. Now, we are living in a wicked day. When you read your newspapers you can discover that, and they give us but a small fraction of what goes on. Wickedness prevails. One of my good brethren who had the right to speak some years ago said, "Chastity TEACH VIRTUE AND MODESTY is dead." virtue. The tendency of the times is towards evil. I deplore, and I know my brethren do, the tendency in the world which Latter-day Saints imitate and copy, as far as the women are concerned, at least in their dress. When I was a young man going to school the girls wore dresses that came down to their ankles. 'They were modest. They don't do that now. I went out occasionally in my youth to Saltair to bathe, when the water was up under the pavilion. I had a bathing suit that covered my body to my ankles, so did the men, and so the women. I remember when a young lady came in to go in bathing. She passed one of the men in charge, and he stopped her. He said, "You can't go in dressed like that." Well, she had a dress on that covered her body down below her knees, but he said, "You have got to get stockings on. I hope that isn't true of A woman came into my office one day, she might be here in this group for all I know, and showed me a picture that she had taken, somewhere near the beginning of the century, of a group bathing at Saltair. I tried to get it from her and she would not let me have it. "No," she said, "I am going to keep this, I am in this picture." But every bather was covered — men and women alike. 'That's why I wanted to get it, to see it, to show it. Now they go in bathing together, men and women at the resorts, with very scanty clothing on. Some of our good, clean, virtuous daughters 5 JANUARY 1963 vie to become Miss America or Miss Utah or California or some other State, and they have to be put on exhibition like prize cattle and go through all kinds of stunts, and dress so they have to show their bodies. Pardon me for talking plainly. I think it is disgraceful that we have reached that point in our lives where, as one of my good brethren said several years ago, "Virtue, modesty are dead." Now we need reformation. You mothers in your homes, are you in the habit of letting your little children run around scantily clothed because it is warm weather, practically naked or nearly so? And they grow up that way, that is, thinking that there is nothing wrong in exposing their bodies. What did the Lord give Adam and Eve garments for? 'To clothe themselves, and the Lord does not like nakedness. And I think the Latter-day Saints should not follow the fashions and the immodesty of the world. We are the people of the Lord. He expects us to live clean, virtuous lives, to keep our thoughts clean and minds pure and faithful in the observance of all his other commandments. Why should we follow the world, why can we not be modest, why can't we do the things the Lord would have us do? The Lord bless you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. A Song of Wheels Margery S. Stewart The wagon wheels are high and white, They make a scarring in the snow, The way that wheels do, coming hard Behind the oxen, dark and slow. The wind, a winter Indian, stalks Past tattered canvas, tattered shawl. Crouched on the ridges, broods the night, Like taloned birds, the shadows fall. Then from the farthest wagon back, A grizzled man begins to sing, The song is like him, strong and deep, The music makes a rising ring, A spreading splendor in the dark, To which the others bend their brands. Someone else against the stark Oppression sings out sure and bold. Others... And others... Here and here Until the notes are all held high, A fire of music in the night. Forgotten spectres turn and fly, Once more the wagons circle and stand. The dark shrinks back to the edge of the land. Modesty Protects Virtue Elder Mark E. Petersen Of the Council of the Twelve [Address Delivered in the Officers Meeting of the Annual General Relief Society Conference, October 3, 1962] NDEED it is a great privilege and an honor to be in your presence here this morning, my sisters. I am always humble when in the presence of the wonderful women of this Church. I am convinced that the sisters of the Latterday Saints are truly angelic in many, many ways. I feel confident that you are the stalwarts that lend so much strength to the entire Church through your marvelous devotion, so it is indeed a great honor and a privilege to be in your presence. During the first months following the organization of the Relief Society in 1842, the Prophet Joseph Smith addressed the sisters a number of times. He endeavored to set the standard and show the way for this marvelous organization. One of his principal themes was that the sisters should uphold morality and right and promote virtue among members of the Church. Brigham Young also stressed the importance of the sisters upholding high standards, and, at one time, he said, "These Relief Societies are for the improvement of our manners, our dress, our habits, and our methods of living." The Lord spoke at various times pertaining to the virtues which he expects the Latter-day Saints to preserve. At one time he said, '"Practise virtue and holiness before me" (D & C 38:24). Still later he warned, "... Ye must practise virtue and holiness before me continually" (D & C 46:33). And while the Prophet was in Liberty Jail, the Lord spoke to him and said, "... Let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God (D & C 12:45). Inasmuch as he used the expression, "Practise virtue and holiness before me continually," I feel that the Lord not only spoke of virtue in the sense of chastity, but also in a broader sense, even as we speak of the different virtues represented in our Latter-day Saint standards. Since the Lord seemed to include a general connotation of the word virtue in his revelations, I went to the dictionary to see what it had to say on this subject. Among other things, it gave as definitions, courage, strength, valor, efficacy, excellence, merit, rectitude, purity, and chastity. I was particularly interested for the moment in the word valor which was given as a synonym and, as a result, refreshed my mind on the dictionary definition of that word. Valor was defined as strength of mind which enables one to encounter danger firmly. It stands for gallantry, heroism, personal bravery, and courage. Then I began to ask myself, what are the virtues the Lord had in mind when he urged the saints to "let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly " and "... Practise virtue 7 JANUARY 1963 and holiness before me continually'? My reply was, we must practise the teachings of the Savior by upholding all of the standards of the Church. Without the standards of the Church there is no holiness, nor any virtue either in its broader sense or in the strict definition of chastity. I began to list some of the standards of the Church which pertain to holiness and the various virtues the Lord expects to find in a Latterday Saint. I mention just a few of them: first, "We believe in being true." Again, that is as essential as the gospel itself. Next came, "We believe in being chaste." Benevolence, of course, is mentioned and also patience, long-suffering, brotherly and sisterly kindness, forgiveness, charity, godliness, humility, and diligence. LL of these are essential virtues, but, as I read them, I remembered that one of the definitions of virtue is valor, and that valor is the strength of mind which enables one to encounter danger firmly with personal bravery and courage. Next I asked myself, are our virtues, our standards, in danger? Is there need for valor and courage and strength in meeting such dangers today? 'Then I remembered that in these days there are many dangers which confront us and our families, as well as even our little ones. I remembered that delinquency in the United States is growing at a rate five times faster than the Nation's population; that divorce is reaching new highs even among the Latter-day Saints; that both adult and juvenile delinquency are threatening the solidarity of our homes and families, and that danger is facing us in tremendous proportions. Who can stop this condition? Who can build up our most important defenses? Who has the courage to do so? When I noted that the chief threat is to our homes and families, I remembered that the Prophet Joseph Smith laid it upon the Relief Society women of the Church to protect our homes and families by preserving virtue and holiness. The principal cause of juvenile delinquency is unsatisfactory home life. Unsatisfactory home life results largely from adult delinquency. Adult delinquency is weakening the moral fiber of the Nation. More crimes are committed by people over fifty years of age than by any other age group; the next highest is among those over thirty-five. Since our homes are now placed in jeopardy, how can we strengthen them and resist these evils? Whose influence is greatest in the home? We recognize, without doubt, the place of husband and father, but so often those husbands and _ fathers, themselves, do not recognize their responsibility and abandon it in favor of business or other pursuits. The preservation of the home is left chiefly to the wife and mother. In a large part the home is what the mother makes it. Do our women have the personal courage, the valor, the strength of mind to meet this present situation? ' Are you, the women, willing to be the protectors of our homes and provide the stabilizing qualities our people need in this day of instabil- ity? Are you willing to be the "Rock of Gibraltar" in your homes, resisting the corroding influences of a changing world about you? Do you see what is happening all about us? Let us talk of virtue for a moment in terms of chastity. Do you know what tempts the boys to molest the girls today more than any other one thing? It is the mode of dress of our girls who, in the summertime, often wear extremely abbreviated sun suits, even. On the streets; who wear dresses above the knees, whose clothing about the bust is often so tight and revealing that it nearly takes the breath away from the boys who look at it. It is the low-cut evening dress which permits a boy to dance all evening gazing down into a half-concealed but half-disclosed bosom, thus setting him on fire with an unholy desire. It is so often the very skimpy gymnasium suits girls are forced to wear in their physical education classes at school. WHEN the boys are coming into their teens and reaching maturity, and such sights are placed before. Their eyes, almost like an invitation, can you blame them any more than you would the girls who tempt them, if they take advantage of those girls? Unfortunately, many of these young women are innocent victims of a bad situation. From infancy they wear but little clothing. As they reach early childhood there is still little clothing, and so on into young adulthood. 'They are taught that this is the style and they must follow it. They become accustomed to exposing themselves. It is all MODESTY PROTECTS VIRTUE they seem to know, and who is to blame? Who permits them to dress in this manner? Who buys their clothes? Who is it that permits them to wear lipstick and high heels even before they reach their teens? And who permits them to go dating at twelve, thirteen, fourteen, and fifteen, with little restriction or supervision? And who permits not only this early dating but steady dating as well, steady dating which so. Often leads. To early intimacies, degradation, and loss of this precious virtue of which we speak and, frequently, results in early marriages which almost always break up, even while the youngsters are still in their TECHS. The Lord says we are to garnish our thoughts with virtue unceasingly. Can a boy's thoughts be garnished with virtue while he is looking at the plainly outlined form of a beautiful young woman? Can his thoughts be garnished with virtue as he gazes at her limbs so fully exposed by these short, short skirts of today? Are the girls' thoughts gamished with virtue when they wear revealing clothing? Are their thoughts garnished with virtue while they engage in a petting party, and then hope for an early marriage to cover up their indiscretions? Recent national publication carried an editorial discussing this subject, and among other things said that we must face the fact that more and more American women are unwittingly inviting sex crimes. It was estimated that at least half of the rape cases on the blotter could have been avoided had the victim shown more discretion and 9 JANUARY 1963 good judgment. The peculiarly American system of encouraging our girls to be attractive and alluring, or training them to be seductive, and then telling them of course that they must draw an uncrossable line, was considered as a destructive system. The editorial said that the entire concept of training our young women to "both lure and repel, simultaneously," is responsible for irreconcilable conflicts. A girl is encouraged to believe that the number of her dates and the amount of passion she arouses in them may be in many cases the total measure of her success as a female. And then the editorial calls for a new American heroine, not one who is a sweater girl, whose main claim to fame seems to be the shape of her body and how much of it she is willing to reveal, but the editor calls for a national heroine of virtue and cleanliness, who is willing to put her sex appeal in the background and put forward her wit, her charm, her intelligence, and her integrity. I believe that if the women of this Church could practice the kind of virtue the Lord speaks of, they could change this situation. If they had the valor and the courage they could protect their children by helping them to live up to the Church standards of decency and right. But, mothers, unless you take a stand, your daughters will not take a stand. You must set the requirements, you must make the decision. I was confronted the other day by a group of women who were talking about the leaders of the Church and their attitudes on styles. I told those women that I thought they respect- 10 ed the leaders of the Church as long as the brethren stayed away from certain subjects, but when it came to style, the women of the Church pay far more attention to the style designers in New York and Paris than they do to the appeals for modesty on the part of the General Authorities. The styles of today are immodest, but many women follow them and reject the counsel of the Church leaders. So whom do they sustain, whom do they place first in their lives? When it comes to styles, it certainly is not the leaders of the Church, and yet modesty is the first line of defense for chastity. When our girls and boys lose 'their virtue, we cry to high heaven and wonder why this should ever come to our families, forgetting that in our desire to be fashionable we have set aside modesty, which is the great protector of virtue. OTHERS in Israel, as long as we turn away from modesty in dress and follow the way of the world in style, just that long will we pay the price in a breakdown of morals among the younger generation. Have we the courage to correct this condition? We can have a style of our own, a modest one! We are nearly two million people and no longer a small minority.. But in this we would not be alone. Millions of other women are as modest as we would like our women to be. Recently, one of the colleges of the United States, a non-Latter-day Saint school, had a style show in which every dress shown was as modest as if it had been cut out by the General Authorities themselves. There are many sensible and decent people in the world who would support us. Why can we not join with them rather than with those who are so evilminded that they design styles to emphasize sex, knowing very well that such an appeal is an invitation to sin? Now, may I mention some of the other virtues, particularly the influence of our women in promoting love at home, a spirit of prayer, peace, and co-operation, rather than a spirit of quarreling in the home. Family quarrels breed delinquency of both children and parents. Wouldn't you like to foster the spirit of love and prayer in your home, rather than the spirit of contention? The Savior taught us that the spirit of contention is the spirit of the devil. Let us practice our religion in the home and strive for patience, goodMODESTY PROTECTS VIRTUE ness, forgiveness, and long-suffering, and yet develop the courage to fight evil and put it out of our lives. Is physical exposure compatible with the gospel of Jesus Christ? Is quarreling in the home, is violation of the rules of honesty, is gambling, is violation of the Sabbath day? Oh, sisters, let virtue garnish your thoughts unceasingly. Plan your family life so that virtue will garnish the thoughts of your children also. Be firm and courageous in standing for the right, regardless of what the world designs, or how it may beckon you into its evil pursuits. We must ever remember that while we are in the world we must not be of the world. We must practise virtue and holiness before the Lord always, for so he has commanded us. I pray that we may do so in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Words Written in White Ida Elaine James Today, the world is chastened. Through quiet snows Upon the streets move common mortals, white With winter's luminous aureole; each goes To find his dream or his despair, each bright With brief, ethereal beauty. The quiet air Is pregnant now with loveliness that sifts Magic alike on aging cheek and hair And heads of children laughing down the drifts. There is no sorrow through a world of slow And muted wonders such as these that bring Pulse to the buried wish of long ago, Strength to forgotten prayer, the blossoming Of light, from out a world of death and frost, To April dreams the heart has somehow lost. W Relief Society Magazine's Fiftieth Anniversary Marianne C. Sharp, Editor HIS January 1963 issue of The Relief Society Magazine marks the fiftieth year of its publication by the General Board of Relief Society. The need for periodicals within the Church has always been recognized. With the publication of the modern scriptures came the printing of weekly or monthly periodicals even on foreign soil. Rare and valuable are original copies of such periodicals as The Times and Seasons, the Mormon, The Millennial Star, to mention but a few. It was only thirty years after the saints arrived in the Salt Lake Valley that President Brigham Young saw to it that the sisters had a periodical of their own under the name The Woman's Exponent, excerpts from which have been included in The Relief Society Magazine for the past nineteen years, under the heading "Sixty Years Ago." The Woman's Exponent served as the official publication of Relief Society until 1914, when uniform courses of study were provided by the General Board of Relief Society through a published series of Guide Lessons distributed free which were enlarged in 1915 and known as The Relief Society Magazine. The groundwork for the Magazine was laid at the officers meeting of the General Relief Society Conference 12 in April 1914, and voted upon fayorably. The annual subscription price was to be $1, and the monthly issue was to be forty-eight pages with illustrations. It would require 12,000 paid subscriptions, the sisters were cautioned, to make it self-supporting. At this time in 1914, Emmeline B. Wells, who had been editor of the Woman's Exponent since 1877, was President of the Relief Society, with Clarissa S. Williams, First Counselor, and Julina L. Smith (wife of President Joseph F. Smith) Second Counselor. These _ sisters chose Susa Young Gates (daughter of President Brigham Young) as the first Editor of the new Magazine, with Jeannette P. Hyde, Business Manager, and Amy Brown Lyman, General Secretary, as Assistant Manager. An Advisory Committee consisted of Clarissa S. Walliams, Julina L. Smith, and Rebecca N. Nibley (wife of Presiding Bishop Charles W. Nibley). The offices were at 28 Bishop's Building (just recently torn down). Interesting incidents have been related of how Sisters Hyde and Lyman went up and down Main Street canvassing for advertisements to meet the payroll. President Joseph F. Smith, who was in California in December, sent the following telegram of good wishes: Mes, "ies NS FACSIMILE OF THE COVER OF THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE MON 1915 Description of the cover, from a note in the January 1915 issue of the Magazine: "The beautiful picture on our cover is one of the four bas-reliefs on the base of the exquisite Sea-Gull Monument in the Temple Square, by our artist, M. M. Young. The artist is a grandson of President Brigham Young" (page 44). Ocean Park, California, December 5, 1914. Mrs. Emmeline B. Wells, General Board of the Relief Society: Accept my sincere congratulations and heartiest greetings in honor of the birth of the Relief Society Magazine. May it enter upon its noble mission so firmly entrenched about by the bulwarks of worthy and capable endeavor and enduring truth that its career may be successful and glorious. Josern F. Smrru In the January 1915 editorial "The Mission of Our Magazine" was detailed: It is impossible for us to be sure what any child of ours may become. How much more impossible, then, to forecast what shall be the future, the final character, of this literary infant, newly-born. If the Editor of this enterprise might shape its policy and fashion its fulfilment, she would have this magazine filled with the 13 JANUARY 1963 9 B.. 82 RBS SF!. Xi SOB Ree 4: ara - EDITORS OF THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE At the top: Susa Young Gates, 1914-1922; Alice Louise Reynolds, 1923-1930; Mary Connelly Kimball, 1930-1937. At bottom: Belle S. Spafford, 1937-1945; Marianne C. Sharp, 1945- Spirit of the Lord from cover to cover. In order to do that, no article should be published which would encourage vanity, hurtful luxury, sin, or any evil passion of the human breast. Rather would we make of this magazine a beacon light of hope, beauty and charity. The Christian world have all the virtues. They practice many of the moral precepts of true religion; they are charitable, kind, honest, and intelligent. 'They lack one thing, and one thing only, and that is the Gospel of Jesus Christ in its fulness, taught by those having authority. It is, therefore, the spirit and genius of the Gospel which we would like to develop and expound brightly, attractively, cheerfully, and hopefully, to the readers of the Relief Society Magazine. 14 While the baby Magazine may have been weak financially, it was strong and robust in the message it imparted. The early editorials reflect not only the pressing problems of the day, for World War I had begun before the year was out, but they were also filled with encouragement and exhortations from President Wells who had known the Prophet and undergone the blessings and privations of pioneering and lived on at that late date to lead the women of the Church. An editorial on Success asks the questions, "Who are the successful RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE'S FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY wives?... [They] are the women who learn to balance their lives so that they can give a portion of themselves, unreservedly and with loving generosity, in personal ministrations to their husbands, no matter how exacting the home cares, nor how taxing the responsibilities of the children may be.... Who are the successful mothers?... [They] are the women who have cultivated their intelligence from day to day, so that it has kept pace with the development of their own children. The successful mother has been and is the companion of her children, no matter where their own paths in life may be.... Who are the successful daughters?... The successful daughter may be bright or dull, rich or poor — if she be sympathetic and tenderly unselfish to her mother, she is truly successful." These truths as well as other material in the early issues of The Relief Society Magazine find a responsive chord in the hearts of Relief Society members in 1963. Emmeline B. Wells had been given the responsibility in initiating and heading the grain movement by Relief Society. The first volume of the Magazine narrates her experiences in this movement. The lessons at this time were on Genealogy; Home Ethics; Home Gardening for Women; Literature and Art and Architecture. We learn from the first volume of the Magazine that a member of the General Board, Alice Merrill Horne, was asked to write a textbook for Relief Society on art. Attention was called to the beautiful music rendered by the Relief Society General Choir, and stakes and wards were urged to prepare music for ward and stake Relief Society functions. Readers of The Relief Society Magazine today can judge of the inspiration of the General Board of 1914 in setting forth the mission of The Relief Society Magazine. During its history it has inscribed the history of Relief Society, encouraged and exhorted Relief Society members to selfless service, instructed Relief Society leaders and offered to its readers everywhere the directives, warnings, and inspiration of the leading Brethren. The words of the Prophet of that day, President Joseph F'. Smith, are as vital to Relief Society today as they were then. The counsel of succeeding Presidents — President Heber J. Grant, President George Albert Smith, and _ the prophet today, President David O. McKay, live on in The Relief Society Magazine to guide and bless Relief Society. Susa Young Gates served as Editor from 1914 to 1922. Succeeding Editors have been Alice Louise Reynolds, 1923-1930; Mary Connelly Kimball, 1930-1937; Belle S. Spaftord, 1937-1945; and Marianne C. Sharp, 1945—. The Relief Society Magazine has grown to a periodical of eighty pages, includes color in its pages, and has a subscription price of only $2. It continues to include the lesson work of Relief Society, doing away with the need of Relief Society members to purchase lesson manuals. Its aim is to uplift women in their God-given work as wife, mother, grandmother, homemaker, and charitable neighbor. The Relief So- 15 JANUARY 1963 ciety Magazine stands for the fullest development of a woman's potential as long as her true role as a woman is not neglected nor set aside. Its pages are open today, waiting for Latter-day Saint women throughout the world to inscribe in it their hopes, fears, aspirations, needs, counsel, and conclusions. The beauty of their written words in cadence and rhythm is preserved for future generations. Support the March of Dimes George P.

Belva Barlow Appointed to the General Board Oscar W. McConkie, Jr. First Counselor, University Stake Presidency BELVA BARLOW ELVA Barlow comes to the General Board of the Relief Society with unusual qualifcations. Her appointment came the 14th day of November, 1962. Sister Barlow was my Relief Society president in the University Fourth Ward. To a bishop, this statement is made with profound gratitude and a sense of reverence born of the compassion that this position has come to mean. Belva Barlow was foreordained to her calling. Born to Israel and A. Belva Welling Barlow in East Mill Creek, Utah, such Church service came naturally to the maternal great-granddaughter of the one selected by the Female Relief Society of Nauvoo to serve as the first treasurer of the Relief Society in this dispensation, Elvira A. Cowles. Sister Barlow is prepared for her calling scholastically, professionally, and in character. Before her graduation with honors from the University of Utah, she was elected to five honorary and service organizations. As debate manager she participated in national debate tournaments throughout the United States. Her professional experience includes schoolteaching; employment in Senator Arthur V. Watkin's office in the Nation's Capital; and present work for the world-renowned scientist and Dean of the University of Utah Graduate School, Dr. Henry Eyring. Her character was forged in the fires of Church activities: stake missionary in Washington, D. C.; ward YWMIA president; ward Relief Society president; First Counselor in the 'University Stake Relief Society. By virtue of proper preparation and past performance, the General Board of the Relief Society may expect significant contributions from Sister Barlow. She brings the vibrance of youth to her calling. Her service as counselor in the presidency of the University Stake Relief Society, with its nine ward organizations composed exclusively of college girls, gives voice in the high councils to the freshest innovation and youngest Relief Societies in the Church. Her wholehearted acceptance of this latest call brings energizing effect to the oldest of all auxiliaries in the kingdom of God. 19 Zola J. McGhie Appointed to the General Board Emma Marr Petersen NE would never suspect the presence of the tremendous wealth of artistic talent hidden under the calm, modest demeanor of Zola Jacobs McGhie, called to be a member of the General Board of Relief Society, November 14, 1962. Zola was born to pioneer parents on a ranch in the Snake River Valley, the twelfth in a family of thirteen children. This little girl sang for President Joseph F. Smith when only three years of age in a stake conference meeting, where he was in attendance, and she has continued to use this talent, as well as many others, until the present time. Her entire family was musical and, for recreation, took part in quartets, trios, and duets. As she grew older, Zola played leading parts in local school plays and musicals. She set high standards of achievement for herself from earliest childhood, and worked gladly to pay for lessons in music. At one time, her father turned over to her an acre of ground with sufficient beet seed to produce a crop, the sale of which might be used for music lessons. She planted, cared for, and harvested the crop and was thus able to obtain the best lessons available. She had a number of flattering offers of a musical career from various sources, and, after moving to Salt Lake City, she did a great deal 20 a tad ZOLA JACOBS McGHIE of operatic and oratorio work, often playing the leading roles. She sang in the Tabernacle Choir for twenty years. Brother and Sister McGhie have three children, Sylvia Eagar (Mrs. Todd), Cherie Sorensen (Mrs. Keith), and Frank Lynn. Sister McGhie has been a teacher and stake board member in the auxiliaries and served five years in Church work in Hawaii. She was serving as first counselor in the Bonneville Ward Relief Society at the time of her appointment to the General Board. She approaches each and every task with sincere and humble prayer, intense study, and as much preparation as is possible. 'Truly, the Relief Society will be richer in having obtained the unique talents of Zola Jacobs McGhie. ward Winners The Relief Society General Board ls pleased to announce the names of the three winners in the 1962 Eliza R.

Snow Poem Contest 22 Miranda Snow Walton First Prize Poem Some Late Evening On some late evening I shall walk alone, Along a path I have not walked before; There, in a quiet garden, strange, unknown, A house stands waiting with an open door. The peace that passeth understanding falls Upon my troubled spirit, stills my fears; Out of the sacred dusk a low voice calls, One I have known and loved in other years. I seek my own, for it is end of day, My footsteps turn within the garden gate; I look ahead and know in some sure way Inside those portals dear ones stand and wait. I hesitate no more, my soul runs free Before the falling shadows of the night, The door is open wide, I see — I see To where a loved one waits beside a light. Sego Lilies Impatiently we waited for the snow to melt, Roxana Farnsworth Hase The sun to warm the winter-weary roots; Second Prize Poem Then, kitchen fork and tin pail in our hands, We searched the valley floor for sego lily shoots. How earnestly we took the prize from loosened earth, Brown-coated, small, but succulent and sweet; Manna in a desert not yet blossomed as the rose. How blest we were to share this hidden treat! Stern greasewood fingers caught and held our skirts, Chill gusts of wind made bonnets insecure As self-appointed guardians tried to hide. Some of the precious root bulbs to mature. Thinking only of our present needs, We would have taken all, these hunger-laden hours, But who could doubt the wisdom of the plan To let us also know the beauty of the flowers! 23 Con ao ST SS Kas" Nv Saal 2 ay Attic Rain Third Prize Poem On attic roof there is the sound of showers; Dorothy J. Roberts And on my eyes the sting of inward rain And in my heart with every spring returning, The stored away, recurrent wrench of pain. A broken tool... And here a bit of garden Still dangles from the worn sole of a shoe, The step it took returning every season Past thistled solitude and twigs of yew. Pen-fashioned lines re-read and keepsakes dusted — A slow-resolving memory clinging yet — This barren desert of a love's withholding Indigenous to dust where eyes are wet. The dust from broken days should not be sterile, Tears be but stains upon an attic floor; What wonder wakens in a dry Sahara When the falling rain beats on its hidden door. Heart-cleaning time comes to the April moment, And like the seasonal showers, attic tears Water the roots and nourish new tomorrows — As roses from this dust — the reaching years. 24 im her life, and she was named the Outstanding poet of Wyoming in 1943.

Annual Relief Society Short Story Contest First Prize-Winning Story Annual Relief Society Short Story Contest The Tender Kiss Edith Larson T first Nancy could find no A flaw in John's announcement of his decision. He had looked her in the eyes, smiled naturally, and then, when she threw her arms around his neck and kissed him with all the relief and joy of her sudden release from worry, he had returned her kiss tenderly, Furthermore, he had made the announcement in a normal manner as Soon as he came home from the office. He had come night through to the kitchen and said, "Hi, Nance. Don't bother to pack. I've told J. C. We're staying here." In spite of her flare of joy, Nancy had questioned him thoroughly. She knew she couldn't bear it if, in later years, John should feel that her love and need for her 'family had stood in the way of his career, "But I'm not giving up all Opportunity for advancement," John had reassured her. "J. C. Told me this morming that if [| honestly wasn't interested in the Hawaiian opening, there would be a similar one for me here within a year. What's a year in a lifetime?" And then he had given her the tender kiss and gone out to play wth Terry and the twins in the sandpile. But now, the next morning, as she kneaded the dough for the bread John so dearly loved, she could no longer push back the questions she didn't want to ask. Why, in the midst of her own happiness, should she have nagging doubts of John's? What difference did it make whether he became Stoughton Brothers' youngest department head in Hawaii or in Idaho? The Promotion would further his career equally well either place. Surely J. C. Realized there was no difference. Why had he insisted on holding the Hawaiian job open another week instead of accepting John's decision as final? 27 JANUARY 1963 John was right A short wait wouldn't hurt him — he was only thirty now. And the benefits of staying here were legion. There was this house, a wedding gift from her folks. It had been built just the way she wanted it. When the Hawaiian job had seemed like an opportunity not to be missed, John himself had hesitated over giving up the house. But even more important, there was her family. Her life, except for the four years at college, had been spent in this valley, which had been the family seat since pioneer days. She was the youngest — ten years the youngest — of eight' children, only one of whom had left the valley permanently. By rnghts, she should be spoiled, but John said she wasn't, in spite of the nice little things her family were always doing for her — like her sister Linda taking Terry and the twins off her hands this morning so she could wash and bake without their constant interruptions. Of course Linda thought she was packing, too. Why hadn't she told Linda of John's new decision? As usual her sister had come in like a whirlwind and gone the same way; but, if Nancy had shouted her good news, Linda would have stopped — at least long enough to hug and kiss her. ANCY deftly shaped the dough into loaves and laid each in its place in the neat row of shining bread tins. "Why am I baking bread in the hottest month of the summer?" she wondered. She always did in winter, but—was doing 28 it now some sort of penance, an admission of guilt? But John had made his: own decision. She hadn't influenced it. Perhaps she had been a wee bit slow about starting to pack. Just the thought of moving anywhere out of range of her wonderful family curled her heart into a tight ball. After her first dismay, though, she had tried not to show John how deeply she dreaded the prospective break. But of course he had known. He loved the family, too—had, in fact, adopted them in place of the one he had never known. But still, her people couldn't hold the place in his life they held in hers. She could scarcely imagine a social gathering not tied in with the family. Even her Church life was built around them, though Dad was no longer the bishop. She could hardly imagine trying to rear the three little ones she already had and having another baby six months from now without the help so many aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and grandparents gladly furnished. But she had intended to go to Hawaii as a good wife should — go with fear in her heart, but no protest on her lips. And she would have done it, too—she knew she would have — if John hadn't turned the offer down himself. Then why couldn't she be whole-heartedly glad the way she wanted to be? Why wasn't she singing as she reloaded the washer with colored clothes? Why couldn't she forget how thrilled John had been at the Hawaiian prospect before he began to count the cost? Last night, he had seemed to be satisfied; why couldn't she be? Nancy hung the white clothes on the line instead of running them through the drier. It was a beautiful day to bleach them. Just as she was ready to go after the children, Linda called to say that for once the twins had both fallen asleep over their lunch, so why not leave all three at least until the twins woke up? Then she hung up without giving Nancy a chance to reply. So Nancy toasted herself a_tomato and lettuce sandwich and began sorting and folding clothes. By the time the bread was ready to come out of the oven, she had part of the ironing done and ready to put away, but she was no nearer an answer to the question that plagued her. She would just run through the back lot to the Ellsworths with a fresh loaf of bread. Perhaps talking to someone besides herself would settle her mind. Uncle Gideon and Aunt Martha Ellsworth were not blood relations; they were the last of their family. Both were too crippled with ar- - thritis to get around very much; but, although they rocked their days away — outdoors when it was sunny, by the big window when the weather was unfavorable — there was no more cheerful pair to visit in the whole vallev. HEY greeted Nancy and the bread with delight, protesting that she shouldn't have bothered when she had so much to do getting ready for the trip to Hawaii. Nancv tried to break in with the truth, but trying to stop the flow of talk from Uncle Gideon and Aunt Martha THE TENDER KISS was fruitless. 'They constantly interrupted each other, but no third party stood a chance. "Gideon talks of nothing nowadays except your Hawaiian adventure,' Aunt Martha said, accenting her words to the tempo of her rocking. "You'd think it was." "My own trip," interrupted Uncle Gideon. "It sure puts me in mind of the time Martha and I came across the plains. There was a train most of the way then, ett." "They weren't like these highpowered trains they have today," went on Aunt Martha. "Smoke and grit and red-plush seats and just barely crawling over the mountains. Like as not, you'll take a jet aeroplane where you're going and maybe you won't." "Think of it as an adventure at all. But that's what it is. Don't make a particle of difference if it be a space age or the turn of the century." "When a man and wife make up their minds to strike out on their own and build a new life for themselves and their family, it's an adventure. Yessiree. It's an adventure that takes the good old-fashioned kind of." "Git-up-and-git. Spunk you might call it. Too many young people nowadays don't have spunk any more. 'They're too ready to sit around on their precious security. They don't even know that adventure is calling them!" "Not that you're going to have things rough like we did,' Aunt Martha hastened to assure Nancy. "Hawaii, I hear, is quite civilized 29 JANUARY 1963 and easy living. But it does take courage." "Spunk, I mean, and spunk I'm going to call it. It does take spunk to pull up stakes in a nice, friendly place like the valley, and leaving kith and kin behind, follow where your husband leads. ['m_ right proud to know you, young Nancy," and Uncle Gideon patted Nancy's knee with his gnarled old hand. "And so be I," added Aunt Martha. "We'll miss you sore — you've been the best of neighbors for all you're so young and pretty. Bringing fresh bread over when you know your Uncle Gideon dotes on it, and you so busy and all! Bless your sweet little heart!' And the tears began to trickle down Aunt Martha's withered cheeks. ANCY guiltily made her escape without having summoned up enough "spunk" to tell her good news. So far she had told no one of the change of plans. Why not? Last night it had been late before she found time, but then, why hadn't she at least called her mother? Mom was dreading her going and would have been so relieved. "Tl go and tell Mom right now," Nancy decided as she hurried back across the lot. "I know she's been worrying." Stopping in the house only long enough to pick up her purse with her driver's license in it, she skillfully backed the station wagon down the drive and headed for the familiar old house at the head of the valley. It was only a mile away, but every turn of the wheels seemed to sing a new word — "adventure, adventure, adventure." Curious that 30 to this crippled old couple, the uprooting she had so dreaded should seem an adventure! Was that the way they had felt when they had left all they held dear behind and struck out for the West on their own? For once, there was no car in the long drive that curved around the side of her parents' stately old home. Nancy was glad, for it meant her mother would be alone. Nancy found her in the summer kitchen, washing cucumbers for pickling, working with the quick, sure motions her children knew so well. Her offer to help having been refused, Nancy perched on a stool and wondered how to broach her subject. Mom helped by asking, "Have you and John decided what to do about the house yet?" "We won't have to do anything. We aren't going to Hawaii. John has been promised a similar opening right here if he waits just a little while." Mom stopped long enough to raise a startled face to stare fleetingly at Nancy. 'Then her vegetable brush went back into motion. "T must admit I'm glad," she said simply. "Glad!" exclaimed Nancy. "I'm so thrilled I could cry. It's a re prieve from a fate worse than death — whatever that means." Mom flashed her youngest an amused glance and bent back to her work. "Oh, I doubt if going to _ Hawaii would really have hurt you, Nancy, but — I'm afraid we didn't rear you right to be going off adventuring on your own." SVATHAT do you mean, you didn't rear me right?" Nancy demanded. "No girl ever had a nicer rearing than I did. I loved every minute of it." Mom sighed. "I know. There should have been lots of minutes you hated, lots of minutes in which you were learning to stand on your own feet, fighting your own battles; but somehow—you were such a cute little trick and so much younger and so lovable — somehow your father and I never saw our way to interfering when your older brothers and sisters smoothed the way for you. Which one has the babies today?" "Linda," Nancy answered obediently, but her thoughts were whizrling. What did Mom mean? She had never talked like this before! "Yes, it would be Linda. She added your three to her four at a busy time of the year so you could do what?" "The washing and bake bread. But, Mom, you know perfectly well Pll baby sit for her in return. I always do." "Yes — when your work's done up so you can give all your time to it. Or when one of Sue's girls is visiting you so she can amuse the children." 'Then, as she looked up and saw Nancy's stricken face, she added gently, "I'm not saying this to hurt you, child. But ever since John proposed taking you off on your own, I've been thinking how poorly we who love you so much have prepared you for the responsibilities of being a wife and mother." "But, Mom, I don't ask anyone to help me. They just do!" ' THE TENDER KISS "T know. You're such a dear, it's a pleasure to help you — a selfish pleasure in which we, your doting family, have overindulged. And now I'm wondering," here the busy hands were stilled and Mom looked earnestly at her daughter, "if your being such a dear didn't influence John's decision. I thought he was very enthusiastic over the Hawaiian job. Are you sure he wants to stay?" "Of course I'm sure. It's the promotion that counts — not the place." "Tm glad." Mom bent again to her task. "It's worried me, thinking of you having another baby so soon, way off there by yourself, with Terry scarcely out of diapers and the twins still a year out of kindergarten. Of course, someone of us would have flown out and given you a hand when your time came, but still." Nancy laughed shakily. "And here you were just talking about making me a responsible mother." She jumped off the stool. "I mustn't stick around chatting. I just came to tell you the news. I could have phoned, but I wanted to see your face — I guess. 'Bye now. I have to pick up the children." Somehow, she made it to the car, drove around the circle and up the road until she was out of sight of the house. Then she pulled over on the shoulder and shut off the ignition with trembling fingers. O that was it! No one thought she was capable of taking care of her own family! And even worse — she hadn't thought so either! She had shrunk from the prospect 31 JANUARY 1963 of having to try. Was she really such a poor excuse for a wife and mother? Why hadn't she thrilled with the prospect of adventure as Uncle Gideon and Aunt Martha had done? Could it be that she was so soft and dependent that adventure had no appeal for her? How did her home and her management of it differ from Linda's or Sue's — or for that matter, from that of any of her brothers' wives? Scene after scene flashed through Nancy's mind: Sue's well-ordered household, Tom's, David's, Jerry's. But their children were all older. Only Linda, who had married late, had young ones like Nancy's. Who helped Linda? She rarely seemed to need any help. No matter whom Nancy thought of, she found nothing to compare with the constant assistance her own household seemed to require — or at least receive — from the family. "But I could do it myself — if I had to!" she cried, silently beating her fists on the steering wheel. "It wasnt the ease they put into my life that made me want to stay here. I know it wasn't. I love my family. I'd die in a strange place—alone."' Alone! How could she even think the word alone when John would be with her! "Forsaking all others" — that was what real marriage meant, wasn't it? Did she and John have a real marriage — the kind that had its roots in mutual understanding and trust? They had a home and children — but did they have a marriage? Or had John done the very thing she had denied? Had he let his decision be influenced by — Nancy winced at her own blunt thoughts — her dependence on her family? He had seemed satisfied to stay. If he was trying to protect her, he would never let on to her. So how could she know the truth? She went over last night's announcement again. Why had she felt from the first there was some flaw in it? He had sounded so convincing — just like Dad explaining how things had to be — and then he had given her a tender kiss.... That kiss! It was the kiss a father gives a child. It wasn't a bit like the kiss John had given her when he told her about the Hawallan opening a month ago! Nancy's head dropped forward onto the steering wheel, and for a few moments she wept unashamedly for the happy, unconcerned child she would be leaving here beside the road. Then she dried her eyes, powdered her nose, and drove decisively on to Linda's to pick up her children, her mind already absorbed with the myriad problems of packing.

It is a unique publication, grateful and proud that it is a different Magazine, that it makes no claim to be like any other publication. Its purpose has not changed over the years, although its contents and make-up have many times been adjusted to meet the varying needs of the times and the facilities available for enhancing the attractiveness of the publication. How could The Relief Society Magazine be a facsimile of any other publication — why should anyone desire that it should be so? The Magazine represents Relief Society, both in its historic aspects and in its present greatly enlarged scope and distribution. Just as Relief Society is a unique organization — organized, and in its early days, directed by the Prophet Joseph Smith — so the Magazine is unique, keeping always the same purpose, but being a voice to reach the tens of thousands who now constitute the worldwide sisterhood.. The Magazine links the sister- 34 hood in verisimilitude of purpose and program — assisting in the fields of inspiration, education, and service. The Magazine is the voice that links the past with the everexpanding present. It is as a tree remembering the depth and strength of its roots, yet rejoicing in the number of its branches and the shining glory of its leaves. It is interesting to realize that the Magazine — the messenger — the far-reaching voice — enters the homes of sisters in many lands. It is a cause for much gratitude to know that women of the palms in the far Pacific islands, women of the New Zealand hamlets, women of the Australian cities and towns, women of the historic English villages and towered cities — members wherever there is an understanding of English, are joined together in purpose by the Magazine. Transcending the borders and barriers of nations and of continents, the Magazine carries far and wide a uniting voice. The Magazine, moreover, speaks to women in various phases of their lives.

It inspires the new homemaker to affiliate with Relief Society and become a part of group accomplishment and group spiritual values. 'To the young mother, the Magazine brings the eternal message of sacred family unity, the direction of the habits and abilities and aspirations of children. The woman in the middle years finds her horizons widened, her opportunities increased, by the message of the Magazine. And so it is into the later years, when life becomes enriched by all that has passed, and the ever-present challenge of so much that can be done, so much that can be shared and enjoyed in the later years. So the Magazine binds together the years of a woman's life — and the lives of all women privileged to hear the voice of the sisterhood. The Magazine is not for one land alone, nor for a limited time in any woman's life. It is for many lands and many sisters, for the length of their lives. So it is also for women in many phases of economic condiLaPriel S. Bunker Zola J]. McGhie tions and educational advantages. How wide and beautiful it is for a woman, through the pages of the Magazine, to be inspired to make the most of her means and of herself — what a challenge it is to know that the lesson program, as well as the special articles and _ departments, are planned for all women, whether they are beginners in theology, in homemaking, in literature, or social science — or whether they are in that never-ending process of being added upon. And to the woman who cannot attend the meetings regularly, because of location or employment or illness — the Magazine is indeed the voice of Relief Society — keeping and sustaining these women in their places, giving them an ample portion of inspiration, comfort, knowledge, culture, and beauty. The Relief Society Magazine belongs to every member of Relief Society — a unique messenger — unlike any other magazine available anywhere — our Magazine, serving the purposes and ideals of the sisterhood, representing the women of the Church and speaking for them.

Ellsworth as a member of the General Board, effective October 17, 1962. Sister Ellsworth was appointed to the General Board on April 13, 1955. She came to this responsibility with extensive experience in Relief Society work, having served in various capacities in ward and stake organizations and as Relief Society President of the Central States Mission. During her years on the Board, Sister Ellsworth has conscientiously and devotedly used her many creative talents and abilities in furthering the work of Relief Society. She has accepted assignments whole-heartedly and has filled them capably and efficiently. Her service on the Board has been especially with the lessons and conference and convention committees. She has also ably represented the General Board as a member of the Utah State Nutrition Council. | Sister Ellsworth's sweet, humble spirit and loving nature have endeared her to her associates, and she will be greatly missed by them and by the many Relief Society sisters throughout the Church who have had the privilege of knowing her. The Relief Society General Board members extend to her their love and best wishes and appreciation for her great contribution to Relief Society.

Irene Spencer paused just inside the carved oak door and glanced about her. She stood in an entrance foyer that was larger than many rooms she had seen. Beyond it lay the dark abyss of a room. She shivered a little, and pulled her sweater closer about her. "It's awfully gloomy in here, Dick," she said. His voice came from the depths of darkness. "I know. Wait until I open the drapes." The drag of heavy draperies across a thick carpet made a soft, swishing sound, and raised a dust that filled the close air. Feeble streams of light invaded the room, but the gentle spring sunshine was filtered by dusty glass and wide winA T first glance the house related dow frames until it did little more than break the shadows into shapeless, sheet-covered mounds. Dick moved down to the other end of the long room, pulling sheets off furniture as he walked. Irene stood alone in the louvered archway that separated the foyer and the parlor and surveyed the expanse of room before her. The drapes sagged with dust, and were a dark wine color. The carpeting was just a dirty shade lighter. The wood | paneling that dominated the walls was dark walnut or mahogany. The gaping mouth of an uncovered fireplace resembled a small black cavern. Invading winds had blown loose soot back down the chimney and laid it wantonly on the rug and tile hearth. Those tiles that had not been given a peppery appearance by a layer of soot revealed xii JANUARY 1963 themselves to be a rusty cocoa color, a hue that nearly lost itself in the black soot, red carpeting, and brown wood. The room was musty, heavy with dust, close with disuse. "Can't you open a window? The air in here is so stale." She pushed her pale gilt hair off her forehead, wondering if the dust had settled on it. "Wait until you see the rest of it,' Dick enthused. "It doesn't look like much now, but it's a grand old house." "Tt must be ancient." "Fifty-five... Maybe sixty years old. They don't build houses like this anymore." "Tm sure they don't," she said flatly. Her sarcasm was lost on Dick, who had gone on into the next room. She became conscious of the cold that permeated the room. The thick walls of the house had _ been thoroughly chilled all winter, and the gentle spring sunshine hadn't yet become warm enough to penetrate them. She considered returning to the car for a coat, but thought better of it when Dick called out to her. "Come on, honey. Dining room." Wispy puffs of dust played about her feet as she crossed the length of the room to catch up with him. He had gone through another archway, and now stood beside the largest dining table Irene had ever seen. It appeared that tall garden urns had been painted gold and then drafted into use as legs to support the tremendous thick slab of This is the 38 polished wood. Dick wiped the dust off the table with one of the sheets he still carried. THE ugly carpet had followed her. Identical drapes hung in folds that were gray with dust. Massive furniture stood like shrouded ghosts in gritty sheets. A chandelier hung in suspended grandeur over all, but even its crystal prisms failed to catch or reflect light, because a heavy cloud of grime covered them. Dick dropped the sheets into a heap at one end of the table. "My mother used to entertain in here," he said. "Dozens of people. This room holds lots of memories." He looked about with satisfaction. Irene didn't speak as she found the grimy pull cords and drew back the drapes. After nearly choking on resultant clouds of dust, she saw that the windows here were in the same condition as the others, too smoky to admit much light. "T'm cold," she spoke petulantly. "Tt is clammy in here," he agreed. "No one has lived here since my mother died. 'That's when Granddad moved out, taking me and Davy with him. It was too big and lonely, without her. We'll all be able to come back here to live, now. I know that's what Granddad would like, and it's what I want, too." Irene stiffened, refusing to recall her enthusiasm when Dick had first mentioned such an arrangement — months before their marriage. An old man and a handicapped boy, she thought. In this mausoleum of a house! Before she could voice any objections, Dick reached up and pulled a sheet off a portrait that hung on the wall. "That's my mother," he said. The painted face was totally unlike what Irene might have expected. She must have been a small woman, and much younger than one would have thought. A tender smile played on the sensitive mouth, and wide-spaced eyes looked down into Irene's own. "She was pretty wonderful," Dick said. "Remember I told you what a hard time she had of it? Always wanted a big family, and had to settle for just the two of us, Davy and me. There're twenty years between us, too. Dad died a month or so before Davy was born. He had been sick for years. Davy wasn't healthy either. Mother nursed him through some bad times. She wasn't very strong, and it finally wore her down. She died when Davy was three." "And you went to South Africa." "Somebody had to recoup the family fortunes. Dad's prolonged illness and then Davy's on top of it, bled us pretty dry. All we managed to hang onto was this house, after having been one of the leading families in Spencerside. Mother managed to keep me in school, although [Il probably never know what sacrifices it entailed for her and Granddad. When I was fresh out of school the Government offered me the position in Africa. I needed the kind of money they offered." He grinned at her. "At the time it seemed like the end of the world. Now I'm glad I went. You were there." "What happened to Davy?" Irene KEEP MY OWN asked. 'Was it those illnesses during his babyhood that caused him to be mute?" ICK had always been reticent about discussing Davy's handicap. He hesitated before he replied. "No. It wasn't that. He had learned to talk as well as any threeyear-old when Mother died. It's hard to explain what we all went through then, but Davy most of all. We knew what had happened. We could accept it. He was too little. He couldn't understand. To him, she had just deserted him. When we were getting ready to go to the funeral... He stayed home with Aunt Ella... He somehow got the idea that we were going to get her and bring her home. When we came back without her, he started to cry. Cried for hours. We thought everything would be all nght then. Only it didn't work out that way. It wasn't long before we realized he had stopped speaking. He hasn't uttered a word, since." Her heart twisted with pity. "How terrible for you," she whispered. "Terrible for all of us, but mostly for Davy." A nerve was jerking spasmodically at Dick's temple. Irene touched it tenderly, seeking to soothe it away. "Ym sorry. I didn't completely understand. You never wanted to talk about it." "No one really understands," he said as he took her hand. "How can any adult comprehend the disillusionment and pain and sorrow of a three-year-old child?" He shook his head to drive the memories | 39 JANUARY 1963 away. "The kitchen's in here. Come on." An ornately decorated black stove stood in one corner of the kitchen like a reigning goblin. Its tall black chimney stretched into the shadowy caves of the ceiling far above. 'Iwo dirty windows made little more than narrow slits in black-streaked, dark green walls. Expanses of green cupboards reached an almost unbelievable height. A low old sink stood on carved legs in another corner, beyond a width of green counter top. The floor was a mass of dirty little tiles. Irene scraped some of the accumulated soil off them with the tip of her shoe. They were dark green, too. "We'll have to do some fixing up in here," Dick said lamely. "I had forgotten how out-of-date things "That's a prime understatement," she said bitterly, her tenderness of a moment ago forgotten. She felt him withdrawing from her. Oh, Dick, forgive me. Married only seven months and already it appears I'm developing into a shrew! I don't want to do that. Just give me a little time. Time to adjust to leaving my home, this impossible house Davy. His voice was tired. "I'm sorry you're disappointed. Maybe I painted a rosier picture than I intended. This house is my home. I hoped you could see the gracious living it offers, under the dust and neglect of these past few years." "You admitted yourself it's too out-of-date. I am anxious to make a home for you, but there are limitations to what I can do " How 40 can I tell you I'm frightened at the prospect of living here with your grandfather and your brother? I don't know anything about handicapped children. I'm afraid to even attempt to rear Davy. What if I failed in some way? Oh, Dick, I knew all these things before we were married, and I accepted them all without question. I was so in love! Can anyone, particularly a girl in love, visualize such things? I didn't see a day past that beautiful ceremony in the London temple and the honeymoon that followed. Now the magnitude of it all frightens me. I am such a coward. This house and everything that goes with it are just overwhelming! \ E can't live in it as it ls now," he said quietly, running a thin hand through his prematurely silver-touched hair. "I can see that. I had hoped to set up my studio in the solarium... Sort of an office... Well, modern plumbing and appliances will make all the difference in the world." "Didn't you hear one word I said?" "T heard you, but we have to be practical. If it won't be too much of a hardship on you, I want to try to live here. I would like to rear our baby here, where I was reared. You have judged the house too quickly, anyway. You haven't seen enough of it. Just starting out in business as I am, I have to think of expenses. It would help a lot to have a place here where I. Could work until I'm established. The money I earned in South Africa won't last forever. It's time we got down to the business of living nor- mal lives, Irene. We've been married seven months. That's a pretty long honeymoon. Besides, you knew about this house... And everything else... A year ago." She couldn't deny that. He hadn't hidden anything from her. 'They had discussed it many times. She had always agreed before. It was hard to veto those prior arrangements now. He left her while he went to explore the rest of the house. Irene stood shivering alone in the kitchen, thinking of the years that Dick's family had lived here. Dick's father, Dick, and Davy had all been born in the same room. Dick's parents had both died here. It was no wonder Dick revered the house. The rooms echoed with reverberations from the past that were foreign to Irene. 'The gloom seemed to close in about her, although it couldn't have been much past the noon hour. 'The sun was high outside. She longed for that sunlight as the eerie quiet enveloped her. She drew her breath in deeply through her mouth, and tasted staleness, dead air, dust. She waited for Dick in the deathlike silence of the old mansion that had waited five years for him to come back and resurrect it. Few short hours ago she had felt like the bride she was, then she had stepped across the threshold of this hideous old house. Everything had changed at that moment. Her entire perspective of life had changed. In her own eyes even the view of her marriage had changed. Her complacent happy world had been given a good shaking. She had KEEP MY OWN looked into the past, and tried to look into the future. She hadn't liked what she saw in either place. Unconsciously, she rebelled against it, and wanted no part of it. Irene had been content in South Africa. America was a dream. Zion was perhaps more than a dream, she had even thought of it as the center of her faith, but never as a reality that she might someday experience. Dick had appeared like a Prince Charming from that dream world, a man young in years but already making a deep impression in the field he had chosen. He was a gifted architect. He had gone into architectural engineering at the suggestion of Government officials when he went to work for them. He had traveled like a diplomat, but was a sober young man. Irene sighed, thinking of the Prince Charming she had married. Something moved under the sink. She strained her eyes to see into the Shadows, when without warning a mouse scurried out, across the floor. Irene screamed. Her voice pierced the silence, breaking the dusty quiet. "Dick, Dick!! Oh, Dick, where are you? Dick, Dick, wait for me!" She ran through the door. He, too, had come running at the sound of her voice, and was night outside in the hall. He caught her in his arms. "Irene! What happened? Are you all right?" HE rested in the safe haven of his arms for a moment. 'Then, shamefaced, she looked up into the concerned depths of his gray-green eyes. "I didn't mean to be such a 41 JANUARY 1963 fool. Only, it was so quiet, and dark, and then I saw a mouse. In the kitchen." A convulsive shudder ran through her. He allowed a wave of relief to engulf his frame. "A mouse. You scared me to death. I thought you'd been hurt or something." A deep voice that wavered with age startled them both. "We'll have to get you a cat." "Granddad!" Dick released Irene and hurried to where the old gentleman stood in the kitchen door. They embraced, emotion overpowering their reserve for a minute. Irene remained aside, respecting that emotion and their need to express it. She felt again that foreignness, and wished she could turn about and run far away where she would never have to meet and know this man who held prior claim on her husband. Then she saw the child. He was perhaps eight or nine years old. He stood close to Dick's grandfather, and a little behind him in the shadows. He looked like any other boy his age, at first glance. His blond hair was tousled, and he wore blue jeans with a_ brightly striped shirt. Irene smiled in greeting, and in so doing looked directly into his eyes. She almost gasped aloud. She retreated within herself in horror. Davy was looking at her. He didn't smile in return. In the blue depths of black-fringed eyes that met hers, she read nothing. Emptiness. A blank. There should have been something to read in those eyes! But Davy's eyes were as void as his lips. The child had no expression whatever on his face. (To be continued ) 42 Midwinter Dream Eliza S.

Out of the Wilderness CHAPTER 7 Shirley Thulin Synopsis: Marian Morgan, a widow and mother of six children, has come to Montana to supervise assessment work on the mining property owned by the family. They encounter many difficulties and they mistrust Jake Hadley, the owner of a neighboring mine, who has made protestations of friendship. While Marian and the older boys are repairing the roof on the cabin, three-year-old Jill wanders away and becomes lost in the wilderness. She is found by Jake and his friends and returned to Marian. After this experience and the problems of work at the mine, Marian feels that she must leave the wilderness and return to the city. UE came out of the bedroom S and rubbed her eyes. "You're making so much noise I woke up. What are you doing, Mother?" "Lots of things," Marian said, trying to sound normal. "But it's so early. Not even light yet." "I know it's early. I have a lot to do." "What?" "Go wake the others, and Ill tell you." Marian went from the table to the cupboard to the stove. Her feet felt heavy and her heart even heavier. She had been asking herself questions all morning, but no answers came. It was as though the decision she made in the night had fastened a chain to her soul. Jim came in, barefoot, buttoning his shirt. He looked at his mother and she knew he must be misunderstanding all the preparations she was making. "How's your wrist this morning?" she asked him. "Fine! Just fine." "Let me see it." "Tt's all night, Mom, really." "Jim, it's still swollen. Take the binding off and let's soak it. Then well wrap it again. I'll make a sling so you won't forget and use it. By letting it rest a few days, it will get well." "Going to start packing today?" he asked her, trying to sound casual. "No. The only thing 'm going to pack is a lunch. We're going to need a big one." "Now tell me," Sue said, coming in, "everyone is awake." Marian looked at the sleepy-eyed youngsters coming out of the bedrooms, and couldn't help smiling. There's always something special about children just waking, she thought. "Tell us, Mom," Ted pleaded. "Sue said we're going on a picnic." "Are we, Mom? Are we?" Tommy asked. "Oh, boy, a picnic!' Jed did a little dance around the kitchen floor in his pajamas. "Oh, boy, a picnic," said fill, aancing, too. "Well, I am packing a lunch," 43 JANUARY 1963 Marian said, "but it's to take with us to the mine." "The mine? What are we?" Jim's eyes searched his mother's face. "We are going to go to work. All of us. Jim's going to be the boss and tell us what to do." "Are we going to be miners?" 'Ted asked. '"What's miners?" Jill wanted to know. "Yes, we're going to be miners." Marian handed the bucket to Jed. "Go get the water, Jed, and Sue, you help the little ones get dressed." "Oh, Mother, really." Sue made a face. "I don't know how to be a miner." "Your job will be mainly to watch Tommy and Jill, while the rest of us work. Now, let's hurry, I want you all to eat a good breakfast. Miners always eat a good _breakfast." Jim didn't say anything, but when he looked at Marian, she read the silent tribute in his eyes. Marian locked the cabin door and hung the key by its string around — Sue's neck. As they started along, single file, Jim laughed. "You know," he said, "we must look like the seven dwarfs." "They were miners, too, weren't they?" asked Ted. "Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work we go, Sue began, and in a few minutes, all the children were singing at the top of their voices and keeping time with their feet as the sun came up over the ridge and greeted them. Marian didn't sing. She was too busy trying to keep her hurt where it belonged. She didn't want 44 "mountains?" Jim to know how painful her decision had been to her. "T like to be a miner," said fill, singing louder than all the rest. |X the days that followed, Marian and her family were more than miners. 'They were gardeners and painters, and, as Marian put it, "We're getting to be pretty good fixer-uppers." They took turns weeding the garden and irrigating it with the water from their little stream. Marian and Sue washed the clothes and ironed and painted the kitchen bright yellow. When Dick brought her the paint, he teased her. "Trying to bring the city to the he asked. But she knew he approved of the things she was accomplishing, and always ng left with a handful of fresh pea from the garden to shell and ¢ eat on his way back to town. Jim helped his mother build some more shelves in the kitchen, and a closet in the corner of her bedroom. But mostly they went to the mine and cut down small trees for lumber and_ tied ropes on them to drag them to the clearing. 'They hauled dirt to the road and smoothed it and tramped it down firmly to make the road flat. Night after night Marian went to bed so tired she couldn't go to sleep for hours, but she knew she was doing what had to be done, and was almost glad of the work to keep her mind busy. Whenever she was tempted to be overcome with a feeling of drudgery, she needed only to look at Jim to be rejuvenated. He was so happy, he beamed all over. The other children were happy, too, and this made Marian feel somewhat justified. The evenings were pleasant. After the supper was over and the dishes washed, Sue and Jim or Marian took turns reading aloud to the others, or they worked on their Remembrance Books, or read. Sometimes they just talked. But the loneliness that came to Marian sometimes sickened her deep inside, and only another day of accomplishment could chase it away. NE day Marian and the small children stayed. At the cabin. It was her baking day and she wanted to paint the bench Jim had made from half a log. "Now everyone will be able to sit on a chair of his own," he had proudly announced as he finished it. There were only four chairs in the cabin when they came. "That's nice, Jim. This will seat the three littlest members of our family just fine," Marian told him. Marian took the paint and brushes out in the dooryard. She loved to be outside as much as possible, where she could keep an eye on the children, and look up now and then from her work to the inspiring skyline. Somehow this was an_ especially lovely morning. She was painting and humming a little tuneless song of her own composing, when the sound of a car coming up the canyon road made her pause. Fill and 'Tommy came running to het. "We've got company." "Somebody's coming." "Dick, I suppose," Marian said, though it wasn't Saturday. Then, as the car rounded the bend, she let her breath out in surOUT OF THE WILDERNESS prise. It was Charles. She thought of running into the cabin to change her clothes and do something with her face, but what? She didn't have any better clothes with her, and there wasn't much she could do in a minute with a sunburned, peeling nose, and skin that had had more weather and less care than at anv other time in her life. She did pull the bandana from her hair, and tried to smooth the falling locks back from her forehead, as Charles got out of his car and started towards her. "Marian!" his eyes were searching deep into her own. "Hello, Charles." "Oh, Marian, what has happened to you? You look." "Like a weatherbeaten old pioneer?" she supplied the missing words. "No... But you do look tired, wornout. What have you been doing?" "Oh, that's not so important. What brings you to the wilderness?" She was teasing him now, teasing to cover up her embarrassment. He was so clean shaven, and white collared. He wore a tie, and his shoes were so shiny she could almost see herself in them. "T came to. Oh, Marian, I've been so worried about you. No word.... You haven't written to anyone." '"Haven't had time, really. I have dropped a line or two to Mother." "Marian, I came to take you back." "We don't want her to go back." They had forgotten the children. "T mean you, too, 'Tommy." 45 JANUARY 1963 Charles patted him on the head. "Me, too?" said Jill. "Yes, all of you." "We don't want to go back." Tommy was emphatic. "Marian, has it been too awful? You look so...." "We've been working hard, and accomplished a lot. You will have to let me show you what we have done." She managed a sort of smile, but her thoughts kept saying, Charles, why didn't you let me know you were coming, so I could have been prepared? It isn't fair for you to find me here like this, with paint on my hands, and skinned knuckles, and shiny nose. Are you laughing at what you see? Are you feeling sorry for me? That is even worse. But aloud she said, ""T'ommy, take Charles and show him our little stream and our well while I put the paint away. Then we will walk to the mine and." She stopped. Suddenly she wasn't sure she wanted him to see what she had been doing at the mine. She was sure he wouldn't understand. He will probably think I've lost my mind, she thought. "We used to have a baby deer, but he ran away." Tommy took Charles' hand and led him toward the path. Marian stood there for a moment, the tears stinging her eyes, the paint brush still in her hand. Then she went inside and tried to put cream on her face and brush her hair, and give herself a manicure all at the same time. When they came back, she felt a little better, and from the look in his eyes, she guessed Charles 46 thought she looked a little better, too. THE walk to the mine was pleasant, and they saw squirrels scamper and heard them scold. They walked slowly and talked of the tall trees and white clouds, rather than saying what was really waiting to be spoken between them. And the two children ran and skipped ahead. "It is very beautiful here," Charles said. "Too bad it has to be so far away from everything." "Maybe that's part of its charm," Marian defended. "But the silence, especially at night, would get on my nerves. I've tried to vacation in the mountains several times... No television, no telephone, not even any lights...." Marian was silent. Two months ago she would have agreed with him, why not now? She was homesick. She longed to see a show, or to listen to her favorite records, but it wasn't a painful longing.... They came to the mine, and saw Jim dragging a tree to the clearing. "Hi, Jim. Look who came to visit." Marian was glad Charles was seeing Jim drag the tree, and hadn't caught her doing it. Not that she was ashamed of the work she'd been doing, but... Well, she was just glad he had found her painting, instead. "Hello, Charles." Jim came over to where they stood, his wide grin telling of his satisfaction and of his pride in his work. "Hi, Jim. Looks like you are doing quite a job here." "We're trying to fix the place up qa bit. Not much time left, and still lots to do." 'Jim has been slowed down a bit with a sore wrist, but it's better now,' Marian said. "Would you like to look inside the mine? We have been retimbering the first level, that is, Jim has." Charles went over and looked inside. He didn't step inside, just looked. "You can't see much from here. We haven't done the front yet. Jim started quite far back and worked forward. Here, put this helmet on, and I'll show you." Charles stepped back from the mine. "It's all very interesting." he said. "But why? I mean, why all this work? From what David told me long ago, I gathered there is no ore left." "Oh, yes, there is, it's just too expensive to ship." Jim was quick to explain. "You see, there isn't a mill nearby. If someone were to build one, we could start mining again." Marlan was surprised that she remembered what Jim had told her. Charles shook his head. "Learn something new every day," he said, and Marian could see that he had dismissed the subject. She knew that he didn't intend to go inside the mine or want to hear any more about it. 'Two months ago she would have understood, but now, suddenly, it was her mine, too, her logs, her nice, smooth dirt road. "Jim, why not quit for toddy?" Marian suggested. "We'll go on a picnic." 'Then she said to Charles, "There is a little lake on the other side of that hill. I think you would OUT OF THE WILDERNESS enjoy the scenery there. You stay here while Jim finishes up, and Sue and I will go back and prepare some food." HEY stayed longer by the lake than they should have. It was so good to have someone to talk to. Charles told of what had been going on with all the people back home, and of what was going to take place in the future. "The big teen dance is coming up next week, Sue," he said, "and, Marian, there is a dinner and fashion show next week. Why don't you come home with me? Looks to me as if you have all earned a rest." "The garden would die and some of the things aren't mpe yet," Sue said. Marian looked at Sue, then at Jim. 'They exchanged an unspoken question and answer. "We can't leave now, Charles, we haven't finished our work." That's what she said, but inside she was saying, yes, we will go right now, right this minute. She was remembering the good _programs that were always held in the fall of the year, and the garden show, in which she had taken such an active part, and she longed for a visit to the beauty shop, or just to walk along the smooth pavement to the grocery store. "Please, Marian. You could have your things shipped. It would be so much easier than to go alone on the train." "IT know, but I can't, really, Charles.". "Marian, there's a special reason why you must-come with me now." AT JANUARY 1963 "We'll be home in only a few weeks...." Marian sensed what he was about to say, and didn't want him to say it not now. She called the little children, who were playing close by, and told them to start gathering the things together. She hoped Sue and Jim hadn't guessed what Charles had almost said to her. On the way back, Marian was glad for the evening canyon breeze as it cooled her hot face, and gave her a subject for conversation. 'They also talked of the long shadows the trees made and the way the leaves were beginning to turn red and gold on the higher trees, but they didn't talk of what was in their hearts, not right then. When they reached the cabin they talked of the old-fashioned stove, and how long it had been since he had seen one like it. And Charles looked at Tommy's rock collection and at Sue's finished pillowslips while Marian put the little children in bed. It was all quite homey, only Marian could feel the tidal wave within Charles. When he stood up to leave and asked her to walk out to the car with him, she knew she would have to listen to him-now, and to find an answer from within her heart. "Marian," he said, and she watched the huge moon peek from a cloud before she answered. "Please, Charles, don't say anything now. P'll be home in just a little while, then we can deGe. "No, Marian, it has to be decided now. I have to leave right away for 48 a two months' business tour. I want it to be our honeymoon." "But the children...." "Your mother said she would take care of them. I won't get any more time off for at least another year.... Please, Marian." we. 7 "Tll make you happy. You'll never have to do anything like this again... Leaving the city... Working so hard." "It hasn't been so_ bad. Learned to love the mountains." "Don't you care for me?" "T... I don't know, Charles. I thought I did just before I left home, but now... Things are different." "We can come back here for a little while each summer. A week to fish and rest." "But if we don't finish the work were doing, we'll lose the place. I don't want that." "You don't want it? Or is it Jim you're thinking about?" Marian searched within herself a moment. "Charles, I can't go. I can't marry you not now, maybe not ever. I've felt so close to David here, and it will take time." "Marian, you need someone." "Please give me time." He looked at her a long while. "Goodbye, Marian," he said, then turned and got into the car. As the flicker of the red taillights disappeared in the night, she said his name. Over and over she said it, "Charles. Oh, Charles, I do need someone."

Sister Crowther reports: "The stake board of the San Luis Stake Relief Society would like to share with you a very pleasant spiritual as well as social experience we have had in our stake. Homage was paid to the early-day pioneers on Tuesday, June 5, 1962, at a very lovely Relief Society anniversary party at the stake house in La Jara, it being seventy-eight years since the organization of Relief Society here in the San Luis Stake. Many women from the six wards were in attendance and participated in the program which was centered around the pioneer theme and was carried out in song and costume. An original play written by Lena Mae Hansen of the Sanford Ward and entitled 'Relief Society Treasure Chest,' was presented. Esther Smythe, stake chorister, composed words for two songs which fit in nicely with the play. The refreshment table was most attractive with a beautifully decorated Relief Society birthday cake done also in the pioneer motif. On both ends of the table were miniature covered wagons. 'Tiny wagon wheels decorated individual pieces of cake, with a larger one set in ice to float in the punch bowl. We feel that this event was very successful, because we had many in attendance who are not members of Relief Society and some who are not members of the Church. Through this social we feel that we are helping the fellowshipping program and perhaps we are taking the first steps toward interesting more sisters in the grand work of Relief Society."

The cake was very beautiful and was decorated with the seal of Relief Society. It was served with punch in the afternoon. Lunch was sold at noon and all the proceeds were kept by the participating wards and branches: Carson City, Fallon, Fernley, Hawthorne, Lovelock, Mt. Rose, Mt. Rose Second, South Tahoe, and Yerington. The festival was advertised throughout the stake, and invitations were issued to nonmembers, as well as to active and nonactive members. Many nonmembers attended, and we feel that it was a fine way to show what the Relief Society work department has to offer. Several hundred people attended, including many Priesthood members. Everyone participating was very enthusiastic, and we are looking forward to making the 'Work Festival' an annual affair.

Erekson, President, Swiss Mission Relief Society, sends the following report from Doris Caulder: "On the first Tuesday of October 1960, the Naples, Italy, group of Relief Society sisters held their first meeting at the home of Lucille Crockett, with six sisters present. These sisters, so far from home, were thankful for the opportunity to meet together. Their willingness to serve and carry on has helped each to become better acquainted and strengthen the bond of true spiritual sisterhood.. "It was decided that the meetings would be held in the homes of the sisters, the hostess presiding. The sisters took turns in presenting the lessons as outlined in The Relief Society Magazine, and all looked forward to the delicious luncheons and exchange of recipes on work meeting days. Relief Society activities have been educational and varied. Pajama bags and toys were made and presented to each child by Santa at the Christmas party held in the home of Sister Cotter. The Relief Society birthday was celebrated by a shopping trip through the curious, winding streets to out-of-the-way factories and city shops. The Singing Mothers have enjoyed presenting special numbers for sacrament meetings and conferences, and there have been many opportunities to teach the gospel to nonmembers, both Italian and American, who have attended the meetings. A permanent organization is now functioning with a membership of nine." 54 Katherine W.

Doxey THEOLOGY e The Doctrine and Covenants (Text: The Doctrine and Covenants, Section 63:1-21) For First Meeting, April 1963 Objective: To learn that the person of faith is justified by the Lord, but the sign seeker is condemned by the Lord. Background HE Prophet took leave of Missouri where he had received new revelation dealing with the founding of Zion, the city of God, and numerous matters relating to the gathering of the saints. Arriving in Kirtland the Prophet wrote: In these infant days of the Church, there was a great anxiety to obtain the word of the Lord upon every subject that in any way concerned our salvation; and as the land of Zion was now the most important temporal object in view, I enquired of the Lord for further information upon the gathering of the Saints, and the purchase of the land, and other matters, and received the following [Section 63] (DHC 1:207). Wickedness and Rebellion Section 63 begins with the call for the saints to listen, to open their hearts to a revelation of the Lord's word. (D & C 63:1.) All men should understand that God is angry with the wicked. Some members of the Church may be classed as stiffnecked (stubborn) and unbelieving as well as those who have not made covenant with the Savior. The Lord's displeasure is also shown toward the rebellious. Rebellion against God's law makes a person wicked. Such people willfully defy God after knowing his will toward them. This was true of Lucifer and the third part of the hosts of heaven. (Ibid., 29:36-37.) King Benjamin in The Book of Mormon taught that rebellion against teachings received brought a withdrawal of the Spirit. (See Mosiah 2:36-38.) The rebellious are condemned because of their having accepted gospel principles and then having disobeyed them. Greater responsibilities bring greater blessings, but, if not carried out, they bring greater condemnations. (D & C 1:2-3; 82:3.) The degree of condemnation is dependent upon the nature of the disobedience and the light enjoyed by the member. 57 JANUARY 1963 The Lord's Power God's power is understood when men realize that he controls life and is able to cast men into hell. The wicked and rebellious, knowing that they have flaunted their Maker, are fearful that death may overtake them. 'The ever-present question is, "What will be my situation after death?" God can do all things even to destroying the world, as well as "to cast the soul down to hell" (D & C 63:3-4). The unrepentant will not escape the Lord's wrath: Behold, I, the Lord, utter my voice, and it shall be obeyed. Wherefore, verily I say, let the wicked take heed, and let the rebellious fear and tremble; and let the unbelieving hold their lips, for the day of wrath shall come upon them as a whirlwind, and all flesh shall know that I am God (Ibid., 63:5-6). In like manner the revelations describe the condition of those who do not hearken to the Lord's message. (Ibid., 84:95-102; 133:71-73.) On the other hand, the Prophet Joseph Smith says that blessings of a celestial nature await those who obey the Lord's voice:. God has in reserve a time, or period appointed in His own _ bosom, when He will bring all His subjects, who have obeved His voice and kept His commandments, into His celestial rest. This rest is of such perfection and glory, that man has need of a preparation before he can, according to the laws of that kingdom, enter it and enjoy its blessings. This being the fact, God has given certain laws to the human family, which, if observed, are sufficient to prepare them to inherit His rest (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, page 54). Signs Shall Be Seen As one evidence of the last days, signs are to be seen. Many types 58 of natural phenomena are mentioned in scriptures. The ones generally known are those which are to appear in the heavens, such as the sun darkening and the moon turning to blood. (D & C 29:14; 34:9; 45:42; 88:87.) Other ocular signs will be observed. (Ibid. 29:14; Pearl of Great Price, Moses 7:61.) But these are not the only signs predicted for these times. There are those who desire to have some visual demonstration, such as a miracle, to evidence the existence of God, of the divinity of his Church, of the divine calling of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and the truth of the principles of the gospel. One desire for some "tangible" evidence of the work of the Lord in our times is the belief that the gold plates of The Book of Mormon should be on display for those who want to "know" that Joseph Smith had plates of ancient origin. These plates, if put on exhibit, would not give evidence of the truth of The Book of Mormon to those who would not accept that scripture on faith or seek for the testimony of the Spirit. Great faith would still be required to believe that these particular plates were of ancient origin or that the characters were what the Prophet claimed them to be. Disputations would probably not cease concerning these claims. Men are not converted to the gospel by such visual demonstrations. The Lord does not give man such demonstrable evidence to convert him. Faith continues as the principle to test man's alle giance to God and the only way that the rich blessings may be enjoyed. (Hebrews 11:1.) The testimony of the witnesses to The Book of Mormon condemns those who reject that testimony. (D & C 5:10 20. ) The Lord has given evidences or signs that men may understand his purposes, but these may not be so apparent to the person who is not looking for these evidences. The missionary calls signs to the attention of his hearer, such as evidence that these are the days when men are called to repentance for the last time. (D & C 33:2-3; 39:17; 43:28; 90:2.) What are some of these signs? Among several which might be mentioned, these three stand out significantly: (1) the coming forth of The Book of Mormon. As the Old 'Testament prophets predicted many about this volume, they indicated that men should know of God's work in the last days by the fulfillment of such prophecies. (Isaiah, Chapter 29; Ezek. 37:16-20.) Associated with this first sign to give evidence of The Book of Mormon is the second one; (2) the gathering of Israel, particularly the Jewish portion. (Isaiah 29:17-19, 22-23; ' Ezek. 37:21-28.) One of the remarkable historical events of our times is the return of the Lord's ancient covenant people, Judah, to the land of their inheritance. The establishment of this one nation, Israel, in Palestine, in 1948, serves to remind all people that with the return -of Judah to the holy land, God is remembering his people as prophesied. (Jeremiah 31:31, 33; 2 Nephi 20:29-31.) He is remembering not only Judah, but others of the tribes of Israel, especially Jodetails: LESSON DEPARTMENT seph — the Indians, and also the Latter-day Saints who have been gathered from the nations. (I Nephi 19:13-16. ) ) The third sign — a definite sign of the last days — is that of the wars, rumors of war and preparations for, together with disease, earthquakes, famines, floods, and other natural calamities that are so evident on the earth today. (Lesson 30, Relief Society Magazine, December 1960.) 'These three signs are some of the Lord's ways of letting man know that now is the time to repent, and that these signs are to help in man's conversion to the fulness of the gospel. Sign Seekers in the Church When Section 63 was received in August 1831, there were members " who had come into the Church seeking signs, as there are probably some today who expect some miracle to convince them further of the truth. Concerning these members the Lord gave verses 7-12 of Section 63. The Lord is not pleased with those who seek signs to convince them of the truth. Signs shall follow, but not always the kind of sign desired. They may be in the form of judgments because of wickedness. 'Those who sought for a sign in the time of Christ were classified as an evil and adulterous generation. (Matt. 12:38-39.) Sign-seekers show a lack of faith in God and, therefore, the desired sign is not forthcoming to their salvation. Sign-Seekers, Some Examples Some notable examples of signseekers are found in The Book of Mormon. Lacking in faith they 59 JANUARY 1963 sought some visual demonstration of God's power as a convincing sign. Several centuries before Jesus' birth a Nephite named Sherem denied that there would be a Christ as Jacob, son of Lehi, and other prophets had declared. Like many modern doubters, including men of religious profession, it was claimed that "no man knoweth of such things; for he cannot tell of things to come" (Jacob 7:7). Jacob bore a solemn witness that prophecy from a prophet of God is true and that Christ would come to the earth, but Sherem demanded a sign. (Ibid., 7:11-13; read also 14-21.) Another example of one who denied prophecy and the coming of Christ was Korhor. The prophet replied to his request for a sign that there is a God as follows: Thou hast had signs enough; will ye tempt your God? Will ye say, Show unto me a sign, when ye have the testimony of all these thy brethren, and also all the holy prophets? The scriptures are laid before thee, yea, and all things denote there is a God; yea, even the earth, and all things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its motion, yea, and also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator (Alma 30:44). An Important Principle This reply, with other experiences, emphasizes an important principle based upon the fact that God is no respecter of persons and that all men must acknowledge him. The Lord gives the same signs to all men, but if they receive a sign without faith, it will be to condemnation. For the faithful member of the Church there may be many "signs" 60 received, if asked in humility and for the person's good unto the glory of God. (I John 3:22.) Signs come by faith which brings forth righteous deeds. Men may develop faith by greater and continued acts of righteousness. The signs received by the humble saint are blessings received from the Holy Ghost. (D & C Section 46; Lesson 32, Relief Society Magazine, February 1961.) 'These blessings are intended principally. To prevent the member from being deceived, although they may serve to strengthen faith and bless with the power of God. The miracle as an instrument of conversion was never intended in the gospel. It has become axiomatic with Latter-day Saints that the person converted by the miracle may require a miracle to keep him in the Church. President Brigham Young declared:... When the voice of the Good Shepherd is heard, the honest in heart believe and receive it. It is good to taste with the inward taste, to see with the inward eyes, and to enjoy with the sensations of the ever-living spirit. No person, unless he is an adulterer, a fornicator, covetous, or an idolator, will ever require a miracle; in other words, no good, honest person ever will (Journal of Discourses 8:42). Sins Revealed When the sign or miracle is granted to the faithful member of the Church for his personal benefit and the glory of God, the sign attests to the fact that the spiritual gifts are a part of the gospel. Due to darkness of mind and sin, some members desire evidence of God's existence or the truth of the Church byasign. In 1831 there were members who felt this same way. Commandments of moral purity had been given, but some had turned away from them. (D & C 63:13.) Among these covenant - breakers there were adulterers and adulteresses, a number of whom had turned away from the faith, but there were others who had not apostatized but in time they would be known. (Ibid., verse 14.) 'The thought suggested in this and the succeeding verse (verse 15) should be understood by those who are tempted to sin or who have sinned and remain unrepentant. It is that this person shall be known and labeled in the eyes of the people. There follows the significant fact stated in another revelation, that the thought precedes the deed of immorality. (Ibid., 42:23.) The consequences of immoral thoughts for the Church member are loss of the spirit, denial of the faith, and the resulting fear because of the consequences in time and _ eternity. (Ibid., 63:16; Lesson 27, Relief Society Magazine, September 1960.) Condemnation of the Sinner President Joseph F. Smith considered that of all principles of the gospel which emphasized the attributes of justice in Deity is the fact that all men will be rewarded for their works, whether they be good or evil. (Gospel Doctrine, 9th edition, page 69.) In accordance with this truth, the Lord has revealed much concerning the final state of the unrepentant sinner. Language similar to what was later revealed concerning the salvation offered to those who willLESSON DEPARTMENT fully sin with knowledge, is given in this revelation. Belief in false teachings or unbelief in the doctrines as restored to the Church in this dispensation, constitutes in the member a form of falsehood or misrepresentation of belief. The member of the Church is committed by covenant to believe the doctrines and to live the principles that the Lord has revealed. The condemnation for those who love and make a lie, and the immoral, is to receive the telestial kingdom. (D & C 63: 17-18; 76:98-107.) They suffer the vengeance of eternal fire to receive the torment of conscience, which is like an unquenchable fire. (Mosiah 2:37-38.) The mental torment of those who receive the lake of fire and brimstone is described by the Prophet Joseph Smith in this way: A man is his own tormentor and _ his own condemner. Hence the saying, They shall go into the lake that burns with fire and brimstone. The torment of disappointment in the mind of man is as exquisite as a lake with fire and brimstone. I say, so is the torment of man (DHC VI:314). Because there were immoral members in the Church, some having left but others to be ferreted out if they did not repent, the membership was not justified in allowing these conditions to exist. (D & C 63:19.) 'The Lord has prescribed excommunication of these persons unless they speedily repent. (Ibid., 42:24-26, 80-81, 87.) The Faithful Are Justified Those, however, who endure in faith by keeping the commandments are promised great blessings, even 61 JANUARY 1963 beyond their present comprehension. Nevertheless, he that endureth in faith and doeth my will, the same shall overcome, and shall receive an inheritance upon the earth when the day of transfiguration shall come (D & C 63:20). Familiar to students of the scriptures is the meaning of "overcome." As used in the above verse, the person of faith becomes free of the bondage of sin by overcoming the sinful habit or impediment to his eternal progression. (Romans 6:18; 2 Peter 2:19.) 'They shall overcome all things and receive an exaltation in the Father's kingdom. (Rev. 21:7; D & C 84:38.) The Day of Transfiguration For those who have overcome through faith, an inheritance upon the earth is promised. (Matt. 5:5.) For this intent was the earth created. (D & C 88:17-20.) But before the earth is celestialized as the home of celestial beings, which is its final transfiguration, the Lord has said that the earth shall receive a regeneration (Matt. 19:28), for it will be restored to its former condition as a paradise. The 'Tenth Ar ticle of Faith mentions that the "earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory." 'Thus the earth will be restored to its former state when it is transformed to the condition before it fell to its present telestial state. (D & C Commentary, page 377.) Questions for Discussion 1. Name the three signs given in the lesson that are present in the world today. 2. In what way do these three signs constitute powerful evidence to support the fact that the Lord has spoken from the heavens in the last days? 3. What is the purpose of signs for the faithful saint? 4. Tell what blessing in Section 63 is promised the faithful member of the Church.

Robinson or First Week, April 1963 "It Is Not Meet That | Should Command in All Things" bjective: To emphasize the fact that it is through the exercise of free agency that we evelop initiative and self-reliance. REE agency is a fundamental part of the gospel; in fact a war as fought in heaven over it. Our Father in heaven counsels s to pattern our lives on night nnciples. He has given us laws d commandments as _ guides, hich, if followed, will assure us ppiness in this life and joy in the orld to come. Nevertheless, he allows us to exercise our own judgpent and free agency in the applicaion of these principles and in following these commandments. Only in this way can we learn, grow, and progress. One purpose of free agency is to enable us to develop sufficient initiative that we will not need to be commanded in all things. In fact, when the Prophet Joseph Smith was asked how he governed his people he replied, "I teach them correct principles, and they govern themselves." This wise principle of living was also emphasized by the Savior in his parable of the unprofitable servants. In this parable Jesus asked, "Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him?" 'The Savior responded in the negative to his own inquiry and then added: "So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do" (Luke 17:10). Not only should we follow the Lord's specific commandments, but to be profitable servants, we should go the extra mile and use initiative and free agency in doing good and in living true Christian lives. One reason why our Father in heaven encourages us to exercise our free will and judgment is so that we can develop confidence and selfreliance. There is an old story which states that some of the ancient alchemists believed that if they could find one special element they could change some of the common baser metals into pure gold; but this rare element always eluded them. A similar rare element of character, however, need not be so elusive. This important character element ls self-reliance in combination with 63 JANUARY 1963 humility. In order to build successful lives we must have confidence and self-reliance in our own Godgiven talents and abilities. Plato said, "Take charge of your lives, you can do with them what you will." In his wisdom he knew that those who were self-reliant sought constantly to discover and overcome their own shortcomings which kept them from accomplishing the things they were capable of doing. Someone has wisely said, "No man has made a great success of life or a fit preparation for immortality by doing merely his duty," and The Doctrine and Covenants states, ". For he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward" (D & C 58:26). President Henry D. Moyle expressed this thought beautifully when he said, "We ourselves must act. We must initiate our own search for truth of our own free will. Once we do, the Lord magnifies us, fills our souls with his holy spirit " (CR, October 1959, page ). Ret us follow the admonition of the Lord and do many things of our own free will, "and bring to pass much righteousness," for the Lord has said, "For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward" (D & C 58:27-28). WORK MEETING The Latter-day Saint Home (A Course Expected to Be Used by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting ) Discussion 7 — The Latter-day Saint Home Exemplifies Thrift Dr. Virginia F'. Cutler For Second Meeting, April 1963 Objective: To show that a family can know the feeling of security through work and the wise use of resources. HE main ideas of this discussion are given through the use of a flip chart.* The four messages for the chart follow: *A flip chart has messages written and illustrated on large sheets of white wrapping paper or cardboard and fastened together on a stick and hung on an easel. As one message is given, the sheet is flipped over for the next. 64 1. Keep out of the deficit spending trap. Plan your budget on your terms. 2. Avoid revolving credit. Consider costs of using other people's moncy. 3. Watch that garbage can. Use resources wisely.. Add many dollars to your income through thnfty home management. The Family Values Test in the first discussion started out with checking the family value of security. Keeping out of debt, wise use of resources, a nest egg for a rainy day, and a high credit and character rating are listed as essential for realizing this value. The trap of deficit spending is keeping a great many families from knowing the meaning of security under these terms. Deficit spenders don't have to keep a budget; their money is spent automatically through unvarying monthly payments. Through motivation — research, the business world has learned ways to help the family get rid of the rest of the paycheck in a similar withholding pattern. We are urged to take two vacations a year, to buy a second car, to sign for a package mortgage on all the known gadgets. Pay after you get is the mode, and the paycheck is spent before it is earned. The optimism of some newly married couples is astounding. They assume there will be a continually expanding economy and that future prosperity will retroactively pay for today, and there is no sense in selfdenial. If a dealer reports that financing can be arranged through a local bank, they relax their guard completely and debt starts on a path which often becomes the perpetual family street. Ing operates largely to lull people to insensitivity and more debt. Thrift, initiative, challenge, and struggle are words that will gradualDeficit spendLESSON DEPARTMENT ly become obsolete if this trend continues. Revolving credit is deficit spending carried to its ultimate conclusion. It is allowed by retailers to people who do not rate a charge account. A family might be given a $200 credit limit which must be paid off in regular installments with al tol% percent monthly interest charge on the unpaid balance. Once the family gets into this trap, they seldom get out, for they always like to be bought up to the limit. The family is paying annually a twelve to eighteen per cent interest charge for this convenience. Some homemakers throw money out of the back door by way of the garbage can faster than it comes in the front door. 'Through careful management, use of leftovers, and perhaps producing some food, it would be possible to save money that could help the family budget. A Ph. D. Study was made by Marie Geraldine Gage at Cornell University in 1960. She found that unpaid-for services that replace bought goods and hired help can add many dollars to the family's real income. How do _ you _ replace bought goods for services? The one big answer is work — with everyone in the family contributing his share. If you don't have money to buy: A washing machine, you use a plunger, or a washboard and elbow grease; T-bone steaks, you use cheaper sources of protein and more time and effort; Tickets to the World Fair, make your own fair in the back yard; A new dress, make something new from something old; New cupboards for the kitchen, use some packing boxes, a saw, a hammer and nails. 65 JANUARY 1963 The list could be endless, but to summarize: The homemaker who knows the meaning of thrift, who knows how to budget money and keep expenditures within the income, and who knows how to save here and save there, can add many dollars to the family's resources, and, at the same time, she can teach her family how to keep out of the deficit-spending trap. The Latter-day Saint family believes in the old-fashioned virtue of thrift, in making a budget on their own terms, planning the use of resources, keeping out of debt, except for such major expenditures as a home or education, and, in having a nest egg for a rainy day. They are more interested in giving than in getting; they pay their tithes and offerings before thinking of their own material wants. They give their services to the Church and community and send their children to schools and on missions. Through the years, they find themselves on prosperity street, instead of on mortgage row. Questions for Discussion 1. Give concrete examples of ways in which homemakers have been able to add dollars to the family income through care of clothing, the home, and its furnishings. 2. How can we get some production back into the home, not only for saving money, but for personal development? For example: home food production and preservation, clothing construction, and furniture making.

Jacobs (Textbook: America's Literature by James D. Hart and Clarence Gohdes Dryden Press, New York, pp. 512-537) For Third Meeting, April 1963 Objective: devotee. To enjov sharmg Mobvy-Dick, either with the first reader or with the Note: As no study of America's literature would be complete without a consideration of Herman Melville, no study of Melville, the man and literary artist, would be complete without taking into account his masterpiece, Mobv-Dick. As the book Moby-Dick may not be available to all class leaders, this lesson is so planned that it may be presented with sample readings. Those who are able to read the book in its entirety will find it a rewarding experience. URING the nineteenth century, literary America expressed _ its fervor for greatness through its Tennyson and Browning societies; today its devout lovers of life through literature have organized themselves into Thoreau and Melville and Mark 'T'wain societies. Although 'T'wain is popular, Thoreau is deeper, but it is in Melville's Moby-Dick wherein the lone stilly deeps lie, down which those who so desire may plunge to sublime depths of vastness and_ loneliness and awe approached by no other American writer. Yet, for those just learning to swim its serene vastness, who would be terrified at the mere suggestion of ducking their heads beneath the apparent peace of its azure surface cven for an instant, staying on the surface yields immediate delight in humor, excitement, mood, and exotic pleasure. It is with Melville as with Shakespeare — nobody loses. All who come to them will find some hunger satisfied, some image or character sharpened, some horizon pushed back and lowered. In his cynical and unsuccessful novel, The Confidence Man, Melville commented that "It is with fiction as with religion: it should present another world, and yet one to which we feel the tie." In varying degrees we may possess the world which Melville, in MobyDick, created for all who may choose to enter it. 'Though we may feel tied to it so strongly that it seems impossible to break away from its spell, yet that world is strictly Melville's alone, created by his gemius in his quest to know the "unknowable." 67 JANUARY 1963 Sources of Moby-Dick In 1820, the year following Melville's birth, the whaling ship Essex of Nantucket, Massachusetts, with George Pollard, Jr., as captain and Owen Chase as first mate, was rammed and sunk by a spermaceti whale just south of the equator, not far from Tahiti. Fearing cannibals in the unknown Pacific islands, the crew put to sea in three whaleboats for South America some two thousand miles away. During their three months at sea one boat was lost; the crews of the boats led by Pollard and Chase survived after extreme hardship and near starvation. In 1841, while sailing in the same area aboard the whaling vessel the Acushnet, young Melville met Owen Chase, then captain of another whaler, and from his son learned the fated Essex story. About the time he wrote Moby-Dick, Melville made his sole visit to Nantucket where he laid eyes on Captain Pollard, now a night-watchman who had been to sea but once since his rescue. Wrote Melville: To the islanders he was a nobody — to me, the most impressive man, tho' wholly unassuming, even humble, that I ever encountered. In addition, Melville knew the short story "Mocha-Dick, or the White Whale" which was published during his youth. Still, no more startling proof of genius exists than to compare Moby-Dick with these so-called sources. 'The true source is Melville ("Art is not nature') nor is Melville's masterpiece only a mirror reflecting the reality of whaling lore and life. The novel Moby-Dick may be 68 divided into three parts: (1) a long and rather matter-of-fact introduction in which the youth, Ishmael, is forewarned that the whaling voyage on the Pequod will be no ordinary one; (2) the major portion of the book which is a pursuit of the white whale, Moby-Dick, through months of wandering and which includes details of the whaling industry; (3) the final three chapters of exciting conflict, resulting in a battle with the whale and the loss of the ship. The young outcast, Ishmael, alone survives the disaster and tells the story. Plot of Moby-Dick Feeling forlorn and completely the outcast, young Ishmael goes to New Bedford, Massachusetts, to ship aboard a whaling vessel bound for the Pacific. At the overcrowded Spouter Inn, the mischievous inkeeper lodges him with Quequeg, a dark-skinned pagan from the South Seas, who shaves with his harpoon blade and eats almost raw steak for breakfast. Once their mutual fears are vanquished, they become inseparable friends. At Nantucket Harbor they are signed up as crew members of the Pequod. Before they go aboard they are warned by a mysterious eccentric named Elijah to beware of their still unseen captain, Ahab, and of the fanatic savage crew he has smuggled aboard. On Christmas day, their captain still locked in his cabin, the Pequod "blindly plunged like fate into the lone Atlantic, and we settle down to shipboard routine." First mate is Starbuck, cool, moral, conscientious, and the only man aboard ship to oppose Ahab in his determination to wreak vengeance upon Moby-Dick, the white whale, which has "dismasted him" by biting off his leg during a previous whaling voyage. Humorous Stubb and irresponsible Flask are also mates. Harpooners, upon whom the entire success of the whole hunt depends, are Tashtego, an American Indian, Dagoo, a negroid, and Quequeg. And there is Pip the sprightly negro cabin-boy. Representative of the "human scum" which comprised the whaling crews of the day, the Pequod's crew were men from almost every nation, the officers being the only Americans, save for Ishmael. Continuing the Plot When Captain Ahab appears "topside" he places his ivory pegleg in the deck niche cut to receive it, and peers fiercely ahead. 'Then, to the surprise of the crew, he invites them all into "officer country," the quarter deck, and there in pagan fury he works them into a frenzy of hatred for the white whale, Moby-Dick. He plants a_ gold doubloon in the mast, promising it to whoever first sights Moby-Dick. Starbuck now realizes that the hunt for the precious whale-oil from which the best quality candles of the day were made, is for Ahab but a pretense, and that he will sacrifice ship and men, if necessary, in order to kill the albino whale. All the lore of killing whales, cutting the blubber and rendering it into oil in the huge fry-pots fired by burning whale-skin, is explained in detail. And for Melville, most of the objects symbolize some phase of man's relation to the secure land, LESSON DEPARTMENT the treacherous but life-giving sea, to death, disbelief, immortality or human brotherhood. Meanwhile, the first of several "gams" or meetings with other whalers, takes place, each time Ahab calling out his burning question, "Hast seen the White Whale?" 'The passing ship Rachel, hunting for crew members afloat and feared lost, reports having seen Moby-Dick only the day before. Events quicken and intensify as a mysterious "spirit-spout" against the horizon frightens the superstitious crew, and the ship becomes aflame in an electrical storm. The crew bows and _ trembles, while Ahab merely defies fate. Yet for one short moment, he confesses to Starbuck his natural longings for home, wife, and child and that he himself stands aghast at the evil drive which overwhelms him, now against his will. The White Whale is sighted and all give chase. The first day it destroys one of the whale boats. During the second day a member of the crew is killed, Ahab's ivory leg is smashed, and more men are drowned. On the third day MobyDick is harpooned, but Captain Ahab is caught in the line wound around the whale's flank. The infuriated whale sinks the Pequod and all are drowned save for Ishmael, who stays afloat until picked up by the crew of the Rachel that "in her retracing search after her missing children, only found another orphan." The book, although not immediately, was praised sincerely on both shores of the Atlantic: "language in the hands of this master becomes 69 JANUARY 1963 like a magician's wand"; "a unique portrait gallery which every writer must despair of rivaling'; "the gusto of true genius'; "it must be a torpid spirit indeed that is not enlivened with the raciness of his humor and the redolence of his imagination." Yet there were many adverse comments also by those who had not the insight to catch the genius of Melville, nor the will to follow his search for the meanings of good and evil. Melville's Living Language As his friends and family soon learned after his return from his whaling adventures, Melville could "spin a yarn" superbly well. Proof of his skill is abundant throughout Moby-Dick. Read of Ishmael's first encounter with Quequeg ('The Spouter Inn, Chap. 3); Ishmael's awareness of death (The Chapel, Chapter 7, text, page 523); Father Mapple's Sermon (page 525), a superb example of igth century oratory and religious fervor, adapted to the sailor's idiom and mind. Really, the list is well-nigh endless. For zest and power and love of the sea's space and liberty and challenge, consider Melville's sea as described in "The First Lowering" of the whaling boats (Chap. 48). Meanwhile the boats tore on. It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe! 'The vast swells of the omnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled along the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowling-green; the brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would dip for an instant on the kmnife-like edge of the sharper waves, that almost seemed threatening to cut it in two; the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and hollows; the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the 70 "filled with symbols; everyday top of the opposite hill; the headlong, sled-like slide down its other side; — all these, with the cries of the headsmen and harpooners, and the shuddering gasps ~ of the oarsmen, with the wondrous sight of the ivory Pequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails, like a wild hen after her screaming brood — all this was thrilling. For those readers who enjoy clean, pure narration, paragraph after paragraph building up into suspense and power that is without hitch or flaw, read the three days of the chase which concluded the novel. Or if you enjoy reading people into life, then read "Knights and Squires" (Chap. 26-7) which, like "Nantucket" (Chap. 14), glorifies the average democratic man working at his trade in a manner worthy of Whitman. Or read "The Carpenter" (Chap. 107), or "The Blacksmith" (Chap. 112). Any of these readings fulfills itself if read alone; if placed in context, their power, of course, ls greater. Moby-Dick As Symbol From its first page this novel is objects represent concealed truths, or fear of depths beyond themselves, a search for all ultimate yet unknowable answers. 'Thus the search ls life, though it end in death, yet a search possible only on the fluid, unknown mystery, symbolized for Melville by water — by the ocean which encloses most of the globe. His best statement of this important symbol is found at the end of "Brit" (Chap. 58) and deserves quoting. But not only is the sea a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it is also a fiend to its own offspring.... Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle, overlays her own cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks, and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships. No mercy, no power but its own controls it. Panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider, the masterless ocean overruns the globe. Conside: the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures glide under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously hidden beneath the _ loveliest tints of azure. Consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of the most remorseless tribes, as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks. Consider, once more, the wuniversal cannibalism of the sea; all whose creatures prey upon each other, carrying on eternal war since the world began. Consider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most docile earth; consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself: For as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man there lies one insular Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed by all the horrors of the half known life. God keep thee! Push not off from that isle, thou canst never return. But enough of this rhetorical symbolism, so reminiscent of Shakespeare who influenced Melville more than any other writer. In fact, Melville had almost finished the first version of Moby-Dick when he discovered the plays of Shakespeare. As a result of this new insight into the complexities of man and the depths of concealed truth which surround him, much of the novel was rewritten. So much did Hawthorne and Melville have in common that Melville dedicated MobyDick to Hawthorne and _ reading Hawthorne helped Melville discover his own identity. Yet it was ShakeLESSON DEPARTMENT speare who remained the great, single, literary influence of Melville's life. | Dedicated Artist Some of Melville's admirers have maintained that Melville was an untaught, unconscious genius who really had no idea of what, he was doing when he wrote. Yet abundant proof exists that he was a most intense, dedicated artist, so acutely aware of what he hoped to create in his art, that when he felt he had fallen short of his goal, he refused to write trash for cash and so withdrew within his own proud integrity. In the following excerpt, Melville creates in musical language, the image of stillness and peace with a pleasure uniquely his own: It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and moonlight night when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver; and by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery silence, not a solitude; on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow. Lit up by the moon, it looked celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea. Thus he first defines the portentous "Spirit-spout'' which _foretells to all the crew their doom — a doom mirrored later by the ominous birds hovering about and by the inscrutable mysteries now glimpsed in the black waters about the ship. Close to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither before us, while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens. And every morning, perched in our stays, rows of these birds were seen, and in spite of our hootings, for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp, as though they deemed our 71 JANUARY 1963. Ship some drifting, uninhabited craft; a thing appointed to desolation, and therefore fit roosting-place for their homeless selves. And heaved and heaved, still unresistingly heaved the black sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience; and the great mundane soul were in anguish and _ remorse for the long sin and _ suffering it had bred. The New Appraisal An anthology of American literature appearing in 1872 but briefly mentions Melville's name, and then only as the author of Typee and Redburn. His death was scarcely noted even in New York City where he lived out the last twenty years of his martyr-like obscurity. Not until 1919, the centennial of his birth, was any interest whatsoever shown in reviving his reputation. Billy Budd, finished the year of his death, was not even printed until 1924.. Yet when Somerset Maughan's list of the ten greatest novels appeared about 1950, the one American title to be included was that of Moby-Dick. 'This revival of interest in Moby-Dick and the resultant new appraisal of Melville as a literary artist, is one of the most dramatic reversals in all literary history. It is therefore only since World War II that Melville has come fully into his own. Now he is commonly accepted as one of the greatest of writers in the English language, regarded by many as "the most powerful of all the great American writers." In the words of Lewis Mumford, "in depth of experience, and religious insight there is scarcely anyone in the nineteenth century, with the exception of Dostoyevsky, who can be placed beside him." Although not acknowledged by his own in his own day, Herman Melville, writing with epic sweep and tragic vision, "spoke to the ages." Thoughts for Discussion 1. For you what is the major source of Melville's greatness? 2. Is it important to remember that Moby-Dick was written by an American in 1850? Why so? Why not? SOCIAL SCIENCE Divine Law and Church Government The Foundation of Church Government Lesson 6 — Gradation of Divine Law Elder Ariel S. Ballif For Fourth Meeting, April 1963 Objective: To show the wisdom of God in the application of divine law to man. S the title of this lesson indicates, there have been transitional steps or stages in the presentation and development of divine law. 72 While the basic meanings and fundamentals of the law of God have remained constant, how the law has been given and the intensity of the teaching has varied somewhat from dispensation to dispensation. Revealed What Could Be Understood God walked and talked with some of the prophets. To others he communicated through revelation and the visitation of angels. As the growth and development of man occurred, the greater ramifications of the law were presented. Divine Direction Influenced by Man's Willingness to Co-operate During the leadership of Moses the children of Israel were so steeped in the worldly ways of the Egyptians and were so slow to repent, that they were given the carnal law of "an eye for an eye," etc. Finally they were so resistant to righteousness, that the Lord took away the higher Priesthood, leaving them only the enlightenment of the temporal law. 'This seemed to be all they could understand. In the meridian of time Christ, through his personal appearance (testified of by all the prophets), fulfilled the law, restored the Melchizedek Priesthood, and organized his Church. The basis of his government was found in the same divine law that had been revealed to Adam. Only a comparatively small group of his own people accepted him. "At no time since the days of Adam, had the Gospel been so fully taught and made so simply clear to the understanding as in the days of Jesus" (WupTsoE, JOHN A.: Rational Theology 4th ed., page 57). Within a few generations, through apostasy, the Priesthood and Church government were taken from the earth. "... Darkness covereth the LESSON DEPARTMENT earth, and gross darkness the minds of the people, and all flesh has become corrupt before my face" (D & C 112:23). In the dispensation of the fulness of times, the Lord has. Restored every right, key, power, and authority that had ever been given to help man realize the full purpose of his creation. Dr. Widtsoe, referring to this period of time, writes: Finally, as men broke through the darkness, as intelligence became diffused among all men, and liberality of thought grew and became respected, the Gospel was restored with the authority of the Priesthood and the organization of the Church (Wiptsor, Joun A.: Priesthood and Church Government, page 25). Divine Law Gives Direction and Incentive to All Men Since the days of Adam and his children the Lord has directed his servants to teach all the people of the mission of Jesus Christ and its saving power through repentance and baptism, in order that all mankind can enjoy the blessings of heaven and the promises of God. This directive to call all men to repentance was repeated with emphasis through each of the prophets. In Adam's day "... The Lord God called upon men by the Holy Ghost everywhere and commanded them that they should repent' (Moses 5:14). All who repented received the blessings; the progress of those who did not was stopped. Before the flood, Noah, an ordained prophet, "... Called upon the children of men that they should repent" (Moses 8:20). The Lord told Abraham that his seed "shall bear this. Ministry and Priesthood unto all nations" (Abraham 2:9). Christ sent his apostles to all 73 JANUARY 1963 the world, and John the Revelator declared the gospel would be preached to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. (See Rev. 14:6-7; see also D & C 133:37-38.) The Separation of the Children of God As we examine the record of man in the holy scripture, we are impressed with the fact that comparatively few of the children of men followed the direction set forth in divine law. Adam's rebellious children were shut out of the presence of the Lord and "... Dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden" (Moses 5:41). The descendants of Noah were scattered "abroad upon the face of all the earth" (Genesis 11:9). Through Abraham's righteousness and prayers, he being of the direct lineage of Adam through the prophets, the Lord preserved his life and led him and his family out of the land of the idolaters to a place where they could preserve the lineage through which the Savior of mankind would come. From dispensation to dispensation the nonbelievers in the world increased, until idolaters, pagans, and other nonbelievers in the divine mission of Christ, constituted the masses of mankind. Secular records reveal men in early times as individuals ruled by force and organized primarily to resist invasion and destruction or to extend their power over others by the application of force. Through trial and error, investigation, and experimentation; through the use of his intellect and by the processes of reason and reflective thinking; and through the grace of 74 God and the Spirit that "giveth light to every man that cometh into the world" (D & C 84:46), men have accumulated culture and slowly and painfully improved their status to a present level of achievement. Man's development through the use of his intelligence is but a reflection of the divinity of his origin. The record of man's cultural development is closely connected with the development of weapons of destruction. 'The rise of great nations indicates a combination of intellectual achievement and the application of inventive genius to the production of effective weapons of war. It likewise indicates a lack of understanding of the divine purpose in the creation of man. Today, man is reaching the climax of the development of his destructive power. There now exists the physical power through man's knowledge to destroy our Civilization. It should be clearly understood that in contrast to the evidence of force indicated in the secular record as so important in man's de velopment, the religious records place the emphasis upon love and understanding as having a more direct correlation with intelligent growth and development. Love was and is the basic motivation in the plan of life and salvation as presented by Jesus Christ. It is the only power known to man by which peace may be established in the hearts of men. Divine Direction Makes Man Reach Up — Godhead A child normally inherits the characteristics of the parents. To be the spirit child of God and created physically in his image, provides the important idea that the progress of man is limited only by his ambition and personal application. Certainly his relationship to Deity provides perfection for his ideal. To have a goal is the first essential to progress. With our Father in heaven as the ideal of man, the natural effect is to lift man up. 'To understand this concept, however, man must be in tune with the spirit of the Creator. This will come in the recognition of and adherence to the divine law, testified to by the Holy Ghost and administered under the direction of the Priesthood. When God created man and placed him on earth with the admonition to subdue the earth and have dominion over it, the seeds of discontent were sown. 'The admonition meant for man to know all about the earth and its contents — examining its make-up, learning its secrets, and putting to use its latent powers for the benefit and welfare of mankind. "By the sweat of thy brow" did not mean to labor forever by hand. It was the challenge for man to use his physical, mental, and spiritual capacities to find out the unknown. He was to find the answer to every perplexity with which he was presented in satisfying human needs and, in the process, subduing the earth and gaining dominion over every living thing. We are told that light and truth are eternal (see D & C 84:44-46) and, by the processes of reflective thinking and reasoning, man can discover light and truth. Through invention, or finding the various uses and applications for the discoveries made, he expands his knowlLESSON DEPARTMENT edge and applies the information to beneficial use. Thus man moves in progress toward his ideal. Divine Principles of Progress Applied to Man The divine law places the responsibility for growth, development, and eventual exaltation upon each individual. But the Lord has provided man with adequate instruction graded to suit his experience and development and has made available to him inspiration and revelation. The Law of Choice There is a law eternal in nature that assures man the privilege of choice. "The Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself.... Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh" (2 Nephi 2:16, 27). 'This includes two very closely related conditions — the opportunity for election and the responsibiliy of performance. Man, really to enjoy the benefit of his freedom of choice, must know the law. To receive the blessings promised by the law, he must, of his own free will and choice, carry out the requirements of the law, the decision to be made on the basis of his conviction that it is right. 'True virtue is knowing the good and the bad and choosing the good. This World Is a Training Ground With nght of choice and the availability of divine guidance, man is charged with the responsibility of performance equal to the opportunity presented to him. Freedom of choice means nothing without opposition. "For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all 75 JANUARY 1963 things. If not so righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad..." (2 Nephi 2:11). Man, through experience, including prayer, learns to understand his relationship to God and _ his creations. Being a child of God spiritually, man has the divine spark that causes him to reach up to and cry out for divine guidance. Man's life span generally provides the time and opportunity for intellectual and spiritual development equal to inherited capacity. Self-discipline in bringing one's appetites and desires in line with unselfish consideration of others in all human relations is a major part of this world's training. Due to man's ability to transmit culture from generation to generation, it is possible to build upon the experience of the past. In this sense each generation stands on the shoulders of the generation that preceded it. The progress of the new generation is measured in terms of the expansion of its cultural heritage. In review, then, this training ground gives us an opportumity to develop spiritually, temporally, and intellectually. It is for the purpose of finding out what man will do with his opportunities and abilities. For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And _inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward. But he _ that doeth not anything until he is commanded, and receiveth a commandment with doubtful heart, and keepeth it with slothfulness, the same is damned (D & C 58:28-29). 76 Work Is Basic to Progress When the "first family" was given the assignment to subdue the earth, it had reference to hard, physical work. The Lord said "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread" (Genesis 3:19). Adam was to overcome the weeds and thistles in order to live. He had to work with his hands and use his ability to solve problems. This involved thinking, reasoning, faith, and inspiration. In modern scripture the Lord says that the idler has no place among his people. "Thou shalt not be idle; for he that is idle shall not eat the bread nor wear the garments of the laborer" (D & C 42:42). The scriptures indicate that God ordained work as essential to exaltation. From the scriptures we glean that doing is important. In fact, it is what you do about what you know that really counts. "Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, decelving your own selves" (James 1:22). The divine directions given for exaltation involve a constant quest for enlightenment. Growth is as much a spiritual and intellectual law as a physical law. 'There is no growth, development, or enlightenment without energy and _ effort expended. To subdue the earth has meant a constant struggle to discover the elements and their uses for the benefit of man. "To subdue the earth" has also an intellectual implication, for the Prophet Joseph Smith said, "It ls impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance" (D & C 131:6). Spiritually the challenge is the same. "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth" (D & C 93:36). From the above, it could be implied that man is saved no faster than he gains knowledge of the earth (material things), of life (human relations), and of God. 'This cannot all be attained at once, but is made available as we are able to understand. "Behold, ye are little children and ye cannot bear all things now; ye must grow in grace and in the knowledge of the truth" (D&C 50:40). The Fulness of Times The fulness of times has a dual meaning. Religiously we see its meaning in the fulness of the gospel plan. In addition, the light that lighteth all men who come into this world has been expressed in the temporal progress that has been made. Each dispensation has had men with creative power who have added valuable discoveries to man's knowledge that have assisted in his cultural advancement. 'Today, we are privileged to enjoy the concentration of all the rules of life with their explanation that the Lord has ever given to his children. We have the greatest collection of usable facts and information that the human race has ever accumulated. Out of this accumulation, discovery and invention have been greatly increased. 'There seems to be no end to the expansion of knowledge. This development, together with the restoration of the fulness of the gospel and the functioning of the Priesthood in Church organization, has assured mankind of his destiny according to the design of the Creator.

'The means of communication and transportation make possible more effective understanding among all peoples. The powers of production are great enough to meet the needs of man if used productively. There is a veritable avalanche of brilliant ideas coming from all parts of the world. The real lag is found in human relations and understanding. This is the mission of the gospel of Jesus Christ. If the gospel message can reach the hearts of all men the proper motivation can then direct inspired men to open the way for the kingdom of God on earth. Thoughts for Discussion 1. Does divine law apply with the same force to all men everywhere at all times? Explain. 2. What is the difference between the Priesthood of Aaron and the Melchizedek Priesthood? 3. Why was the Melchizedek Priesthood taken from the children of Israel?. What do you understand by the quotation "and the Spirit giveth light to every man that cometh into the world"? 5. It is obvious that we live in a greatly advanced civilization. Will the Lord expect a greater degree of perfection from his saints today than from saints of a former dispensation? Justify your answer. REFERENCES The Book of Mormon 2 Nephi 4 Nephi The Doctrine and Covenants Sections 42, 58, 84, 93 Wiptsor, Joun A.: Priesthood and Church Government, Chapter 1 The Fog Linnie F.
