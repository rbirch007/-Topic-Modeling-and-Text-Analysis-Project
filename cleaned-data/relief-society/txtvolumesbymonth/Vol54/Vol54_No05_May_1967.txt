WELL OF PEACE
Peggy Tangren
I know where I will take you when I see
weariness engraved upon your face.
I will lead you to the willow,
and I will pillow
you upon the peace I found
beneath the cover of that timeless tree.
I will give you moonlight on the beaver pond,
rthe miracle of treetop, cloud, and star
laid at your feet�reflected where you are.
Listening from the bank,
You will understand why deer and cougar drink
in amity.
Trusting our stillness, a beaver will cleave his lake
from hutch to shore,
leaving liquid beauty in his wake.
A well of peace.
We can sound its depth, and from it mold a plan
for our fulfillment�our contented place.
This is where I will take you when I see
a plea for answers on your face.

These Things Alice Colton Smith Assistant Professor of Sociology, Utah State University, Logan, Utah Hndure Memher, General Board of Relief Society � The afternoon sun was mellow hot. Its warmth sent waves of pleasure down my back and bathed the whole world in wellbeing. The horse tossed his head impatiently for a moment and sent the flies buzzing. Then, he returned to cropping the early grass on the ditch bank. I was suspended in a sensation of perfect, low-keyed happiness. There I was on such a perfect, late spring afternoon listening to the two women I loved best, my grandmother and my mother. I wanted time to stand still. My grandmother, her gray hair in a knot on top of her head, 324 sat in her buggy while my mother and I leaned on the garden gate. Although I was not yet eight, I stored in the never-to-be-forgotten area of memory in my brain, those things about which they spoke. "You are an angel of mercy," my mother said. I looked up. Grandmother's face was wrinkled and her hands were rough from hard work. She an angel? "Oh, pshaw," she said modestly, but at the same time smiled with pleasure. Silently, I had agreed with my mother. I couldn't imagine an angel more beautiful. Enraptured, I followed the story of heroism that my grand- _ mother unfolded. She would not become famous and_ world-renowned because of it, but it lodged unforgettably in one'small girl's heart. Illness in the middle � of the night, a knock at the door in the early morn before the cock crowed, a plea of anguish, a horse and buggy hitched together by lantern light, a ride through the wind and sleet, the soothing voice of hope and rescue, the calming presence�an angel of mercy in a land without hospitals and doctors. There followed tales of babies delivered, of feverish children nursed to health, and of sad times when old friends were laid to rest. This pattern of compassion was etched into my soul that faraway afternoon. Except for that one sentence of commendation, there were no more words of praise given, I think, or expected. The experiences were told as concern for friends and neighbors, what anyone would do under similar circumstances. She loved those people, and they loved her. Was there more to be said? For in my life, as my mother often remembered her crippled, nearly bedfast, unmarried friend and always sent her a Christmas dinner; or asked us each fall, as school started, to share our clothes with those less fortunate, the early lesson was reinforced. I do not remember any formal lessons given about the fact that all men are brothers, that each one is his brother's keeper, but I knew about love at an early age, about love and love of one's fellow men. It was a way of life. Then, I married into a family whose mother had taken into her These Things Endure home the homeless, the sick, and the dying, the orphan, thirty-four of them, to nurture, to feed, to clothe, many of them during the depression when bills for food alarmingly mounted, but there _were no complaints from the man and woman who understood what Jesus meant by the brotherhood of man, the relatedness of all human beings to one another. - Unforgettably, indelibly, quietly, and, informally, the women in my life taught me the values and attitudes of the gospel. Men are dying on the battlefield, as I write this, in the agony we call war. There has always been war, or nearly always, if we understand history correctly. Only now more men die than before, more men, women, and children. I have seen tragic poverty in the streets of America, Europe, and in the cities and towns of the Middle East. There has always been poverty, only now astronomical numbers of people are starving and under-privileged. We must cope with problems whose size, enormity, and complexity stagger us. Each day the news reports are full of tales of need, disaster, terror, and horror. Are we becoming deaf to these because we feel helpless; even hopeless, at the size of the world's problems? Did not the Prophet Joseph Smith suggest a reasonable, realistic way to meet these problems of human need when he said, "Let your labors be mostly confined to those around you, in the circle of your own acquaintance"? (DHC IV, page 607). What would happen if all the women of the world followed the teachings of the Prophet of God? There would be 325 May 1967 no poor whose needs were unattended, no lonely, confused, or angry strangers, no listressed of whom care was not taken, no widows in want of food or friendship, nor any orphans who wept. When the Prophet gave his advice, did he mean that we should not be concerned for the ills of distant people? I do not believe this. I think he was teaching us a great lesson in concern. It is easy to write a check (hard as it may be to part with our money and send it off so that someone else may exercise care), easier than to take the time out of our busy lives to be thoughtful and concerned for the well-being of those around us. There live in my neighborhood the aged, the sick, widows, the newly orphaned, the distressed, people who are lonely and unhappy, one of whom recently talked of suicide. Strangers also live on my street. Should I not reorganize my life to take care of these first? Everwidening circles of compassionate care could encompass the whole earth. L cannot remember a time when training in music, acquiring outdoor and indoor skills, and learning the joys of reading were not a part of our home. We read as we breathed, naturally, joyfully. To learn was to live. My father read, my mother read, my brother and sisters read, every age was concerned with study and development. Eight or eighty, God had given us a huge program, and part of life was this exciting world of study. It was not until I was past twenty that I realized our home was different in one vital respect. 326 It was our custom to sit at the dinner table an hour or two after dinner 'was finished to talk about the day. Here, Father took the time to tell his young children about what was happening in the Congress of the United States of which he was a member. The politics of the day became vividly real in those sessions, where one could speak his mind freely, asking questions, probing all aspects of life. Here the meanings of the gospel of Jesus Christ were spiritedly discussed and _ their practical applications mulled over. All the world was here for discussion and always related back to our most special concern, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints. What a compliment my father and mother paid us as they listened to our opinions as those of valued peers, discussing points of interest with the same passionate concern and courtesy that they did with their most trusted friends. How naturally and informally the gospel was taught to us, as a part of life� not something to be paraded on special occasions and having little relevance to what we did every day. Nearly every night was home night. Consciously or unconsciously, my mother and father were trying to bring up their children 'in light and truth" (D&C 93: 40). The role of the mother to teach, to share, to be with, to love her children has always been a part of my mother's life, whether her children were one or fortyone. So, mother flew thousands of miles to visit me and my family when, for one wonderful year, we lived in the land of the Savior. She came so that we might walk together in Gethsemane, glean as Ruth had done in the fields of Boaz, walk the streets of Jerusalem to Calvary, stand on the Mount of Olives, and be together in the land we both learned to love, as she had read the Bible to the family while we sat around the pot-bellied stove on snowy nights when my world was young. On hot, midsummer day as we drove north, the wind from the east dried everything in its path. The brittle weeds rasped against each other. The hills, hazy in the distance, were burned and barren. Our car topped the hill. Below us, harp-shaped and of the deepest blue, lying in its part of the giant cleft that reaches deep into Africa, was the lake about which we had read and dreamed all our lives, Galilee. We were unprepared for the barren world in which it lay, 686 feet below sea level, and for the searing heat. What we were prepared for was the blue, the unbelievable blue of this inland lake called the Sea of Galilee. One of the earliest songs we had sung around our piano was "Galilee, blue Galilee where Jesus loved so much to be." We knew why. Instantly, our hearts and experiences were linked with his in love of this beautiful spot. As we stood, side by side, on the shores of that hallowed sea, my mother and I, I was grateful for the woman who had taught me to love the Lord, who had read to me as a little child the stories of Jesus and his disciples as they fished in these blue waters, of Jesus who walked upon the waves, and of Peter who momentarily faltered, of Jesus feeding the multitudes on one of the These Things Endure hills surrounding Galilee, and of Jesus, after his resurrection, sitting on these very shores so long ago�or was it yesterday?�loving this world and its people, as he told Peter to feed his sheep. Now, together we stood, mother and daughter, teacher and pupil, remembering our Lord, sharing as grown women the miracle of his life, so much of which had been lived by this sea. We live, all of us, in a mobile world. We live in a world of swift change. In the past families sank roots in one part of the world. These roots were an anchor, Now, we move from city to city, from continent to continent. What will bind us together, give us the stability of the past, while helping us to live in the freedom of the present? Can deeply shared experiences, coupled with the love of God and man, help mothers to build into their children a firm testimony and an understanding that will be the deepest root of all? God, as he said in the Doctrine and Covenants that he would, has poured out his spirit on all flesh. One mind can comprehend but a small fraction of what is known. In one brief century, man has escaped his earthbound past. For the first time in history we live only hours from the Sea of Galilee, from India, Argentina, New Zealand. What happens today in Australia affects my world. Tonight, via television, I am with my neighbor's son in Viet Nam. Under the influence of God, suddenly all men are truly neighbors. Moreover, increasingly, we live in cities, away from our kin, where there are not only opportunities for growth, but where 327 May 1967 there are, also, much loneliness and unfriendliness. Family life undergoes great changes. More and more women work. Fathers commute long distances to work, and mothers who stay at home find that they become the primary teachers and disciplinarians of the children. Men and women create new patterns of husband and wife relationships. As man's technology grows, much drudgery of the past vanishes. There is time for creativity and learning as there has never been before. As our world shrinks, our universe expands. We must devise new methods of relating to and loving one another. If we are close to our Father in heaven, new ways of living will emerge, new patterns of family life develop. It will be exciting and satisfying as we find new ways to teach our children the gospel of understanding, love, and compassion. My mother is eighty-eight. The vigorous pace she set in the streets of Jerusalem is no longer possible as she walks with her cane. My grandmother is long dead. Yet amid all that is new, there remains the child at the mother's knee learning the history of God's teaching of man and the enduring values. Mother and grandmother still teach the child the compassion for all men that will some day link us together in love. The mother helps to open the doors for the child that lead to the love of learning. These endure no matter how fast and how great the change. There will always be mothers and grandmothers to help each generation find God. (� THE GREATEST OF THESE The depth of thought that we attain, The wisdom of our searching here, The knowledge that we win by faith Are treasures life will hold most dear. The sage who works with questing mind, The brush that paints to please the eye, The poet's meter, word, and rhyme, These are gifts the heart holds high. Yet these are signs along the way That all our gifts are heaven's cost, That learning truth, we learn to love The poor, the lonely, and the lost. To give the hungry more than bread, To ransom captives from their chain, For painter, poet, and the sage These are treasure, gift, and gain. @ Carolle Denton ~ 328 Literary Contest Announcements 1966 The Relief Society Poem Contest and the Relief Society Short Story Contest are conducted annually bythe General Board of Relief Society to stimulate creative writing among Latter-day Saint women and to encourage high standards of work.

Walch Member, General Board of Relief Society Sister Anderson was just finishing her spring cleaning. What pleasure she felt as she observed the dust-free walls, freshly waxed floors, shiny furniture, shampooed rugs, and the sparkling windows with their clean curtains. Housecleaning was not the task it had once been when the home was full of little tots with fingers just made to leave spots on windows and furniture, and to draw pictures on walls. Neither was it the same that it had been when these little tots had grown older with their rooms filled with precious collections, making it difficult, at certain ages, even to make your way into their rooms. Jeff was the one who had really made cleaning a problem. She smiled as she stood in the doorway of the room that had once been his and observed its empty orderliness. The room seemed lonely. Perhaps it missed 332 the pictures of Indians, cowboys, and baseball players that had shared space on the walls with pennants from all parts of the country. She remembered airplanes hanging from the ceiling and the dresser drawers stuffed with rock collections, stamp collections, coin collections, and other precious treasures, making it necessary for his clothing to be shoved into the little space that was left. She remembered, too, the times they had tolerated his other interests. The guppies, the turtles, and the goldfish had not been so bad, but she would never forget the year of the white mice! Jeff had not been like the others who outgrew one interest as he grew into another. His just kept multiplying and being added to until his room became a combination of a museum and a zoo. Yes, housecleaning Jeff's room had been a challenge, but one she had always had the courage to face. And with his help and with many compromises, they had usually reached some degree of order. These memories caused Sister Anderson some concern. What had happened to her courage? Why was it she now had one drawer in her immaculate home that was always passed by and left in its happy, cluttered state of confusion? Sister Anderson knew the answer. It was because she was afraid�afraid of memories. For years she had been putting precious things into this huge drawer and murmuring, "Someday Ill go through and organize those things into scrapbooks for the children." Even though her family all had homes of their own, they were still "her children." And she was their mother who had faced the white mice. Surely she could show this same courage now! One morning she took the drawer, emptied its contents onto a big table, and sat down to the task she had been evading. What a day she had! It was not just one of sad memories. True, there were a few tears shed, but, frequently, she could be heard to chuckle as she wiped the tears away. She was amazed at the things she had saved. (Could Jeff have taken after her side of the family?) Most of them reached into the past, but there was one very special memory that also brought thoughts of the present and even the future. It was such a little thing. Just a small piece of notebook paper folded in the center to make it look like a program. On the outside, written in the little-boy A Woman Alone and Home Evening printing of one of the children, it And on the inside PRAYER ~ By JEFF FAMILY COUNCIL ~ CADDY a' TORIES-GRANDMA Srory - DAO MUSIC -By MIKE PRAYER-BY JOHN EATS - WE HOPE - sy MoM How wise her dear husband had been in feeling concern about the training of their children. His work had taken him away from them much of the time, and he felt the need of an anchor to hold his family close to each other and to the Church. He remembered the promise given in 1915 to parents who would be faithful in holding Home Evenings. President Joseph F. Smith had said, "Tf the saints obey this counsel, we promise that great blessings will result. Love at home and obedience to parents will increase. Faith will be developed in the hearts of the youth of Israel, and they will gain power to combat the evil influences and temptations that beset them." Precious experiences had fol- - lowed that first Home Evening. She was grateful that her husband had lived long enough to see the promise fulfilled. Surely, love and obedience at home had increased. Faith had developed, and they had been able to combat the evil influences and temptations that had faced them all as they reared their family in a non-Latter-day Saint community. Perhaps the quality of their printed program had improved 333 May 1967 over the years, but nothing could improve the sweet spirit she had felt as they knelt together in their first Home Evening and heard their little son ask the Lord's blessings to be with them that they might "have a happy time together and be good boys." And they had surely been "good boys,"' with the wisdom to select "good girls" for companions, and they were all rearing '"'good children," and being helped through the wonderful Home Evening programs so prayerfully and carefully prepared for all Latter-day Saint families�not just for families with children. Sister Anderson knew: 1. That a woman living alone is a family. 2. That the Home Evening lessons can help her to put God's laws into operation in her everyday living. 3. That all adults in the Church can be helped if they will study the lessons, because none of us is perfect and all should be striving to become better. 4. That the manual suggests that adults concentrate on the assignment each week and see their own spiritual growth. 5. That some adults living alone enjoy studying by themselves. 6. That some find it stimulating to meet in small groups, with others in the neighborhood. 7. That those blessed with children living near may want to meet with them occasionally. 8. That all should follow the counsel of the Church ieaders�be in tune with and a part of the great world-wide program of a weekly Home Evening. 9. That the time to begin is now. 10. That peace and contentment will increase in the lives of those living alone who will follow the counsel of the prophet and set an example for others. Someone has said, ''Don't look back, things are gaining on you." Sister Anderson was glad that she had spent that day looking back, but now it was time to put away her memories and turn her attention to the present, for tonight was her Home Evening. In a flash she recalled the chocolate dessert in the refrigerator she had prepared. She looked over toward her comfortable chair with the Family Home Evening Manual, a sharpened pencil, the scriptures, and a hymn book all at hand, with a scratch pad, all waiting for her opening prayer a and study to begin. MOTHER'S DAY Downy soft, and cuddly, blue as a baby's eyes; She turns the bootee gently and breathes a longing sigh. Under the folds of tissue the other bootee lies, Wetted once by scalding tears�now lovingly tucked away. One withered, faded rosebud, once pink as a baby's toes, Folded into the tissue with the dreams a mother knows. Yesterday is not forgotten, but softened through the years; The wings of love beat steadily and hope replaces tears. She sees him in the sunrise and in the budding rose; She hears him in the lark's song, while in her heart she knows That while she labors here with common things He dwells with prophets, priests, and kings And waits for her to come. @ Patricia A. Lamb gy 334 � Grandma Frankum watched the appliance man drive up to her place and park in front of the house. He must be checking the house number, she thought.

The automatic washer is from all of us. It is to lighten your burden, and make life worthwhile. With love from all your children. Grandma Frankum shrugged her shoulders. To the man at the door she said: "Bring it in. You have your job to do, same as anyone else." "Thank you, Ma'am." The delivery man connected the washer with both hot and cold water, as well as the septic tank. He worked rapidly and efficiently.: "It's all ready for use, Ma'am. Here is a book of directions." Then with a smile, "Your family must love you very much, Mrs. Frankum." 335 May 1967 "Yes. Yes. I'm sure they do." "Now I can take your conventional washer off your hands, and when I sell it, I'll send you the cash." "No! No! Just let it sit there as it is, thank you. And good day to you, Sir." The delivery man was gone. Grandma Frankum dropped on a stool she had in the utility room. She read the card again. Complete automation will be the downfall of the human race, she thought. And who is carrying a burden? And if you ask me, life's been worth living since the day God placed Adam and Eve in the garden. That is, if a body's a mind to make it so. And who needs an automatic washer? Not I, that's for sure. Granpma Frankum looked from the new automatic washer to her much used conventional type. "As far as I'm concerned, my washer is plenty up-to-date. Anybody who has been around in this old world as long as I, knows how easy it is to wash these days." As she sat on the stool, Grandma Frankum started traveling on memory trails. "Winnie girl, come help your old Grandma with the clothes baskets. We'll go down to the river and get the washing done." Winnie Kimport had planned to lie on the grass and braid clover blossoms, and just watch the cloud patterns in the blue, blue sky. But her lazy, lovely plans just never worked out. Children were made to fetch and carry, and today was the day to help Grandma Kimport with the washing at the river. "It's only a jump and a step 336 to the river,' Grandma said encouragingly. Winnie, following closely at her heels, counted the steps. There were one thousand nine hundred and three good-sized steps to the river. Winnie's job was largely to fetch and carry. Grandma Kimport took pains with her wash, and her red, bleeding knuckles were proof of it. That they healed from one wash to another was a sheer miracle. When each article was whiter than white, she wrung it out and handed it to Winnie to spread on the rocks by the river bank. A second memory trail led to the many days Winnie helped her mother on washday. It was summer, and the wash could be done outside, which kept the house cool and free from washday steam. The water had to be hauled from the spring, and heated over an open fire in a large caldron. Mother's homemade soap gave forth a lye odor as it bubbled over and through the clothes. Winnie's job was to stir the clothes as they boiled, and, occasionally, raise them high out of the water to inspect the cleanness of the product. Winnie's mother, also, took pride in her wash, and when the clothes were whiter than white, they were dipped out of the boiling water, rinsed in three different cold waters, and hung on the line to dry. One day the clothesline broke. The clothes then had to be gathered from the dusty, dirty ground and redone. It wouldn't have been so bad, but the water from the wash was all poured out. They had had to start hauling water again, and gathering chips for a fire. Summer washdays were' pleasanter than winter even so. In winter, clothes hung on lines from door to door. To walk from room to room was a duck-and-dive process. Then, too, the steam from the drying clothes formed moisture on the windows, which froze solid. A memory trail led Winnifred Frankum to the glorious day in the Kimport family when Papa brought a gas engine home. Its main purpose was to pump the water from the well. But Papa figured out a belt system in which the gas engine could be used to run the washer, both the agitator and the wringer. This device had changed their lives completely. "Mama, Winnie is a big girl now, and IJ'll leave Burt to help her and they can do the wash for you. That way you can stay in and care for the little ones and get dinner." Papa turned directly to Winnie, and asked: ''Winnie, you do know how to wash, don't you?" "Yes, Papa." Winnie knew how to wash. As long as she could remember she had been helping with the wash. Second-in-command, you might say. Now she was being promoted, commander-in-chief. The gas engine and the belt were a trial, but even so, the Kimports had it lots nicer than most of their neighbors who had to run the agitator and wringer by hand. "Yes, this is the day of automation,' Grandma Frankum washdays, � Automation said, as she gazed at her new 1967 automatic washer that had just been delivered to her door. __She continued to speak aloud, "T never thought I would live to see the day I had everything I wanted and then some. I don't need this washer anymore than I need a throne to sit on. And if I were of a mind to start using it, I'd be sitting in my living room on a rocking chair throne. I belong out here minding my wash. And what if the automatic doesn't get my clothes whiter than white? Land sakes, my mother and grandmother would turn over in their graves. "The method which I use is to run all the batches through the same water. The automatic method is to run several batches of water through one batch of clothes. It stands to reason a lot more water would be used." Grandma Frankum rubbed her back, as she thought of carrying all that water in buckets from the spring. I calculate the difference in water used in the two methods would do a lot of yard beautification, she thought. An idea popped into Grandma Frankum's head. She must call Seth. Seth was the handyman, the gardener, the caretaker. Seth was handier than a shirt pocket. "Seth, I want you to plant lawn, lots of it, clear down to and through the willow and quaking aspen grove. And while the lawn is growing I want you to build picnic tables and benches. I want them all painted green, my favorite color. A dark forest green, that is. I want enough tables and benches so that my whole family, even down 337 May 1967 to the fourth generation, can sit down and eat together." "Yes, Ma'am!"' No sooner was Seth given a job than he bit his teeth into it. When summer came hot and dry, Grandma Frankum had lawn that was lush and lovely, because she hadn't wasted a mite of water while she was using the automatic washer. She smiled happily as she walked to the grove and saw the fine picnic tables all ready and waiting. The shade was just right, enough to shield a person from the hot rays of the sun, and not dense enough to be chilly. "My family will have a reunion to remember. I can hardly wait for the day." Now the big day Grandma Frankum had looked forward to had arrived�the family reunion. Grandma Frankum's family came from far and near. Sux counted her posterity. There were seven children, four daughters and three sons, and doubling that with marriage made fourteen. There were thirty-one grandchildren, and all but four were married, which made fifty-eight of the third generation. The fourth generation al-. Ready numbered twenty-two little folks, and there were good prospects for more.... God had said to multiply and replenish the earth. Grandma Frankum was proud of her posterity. They were all physically well, spiritually sound, and financially progressive. But her granddaughter Karen and her husband John Wilcox had had some setbacks and were 338 struggling to keep their heads above water. Yet they were too independent and proud to accept help of any kind. Now the huge family were gathering at the picnic tables. The family had brought foods of all kinds, and Grandma Frankum had cooked up many surprises. The tables were overburdened with delicious edibles. "You'll have to stay for three days to consume this _ food," Grandma Frankum laughed hospitably. There was much visiting and songs sung and musical numbers rendered and recitations by the little folks. The day was perfect for everyone. Then Grandma Frankum announced: "It's time for the drawing." "The drawing?' family queried. "Yes, my dears. You sweet generous children gave me a lovely automatic washer. I do appreciate your thoughtfulness. But it is entirely too modern for the entire Grandma." "I beg to differ, Mother. I haven't seen anything you could not operate yet." Jerry Frankum was the youngest of her children. "We agree,' they all said. "Why I haven't even cared to try it out. J] like my dear conventional washer so much. And when I get too old to operate it, I plan to have laundry service. So don't feel hurt. Now, all in fun, I've put slips of paper in the box, and we'll draw a name for the automatic washer. All right?" "All right!" they all chorused after a doubtful pause. Inwardly, Grandma was happy that they were entering into her game so splendidly. She held up a box and waited for the laughter to subside. "To make this official, we'll ~ have the littlest tot who is capable, be the one to draw a name from the box. Any volunteers from the little folks?" "I'm big, Great-grandma." Grandma Frankum_ unfolded the slip and glanced at the name. "The name on the slip is." She waited for complete silence. "The name is Karen Wilcox." There followed a round of cheering, and a wave of congeratulations to Karen and John. Karen was coming up now. She put her arms around Grandma Frankum, and through tears, said: "Oh, Grandmother, this is the first time in my life that I've been lucky." "Why, Child, you've' been lucky since the day you were born. And when I think about it, you were lucky when you lived with the Father in the spirit world, but we won't go into that. I'm glad you got the washer." The young men helped John Automation load the washer into his old station wagon. Then, as the shadows of late afternoon threaded through the willow and aspen trees, the clan started wending their ways homeward. At last Grandma Frankum was alone in the house again. It had been a successful day. Everyone had had a good time. I believe my little gift-giving idea went off real well, she thought. It takes a lot of diplomacy and tact to accept presents and dispense gifts. And I believe I made a ringer today. Now, there is one little item that I must do before the day closes. I must destroy the names in the drawing box. Grandma Frankum went over to the fireplace. It was too hot for a fire, but a little scrap of paper fire wouldn't heat the house. She turned the box upside down and one by one the folded slips of paper fell into the flame. Grandma Frankum laughed happily, as she saw in her own handwriting, each slip bearing r Now AND NOW IT IS MAY And now it is May, the winter seeds awaken In riotous bloom after the long, long night; Under trees of apricot, the shaken Blossoms spread a carpet, petal-white. The breezes, dewy soft with April's showers, Whisper, ''The growing season has begun, now," they whisper, "'in these fragrant hours, Bring out your dreams; re-dream them one by one." May is the month of promise, of believing; All that was hoped for can become in May; See how the peonies' red points are cleaving Damp earth and mulch and musty leaves away; May is a month of surety, of knowing Life is an always becoming, and ever-growing.

Anderson � The book said walking was good for her condition, so Evelyn made daily excursions somewhere: to the grocery store for nonfattening specials, downtown for window shopping, over to Connie's for consoling words, or to the park, for herself. Now, five days past the due date, she felt she would be happiest at the park. She had kissed Don goodbye, sending him off to work with the half-hearted promise that she would call him if anything happened. The breakfast dishes had been done, and the house inspected. Convinced that everything was ready for her mother's arrival, Evelyn tied a blue scarf about her hair and reached for the umbrella. When she opened the door, April came filtering through the screen: the patter, the moisture, the peace of spring rain. Evelyn moved cautiously up the stairs of the basement apartment and started down the wet sidewalk. Her senses were alert, as they had always seemed to be during the past nine months. Today, the air was clean with the fragrance of rain and lilacs; a breeze gently moved the lacy green limbs that reached longingly toward the gray sky. When Evelyn turned the corner and began the last two-block stretch 341 May 1967 toward the park, an old woman appeared in the doorway of a small white house and shook a braided rug jerkily. Evelyn could feel the tired eyes upon her, and, suddenly, became conscious of herself as someone else saw her. She smiled toward the house and hurried on. At length, she moved gratefully under the arched gate of the park and into the refuge of the high, trimmed hedges, the flower gardens, and the trees. Little girls were _ sloshing through the puddles that had collected on the sidewalks. Boys, undaunted by the shower, were skipping rocks across the pond. Evelyn looked at the children and thought that soon she would be the mother of one. It would be a boy, of course, because Don said it would. All these months she had looked at little boys, like the blonde tossing the boomerang and jumping back so as not to be hit; or like the one squeaking in his rubber coat down the not-so-slippery slide. A little boy who looks like Don, she thought, a little boy to teach and to love. She paused at the fountain to watch the billowing particles that climbed into the air, and then splashed down onto the lily pads. The wind fanned a mist across her flushed face. 'A boy," she whispered as she looked toward the children. Mornings in the park pass quickly, even on rainy days, and soon the youngsters had gone home for lunch. Evelyn walked slowly to the swings and, finding a dry one, sat down alone. She knew someone would be upset if they saw her sitting there, but it felt good to move back and forward effortlessly, to feel the 342 spring air flowing about her, and to listen to the tall pine trees that made a wall around her and sent a Christmas fragrance into her heart. She felt very much like a child again, with the whole world speaking to her. The rain kept reminding her of something, and, at length, all thoughts began to focus on a childhood day long ago: She was in the sixth grade and wandered down the _ dripping clean alley behind her parents' home. Houses looked different from the back. Soft green gardens peeked through the fences; raindrops stood on the cherry blossoms; flavor floated in the moist air like steam from a simmering kettle. At the end of the alley, she turned down the hill. Water splashing in the gutter disappeared with twirling, winged maple seeds into the drain on the corner. [. Took twenty minutes to walk to school, and it was now a quarter to nine, so she started running down Franklin Avenue. Drops pounding against her face reminded her that she had forgotten a scarf. Last year's raincoat and boots were too small, so she didn't worry about them, but her hair bobbed in annoying slick brown curls down her forehead. Occasionally, she didn't jump far enough and puddles sloshed onto her legs. Water running from the terraced lawns trickled down the cement. Trees arching over the street and sidewalk were gypsy arms dancing in the breeze. The sky was gray, and the spring earth wore countless shades of green. The last bell rang when she started up the stone stairs to the playground. Her thin plaid coat flew open, making wings behind her, as she raced across the huge, ~ deserted schoolyard. Then, suddenly, she was pattering down the hot, dark, disciplined. Halls and up the stairway. At her classroom door, she took a deep breath and cautiously pushed into the light, trying to sneak into the cloak hall, but Miss Allen had been watching for her. "Evelyn Harris, you're soaked. Take off those shoes and stockings and go comb your hair. I surely hope you're dry before the winner is anounced." She put her shoes on the floor by the radiator, and on the window sill lay the wet, uncomfortable stockings that had slipped down around her ankles. She placed her coat over a vacant desk and went to comb her hair. The purple dress was streaked wet down the front where her coat had flown open. She combed the short wet curls with her fingers and shook the skirt. Why had it rained today? The next hours were days in passing. Evelyn's eyes roamed to the window beside her. Budding leaves pressed against the pane; purple, half-opened iris lined the gray sidewalk below. Rain trickled down the steamed glass. The bell rang and spelling competition began. The clock was continuing quietly from minute to minute, when, at last, the door opened, and the principal's messenger entered. Evelyn blushed and told herself again not to be disappointed. ""The second princess," the boy read, "is Beverly Hill. The first princess," he conUntil tinued, "'is Jeanne Black. And the Queen is Evelyn Anne Harris." Her eyes widened. Smiling, she caught the nearest hand and held tight. The class gathered around; she saw nothing but smiles. Sunshine diffused through the clouds. What a lovely day! Tue lunch bell sounded and children pushed into the corridors. Water from. The steaming windows had collected on the sill and dampened her stockings, so Evelyn pattered down the dry, warm floor barefoot. With her laughing class at the long cafeteria table, she spread out her lunch and was taking the first bite when something dropped on her hair. Reaching up, she picked from the damp locks a piece of orange peel. She looked around. Everyone was eating. A few minutes later something flew. Against her back and fell to the floor. Grapes. She flung around in time to see children at the nearest table turn innocently back to their meals. Bits of bread came at her and her friends. She put her unfinished sandwich into the sack and slid from her chair. Whispers followed her from the room. "Boy, she sure looks like a queen. A barefoot queen. It must have been the little kids that voted for her. Who else would be that dumb?" In the late afternoon, Evelyn walked home in brittle shoes and dirty stockings. The rain had stopped, but the sky was still gray. She did not run now. Dipping birds glided in silence. Her head was stiff, her lips tight together. The last bit of rain trickled down the gutter; cinders in the alley were almost dry; 343 May 1967 many of the cherry petals had fallen to the new grass. At length, the girl opened the screen door of her home. Without looking up from the ironing, her mother noted the quiet entrance, and asked softly of the girl who leaned by the kitchen door, '"'What's the matter, dear, didn't you win?" Evelyn was silent, her head throbbing, and her throat, dry. Before she realized it, she was warm in her mother's arms crying out the words. Soft hands were brushing back her hair. Then all was quiet. She knew her mother would speak, and she listened, safely nestled in the cotton dress. "Sweetheart, there is only one real kind of queen in this world, and that's the queen mother in every good home. No other kind really matters. Someday you will be a real queen. Someday you will hold a little girl in your arms and you will understand what I mean. You'll never know, until then, how much I love you, and how much I'm hurt when you are." It was strange how clear the recollection was. Every word and feeling was alive, as if Evelyn had actually stepped back into the past and relived her earliest memory of the words that her mother had spoken so _ often "You'll never know how much I love you, until."" And Evelyn felt once more the reaction she had each time her mother had said it, "Oh, Mother, I know you love me. I know everything you have done for me. I understand. How can you think I don't, unless you think I'm an_ ungrateful child?" Then once again she could hear her mother's words, 344 "You'll never know how much I love you, until." The sky was clearing as Evelyn left the park. Blue was beginning to mingle with the parting gray, and sunshine fell in soft beams toward the earth. Birds fluttered from branch to branch singing notes of anticipation to their nests. Some of them soared in the dappled sky, and then floated on unseen breezes between the clouds. Evelyn wasn't the only one noticing the world around her. The children were returning from lunch, and one little boy was running with a huge red kite down the street. A little boy, she thought, as she pondered her mother's words, would be unable to understand the depth of his mother's love. A [, had happened so suddenly. Evelyn was waking up in the recovery room after a wonderful deep sleep. It was all over now. She had been exhausted when they wheeled her from the delivery room. They seemed to know, and had let her sleep. She looked at the white ceiling as the thoughts rushed in upon her. How foolish she had been to think it would never be over. Last night she had known, and felt it all begin. She marked each movement, unbelievingly, silently, not knowing whether to wake Don. When she finally did, he took over, rushing around, calling the doctor, trying to hurry her as she moved slowly, wonderingly. And that was all she could clearly remember until the baby's cry. "Is it a boy?" she asked. "No," beamed the doctor, ''you have a little girl." "A girl. Oh, a little girl!" she laughed and cried her tears of joy. And still she could see the love and pride in Don's face-as he looked at the little girl who was such a sweet surprise to both of them. "We'll call her Celestia Anne, for our mothers," he whispered. "I realized, while I was waiting, that we hadn't decided on a girl's name. Does it sound all right?" It was perfect, Celestia Anne. The door clicked open. '"'We're going to move you to your room now," the nurse said pleasantly, "and soon we'll bring your baby to you." Evelyn could feel her old impatience coming on, and tried to think of something to occupy her mind. First her thoughts turned to Don. How was he getting along without her? She was glad her mother would be there tomorrow to look after him�her mother. She could see the brown hair with streaks of silver, and the same sweet face that seemed sweeter with the passing time, and she could hear the words again, "You'll never know how much I love you until." Evelyn thought she knew now. It must be the beauty of the baby's first cry. How lovely that was. Or maybe it was the happiness she had seen in Don's face. Her parents had shared that many years before, and Evelyn hadn't known. What more could there be except the blessing of 'holding that little girl in her arms, loving her, and caring for her? At last the white ceiling stopped going by, and Evelyn was settled in her room. She tried to fight her impatience, but could -child, not someone else's, Until only watch the ticking minutes until the nurse moved through the door again, and then a little girl was in her arms�her own the first living thing she had ever received. Evelyn knew that she was experiencing something that she could never fully share with anyone. Warmth and love flowed like tears. Toward the helpless infant that lay trustingly in her arms. She fought to clear her thinking �to define for herself, if for no one else�the new feelings that swept over her., Tiny warm fingers were clinging to her own. Fingers, she thought, that will grow. What would that tiny hand one day accomplish? Drowsy, dark eyes wandered toward and then away from Evelyn's face. Little eyes that would soon recognize her and Don, and would teach that little body to imitate what they saw. Feet were wiggling. Such small feet that barely reached across Evelyn's palm. Where would those feet carry this little girl? Who was this little one? And then Evelyn realized that Celestia knew nothing now of who she was. She had forgotten. That would be the great task she and 345 May 1967 Don would face. They would have to teach Celestia who she was, and show her how to live so she would remain as pure as possible. Evelyn shuddered as she thought, for the first time, how much it would hurt to see sin, pain, or sorrow touch the little life that slept in her arms, and yet she know it could and must come All was silent. Evelyn was caught in the rapture of caressing a slumbering child, and as she did, she knew that her little girl could not remember this day and many of the ones to come. She realized that it would be many years before this tiny child would know how much she was cherished and loved. Without being aware that she had ever heard the words before, Evelyn began whispering to the tiny, peaceful face, "You'll never know how much I love you until you have a little one of your own." She caught her breath and wiped her eyes, overcome with a longing to see her mother and tell her how much she hadn't understood, and how much she was beginning to learn. * 2 ~~ In the Relief Society sessions of the stake quarterly conferences being conducted during this quarter of the year (1966), emphasis is being placed on the role of Relief Society in exercising watchcare over all Latter-day Saint homes through the visiting teaching program. Particular stress is being placed, also, upon the program as a resource of the bishop in obtaining, through the Relief Society ward president at the ward council meeting, significant information relative to the attitudes, the circumstances, and needs of families as revealed during the visit, particularly where there are inactive or unenrolled Relief Society members. This information becomes of value to the home teachers as they coordinate the efforts of Priesthood quorums and auxStandard of Performance in Visiting Teaching President Belle S. Spafford [ Address Delivered at the Presidencies Department of the Relief Society Annual General Conference, September 29, 1966] �� ee SPREE RE LE Le NE LE LENE LETS UB UBER NERS PERCE URERCRURERCRURURE iliary organizations under the direction of the bishop in activating all family members. As we consider the present intensified effort of the Church in its family-centered gospel program (which is conducted in each ward under the authority of the bishop, with the home teachers as his designated representatives in working with families), the Relief Society visiting teachers, as a reliable source of information obtained through their visits to homes, give to our visiting teaching program a new dimension. From the quarterly conference material I quote: The import of the visiting teacher report imposes upon the _ visiting teacher the responsibility of exercising extreme care to avoid misjudging the family situation, and to report precisely and factually without bias or exaggeration. It imposes upon the presi- 347 May 1967 dent the responsibility of giving to the report prompt and full consideration, wisely evaluating facts and passing on to the bishop such information as would properly go to him in order that he might have a correct understanding of the family circumstances as a guide for serving it through the Church. This statement suggests that perhaps Relief Society presidents, both ward and stake, might appropriately consider how the standards of visiting teaching might be raised, and whether a more careful evaluation of reports is needed by the visiting teachers and, in turn, by the ward presidents themselves at the ward council meetings. We have given great emphasis to the number of visits made annually to each family. Many wards and many stakes have adopted a "100%"' visiting teaching goal. This is creditable and to be encouraged. It now seems that the importance of the visit as an aid in the home teaching program calls for additional attention to be given to the quality of the visit and the precision of the report. In considering sisters to serve as a part of the ward visiting teaching corps, and in aiming toward improved standards of teaching and reporting on the part of the teachers, presidents may find it helpful to examine the qualities that contribute to a good teaching program. The General Board offers a few suggestions as follows: 1. Respect for the office as a Church calling, coupled with a desire to magnify the calling. 2. A firm personal testimony of the gospel. 3. An understanding knowledge of the duties and obligations of the call- 348 ing, together with a willingness to meet these responsibilities. 4. A recognition of the importance of adequate preparation for the visit, both as it relates to the spirit and personal appearance of the teacher, and also as it relates to to her preparation of the visiting teacher message. 5. A strong conviction of the value of Relief Society in the life of a woman gained by the visiting teacher through her regular attendance at Relief Society meetings, and through her participation in Relief Society activities. 6. An appreciation of what it means to go into the home of a sister as an emissary of Relief Society. 7. A sincere interest in the sister visited, and a genuine desire for the well-being of her home. 8. Thoughtful consideration of the most apprepriate time of the month and day of the week for the visit, as well as conscientious adherence to the recommended length of the visit. 9. The ability to establish rapport with the sister in the home and also to inspire her confidence in her visiting teachers. 10. A recognition of the importance of a listening ear, a seeing eye, and an understanding heart. 11. A recognition of the importance of avoiding any semblance of inquisitiveness or prying. (A realization that the visiting teacher is not called upon to diagnose family circumstances.) 12. A clear understanding that visiting teachers are not authorized to regulate a family, this being a Priesthood function. 18. The power to arrive at sound conclusions as to the attitudes, circumstances, and needs of the family, and the exercise of judgment as to what properly should be reported to the Relief Society president. 14. The ability to refrain from discussing with anyone, other than the Relief Society president, confidential matters revealed during the visit. 15. A cheerful outlook, and the power to create in the sisters an appreciation of the importance and value of being a part of the great Church sisterhood. This is an imposing list of attributes and abilities, but these Standards of Performance in Visiting Teaching are not beyond the reach of those sisters who are properly selected and called to serve as visiting teachers and who will earnestly strive to attain these qualifications. Tens of thousands of Relief Society sisters have demonstrated these virtues and abilities. Through the years some of the noblest women of this dispensation have exercised these qualifications as they have visited homes on their assigned districts, month after month. It was such a woman who came to my home as a visiting teacher when I was a very young mother and awakened in me a realization of my need for membership in Relief Society. It was she who opened the doors of my understanding to what Relief Society has to offer to a woman. While there are many sisters with whom most of these qualifications seem almost natural endowments, there are also others who have only the _ potential, which must be developed. Many of the visiting teachers are capable women with a sincere desire to give high standards of service, but are unaware of the many factors that contribute to effective visiting teaching. The great and important responsibility of creating an awareness of all that is involved in good visiting teaching and of guiding the sisters in the development of their teaching strengths is, in large measure, the responsibility of the ward president. In this responsibility, however, she should receive help from the stake Relief Society president. How may the ward Relief Society president approach these responsibilities? We offer for your consideration a few suggestions along this line�not new, to be sure, but nonetheless basic: 1. Dignify the calling by following the same procedures as are followed in calling any other woman to office in Relief Society: Be prayerful in the selection, and always refer names to the bishop or branch president for approval. 2. In interviewing the sister when she is called, fully explain the duties and obligations of the calling. 3. Know the visiting teachers as individuals. Be mindful of their personalities, special interests, and aptitudes, and what probably will be the general character of their visits. Then acsign them where they are likely to be best received and best able to do good. 4. Give guidance in proper teaching procedures and in making reports of visits, and strengthen the spirit and character of the visit through planned instruction during the time allotted the president in the visiting teacher meeting. 5. Make sure the ward message leader is a well-qualified leader who can help the teachers in an understanding of the message, its purpose, and its effective use in the home. 6. Stand ready to help teachers individually with special situations, troublesome to them, which are encountered in their visits. 7. Allow adequate time for confidential reports. Where a pair of visiting teachers needs guidance with regard to confidential reports, this would be an appropriate time for a president tactfully and _ skillfully to discuss reporting with them. 8. Keep close to the individual pairs of visiting teachers throughout the year. From time to time, as circumstances dictate, offer them encouragement and guidance in a spirit of love and appreciation for their serivces. 9. Tell them when you hear commendation of their work. Be quick to recognize their successes. For example, a president might say in proposing a sister for membership in Relief Society, '"We are presenting for your vote today the name of Ellen 349 May 1967 Jones as a member of Relief Society. It is through Sisters Martha Brown and Mary White, who are Sister Jones' visiting teachers, that Sister Jones became interested in joining Relief Society." Enthusiasm for the work must be kept up and one's vision of its importance continually broadened just as one's knowledge and skills in relation to performing the duties of the calling must be continually strengthened. The General Board sees valuable help coming from the stake through the presidents department in the leadership meeting as stake presidents keep in mind the needs of ward presidents in this important program. Value is also seen in a stake visiting teacher convention. We think visiting teacher conventions are most successful where the stake people themselves present the program. They know the people within the stake, the general circumstances within the wards, the problems, the needs, and the resources. They are best positioned to be genuinely helpful. Visiting teaching has flourished for almost one and one quarter centuries, because it offers, through the mother organization of the Church, orderly, inspired, needed, Priesthood-guided watchcare and service to our Latterday Saint families. As it takes on new dimensions as an aid in the home teaching program, let us make sure it maintains a reputation for both quality and quantity service.

Elaine Stevenson Michelsen of Salt Lake City, Utah, by invitation of the Exhibits Committee, displayed nineteen paintings in the marble niches of the art galleries of the new Rockefeller Building in New York City last September and October. The exhibit brochure designates her as an ''artist, lecturer, and teacher of international recognition." She studied at the University of Paris and with German impressionist Oscar Kokoschka, was United States delegate to the International Congress for Education through Art held at the Hague, Holland, in 1957, and collaborated and shared research in the workshop of Habib Gorgi, Chief Inspector of Art of the Egyptian Ministry of Culture. She also painted the nine stunning historical murals of the Del E. Webb Building in Phoenix, Arizona. Irene Geiringer has collaborated with her husband, Karl Geiringer, in writing Johann Sebastian Bach: The Culmination of an Era (New York, Oxford Press). The book presents Bach anew to the twentieth century. Much has been discovered during the last thirteen years regarding the immortal Johann, particularly the dating of his "church music," which lay unpublished until the late nineteenth century, and also regarding his artistic development and even his objectives as a composer. Margaret Sanborn is the author of Robert E. Lee: A Portrait, 1807-1861 (Philadelphia and New York: J. B.

Carling Timeless Words @ In every language there are words so broad and beautiful in their meaning that they have become treasured over the generations. They recall an assembly of meanings and an adornment of spiritual magnitude. Over the ages the words repeat an ancient truth to those who live in other eras of the time of man upon the earth. Timeless words, beloved for centuries through the holy Bible, have been repeated in the scripture of the restoration, and in the congregations of the saints, in the teachings of the missionaries, in counsel and direction from the special witnesses. Timeless words have been repeated in humble meetinghouses, in chapels throughout the world. They have been given a sincere radiance by Relief Society sisters in declarations of faith and gratitude for blessings. The word gospel, in its everlasting splendor, has been a treasured word throughout the generations. So it was written in Revelation (14:6) "And | saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation."' In August 1830, only a few months following the organization of the Church in the latter days, the Prophet Joseph Smith received a revelation (D&C Section 27) regarding the fulness of the everlasting gospel, and the timeless words of that day and place have become scripture for the saints in every land and a message to the nations: 'Stand, therefore with the preparation of the gospel of peace, which | have sent mine angels to commit unto you; Taking the shield of faith. "' Again, the inspired translation of The Book of Mormon repeats the timeless word�-gospel�the glad tidings, and illuminates the message with an even wider splendor, through the words of the Savior, appearing to the Nephites on the American Continent, where ''he did expound all things unto them."' The records, being inscribed with timeless words, applying to all people in every generation, were given to complete the fulness of the gospel "'for it was wisdom... That they should be given unto future generations.... And if it so be that the church is built upon my gospel then will the Father show forth his own works in it."' An essential element of the gospel�the building of temples and the carrying out of their exalted purposes, calls to mind another timeless word�temple. 'One thing have | desired... That | seek after... To behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his temple' (Psalm 27:4). In the time of the kings of Israel and over the centuries into that day when Jesus as a boy stood among the learned ones in the temple at Jerusalem, the word temple has evoked a multitude of sacred contemplations. Early in the time of the restoration of the gospel, the timeless word temple was glorified anew by the saints of the latter days. Through revelation the sacred words for the dedication of the first temple of the last dispensation came to the Prophet Joseph Smith, in the year 1836, in Kirtland, Ohio: ''... We ask thee, O Lord, to accept of this house, the workmanship of our hands. Which thou didst command us to build. For thou knowest that we have done this work through great tribulation; and out of our poverty we have given of our substance to build a house to thy name. And weask that thy servants may go forth from this house armed with thy power. And from this place they may bear exceedingly great and glorious tidings...'' (D&C Section 109). Gratitude and rejoicing expressed in words of lasting splendor were spoken in 1888 within the great stone walls of a temple erected upon a commanding hill, against the watchful mountains, in a time of scarcity of material riches, yet in a time of humility-and spiritual grandeur: ''We glorify thy great name, Almighty Father, for these communications of intelligence and power to man in the flesh again.... Thou didst soften the rigor of unfriendly elements, and didst cause the clouds to scatter refreshing showers, the hills to yield their treasures of snow, and springs of living water to come from the dry and parched ground.... The everlasting hills have yielded their treasures.... When thy people shall approach thee give them knowledge of the ancestry of their generations. We dedicate to thee the records which shall be kept..."" (Dedication of the Manti Temple). So the timeless words and the timeless records are bound together in the heritage of the saints that they may always remember. V. P.

I" DESERT HOME \ The poplar trees we planted now are gone, The house itself is but an empty shell, Its windows broken, one door hanging on; No water pours from our artesian well.

Yes, everything is changed, but still | see My mother standing in the dappled shade Her eyes alight with love. This memory, Unlike material things, can never fade. For she, with her working hands, her velvet singing. Had made the desert home in the beginning. \ @ Enola Chamberlin /) 357 7 fi /, (Cail, Jeu Helen M. Stock Oh, weary mothers, when you sew Don't you wish that clothes would grow On a pinafore bush or a school-dress tree? Then how happy little girls would be! � Team-sewing isn't exactly like picking clothes off a tree, but it is the next best thing. When two women work together in the spirit of an old-fashioned quilting-bee, little clothes almost seem to roll off the sewing machine and _ ironing board. Two or more dresses can be completed in the same time it takes a lone woman to make one dress. When the team becomes efficient, as many as four little dresses can be finished in a day's time. Women who have tried working together say, "Sewing with someone else makes the day so pleasant, and we get so much more done." It is one answer to the budget-minded woman who wants her children welldressed. How is team sewing done? Two women plan to work together (neighbors, or perhaps a mother and daughter). One team member keeps the sewing machine humming as she moves the fabric under the needle in a continuous process. 358 The second team member clips threads, presses, trims, pins, and stacks the prepared pieces for the first worker to continue sewing. Team-sewing is easiest for children's clothing, because their garments are usually so simple and need little fitting. However, adult clothes could be made by the same method. For speedy work, select a pattern that can be used a number of times, yet be modified to make each dress look freshly different from the others by changing collar shapes, belts, or sleeve lengths. (The pattern companies show 'a number of these dresses, with suggestions for changes. ) Get the materials that have the same background color so that one thread can be used for all the dresses. To simplify cutting, buy fabrics of the same width. Touches of hand decoration on collars and cuffs may be added by even the busiest of mothers, but leave the long, hand-finished seams and the yards of embroidery or smocking for a doting grandmother or favorite aunt to make. Of course, the pattern is altered. To fit the child before cutting. First, take the measurement from the shoulder point to shoulder point, and make this correction. Then, because most children are growing up, not out, correct the waist length. Cutting two or three dresses at one time is a simple timesaver. If the pattern is laid on a center fold, have all the center folds of fabric pinned exactly together and pin the pattern according to the pattern guide. For the sake of accuracy, it is not advisable to cut more than three dresses at one time. Sharp scissors will cut through four or six layers of fabric, but if the scissors are not sharp enough to cut through so much material, cut the top dress first, then the second one, and finish with the last dress. You have saved time by pinning the pattern once. Arrange the sewing equipment in this manner: (1) Pieces cut and stacked in the order of construction. (2) Sewing machine (3) Ironing board (4) Pieces that have been pressed and are ready for the second sewlng process. A. Worker at machine B. Worker at ironing board. This arrangement speeds teamsewing, as clothes go from (1) stack to (2) the sewing machine, then Sew! Team, Sew! (3) the ironing board, and back to (4) stack for more machine sewing. Each woman sits as she works. Following the construction guide, the first worker completes the same step on all garments before going to the next. She sends one piece right after the other under the needle never breaking the thread between. Usually no more than half an inch thread connects the pattern pieces. The second worker clips the pieces apart and prepares them for the next sewing process by pinning and pressing. Women who have tried team-sewing suggest that before sewing, one bobbin should be filled for each dress to be made. They also say that pieces when first stacked in order of sewing, should have an accompanying pattern unpinned and lying atop that piece of fabric. Each worker needs scissors and a pincushion. To avoid early fatigue, they alternate the workers at the machine and ironing board after each hour of work. Reports are that team-sewing is challenging, and that workers may need to change their habits of sewing. They also suggest it is a nice way to work as a family. Girls have spent a full day sewing when, if they worked alone, they would be worn out after an hour or two. In fact, one girl said at the end of a busy day, "I like it," and turning to her mother added, "'let's make two more tomorrow." Why don't you enlist the help of a daughter or neighbor, and sew team-fashion for your family? Editorial Note: This team sewing plan could well be adapted for use in the homemaking meeting, for use in filling welfare assignments, and it may be found useful, also, in teaching the summer sewing class. 359 We Took An Old Chair if as Margaret Woods Walsall, Leicester Stake, England @ We wanted the bedroom to have an a atmosphere all its own, but we couldn't find the right bedside tables. Then we took an old chair with one stave at the front and back and two staves at each side and painted it the color we required. We fitted three pieces of hardboard across the lower side staves to make a platform on which to rest favorite bedside books. The upper side staves | prevented the books from falling sidea ways. Then we made a trimmed, rectangular bag to slip over the chair back and added a dainty table mat and lamp. The effect was just right. So then we made another similar ''table-chairbookcase"' for the other side of the bed. For a different effect, a mirror could be attached to the back of the chair above the ''table-chair-bookcase."' 360 Recipes From Guatemala Maria C.

The bended limbs all straighten When the sunshine comes again. The winds of life may darken � Blinding storm clouds dim the way, But strength comes with the morning And lifts our burdens today. @ Catherine B. Bowles 361 Cleaning Up After A Ward Dinner Elaine K. Jones @ The Relief Society organization probably handles and prepares more food than any other organization of the Church. Therefore, we should learn how and teach others to maintain cleanliness, prevent food contamination, and speed up the cleanup after a dinner. There are certain rules we should uphold at all times: 1. Always wash hands before handling food. 2. Wear hairnets in the kitchen�especially those who wear their hair long. Never allow hair to be combed around food. 3. In handling food, wear plastic gloves. They are very inexpensive and well worth having as part of your kitchen equipment. You will find in serving chicken, meat, tossed salad, you can do it much faster if you use your hands. 4. Organize your cleanup. Cleaning up after a ward dinner need not be the thing we used to dread, if we organize our help and follow the suggestions which have been made by sisters who have been working in Relief Society for many years: DISHWASHING A. Cooking Utensils During the banquet, someone should be assigned to wash the bowls, pans, etc. As they are emptied, so that when the dirty dishes are brought in, the pans will be out of the way. B. Silverware Inasmuch as the silverware is taken off the table first, it should be washed first and put away, leaving room for the plates. Separate the silverware when clearing the table. Assign someone to do this �provide the person with containers (such as cardboard boxes) one for knives, one for forks, and one for spoons. Doing this first will prevent any silverware being lost in the garbage. After you have washed the silverware, place it in a bucket which you have prepared beforehand. These buckets may be made from the gallon cans your vegetables came in. Poke holes in the bottom and one on each side at the top, where you can put a wire for a handle. Dip each bucket of clean silverware into boiling water to which 2 tbsp. Of vinegar have been added. After the water has drained from the bucket, empty the silverware onto a table on a clean sheet or on terry-cloth toweling, and let it dry itself. There will be no soap stains and the silverware will dry quickly. Since they are already separated, putting them away can be done quickly. 362 Cleaning Up After a Ward Dinner (The Boy Scouts suggested that we might use a nylon bag which has a drawstring in the top, instead of the bucket, then hang the bag on the limb of a tree to dry.) C. Dishes Assign someone to follow those clearing away the silver to scrape the plates, using a paper napkin to slide the "waste into a garbage can or large cardboard box. The scraped dishes should be stacked on a table assigned for them. There is nothing so frustrating to the dishwashers as dishes all over the kitchen with food still on them. Bring the Stacks of plates into the kitchen as the dishwashers are ready for them. (A table can be placed in the hall near the kitchen for the dirty dishes�or at some other convenient place.) Pre-rinse the dishes if possible. Wash in good, soapy water, and rinse. There is no need to dry your dishes if they are rinsed in good hot water to which a little vinegar has been added. This softens the water and prevents soap stains. Sanitize. (To sanitize use 1 tbsp. Clorox to each gallon of water.) Drain. Obtain drainers which will fit in your sink�as each drainer fills up with dishes, take it out and let dry. One of our wards bought terry cloth on sale, which is very absorbent. They cut it in lengths to fit the table and cupboard in their kitchen. They also cut lengths to be used for dish-towels, all you need to do is hem the ends. May your kitchen cleanup be much quicker, more efficient, and fun. MINCEMEAT��OATMEAL DROP COOKIES Juanita Hebert 34, c. Shortening 1 tsp. Vanilla 114 c. Sugar 1 c. Flour 1 egg 1 tsp. Salt 14 c.

Scurr, Colorado Springs, Colorado, has fitted well into the pattern of Relief Society, although she has been a member of the Church for only ten years. The emphasis which Relief Society puts upon the development of one's talents, the making of beautiful adornments for the home, are the very accomplishments in which Sister Scurr has excelled ever since her girlhood. Some of her most precious '"'pieces'' are cut work tablecloths�an intricate and highly skilled art. She has crocheted tablecloths, afghans, and bedspreads, has embroidered many pillowcases and quilt tops. Her applique work is colorful and neatly stitched in original designs. She does her quilting with hoops and believes that this method has many advantages. It is a tradition for Sister Scurr to bind all the quilts made by her ward Relief Society. Elizabeth Scurr's husband died when her son was an infant. She managed her husband's real estate business and reared her son and educated him. He is now president of Pike's Peak Stake. Her son and his family give much joy and comfort to Sister Scurr, and she has a crocheted tablecloth and a quilt tucked away for each of her five grandchildren, and has recently completed an exquisite crocheted cloth and presented to her ward for the sacrament table. The cloth represents 1260 hours of labor and 1500 yards of thread. 364 y Tlie i Golden Chain Chapter 4 Hazel M. Thomson Synopsis: Nora Blake, having no family ties after the death of her mother, secures a_ schoolteaching position in Banner, Idaho, where she lives in the home of Bishop Shepherd and becomes acquainted with a Latterday Saint family. She meets Jed Oliver, a local rancher and member of the bishopric, and young Ben Wade, an orphan who lives with Jed. � Nora made it a matter of importance to pay a call to the home of each of her pupils. By early December, she had made a visit to all except the Oliver home. She hesitated about going there, yet felt that she had a responsibility to contact Jed concerning Ben's progress, just as she: had the parents of the other students. One afternoon as Ben helped her straighten the room after the other students had left for the day, Nora mentioned her problem to him. "T've_ visited all the other a7 homes, Ben. I wondered what to do about yours." She noted a brief hesitation on Ben's part. ""You mean come out to the house?" he asked, without looking at her. "Well, I don't know," answered Nora. "Perhaps it would be better to ask Jed to stop in here at school and look over some of your work." Again Ben hesitated. "Do you have to, Miss Blake?" he asked. "Well, no. I don't exactly have to, but I should think you would want Jed to come and talk to me about your progress. It isn't that you're having any trouble. Quite the opposite and I should think | you'd want him to hear about your success." "T don't know what to tell you. I just don't know. You better let me ask Jed. I'll tell you in the morning what he says." It was with mixed feelings of anticipation and apprehension that Nora awaited Ben's arrival the following morning. She told herself that it was the natural timidity of the new, inexperienced teacher to visit with the parents of her students. Still, 365 May 1967 she knew this was not the only reason for her feelings. She forced herself to face one fact. She wanted to see Jed Oliver again. Ben came at once to the room and right to the point. "Jed said he'd come tonight after school, Miss Blake," he said. "But I might as well tell you that he wasn't very happy about it. Especially since this is our night for Shakespeare, and he doesn't like anything, not anything, to interfere. We just finished King Lear, and now we're on Hamlet. Jed got quite cross this morning and told me to put the book away when we were straightening up the kitchen. Said we most likely wouldn't have any time at all tonight, since we'd be so late with. The chores." "You shouldn't be too late," said Nora. "I don't have any particular problems to discuss about you. But your work is so fine I think Jed should know of that, too." Ben stood there, awkwardly. He shifted his feet. "IT told Jed that it didn't matter too much, that I didn't mind if he didn't want to come and talk about my work, and I'd still try hard to do my lessons as well as I could. But he said, no, the other kids all had someone to see what they had been doing, and he would do the same for me. I know he's not happy about coming, though." Nora was puzzled. It was plain that Ben didn't particularly want Jed to come. She could not understand it. Usually, a student who performed as Ben did, was anxious to have a parent see his work. There seemed to be something strange about the situation, 366 but she could not figure out what it was. Jed came all right, just as the last students were leaving for home. He was carrying a large poster. "Mrs. Allen stopped me and asked if I would bring this and have you put it up in the school about the dance on Friday." "Of course," said Nora. "T'll put it on the bulletin board and ask the children to remind their parents." As Nora stuck a tack through the top of the paper she noticed that the dance was to be on Saturday. She said nothing, however, about Jed's error as she returned to her desk. "T asked Ben to have you stop in," said Nora, "because I particularly wanted to show you some of his writing. This theme is beautifully written. Here, read it and see what you think." Nora held the pages toward. Him. After a moment Jed took them, still standing in front of her desk. "Sit down," said Nora, motioning to a chair. "And read it aloud. I think you'll get the effect of it better that way." Jed seemed to be waiting. He stood there, holding the papers. Then he cleared his throat, but he did not begin to read. Like a flash, the idea struck Nora and she wondered why she had not realized it before. There had been so many indications. He sometimes picked up a book in church and held it in his hand while making some point in a sermon, but she had never seen him open one and read any of it. Ben had wondered on the day Nora first came that Jed would want a boy his age around. Of course! That's how he got his Shakespeare, too. Ben read it to him! Jed Oliver could not read! Nora glanced again at the sign about the dance. It said in big, bold letters that the dance would be Saturday. Nora remembered hearing Mrs. Shepherd say that it had been changed from Friday, as planned originally. Jed had known only that the dance was first planned for Friday, but he knew nothing of the date being changed, even after carrying the poster all the way to the school. Nora looked at Jed standing there so tall and handsome and proud, and she felt that they shared a great loneliness, his from being shut off from the world of books which was so much a part of her own life, and her own loneliness because she was so very much alone in the world. A feeling she didn't quite recognize swept over her, perhaps pity, certainly a great sympathy, she wasn't quite sure. But she knew that she must do what she could to help him. She knew his secret but he had no idea that she knew, and she had no idea how she was going to tell him. Nora quickly got Ben's papers together and held the rest of them out to Jed. "Here," she said. "I know you're in a hurry to get back to your chores. Take these with you, The Golden Chain and tell Ben how very proud of him I am." She could sense Jed's relief as he took the papers and left. Other things began to occur to her. She had thought whenever she heard Jed speak, that he had no need to read from a book because he had the passages so well memorized. How many times Ben must have read some of those scriptures to him! She had been drawn toward this man from her first meeting. Today, she had felt the feeling stronger than before. But she remembered Mrs. Shepherd saying that Jed Oliver, for some reason, didn't like schoolteachers. Here was the reason. He was afraid of them, afraid one of them would learn his carefully guarded secret. A few days later, Nora walked into the Shepherd kitchen to find the bishop and his wife sitting at the table, a map spread cut between them. "Nora! Why don't you take up a forty?" asked the bishop. "Me? A forty? Forty what?" "Acres. Forty acres of land. The Government is opening two whole new sections for homesteading." Nora laughed. "What in the world would I do with forty acres of land?" she asked. "Keep it. Improve it. Then, if or when you move from here, you should be able to sell it and make yourself a good profit." ' Nora thought about the idea a great deal that night and gradually it did not seem so funny. By morning, which was Saturday, she told Mr. Shepherd that she would go with him to Mountain | 367 May 1967 View and sign up for the land. She was somewhat surprised to find that there was no big rush to the county courthouse. "Most folks hereabouts have all the land they can take care of," said the bishop. "But this is virgin land, Nora. It's never so much as even felt the point of a plow. It will make good farms, and you'll not be sorry you own a piece of it." Nora Blake, landowner. It had a nice sound to it. And, somehow, as Nora looked at the little square on the plat before her, it seemed to give her a place of her own here among the Mormons. Although she wasn't a member, from now on she would belong. She, Nora Blake, who had never owned much of anything, now owned a piece of land. There was a record in the courthouse that said so. As they left the courthouse, they met Jed Oliver coming in. He nodded to Nora and shook hands with the bishop and hurried on. The bishop chuckled. "T knew Jed would be along," he said. 'He has a hankering for land. You might say he doesn't want all the land in the world� just the part that touches his. I knew he wouldn't pass up a chance like this." On Wednesday, a very angry Jed Oliver appeared in the schoolhouse door as Nora was about to leave. "That piece of land," he said, "what could you possibly want with forty acres of land?" "What could I want with it?" Nora asked, as she fumbled with the papers on her desk. '"That's a strange question for you to ask. What do you want with land? 368 Maybe my interest is the same as yours." "It couldn't be," he said. "I've had my eye on that piece of land for a good long time. Since it joins what I already have, seems to me I'm the logical one to have it." Nora looked at him, holding the day's arithmetic papers in mid-air. "'Does it join yours?" she asked. "Yes, it joins mine. And it's exactly the piece of land I thought I was getting. But now I hear that you have signed for it, and mine is the next forty to that. You can't mean you _ didn't know?" "Of course I didn't know." Nora felt her anger rising. He seemed to be implying that her choice had been made because of the nearness to his own property. "How could I know? All I saw was a little square on a map. I did not know it joined yours, and I certainly did not know it was the piece you thought you were getting." He stood there, glaring at her. Nora tried to explain further. "Mr. Shepherd said since I was here, and since the Government happened to open up those sections for homesteading right now, that I might as well get in on it and own a piece of land for myself, and I'm getting to like the idea more and more all the time." "But it can't really matter to you." he cried. "All you're interested in is forty acres of land. How about trading straight across, your forty for mine?" Nora could not understand her own feelings in the matter, but she shook her head. "T can't trade," Nora said. "You mean you won't!"' "Cant. Wont. Let's just say I want the land for which I signed." "That's just like a woman," cried Jed. ''Here you've never seen either piece, and yet you refuse to trade!" Nora, too, felt a certain unreasonableness in the matter, but, as she watched Jed turn and stride from the room, she made no move to call him back. Then she remembered her resolve to teach Jed Oliver to read. She ran to the door. He was just getting on his horse. She couldn't have him leave in anger. "Wait!" she cried, "'wait!" She looked up at him from beside his horse. "T still don't want to trade the land," she said, "but I'd like to help you another way." "What do you mean?" he asked, his eyes on the bridle reins in his hand. "I think you know what I mean," said Nora. "How to read. I could teach you, if you are willing to try." He didn't answer, and Nora continued. "'Wouldn't you like to learn?" She could see him struggling within himself, his recent anger pitted against an evidently intense desire. He gave a sigh of relief as if a great weight had been lifted. "Yes, I would," he said. "Yes. I'd give anything to know how. I've always been afraid to." "Afraid to let anyone know you couldn't?" she asked. "TI never had a chance for school," he said. "But Ben's growing up. I won't always have him to read for me." The Golden Chain Nora was somewhat surprised at his willingness. She feared she had made him so angry that it would take some talking to get his consent, yet here he was, eager to learn. How she wished she could be sure that he welcomed a chance to work with her as she did to work with him. It meant that she would see him almost every day. Then another thought occurred to her. Tur Jand! Of course! The land. That was it. His not being able to read had caused him to sign for the wrong piece! His love for land had made him determined not to have such a thing ever happen again and, because of this, he was willing to learn to read. But she might just as well face facts, Jed Oliver had no interest in her. Nora found her task a bit different from that of starting a small child to read, who knew none of the alphabet. Jed knew all the letters, but he had not learned to associate any sounds with them. He was an apt student, spurred on by his great desire to learn. Even with his regular appearances at the school, however, Nora recognized that the situation made any personal relationship between them more impossible than ever. She sensed his feelings of inadequacy, as he took his reader from his saddle bag each day upon his arrival, Nora felt that he was hiding the book there, so as not to be seen riding through town with it. There were times that she would smile inwardly, when she would look up and see his bright, red head bent studiously over the small book, his hands looming 369 May 1967 large on the back of it where, before, she had seen only children's hands; but his seriousness prevented her smile from coming to the surface. She felt she owed him this. He had, probably, saved her life, and, certainly, from some sort of disaster, in her encounter with the bull. By giving of her time and effort to teach him to read, she felt that, in a measure, she was repaying her debt. Ai Christmas time Nora _ directed her students in an operetta. It was held in the ward amusement hall. The children performed very well, and the parents all enjoyed it. Nora found herself searching the audience for a certain head of red hair, but Jed did not come. Even Bishop Shepherd noticed that Jed was staying home from everything he could possibly miss, coming out only to Sunday meetings. It became the reason for a bit of questioning on the part of the bishop, directed at Nora. "We both told Jed, Brother Allen and myself, when Jed was called to the bishopric, that he really ought to be getting himself a wife. That's been over a year now. He said he'd work on it, and I'll admit that when you came I thought he might really get into action, but it seems that he's doing less and less about the problem." Aware of her own deep feelings, wondering whether the bishop could possibly be aware of them, too, Nora blushed furiously under his gaze, but he continued as if he had not noticed. '"'"Jed's always been one to lead out in Church activities, socials, and the like, Now all of a sudden he doesn't 370 even come. Do you have any idea why, Nora?" She shook her head, unable to trust her voice. "I know he's always had a general dislike for all schoolteachers," the bishop went on. "T'm like Trudy. I, too, think Miss Amy had her cap set for Jed until she decided it was no use. As far as I know, he only danced with her once or twice. But he was different after you came. I've heard him speak so highly of you." Nora's heart pounded, but she was determined to hold her feelings within herself�her intense loneliness in her personal life, and her desire to mean something to Jed Oliver. "The only place I ever see him go, other than church, is out the Old Free's cabin. Jed has a strange liking for the old man, and it's a good thing that he goes out there regularly. It's seldom that anyone else in town ever bothers to. Oh, we go out occasionally as a bishopric making a call, but the old fellow could die out there alone, and there'd be no one keeping an eye out for him, if it wasn't for Jed." Nora had heard a little about Old Free. He had been the subject of more than one lunchtime at school. Joe Pine mentioned the name first, one noon when he was trying to get his little sister Josie to eat her sandwich before her cake. "You better eat it, Josie," Joe had said, "or I'll have Old Free get you." This had brought a general round of laughter, prompting Nora to ask, "'Who is 'Old Free?' "' "Oh," said Joe, "he's an old man that lives out north of town a ways, all by himself. He's got a big long beard and long hair, and he's a sight to scare the devil himself."' Nora saw that Josie had started on her sandwich and was fairly gulping it down. "See, Miss Blake?" Joe had said, laughing. "Josie doesn't want to have anything to do with him. See her eat her sandwich now!" "Old Free's a hermit," said Trudy Shepherd. "He lives all by himself, and that makes him a hermit. He could be a miser, only miser's have to have lots of money, and Pa says Old Free doesn't have any gold now. He used to have some, but not anymore." '"He's more than a hermit," said Sarah Norton. "My father says he was in the mob that killed Joseph Smith." This information left the group rather quiet. Yet, as she looked at their faces, Nora decided that it was only news to her and rather common knowledge to the boys and girls. Nora felt a sort of kinship with this old man whom she had never seen, knowing as she did that she and the old man were the only two people in the entire community who were not Mormons. The snow grew deep, and the weather became bitterly cold. Bishop Shepherd said it was the worst winter he could remember. The realization came slowly that a sickness was invading the town, and that it was increasing to epidemic proportions. But there came a cold morning when Nora The Golden Chain arrived at school to find only Ben Wade, Sam Shepherd, and Joe Pine present. _�"Everybody's got the flu, Miss Blake," said Joe. "Josie is real sick this morning." "Jed's down with it, too, said Ben. "I've had all the cows to milk now for three days. He said he was feeling better, though, this morning. He's been pretty sick. Sure hope I don't get it." "I hope you don't, too," said Nora. ''We might just as well all go back home. Mr. Shepherd said not to hold school unless we had at least ten here."' Nora rode along beside Ben back to the Shepherd home on the little bay mare the bishop had provided for her. She was thinking that she could be a lot of help now to Mrs. Shepherd. The bishop was down with the sickness, as were all of the Shepherd children, except Sam. Sam galloped on ahead and was already unsaddled and throwing hay down from the loft for the horses, when she and Ben arrived. Ben went on toward his home as Sam came and took Nora's horse to the barn. At the porch steps, Nora stopped and stared. There on the snowy porch lay the bishop. The full coal bucket had evidently tipped over as he fell. She screamed for Sam, and the two of them managed to get the unconscious man inside the house and on the couch in the living room. Bertha Shepherd hadn't looked well that morning, and now Nora wasn't surprised to find that she had taken to her bed just off the living room. She walked unsteadily as she came in, fastening her robe as she came. 371 May 1967 "IT thought he had been gone too long," she said, "and was just about ready to get up and go look for him." "T'll sit by him and keep sponging his face off,' said Nora. "'He seems to be burning up with fever. But you had better get back in bed." Under their careful ministrations, Bishop Shepherd at last became rational, and only then did his wife consent to return to her own bed. The rest of the day was a nightmare for Nora. "IT remember filling the coal bucket," said the bishop. "It seemed awfully heavy, as I carried it back to the house, and that's all I remember." "We found you on the porch," said Nora. "Sam and I. You couldn't have been out there too long, or you'd have been covered with snow. I'm glad we didn't stay at school any longer." "Am I!" he exclaimed. "It was an act of providence that you arrived when you did." By sundown Nora was dead tired. Sam had been good help, trying to keep the fire going in the bedroom upstairs, as well as in in the stoves downstairs. Ellen wasn't really too uncomfortable and was able to care for Robbie beside her in bed. She got Mark in with her on the other side. This left Nora free to devote most of her time to Trudy. And Trudy was a very sick girl. She kept sponging the child off in an effort to lower her temperature, but it was evident that Trudy was not responding to the treatment. Downstairs, she could hear the bishop's voice. "'I feel better than 372 I have in three days. I think I can get up and help with the chores tonight." Nora ran halfway down the stairs. "But you mustn't!" she cried. 'If you do, you're sure to be back in bed tomorrow. I've never actually milked a cow, but I've seen you and Sam and Trudy do enough of them until I have the general idea. I'm sure I can do it. I'll bring Trudy downstairs while I'm gone." Nora raced back to the bedroom to find that Trudy, as her father had earlier in the day, had lapsed into a coma. Gently, she lifted the child in her arms and carried her down and placed her beside Mrs. Shepherd. "Trudy, dear,''? Murmured Mrs. Shepherd. ''My sweet little Trudy! They administered to her last night, but she seems worse." The bishop came in as his wife again arose unsteadily from her bed, and the two of them sat for a long time, watching their little girl, trying to get a drop of water down her throat, trying everything they could think of, and just watching. Once the bishop spoke of Sam. '"'He does the work of a man," he said. "If I could only hire someone to help him." "Don't worry about it," said Nora, rising to her feet. "T'll just put on your old coat and boots and do what Sam tells me."' As she neared the barn, she noticed a strange looking figure helping Sam drive the cows in. He was rather a tall man, and thin, with long white hair showing beneath his hat, and a long beard. Old Free! Of course! It couldn't be anyone else. "Hello," said Nora, looking at him in the light cast by the lantern through the open door. "T'm Miss Blake. And -you're Freedom Lang, aren't you? I was coming out to help Sam with the chores." "You go along back," he said. "The bishop's been mighty good to me on occasion. First time I've had a chance to pay him back. Tell him I'll be here in the morning, too, and for as long as he needs me." Nora felt the first bit of relief that she had known since the The Golden Chain beginning of this long, long day. But, at the door of the house, she learned that tragedy which had_ been hovering over the home "all day, had struck with full force. Bishop Shepherd sat on the couch, holding Trudy in his arms. Mrs. Shepherd and Ellen stood near, weeping. "She's gone, Nora," said the bishop. "Trudy has gone, in spite of our faith that she might be made well." (To be continued) la (When lost eleven but you stood THE FAVORITE How young she seemed, to be so old� because all schoolteachers were full of years� or no, were ageless, having always existed. Was a chasm behind twelve, how could twelve-to-twenty ever be bridged?) She was the favorite, being gentle and the most beautiful, with oval-mooned face for eyes dove-gray, and the slight smile 'that seemed to know what you were thinking. Her summerlight brown hair she twisted into a knot less inescapable than a marcel and more�oh, more�enchanting. There was the day she asked you (Breath-stopped moment!) to help her carry books to the teachers' room, and then a hairpin fell, so she must tell you, wait, while she caught up the shining twist again. And how you watched the silken light tumble over her shoulder! �so soft, if you reached out your hand you would feel nothing; and your fingers tingled, wanting the feel of that nothing� quiet, hurting with adoration, while from the mirror she looked back at you and smiled her secret smile. @ Lael W. Hill 3738 374 y\ \ Magazine Honor Roll for 1966 Counselor Marianne C. Sharp @ As Relief Society grows among the daughters of Zion, The Relief Society Magazine spreads its message to ever-increasing numbers. The General Board is gratified by the increase of 11, 625 subscriptions in 1966 making a total of 252,902 subscriptions. The year 1966 is also a notable one in the history of The Relief Society Magazine because a Spanish edition commenced publication in June 1966. As of December 31, there were 5,590 subscribers. Many letters are received at the office of the General Board from Spanish-speaking sisters of South America, Central America, Mexico, and the Philippines expressing their gratitude. More Latter-day Saint sisters speak Spanish than any other language, except English. The grand total of Relief Society Magazine subscriptions, at the conclusion of 1966 is 258,492. The large subscription to the Relief Society Magazine is an important factor in keeping the price of the English subscription down to $2 a year. In the true spirit of sisterhood, those concerned with the Magazine at Relief Society Headquarters, and the presidents and Magazine representatives throughout Relief Society organizations give unstintingly of their time and talents in producing and selling this great and vital means of promoting and binding the world-wide sisterhood. The spirit of Magazine representatives is exemplified by this letter: To Relief Society Magazine Sisters� Dear Sisters: This will be my last order for the Magazine. After twenty years and eight months, | have to give this privilege to a younger sister as | am so crippled | cannot help myself. | have to depend on the other sisters to take my walker or my wheel chair whenever | go out. Most of the cars are too small to hold them, and it is too much for the sisters to handle them, so | am not able to get to the stake meetings. | am grateful for having had this privilege and will do all | can to help the dear sister who will take my place. February 27th | will have my 81st birthday and cannot get around to contact the sisters as | should. It makes me feel very sad to have to give it up. | am grateful to my Heavenly Father for all the blessings he has given me, and for the many friends | have, both old and young. Sincerely, Sister Frances Kolarik The calling of a Magazine representative requires dynamic and unselfish service. She is enthusiastic over the worth of the Magazine, keeps abreast with its contents, seeks out the Latter-day Saint women, and is persuasive in selling its value to the sisters. She knows that any woman who reads and studies it will be better prepared to fulfill her great functions as a woman and as a Relief Society worker. Heartfelt appreciation of the General Board goes to all those who have accomplished this outstanding record in 1966. There were 371 stakes on the Honor Roll, and 180 having 100 per cent or more subscriptions. Twenty-four missions were on the Honor Roll, and four missions achieved 100 per cent or more. For the twentieth year, South Los Angeles Stake led the Church, with 198 per cent, and this year the North Central States Mission was highest, with 110 per cent. The General Board extends to every faithful, devoted Magazine representative, in all the stakes and missions, wards and branches, its heartfelt thanks and appreciation for their united efforts and their outstanding achievement. 375 STAKE WARD MISSION MISSION DISTRICT MISSION BRANCH Honors for Highest Ratings South Los Angeles (California) 198% Magazine Representative �- Dona Osborn South Gate Ward, South Los Angeles Stake (California) 306% Magazine Representative �- Marcella Carruth North Central States � 110% Magazine Representative � Margaret Abbott Maritime District, New England Mission � 144% Magazine Representative �- Ellen C.

Peterson; Vivian Mortensen; Chloe Meldrum; Erma McPhie; Fay Peterson; May Ward; Eva Hutchings, President, Sunset Manor Branch Relief Society. Sister Call reports: "In our stake is a wonderful group of sisters conducting a branch Relief Society at the Sunset Manor rest home. Relief Society has brought new meaning and purpose into the lives of the sisters in the home. At Christmas time, the officers of this organization wanted the sisters to feel that they were doing something for someone else. A beautiful quilt was made, typical of Relief Society, and presented to the stake Relief Society president, to be given to the Eastern States Mission in honor of their Stake Presicant Roy W. Doxey, who is a former mission president of that mission. The presentation of the quilt to Sister Call for this purpose was a beautiful spiritual occasion, with several of the sisters spontaneously expressing their gratitude for Relief Society and the love they feel for one another." 387 May 1967 Idaho State University Stake (Pocatello, Idaho) Relief Society Leadership Meeting, November 1966 Left to right: Joyce Craig work director; Sherry Van Orden, cultural refinement class leader; Jane Nielsen, visiting teacher message leader; Diane Perry, spiritual living class leader; Kay Bacon, homemaking leader; Sandra Pratt, social relations class leader; Elizabeth Godfrey, organist; Carolyn Palmer, Secretary-Treasurer; Bessy Beal, Counselor; Judy Walsh, Counselor; Carol D.

The purpose of the displays was to present ideas for use in the ward homemaking meetings. There was also a display for each of the other lesson departments, all of which were beautifully arranged to call attention to the objectives of the various lesson courses. President Robert E. Thompson of the Idaho State University Stake, asked that the displays be set up also for the stake quarterly conference, in order that the stake members might observe and be aware of the opportunities of Relief Society." North Davis Stake (Utah) Makes Magazine Subscription Record January 7, 1967 Back row, standing, left to right: Susan Nelson, President, North Davis Stake Relief Society; LaLon Reid, First Counselor; Vera Thurgood, Second Counselor; sixth from the left: Helen Barber, former stake Magazine representative, who has served for twelve years, under three stake Relief Society presidents; at the left, in the front row, Ardell Stoker, new stake Magazine representative. Sister Nelson reports: "The North Davis Stake has been on the Magazine Honor Holl for twelve years, many times reaching a 100 per cent goal. In 1965, with ten wards, we reached 103 per cent, and in 1966, with twelve wards, our record was 105 per cent, with a membership of 881 and 937 subscriptions. This record was accomplished through the diligent work of ward Magazine representatives, supported by stake and ward presidents. On December 11, 1966, North Davis Stake was divided, making the new Sunset Stake." Lehi Stake (Utah) Visiting Teachers Honored at Convention November 4, 1966 Leah M. Sabey, President, Lehi Stake Relief Society, reports: "Our visiting teacher convention was held November 4, 1966, in our stake center. It was a very successful and inspirational program, under the direction of Norma Powell, stake visiting teacher message leader, assisted by her ward leaders and members of the stake board. We are grateful for the services of our dear visiting teachers, for the sweet spirit of sisterhood they have, for their love and devotion, and their acts of kindness and charity to the sisters of our stake. The picture represents all the sisters in the stake who have served twenty-five years or more as visiting teachers. Four sisters were absent when the picture was taken: This group of sisters represents 1200 years of service. "Copies of 'Out of the Best Books' (Volume 2) were given to Cedar Valley Ward and to Lehi Sixth Ward for having the highest per cent of their visiting teachers in attendance at the convention. Light refreshments were served to nearly 300 visiting teachers and ward presidencies in attendance." 388 HO ORR Re May 1967 Ashley Stake (Utah) Singing Mothers Present Music for QuaKene Conference October 16, 1966 Sixth from the left, in the front row (in dark dress): Irene C. Lloyd, member General Board of Relief Society; to her left Gae R. Johnson, President, Ashley Stake Relief Society; Donna Dee Smith, organist; Eloise C. Adams, chorister. Sister Johnson reports: "The Ashley Stake Singing Mothers presented the music for three sessions of stake quarterly conference, and are preparing to render the special music for the dedication of the new stake center. There are 103 sisters in the chorus, the largest in the history of the stake. It was truly an inspiration to see this large group all dressed in their white blouses and black skirts, with red ribbon roses as corsages, made in the homemaking meetings of the various wards. The spirit of the Lord was truly felt as the sisters sang the closing song 'Teach Me, O Lord.' " Guatemala � El Salvador Mission, Guatemala District One Singing Mothers Present Music for Special Relief Society Conference, November 8, 1966 At the right in the second row: Hilda Y.

Sharp of the General Board of Relief Society was the special visitor. This chorus also provided lovely music in three parts for the district conference of Guatemala the previous month. Sister Laura de Echeverria (sixth from the right in the front row, wearing a white sweater) is eighty-four years old, and very active in Guatemala Branch Ten, and in the district. She also made the long trek to the Arizona Temple with the excursion from the Guatemala-El Salvador Mission in 1965 and 1966. This chorus of Singing Mothers is representative of others in the mission who provide music for special occasions during the year." Oahu Stake (Hawaii) Relief Society Holds First Visiting Teachers Convention October 22, 1966 Left to right: Lois Swapp, First Counselor; Anne Rivers, President; Hilda Behling, Second Counselor; Misayo Kekauoha, Secretary-Treasurer. Sister Rivers reports: "A successful visiting teachers convention was held in the Oahu Stake, October 22, 1966. The theme 'The Work of the Lord Begins in the Home' was well portrayed by several speakers, including President Howard B. Stone of Oahu Stake; by songs rendered by the Singing Mothers; and by the film 'Unto the Least of These.' Sister Alta Barney was honored for forty years of service as a visiting teacher. Each member in attendance was presented with an orchid corsage. After the convention, the stake board served refreshments. "The Oahu Stake Relief Society board is unique in that the president is Samoan; the first counselor is Caucasian; the second counselor is Hawaiian; and the secretary-treasurer is Japanese�which proves that the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is for all peoples, and that they can and do work together in love and harmony." 390 May 1967 Mount Ogden Stake (Utah) Singing Mothers Present Music for Quarterly Conference, August 21, 1966 Front center, left to right: chorister Roka Raymond and organist Marian Rich. Ninth from the left in the long row, in front: Edvenia J. Malan, President, Mount Ogden Stake Relief Society. Sister Malan reports: '"The sisters were diligent in preparing the music for this conference. The working women practiced in the evenings, while the daytime Relief Society sisters practiced in the afternoons. Two lovely numbers were presented: 'Labor of Love,' by Joan Doxey, and 'A New Day Dawned,' by Ivy Huish Jones. Other songs were 'Come Ye Blessed,' and 'Jesus Savior Pilot Me,' with violin accompaniment." Oklahoma Stake, Clinton Branch Bazaar December 3, 1966 Left to right: Counselor Vivian Packer; President Esther Slater; Counselor Lorri Carlsen. Regina S. Brinkerhoff, President, Oklahcma Stake Relief Society, reports: 'We feel that this small branch developed a unique way of creating interest in their bazaar and carrying it to a conclusion. The branch consists of only fourteen members over a widely scattered area, with the meetings held in their new chapel at Clinton, Oklahoma. "The story of the bazaar really began in the fall of 1965, when a dinner was given, to which the husbands were invited. A short program was given, and each sister brought an article which she thought would be appropriate to make in quantities for a bazaar planned for the autumn of 1966. "The articles consisted of aprons, pillowcases, stuffed toys, crocheted articles, tea towels, and handicrafts. Women coming into the branch since then have added their talents in this, as well as in other ways. Some of the women who felt they were more experienced in cooking, furnished baked goods, candies, and jams for the bake sale held along with the bazaar.", Mount Graham Stake (Arizona) Relief Society Board at Leadership Meeting September 16, 1966 Front row, left to right: Hermione Kempton, chorister; Orlena Maloy, visiting teacher message leader; Orilla Carpenter, homemaking leader; Carolyn David, organist; Flora John, Magazine representative. Second row, left to right: Lenora Claridge, cultural refinement class leader;. Ruth Brinkerhoff, social relations class leader; Laurel Ellsworth, Counselor; Millie Kelly, President; Annie Larson, Counselor. Pearl Kempton, spiritual living class leader, and Lenna Jones, SecretaryTreasurer, were not present when the picture was taken. Sister Kelly reports: "An all-day leadership meeting was enjoyed by all ward homemaking leaders and presidencies. Each ward had a beautiful display in the 'Homemaker's Paradise' of arts and crafts, quilts, handwork, and sewing. There were fifteen tables, one for each ward, and one from the stake, displaying the talents of the women. Two demonstrations were given. A beautiful feeling of sharing was felt among the sisters. At noon the stake board members were hostesses at a lovely luncheon. "The visual aids shown in the picture were used to point the way to happiness, as each woman travels the Relief Society route by attending and participating in every meeting. "A booklet entitled 'The Happiness Way' was given to each sister as she entered. After the opening exercises, 'The Happiness Way,' written by Ruth Brinkerhoff, was presented." 392 HAPPINESS THE LESSON DEPARTMENT HOMEMAKING Development Through Homemaking Education Dr. Eleanor Jorgensen Discussion III-�-Summer Months Sewing Course Northern Hemisphere: Second Meeting, August 1967 Southern Hemisphere: January 1968 ' Objective: To realize the importance that correct hemming procedures have INTRODUCTION Regardless of what fashion dictates, the exact level of the hemline should be determined by whatever is most becoming to the individual and is reasonably harmonious with current styles. The importance of a _ goodlooking hem cannot be overemphasized. Therefore, a quality, standard-looking hem: 1. Is inconspicuous from the right side. 2. Is uniform in depth, and neat on the wrong side. 3. Is wide enough to provide enough weight so it will hang well. 4. Is an even distance from the floor. 5. Is stitched approximately 14" apart (except rolled hem), with stitches being uniformly spaced, loose, and inconspicuous. 6. Is smooth and flat. 7. Is free from pleats and tucks in a circular hem, thus having extra ful- 394 in achieving a quality looking garment. Ness controlled by easing and shrinking. 8. Is free from over-pressing, and pressed with correct grain direction. 9. Is hemmed using the appropriate finish for the fabric and garment style. General Procedures in Preparing Hems 1. Mark hem, placing pins or chalk marks about 3" apart on the desired hemline. 2. Turn up hem on marked hemline, and press fold lightly. 3. Measure desired depth from fold. Trim off excess. Fabric. 4. Eliminate bulk at seams by trimming off about 1/4," from seam allowances between marked hemline and cut edge. 5. Dispose of fullness in gored or circular cut garments. 6. Determine the appropriate hem finish. 7. Pin hem flat (except for roll hem), placing pins at right angles to hem; sew, using either flat hemming where edge of hem is stitched flat to the garment, or invisible hemming where stitches are taken between the hem and the garment. Depth of Hem is determined by the amount of flare in the garment and the weight of the fabric. In most fabric weights, a straight cut skirt should have a 2" to 3" hem, while a gored or circular cut garment has a 114" to 2" hem. A full straight skirt of sheer fabric, however, may have a 3" to 7" hem as part of the design, whereas in a circular cut sheer garment, the hem should be narrow, about 14". Handling Fullness. Unless the garment has a straight cut skirt, the lower edge will be fuller than the place where it will be hemmed. Therefore, fullness must be drawn in and distributed evenly so that it lies flat against the skirt. Sew around the hem 14" below raw edge, using a slightly longer machine stitch. Pin hem to garment at seams and at center of each panel, and again between centers and seams, if necessary. Draw up bobbin thread with pin between these points until the raw edge fits the width of the garment. Remove pins and place a piece of heavy paper inside hem, then press or shrink out fullness, always remembering to press in the direction of the lengthwise grain. (Figure 1) Stay-Stitching Plus, another method for eliminating fullness, crowds the threads of the fabric together. Press a pleat into the area where fullness appears. (This is used only as. A marking device to show where =o staystitching plus is needed and is not stitched down as a pleat.) Through a single thickness of fabric, make a line of stitching 14"' below the cut edge while pressing the index finger of the right hand against the pressure foot. As sewing is continued, the fabric piles up against the finger and forms gathers. The harder one presses, the tighter the gathers will be. Release the fabric and repeat the process all around the edge until fullness has been held in. Hem Finishes There are many hem finishes and hemming stitches for dress and skirt hems. Since it is impossible to list all types here, only a few of the more commonly used ones will be given. Lesson Department A. Turned and Stitched Hem (For cottons and other light or mediumweight fabrics. 1. Turn under raw edge of hem 14'; machine stitch close to top fold. ~2.~ Fase in fullness on flare cut garments. 3. Pin hem, matching seams. 4. Slant hemming, vertical hemming, or the slip-stitch may be used to fasten hem to garment. For narrower hems, machine-stitching on folded edge can be omitted. A' neater appearance results when the slip-stitch is used, spacing the stitches approximately 3%" apart. (Figure 2) B. Machine Blind Hem (For children's clothes and dresses made from medium-weight cottons.) It resembles the turned and stitched hem, except that it is done entirely on the machine, using the regular pressure foot. It is a quick and easy method to use on a straight skirt, but can be done equally well on a circular skirt, providing the excess fullness has been eased in first. 1. Press the marked hemline fold; measure hem depth. 2. Turn under raw edge %'', press, pin. (Figure 3) 3. Fold entire hem back against right side of garment, extending hem edge about 1/16" beyond garment fold. 4. Lengthen machine stitch to 10 to 12 stitches per inch. 5. Place hem next to machine and begin stitching on the extended edge. Sew 5 to 7 stitches, then pivot fabric slightly so that one stitch can be taken into folded edge of garment; pivot fabric again and continue stitching along extended edge 5 to 7 more stitches. Repeat until hem is completed. (Figure 4) Unfold hem and press. To insure even stitching, keep garment fold an equal distance (1/16') from extended edge. To prevent a tucked or puckered look at the right side, make sure the one stitch which goes into the garment fold is kept as close to this fold as possible. C. Tailors Hem (For heavy and medium-weight fabrics) 1. Machine stitch a line 44" from cut edge.

Pin at right angles. 3. Do inside hemming by folding hem back so that the pinked edge extends and the fold of the garment is even with the machine-stitching on the hem edge. A _ slant-stitch, slipstitch, or catch-stitch may be used, taking stitches on hem side through machine stitching and picking up one thread on garment fold. (Figure 5) Keep stitching loose. D. Seam Tape (For medium and heavy-weight fabrics, also fabrics which ravel easily. Not recommended on sheer fabrics) 1. Use rayon seam binding (woven edge, 1%' wide) which has been preshrunk. On circular skirts, shape tape to form a slight curve by pressing. 2. Pin seam tape to hem, lapping over cut edge 14". Avoid pulling tape too tight. (Excess fullness is removed from circular hems before tape is pinned into place.) 3. Machine stitch close to edge of tape, keeping tape an even width from hemline fold. Press stitched tape, inserting paper between hem and garment. 4. Pin hem at right angles. 5. Hand hem tape to garment, using invisible hemming. Fold garment back over hem so that the tape extends 1/16" above fold. Insert fine needle into garment, picking up a single yarn, then take a very small stitch into tape about 14" away from the first stitch. The next stitch is taken directly below the point where the stitch was made in the tape. Keep stitching loose. From right side of tape, it appears to be a _ running stitch, spaced %" apart. (Figure 6) Lesson Department E. Rolled Hem (For circular skirts of sheer fabric, silk scarves, etc.) 1. Trim fabric to within 4" of marked hemline. _2. Fold raw edge 14%" toward body of garment. 3. Insert a fine needle with single thread up under the fold to hide the knot. 4. Pick up thread in the garment just below raw edge and directly below where needle was inserted in fold, then slip needle back through fold, taking up the next stitch, which is spaced 1%"" away. 5. Repeat step 4 until several stitches have been taken, then pull the thread tight to form the roll. The stitching at the fold rolls over to meet the stitching at the raw edge, thus concealing the thread inside rolled hem. (Figure 7) F. Hem in Pleat (For skirts having a seam on the inside fold of the pleat) Method A (Medium-weight fabrics) 1. Measure hem depth; clip seam allowance at top of hem. 2. Press seam open from clipped point to lower edge of hem, grading seam from marked hemline to lower edge. 3. Turn up hem on marked line and finish.. 4. Stitch through folded edge of pleat. (Figure 8) Method B (Bulky fabrics) 1. Leave seam of pleat open about 8" up from cut edge of skirt. 2. Hem garment, making sure hems match on each side of opened seam. 3. Sew opened seam through the hem. 4. Turn seam at lower edge to form a mitered corner.
