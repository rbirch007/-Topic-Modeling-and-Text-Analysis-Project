Those Who Endureth to the End �What may well be called an adage is this statement of truth: "The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, but to him that endureth to the end." To endure is to maintain the capability of holding out, of lasting, of continuing in the same state without weakening or perishing. It is the power to continue under pain, hardship, discouragement, suffering, without being overcome. History is replete with goals that have been realized and battles that have been won, not by those who made a brilliant beginning or an impressive first stand, but by those who had the power to remain firm, patiently to overcome obstacles, to be constant in their efforts. The scriptures offer a priceless blessing to those who accept the: gospel of Christ and who endure President Belle S. Spafford _ to the end. Not only once do the scriptures make reference to this, [Address Delivered at the but a number of times. One of General Session of the Relief: j Society Annual General numerous passages dealing with Conference, this admonition and its blessing September 27, 1967] reads as follows: "And, if you keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life, which gift is the 804 greatest of all the gifts of God" (D&C 14:7). Kternal life is a gift every Latter-day Saint worthy of the name desires to obtain. Yet in this complex world of trouble and testing, and handicapped as we are with human weaknesses and imperfections, it is not always easy to endure throughout life. To do so requires firm faith, strong convictions, sterling character. Failure often comes to us due to our insensitiveness to the fact that faulty attitudes have developed, and behavior counter to the will of God has gradually been adopted. Then, we tend to justify these without being aware that they are adversely affecting our lives. May I relate an interesting experience. Authorization, as many of you know, has been given by the Brethren for Relief Societies, under specified circumstances, to be organized in nursing or residential homes for older sisters. One day I visited such a Relief Society. The members were between seventy-five and ninety years of age. They were ambulatory, bright of mind, and enthusiastic over their Society. The lesson was from the Doctrine and Covenants and was followed by testimony bearing. The sisters contributed intelligently to the lesson discussions. Their offerings reflected a knowledge of Church doctrine and familiarity with the teachings of the gospel, as well as rich life experiences. It was a delightful meeting. Then came the testimony period. Each sister who spoke, one by one, prayed that she would endure to the end. As I contemplated their intelligent understanding of the gospel as demonstrated in the lesson disThose Who Endureth to the End cussion, and as I considered how late in life it was for most of them, I thought, why would they pray that they might endure to the end? Surely they have already proved themselves. �Later, however, in private conversation with some of them, I was made aware that they were not entirely above reproach; that they had a tendency to excuse themselves for failures to comply with the laws of the gospel because of age and the circumstances of their lives. These are a few interesting comments made by these sisters as I talked with them: One sister said, ""We have sacrament meeting here at the home, as well as Relief Society, but I never go to sacrament meeting. I am too old to be preached to." I inquired, ''Don't you feel a need to partake of the sacrament?" "No," the sister indifferently replied, "I don't think it matters at my age." Another sister said, "I want to move to a little better home, I have enough money to do so. I have no one on whom to spend my money but myself. My family does not need it, and I am no longer interested in doing things for others that cost money. I don't even pay tithing. I don't think the Lord expects it of one my age." Still another sister, who was drinking tea as I called, said, "I almost live on tea. As a younger woman, you couldn't have hired me to drink a cup of tea, but I don't think it will be held against me now." Yet another said, as we heard footsteps near the door, '"'I hope 805 November 1967 that's not my daughter. She only comes because she fears criticism if she doesn't do so. She has very little love for me, and I have very little for her." One more comment: "I seem to be growing weaker every day, suffering as I do with pain. I used to have the elders administer to me, but I don't believe in it anymore." 'Pttendance at sacrament meeting, partaking of the sacrament, renewing one's covenants, the payment of tithing, observance of the Word of Wisdom, love of family, Priesthood administration �all basic laws of the gospel� had been abandoned by one or the other of these sisters with a feeling of justification; yet each had earnestly prayed that she might endure to the end. Sympathetic as we may be toward these sisters and toward their circumstances, and understanding as we may be of their actions, yet we must recognize that with clear minds they were justifying the nonobservance of God's laws. I am led to ask also, "Has the Lord ever set a retirement age with regard to keeping his commandments?" Nor is it during the later years of life only that people grow careless. During the younger years there are those who violate their covenants, weaken in defense of right, disobey commandments which they know to be important, and rationalize with regard to their non-allegiance to Church teachings. Social pressures, the enticements of fashion, the desire to be like others whom one would cultivate but who do not have the same light to guide them, adver- 806 sity, unfulfilled expectations, disappointment�all of these sometimes press hard upon one and break him down at a weak point, opening the door for Satan to step in. Sometimes we engage in behavior counter to the teachings of the Church with the feeling, 'I know it's not right, but I don't intend to make a practice of this. Once or twice won't hurt." The once or twice, however, soon become more frequent until the behavior develops into a habit. Also, as one weakens at one point, it becomes easy to weaken at another. I ask, '"'Wouldn't it be easy for one who discontinues regular attendance at sacrament meetings to lose sight of the importance of keeping the Sabbath day holy?" I fear that it would. Thus, error subtly creeps into our lives, and the promised blessings for those who endure to the end are in jeopardy. How, then, may we avoid the pitfalls which lead us away from the straight and narrow path? How may we muster the strength that will enable us to endure to the end? First, I would suggest continuous Church activity to the full measure of one's opportunities and capacities. I would recommend a study of the scriptures with meditation upon the promised blessings of obedience to the respective commandments. What is to be more desired than the blessings promised by the Lord in section 89 of the Doctrine and Covenants for obedience to the Word of Wisdom: And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones; And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures; And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint. And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them (D&C 89: 18-21). Consider the promise to the tithe payer found in Malachi: Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it (Malachi 3:10). For those who must be convinced through personal experience, let them heed the words of Alma: But behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words (Alma 32:27). I remind you that spiritual strength comes through worthily partaking of the sacrament. This we do as we attend the meeting required of us by the Lord�the sacrament meeting. Would it not be well occasionally to let our minds dwell upon the blessings rather than upon the adversities of our lives? Let us consider the countless times our prayers have been answered against the few times when the Lord in his wisdom may have given a negative answer. Those Who Endureth to the End Let us avoid the tendency to justify disobedience to God's commandments because of untoward personal circumstances just as we would avoid a plague. It may be useful, also, to remember that strength grows with practice and that the Lord helps those who earnestly seek his help through fasting and prayer. Regardless of the adversities of life and the difficulties encountered in striving faithfully to endure, success can be achieved; people can overcome obstacles, and they can be constant in their faith and in their obedience to the laws of the Father. The Bible gives us an impressive example in the account of Joseph, son of Jacob. Joseph was born when his loving father was in his old age. He found himself, through the chicanery of his brothers, finally living in Egypt in the court of Potiphar. Imagine this boy sent by his father on a mission to his brothers, advancing toward them in all the unsuspecting openness of brotherly affection, finding them to be his unnatural assailants, consumed with hatred toward him and determined to rid themselves of him. A Bible commentary says, It is impossible that mere envy... Or the doting partiality of their common father could have goaded them on to such a pitch of frenzied resentment Their hatred of Joseph must have been produced by a dislike... Of his excellencies which made his character and conduct a constant censure upon theirs. In the Egyptian household, the household of an idolator, the boy had to contend with strange conditions. Though separated from 807 November 1967 his father, Jacob, he was not separated from his Heavenly Father. He faithfully and zealously served God and kept his commandments. This sometimes brought him earthly advantages. At other times, however, it brought him extreme suffering�even imprisonment. (Genesis 41:14). But the Lord blessed Joseph all the days of his life because of his faithfulness, and through him he blessed his father's household as well. Joseph's words in remonstrance to Potiphar's wife when she made the most infamous advance a woman can make toward a man, was characteristic of his response to every evil that beset his path; ""How then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?" (Genesis 39:9). Joseph lived eighty years after his elevation to the Chief Power of Egypt, giving continuous proof of his faith and the assurance of the promise of the Lord to those who keep his commandments. His entire life was characterized by righteous professions supported by conscientious and righteous conduct. In the New Testament we learn of Paul�tirst a persecutor of the Christians, then a devoted follower of Christ, a teacher, a missionary, an apostle�who at the close of life could say with confidence: I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith; Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing (II Timothy 4:7-8). The Book of Mormon gives us many striking examples of men 808 who kept the faith and endured to the end. Lehi, Jacob, Mormon, Enos�with whom the Lord made a covenant in behalf of the Lamanite people because of his faithfulness�Abinadi, and others. May I refresh your minds with regard to Abinadi. Abinadi was a Nephite prophet whom the Lord raised up in the land of NephiLehi to reprove the wicked people of King Noah for their sins. His bold denunciations of their abominations ended in his being cast into prison. The evil priests clamored to slay him, And they stood forth and attempted to lay their hands on him; but he withstood them, and said unto them: Touch me not, for God shall smite you if ye lay your hands upon me, for I have not delivered the message which the Lord sent me to deliver... Therefore, God shall not suffer that I shall be destroyed at this time (Mosiah 13: 2-3). The scripture tells us further they had no power to slay him because he was protected by divine power. In his humility, Abinadi reveals his complete surrender to the work of the Lord in these words: But I finish my message; and then it matters not whether I go, if it so be that I am saved (Mosiah 13:9). Faithful unto martyrdom, surely the promise of salvation made to those who endure to the end would be the blessing of Abinadi. This dispensation, too, offers many examples of those who have had the strength to endure in the face of great trials and suffering. To each of our minds there come examples of women, as well as men, some of them simple, unpretentious souls; others, those hold- ing places of prominence and trust. Let us keep these faithful souls in remembrance as an ensample to us at all times. They were not fictitious characters from an imaginary past. They were human beings living in the world of reality, just as are we. Let each of us strive to be among those who remain faithful. True, it is hard to resist temptations, to rise above trouble and keep our faith strong. It is easy to succumb to those evils that temporarily comfort the flesh, particularly in our declining Those Who Endureth to the End years; it is not always easy to remain constant and to avoid the human weakness of justifying the error of our ways. But this, we can and must do if we would enjoy the blessings promised by the Lord to those who endure to the end. How wonderful it would be, what a good world this would be if each one of us would so live as to be able to say at the close of life as did Paul, "I have finished my course, I have kept the faith." That we may earnestly work toward this end, I sincerely pray. La THE SISTERS GATHERED Gillian G.

No royal gathering of ancient rhyme, Was more enriched than this, of modern time. Humbly the sisters gathered, widely called, To listen to great teaching�quiet, enthralled, Then thrilled, as truly glorious voices sang In chorus�bell-like, hauntingly they rang. A strange, compelling spirit filled the air, A feeling most miraculous and rare, A sheen of almost brimming tears was found In many searching eyes the room around. A tide of loving feeling flowed their way As leading sisters stood to speak that day, And firm direction, like a challenging sword, Was heard from an apostle of the Lord. | know these things are so, for | was there� | testify to all the world, that here In precious England, on this lovely day The Spirit of the Lord held forceful sway.

The sisters gathered�we will come again. ~ y 809 November 1967 Security Amid Change Counselor Marianne C. Sharp {Address Delivered at the General Session of the Relief Society Annual General Conference, September 27, 1967] 810 A few weeks ago I carried the newspaper in to my husband. On the way I glanced at the headlines. I said to him, "The only thing that seems right in the world is the Church." Accidents, earthquakes, wars, raids, riots, strikes, robberies�they were all there to be seen at a glance. The same feeling comes over me when I read the so-called women's magazines. Everywhere are articles on unhappy marriages, birth control, abortions, drugs, and the personal lives of glamorous divorcees and their latest marriages. We have even had women write us and ask why the fiction in The Relief Society Magazine doesn't mirror these conditions in the world. In this' so-called changing world, men would have us believe that basic laws change, that what was. Considered moral in our grandparents' day is no longer in force, that changing conditions have changed the need for chastity and honesty, that the virtues are outmoded. Indicative of the prophecy that the wisdom of the wise should perish, is the statement attributed to a learned professor at Dartmouth who characterized the divinely inspired Constitution as 'a mudbank left by the receding tides of history" and said that it was left from the "era of the ox-drawn sledge." A Latter-day Saint knows that divine laws never change, the only change is the conduct of God's children toward the laws, their disobedience to God's laws. Edicts against promiscuity, the use of certain substances, and civil disobedience, among others, have been and will always be in force. As mothers, we need. To bulwark our children against these prevalent, loose and_ wicked thoughts and actions. We must be on the watchtower in our homes twenty-four hours a day. We must constantly pray for guidance and seek the counsel of the Priesthood in our efforts. With all that a mother must do, it would seem that each child should feel accepted and loved and secure in the love that his parents feel for each other and for him. It is an arduous task for a mother to maintain a loving attitude in spite of irritations and worries which come inevitably. One mother preserves her loving calmness through snatching just a few minutes to read a few verses of scripture. She says there is nothing which calms her feelings and changes her attitudes so quickly as this does. As the children have grown older and noticed her reading, it has caused the scriptures to take on greater significance in their daily living. President George Albert Smith once said in a talk, "There is no happiness worthy of the name that does not come as a result of obedience to a loving Father who has said to us "This is the pathway, walk ye in it.' There is Security Amid Change safety for us only on the Lord's side of the line" (The Handbook of the Restoration, page 601). A child reared in a loving home easily learns that Heavenly Father loves him even more than his �earthly parents do, and accepts the fact that the Father's laws have only his eternal happiness in view. All too frequently are blazoned the results of disobedience for one who stepped over into Satan's territory, on his side of the line. This comparison has meaning in the child's world. It helps also for a mother to confide about an example in her own life when she nearly became disobedient and almost stepped into the devil's territory, and how thankful she is that she resisted. Of the time when she wanted to go to a movie at night 'and rebelliously stayed home only to learn the next morning that the roof had collapsed from the weight of snow and killed most of the audience. A testimony that Jesus is the Christ is the supreme gift a mother would strive, above all, to have her child possess. From the time he is a babe in arms she can sing to him of Jesus and train him while a lisping child to kneel at her side and pray to him. The love the child will feel for the Savior will be a potent force in helping her to teach him the meaning of repentance for his childish misdeeds. The knowledge of Jesus' love and joy when the child does right, will help him to tell the truth and be honest. As a child approaches baptism, a mother should have taught him the meaning of it and the great gift he will receive of the Holy Ghost. When he becomes a teen- 811 November 1967 ager and, later, when he may leave the home entirely, the realization of the possession of the Holy Spirit will comfort and bless him. He may recall his mother's teachings of the preservation of Wilford Woodruff's life many times through his instant obedience to the promptings of the Spirit. The man, the woman will have learned to obey the still, small voice which says, "Do this; do that''�''Don't do that." This training of a child presupposes that a mother will have managed, in some way or another, if her family is large, to have received the confidences of each child alone each day. This will keep open the communication between them. Today, it may be what the schoolteacher said to the child before recess. In the years ahead it may be how a friend stole in a store, or began to smoke. Often having a child pray alone with the mother over a difficult situation may bring about a needed softened attitude. And with it all, must be set an example for work, both mental and physical with the child working along with the mother. 'Thou shalt not be idle' is a dictum of the Lord as is "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread." Work is the great blessing and even in times of dire distress it will bring comfort and _ satisfaction. As we read The Book of Mormon, we discover the feeling of hopelessness the righteous felt as wickedness prevailed. The Prophet Mormon, when only fifteen, was leading the Nephite armies, but unsuccessfully, because of their degradation and wickedness. He wrote, "But behold this my joy was vain, for their sorrowing was not unto repentance, because of the goodness of God; but it was rather the sorrowing of the damned, because the Lord would not always suffer them to take happiness in sin"? (Mormon 2:13). As; mothers today, we must not feel discouraged nor hopeless. We have been told that this gospel will not be given to another people, and we know that great spirits have been reserved to come forth in this day. Recently, a modern day prophet said that while conditions in the world grew worse, the Church would continue to carry on its work at the same time. Instead, the mothers of the Church must rejoice, rejoice to be alive in these great last days, rejoice in the goodness of their sons and daughters whom they have reared in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. May we all be that kind of a mother whose children have the only gift of security there is�the WITH CHIVALRY Iris W. Schow When bird and sun are moving south once more, And equinoctial storms have come and gone, The trees, like Raleigh, doff their brilliant coats And lay them down for us to walk upon. Church, I pray. 812 Counselor Louise W. Madsen [Address Delivered at the General Session of the Relief Society Annual General Conference, September 27, 1967] �Two things the Lord requires if one is to obtain the fullness of his blessings. ''Behold, the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind" (D&C 64:34). The heart, according to the un- �derstanding received from studying the words of Christ, his prophets and apostles, is the repository of that which is good, the storehouse of those thoughts which bring the deepest meditation. Those things which are heard but not fully understood are stored in the heart to ponder, as did Mary. When the events leading to the birth of the Son were unfolded she 'pondered them in her heart" (Luke 2:19). The pure heart is the dwelling place of the Holy Ghost. 'Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart" (D&C 8:2). This is the promise given to those who ask in faith, with an honest heart, believing that knowledge will be received. The heart is not only a repository and a storehouse but it is a motive power. "With my whole heart I have sought thee; O let me not wander from thy commandments," the Psalmist sings (Psalms 119:10). Love, which is described as the greatest thing in the world, the basis of the first and greatest commandment, is centered in the heart. "I have you in my heart' (Phil. 1:7), Paul writes to his beloved people, the Philippians. Compassion, the desire to express love by serving others, springs from the heart. The heart rejoices in righteousness or is saddened by unrighteousness. It is the heart which 813 ow SS November 1967 guides the soul to repentance, the sorrowing heart which seeks ex- -piation for sin. It is the heart filled to overflowing which leads to expressions of gratitude. The heart is the seat of courage, of nobleness. It is in its chambers the spirit of forgiveness is found. The heart reacts to the appeal of the gospel; it feels the warmth of God's word and the joy of his work. Faith is believing with the heart. Conversely, sadly, the opposite can be true. Sometimes the heart is filled with evil, crowding out the good, the clean, the joyous, the right. Only the Lord knows what is actually in the _ heart. "But the Lord said unto Samuel," as he sought to find a successor to Saul, "Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature for the Lord seeth not as man seeth, for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart" (I Sam. 16:7). This, then, is the heart the Lord requires, the pure, humble, reverent, compassionate, forgiving, loving heart; the repository of his words, the storehouse of truths for meditations, the motivator of righteous action. "Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength, and my redeemer," we may pray as did David (Psalms 19:14). A willing mind the Lord also requires; willing to accept his teachings, to cast out doubt, to do his work. A teachable mind, open, ready, desiring to learn, is mandatory. A strong mind, filled with the strength of knowing the 814 truth, and one which does not "weary of well doing" (D&C 64: 32) is necessary. A tireless mind which accepts the commandment, "Wherefore, if ye believe me, ye will labor while it is called today" (D&C 64:25), is required. A mind with vision, ready to receive the life-enriching gospel, able to see with clarity the wisdom of dedication to the will of the Lord, will respond to the whispering of the "still, small voice," the burning within the breast, and the urging of the spirit. The heart and willing mind signify obedience. That which is required by the Lord of us living inthese latter days is whole-hearted, whole-souled, whole-minded obedience. Perhaps the greatest willingness the Lord requires is willingness to be obedient. One shows his devotion and dedication by obedience. The element of sacrifice enters into a contemplation of obedience, a willingness to sacrifice immediate pleasures and desires for ultimate blessings. The grace of submission to divine will, to authority, is gained when one can say, "Lord, what wilt thou have me do?" (Acts 9:6). His chosen people are the obedient, chosen because of their willingness to obey. Know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts; if thou seek him he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off forever (I Chron. 28:9). This admonition should be our guide. This the Lord requires. "How many. Winters must' have come to REPORT AND OFFICIAL INSTRUCTIONS President Belle S. Spafford [Delivered at the Officers Meeting of the Relief Society Annual General Conference, September 27, 1967.] �It is with deep appreciation for the devoted efforts of Relief Society leaders and members alike, and with thankfulness to our Heavenly Father for his blessings, that I bring to you today a brief report of the growth and general accomplishments of Relief Society during the calendar year 1966, together with a few instructions, recommendations, and cautions from the General Board. Practically all aspects of the work of the Society during the last calendar year showed gratifying gains. In the few instances where decreases were recorded, they may be explained by changing circumstances or changes in procedures. For example, the number of visits made to families in need by ward Relief Society presidents under the direction of the respective bishops decreased by more than 10,000. Undoubtedly this was due to the fact that emphasis is now being placed by the General Priesthood Welfare Commit- 816 tee on the initial visit being made by the bishops themselves, with only follow-up visits being made by Relief Society presidents. MEMBERSHIP AND ATTENDANCE At the close of 1966, there were 301,248 sisters enrolled in the Society, an increase of 14,428, each of whom may grow in testimony, be strengthened in service to her family, her sisters, her Church, and her community, through her participation in the program of the Society. In spite of the demands made upon the time of women today, particularly women who are employed outside their homes, and regardless of the enticements that would draw the sisters away from Relief Society, the average attendance at regular Relief Society meetings increased by over 5,000. Second session Relief Societies, no doubt, were an important factor in the increase. SECOND SESSION RELIEF SOCIETIES Sisters, the growing number of wards holding second session Relief Societies leads us to offer a few suggestions with regard to them. They should be undertaken only with the bishop's full approval following his being fully apprised of all that is involved; 1. E., the use of the meetinghouse; the additional requirements that must be made of the regular Relief Society officers; the number of women who would benefit and who otherwise would be unable to attend Relief Society meetings. Second session Relief Societies are no longer an experiment. They have proved successful in countless wards. Evening _ sessions should be regularly scheduled as to day and time of meeting, with the convenience of the sisters who will attend being kept in mind. The frequency of these sessions, if not held weekly, would be determined by the Relief Society presidency in consultation with the bishop. LEADERSHIP IN RELIEF SOCIETY Throughout the Church, there is today a total of 6,809 organized Relief Society units�stake, mission, mission district, ward, and branch Societies. This represents an increase of 147. There are 196,259 women holding leadership positions in these organizations. This is almost two-thirds of the total number of members. The latter part of May, the Relief Society Presidency and two other members of the General Board conducted three regional conferences in Great Britian under the direction of Elder Mark Report and Official Instructions KE. Petersen, as a special assignment. The leadership ability of the sisters evidenced at these conferences was impressive. They were poised, well-informed, gifted in their powers of expression, humble, and gracious. If this may be regarded as an index of Relief Society leadership strength�and I believe it may be so regarded� certainly our leadership training efforts are bearing good fruit. Leadership training, however, is a continuing matter in Relief Society since new members are continually coming into the Society. VISITING TEACHING The visiting teaching program continues to grow in size, to increase in importance, and to improve in quality. There were over 130,000 visiting teachers who made a total of 607,201 visits during 1966, over 100,000 visits in excess of one-half million. Of this number of visits, 8,875 were made to non-Latter-day Saint families at their request or as directed by the bishop. This indicates the appreciation which is felt for the visits of these sisters. In the stakes, an average of nine visits was made during the year to each family. Church-wide, the average was eight visits per family. If the program were fully functioning, there would have been twelve visits per family. We know, however, that circumstances over which we have no control make twelve visits annually per family extremely difficult, if not impossible of realization. We commend presidencies and visiting teachers alike for their excellent record. Letters from Relief Society presidents and comments from Priesthood leaders indicate that visiting 817 November 1967 teacher reports submitted by ward Relief Society presidents to bishops are growing more meaningful and helpful to bishops as they direct home teachers with regard to bringing families into activity in the Church. Visiting teacher meetings, of which approximately 40,000 were held during 1966�an increase of more than 1,000�are the main place to train women in quality teaching and significant reporting. We urge you to consider this with ward presidents in the presidents department of a forthcoming leadership meeting. EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM The educational courses continue as class involvement discussions dealing with a central gospel principle or truth, with amplifying material approved by the Church Correlation Committee. Approximately 24,000 women are serving as class leaders and doing highly commendable work. Education materials have been prepared and are available to accompany the 1967-68 courses of study. You have been advised regarding these in correspondence from the General Board. The booklet, "Special Lessons for Relief Society," Volume 4, for those requiring simplified lessons, is now available at a cost of $1.75. It will contain a continuation of the two courses, Lessons From the Book of Mormon, and Latterday Saint Church History only. The homemaking discussions, visiting teacher messages, and social relations lessons will be those printed in the Relief Society Magazine for the current year's education work. Volume 1 "Lessons for Indian -Relief Societies," 818 ($1.25), and Volume 2 ($1.75) and Volume 3 ($2.00) of "Special Lessons for Relief Society," continue to be available. HOMEMAKING PROGRAM The homemaking discussions for the forthcoming season entitled, '"'Development Through Homemaking Education," offer variety and interest for the woman who would maintain a financially well protected family and a happy home. Once again, the homemaking meeting continues as the second best attended meeting. The output of these meetings reflects the resourcefulness of homemaking leaders and the diligence of the sisters. There was a total of 1,362,000 articles completed in the homemaking meetings during 1966. Of this number, 828,000 were sewed articles, including quilts, clothing for men, women, and children, and household furnishings. There were 534,- 000 non-sewed articles made to add charm, beauty, and convenience to the home. THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE The Relief Society Magazine now published in English and Spanish, has a present circulation of 260,000 in the English edition and nearly 6,000 in the Spanish edition. The Relief Society Magazine is the official publication of the Society, but it should be in the home of every Latter-day Saint woman regardless of whether or not she is an enrolled member of Relief Society. COMPASSIONATE SERVICES The compassionate services continue to engage the time and energies of Relief Society sisters. For the first time in several years, the number of days of bedside nursing care increased. Approximately 2,000 eight-hour days of service were given over the previous year, bringing the total number of days care to 31,120. Figures for other types of compassionate service are equally gratifying. ' It is suggested that in assigning a Relief Society sister to bedside nursing care of a sick person or in arranging for such nursing care on a paid basis, that Relief Society presidents make sure the sister lS qualified for the service required. We suggest that presidents make use of the nurse lists in this connection. Where a patient requires lifting, we should make sure the sister assigned to the service has the necessary strength and skill to render the service without harm to herself or the patient. We would carefully consider the general health of a sister assigned to give bedside nursing care. We respond to bedside nursing needs in the spirit of willing service and loving sisterhood. At the same time, we safeguard, to the best of our abilities, the patient and the sister assigned to render the service by being informed with regard to the patient's needs, and also as to the qualifications and health condition of the sister to whom we assign the service. At no time would we deny bedside watchcare to the sick, for which most Relief Society sisters are qualified, but where actual handling of the patient is required and other special ministrations such as the giving of medications, we must recognize the importance of assigning the service to qualiReport and Official Instructions fied sisters. The homemaking discussion course outlined for the coming four summer meetings deals with home nursing, and will be helpful to you in preparing the sisters to care for the sick in the homes. SINGING MOTHERS PROGRAM The Singing Mothers program is moving forward with a high degree of success. We now have 3,601 choruses�an increase of 376, with over 50,000 sisters participating�an increase of 349. We are pleased to announce that an invitation has been extended by the National Broadcasting Company for the Singing Mothers from the New York-New Jersey area to provide a special Christ- | mas Eve program for the "Voices of Christmas" radio series. Keep this in mind and tune in to hear our Relief Society sisters sing under the leadership of Sister Ellen N. Barnes, a member of the General Board. SOCIAL ACTIVITIES The social activities of Relief Society are holding the interest of Relief Society members, and on the whole, are providing not only relaxation and delightful entertainment for the members, but are also providing development and utilization of their talents. This is as it should be. The General Board jooks with apprehension upon what appears to be a growing tendency on the part of Relief Society officers, to use paid entertainers who independently prepare and present their own programs at Relief Society social functions. Regardless of the nature and quality of such programs, paid entertainment is 819 November 1967 scarcely in keeping with the purposes or character of Relief Society, and such _ presentations wrest from the Relief Society president full control of what is presented. In addition, it needlessly reduces the Relief Society funds which are acquired through the labors of the members who themselves are entitled to the development incident to a Relief Society program. ~ BOOK REVIEWS AND LECTURE COURSES We also caution presidents with regard to book reviews as entertainment at social functions. The Cultural Refinement course offers monthly to the members the very best in literature, together with music and art. If upon occasion, however, a presidency feels that a book review would be enjoyed and the sisters would benefit from it at a social function, they must bear in mind that, as administrative officers, they have the responsibility to know the contents of the book, to jointly evaluate its possible acceptance by the members, and its possible influence upon them. Presidencies, in arranging for book reviews, must accept responsibility for knowing that the book does not present viewpoints or advocate action contrary to the standards of Relief Society and the teachings of the Church. We further call to the attention of Relief Society presidencies the ruling that Relief Society does not sponsor lectures or lecture courses, whether they be based on books or other subject matter, except as approved by the General Board and the Correlation Committee. Recent re- 820 ports reaching the General Board indicate that currently popular books on womanhood and related subjects and _ lecture courses based on such books are being sponsored by some Relief Societies counter to the General Board ruling. We are advised that the teachings in some of these books have proved very disturbing to some Relief Society members. We, therefore, admonish you to abide strictly by the General Board ruling. FINANCING STAKE BOARDS We commend Relief Society presidencies for the sound financial management of the respective Societies. In this connection, we mention particularly the resourcefulness and _ intelligence with which stake boards have adjusted to the plan whereby garment earnings no longer go into the Relief Society treasuries. This change, made two years ago, posed a challenge for stake Relief Society presidencies�a challenge that has been well and appropriately met. Occasionally, the question is asked as to whether a stake Relief Society may assess ward Relief Societies for financial help. In reply to this question, wards may help a stake financially by supporting a stake board sponsored fund-raising program (and I remind you that where this is expected of the wards, it is wise to involve the wards in the planning and presentation of the activity). The General Board sees a number of reasons why stake boards should not assess wards in order to meet their financial needs. For example, ward officers and members might not be amenable to such action, and this could interfere with the harmonious relationship between stake and ward officers; it would be difficult to assess all wards equitably, since all do not have the same size treasuries or earning capacities; it could bring criticism of stake board expenditures by ward workers who might disapprove of the manner in which the money was being spent by the stake and which they regard as actually being ward money. The General Board, therefore, advises against ward assessments. The financing of stake boards on college campuses is governed by the Priesthood leaders. CAMPUS BRANCH RELIEF SOCIETY LEADERSHIP Referring to campus branch Relief Societies, we are delighted with the acceptance of Relief Society by the young college women. Their understanding of the work, the quality of their efforts, and their intelligent lcadership are very promising for Relief Society. When they leave college and reside in your wards or branches, make use of their enthusiasm and abilities by bringing them into immediate activity. You will find the rewards to be great. PARTICIPATION IN SATURDAY EVENING SESSION - 1967 QUARTERLY CONFERENCES We wish at this time to commend the stake Relief Societies for the excellence of their participation in the Saturday evening session of the stake quarterly conferences during this year. The brethren visiting the conferences have brought to the General Report and Official Instructions Board excellent commendatory reports. NEW RECORDING AND REPORTING FORMS We remind you that the Relief Society year, together with other units of the Church, is now from September 1 to August 31, with reports being prepared accordingly. The only exception in Relief Society is the Magazine Honor Roll which will remain on a calendar year. The annual report for January 1 through August 31, 1967, was due in the General Board office September 20 from stakes and October 1 from missions. New ward and stake record books and visiting teacher report books providing for changes have been issued in fourteen languages, adapted to the needs of Societies in both Northern and Southern Hemispheres. We call your attention to changes in policies and record keeping procedures ircorporated in these books, and particularly those related to the new procedures of the Church for the preparation and presentation of permanent historical information. Extra copies of the instructions for both ward and stake record books are prepared in separate pamphlet form for the use of ward and stake Relief Society presidents. These may be ordered from the General Board Office for twenty-five cents each. Monthly reports are now required by Priesthood authorities from all Priesthood and auxiliary organizations, including Relief Society. All of these matters are already in effect and will be explained in the Secretary-Tyreasurers Department of this Conference. 821 November 1967 "HISTORY OF RELIEF SOCIETY" NOW AVAILABLE We hope you are already familiar with, enjoying, and making use of the new book, The History of Relief Society, available at the General Board office for $4. Per. Copy, postpaid. We urge every Relief Society to obtain a copy of this valuable history for organization use. Individual members will find this history valuable for their home libraries. RELIEF SOCIETY A YEAR-ROUND PROGRAM Sisters, let us dispel the concept of Relief Society being an eight-month program, with only one meeting each month during the summer months. Relief Society iS a year-round, continuous program of service, activity, and education, and it is day-by-day watchcare over our people. Visiting teaching, compassionate services, work on Church welfare projects, homemaking meetings, social activities, Singing Mothers activities, the garment distribution program, are not geared to a set number of consecutive months. They are year-round programs. Ours is a well-rounded program, designed to meet the needs of the sisters, the Church, and our people, generally, on a continuing basis. Let us keep it thus that the blessings of the Lord may abide with us continuously in our labors. TO "GIVE FOR" Elizabeth Cottam Walker Always | had heard it said '"'Forgive,'' and it had been a word my tongue spoke, my ear heard, But this word my heart rejected. Oh,!| had thought that! Forgave, but then in an unguarded hour forgotten angers assailed my power to forget, awakening old resentments. Why had! Failed? Forgetting is not forgiving � no one forgives who can recall an injury; forgiveness is an all possessing love, forgetfulness of self.! Must realize it is another's right to be forgiven. How great the grief the unforgiven carry; denying relief binds the unforgiving one forever. This | know, and this must | do � | must ''give for' to ''forgive''; give love for hatred, for to live with love is the Master's way of life. 822 � "Are you sure you don't want the package gift wrapped?" the clerk asked. We shook our heads. "We want to wrap it ourselves,"' Virginia said, and I blurted, "'because we want to look inside some more." The clerk chuckled and wrapped the gilded box in plain paper. We put our change on the counter, including the show ticket money Uncle Tim had given us, then took turns carrying our package home. We got it past the family and into our room without being noticed. Virginia set it on our bed and I started to untie the string. "Eillie, be careful. ['ll unwrap it,' Virginia said. She's two years older than I and thinks she's grown up. I sat on the edge of the bed. The Golden Bowl. A Alice Sabin "You're sitting too close, Ellie," she said, so I moved a couple of inches. When the package was opened, she folded back the crisp tissue paper, and there they were, gleaming at us�two_ golden bowls! In wonderment, I lifted one out of the box and Virginia picked up the other. They were a set of flower bowls. Mine 'had a fluted edge that turned out like petunia petals, and Virginia's had a scalloped edge that cupped in like a half-closed water lily. I held mine up to the light and it sparkled like yellow sapphire. "Qooh," I exclaimed, sucking in my breath. "Oooh," was all I could say, for how could anything have the gleam of pure gold and yet be so crystal clear? They were of cut glass, radiat- 823 November 1967 ing jets of reflected light like jewels. I was transported with joy. "Pretty, pretty, pretty," I whispered and danced around the room, holding the bowl high above my head. ''Mama will love, love, love our Christmas gift." Then I tripped on the rug and the bowl flew out of my hands. Virginia groaned, and I shut my eyes tight, waiting for the crash, but there was none. Then I looked. The bow] had landed on my pillow. "Ellie, how could you!" Virginia scolded. "'Even if there were one hundred more bowls like that, we couldn't buy another one, for we don't have the money." Weakly I sat down. We had planned and saved all summer to buy these for Mama. She had two little tables across the room from each other. There had to be two bowls. One wouldn't do. "T'm_ sorry,' I said, then laughed, "no, I'm glad, because everything is all right." Virginia gave me a look that silenced me. [ tucked my gift back in the box and she put hers beside it. "We'll put them away while they're still whole,' she said, climbing onto a chair. She slid the box onto the top shelf in our closet. She was content to leave the package hidden until Christmas, but I had to take a look every day. Whenever I was sure of not being intruded upon, I'd climb after the box and then stand dazzled at what was inside. One day I thought I heard someone coming. [| jumped, tipping the chair over and smashing the box against the foot of the bed. One of the bowls had spilled out and 824 lay glittering in a dozen broken pieces on the rug. My heart fell kerplunk, like a rock, to the pit of my stomach. I felt horrible. Through shimmering tears, I gathered the broken bits into an empty shoe box, vainly wishing that by some magic quirk the pieces would go back together again. The family was unusually gay at supper that night, especially Virginia. She bubbled. She had been like that ever since we bought the presents for Mama. Putting her lips to my ear she whispered, ""'We have a secret, haven't we!" My eyes smarted and. I ducked my head. Daddy looked up. "What! Cornmeal muffins, and you're not eating?" My chin quivered and I knew I'd better get out of there. "Excuse me. I forgot to wash my hands," I said, sliding back my chair. Locking myself in the bathroom, I buried my face in a towel and howled. Mama knocked on the door and I had to let her in. She took one look at me, then drew me into her arms. "Why Ellie honey, what's the matter?" "T don't feel so well," I sobbed. "Lots at school have sore throats." She got a little flat stick from the medicine cabinet. "Open your mouth," she said, turning me to the light. She flattened my tongue under the stick and I gagged. "Your throat isn't red at all," she observed, "but Ill swab it just for good luck." And she did. I spit and spit. "Where else do you feel bad?" she asked. "All over," I said truthfully. She gave me an aspirin and put me to bed. The next morning I assured her I was better and raced off to� school. After school I hurried to the Arrowhead department store, though I didn't know why. I couldn't have bought so much as a penny pencil. Hopefully, I seganionenne his looked in the crystal and china department. There was a flower bowl, not nearly so nice as the one I had broken, and a dollar cheaper, but it would be better than nothing. It was a_ pale orange. I felt desperate, for Christmas was only one week away. Thoughtfully I walked home, kicking little rocks ahead of me. At Sister Simpson's gate I hesitated. Maybe I could earn money running errands for her, I thought, so I knocked on her door. "Come in, Ellie. How nice to see you," she greeted. "T came to help you," I said. "Do you have errands to run?" "Bless you. I was just wishing for a little chick to run this book over to Grandma Bates for me." I raced with the book and got back in time to help her burn trash in her incinerator, then I The Golden Bowl knew I must hurry home. She gave me three fat raisin-filled cookies and a big hug. "Ellie, you're a darling for helping me," she said. I simply couldn't tell her I needed to earn money. I would have to think of something else. The next day I stopped at Turners. Mary Lou has three babies, and I thought she might need help. "Ellie, you're an absolute blessing," she said. "If you'll play with the youngsters while I hang out clothes it will be a great help." So I kept the twins from dragging the baby out of the bassinet until she came in, then she gave me three cookies and asked me to come again. I could see that all I'd ever earn for Christmas would be cookies. I was worried about Virginia, too. She might discover anytime what had happened. I wanted to tell her the whole miserable truth, but didn't have the courage. When I got home, Virginia pulled me excitedly into our room. "Look, Ellie, what Aunt Janet gave us!'' She held up a shiny sheet of green foil paper and a white ribbon bow, with peppermint stripes of green. Her eyes danced. "We can wrap the package now." Again my heart dropped like a rock to the pit of my stomach. Just then mama called, "Virginia, there ls someone to see you." Whew! Saved for a few minutes anyway. Slipping into my coat I ran to Sister Simpson's house, knocking loudly on her door. Opening it, she exclaimed, "'"My land child, you're winded," and drew me inside. 825 November 1967 'Sister Simpson, I need help quick," I panted. She sat me down and I tried to talk but my voice choked. All I could do was sit dumbly with tears running down my face. But she was patient and finally I poured out my woeful tale. "Golden glass is it!" she said thoughtfully, staring off into space. Then she took hold of my shoulders. "Ellie, is it really goldcolored glass?" I nodded and she hugged me. "Do you suppose you could stay for supper tonight?" She had a mysterious air that made my hopes zoom. "Oh, yes," I said. So she telephoned, and mama said it would be all right. ""While I set the table, Ellie, you run home and get the broken bowl." We lived only a few houses from her. When I burst into our room, there sat Virginia, weeping and holding pieces of the broken bowl in her hands. I felt awful. "Oh, Ellie, Ellie, how could you!" she sobbed. "IT wanted to tell you, but I couldn't." My eyes started to blur so I rubbed them on my coat sleeve. Taking the pieces from her I put them in the box. "Don't feel bad. I can fix it." "You can never, never fix it. It is broken in too many pieces." She burst into a fresh torrent of weeping. "Oh, yes I can. Sister Simpson is going to help me." I hurried out with the box before she could say more. Eating with Sister Simpson was an event. Her brocaded lunch cloth was snowy white. She put on a bowl of fresh holly and got out her green drinking glasses, es- 826 pecially for me. From her tiny toaster oven she served hot rolls with a fluffy cheese omelet and jelly. After the last dish was dried and put away, she opened the shoe box and picked up a piece of glass. "Just what we need. Ellie, we can make something special for your mother from this glass, but you will have to come every day until Christmas. Can you do that?" "You mean we can't fix the bowl?" I asked in disappointment. "No, dear, but we can fix something your mother will love." She went into another room and brought out a cloth-covered tray. "Lift the cloth, Ellie."' l was unprepared for what met my eyes. "Oooh!" I exclaimed. If, in the glass flower bowl I saw yellow sapphires, I now saw all of the other precious gems�diamonds, emeralds, blue sapphires, and rubies. "This is a gift 'm making for my daughter, but I need one more color to finish it."' "You need gold-colored glass?" "Yes. Mary Lou and I have been making our gifts together, and we were stalled for a particular color of glass. We've looked in every junk shop and dump and were about to give up. Ellie, if I help you with your gift, will you trade us a piece of your flower bowl? We have lots of colors to give you in return." I sat right down and laughed. Who ever heard of anyone, especially grownups, swapping chunks of broken dishes! "Sister Simpson, if I can make a gift like yours, I'll be as happy as a mouse in a wheat bin," I said. Then she laughed. "You can, Ellie, I promise. I'll teach you." I was so excited that I skipped' all the way home. Virginia was a problem, for she � asked too many questions. Finally I said, "Everything will be all right. Just you wait and see." My helping Mrs. Simpson was all right with mama, but Virginia never stopped prying me with questions. "Ellie, you are not really fixing that bowl together, are you?" she asked one night. "No," I confessed as I tumbled into bed. "Will what you're doing look nice on the other table?" "Of course," I snapped, then stopped dead still. It wouldn't go on a table at all! I hadn't thought of that. I pretended to sleep, but I was worried. Virginia would be disappointed. Oh, well, I finally thought, Mama will probably put a bowl of apples on the other table anyway, and I dozed off. The day before Christmas the tree was trimmed and the house smelled of evergreens and spices. Mama stood surveying the living room. Her brows were drawn in deep study. Finally she pointed. "That table," she said "'has got to go. Having two alike in this room is ridiculous." "T've a perfect place for it in Jimmy's room," Daddy said, and hustled it away before she changed her mind. Virginia looked like she was having a heart attack and I wanted to shout hallelujah! Daddy came back. "Now, my dear�I suppose you want something else moved into that vacant spot." With a twinkle, Mama said, The Golden Bowl "No, my dear, I like it the way it is." Dusk was gathering and colored lights began blinking from the houses down the street. "Put your coat on, Ellie, and take this package to Sister Simpson,' Mama said. Now was the time for me to spirit my own package home. The first pale stars were appearing overhead. A little breeze rustled the crisp brown leaves that still clung to the apple tree by the gate. From the loud speakers at the market place came the strains of "Little Town of Bethlehem." The air was soft and warm. Daddy had said we would have a warm Christmas. Sister Simpson was expecting me. I put the package from Mama under her tree and she handed me my treasure, beautifully wrapped. Breathlessly I held it, then I looked up at her. All at once she looked like a Christmas angel to me. I set my package down and threw my arms around her. She bent and kissed me. I wanted to tell her how much I loved her, but didn't know how. I only said, "You will have a good Christmas, won't you," and her laughter was merry as a silver bell. "That I will, Ellie. My children are coming home tonight." Now I was really happy, for she wouldn't be alone. I thanked her and skipped home. When I opened the door, the family had already gathered around the fireplace. There wasn't a chance to sneak my gift behind the tree, so I gaily called, ''Ho, ho, ho. Here comes Santa Claus. Everybody shut your eyes." And everyone did, except Virginia. I'm sure she peeked when I hid my 827 November 1967 package behind the tree. Christmas morning, Mama opened Virginia's package first. The flower bowl looked more exquisite than I had remembered it, and for a moment a feeling of sadness came over me, remembering the one I had broken. In one glance, Virginia and I looked where the other table and bowl were meant to be. In their place sat Daddy, lounging in the new easy chair Santa had brought him. Mama kissed Virginia and said, "This is beautiful," then picked up my package. Fingering the tag she read, "Merry Christmas to Mama from Ellie." Then she opened it. 'Oooh, Ellie, how did you do it?" Her eyes were like stars. "Sister Simpson helped me," I said. She got up and put the sparkling flower bowl on the table and leaned the picture I had given her, against the wall behind it. The picture repeated the color of the flower bowl, in long graceful sprays of goldenrod, made of cracked glass, accentuated by daisies and _ babies'-breath in apricot and blue glass. The leaves were a mossy green. "How did you ever find glass for the goldenrods that so perfectly matched Virginia's flower bowl?" Mama asked. I was momentarily chagrined and then my bursting pride took over. "It was a happy accident," I said. La HERITAGE Lois M. Anderson Alone | walked in the somber dusk, Resigned to my burden of grief; Feeling akin to the winter trees And the end of a life, too brief. Stark were their branches against the gray sky, Stripped by the north wind's sweep; No awakening forces arose to transcend Their heritage of sleep. Then a shaft of sunlight pierced the clouds Like a curtain parted at night, Tinting the bare boughs above my head With a luminous, golden light; And | suddenly visioned each cycle of life Impelled in a seasonal swing; When each in its autumn succumbed to the cold� It awaited another spring! Now, beneath the snow, each golden leaf Must moulder into dust� But, oh, | will remember the glory and the green These cold limbs hold in trust! ~ 828 Woman's Sphere Ramona W.

Most precious worldly treasures were presented to the Christ Child by those who were also rich in wisdom, and who journeyed to Bethlehem. They came worshiping but did not know that the gift requested of them in the future by the Christ would not be worldly treasures but a broken heart and a contrite spirit.

Aldous As the birthday season of the Christ Child approaches, there seems to be a spirit of good will which laves the atmosphere of the Christmas world. The very air seems to breathe the promise of the angels 'and on earth peace, good will toward men,"' in spite of wars and troublous times. This is felt by all who open their minds and hearts to the significance of Christmas. A mother wishes to be able to give to her children those material gifts which they desire, but far beyond that she wishes for them the gifts of the spirit which will enrich their lives eternally. In the month before Christmas, before the rush begins, a mother may sit down with pencil and paper, if desired, and list gifts she would bestow as she: evaluates where she stands in their giving. They will not be gifts for which the children clamor, in all probability, in fact, they will not realize their need for these gifts, but from the knowledge of each child which a mother possesses, she will select varying priceless gifts to bestow upon them. To one she may need to show more patient conduct, to another a sterner attitude for accomplishing work, to a third more understanding and tolerance, to a fourth more attention to childish confidences. The list may be long and it will require close attention as the year passes to meet the differing needs in each child's development. The greatest creativity is needed by a mother in thus analyzing and motivating herself. These are gifts which a mother bestows on her children through her own self-discipline. Another outpouring of gifts which she gives them is the tender training to enable them to improve themselves, to overcome their weaknesses�to see that Mary treats her sister Jane better, that Jim realizes the importance of telling the truth, that Helen keeps her room clean. A mother in relating her Christmas memories of childhood in the long ago reminisced: As | watch the tiny sparks [of an old Franklin stove] fly upward, | realize my childish love and eager desire for gifts have vanished with the sparks. But there remains with me the memory of the walks when | grudgingly took my basket and trudged through the deep snow to those humble cottages where lived those forgotten souls who were the last links in their family circles. | hear again their "God bless you, my dear, for the happiness you have brought to us this day." 1 feel to say, ''God bless those who implanted in my heart this true spirit of Christmas." So one who is a child today, may, in his mature years, likewise evaluate the gifts of grace bestowed on him by his mother in implanting in him the true spirit of Christmas, and find as a result he has completed his own journey to Bethlehem and can present his gift to the Savior of a broken heart and a contrite spirit. �WM. C. S. 831 There's More to Christmas @ Sarah surveyed the stack of gaily wrapped Christmas gifts lying on the davenport beside her. Why, she thought, do we mortals go to so much expense when it puts such a strain on the budget? Wouldn't it be better to exchange simple gifts, and then dwell more on the true meaning of Christmas? She sighed. The family wouldn't agree with her � probably, not even the adults, let alone the children. She was simply exhausted from the days and days spent in shopping for just the right gift for Aunt Sue, and her sister Jane, who had everything already. Her two children Davey and Debbie gave her particular instructions as to the type of gift she should buy them, without regard to cost. She could go on and on. 832 Helen H. Trutton Then there had been the task of housecleaning, the polishing of the tarnished silver, and the baking of goodies for the feast tomorrow. Dale's sister, Camille, had thought it best for Sarah to have the family gathering at her place this year, even though it wasn't Sarah's turn. She wasn't sure they were right. After Dale's death last June, she had soon learned that she could be lonely in a crowded room, or on a busy street. But one thing they were right about, she had been kept busy the past few weeks. Sarah stood up. They still had to go to the mountains to get a Christmas tree. When Dale was living, going to the beautiful forest of whispering pines was fun, especially for the children. The two of them would run through the white sparkling snow, squealing with joy at the beauty about them, picking first a lush green tree, only to find that just beyond was an even more magnificient one. Finally, she or Dale would settle on a tree, or the quest would go on without end. Sarah dreaded the trip today, but she must not disappoint the children �the outing had become traditional with them. The kitchen door swung open, and Davey stood grinning at her. "Say, Mom," he said. '"'Shouldn't we be on our way to the mountains? We have to be at Aunt Camille's place at seven for the Christmas party, and opening presents and stuff." "The tree should be all up and decorated," she said. "I've simply been too busy. Maybe since we're so late in going to the mountains." Davey interrupted her. "Oh, Mom, let's go and get our tree like always. Can't we?'' She sat back down on the davenport. "We may not be able to manage alone�without your father." He came over to her side, and draped his arm around her shoulders. "'I'm twelve, Mom. I can cut down a tree real easy. See my muscles," he said, exposing his arm. "Of course you can," she smiled back at him. "All right, but bundle up, and tell your sister to get ready." "Thanks," he called at the hall entrance. "Be back in a minute." She moved from the davenport to the closet, and took her heaviest coat from the rack. It would be cold in the hills. The first snows had already come to the high peaks. In fact, from the window she could see the entire mountains were blanketed in white, breathtaking beauty. "Is something wrong, Mother?" Debbie suddenly appeared beside her. "No, dear,' she answered. "I was just admiring the winter wonderland." "Just think, we'll be up there in about an hour," Debbie said, looking up at the mountains. "We'll find the most beautiful Christmas tree in the whole forest." "With my help,' Davey said, walking into the room. 'Cutting down a tree is a man's job." "Supposing we all count on helping," Sarah cut in. "'Here, let me check you both." She moved back as Davey and Debbie stood ready for inspection as they had done in years past. "I've got my red boots on, heavy pants, and my warm mackinaw jacket," Davey recited rapidly, "and my stocking cap. How's that, Mom?" "You pass." 'And look at me," Debbie said. Sarah slipped her arms around the two of them. "I think we are prepared for the North Pole," she laughed. ''Shall we go?" There was no traffic on the road. Either everyone had already made the trek to the woods in search of just the right tree, or they had purchased one at the many spots in town where they were being offered for sale. As they came near to the foothills, the murky sky began to spit snowflakes spasmodically. She had nothing to worry about, the cabin where they always stopped 833 November 1967 was located on a good road. She would insist that they stay near the cabin�there were plenty of choice trees close by. Davey finally broke into her thoughts. "See that big tree up on the hill,' he pointed off across country. "That's the one I'm going to chop down." "May we, Mother?" asked. "No, it's too large for our house, and this year, we'll find one near the cabin where we park every year." "Aw, Mom." Davey pulled a face. '"Mom's right," Debbie agreed. '"'We haven't much time if we get to Aunt Camille's on time." "Yeah, I know," he said. '""We can't be late, no matter what. I can hardly wait to open my presents.". "Is that more important than hunting for the very right tree?" Debbie asked. "Sure," he answered. "Look," Sarah said, motioning to an old farmhouse not far from the road. "Someone still lives there. See the smoke spiraling up from the chimney. Your father used to say we would stop by sometime�it seems so_ lonely there." "But not today,' Davey added quickly. ""We'd be late." ''And maybe the people aren't even friendly,' Debbie said. 'We should sometime, when we aren't in such a hurry." Sarah said. She couldn't help envying the family, or whoever lived in the old unpainted house, their exquisite surroundings. Red and golden bushes, painted by Jack Frost, were nodding gently as fresh-fallDebbie 834 en snowdrops bowed them toward the earth all along the road, and billows and billows of snowbanks stretched off into the distance. It was a beautiful sight! Some few miles farther, and the cabin came into sight. She had barely stopped the car before Davey and Debbie were out of the vehicle, axe in hand, laughing and talking, and running around like two wild Indians. "Oh, Mother," Debbie exclaimed. "It's hard to choose the best one. They're all so perfect." "Girls," Davey chided. "They don't know a good tree when they see one." Sarah watched them stop to examine each tree, then hurry on to the next one, shouting in excited tones, words she could not quite make out because the wind hid their voices. "Remember, don't get out of sight of the cabin," she yelled. Debbie waved back. ''We won't, Mother." She looked about her. She loved the solitude of the hills. Somehow the hustle and bustle of her busy life, and the exhaustion she had felt earlier in the day slid into oblivion; she felt close to God. "Mom," Davey's strong voice reached her. ''We found a real beauty." "Oh, Mom," Debbie's voice echoed his. "It's just perfect." When she reached them, Davey yanked off his mackinaw and held it out to her to hold. "Take the coat, Mom, I'll have this cut in a jiffy," he said. With the Christmas tree soon cut, she helped the youngsters load and tie it in the back of the vehicle. Then the three of them piled into the front seat of the car, and she turned on the ignition key and stepped on the starter. Noth-, Ing Nappened, so Sarah tried again. "We're out of gas," Davey groaned. "No," she answered. "We had a full tank when we left home." "What then?" Debbie asked. "Tt's the battery�it's dead I'm afraid." "Wow, Mom!" Davey leaned across his sister. "What are we going to do? We can't be late at Aunt Camille's." "Fix it," Debbie said confidently. "Silly," Davey answered her. "You don't just fix a battery� way up here in the mountains."' "What do you do with them?" "You get them recharged, or a new one. What will we do, Mom?" "I know," Debbie said. "We can spend Christmas Eve right here in the old cabin." She started to open the door of the car. "It would be fun." "And miss Aunt party? I should say not. Sarah shuddered. "Well, we can't stay in the cabin. It hasn't been used for years."' "Davey's right, we have to get to Aunt Camille's, [i wouldn't be Christmas without getting lots of presents." "Children," Sarah said slowly, "you know that old house back down the road?" "It's too far," Debbie grumbled. "Are you sure it's the battery, Mom?" Davey asked. "Yes, come on; we might as well start walking."' Sarah glanced up often at the jagged white-capped peaks towerCamille's 39 beautiful, mighty�and frightening. Supposing a blizzard struck suddenly, storms did come quickly in the mountains she knew. "How much farther?" Debbie whined. "My legs ache." "Hurry," Davey told her. "They won't wait for us at Auntie's," "T know," Sarah tried to sound enthusiastic. "We can talk about the many things we are grateful for this Christmas season. There's more to Christmas than Just presents." "Sure, Mom," Davey grumbled. "When you were little, you read every week to your blind aunt for her Christmas present, because you didn't have any money to buy her anything. But what have we? Supposing a bear comes out of the woods! What then?" 835 November 1967 "We'd miss Aunt Camille's Christmas Eve party forever. Oh, Mom�how much farther is it?" Debbie wailed. "Aunt Mabel really enjoyed that gift," Sarah said firmly. ""We have so much�our comfortable home waiting for us. We have each other, and friends and relatives we love." Neither Davey nor Debbie answered as the three of them walked in single file as much as possible in the car tracks made earlier, with only the sound of crunching snow under their feet, and the cold whistling of the north wind in the pine trees. Dusk was creeping over the forest now; shadows appeared unexpectedly in their path. Several times Sarah had to hold her cold hands against her mouth to keep from screaming. Bears had been seen in the mountains � maybe they weren't all in hibernation. Her legs were tired, and she was cold. "Are you all right?" she called frequently to Davey and Debbie. They barely spoke now�survival was utmost in their thoughts, she knew. And then she heard Debbie cry excitedly, '"There's the old house, Mom." "Hurrah!" Davey's cheer echoed in the cold stillness. ""Now we can have them drive us to town and Aunt Camille's." A plain-looking woman answered the knock. At first she looked startled at seeing them standing on her porch. "You are almost frozen," she finally said, opening the door wide for them to enter. "Please come in." Sarah explained their predica- 836 ment as briefly as possible, then asked, "'Do you have a telephone that I might call my brother-inlaw about our car?' The woman shook her head. "The lines are all down," she said. "But�but you can borrow our car if you will take my husband to the hospital. He's very ill." Sarah looked at the woman a moment. ''Why�yes," she said. "But don't you want to go with him? I could stay here if you'll take my two with you and leave them with their aunt." "IT never learned to drive a car," she answered, "and I couldn't ask so much, but please, please, take my husband to the hospital." Sarah looked at the woman's children. "Could we take them with us?" "Our little girl has a severe cold; I wouldn't dare expose her to the weather. My husband would never consent. But won't you?" "Of course we'll take your husband," Sarah said kindly. The woman's face softened. "Thank you, thank you," she said over and over again. "I'll get him ready."' And she hurriedly left the room. Sarah felt deep empathy for this woman whom she had never met before. If only there were a way that she could go with her husband to the hospital. They needed each other at a time like this. She thought about the day Dale became ill and was rushed to the hospital � if she couldn't have gone with him, been with him every possible moment? But what could she do? The woman couldn't drive a car, and she couldn't leave her children, so there was really nothing she could do. Nothing at all! A short time later the woman returned to the room with her husband leaning heavily on her." He stopped and smiled faintly at them. He was not wearing a coat. "Thank you,' he said, "for your kindness. Take the car. Perhaps tomorrow I will be better." ""No, no, you must go," his wife insisted. "'Please."' "But, dear,' he said slowly, then stopped as if to regain his strength. "I can't leave." At that moment, Davey moved unexpectedly to the man's side and said. "Please, both of you go. I'll stay here." "So will I,'' Debbie added. "I'm thirteen and we'll take good care of them. Mom, tell them we can do it." For one brief instant, the woman's face brightened, then faded. "T couldn't ruin your Christmas. But thank you." Sarah gasped. She hadn't even thought of that possibility. Even now she couldn't believe Davey and Debbie meant what they had just said. Miss the evening at Aunt Camille's? They wouldn't! Davey apparently saw the disbelief showing on Sarah's face, for he came quickly to her side and smiled self-consciously up at her. "Well, sure, Mom," he said seriously. "There's more to Christmas than presents." She couldn't speak, not right off, her heart was too full. She squeezed his hand tightly in hers as she fought desperately to hold back tears. Then, finally, she turned back to the woman, speaking in a barely audible voice. "I could drive you both to the hospital, and return here in a short time."' The woman looked at her hopefully. "If you could just return until my sister can get here. ['ll call her from town," she said. "She could be here in three hours." The man nodded. "Thank you for your kindness.' Then to his wife he said, '"'Get my coat, dear." Sarah smiled proudly at Davey and Debbie as she put her arms around them. 'Thank you, children,"' she whispered. "T'll hurry back."

Joyfully I hopped behind the old yellow road grader as it slowly nudged soft, deep drifts. Great flakes had frosted our little Canadian town in marshmallow icing that glittered now in the sunlight like a tinseled fairyland. Just about as radiant as the wonderful tree at school today, I thought. Christmas trees were very dear to prairie people. Mama always said trees were hard to come by when you lived so far from the mountains. But never had I feasted my eyes on such a holiday sight. If only we had a tree like the one at school, but we 838 Louise Harmon would be lucky to get even a little one this year Daddy had said, and it seemed he was taking his time about getting it. I would have to remind Mama again when I got home. Home and now Christmas at last... I flew over the last drifts and through our door into a kitchen warmly fragrant with gingerbread cookies. "Oh, Mama," I shouted, ''you should have seen that tree today! It touched the ceiling and there were hundreds of candles lighted and the teacher gave me some crayons at the party." "And you're cold and wet," said Mama, "go change quickly and give me a hand with the cookies." "'Are these to hang on our tree, Mama? Did Daddy get it today?" Mama silently steered me into the bedroom. Later, as we finished the little fat cookie men, I reminded her again of our tree. "Well, sister, would you really mind this year if Daddy couldn't get one? Couldn't we have just as nice a time without one?" Not a tree! Why even the Coney's had theirs. Arguing did no good, so I decided to ask Daddy about it. When he came in that night he smiled and reassured me, saying, "We've never let you kiddies down yet, have we?' That was true, and enough to satisfy me, so I was content to wait. And besides, tonight we were putting up the homemade fireplace Daddy had built for our stockings. Such a thrill it was to see it resplendent in its firebrick paper and sparks almost ready to fly from its red tissue paper firebox. The time passed quickly, with all the cleaning to do, paper chains to hang, and decorations to make. Then Christmas Eve shadows began to gather us into the excitement of a hallowed night. Anxiously, our young eyes pried at the door until Daddy finally came home from work. But his big arms were empty not even a pine branch! Tears stung my eyes and disappointment overwhelmed me. It just couldn't be! Mama's playing "Jingle Bells'' brought all my little brothers trooping into the living room for Home Evening. Slowly, I folA Miracle at Christmas lowed and longingly I looked at the empty corner. How could Daddy let us down? Didn't he know how much it mattered? Somehow the evening passed, the long brown stockings were hung, prayers softly said, and Mama tucked us into bed. Strains of "Silent Night" floated from the piano and flickering shadows from the red tapers lulled us. I sadly comforted myself thinking about Jesus and how he never had a tree. "Sleep in heavenly peace," sang Mama, and I did. Excited shouts from my little brothers suddenly awakened me. As I flew out of bed onto the cold, slick linoleum, I could hear them crying, "Oh, Weezie, come here quick! Look at our tree! We have a Christmas tree, and it's right on our table." I stood speechless with wonder and delight. There, indeed, stood a lovely tree, and presents were heaped under fragrant branches. Our Father had not let us down! Such joy and excitement as we gazed and marveled at the miracle. Little did we realize then that this miracle at Christmas was our father's own creation, fashioned with hands of love late on that Christmas Eve. One of the teachers, upon hearing of our indigent circumstances, had kindly offered him the branches trimmed from that tall tree at school. After drilling holes in a small pole, he had carefully fitted and nailed each branch into place, and a tree was born. That tree, when viewed through the eyes of love and faith, became the most beautiful, unforgettable tree in all this world to four small children on a prairie many years ago. 839 NASER LES TS TESTES TESTI SSIES REFRESHMENTS FOR THE HOLIDAY SEASON Zola McGhie Hot Cider 2 quarts cider 2 tsp.

A beginning seamstress can even make it herself and feel the satisfaction of accomplishment, for this sewing project is simple, yet looks professional. You begin with a purchased ''poor-boy'' top�the kind many girls are wearing these days. They come in many pretty colors and launder very well. They make a good beginning for a new dress. Choose a plain color and then buy a piece of fabric in a print or plaid to match or contrast with the shirt. The amount of fabric to buy will vary according to the type of skirt you want to make. If you want to have pleats all around, you will need two yards of material. A straight skirt will require less. If the shirt fits snugly, you will need a long zipper, if it is loose and slips over the head, you will not have to use a zipper. This dress will be long-waisted, because the shirt fits down over the hips. To make: If you are going to use a zipper, it should be as long as the shirt is from the top of the neck to about an inch from the bottom hem. Cut the shirt down the back, straight at the center. Now make a 5% inch seam, using the longest machine stitch. Baste the closed zipper along the seam, centering the zipper. Now machine stitch along the baste stitches, and remove the seam (figure 2). Lf your skirt is going to be pleated, make sure the pleats are all even, by pinning them all in place before stitching to the skirt. Use a ruler to get them all the same depth (figure 1). Stitch the skirt to the shirt and hem. Now press the pleats. If the skirt is straight, just sew a length of material all around the shirt, leaving only a back seam. Have about a two-inch hem. If you would like a fashion note, place loops for a belt at each side, and one in the center back. 842 (figure 1) | | | 1 | { MEASURE PLEATS WRONG SIDE (figure 2) NOVEMBER _ Alda L.

Now is the time to watch foxtail wave a last farewell, and glory in its golden, triumphant beauty. This is the last goodbye to summer. The lonely hiatus. One day soon we will waken to a morning sparkling with white diamonds. We will light the fires of winter and the long-waiting candles of another Christmas. And we will turn once again to the warmth and welcome glow of our winter hearthside.... 843 November 1967 BLEAK AUTUMN Christie Lund Coles The tules are broken along the river, The milkweed pods are barren of seed; The water is a meandering sliver Through a border of rock and tumbleweed; The golden hills have faded to umber, The scene, in the distance, is stark, austere; Each bird seems wrapped in a songless slumber; There is a chilling silence far and near. The clouds are a host of black masts driven By relentless winds toward the somber night; Then, all of a sudden, the sky is riven And all the scars of earth are healed and white; Wonder replaces bleakness and sorrow, Crystalline beauty awaits us tomorrow. Grandmother Said Evelyn Fjeldsted Growing old is living with the calm assurance and anticipation of things yet to come. It is knowing that the hardships and sorrows of yesterday are in the past. It is the time of the after-years, when the sunlight never seemed so gently warm, the moon becomes a light from heaven, and a flower garden could be a white freesia blooming in the window. It is a time of wistful thinking, remembering all the sweet little incidents that were so wonderful and made life so worthwhile, and also wishing that some things could have been different, too. It is drifting in a realm of peace. The storms have largely come and gone, and life's drama is, for a little while, forgotten. It is a time of solid conviction that wrongs will be made right�sometime. It is finding a great love�a love that young people realize only by living through the years. Growing old should bring greater insight and understanding; a page has been turned and a new page is being learned. It is believing in God simply because he is there, and having faith in him is as natural as breathing, even though faith is sometimes a mystery to reason. It is a time when things that once seemed so important have almost lost their reality. It is the after-years that bring the inexpressible joy of work almost finished�a story that cannot be told. It is following a course toward a terminal where the homefolks are waiting with a glad welcome and where there will be a great reunion. 844 wi A MULTI-TALENTED WORKER Ida Noble, Denver Fifth Ward, Denver South Stake, Colorado, has done handiwork for many years.

Breeze Chapter 3 SYNOPSIS: Nancy Jackson, a dance instructor and mother of two children, is just opening a dance studio in her remodeled home, when her husband, Grant, tells her that he wants to accept a teaching assignment on the island of Saipan. Reluctantly, Nancy accepts her husband's decision and makes plans for the journey. An official letter arrives, changing the assignment to the island of Truk. � Riding in the Trust Territory's DC-4 through cotton-puff clouds reminded Nancy of riding on a horse. If you went up and down when it did, you had it made. And if you didn't? Well�it couldn't last forever. "Nan?" Grant leaned across the aisle and whispered to her. "You feel all right?" "Do I have to answer that?" "No. It's a little different from the jetliners, isn't it?" "T felt all right until I saw that little red fire engine swing out to follow us down the runway, at the airport in Guam." "Routine." "Grant?" "H'm?"' "Do you think it will be that hot in Truk? I mean, like Guam? When we first stepped off the plane, I couldn't even breathe. What will we do if it's that way in Truk?" 846 "I'm sure it won't be. Besides, any time you step from air conditioning into the heat, it sort of smothers you at first." Nancy stroked Amy's head and looked across the aisle to where Grant was holding Skipper. "We're lucky they have slept so well," she said. Grant nodded in agreement. Then a quizzical frown on his face led Nancy to look across the aisle at the seat back of him. He mouthed the words, trying not to let anyone hear what he said. Nancy giggled and held her hand up to the side of her mouth. "Live chickens," she whispered. "Routine." As the vintage engines roared above the painted blue of the Pacific, Nancy closed her eyes� sometimes dozing, sometimes thinking ahead. She wanted to feel that what they were doing was a step forward. But somehow she couldn't escape the feeling that they had just given up everything to go thirty years into the past. It wasn't riding on a well-worn plane with live chickens that made her feel this way. The idea had possessed her even when they Throw Down the Gauntlet had said goodbye to their family and friends at home. They had all been there�everyone who meant __so_much to her. She had wanted to smile and say goodbye with great confidence. But when the time came to walk through the concourse gate out onto the field, she hadn't been able to look back. She couldn't let them see her cry. She couldn't let them see how unsure she still was of the whole idea. Now a friendly Micronesian dressed in dark trousers and spotless white shirt stepped through the door at the front of the aisle. "Please to fasten your safety belts,' he said. "We landing soon." Soon it will all be over, Nancy thought. In another hour we'll stop existing in transit and start living again! And I will make the most of it. I will! Then, for the first time, as the plane banked sharply to the left, Nancy saw the distinct contrast of blue and green water. "Grant�how come the water is a different color?" "That's the lagoon." "Tt still looks like ocean to me. I always thought lagoons were sleepy little lakes." "Only in the movies. Look! Where the water does change color you can see the white surf banging against the reef table." "Grant! There's another one! On the landing strip!" "Another what?" "Toy fire engine. Don't they trust this thing at all?" Grant laughed. "Close your eyes, honey. You won't feel a thing." As the four of them stepped from the plane, a young '"State- 847 November 1967 side' woman in a pink cotton dress appeared from nowhere and threw a lei of white Plumiera around Nancy's neck. "Hello," she shouted. I'm Susan Leonard�Miss."' Then she lassoed Grant with red Hibiscus. "Boy, are we glad you're here! Almost thought I was going to get stuck with teaching botany myself!" Grant laughed and shook her hand. "Go through that little gate over there and show your shot cards and I'll be getting your luggage!" She disappeared into a quiet lagoon of strange, inquisitive faces. "Do I look as conspicuous as I feel?" Grant whispered to Nancy. "Why should you? You're only head and shoulders taller than anyone else around." Nancy grinned. "'And with that red necklace�well. " "Show the man your shot card." Susan rushed up again in a flurry. ''They're putting your bags in my car. Over this way!" She grabbed Amy and Skipper by the hands and they scrambled after her. Nancy and Grant followed their chauffeur obediently, and listened attentively to an endless trail of chatter that left the impression that Susan was starving for someone to talk to. "First time I ever went back to Guam after being here," she said, "it about scared me to death! All the cars, and people, I mean. I really prefer trees, myself. Now you take the flame trees�Poinciana. Most beautiful thing in all nature. See there? See the blossoms? Looks like the whole tree's on fire, doesn't it? Breathtaking!"' 848 It was but a brief ride before they emerged from their paved tunnel of greenery into a small clearing. "There she is!" claimed. ''Home!"' Nancy looked about her and hesitated, afraid to ask. "Yours �or ours?" "Yours! And believe me! It's the nicest quonset on the island!" Come on inside! I'll show you!" Nancy stepped cautiously from the car as she saw an old black bull eyeing her from behind a coconut palm. "Grant?" she said so Susan wouldn't hear. "I thought the houses were supposed to be concrete�and new?" "That was on Saipan," he said. '""Remember?" Amy and Skipper raced each other through the ankle-deep grass and into the corrugated steel dwelling which was to be their home. "Mama!" - Skipper "Come see! Bugs!" Nancy stepped through the door of the kitchen and followed her excited son. "Wookie!" "Ants! Grant, look! A whole parade! Ten feet long!" "Oh, you'll get used to them," Susan said, "and the cockroaches." Nancy was horrified. "'Big cockroaches?" "You'll find saddles for them under the sink in the kitchen." Grant enjoyed Susan's humor, but Nancy's expression remained serious. "Come in here," Susan continued. "I'll show you the hot closets. See? Some of them have hot rods. Some have light globes. Susan exyelled, 3) But they all do the same thing� keep the closets dry. Anything you don't want mildew on, just put it in there. The one in the kitchen is very good for keeping the salt and sugar dry and the crackers from getting soggy!" Amy and Skipper excitedly ran up and down the long hallway, exploring. "Sort of like living on a train," Nancy said, looking around, "all the little square windows. And the long narrow hall." "Which reminds me, the wind always blows from that direction."' Susan pointed. "So be sure to close the shutters whenever you leave home. Even though it doesn't look like rain, there may be a downpour any minute." Nancy seemed to panic at the thought of being closed up. "If you shut them it would be dark in here!" "So turn the light on�or get wet. Take your choice! And while I'm at it, I might add, that you'll know if there's ever a typhoon due. The wind comes from the opposite direction. But don't worry about it. We have ample warnings. Actually, if there's a storm, you can't be in a better place than a quonset. No flying glass. And the whole building is cabled to the ground. You're really perfectly safe." As the word safe fell from her lips, a piercing scream resonated up the hall. "Amy!" Nancy dropped her purse and ran toward the sound. "Amy! Where are you?" Skipper pointed to the bedroom closet. "'In there." "Grant! The doors are warped! They won't slide! I can't get her out!" Amy's screaming grew more and more intense as Grant struggled to get the doors open. Then, as they gave way, Nancy pushed past Grant and grabbed Amy off the closet floor. "Oh, baby. It's all right, Amy. Mommie's got you." Susan pointed to a_ scarlet streak across the calf of Amy's leg. '""She's burned it on the hot rod. Better put her in some cold water. I'll fix an ice pack, and then we can take her to the hospital." "Oh, it doesn't look that bad," Grant said. "Let me tell you. In this climate, if you only scratch the top off a mosquito bite, you get something on it. If you don't�you'll have a spot the size of a quarter in twenty-four hours. We grow the healthiest bacteria in the world!" As Nancy stepped from Susan's car onto the crushed coral parking lot of the little hospital, she grabbed at Grant's arm to steady herself. "High heels aren't very practical around here," Susan said. 849 November 1967 "And once you take those nylons off, I can quarantee you'll never put them on again until you get Stateside." "They do feel a bit woolly and drippy.'' Nancy laughed, as she tried to dry her stockings with a handkerchief. The air in the hospital waiting room hung heavy and antiseptic as one squeaky fan made a dedicated effort to move from side to side. For a moment, Nancy had the feeling that she was in the depot of a very small town, for the only available seats were row upon row of hard, wooden benches. Grant sat down with Amy on his lap and stretched her legs out over Nancy's knees. Across the aisle, an old Trukese woman grinned broadly at them, her teeth decayed from years of chewing betel nut. A small child at her side had legs covered with what must have been the scars of unattended mosquito bites. As Nancy continued looking at the child's riddled, brown legs and back again at Amy's, all of the day's events seemed to rush back and press tightly around her. As she labored to think clearly, the warm, moist air became more and more impossible to breathe, and her head fell backwards into darkness. As the blackness edged its way forward into gray, Nancy heard Grant's voice and felt him shaking her. "This is the doctor," Grant said, as her eyes focused on a second figure.; '"What's he doing here?" she mumbled. The small, dark figure stood at the side of the examining table where Nancy lay. 850 "You been sleep, Missus."' '"Where's Amy?" '"She's fine, Nancy,' Grant said. "Susan took her and Skip for a walk. Her leg feels all right." "Your husband tell me it long time you see your doctor." "Well, we got so busy there at the last minute with getting ready to come, and." "You have two baby, Missus??' "Yes," Nancy smiled. "I have two babies. Amy and Skipper." "No, Missus. You going have two baby. You go back to Guam. Wait. Navy doctors take good care of you in big American hospital." "You must be mistaken!" She sat upright and tried to get off the table, but Grant gently settled her back down. "No, Nancy," he said. "I was so frightened when you fainted, I told him about the baby. He heard two distinct heartbeats. He's sure it's twins." "But why does he say I have to go to Guam?" "He says they have only one incubator here, Nancy. If the babies are small, it just wouldn't be safe. You'll have to go while you can still travel." "But how can you just up and leave a job you haven't even started? School starts in three days." "T can't, honey. Ill have to find someone to look after Amy and Skipper. And you'll have to go alone, sometime before November�while you can still travel." "Alone!" The Trukese man in white patted Nancy's hand and smiled. "You go," he said. "American lady very brave."

Sister Vera P. Hart, former supervisor, French Mission Relief Society, reports: "This little branch in Ethiopia operates independently of the mission, but is an inspiration to us all. Relief Society in the Addis Ababa Branch was organized in 1964. The members are wives of university professors, and meet in one another's homes. They take turns giving lessons, and each is an inspiration to the others. "They have no problems with inactivity. In March they held a dinner to commemorate the birth of Relief Society, and recently the Singing Mothers presented two songs in sacrament meeting. Even with such a small group, the program was lovely and inspirational. "While they all look forward to their return to the States, they feel that the choice experiences the Church provided in Africa can never be duplicated." Leola C.

"Oh, no, I'm too old," the mother dramatizes in the skit which portrays the ideal home. Elna H. Palmer, President, Wilford Stake Relief Society, reports: "Our annual May festival was held in the morning and the evening. Luncheon was served to about. 550 sisters in the morning, with 375 youngsters being tended in the nursery. About 350 young people and their parents attended the evening program. ""A fashion show was presented by the mothers in the morning and in the evening by the MIA Laurels. The theme for the event was 'Make Your Home a Heaven on Earth.' Displays, hobbies, and demonstrations were most effective. Special demonstrations were: quilt making, table setting, chocolate dipping, gold leafing, afghans, whole wheat bread-making, decorations for all occasions, and old fashioned spinning on a spinning wheel. "Our program was an original skit, 'A Home for Heidi,' a musical which portrayed the story of Heidi being given a choice of which home she would like to live in here on earth before returning to her Heavenly Father. Music was furnished by the Singing Mothers and special groups."

The theme for the event was "Talent Fair,' and talent was plentiful in the original poetry, songs, writing, and displays presented. The most outstanding feature was the table decoration at the potluck dinner which followed the program. It consisted of flower arrangements made from vegetables and grapefruit peel. There were roses, narcissus, dogwood blossoms, and calla lilies, all made from grapefruit peel, white and yellow turnips, carrots, parsley, and honeydew melons. "Outstanding displays in all departments showed the work of many talented sisters. The use of a transportation committee which makes certain that each sister has a ride and someone to enjoy the day with, helped to make the social most. Outstanding."

Doxey (Reading Assignment: Doctrine and Covenants, Section 109) Northern Hemisphere: First Meeting, February 1968 Southern Hemisphere: July 1968 Objective: The Latter-day Saint woman analyzes the dedicatory prayer given by revelation to enlarge her understanding of proper entreaties to the INTRODUCTION As early as 1832, the Lord commanded his people to build a temple in Kirtland, Ohio. (D&C 88:119-120.) A committee was appointed to obtain funds for the construction of the temple. The Lord had told his people that a purpose of this building was that the disciples might go forth to prune the vineyard for the last time. (Ibid., 95:4) In the circular sent out by the committee, it was said that this house would be the place where the elders might call a solemn assembly, and treasure up words of wisdom that they might go to the gentiles for the last time. (DHC 1:349.) THE KIRTLAND TEMPLE On March 27, 1836, the day of the dedication of the Kirtland temple, the structure, consisting of two stories and an attic, was finished except for the second story. The first and second stories Lord to assist her in her own praying. Each had two pulpits, one at each end, consisting of four different compartments, one arising above and a little behind the next one, capable of seating three persons each. One set of the pulpits was for the Melchizedek Priesthood while the one at the other end of the room was for the Aaronic Priesthood. By means of curtains or veils hanging from the ceiling, each room could be divided into four compartments or classes. The doctrine of baptism for the dead had not been revealed at this time, consequently, there was no baptismal] font in the building. The building was, however, constructed to suit and accomodate the various quorums of the Priesthood and worship of the Church at that time. In the attic, five rooms were built for the holding of school and the use of different quorums of the Priesthood. DEDICATORY SERVICE The dedicatory service con- 859 The Kirtland (Ohio) Temple, dedicated March 27, 1836, consists of two stories and an attic. It still stands today, although it is not presently owned by the Church. In the first and second stories were two pulpits, one at each end, consisting of four compartments, one _. Arising above and a little behind the next, each seating three persons. Ee ee Reh ' sisted of praying, congregational singing, preaching, testimony bearing, and the dedication of the building by the reading of the prayer given by revelation. Following the prayer the congregation was led in the Hosanna Shout. An important part of the service was the approval of the General Authorities under the law of common consent. It was upon this occasion that the Prophet Joseph Smith asked the people to sustain the Twelve Apostles as Prophets, Seers, and Revelators. (DHC Il:410-428.) Many spiritual manifestations were observed during the day. SECTION 109 Section 109 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the dedicatory prayer for the Kirtland Temple, was received by revelation. (DHC II: 420.) Although this prayer was given for a special purpose, there are many elements in it which may assist members of the Church to understand the two following aspects of prayer: (1) prayer form; and (2) prayer content. It is understood that prayer should be appropriate to the occasion, and it should come from the heart. Particularly where members of the Church are called upon to offer public prayers in behalf of those assembled in meetings, there is suggested the need to use language which expresses the purpose of the prayer. In a study of this dedicatory prayer, one should not consider that all things for which a person should pray are mentioned, because of the special purpose of this prayer. One can learn, however, many important points about prayer which may be beneLesson Department ficial. This revelation is the model for the dedication of temples and other structures in the Church. PRAYER CONTENT Some members of the Church are concerned as to how they can keep their daily prayers from becoming formal and trite. If one prays for individual needs only, there is a reason for reviewing the many possibilities for which one might sincerely pray. Section 109 gives many of these points. Some of these elements are as follows: (1) purpose; (2) expression of gratitude; (3) remembrance of others; (4) protection and assistance; (5) forgiveness of sin; (6) the Church and the gospel. Class Discussion What is the proper prayer language? PURPOSE Frequently members of the Church who represent a group or congregation in giving the invocation, mention the purpose for which the meeting is being held. Sometimes reference is made to the faith and diligence of those present. In the dedicatory prayer one reads a review of the events in the building of the Kirtland Temple. The fulfillment of the commandment to build the temple is mentioned (D&C 109:1-4) and the tribulations experienced amid poverty, "that the Son of Man might have a place to manifest himself to his people' (Ibid., 109: 5). President Sidney Rigdon gave a two and one-half hour address during the service, the purpose of which was to compare the privations and hardships of the people in building the temple with that 861 November 1967 of the saints during the time of the Savior. (Life of Heber C. Kimball, p. 90.) The Prophet also prayed, as we do, for success in a calling, that the solemn assembly commanded to be held, might be acceptable. (Ibid., 109:6-13.) REMEMBER THE MISSIONARIES Those members of the Church who have had members of their families serve as missionaries, or who themselves have been on missions for the Church, or who may have been converted through the labors of missionaries, have a strong feeling for the success of those who labor in the mission field. All members of the Church who have a sincere desire for the growth of the Church are anxious to have the Lord's power with his servants. Many verses in the dedicatory prayer are devoted to this subject. The desire of the Prophet was that nothing which would thwart the progress of the Church would be successful. That those who lied or published slanderous material against the saints might be confounded, was a part of that petition. (Ibid., 109:24-33.) Before the saints had established Kirtland, Ohio, as a gathering place, the Lord promised that when his servants were endowed there would be a gathering to the bosom of the Church. (Lbid., 38:38.) This endowment would be such that they would be taught from on high to perform missionary work. (Ibid., 43:16.) With the temple built, the great missionary program would be inaugurated. Apparently the endowment referred to in reference to the Kirt- 862 land Temple was an outpouring of the Holy Ghost. The Prophet prayed for this blessing for those who would go forth to preach the gospel. (Ibid., 109:22-23, 35, 42.) Class Discussion How important is it that you pray for the missionaries in your daily prayers? REMEMBER THE SUFFERING SAINTS The Prophet prayed that the actions of wicked men against the saints would cease, and that their persecutors might repent of their wicked ways. (D&C 109:45-53.) The persecution suffered by the saints of the Missouri period consisted of both physical and mental persecution. Although the saints today do not receive persecution from arms or the loss of homes and a lack of the necessities of life, still, in some mission fields, there is possible loss of employment and some forms of ostracism. Latter-day Saints throughout the world may well pray for their fellow members that persecution may cease, but that if tribulations come, they may be able to withstand them. REMEMBER THE HEADS OF GOVERNMENTS Latter-day Saints are known as a peace-loving people. They wait for the day when there will be a permanent peace with the coming of the Savior. (Ibid., 101:26.) They have been commanded, also, to renounce war and to seek peace through the turning of the hearts of the children to the fathers and the hearts of the fathers to the children. ([bid., 98:16-17.) This admonition to preach the gospel that peace may be generated in the hearts of men, is consistent with the truth that surcease from war and calamity are not promised for this dispensation. (Jbid., 1:35; 97:22-23.) Latter-day Saints have the opportunity to pray for the day when the Savior will come that a new day will dawn upon the world. They also may pray for the rulers of nations, as did the Prophet Joseph Smith, that their hearts and the hearts of their subjects may be softened that they may accept the servants of the Lord who will preach to them the gospel of peace. (Ibid., 109:54-58.) REMEMBER THE LEADERS OF THE CHURCH We learned in last month's lesson that Latter-day Saints should sustain those who preside over them, by their prayers. (Ibid., 108:7.) In the following words, President George Albert Smith encouraged the saints to do this: 1 hope that we will be found in the lines of our duty, praying for and sustaining our present leaders, blessing them by our kindness and our love, and presenting them before our Heavenly Father in our daily prayers, asking him that he will give them the richness of his love and blessing (Conference Report October 1934, p. 53). Not only did the Prophet Joseph Smith pray that the Lord would remember him, but also his family and relatives, together with the other leaders of the Church. (D&C 109:68-71.) REMEMBER THE POOR AND AFFLICTED A purpose of earth life is that man may experience pain, sorrow, and tribulation. (Jbid., 122:7-8.) Through these experiences a sympathetic understanding is develLesson Department oped toward others who suffer. The dedicatory prayer included the petition to remember the various families of the Church with their sick and afflicted, and also the poor and the meek of the earth. ([bid., 109:72.) PROTECTION AND ASSISTANCE Life is precious. We cling to life when sickness or accident threatens the taking of life. The prophecies are abundant that refer to the judgments of the last days, and we see that these predictions are coming to pass. It is our desire that we and our loved ones can withstand these calamities. ([bid., 29:14-21; 43:22-26; 45:31-33.) ) In reference to these judgments, the Prophet indicated that the Lord's predictions would be fulfilled and that we should recognize that the Lord's will would be done. Recognizing that these conditions will prevail on the earth, he prayed that the saints might be delivered from that wickedness. (I bid., 109: 43-46.) FORGIVENESS OF SINS Forgiveness of sins comes through the atonement of Jesus Christ. Latter-day Saints should express to their Heavenly Father appreciation for the gift of repentance through Jesus Christ. (Ibid., 109:34.) THE CHURCH AND THE GOSPEL In the gospel plan there are many events predicted for the dispensation in which we live. Those mentioned in the dedicatory prayer are events for which Latter-day Saints might well pray for their speedy fulfillment. The Prophet 863 November 1967 prayed on behalf of the membership of the Church that the Lord would have mercy upon the various segments of scattered Israel. He called attention to the need for the Jews to return to their ancient homeland. (/bid., 109:61- 64.) The Lamanites about whom The Book of Mormon reveals a great destiny, are mentioned as subjects of salvation to be converted to the fulness of the gospel. ([bid., 109:65-66.) Finally, the Prophet prayed that the rest of scattered Israel might be gathered into the Church from the nations of the earth. (I bid., 109:67.) THY WILL BE DONE Man's understanding is limited. He is unable to see beyond his own vista except through the eye of prophecy. God's sight is an eternal one�from the beginning to the end. He knows all things, and he is all-powerful. Latter-day Saints have the privilege of learning the will of the Father and of understanding by the light of revelation, insofar as revelation allows. There are times in men's lives when they must accept through faith the unrevealed, and say, as the Prophet Joseph Smith prayed in this dedicatory prayer: "Thy will be done, O Lord, and not ours" (D&C 109:44). Class Discussion Why do you believe that one should pray, "'not as I will, but as thou wilt'? (Matt. 26:39) IMPLEMENTATION Latter-day Saints have been counseled from the beginning to 864 express their faith through individual prayer, through family - prayer, and, when asked, before the congregations of the saints. They have come 'to realize that without prayer they cannot receive: salvation. Children reared. In Latter-day Saint homes learn to pray. There are times when it seems that there is a need to express oneself beyond the usual requests for individual needs. The possibilities of expressing one's innermost feelings concerning the Church and the gospel are almost limitless. As one comes to understand the plan of salvation better, his desires for success of the kingdom are increased, and his appreciation for what the Lord has provided mankind through the gospel is greatly enlarged. The dedicatory prayer for the Kirtland Temple, given by revelation, is a source of inspiration for those who seek to enlarge their prayer possibilities. Out of this revelation, one may receive confirmation of matters about which he has prayed, and also learn of other opportunities which, apparently, the Lord would have us understand. Might it not be well seriously to consider further ex- -pressions of gratitude for the numerous privileges which are ours? One need not mention all possible prayer elements in a given prayer, but perhaps one or more new items may be spoken to be replaced by other thoughts in subsequent prayers, as the Spirit may direct. The Lord has said that he who obeys his ordinances and prays with a contrite spirit is accepted of him. (D&C 52:15.) VISITING TEACHER MESSAGE�Truths to Live By Message 5�Take Time to Show Love Alice Colton Smith Northern Hemisphere: First Meeting, February 1968 Southern Hemisphere: July 1968 Objective: We must organize our lives so as to have time to show Long ago on the robber-infested road to Jericho, two churchmen did not stop to help-a man in need, but a despised Samaritan had compassion on him (Luke 10:33) and cared for him. Did the priest and the Levite justify themselves by some need to hurry? Was their business so pressing or important that they had no time to help? Were they fearful of being involved? It takes time to love, and Jesus stressed that we are to take the time. When this parable was discussed recently with a busy mother, she put her head in her hands and moaned, "Where shall I find the time?" The good Samaritan could not stay with the wounded man until he was well. He helped him to an inn and paid for his care. So, sometimes, we can pool our resources and get help we cannot or do not know how to give. If we do this, do we help once and then forget, letting someone else carry all the load, or do we, like the Samaritan return to check and see that all is going well? The needs of the world are of an unending, overwhelming, magnitude. What can one do? Joseph Smith advised the Relief Society, "Let your labors be mostly conlove to others. Fined to those around you, in the circle of your own acquaintance" (DHC IV, p. 607). He knew that each of us has time to take good care of only a few. However, if everyone followed his advice, no man would be without help. The Good Samaritan thought through the problems and made the necessary arrangements. In our showing love, the same thoughtful planning is required. Do we set a time to determine what we will try to do? Then do we organize our time and do it? For example, everyone needs a sympathetic listener, one who loves and listens without being preoccupied or hurried. One mother, understanding this, sat at the table for a half hour after breakfast and dinner. Soon her family discovered that this was the time to talk to mother and receive her undivided attention. This mother did listen. To help us organize and have time to love we might try the following: (1) decide what is important; (2) sacrifice things of lesser value; (3) tackle one problem at a time; (4) be patient; (5) understand that it takes a long time to develop and train one's capacity to love; (6) expect mistakes and rebuffs as we learn to love; and, (7) give of oneself. November 1967 HOMEMAKING�Development Through Homemaking Education Discussion 5�The Living Room�Your Design for Living Celestia J. Taylor Northern Hemisphere: Second Meeting, February, 1968 Southern Hemisphere: July 1968 Objective: To awaken us to the possibilities of using what we INTRODUCTION Sir Winston Churchill once said that "we shape our houses and then they shape our lives." It is not possible for us to escape the fact that the homes we live in are a reflection of ourselves�of our desires, our values, and our personalities. "Oh,'' you say, "this isn't true; if J had more money, this isn't the way I'd live or the kind of house I'd live in, at all." Many people have excused their inadequacies and have justified their inability to create a satisfactory way of life, by this kind of reasoning. Money is seldom the answer, however, to the question as to the kind of life we build for ourselves within our homes. Rather, the real answer lies in our ability to make the most of what we have and to face the truth about our limitations. In most parts of the world, the poorest of us today have far more to work with than did our grandparents, and most of them managed to make of their homes places of beauty, enriched with the joy of contentment. At 866 have to the greatest advantage. The same time, the richest of us need to know that the extravagant expenditure of money does not guarantee good taste or lasting satisfaction in our possessions. How can we make our living rooms reflect the kind of life which each of us wants to live? PLAN FOR THE FAMILY The living room should be planned and arranged to best serve its function as the living center of the home for the people who are to use it. The furniture should be placed for the convenience of living, to serve family interests, and in "conversational groupings" for gracious living and entertaining. A living room is not conducive to happy family living if it is not planned for every member of the family, regardless of how beautiful it may be. LIVE WITH COLORS THAT KEEP YOU HAPPY Color is the most important single factor to be considered in decorating your living room. With color, you can create beauty and add charm and personality to an otherwise drab and dreary setting. Scientists have proven that the colors we live with have a definite influence on our emotions and upon our nervous systems. Before the decorating, familiarize yourself with the various color harmonies and don't be afraid to use them. It is surprising what you can do with a paint brush to add beauty to your room. HOW SHOULD WE FURNISH THE LIVING ROOM? Successful furnishing of any room requires careful planning. This will include making a list of all the furnishings which are needed�furniture, floor coverings, draperies etc., their approximate cost, and the order of their importance to the overall plan. In most cases, a budget has to be considered. When the cost of the room furnishings exceeds the available funds, the most important things should be considered first, and budget-stretching substitutes can be sought to fill the other needs. 1. By purchasing unfinished furniture with the finishing work done by yourself, you can add extra pieces to your room and obtain individual color effects which have considerable charm and personality. 2. With a little rejuvenating, there is many a chest, table, or chair that would be a worthy addition to your room. Bring down the relics from the attic; visit the secondhand stores, and bring hidden beauty to life at little cost. MAKE YOUR ACCESSORIES COUNT Accessories, sometimes called "tremendous trifles,'' are all those things which put the finishing Lesson Department touches to your room. They can not only add highlights of decorating interest, but they can serve utilitarian purposes as well. However, wise judgment must be exercised in their selection. Use your treasured heirlooms, your valued gifts, and your personal keepsakes as a part of your living room decor, but only if they meet � the following tests, otherwise, they will serve only to clutter the room, rather than to contribute to its harmony: Is it an object of beauty? Is it appropriate for your room? Does it enhance the color scheme? If utilitarian, does it successfully fulfill its function? BON CONCLUSION In our homes, the living room, with its furnishings and the way of life within it, should be a reflection of our lives as we would wish them to be. Through wise planning, careful budgeting, and judicious use of the things which we have, and by developing our sense of good taste through study and observation, we can achieve this end. We can make our living rooms places of beauty where our families love to be. Questions for Discussion 1. How can we best express our own personalities in our living rooms? 2. Are we utilizing what we have to the best advantage? 3. Does my family really enjoy the living room, and is it conducive to the comfort and well-being of every member? Suggestion: An interesting demonstration could be given to correlate with the lesson, e. G., antiquing or refinishing furniture, gold leafing, or the making of slipcovers, and draperies. 867 November 1967 SOCIAL RELATIONS�A Light Unto the World Lesson 5�Do | Live What I Say? Alberta H. Christensen (Reference: A Light Unto the World, Melchizedek Priesthood Manual, 1967-68) Northern Hemisphere: Third Meeting, February 1968 Southern Hemisphere: July 1968 Objective: The Latter-day Saint woman realizes that integrity is essential to all rewarding human relationships. INTRODUCTION The word "integrity" may mean many things to many people. What do you mean when you say, "I am impressed by Sister R.'s integrity" or when you say, "Brother B. Hasn't much money, but he is a man of unusual integrity" or "Mr. T. Has talent but, somehow, I always doubt his integrity''? This lesson will develop ideas associated with similar questions, commenting upon their relevancy to rewarding human relationships. (Class leaders should develop more fully those areas which have greater interest and application for their particular group. ) Class Involvement In Webster's Unabridged Dictionary (1966) and the International Thesaurus, we find many words related in meaning to the character quality of integrity. Among them are the following: rectitude honor uprightness adherence to honesty principle moral strength probity 868 steadfastness sincerity trustworthiness truth-speaking dependability truth-living Question 1. Which of the forelisted related _ words most nearly meet your definition of integrity? 2. Would a number of individuals whom you feel evidence integrity be characterized by one word, or phrase, or is integrity more comprehensive in your mind? Discuss very briefly. THE GOOD AND THE WISE Fortunately, many individuals live and have lived abundantly as to moral principle and constructive service. They are the good and the wise who, through righteous beliefs and by adherence to those beliefs, stand out in bold relief against a background of mediocrity. Some of these individuals seem to be inherently attuned to the infinite. They accept. Divine direction readily and spiritual values are, at all times, paramount to the temporal concerns of their lives. Of such are the prophets throughout the ages. There are other individuals who, likewise, are as beacon lights and inspiring, since their lives are oriented toward the good and the constructive. They have been willing to make whatever personal sacrifices were necessary in order to keep faith with their convictions. Class involvement Following is a _nonchronological, limited list of individuals. Some of them are world known, some regionally known or known only to members of the Church. Relate these individuals and their lives to your definition of integrity. (To class leader: Select one or two of these for full class discussion. Enumerate all those listed as a mental review of familiar outstanding individuals, or list the names upon the chalkboard.) Abraham (Old Testament prophet who left his home in Ur of the Chaldees, to go into an unknown, foreign land, in obedience to a divine directive. He experienced famine and other trials, even to the testing of his faith when commanded by the Lord to offer his son Isaac in sacrifice.) Joseph Smith (Latter-day Prophet whose mortal life was filled with persecution and hardship as a result of his spiritual experiences. His life culminated in a martyr's death.) Martin Luther (German theologian and religious reformer (1483-1546) whose protest against certain practices and principles of Catholicism helped father the Reformation.) Joan of Arc (peasant maid of Orleans (1412-1431) who led the French army to victory in the early 15th century. She chose death at the stake rather than to recant her words or relinquish her beliefs.) Madame Curie (1867-1934) (Polish wife of the French physicist whose experimentation resulted in the isolation of radium. Of her effort she said that she would not cease to work for it as long as she lived.) Mahatma Gandhi (modern patriot leader (1864-1948) in India who gave his life for his belief in the Lesson Department principle of victory through nonviolence. ) George Washington (first President (1782-1799) of the United States, �patriot soldier, dedicated to the principle of personal and _ national honor.) Simon Bolivar (a Venezuelan statesman and patriot (1783-1830), leader of revolt of South American colonies from Spanish rule.) Florence Nightingale (English nurse (1820-1910), reformer of hospital nursing. Her devotion to the wounded in the Crimean war won her the name "Lady with the lamp.'') Albert Schweitzer (recent FrancoGerman doctor missionary (1875- 1965), who spent his adult years serving the underprivileged natives of Africa.) Mary Fielding Smith (1801-1852) wife of Hyrum Smith who was martyred with the Prophet at Carthage jail, Illinois. She is representative of a Mormon mother who met hardship and persecution in Missouri and Nauvoo, and who made the trek across the plains to the West with courage and great faith.) (To class leader: Other persons may be discussed who have application to a particular country, in lieu of the individuals listed.) INTEGRITY VERSUS MATERIALISM The question, "How important are material possessions to one's life?" brings to mind the life and words of the American naturalistauthor, Henry David Thoreau. Integrity speaks out boldly in his writings, for Thoreau believed strongly in the integrity of mind and of the spirit. He felt that far too much emphasis is placed upon material things, turning luxuries into necessities. He said we should simplify our lives to make room and time for living. In his book Walden, Thoreau states that the only wealth is life, and the only luxury worth coveting, is the luxury of integrity. (The 869 November 1967 Relief Society Magazine, November 1962, p. 623.) A life situation which illustrates the virtue of integrity as compared to material possessions follows: LIFE EXAMPLE Visualize the life situation of Lehi, living in Jerusalem 600 years before the birth of Christ. Lehi is a humble, religious man, receptive to the promptings of the spirit and the warning words of the prophets. He, himself, has foretold the coming of the Messiah and preached repentance to the unrighteous citizens of Jerusalem. He has been commanded in a dream to take his family and journey into the wilderness, for an unknown destination. In the words of his son, Nephi, we read: And it came to pass that the Lord commanded my father, even in a dream, that he should take his family and depart into the wilderness. And it came to pass that he was obedient unto the word of the Lord, wherefore he did as the Lord commanded him. And it came to pass that he departed into the wilderness. And he left his house, and the land of his inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and his precious things, and took nothing with him, save it were his family, and provisions, and tents, and departed into the wilderness (I Nephi 2:2-4). The scriptural record does not say whether or not Sariah parted readily with their precious possessions. To most women, an exchange of the comforts of home for the hardships of extended travel in the wilderness would be a sacrifice. The record does state, however, that upon the safe return of her sons from the house of Laban with the plates of brass, she rejoiced, saying: 870 Now I know of a surety that the Lord hath commanded my husband to flee into the wilderness; yea, and I also know of a surety that the Lord hath protected my sons, and delivered them out of the hands of Laban, and given them power whereby they could accomplish the things which the Lord hath commanded them. And after this manner of language did she speak (I Nephi 5:8). No silver, no gold, no precious things! Far more important than silver or gold or precious things, however arduously accumulated, is the integrity of a man or woman who, steadfast in purpose, puts first things first, who is willing to sacrifice the temporal and transient for that which is of everlasting value. Every Latter-day Saint woman should recognize this as truth. Class Involvement 1. How does this life experience relate to integrity, from a woman's point of view? 2. Do you think it would require more courage and sacrifice on the part of Sariah than the Latter-day Saint woman experienced in crossing the plains in 1847? Or than a convert to the Church may experience today? INTEGRITY IN THE HOME Integrity is accepted as basic to a successful home environment. There is no place in the husband and wife relationship for intrigue or deception; no place in the child-to-child relationship for insincerity or misunderstanding, although the mother may need to be constantly vigilant in order to keep the dependability of one child from creating jealousy in another. The home is the place for honesty and sincerity, for they make for moral strength, regard- less of the financial standing of the family. Question a What does it mean to have a friend upon whom you may count, whose commendation is sincere�not a maneuvering for a compliment or a favor? INTEGRITY IN THE CHURCH Every individual holding a position of leadership in the Church recognizes and appreciates the value of integrity in those who make up the membership. Question 1. How essential is it to the bishop to have confidence that delegated responsibility will be carried forth by individuals who are upright and steadfast in purpose? 2. How important is it to have Relief Society class leaders who are at all times dependable? How important is it to have visiting teachers who are likewise dependable? THE UPWARD ROAD The goal of perfection is not easily attained. The steadfast, wise-thinking, triumph-over-self road is a long one. It is beset with many obstacles. For some individuals the handicaps often seem unsurmountable, for others it is less difficult. But for all it is a road requiring patience and understanding on the part of all individuals and all relationships involved. These statements are an appropriate preface for the following words of William Shakespeare and for the questions that relate to that perfection of which integrity is an essential factor: If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been Churches and poor men's cottages princes' palaces (The Merchant of Venice, Act I, Scene IT). _ualis Lesson Department Class Involvement Discuss, keeping in mind this question: are we qualified to pass judgment on the progress another individmaking toward achieving integrity? 1. Is it possible for us to know all aspects of the problems another individual faces? 2. Can we know of another's capacity or limitations in meeting problems? 3. Can we actually know how much progress an individual is making toward her objective? 4. What is the difference between condoning a vice and tolerance of an individual? 5. Are we qualified to pass judgment on others? Relevant to these questions are the following lines: What can they know, who see me stumbling, fall, Of granite heights to which my step aspires? (From poem' Appraisal, by A. H. Christensen.) CONCLUSION Integrity is essential to purposeful living. It is the mainspring for the development of constant effort. One may live satisfactorily, even happily, without the luxuries of an expensive home, art objects, an ample bank account, and other material possessions. But poor indeed would be the life lacking the sincerity of loved ones, the truth-speaking of friends, and the personal satisfaction of endeavoring to keep faith with one's own beliefs. Discussion Use as many of the lesson questions as time will permit. All are relevant. FOR HOME-DOING Ask yourself, "Do I live what I believe and say?" Are you helping your children to see, and reminding yourself, that acquiring integrity of thought and action is worth all effort? 871 November 1967 CULTURAL REFINEMENT Ideals of Womanhood in Relation to Home and the Family Lesson 4�'"'Obedience, the Mother of Success'"' Dr. Bruce B. Clark 'Obedience is the mother of success, the wife of safety." �Aeschylus (Textbook: Out of the Best Books, Volume III: Intelligent Family Living, by Bruce B. Clark and Robert K. Thomas) Northern Hemisphere: Fourth Meeting, February 1968 Southern Hemisphere: June 1968 Note to Class Leader: A consideration of the painting ''To Them of the Last Wagon" by Lynn Fausett, which appeared in the September 1967 Relief Society Magazine, will be a part of this lesson. Objective: To emphasize that a woman should anchor her life in obedience to high principle through loyalty and trust. INTRODUCTION Obedience is one of. The great principles of human living for both life now and life hereafter. First and foremost, we should be obedient to our Father in heaven and to all of his commandments. To break these divine laws is to bring suffering in this life and thwart progress in the life hereafter. Second, we should be obedient to the laws of nature and the universe. To break these natural laws is to invite physical disaster. Third, we should be obedient to the laws of government. To break these laws of the people is to defy the happiness and security of society and violate the rights of others. Fourth, we should be obedient to the laws of marriage and the family, recognizing that we should place the needs and happiness of those we love 872 ahead of our own desires and comforts. To break these laws of the family is to cause unhappiness and threaten the very foundation of civilization. President David O. McKay once said:... Obedience is heaven's first. Law, and it is the law of the home. There can be no true happiness in the home without obedience � obedience obtained, not through physical force, but through the divine element of love (David O. McKay, Pathways to Happiness, Salt Lake City, Bookcraft, 1957, p. 118). The scriptures and history, as well as literature, are filled with incidents illustrating the principle of obedience, not only the positiveness of obedience itself, but also the problems of disobedience. As we review these, we see that, if it is important to be obedient when one is a follower or a child, it is even more important to be obedient when one is a leader or a parent. The follower needs to be obedient to those in authority over him, but the leader has the greater responsibility to be obe-- dient to divine guidance, noble principle, and the ideal of love. For the good leader, including the good mother or father, earns authority through the leadership of love rather than the leadership of fear�that is, through qualities of understanding, personal integrity, high courage, sensitivity to divine inspiration, and respect for every individual human personality. The section covered by this month's lesson contains six selections: first, three poems (by John Henry Newman, Edward Hart, and Clinton Larson) illustrating some of the ideals of obedience; second, another poem (by Tennyson), a short story (by James Joyce), and a drama (by Robert Bolt) exploring some problems of the wrong kinds of obedience or wrong ways of requiring obedience and (in the play) dramatizing the ideal of being obedient to the whisperings of inner conscience. "LEAD, KINDLY LIGHT' BY NEWMAN John Henry Newman (1801- 1890) was one of England's and the world's great religious, educational leaders of the nineteenth century. Among many other things, he wrote several short poems that have become worldbeloved hymns, sung in many churches. One of these is ''Lead, Kindly Light," often called '"The Pillar of the Cloud." Although usually thought of as a hymn, '"'Lead, Kindly Light" is also an excellent, beautiful poem, Lesson Department rich in symbolism. Its central focus is obedience�sensitive, faithful obedience to spiritual guidance. Fortunately, the poem is short so that we can print it in. Full here: Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom, Lead Thou me on! The night is dark, and I am far from home�Lead Thou me on! Keep Thou my feet; I do not ask to see The distant scene�one step enough for me. I was not ever thus, nor prayed that Thou shouldest lead me on. I loved to choose and see my path; but now Lead Thou me on! I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears, Pride ruled my will; remember not past years. So long Thy power hath blest me, sure it still will lead me on, O'er moor and fen, o'er crag and torrent, till the night is gone; And with the morn those angel faces smile Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile. Questions and Thoughts for Discussion - 1. What does the 'Kindly Light' in line one symbolize? 2 What does Newman mean in line three when he says "The night is dark, and I am far from home''? 3. Note how in stanza two the poet reviews his past years, when his faith was weak, and when he lived in worldliness and pride, relying upon his worldly self rather than upon spiritual faith. 4. Note also how in stanza three, after overcoming the worldliness of stanza two, he relies on obedience to the spirit for both earthly and eternal guidance. What does "the morn" in the next-to-last line symbolize? And what is the implication of the last two words of the poem? TWO POEMS' The next two selections in this month's lesson are poems by two 873 November 1967 gifted Latter-day Saint writers. The first of these, "To Utah" by Edward L. Hart, is perhaps the best poem yet written on the westward movement of the Mormon pioneers and the colonization of Utah and adjacent areas. In artistry it is excellent, with a skilled control of those devices that combine to make exciting poetry�rhyme, alliteration, assonance, delayed rhythms, symbolism, varied metrical patterns, with just enough balance between simplicity and complexity to both communicate and challenge. (For those readers 'who do not have a copy of Volume 3 of Out of the Best Books, this poem was printed in full in the July 1964 issue of The Improvement Era. It also won special recognition by the Utah State Institute of Fine Arts in 1963 and has been set to. Choral music by Robert Cundick, Salt Lake Tabernacle organist.) Note how much is woven into the poem. In Section I we have mostly description of the scorching Utah valleys wanted by no one except the Mormons�a scorned people in a scorned land. In Section II Salt Lake City is laid out, the central dream of a new empire, both earthly and spiritual, both temporal and eternal. Section III recalls the varied ways in which the pioneers arrived, with tragedy and joy intermixed in their journeyings, and with a vibrant faith anchored in obedience both to God and to their earthly leaders. Then comes the anguish of Section IV as the saints are threatened with destruction by a federal government that does not understand their faith or their customs; rather than yield they will destroy all 874 BEAUTIFUL HANDY DURABLE A sure way of keeping alive the valuable instruction of each month's Relief Society Magazine is in a handsomely bound cover.

But note their courage, their strength, their determination to be loyal to their convictions and their leaders at whatever cost. Finally, the crisis over, in Section V and VI the building of an inland empire continues�first the physical building, with Salt Lake City serving as the hub of a wheel of expansion from which the saints move outward in all directions along the spokes, obedient to the instructions of Brigham Young; then the spiritual building, symbolized in the erection out of granite of the great temple. The central theme is obedience�obedience to the Church leaders, obedience to conscience, and obedience to God.

The other selection consists of two excerpts from ""The Mantle of the Prophet," a verse play by Clinton F. Larson, who has written twenty other plays based mostly on Latter-day Saint history, Latter-day Saint theology, or other religious subject-matter. Although the excerpts are too long to print here, a few comments on them will undoubtedly be interesting. "The Mantle of the Prophet" dramatizes the anguish of the saints following the martyrdom of Joseph Smith and their eventual rallying behind the great leadership of Brigham Young, President of the Council of the Twelve. The two brief scenes printed in our text show, first the heartbroken resolution of the sorrowing Brigham Young to follow as best he can the leadership of the martyred Prophet and, second (later, lThe southern tip of South America (Cape Horn), around which some sailed instead of crossing the plains. 875 November 1967 during the Conference of the Church on 8 August 1844), the now strong, faith-filled determination of Brigham Young to lead the people westward. Both scenes are filled with the spirit of obedience, to follow the will of God and his earthly prophets. "'DORA" BY TENNYSON The fourth selection in this month's lesson is a short story in poetry, "Dora" by Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809-1892). The poem is included for study partly because its straightforward story will appeal to many readers who are not attracted to more complicated poetry and partly because through it we can explore some significant aspects of obedience. Most of all it presents a father who tried to."'command" obedience in his son and others�with disastrous consequences. Thoughts for Discussion 1. Analyze Farmer Allen's personality and character. 2. Discuss the reasons for William's rebelliousness. 3. What does the poem as a whole tell us about the wrong and right methods for parents to teach obedience to their children? "CLAY" BY JAMES JOYCE The fifth selection is a brilliant short story by the great Irish writer James Joyce (1882-1941). The story has many complexities and rich subtleties, both in artistry and in meaning; but above all it is the characterization of Maria, a lonely woman with a dull, drab life who pitiably yields to every pressure upon her as other people manipulate her as if she were a piece of plastic clay.

Obedience, however, does not mean that we should have no will, no mner strength, yielding to every pressure from without, twisted and shaped like a piece of mud or molding clay. Obedience does not mean loss of individuality, integrity, dignity, and self-direction. In being obedient to those we love, we should also be careful that their desires for us are not evil or petty; for if we have to choose between obedience to God and obedience to man, our choice is clear. "A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS" The last selection in this section on obedience is Robert Bolt's Academy-award-winning drama A Man for All Seasons. Because the play so profoundly and powerfully emphasizes obedience to principle, we include a brief discussion of it here. The play centers around the life of Sir Thomas More (1478- 1535)�statesman, scholar, humanist, and writer during the Renaissance. In public life he was one of the most esteemed leaders of his time, first as a member of Parliament, and ultimately as Lord Chancellor of England. Although More had been a friend of King Henry VIII, he refused to take an oath to the Act of Supremacy acknowledging the King to be the supreme authority of the English Church, a maneuver King Henry felt necessary in or- 877 November 1967 der to circumvent the Pope's refusal to permit him to divorce Queen Catherine and marry Anne Boleyn. More was a_ devout churchman and felt that he could not sign the Act of Supremacy, for which he was beheaded as a traitor in 1535. Thomas More is surrounded on all sides by a world of corruption, conspiracy, compromise, bribery, threats, intrigue, and conflicting allegiances. As one of the characters says, "Every man has his price."' But More has no price! Although a mild and mellow man, he will not violate principle at any cost. He will use every maneuver "within honor" to save himself and his family, but he will not betray his conscience no matter what the consequences. The key to all his actions is obedience to a "clear conscience."' Even when the pressures are massive against him, he will not betray his obedience to principle and conscience. Others may live by the rule "Better a live rat than a dead lion," but not More. Although he has enjoyed the cultured life of a scholar-gentleman, not even imprisonment and the threat of torture will make him compromise his true principles. Friends, loved ones, everybody presses him to compromise, but he will not yield, not even to preserve an old friendship nor save his family from suffering. In their efforts to persuade him his family remind him that he 878 has always told them, "God more regards the thoughts of the heart than the words of the mouth." Margaret pleads, "Then say the words of the oath, and in your heart think otherwise."' But More answers, "What is an oath, then, but words that we say to God?" At the end of the play More is found guilty of high treason and beheaded. At any moment even to the very last he could have saved himself by merely saying a few words. But he dies knowing he has been true to his convictions. This is not only a great play but a play with a great message, as the following "questions for discussion" will help emphasize: Questions for Discussion 1. In planning our lives we need to be wisely obedient, not just blindly, foolishly, or selfishly obedient. In the world are many people who are obedient to the wrong masters and the wrong standards. That is why the moral courage of Sir Thomas More stands out so nobly throughout the play. 2. In our own lives must we sometimes choose between allegiances or the pressures of social groups or customs or even those we love in order to be obedient to the principles we know to be right? 3. Point out some traditions in your own cultural heritage that should be followed and others that should be resisted. 4. Thomas More disciplines his life totally through obedience to the whisperings of his conscience. How do we need to live in order to rely safely upon "conscience" as a guide?
