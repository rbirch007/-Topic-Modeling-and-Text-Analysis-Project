New Year's Thoughts As we close the door on the old year, let each of us look back long enough to count the gifts it has brought. Vividly there comes to us the faces of many Relief Society women and mothers in the Church whom we have contacted this past year. We have been inspired by your courage in facing life's problems and by your faith in the Gospel. Our hearts have been uplifted by this association, for your attitude bodes well for the strength of the Church. For this are we grateful. As we have seen your uplifted faces in worship and felt the power of your testimony, we have been led to contemplate the goodness of our Heavenly Father in allowing choice spirits to go to all parts of the world with the "good news''�the Gospel message�and for the spirit of gathering which came to those who accepted the plan of salvation. The Gospel and the spirit of gathering has greatly determined our very existence in this land at these perilous times. To women elsewhere in the world has come this past year war and turbulence, death and sorrow, which are the aftermaths when the inhabitants of the earth take up arms one against the other. In our prayers that ascend daily let us not forget to remember womankind in foreign lands. Out of all nations the Lord has brought us here to this land of liberty. In this forward-looking year surely it is not too much to expect that there shall emanate from Relief Society women everywhere, in gratitude to our Father, a renewed determination to say with Joshua of old, "as for me and my house we shall serve the Lord". Let us hereby highly resolve that the end of another year shall have found us and our families more prayerful, the testimonies of those near and dear to us strengthened, our will to serve this church and its leadership enhanced, our household keeping the faith. What better or more appropriate way of expressing our thankfulness to our Father for His kind providence? Amy Brown Lyman, Marcia Knowlton Howells, Donna Durrant Sorensen, General Presidency of Relief Society. President Amy Brown Lyman The Relief Society Magazine Vol. XXVII Amy Brown Lyman Present OF NATIONAL Woman's RELIEF SOCIETY OF THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS By Annie Wells Cannon came General President of the Relief Society January 1, 1940, appointed by the First Presidency of the Church. The selection of Mrs. Lyman for president over that great organization numbering over eighty thousand women meets with universal approval because of her continued achievement over the years, her thorough knowledge of Relief Society work, her executive ability and her qualities of leadership. She is a beautiful woman of charming personality, clear in judgment, with a sympathetic heart, the gift of making friends, and assumes the responsibilities of her new position well equipped for its arduous requirements. A true daughter of pioneers, she inherits the sturdy, virile qualities of heart and mind to overcome the difficulties that-beset life's way, seeking with clear vision the forward path of progress and advancement. Mrs. Lyman was born February 7, 1872, one of a large family of children. Her father, John Brown, AMY BROWN LYMAN he was being educated for the Baptist ministry when he joined the Church. His scholarship made him outstanding as a citizen of ability, integrity and influence. He it was who led the company of Mississippi Saints to Pueblo in the summer of 1846. He returned East in the fall and came West again the next year with the pioneers. "John Brown with Orson Pratt stood on the summit of Big Mountain July 19, 1847, and caught the first glimpse had by any of the pioneers of the Great Salt Lake Valley." He was for many years mayor of Pleasant Grove and bishop of the ward. Amy's maternal grandfather was a graduate of the University of Berlin, and her mother, Margaret Zimmerman Brown, combined the characteristics of the practical housewife with the cultural enjoyment of books, flowers and lovely things. Both parents were deeply religious, and in this environment Amy spent her childhood, learning the need of sharing both pleasure and work with growing brothers and sisters in a household of faith. From the elementary schools in JANUARY, 1940 No. 1 4 - JANUARY, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE Pleasant Grove, Amy went to the Brigham Young University at Provo where she had the rare opportunity of living in the home of that remarkable teacher and scholar, Dr. Karl G. Maeser. She graduated under him in 1890. On this occasion, Dr. Maeser presented her with a volume of poems by Sir Walter Scott. She was the only one in the class to receive a gift from the venerable teacher. Her friend, Alice Reynolds, said, "None of us minded; we all knew Amy deserved it." For four years thereafter, she taught in the training school of her Alma Mater; later, she joined the teaching staff of the Salt Lake City public schools where for two years she was a successful and popular teacher. Her education did not end there, for she has never ceased to be both a brilliant scholar and teacher, taking every advantage throughout her life to acquire and impart knowledge. She took additional work at the University of Utah and attended lectures and class demonstrations both at the University of Chicago and at Cornell during her sojourn in the East in 1902-4. The Brigham Young University, her Alma Mater, has noted her outstanding career in many lines since graduation, and in recognition of her attainments conferred upon her the distinguished Alumnus Award. This award she values above price. It reads: "Distinguished Alumnus Award, presented as an expression of esteem for meritorious achievements, which have brought honor and distinction to Alma Mater and inspiration to her Alumni." Only one other woman has received this award, her dear friend the late Alice Louise Reynolds. In 1896 she became the wife of Professor Richard R. Lyman, at that time head of the Civil Engineering Department of the University of Utah and now a member of the Council of the Twelve. This alliance has been a most happy one; sweethearts from their college days, they have been in very fact true helpmates. They are the parents of two children, the late Wendell Lyman and Margaret, wife of Alexander Schreiner, one of America's leading organists. Both were university graduates, and Mrs. Schreiner is a talented cellist. Wendell's daughter, Amy Kathryn, has been Mrs. Lyman's constant care and the joy of their household. The home life of the Lymans is ideal and a charming place for social gatherings. Mrs. Lyman's church work began when she was eleven years old, as secretary of the Primary Association in her native town, and from that time she has been in almost constant service in the various auxiliary organizations of the Church. It was in the Relief Society, however, that her broad field of public service began. She was appointed a member of the General Board of the Relief Society, May 5, 1909, during the last year of the presidency of Mrs. Bathsheba W. Smith, and witnessed shortly afterward a reorganization of the Relief Society, the transfer of the headquarters from the office of Emmeline B. Wells, editor of the "Woman's Exponent", to the new headquarters in the Bishop's Building, and a number of important changes in the functioning of the work. She at once became active on committee work and with her usual energy began to acquaint herself with the history and background and prepare herself for this new service. In 1911, -under the presidency of Mrs. Emmeline B. Wells, she became Assistant Secretary, and in August, 1913, General Secretary, chosen by the president and set apart for this important executive office by President Joseph F. Smith. This office Mrs. Lyman held for the period of Mrs. Wells' presidency, eleven years. Through Mrs. Clarissa S. Williams' term of office, seven years, she held the combined position of Executive Secretary and Treasurer. This secretarial position she filled with wonderful efficiency. When she left the position to become a member of the presidency, First Counselor to President Louise Y. Robison, all the minutes of the Society from March 17, 1842, to 1928 had been copied, indexed and bound in uniform covers. She had assembled historical data covering the period between the Nauvoo meetings and the incorporation of the General Board in 1892. She also left a complete file of bound volumes of stake reports from the year 1913, which is a useful reference of statistical and financial data of the stakes and wards of the Church. Mrs. Lyman also arranged a comprehensive "Ward Record Book". This book automatically systematized and standardized all the mechanical workings of the ward organizations; a similar book for stake records Mrs. Lyman also compiled. These books stand as a permanent file for reference in the wards and stakes. She was also chairman of the committee which under the General Board published the "Relief RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE, JANUARY - 5 Society Handbook". Similar record books and handbook were prepared and adopted in all the European missions during Mrs. Lyman's term of office there. She also held the position of Assistant Business Manager of the "Relief Society Magazine" from 1914 to the present time. During the World War, when the Red Cross under the Government was assigned care of the families of soldiers and sailors under the Home Service Division, training centers were established at the various Division Headquarters for the purpose of training women to carry on the task. Under the direction of President Joseph F. Smith and the General Board, Mrs. Lyman went to Denver with a group of Relief Society workers to receive training in order to be eligible to direct the work for the families of Latter-day Saint soldiers and sailors. She saw the excellent results of the trained social worker and how helpful similar methods would be in the charity disbursements of the Relief Society. From that time, she has made social welfare her major activity and has given years of study and reading to the subject. She has taken special courses in sociology and psychology in addition to the Red Cross Home Service Course and a course in field work under the direction of the Denver City and County Charity Office for the purpose of introducing "case work" for family relief in the Relief Society. She has taught large classes of Relief Society women for many years for the purpose of improving their methods. She has attended a number of sessions of the National Conference of Social Work 6 - JANUARY, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE in many large cities and is considered an expert authority on social welfare. She is at present a member and a past president of the Utah State Conference of Social Workers. Mrs, Lyman was a member of the House of Representatives in the State Legislature of 1923, where she served as Chairman of Public Health. She has served as ViceChairman of the Community Clinic, Vice-Chairman of the State Welfare Commission, on the advisory staff of the County Hospital and is at present Vice-Chairman of the Utah Tuberculosis Association. As a member of the State Legislature and later, she worked constantly for the establishment of an institution for the care of sub-normal children and was appointed a member of the special committee to choose the site for such a school. Mrs. Lyman has been a member of the board of trustees of the American Fork State Training School from its beginning. In recognition of her social work activities, she holds a membership in Pi Gamma Mu, National Honorary Social Science Society of America. She is also a member of the American Association of Social Workers. Mrs. Lyman is listed in ""Who's Who" and has been nationally recognized among leading American and foreign women. She, became a member of the National Council of Women in 1911, and at various times has held the position of Recording Secretary, Auditor, and Third-Vice-President in the Council. She has had appointment by the National President as delegate to three meetings of the International Council of Women: At Washington, D. C. In 1925, at Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia in 1936, and at Edinburgh, Scotland in 1938. The last two appointments occurred while Mrs. Lyman was resident in London, England, where her husband, Dr. Richard R. Lyman, was presiding over the European Mission of the Church, and she herself had under her direction the women's auxiliaries of the Mission. During this time, they visited nearly all of the countries of Europe. Gifted as a conversationalist, a writer and public speaker, she has gathered from her wide experience and extensive travel many rich treasures of thought to impart as occasion requires. Perhaps her leading characteristic is a passion for work and education. A consistent and devoted Latterday Saint, she upholds the Priesthood with reverence and stands for the strict observance of Church standards. Her public talks are gems of thought, logical, sincere, full of sound advice and encouragement. With such a background and a true sense of spiritual values, Mrs. Lyman will grace with dignity the exalted position to which she has been called. <(aey> ee Marcia Knowlton Howells First COUNSELOR By Mary Grant Judd It was characteristic of Marcia Howells that when she was recently chosen as First Counselor to President Amy Brown Lyman in the general presidency of the Relief Society she was greatly surprised. Her personal stock sells low with herself but extremely high with those who know her well. Of this group, I am proud and happy to be one. We first met at the L. D. S. High School, where Marcia was president of her class and 'later vice-president of the student body. Since that time, our understanding of and our love for each other have grown apace. I have watched. "my friend develop from an impetuous school girl, whose high spirits were sometimes hard to keep within bounds, into a mature woman who, though she has kept her enthusiasm, has developed poise, judgment and above all spirituality. At a recent conference of Relief Society workers, Sister Lyman gave some instructions to the sisters as to the qualifications they should develop in their work. So well has Marcia Howells incorporated them in her activities as a member of the General Board that her president might have been speaking of her. Said Sister Lyman: "When you are appointed to a position, first learn what it means and what your duties are. Appreciate the office you hold and take your work seriously. We are aiming in Relief Society to have all women who hold positions live up to the standards of the Church; people admire our standards. Be orthodox Latter-day Saints. Be prayerful, seek the spirit of the Lord and work for a testimony of the Gospel. Have courage; you must have courage in positions of leadership. Give in on the little things that are not so important, but do not compromise on real principles. Keep a sense of humor. If you do that, discouragement will find no place in you. Be sympathetic and willing to help in any way possible. Be truly enthusiastic and friendly. Be well informed, gracious and humble. In short, be builders in action, through humility, through prayer and through God." Marcia was called to the General Board early in the year 1929. She came well qualified for the work, having had a good education, four years' teaching experience, and the development that comes from world travel. Her service in the Church as Sunday School, Primary, Religion Class, and Relief Society worker, gave her an intimate understanding of the work of the auxiliaries. For ten years she has not only ably functioned in the regular work-of the Relief Society General Board, but her special interest in health and social welfare has brought to her special responsibilities. For several years, she has represented the General Board as a member of the board of directors of the Utah Tuberculosis Association. In 1939, she acted as state chairman of the May Day� Child Health Day. She has represented the General Board as a member of the Salt Lake City Recreation Council. She attended the National MARCIA KNOWLTON HOWELLS Service Convention held in San Francisco and also a Social Service Institute at Berkeley. Her interest in social welfare has led her to take special educational courses along social service lines. Sister Lyman says of her work, "Marcia is a natural-born executive, with a great capacity for work. She has traveled all over the Church in the interest of Relief Society and never looks for the easiest assignments. If you give her an assignment you can dismiss it from your mind, knowing it will be well taken care of. She is systematic, a good planner, paying careful attention to detail, and she does her work without fuss or trouble. So much of our work is done in committees, and Marcia is a fine committee woman." In order to get a clear conception of any individual, one must know something of his background. To me it is always fascinating to open the book of the past and find out about ancestors and trace family traits. Marcia Howells came, on both her father's and mother's side, from a long line of sturdy pioneers, but it took a great amount of questioning to draw from her the fact that on both sides of her family her forbears go back to Revolutionary times, and far beyond. The reasons she gave for being hesitant was that she believes what Plutarch said: "It is indeed a grand thing to be well descended, but the glory of it belongs to our ancestors." In other words, don't live on the achievements of some ancestor but make a record of your own. Daniel Knowlton, Marcia's greatgreat-grandfather, was an outstanding patriot of the American Revolution. When his country called, he left his plow in the furrow as "CinRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE, JANUARY - 9 cinnatus of old" and willingly responded to duty. Daniel Knowlton once saved the life of Israel Putnam, one of the commanding officers, at the battle of Bunker Hill. From an interesting old record, "The Knowlton Ancestry," I quote: "The night before the Putnam men marched to the relief of Boston, 'Old Put,' as he was called, was noticed to leave his house and silently walk over to a field adjacent, and there look towards Ashford (where Daniel Knowlton lived) for some little time shading his eyes with his hand. Being followed by a neighbor and asked for whom he was looking, the old General ejaculated, 'Gad, Zounds! Had I only Daniel Knowlton to take with me! He alone is worth half a company, such is his courage and lack of fear. I could order him into the mouth of a loaded cannon, and he would go.'" Such a man you might imagine to be stern and forbidding, but such is not the case. "One day," says the record, "as Daniel was riding past a church at Ashford, he noticed a large crowd congregated about a whipping post, planted in the vicinity, according to the harsh custom of the day. Upon inquiry, he learned that a culprit was to be flogged for non-attendance at church and non-payment of dues. When the sentence was read preparatory to laying on the stripes, observing that the usual clause was omitted requiring the stripes to be applied to the bare back, he jumped from his horse and threw his own coat over the shoulders of the culprit, thus mitigating the force of the blows." "Bold, stern and intrepid as a lion in the battlefield, he was retiring, non-assertive in private life, and inclined to belittle his achieve- 10 - JANUARY, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE ments. Nothing was more distasteful to his mind than display or ostentation." Certainly, Marcia possesses many of the sterling character traits of her ancestor. Courage, loyalty, a spirit of daring, coupled with an innate modesty, humility and a willingness to serve when duty calls are pronounced characteristics. If I were asked to put into words that peculiar something which distinguishes Marcia from other individuals, I would say it is the quality of her generosity. She gives herself. She is generous with her time, doing more than her share when called upon. She is generous in her thoughts of others. Their good fortune evokes happiness within her; their accomplishments calls forth her commendation. She is tolerant of their failings. Modest about her own talents, she recognizes and admires the talents of others. If working in a successful group, she is inclined to give the credit to the other persons, a true form of unselfishness. Though but ten years old when her father, Benjamin Franklin Knowlton, died, the example of true hospitality set in his home has stayed with Marcia, making her the charming hostess she is today. As a little girl, she recalls there were no auto camps or even hotels in the little town of Farmington where she grew up, but the shelter of their home and the bounties of their table were generously and freely extended to even the casual acquaintance. The home over which Marcia and her husband, Dr. Thomas J. Howells, Salt Lake City Health Commissioner, preside is an inviting one; hospitality, refinement, peace and harmony reign therein. Dr. Howells has not only ably served his community but his Church as well. He fulfilled a mission to Great Britain and upon his return was appointed a member of the Salt Lake Stake Sunday School Superintendency. Marcia's spiritual nature has found expression in extensive temple work. Genealogy and temple work were activities in which both her father and her mother, Minerva Richards, found great satisfaction. Her mother said shortly before her death: "The crowning joy of my life was the privilege of serving as an ordinance worker in the Salt Lake Temple." For many years Sister Minerva Knowlton was a devoted and capable Relief Society leader, being chosen secretary-treasurer of the first Davis Stake Relief Society. Later, she became ward Relief Society president. This position was followed by that of stake president. Of her mother, Marcia could well say, as President Grant did of his widowed mother: "It is a glorious thing to be, like Nephi of old, 'born of goodly parents.' It is of greater value than wealth or precious stones. My mother was both father and mother to me. Her tender love bound me to her with cords of steel, and if I succeed in the battle of life, I will owe it all to her." In our high school days, I formed a high opinion of the character of Marcia, and during all the years of our friendship she has not disappointed me�no, not once. Donna Durrant Sorensen SECOND COUNSELOR By Anna Boss Hart "I AM ready to go anywhere, provided it be forward." These few words of David Livingstone embody the philosophy of Donna Durrant Sorensen's life. Since the time that her parents, the late Lorenzo J. Durrant and Agnes Lewis Durrant, came from Thatcher, Idaho, with their family to educate them in a church school at Provo, Donna has been going forward. Forward in her education, for in 1927 she was graduated from the Brigham Young University; forward in the Gospel, for two years were spent in the Central States Mission under President and Sister Samuel O. Bennion whose faith and leadership were exemplary; forward in her profession of teaching as head of the Department of English and Speech in the American Fork High School; forward in every woman's crowning activity, that of homemaking, for October, 1929, saw her marriage to a worthy companion, a graduate from the Utah State Agricultural College, Wesley A. Sorensen, a man valiant in the service of the Church. A little, curly golden-haired daughter graces this ideal union. Since her marriage, the Church and her home have found the largest interest in her life. As the windows of their beautiful home offer varied views, so within their lives do we view happiness and well-ordered living, friends in an atmosphere of peace and beauty, with love and faith permeating everywhere. Not only is her home the expression of her generous, artistic and religious nature, but her appearance as well. Beauty, in all its forms, attracts her attention, whether it is found in dress, in an etching, a sunset or a new flower arrangement. With all her public work, she has time to cheer those who are sorrowful, to write a letter, to send a flower ora card, It is not possible to express the deep admiration felt by her friends. Some "thoughts lie too deep for words". Her friendship is "the breathing rose, with sweets in every fold". She is alert to the new, knows valuable books, hears the best music, knows international problems of the day. In all available pursuits, "she has a genius for enjoyment". The power and richness of her radiant personality characterize everything she does. She can make a delicious pie, can sing a lullaby and sway an audience with the same perfection. Probably the secret of Donna's success is in the entire giving of herself, her never failing sympathy, her' sense of humor that can relieve any difficult situation and the intensity of the life she lives. Her sense of values�"the ability to see large things large and small things small", which is one of the true measures of education�shows an outstanding harmony of powers. Above all, she is a true Latter-day Saint. Her great faith has been exercised in behalf of many. Fostered in a home of faith, her testimony has constantly grown along with her ser- DONNA DURRANT SORENSEN vice. She has been an inspirational teacher and has taught in most of the auxiliary organizations. Not until she taught in a ward Relief Society did Donna find the greatest satisfaction in Church activity. Later, she became a member of the Wells Stake Relief Society Board, and since then greater honors have come, and rapidly. In 1935, when she was selected as a member of the General Board, her teaching RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE, JANUARY - 13 received a new crown, and her leadership included wider realms. And now, the future holds great promise for this young woman, for with her humility and earnest seeking of her Father in prayer will come limitless vision, To President Amy Brown Lyman she will bring trust and unquestioned loyalty and the will "to go anywhere, provided it be forward". [eee Vera White Pohlman GENERAL SECRETARY By Amy W. Evans VERA WHITE POHLMAN comes to the office of General Secretary and Treasurer of the Relief Society well qualified for the position. There are very few who possess such a thorough knowledge of the history, rulings and policies of the Organization as she. This knowledge was gained during twelve years as an employee of the General Board of Relief Society, from April 1, 1920 until September, 1932. From 1920 to 1926, she was private secretary to Amy Brown Lyman, then General Secretary. After her marriage, Mrs. Pohlman served in various part-time capacities and on special assignments, which included work with the Editor of the Relief Society Magazine, clerical work in the Social Service Division at the onset of the depression, and more especially, historical research and assistance to Amy Brown Lyman and Annie Wells Cannon in the preparation of. The Relief Society Handbook. During this latter period, she went extensively into the original minutes and documents of the Society, beginning with its organization in Nauvoo. To show how painstaking her work was, as she read the minutes, she not only made notes on policies, rulings and procedure but made a list of the members as they were admitted, meeting by meeting. Thus, she obtained the names Of all who joined the Society in Nauvoo. This list is published in the Relief Society Handbook. The minutes of the Organization after the establishment of the Church in Utah she read in the same careful way. The Woman's Exponent, the official organ of the Relief Society and of the women of the Church from VERA WHITE POHLMAN 1872 to 1914, contained many articles of historical value and also records of procedure and rulings of the Society. Mrs. Pohlman spent much time going over all the volumes of this publication, culling relevant information. She typed and indexed all the minutes of the Relief Society from its beginning in 1842 until 1928. Another valuable service she rendered was the checking of rulings, historical data and procedure for the Relief Society Handbook. She gave efficient and valuable help in gathering and compiling the material used in this book. In September, 1932, Mrs. Pohlman accepted full-time employment in the Salt Lake County Department of Public Welfare, which was then expanding rapidly due to the unprecedented extent of unemployment and distress, and the availability of 'the first federal funds for relief. In this position, she organized the recording and filing systems, and supervised a stenographic and clerical staff of twenty workers until the end of 1933. In January, 1934, Mrs. Pohlman went into the newly organized State Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) as. Statistician. When this emergency organization was succeeded by the creation of a permanent State Department of Public Welfare in 1935, she was appointed director of its Bureau of Research and Statistics. In this position, she was a member of the administrative staff of that Department, and contributed much to the development and establishment of its policies and procedures, and to the training of personnel in this new function of state government in Utah. Soon after her appointment, she devised RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE, JANUARY - 15 and introduced into every County Department of Public Welfare in Utah a uniform and effective system of statistical recording and reporting relating to the various types of public assistance administered by the Department of Public Welfare, including those provided under the Federal Social Security Act. An important function of her position in the State Department of Public Welfare is the interpretation of facts and figures, and the analysis of trends in public welfare. Her success in this field has been outstanding. With a flair for historical data and accurate detail, she has gathered the facts available regarding the growth and development of public welfare in the State of Utah, which have been published in the First Biennial Report, recently released by the State Department of Public Welfare. Of this publication, written and edited by Mrs. Pohlman, the following statement was made by Mr. Louis E. Hosch, Technical Consultant for the American Public Welfare Association, in his public address before the Utah State Conference of Social Work held in Salt Lake City, November last: "Your State Public Welfare Department here has just released one of the most excellent and interesting reports ever published by a State Welfare Department. The first half of this biennial report contains an excellent description of the organization and administration of the services you support through taxes. This section is carefully documented and interestingly illustrated. The latter half of the report contains more accurate detail about expenditures and accounts than you will probably find for any other service of your government." Mrs. Pohlman is also the author of the comprehensive published An- 16 - JANUARY, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE nual Report, 1934, of the Utah Emergency Relief Administration, and of the regular monthly bulletin Public Assistance in Utah, which she initiated and which is now in its fifth year. During the summer of 1935, at the request of the regional supervisor of research projects for the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, Mrs. Pohlman was granted leave of absence by the Utah State Emergency Relief Administration to go to San Francisco where she edited the findings of a survey by Margaret C. Klem on Medical Care and Costs in California Families in Relation to Economic Status. In 1936, Mrs. Pohlman represented her state at the annual conference of the American Public Welfare Association in Washington, D. C. And gave a paper before the section for relief statisticians as the representatives of the Intermountain Region. In 1938, she accepted an invitation to appear on the program as discussant in the section for social statisticians at the National Conference of Social Work at Seattle, Washington. En route to fill this assignment, she represented the State Department of Public Welfare at the Ninth Corps Area Conference of selecting agencies for the Civilian Conservation. Corps at Portland, Oregon. Mrs. Ruth B. McIntosh of Denver, Colorado, Regional Representative of the Division of Public Assistance Research of the Federal Social Security Board, expressed her appreciation of Mrs. Pohlman and her achievements by saying: "It is my personal feeling that the National Woman's Relief Society is to be congratulated on the appointment of Mrs. Vera W. Pohlman as its Executive Secretary. Mrs. Pohlman has had the reputation throughout the nation of being one of the most outstanding State Directors of Research and Statistics of a Public Welfare Department. Because of her knowledge of the welfare field and sound methods of service, and her cooperative attitude coupled with her capacity to analyze welfare problems from all angles and her sound judicial approach, this appointment will, I am sure, make for a real contribution not only to the Relief Society but to all welfare activities of the State." Mrs. Pohlman is leaving her position in the State Department of Public Welfare to accept the secretaryship of the Relief Society. Mrs. Pohlman is a descendant of Utah pioneers. Her maternal grandfather, Charles A. Harper, was a member of the company that entered Salt Lake Valley, July 2, 1847. Her parents, George F. And Eleanor Harper White, went to Nevada temporarily, and Vera was born there. They soon returned, however, to their home in Cottonwood, Salt Lake County, where she was reared. She and her husband, Francis J. Pohlman, have always been active in Church work. A secretary of Sunday School, a special home missionary, a ' teacher in Y. W. M. I. A. Are some of the positions she has held. They have two young daughters, Marilyn and Patricia. With her natural ability for details, her experience in welfare work, her fund of information regarding and thorough understanding of all phases of Relief Society work, her faithfulness to trust, and her dependability, Mrs. Pohlman will make a very efficient and valuable General Secretary. The Highest and Best in? Woman's Realm By President David O. McKay (Conference Address, October, 1939) THE great responsibility I have sensed since having accepted this invitation to speak to you this afternoon is now compensated in the inspiration I receive from looking into the faces of this vast audience of Relief Society workers, and the privilege of hearing once again the Singing Mothers. I congratulate the Presidency of Relief Society, members of the General Board, and all workers upon this manifestation of interest in this great organization. Whenever I hear the Singing Mothers I have a re-confirmation of my belief in the saying that music is one of the four fundamental needs of the human family�first, nourishment; second, shelter; third, raiment; fourth, music. MOTHER "The sweetest smile we've ever seen Lingered at the golden eventide On that fair face, kind, and serene That watched at the cradle side. "The dearest song we've ever heard, Lulled us to our first rest, Haunted us when we had erred And inspired us to do our best. "The truest heart that ever beat Was ever sad when we were sad; Bore the brunt of our first defeat And was so glad when we were glad. "The noblest deed that e'er was done Was wrought in the unending day By her who served in storm and sun, And kissed our childish tears away." These lines, penned by one of our own townsmen, pay a merited tribute to mother, and inferentially to that basic unit of civilized society, the home. They indicate also the trend of my theme this afternoon as I say a few words on the topic, "The Highest and Best in Woman's Realm". Though woman's life is filled with almost everything which is good and lovely, it is not difficult to choose the two activities that are paramount in her world. In one sense, it is inaccurate to speak of a woman's world and a man's world, because the two are inseparably one. In general, they have the same interests, the same hopes and aspirations; the success or the failure of one is the success or the failure of the other. They share each other's joys, bear each other's burdens, and work together to achieve success. I repeat, in the broad sense of the word therefore, there is no such thing as woman's realm and man's realm. There is only one realm in which each contributes his or her effort toward the attainment of a desired destiny. Woman's realm is as unlimited as man's. One writer has said: "They talk about a woman's sphere as though it had a limit; There's not a place in Earth or Heaven, There's not a task to mankind given, There's not a blessing or a woe, There's not a whispered yes or no, There's not a life, or death, or birth, That has a feather's weight of worth� Without a woman in it." However, when the divine Cre- 18 - JANUARY, RELIEF SOCIETY
MAGAZINE Creator "made them male and female" he established as distinct a difference between man and woman in temperament, in natural tendencies, and in the field of activity, as he did in sex; the most sublime beauty and the greatest harmony in life are attained when the man devotes his life to that for which nature has endowed him, and the woman puts forth her best efforts along the lines for which she is best fitted. It is a matter of deep concern that social and economic conditions today are enticing if not forcing women out of the sphere in which she herself can find the most happiness and can render the greatest good to mankind. ONE winter's night about fifty years ago in a humble country home in a little town in Utah a mother was taken sick. Three children sat around a table in a room lighted by an old-fashioned coal oil lamp. The father was away from home on business. The mother who had been ill during the day had taken a turn for the worse. The nearest doctor was twelve miles distant through a canyon. There was no telephone communication and no other practical means of reaching the doctor that night. The mother said to the eldest child, a lad of six or seven, "I think you had better go to Sister Smith's and ask her if she will please come over for a while." The lad crossed the street to the barn, bridled his pony and rode through the newly fallen snow four or five blocks distant. Mrs. Smith was alone attending to household duties in the kitchen. When she heard that the lad's mother was ill, she took off her apron, stepped into the bedroom, presumably to see that her own little ones were snug and comfortable, threw a shawl over her head and shoulders and trapsed along in the steps of the lad's pony, holding her skirts as best she could to keep them from trailing in the snow. Arriving in the home, she rendered such service to the ailing mother as only skilled and willing hands can give. The children were ushered to bed and were soon asleep, unmindful of the number of hours that Mrs. Smith spent at the bedside of the stricken woman�she was a Relief Society worker. The lad grew to manhood before he realized the beauty and significance of that little incident�a mother acting in the role of an angel of mercy. I relate this because in simplicity it illustrates the highest and best in Woman's Realm�Home Making and Compassionate Service. UNFORTUNATELY, modern fashion and the trend of the times are leading her away from realms in which her influence is most potent. In the struggle for existence, and in aspirations for success and fame, the boundary lines today between woman's realm of activity and the man's are much less discernible than they have been in the history of the world. The rapid changes that have taken place during the last half century in our economic life have pushed women into nearly every industry. For example, in 1910 there were about eight million women in the United States engaged in some form of gainful occupation. This means that a little more than onefifth of all the wage-earners in the country were women (21%); also, that of all the women in the country ten years of age and over, somewhat over one-fifth were wage-earners (23%). During the forty years preceding 1910, the proportion of the total male population ten years of age and over who were gainfully employed increased 3%, while the proportion of the female population so employed increased from 9%. "Thus, not only is the proportion of women gainfully employed increasing rapidly, but it is increasing more rapidly than is the number of men employed." (U. S. Census 1910, Volume on Occupations, p. 30). "Not only has the number of women wage-eamers increased very rapidly, but also the number of occupations which women enter has increased even more rapidly. When Harriet Martineau visited America in 1840, she reported that she found but few employments open to women � teaching, needlework, keeping boarders, and household service. Although woman's activities were probably not quite as limited as this, they were very few in number. From that time to the present, woman has entered into many and varied occupations. At the 1920 census, of the four hundred twenty-eight occupations __ listed, women were found in three hundred eighty-five. Of the one hundred sixteen principal occupations, women had entered all except those of conductors, motormen, brakemen, firemen and engineers, soldiers and sailors, plumbers, policemen, and street laborers." (Social Problems� RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE, JANUARY - 19 Towne) (From a census taken in 1930 by the United States Department of Labor�Women's Bureau, Published in 1938). "In the United States, according to the census of 1930, there were over 10,700,000 women workers gainfully employed. There are few occupations in which no woman ever has worked. In twelve manufacturing industries women opetatives and laborers outnumbered men in both 1920 and 1930. These include the clothing industries as a whole, silk mills, knitting mills, cigar and tobacco factories, and candy making. "According to the 1930 census there were in that year over 3,000,000 married women workers. This means that only slightly over one married woman in ten is gainfully occupied, though well over three in ten widowed and divorced women, and five in every ten single women are so employed. Of all women gainfully occupied in the United States, the census of 1930 shows that only about 29% were married, about 17% widowed or divorced. A decided majority of all such employed women were single." It seems to me that there is something askew with a social system which compels so large a percentage of women to wage earning at the expense of home keeping. Do not misunderstand me, I have no objection to women entering the fields of literature, science, art, social economy, of study and progress in all kinds of learning, of participation in any and all things which will contribute to the fullness of her womanhood and increase her upbuilding influence in the world. 20 - JANUARY, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE ONE of the greatest needs in the world today is intelligent, conscientious motherhood. It is to the home that we must look for the inculcation of the fundamental virtues which contribute to human welfare and happiness. Touching this subject, a leading columnist, a woman, writes as follows: "What every woman who is sensitive and conscientious knows�and she may know it even if she isn't conscientious, feeling it in her bones �is that in the America of today, as elsewhere in the world, there is sterility in human relations, in the family, in the state, an atomization, loneliness, frustration, lack of warmth and justice, hatred, cleavage, shrillness, mechanicalness, heading toward new disciplines, which will not be self-imposed but coerced. And crying through the times is a gasp after the organic, the living, the vital, the human: Richness, not in income, but in the imponderables of life, such as serenity, faith, warm emotion, protectiveness, charity, affirmation, and even common sense! For what is common sense except sense and community, the individual and society, the person and humanity, not in contradiction, but in union, organically united, as th family is, or once was? "Some day, when women realize that the object of their emancipation is not to make them more like men, but more powerfully womanly, and therefore of greater use to men and themselves, and society, this implicit demand and need of women for a world based, not on mechanical but on human principles, may break through as the most important influence upon history, and bring with it a renaissance of liberalism and humanism." Another eminent writer has truly said: "Woman's mission and throne is the family, and if anything is withheld that would make her more efficient, useful, or happy in that sphere, she is wronged, and has not her rights." Motherhood is the greatest potential influence either for good or ill in human life. The mother's image is the first that stamps itself on-the unwritten page of the young child's mind. It is her caress that first awakens a sense of security; her kiss the first realization of affection; her sympathy and tenderness the first assurance that there is love in the world. True, there comes a time when the father takes his place as exemplar and hero of the growing boy, and in the latter's budding ambition to develop manly traits he outwardly seems to turn from the more gentle and tender virtues engendered by his mother. Yet, that ever-directing and restraining influence implanted during the first years of his childhood lingers with him and permeates his thoughts and memory as distinctively as perfume clings to each particular flower. In more than one instance in the life of fiery youth, this lingering influence has proved a safeguard in the hour of temptation�an influence greater in its restraining power than the threat of the law of the land, the ostracism of society or the fear of violating a command of God. Thus�  "The mother, in her office, holds the key Of the soul; and she it is who stamps the coin Of character, and makes the being who would be a savage, But for her gentle cares, a Christian man. Then crown her Queen o' the world." WOMANHOOD should be intelligent and pure, because it is the living life-fountain from which flows the stream of humanity. She who would pollute that stream by tobacco, poisonous drugs, or by germs that would shackle the unborn, is untrue to her sex and an enemy to the strength and perpetuity of the race. The laws of life and the revealed word of God combine in placing upon motherhood and fatherhood the responsibility of giving to children not only a pure unshackled birth but also a training in faith and uprightness. They are to be taught "to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the Living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands when eight years old". To those who neglect this in precept and example, "the sin be upon the heads of the parents". (Doc. And Cov. 68:25). There seems to be sweeping over the nations at the present time a wave of disbelief in God, of disregard for agreements, of dishonesty in personal as well as in civil and international affairs. 'There is a reversion to the rule and law of the jungle in which might makes right. David Harum's silver rule, "Do unto the other fellow what he wants to do to you, and do it first," too often supplants the golden rule, "Do unto others as you would have others do unto you." Political poison is being administered to the youth of America by advocates of Communism professedly RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE, JANUARY - 21 interested in fostering liberty, peace, and democracy, but who insidiously attempt to influence youth associated with the National Youth Administration, American Student Union, and various other organizations. In an article recently printed in a current magazine appears this statement: "There are a great many more young Communists in universities in this country than most of the adult population even dares to realize. That is because parents do not bother to ask their children what their beliefs are." There is one effective source which can counteract such teaching, and that is the teaching of an intelligent, Christian mother. The times cry for more true religion in the home. NEXT to motherhood, woman attains her highest glory in the realm of compassionate service. One of the most impressive incidents in the Bible is the story told of one to whom I apply the title, "A Relief Society Sister of the Ancient Church," whose life was full of "good works and alms-deeds which she did. Her name was Tabitha, which by interpretation was called Dorcas," (which means gazelle�beautiful). This story is told by Luke: "And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber. "And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them. "Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the 22 - JANUARY, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them. "But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up. "And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive." (Acts 9:37-41.) This scene implies the kind, helpful service rendered by the women in the Ancient Church. A desire to render service to the wounded, sick, and dying gave to the world one of the most potent organizations among nations today. I refer to the International Red Cross Association. Its beneficent tree that now sheds its fruit on all lands sprang from the seed of love and compassion in the heart of Florence Nightingale. But the most beautiful, and undoubtedly the most efficient organization in the realm of service is the National Woman's Relief Society. Through this channel, your myriad deeds of mercy sparkle like gems in a coronet. "To chase the clouds of life's tempestuous hours, To strew its short but weary way with flowers, New hopes to raise, new feelings to impart, And pour celestial balsam on the heart; For this to man was lovely woman given, The last best work, the noblest gift of Heaven." In conclusion, let me emphasize that woman's realm is not man's realm, though equally important and extensive. Greatest harmony and happiness will be found when womankind is helped and honored in the sphere in which God and Nature destined her most effectively to serve and bless mankind. In the words of Tennyson: "Woman is not undevelopt man, But diverse: could we make her as the man Sweet Love were slain: his dearest bond is this, Not like to like, but like in indifference. Yet in the long years liker must they grow; The man be more of woman, she of man; He gain in sweetness and in moral height, Nor lose the wrestling thews that throw the world; She mental breadth, nor fail in childward care, Nor lose the childlike in the larger mind; Till at last she set herself to man, Like perfect music unto noble words; And so these twain, upon the skirts of Time, Sit side by side, full-summ'd in all their powers, Dispensing harvest, sowing the To-be, Self-reverent each and reverencing each, Distinct in individualities, But like each other ev'n as those who love, Then comes the statelier Eden back to men: Then reign the world's great bridals, chaste and calm: Then springs the crowning race of human kind, May these things be!" God bless you mothers � home builders�angels of mercy! � May. Your influence continue to spread and your sweet, tender services bring comfort and consolation to those in need I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

WB Woman as an Interpreter of the Faith | By Maude B. Jacob "They serve God well who serve His children." WOMAN'S service to humanity lies in her place in the continuance and care of life. Without such care, human life and everything built around it would perish from the earth. As generations have passed and with them the conflicts that promoted or retarded the progress of civilization, the influence of woman has been found at the center of things. Because of the significant nature of the influence of woman, its spiritual basis, there has been kept alive through the ages the enduring belief that it is good to live and to love, to strive and to serve. Human life is the most precious possession possible to any individual. The sacredness of individual life lies not alone in its physical entity but in the fact that as a spiritual entity man is offspring of God, capable of attaining eternal happiness. Whatever encourages a disregard of the value of the individual, impels mankind to dominate others by physical force, incites hostility, engenders strife, cultivates enmity, or curbs intellectual freedom, increases the destructive tensions influencing individual progress, On the other hand, whatever directs and assists the development of the individual in the way of its highest destiny is a constructive influence upon the life of the individual and upon human society. Jesus brought this understanding of the sacredness of the individual to the world. In His direct teachings, His actions and His parables, always the relationships of life were a deep concern. To let man know his relationship to God, to his fellows, to life itself, that all of life might be brought nearer to the "one far-off divine event to which the whole creation moves" was the mission of Jesus. A passing glimpse at the history of Christianity brings to us an understanding of how slowly the Christian Church learned the true significance of the teachings of Jesus. The intellectual structure of monasticism grew out of the objective of giving the sacred scriptures to mankind. In seclusion and often in affluence, Biblical scholars spent their lives in copying, explaining, and publishing the scriptures and sacred literature. When the wealthy young Francis of Assisi turned from his evil ways, he sought, as did many others, refuge in the church. Following the admonition of Jesus to the rich ruler, Francis, too, sold his goods and gave his wealth to the poor. He saw Jesus teaching the multitude on the hillsides of Galilee or with the humble fishermen in their boats. He saw the concern of the Master for the poor, the sick, and the wrongdoers. Going to Rome, he sought the permission of the Pope to conduct a mission as did Jesus. The permission was granted with reluctance, as it might cast 28 - JANUARY, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE some reflection upon the monasterial life of the times with its intellectualism and its ceremonials. Returning to Assisi, Francis gave his life to the service of the peasants of the countryside, teaching them of God's love and the laws of life. The service of Father Damien to the lepers of Molokai is one aftermath of the growth of the spirit of Francis of Assisi in Christendom. For years, this valiant Christian missionary strove to direct the hopeless sufferers of the leper colony, the drunken and licentious mode of living into which they had sunk to drown their sorrows. The results were disheartening. Then came the _ day when stricken with the dread disease Father Damien stood before the lepers calling them "his brothers". From then on, the colony grew in faith and in righteous living. Thus, the secret of service lies revealed to us; service that is not reform, not "housecleaning" in its nature or spirit. It is the service that accepts sincerely the responsibility for the welfare of others; it is service given with kindness and due respect for the individual. Such service is the product of altruism, altruism that is "a genuine regard for the welfare of one's fellows, accompanied by a sincere desire to render them constructive and beneficent service without thought of or desire for special benefits or personal gain''. It is the spirit that was behind the gift of the widow's mite. It is the spirit that has directed women through the ages in the care of life. AS generations have passed, woman has been found at the center of human affairs. During the period that has been called "the dawn of history", side by side with her mate woman labored to provide food, shelter, and security for her offspring. It is over twenty-three centuries ago that the wife of the Greek philosopher, Pythagorus, encouraged the women of her time to accept the truth that they were always near the heart of things even if they were barred the Forum and the Temple. Medieval civilization, molded in part by Christianity and in part by Chivalry, developed around woman. She often joined in wars, owned and managed estates and worked in the crafts that built up the trade guilds, as she sought to make life more secure and more beautiful. For her actions and convictions we find her punished as witch and as heretic. In her quest for knowledge with the growing intellectualism of the modern age, it mattered little to her to be the subject of the jests of the male scholars of the day or that she was barred from the halls of learning. One remembers, too, that the great scholar Abelard sought the intellectual companionship of Heloise; that Queen Isabella of Spain sponsored Columbus when kings and statesmen denied his appeal; that Mary Wollstonecraft joined Thomas Paine in the vindication of the rights of man. In this modern age, the influence of woman has extended from the home to society. In the complexity of our life today, we have become so dependent upon the life of others that no longer is a woman's responsibility for the care of life bounded by the walls of her own home. Therefore, no conception of a woman's influence in the world of today is complete unless her public as well as her home influence is considered. Her quickest response has always been to human needs, because of her intuitive appreciation of the sacredness of the individual. The area of woman's service is limited only by human need. Through her influence, the needs of dependent, defective and delinquent humanity are receiving greater and more effective service than ever before. By such woman-motivated movements as Anti-Slavery, Temperance, Woman's Suffrage and Child Labor Prevention, society has been refined. Through the individual leadership of such heroines of service as Jane Addams, Florence Nightingale, Mary Lyon, Dorothea Lynde Dix, Elizabeth Fry, Anna Howard Shaw, Clara Barton, Susan B. Anthony, Frances Willard and others, many phases of human need have been met. Through organization in clubs, churches, settlements, welfare stations, playground and recreational associations, civic and social centers, legislative halls and schools, women have held in their control the care of life through refining the activities of governments, institutions, organizations and individuals. In recognition of her services in the care of life, it is agreed "that it has become the spiritual function of woman to point the way to a higher civilization". NEVER has the general welfare of humanity been a matter of such grave concern as it is today. Society is in need of refining and reorganization in light of the general acceptance of the Christian ideal of the worth of the individual. The general inability of society to meet the impacts of the forces that are molding contemporary life has addRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE, JANUARY - 29 ed to the tragedy. Because of the experience of the immediate past, the care of the dependent, aged and unemployed is receiving attention. But the greatest problem confronting society, the welfare of its youth, is the gravest of all our problems. Maxine Davis in her thought-provoking book, "The Lost Generation", written after interviewing thousands of young people in all parts of our country, has many significant comments pointing out to women this great challenge: "The youth of the nation are the trustees of posterity. "Youth today brings to its solemn charge the same high hopes, the same zest for work, the same will to achieve, the joyous love of life and romance which has characterized it since the beginning of time. "Our boys and girls have grown up in the belief that America is the Land of Promise. They grew up with the assurance that education and hard work were the Open Sesame to respectable joys secured by reliability and perseverance, to homes of their own and to honored places in the eyes of their fellow men. -, "In the past few years many of them have found that this is not true. About three millions of our young people who are out of school today have no work, through no fault of their own.... "Bleakly our youth has been marking time while the clock ticks away its bright years, the good years of plowing and sowing and striving.... "More:�They have seen us abolish heaven and outlaw hell. They have watched us set up money as a god, and then watched the god topple. They have seen us distribute 30 - JANUARY, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE fame as generously to Al Capone and Huey Long and Mae West as to Woodrow Wilson, Einstein and Jane Addams. "They have seen poverty and starvation overtake men and women who have toiled faithfully all their lives.... "What has all this done to them? "Some of the things:�Life is empty.... Life is boring..... The movies are becoming as essential to today's youth as cocaine to an addict.... They identify themselves with Hollywood stars, living vicariously.... When they can't go to the movies they listen to the radio.... Thus the movies and radio are insidious drugs coloring the life of youth. "In the minds of many, the drinking and smoking of modern youth is an obvious escape.... "Another tragedy to your youth is their inability to marry, a cause of untold misery.... Again:�What of the habits of mind and attitudes of this lost generation straying aimlessly toward middle age?" As women of today, the challenge comes to us, because ours is the responsibility, inseparable from the continuance of life, the care of life. As Latter-day Saint women, from the spiritual experiences of our people we may find inspiration and guidance for our task if we but search sincerely and pray fully. THE story of the early settlement of Kirtland is a record of how God's leaders were directed by revelation to care for the human welfare of their people. In one of the revelations we find the counsel: "You must remember in all things the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted." In another: "Let every man deal honestly and be alike among his people, and receive alike, that ye may be one, even as I have commanded you." The Saints at Kirtland lacked many of the comforts of life, but the blessings they had in living together as God directed were very great. To the Saints, God's Prophet was always "Brother Joseph"�they knew how much he loved them. Many of the choicest memories of those who knew the Prophet at Kirtland were of his kindness and helpfulness. Further, during the spring of 1847, Elder Lorenzo Snow was called to take care of the exiled Saints camped at Mt. Pisgah, east of Winter Quarters. Many of the families were almost destitute. Then, too, there was a great deal of sickness in the camp. Many died and were buried without ceremony or burial clothes. To arouse the Saints, poor, sorrowing and discouraged, was the first task of the new leader. First, Lorenzo Snow encouraged some of the men to go to near-by settlements to get work, others he started repairing and building wagons, and others he set to work making chairs, 'barrels, churns, etc., things that could be sold. Then he sent two elders to Ohio, where the Saints still had many friends, to collect money to help the Saints. They brought back six-hundred dollars. This provided many necessities as well as food and clothing for the days to come. But the greatest joy of all was that the Saints at Mt. Pisgah were able to send a wagonload of provisions to President Young and his camp at Winter Quarters as a New Year's gift. Thus, sympathy, vision, work and play changed a discouraged camp into a courageous, resourceful people ready for the trek West. From two of the most valuable records of the Church, "The Life Story of Brigham Young" and "William Clayton's Journal", we note how closely the great leader, Brigham Young, kept in touch with the everyday life of the Saints during the trek West and the early days of the settlement of Utah: "May 22, Bluff Runs. President Young called the camp together and spoke to them, 'For the past week the - whole camp has been card playing... Then, too, there have been disputes over nonsensical things. Swearing and profane language is being used in camp. You are men going to find a location for the Saints of God. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE, JANUARY - 31 Then some of you will go out to preach the Gospel.' " Thus was guided the lives of the Builders of Zion. It is through accumulated good that the everlasting life of man is builded. By seeing the qualities of things, their claims and their places, the women of the Church may know their task. By diffusing the spirit of the Gospel in all the contacts of life they may become the purifying, humanizing and spiritualizing forces of the society in which the youth of Zion is being nurtured for their great heritage as God's children. This in itself is the highest of all womanly functions, the care of life, and is nobler than anything which art, philosophy, genius, or wealth may produce. WB ANOTHER YEAR By Mildred B. Hall God gave me twelve full months of time, Another year to use as mine; But I was blind and could not see The value of this legacy. Through spring's awak'ning I lay mute, And summer time bore me no fruit, The pageant passed that was the fall, And suddenly I saw it all, My year had died, God called it home; I hold its ashes tenderly, alone. If God will grant this gift once more, Another year to me restore, I pledge my heart and hand to be Of service to humanity. Not by some deed of great display, Just in a quiet, humble way; I'll give a smile, or wipe a tear, To heal a hurt or calm a fear. I shall not ask of life for fame, If God will grant Another Year, again. Custer's First Stand By Gertrude LeWarne Parker "YOU'D better come, in case } we need you," the Widow Bentley said over the phone, and John Custer, with a shake in his voice, answered, "I'll be right home. Take good care of Margaret." But the receiver on the other end clicked before he finished speaking. As he raced homeward, his thoughts went back to the time two years before when he and Margaret Bentley, finding themselves very much in love, had pleaded with the Widow Bentley for her consent to a little home of their own. Weeks before this, they had wandered through every furniture store in town, had planned living-rooms of bright chintzes and soft gray rugs, had ordered dishes, all white with embossed rose design, and gay green and orange pottery for the kitchen. Then, as he had listened to the Widow's side of the story � with Margaret clinging to him, smiling through her tears�he had realized how lonely her house would be without Margaret. "But," he had reasoned, "other daughters have married, other mothers have been left alone." Slowing down for a traffic light he remembered, too, that afternoon when he and Margaret had sat on the piano bench, their arms around each other, facing Mother Bentley. The Widow, stern and unbending, had said as a parting stab, "Margaret's an ungrateful daughter to even want to leave me alone so soon after poor Pa's gone." He thought again of Margaret's whispered sob, "Couldn't we, John, stay just a little while?" He recalled his half-hearted surrender and promise that they would move in with her mother and try that arrangement for a while; now, today, he realized more than ever what a mistake it had been. As the car slid to a stop at the back gate, he pushed his hat back on his bristling red hair topping a pair of bright blue eyes that twinkled in fun at less serious times than this. He got out and reached for the box of yellow roses in the back seat�was glad he had thought of them. It hadn't delayed him more than a minute or two. She loved them so. He hurried up the path to the back door, forgetful of the garden which lately had called forth a daily snort of disapproval�a maze of prim flower beds and narrow winding paths all edged with jagged malicious-looking rocks; not one patch of grass where a boy and a dog might roll and tumble. Instead, the whole thing fairly screamed, "No children or dogs allowed." For two years John had been making what he called "a back-door entrance". The front part of the house was kept sacred to the memory of "poor old Bentley" as he was generally known around town. He had been so pitifully pleased that, "You've never caught me tracking up your front porch, Mother." John did better than that�he didn't track the back porch. He wore rubbers according to the calendar, even on days like today. He figured it saved a lot of stupid argument. In spite of his evident haste, he remembered them now and placed them side by side on the top step and wiped his shoes on the mat. He listened anxiously before opening the door. Entering the old-fashioned kitchen, he hung his coat and hat in the kitchen closet, washed his hands at the sink and carefully wiped off all traces of any splatterings on the wall. With one frightened glance at the unusual appearance of the room, he tip-toed along the ribbon of spotless rag rug which stretched the length of the floor, In gayer moods it had been a tight-rope, and he had pranced across it wildly waving a frying-pan as balance. Other times it was the "straight and narrow" with Margaret as "temptation" atop the kitchen table.: Such doings didn't go on long though. "We mustn't forget poor, dear Pa," Mother Bentley would say. And now, she sat in the next room dolefully rocking and waiting. Her hair, thin and streaked with gray was twisted into a wad and skewered to the back of her head with large steel pins. Her spectacles were rimmed with steel. A dress of oldfashioned gray-striped calico was fastened about her throat with a brooch which held a lock of "poor, dear Henry's hair".. Over her dress, in deference to the occasion, she wore a stiffly starched white apron, the one bright spot in the darkened corner where she liked to sit after the last speck of dust had been ousted. As John approached, she anticipated his anxious question by saying curtly, "She's all right. Flowers? Put them in water. You'll find a fruit jar on the back porch. I'll take them in later. You'd better sit down. We'll likely have a long wait." RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE, JANUARY - 33 Sit down and wait? No! He could take it better standing. He went into the kitchen�paced up and down the strip of rag rug, pulling up sharply in front of the table to look again at the terrifying array of instruments thrown carelessly on a pink-striped towel. Going to the stove, he poured more water into a pan which held other necessities of the sick-room. A feeling of utter helplessness surged over him, a fear that he hadn't known before. All the joy of the last few months was lost in the agonizing present. He turned sharply toward the door, listening. Perhaps Margaret had called him. Perhaps she wasn't able to call�never would call again. No. No! It couldn't be as bad as that. Such things did happen to other people, but it couldn't to her. But he must know. He went quickly and quietly into the other room. "Has she asked for me?" he whispered, fearfully. "No, she hasn't. She's resting just now. I'm right here if she calls." She gave him a withering look. "Sit down. I'll be going in again in a few minutes." ALTHOUGH the packed stuffiness of the room was almost unbearable, he did want to be near if Margaret called. He sat gingerly on the horsehair sofa. It seemed to John that hours passed while he sat among the cushions�six or seven of them �all crammed to the bursting point. He took one, gave it a vicious punch right in the middle of its clamoring red roses, threw it aside with a disgusted, "Nope!"" He repeated the attack on a bunch of orange daisies, then threw that on the floor, and so on until all were in a pile. He 34 - JANUARY, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE sat glaring at them, mumbling, "Nope, not one in the whole bunch." The rocker had stopped squeaking. He glanced around. The Widow stood watching him. "John!" she snapped in a hoarse whisper. "What are you doing?" "What am I doing?" He looked at her long and steadily with eyes that were almost hidden under a heavy frown, scratched his head, rumpled his hair. "Me! Oh, I'm trying to find a tumbling-mat." She sniffed, sat down, settled her long bony frame and started the rocker squeaking again, muttering ~ to herself, "Sometimes he makes me think of poor Pa�silly answers with no point to 'em whatever." A trained nurse came into the room and filtered her way into the kitchen, stopping long enough to speak to the woman in low tones. For John, she had nothing but a glance of pity mingled with some disdain. He knew what she thought and agreed with her that his place was in the bedroom with his wife. But he and Margaret had talked it over. They had decided that he would wait outside, forestalling any possible or probable clash in opinion. He smiled as he thought of what 'Mother Bentley would say, in the event he should go into Margaret's room: "I'll never be able to face the ladies at the missionary meeting again. Why, even poor Pa would have known better than that!" Today brought the culmination of what John termed "intensive preparations in pink". And anything pink was more or less of a sore spot with him. He knew it was foolish, and childish, too. It brought back a harrowing memory of small schoolboy stuff. He groaned as he thought of it again. He had always felt that if his mother had lived she would have understood his yearning, all the fierce longing of his boyish heart, for high-topped boots, overalls with patches on them, and more than all, a "real feller" nickname. He had wanted to be hailed up and down the street as "Hi, Red!" but the Aunties had kept him so clean and dressed-up that the kids had called him "Pinky". Sissy name! It made him want to fight, to push their faces right to the back of their heads; but nice little boys didn't fight the Aunties had said. AFTER more seemingly endless hours, the doctor stood before him. "It's a boy," he announced. "The mother's fine, too.", John Custer's heart swelled with relief, while his lips formed a prayer for pity: "Heaven above," he breathed, "a boy in this house!" In a few days, routine again settled down in the Bentley household� that is, as far as John knew. His meals were always ready. There was plenty of time to read his newspaper. It wasn't a bit like the boys at the office said it would be. He was never asked to fix a little hot water for the baby, to bring the baby's washing in from the line, or to "hold this blanket over the register a minute". He'd have been glad to, even the pink ones. He thought amusedly one evening, "I ought to bring the efficiency expert from the office up for a squint at this layout." Little whimpers came from the bedroom. John crept in for a look at his family, but always there was somebody about to be doing something for either mother or baby. It was always, "Would you please step out a minute? I'll call you when we're through." They never did. Telephone conversations irritated and amused him at the same time. The Widow always sounded to John like a busy executive who had just put over a big deal. "Doing nicely, thank you," she would say, crisply. "The pink blanket is so nice. We want to thank you for the bootees.. They are lovely. Pink seems to be his color." On one occasion, as the Widow came back to the kitchen, John remarked, "The reports are quite pink, aren't they?" She stopped, faced him, and saw again that half-defiant, half-amused look in the narrowed blue eyes. Later that same evening, John sat thinking, planning, dreaming dreams. It was pretty fine to be the father of a boy like that. In a little while they'd be tumbling on the floor together. The boy would be riding pickaback. He'd get him a puppy, take him fishing, teach him to shoot. He'd give him the things he himself�The telephone again! He snorted, "Another pink report." The Widow answered. "Yes. Both fine, thank you." She paused, listening. "Well, yes, we have. Margaret wanted to call him John." Another pause. "Yes, for his father, but we finally decided to name him Henry. Yes, after poor, dear Henry." Silence while she enjoyed her moment of melancholy; then, "Goodby. Thank you for calling." As she turned from the telephone, John's face was close to hers, his eyes blazing, one hand waving a rolled newspaper, his voice rising in spite of his efforts at self-control. "Henry? Henry?" he shouted. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE, JANUARY - 35 "Where do you get that stuff? Whose baby is this, anyhow? Who says he's going to be Henry?" "Why, John!" she stepped back a little. "Don't get so excited. It's this way�I promised Pa that if we ever had a grandson I'd name him Henry." John gave her a searching look, his jaw set at a stubborn angle unusual for him. He turned away with a shrug and started for the back door. "Poor Pa!" he said as he slammed the door behind him. The Widow went after him, yanked the door open, "What do you mean 'poor Pa'?" He turned on the top step and looked at her. "Oh, nothing. I was just thinking, he might have been a girl, and then you couldn't have named him Henry." The idea tickled his sense of the ridiculous, and he roared with laughter. Another backward glance showed the Widow still curiously watching. He caught her muttered words, "Now what's the sense in an answer like that? Drat the man, more like Pa every day!" SHORTLY before noon the next day, John parked his car at the front gate and strode up the path to the front door. He raised the oldfashioned knocker and banged furiously. Both women came running. The key turned, and John burst into the gloomy old house like the first March wind, kissing Margaret's cheek lightly as he passed. He went through the clutter of the front room, back to the kitchen and for several minutes rummaged through the kitchen closet, grumbling and swearing under his breath because he couldn't find what he wanted. 36 - JANUARY, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE Finally, he found it and went into the bedroom. He stood for a moment looking at the curly head peeping out of the blanket. Clumsily and tenderly, he lifted the baby, took off the hated pink trappings and wrapped him tenderly in a muchloved old sweater of his own. With just a wave of his hand and an airy "We'll be back," he went the way he came, scarcely seeing Mother Bentley as she stood dumbfounded, warily waiting. Margaret, happily intent. At the window watching father and son going down the street, could not see the look of grudging admiration stealing over her mother's face. For an hour they waited. Then he came. Giving the baby to his wife and holding them both close in his arms, he said, "My son and I have been to the courthouse. His name is legally recorded as John Arthur Custer, Junior. Sounds great, doesn't it, Margo? On the way home we stopped at old Jan's, the. -out of the old sweater. Shoemaker, and ordered a pair of red-topped boots." He held up a tiny foot that had kicked its way "See how he's growing. It won't be so long until he can wear them." John pulled a chair toward Margaret. "Sit down, dear. There's something else, too. I've made arrangements for us to go to see those new bungalows at Laurelhurst tomorrow morning. Junior will be all right with your mother for an hour or so. And, Mother Bentley," he turned to her, his blue eyes alight, "while we are gone, bundle up all this pink stuff. Give 'em away. Burn 'em. Anything. _ Only get 'em out of my sight." Margaret put the baby in his basket while tears of happiness fell on the beloved old sweater. With a rush of tenderness, her arms were around him. "Oh, John!" she whispered. "It's worth waiting two years for!" fo INCONSTANCY By Afton Clegg Yesterday it snowed, And all the still brown earth Dreamed happily of sunshine And white blossoms.

THE MAGICAL VOICE By Bess Foster Smith
A magical voice keeps repeating to me, "Unlock your own prison; I give you the key."
"Before you a castle of happiness gleams, With halls of contentment and beautiful dreams."
"O what is the signal that opens the gate?" I ask all a-tremble to know my own fate.
The magical voice says, "Believe it is true, Your faith swings the drawbridge so you can pass through."
Cathedral of Peace By Dorothy Clapp Robinson
SYNOPSIS
Carolyn Evans in her early married life had parked her mind beside the highway of Life. Now, in middle years, she suddenly realizes her husband Turner Evans has gone on and is almost out of sight. Despairing of ever overtaking him, she has thought half-seriously of Kane Holland and divorce, thinking that would solve her problem. She sounds out her son Bob Evans on the subject, and he comes back with "�good grief, Mother, be your age." She had counted on her eldest son to understand, but she was not so certain of her second-born Carson who, while resembling his mother in looks, had none of her quiet reserve; no one could ever predict what particular note he would strike at any given time. On the morning the story opens, Turner had refused to take Carolyn with him to a convention at Crystal Springs. Hurt and bewildered, she had fled to her CATHEDRAL OF PEACE, a cottonwood grove in the lower pasture of the ranch. To her there comes Kane Holland, indignant for her and offering her a way out. Shocked, she leaves quickly. On the way back to the house she meets Bob. Bob is in love with June Straughn but will make no advances to her because of the condition of their home. Bob's inference that his mother is a doormat arouses Carolyn's determination to do something about her situation. Divorce or not, Bob would never have occasion to speak to her in such a manner again. She will accept the opportunity recently offered by Mrs. Straughn and asks Bob to drive over to the Elkhorn to tell her as much. Turner Evans, irritated by the ever widening breach between himself and Carolyn and baffled over a solution, releases his feelings by a curt manner toward Bob. He orders him to locate Carson who had been sent hours before to repair the east-line fence. Carson is in ill humor and confides in Bob that he is tired of conditions at home and is leaving. "Watch your step," warns Bob and turns his horse toward the Elkhorn to deliver his mother's message.
As he crosses the river, he notices a figure sitting astride her horse, watching.
As Bob's horse splashed noisily out of the stream, he noticed a girl on the bank. She also was astride a horse.
"I am glad you came across there," she called gaily. "I have been wanting to cross there but wasn't sure of the depth."
"It's safe," he answered, embarrassed by the unexpectedness of her. "Earlier," he added, "it is dangerous if you don't know the stream, but not for long."
The girl was watching him closely. "You are Bob Evans, aren't you? I am June Straughn. We live here." She indicated the meadows and fields.
As if he didn't know. As if every boy in the valley didn't know June Straughn by sight. As if in spite of the few times he had seen her, there hadn't already been a bond forged between them. Yet, he was surprised that she knew him.
"How�how did you know me?"
She laughed, unaffectedly. "Who could miss a man your size? I often see you working or riding. You know our place is slightly higher, so I can look down on you�literally, I mean."
A quick fear checked the warm glow that was rapidly engulfing Bob. He opened his lips to speak again, but his tongue was tied. He thought angrily, "Why can't I be free and easy as she is? Why don't I tell her I have been living for this minute, that having had this minute I shall never be the same."
She noticed the warm color that spread over his face and neck. "He is perfectly lovable when he blushes," she thought. Aloud she said, "I've ridden over most of the ranch, but I haven't crossed the river. Is that the only ford?"
In some ways she was like Garden Semple. Garden could quickly put one at his ease, as this girl could; but there was such a difference. This girl's gray eyes were frank and shining. There was no deviousness in them. She spoke naturally and not for effect. The clearness of her countenance came from lack of clouding experiences. Life to her was clean and sweet and fine. Bob's chest swelled.
"I have asked you three times if this was the only ford?" She was frankly puzzled.
"I�I was thinking of something," he offered as an apology. "Did you want to cross?"
"Perhaps. The land over there doesn't belong to the Elkhorn, does it?" "That is ours, except farther�"
"I was just riding," she volunteered when he did not go on. "It is a little lonesome here. I have never lived where distances were so magnificent. It sort of destroys the feeling that you have neighbors. People seem," she hesitated slightly, "well, they seem a little unfriendly."
"They are afraid of you."
Her eyes widened in surprise. She started to laugh, but the laugh ended in a sigh. "Am I that awful?"
"You are perfect."
The moment the words left his lips he blushed again at his own boldness. Who was he to say such things to her!
"Thank you. I hope I have not been snooty. I had no intention of it. Am I keeping you?"
"No. This isn't the only ford. In fact, it isn't a ford at all, any more than a dozen other places. There is one farther down. Want to see it?"
"I'd love to, if you have time."
Just then, he had all the time there was. He had quite forgotten the yearlings that were to be moved. Blissfully conscious of the moment, he turned his horse east. They crossed a field belonging to the Elkhorn, and opening a gate, went through it onto a narrow dirt road. They followed it south as it rambled along near the foothills; then it turned sharply to the west and toward the river.
"Who lives here?" she asked indicating two small ranches, one on either side of the road.
"On the left is Dave Gorton. He is a young fellow only a year or two older than I. He is trying hard to get on his feet."
"And on the right?"
"That's Semples. The ranch belongs to Jed Taylor. Mrs. Semple is his sister." His tone closed the subject.
Then the road twisted through trees and willows and met the river only a short distance below where he and Carson had gone swimming.
"It crosses here and goes over to meet the highway. The road, I mean," he explained. "Here's the ford. The water isn't deep, but the bottom of the stream is quite rocky. Don't you go this way to town?" he asked.
"No. Bridge." She pulled sharply at her horse's reins to turn him close to Bob's horse. As she did so, the pony stepped on a loose rock and slipped. Instantly, Bob reached out and caught her with one arm. At once the horse regained his footing, but the touch of her body stayed with Bob. Emotions, new and exciting, surged through him, blinding him to everything except one fact�here was his world, here was the sum of his hours and his days, the reason for effort.
"What a beautiful lane," she said, breathing quickly, alive to the tantalizing odors and sounds of a virgin spot. The road pushed back the undergrowth for them to pass. "I love the fragrance of wild roses, don't you?"
For answer he turned his horse and, leaning, broke a spray that had on it four large blossoms. He handed it to her without speaking, and without speaking she accepted it.
"This is our line," he said a moment later, pointing to where he and Carson had been fixing the fence. He was trying to think coherently. "See the cottonwood grove up there? The big one? We call that Mother's. She goes there often."
"Where? Oh." Her voice dropped to such a flat note Bob's eyes turned from her.
Just getting on his horse after fastening the gate was Carson; near, already in the saddle, was Turner Evans. He was watching their approach.
Instantly, Bob squared his shoulders. He had forgotten about the steers. This was a choice chance for Dad to show off. If he even as much as tried to get nasty�miserably the boy realized he could do nothing about it. He could not even turn about and avoid an encounter. It was too late for that.
"Hi, June," Carson called with easy familiarity as he caught sight of them.
"Hello." She waved in answer as they neared the gate.
"This," Carson indicated the man on the horse, "is Dad. Know him?"
Bob swallowed. How did Carson get that way. Nothing daunted him. Then his father spoke, and warm drops of moisture rolled down Bob's face in relief.
"Miss Straughn." Turner had raised his hat. "I believe I met you one day, in town. You were with your father."
"I remember now. For the moment I had forgotten. Bob didn't tell me you were his father. I might have known. You look so much alike."
Bob was so relieved he failed to hear what else was said. He glowed with pride in his father. No wonder he went over so big with people. And here he had been expecting to be told off about the yearlings.
Half in a daze, he watched the two ride off through the pasture.
"Don't forget the errand," Carson called back.
"What did he mean?" June asked when the two had disappeared in the trees.
"Huh? Oh, I had a message for your mother."
"Shall we go back?"
Reluctantly, Bob turned his horse. They started back the way they had come.
"Your father is very capable, isn't he," June stated rather than asked.
"Daddy thinks so. He is going to talk at the Convention isn't he? Are you going to hear him? I think I shall go up for the second day's meetings. Dad thinks it will do me good to get in on some of the discussions. The idea is to win more sympathy for some of his problems. I suppose you will go?"
Bob did not answer. For a moment he was happy in the thought of his father; then immediately he was conscious of sharp resentment. Why wasn't he going to hear his father? Come to think of it, he could if he wanted, except that he was supposed to look after the place. But Mother should be going. More to turn his own thoughts than for any other reason, he said, "I didn't know you knew Carson."
They were emerging from the shadows of the trees, and he could see her face. Some of the light had gone from it.
"Didn't he tell you? I met him several weeks ago, one day after church when we were waiting for our fathers. He's charming."
When they were again above the river, she looked about at the valley that now lay in shadow, at the hills where the light still lingered.
"Some time before the hills get dry we will ride through them," the boy said, after a prolonged silence. "In the winter we ski down that slope." He pointed.
"Grand! But then I shan't be here, very likely."
"Not here!" he echoed in alarm. "Why?"
"School. However, Dad says I can't go unless Mother gets better help. There are so many of us and so much to be done."
"Do you want to go?"
How could she want to leave now that they had met?
"Well, you see, I just have one more year. Besides there is�there are my friends."
"One in particular?"
She nodded, slowly.
The magic of the evening had gone. They left their horses in the yard, and as they went up the walk to the Elkhorn ranch house Bob felt, as he had earlier in the evening, the power of strength and humility. An absent friend needn't count. When people were meant for each other nothing else counted.
The door ahead was open, and there was a light on in the room. Mrs. Straughn was in a low rocker with her baby on her lap. As they approached, Bob saw Mr. Straughn stoop to take the child. In the act of lifting him, he turned and placed a lingering kiss on his wife's upturned face.
Bob stopped short. He glanced at June, but she was composedly opening the screen. To her there was nothing unusual about the scene. Bob was profoundly moved, not by the act alone but what it stood for�the connotation of love and peace and unity within. The magic of it stayed with the boy�the magic and the tragedy. For he vowed in his idealistic but shortsighted way that he would never ask a girl from such a home to marry him. Her disappointment in his people would be too great for him to bear, and it would not be fair to her. She was one kind, and he was another.
Instead of bringing finality and peace with it the decision set him apart in a world by himself, a world of aching indefinable longing and unrest. Instead of going home he turned his horse to the hills. He wanted to be alone with his bitter-sweet ecstasy. Once there came to him the vision of his father there by the gate. Nothing was lacking there. Dad had been all one could hope for. There was less difference in their fathers than in their mothers. Mothers were the ones who made homes and dealt with�with son's wives.
On returning home, he went in through the kitchen door. He turned on the light and explored the ice box.
"Is that you, Bob?"
"Yeah."
Then he thought suddenly, "What is Dad doing in that room?" The living room ran the width of the house across the front. Back of it, on the north side, were the dining room and kitchen. The south part was divided into two bedrooms, with a connecting door. The larger one was the parents' room. The smaller one opened off the kitchen; in it all the boys had slept until they were old enough to be moved upstairs.
Startled, Bob looked up and saw his father standing in the door of that room.
"Where have you been?"
"Riding."
Turner seemed to be hunting for words. "I want you to watch the timothy in the upper field. You might have to start mowing before I get back."
"You going tomorrow?"
"No, the day after." He turned, then hesitated. "I like to see you with such girls." He closed the door behind him.
Bob considered. Dad stayed awake to let him know he approved. Good old Dad! Then abruptly, he lost his taste for food. Why was he sleeping in that room? He went upstairs and with each step he grew more angry. Such people! Was this a result of the fuss they'd had this morning? Little things, unnoticed before, came to his remembrance. This might have been going on for years for all he knew. The scrap that morning hadn't been anything unusual. Mother was pretty stubborn when she made up her mind. He undressed and in bed tried to sleep, but his eyes refused to close. Mother's talk to him this morning began to take on sinister meaning. Perhaps she was justified in wanting to leave. Maybe it was too late to remedy the situation. Maybe she was in love with Kane. He groaned aloud.
"For cripes sake," Denis called from the next room. "Quit threshing around and go to sleep. You'd wake the dead."
Denis was the thirteen-year-old. He was small and puny and a light sleeper.
Bob forced himself to lie quiet. After interminable hours, he fell into a fitful sleep.
The next day Bob watched his parents furtively. There was nothing different about their attitudes toward each other. The knowledge brought a hollow feeling into the pit of his stomach. So it was serious, serious enough that a fellow wouldn't dare ask a girl to go steady, even. Marriage was inconceivable. One had to give something in return. A girl like June would expect a great deal in return, not a background of divorce.
When his father drove away to the annual Stock Growers Convention, Bob watched him with a bitterness of spirit that took many months and many events to completely eradicate. Why should he be going alone when other men were taking their families�anyway their wives. As on the previous morning, he watched his mother, and now he saw a fine, white line about her mouth. So, she did care. She could be caring about a whole flock of things of which he knew nothing. He looked at her in sudden comparison with other women he knew would be there. Not so good! Dad was proud, and he looked plenty good. "What has come over me?" he thought. "Mother is top line." Then again he thought, boldly this time, "She could still be Mother and be a little different". It was confusing and discouraging.
THE second day of the Convention the Evans family sat at their noon-day meal. The radio was on, for Denis wanted to hear the news.
Suddenly, Bob was galvanized into instant attention.
"�special announcement of local interest. Yesterday we told you of the splendid address given by T. L. Evans before the State Stock Growers Association. This morning Mr. Evans was elected president of the association by an overwhelming majority. Mr. Evans, who is a very successful stock grower, is here; we are going to ask him to say a few words."
"That's my Daddy," Jerry cried, as her father's voice came into the room.
"I want to hear him. I want to hear him." With a clatter, Judy thrust her dinner aside and with hands against the table pushed her chair back. But Jerry was at the radio before her.
"Quiet," Denis demanded. "I want to hear what he says."
"President, eh?" Carson beamed. "That's my Dad. I'll tell the world he is going places."
Carolyn had picked up a dish and hurried to the kitchen. Bob kept his eyes on his plate. He didn't want anyone to see the misery in them.

NOTES FROM THE FIELD By Julia A. F. Lund
THE General Office takes this opportunity to say to all the Field, "1940�may it be the happiest, most prosperous year Relief Society has ever known!" The gratitude of the officers goes out to the capable, devoted women who have carried on and have sent in the interesting accounts of activity from all parts of the world.
Nampa Stake
SISTER LILLIE LOGAN supplies us with the following report from Nampa, one of our youngest stakes. It demonstrates fine cooperation in putting over the Nutrition lessons: "A very interesting program and demonstration was held in the Second Ward L. D. S. Chapel at the August Union meeting. The program was presented by children taking different health parts. A table was beautifully decorated with fruits, vegetables, whole wheat and milk products. At the opening of the meeting, little children marched in, representing carrots, milk, oranges and baskets of vegetables. Small boys displayed the proper food for school lunches � sandwiches of whole wheat bread, milk products, milk and fruits. Proper breakfast foods were also demonstrated� whole wheat grain, cereals, eggs, milk and fruits. After this, a group of small girls marched in and sang "The Vitamin Song". During the singing, a group of pictures containing the different vitamins was placed upon the wall back of the children. Miss Frances Gallatin, the District Home Demonstration Agent, gave an educational lecture on nutrition and daily food selection, explaining the effect of proper and improper eating on white rats, using the pictures for illustrations. She gave the value of milk products, vegetables, whole-grain products, meats and eggs. The family budget was also explained."
South Sevier Stake
UNDER the capable leadership of President Jetta Marquardson, this enterprising stake has done many excellent things, not the least of which is the organization of the Singing Mothers shown in the accompanying picture. The effect of the work of this fine group has been felt in every part of the community. Not only has it furnished music for stake and ward functions but for the Manti Temple also.
Oquirrh Stake
THE reports from Oquirrh indicate activity in every field of Relief Society work. One of the interesting features is the record made by some of the visiting teachers. Spencer Ward is unique in this. The picture is of Helma Jenkins and Harriet Jenkins who have been visiting teachers for eighteen years and haven't missed a month visiting their district. Living in a rural community where distance is a problem, these two good sisters have for the past two years included two districts in their calls. Among the new recruits to Relief Society, we show the pictures of the two youngest members in the stake �Phyllis Jones Arnone, nineteen years of age, and Lola Knight Jenkins, just eighteen years old.
Wells Stake
THE Jefferson Ward reports unusual success in its visiting teaching program. Comprising twenty-eight districts, it has for the past three and one-half years achieved a record of one hundred per cent visiting teaching. The work has been done by a group of sixty-two teachers among whom may be found some interesting individual records of service: Sister Patrea Latimer, in her seventy-fifth year, has been a Relief Society member for fifty years. Sister Rose Anderson is the widowed mother of thirteen children yet renders outstanding service as a visiting teacher. Equally interesting things could be told of many others. The one-hundred per cent record has not only been achieved in the number of visits made but also in the quality of work done.
San Bernardino Stake
SOME of the very fine creative work of the Relief Society comes to us from a report of the activities of the San Bernardino Relief Society. For the 17th of March program, the stake suggested that each ward present a pageant in poetry and provided an outline. The pageant reviewed the Organization from the beginning to the present, depicting the spirit of its founders, the faith and courage of those who have carried on during the past century, and the promise which the future holds. It was written by Evelyn Wilde Heath and was a very fine contribution. "The Apostolic Review", also written by Sister Heath, was presented in each ward as a conclusion to a very successful year's work in Theology. It summarized the glorious mission of the men who "walked and talked with Jesus" and emphasized the importance of their mission to us. It was very much appreciated.
MORMON HANDICRAFT Highlights By Nellie O. Parker
There has dawned another new year in which to shake off the shackles of disappointment and failure, a year in which to step out with fresh courage and enthusiasm, tempered but unhampered by the mistakes of the past, toward higher goals. It is the time for stocktaking, for sorting out true values, for measuring accomplishments, for restating objectives and extending plans for the future.
In this new year, Mormon Handicraft will reach its third anniversary. Its history is one of consistent, steady growth and is a concrete expression of the true spirit of Relief Society. It was conceived in an earnest desire to help others to help themselves, not only to replenish their income but also to increase their joy of living through self-expression. It was felt that this shop would help retain the fine skills and craftsmanship that many of our people brought from their native lands and that it would encourage and foster these talents in others. If a market were available for these individualized hand-made articles, new avenues of employment would be opened.
Up to October, 1939, approximately 2,500 people have sold their articles through Mormon Handicraft and $14,278 have been paid to them for their work. Truly, this is rendering genuine service. The Organization has been fully justified, and the dream of its founders has materialized. From these achievements we feel that the future holds great possibilities, and we trust that the same inspiration and vision will guide its course onward to a great destiny.
Attractive Historic Samplers
There are now available through the facilities of The Tribune-Telegram patterns for a beautiful sampler of Mormon scenes and motives, artistically grouped on a sheet 15x20� inches. These patterns have been carefully designed with regard to historic accuracy and simplified for many types of needle work, cross-stitch, lazy-daisy, etc., and for novelty work, modeling, dry-point, woodcarving, tooling, etching, etc. They may be divided into separate motives to be used in numerous ways for decorations on luncheon sets, wall plaques, glass painting, etc. The patterns can be obtained at the Shop, ten cents per sheet.
MUSIC DEPARTMENT
The Emotional Content of Music and Its Effect Upon Tempo By Wade N. Stephens of the Tabernacle Organ Staff
THE emotional effect of music unknown to the listener depends chiefly upon three things: Variations in tempo (speed), variations in dynamics (loudness), and variations in tone-color. The present article is concerned with the first of these.
Observe that while it is important to start a piece at an effective tempo, it is variation from that speed that is important in interpretation. Although transition of mood into tempo is not reducible to strict rules, it is possible to learn in a general way how to decide upon a tempo for a given piece, and where to change the speed effectively.
To define a tempo mentally, we must compare it with other tempos. Let us set three speeds as standards. Each reader should now get a baton and set a "slow" tempo, a "medium" tempo, and a "fast" tempo. Each one may have different speeds, but that does not matter. These speeds will serve as standards for the one who sets them.
Now each reader must select a tempo to express "grief". Which of the standard speeds is it nearest? Most conductors will find that they have chosen a speed very near the "slow" standard. A tempo selected to express "joy" will be found to be very near the "fast" standard, and a tempo to express "contentment" is likely to be "medium".
When a large number of people set tempos for a given emotion, the results are surprisingly uniform. They indicate that the more joyous the mood, the faster the tempo, the more sorrowful the mood, the slower the tempo.
Not only can the initial speed be determined in this way, but the small variations in tempo that are part of a good interpretation and an effective performance can be worked out by following in minute detail the changes in emotion expressed by the words.
Sometimes the initial speed of a piece is indicated by a metronome marking. When this is the case, the tempo must not be followed rigidly but must be subject to variation with the mood of the words.
A metronome is a spring-driven pendulum upon which slides a movable weight. The higher the weight stands upon the pendulum, the slower the instrument ticks; the lower the weight, the faster the tick. To find a given tempo by means of the metronome, set the weight on the mark that corresponds to the given number, then beat the given note at the speed of the tick. For example, if the marking is ? = 100, set the weight at 100 and beat a quarter-note to each tick. Having established the tempo thoroughly in mind, turn off the metronome. Practicing with a metronome is likely to make a conductor's rhythm too uncompromisingly rigid.

PAUL THE TEACHER.�Paul was a great teacher. He must be ranked as one of the greatest of all time. The large number of church branches established by him is strong evidence of his ability to convert others to Christianity. A man to be an outstanding teacher must certainly, among other requirements, be thoroughly converted to those principles and ideals he is teaching. Paul had a passionate love for Christ that made it easy for him to fulfill that requirement. "He is willing to be thought beside himself (II Cor. 5:13) if so be he succeeds in his ambition to please Jesus." (Robertson) The crucified Christ was the central theme of his teaching. Professor H. E. Dana says, "He decided the mode of presentation in view of the audience (Acts 17:22), but allowed no consideration of adaptation to alter the theme. Such was Paul's policy."
Certain scholars have attempted to show that there existed a great difference between the religion or preaching of Christ and that of Paul. It is in fact common at the present time to speak of Pauline Christianity in contrast to that of Christ. In the light of modern revelation, Paul's teachings are in accord with those of Christ. Apparent differences are for the most part easily explained. How substantially Paul's doctrines concur with those taught by Christ can be tested by perusing the Ready References under the various headings and comparing the references in the gospels with those in Paul's letters and the appropriate chapters in the Acts. Some of the teachings in the gospels may be more explicit and clear in certain instances than as given by Paul and vice versa. That is to be expected. We haven't by any means all of the teachings of either Christ or Paul.
THE BEGINNING OF THE END.�On Paul's Third Missionary Journey he realized that the battle with the Judaizers was not yet over despite the concessions he and Barnabas had received in the Jerusalem Conference. He therefore determined to go to Jerusalem for the day of Pentecost. (Acts 20:16) Jerusalem was the center in which the Judaizers had intrenched themselves. The Church Authorities were not on their side, but the old Mosaic tradition was a hard one to break for many members of the Church. Paul realized that freedom for the Gentile Christians was absolutely necessary if the cause of Christianity was to succeed in the west. He determined to do for the Gentiles what he could if it cost him his life. Acts 20 sounds a somber note, and we know that Paul senses the beginning of the end. "And now," says he, "behold, I am going bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there: Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me. But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God." (Acts 20:22-24) This reminds us strongly of Joseph Smith's last words when he took leave of the Saints and went on the journey from which he was destined never to return alive: "I am going like a lamb to the slaughter; but I am calm as a summer's morning; I have a conscience void of offense towards God, and towards all men. I shall die innocent, and it shall yet be said of me�he was murdered in cold blood."
Paul's ship finally reaches Tyre where the cargo was to be unloaded. Luke records the following: "And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem." (Acts 21:4) Finally, Paul and his party set sail again and landed at Caesarea. And here, once more, Paul is warned. "And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judea a certain prophet, named Agabus. And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles. And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem." (Acts 21:10-12) But go Paul does and recounts to James and the other elders of the church his wonderful success in the ministry among the Gentiles. The brethren are delighted, but proceed to gently caution him concerning the Jewish Christians who still believe in the law of Moses. "Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law: And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs. What is it therefore? The multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come. Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them; them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law." (Acts 21:20-24)
The above quotation is exceedingly important, because it clearly explains the incidents that indirectly brought about Paul's death. At the Jerusalem Conference Paul won for the Gentile Christians freedom from Mosaic regulations. No issue was raised concerning Jewish Christians. But the Judaizers, "zealots for the law," probably spread the propaganda against Paul mentioned in the quotation above. Their charges, by the irony of fate, were almost identical with those that caused the death of Stephen. Paul kept the advice of his brethren and the next day entered the temple to purify himself with four other men. Jews from Asia spied him and "stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him, Crying out, Men of Israel help: This is the man that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place; and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place." (Acts 21:27, 28) Such a great commotion was created by the people that it came to the notice of the Roman soldiers who placed Paul under arrest, thus saving him from a further beating at the hands of the enraged Jews. Paul's subsequent pleas before the mob, the Sanhedrin, Felix, Festus, and Agrippa (Acts 21-26) were masterful, but without effect. Finally, he was forced to appeal his case to Caesar when Festus proposed that he should go up to Jerusalem to be tried "concerning these things". The great apostle knew that Festus would find some pretext to turn him over to the Sanhedrin, as Pilate did the Christ, if the case should be tried in the city of David. His answer to Festus is one of the classical utterances of all time. "I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest. For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me up unto them. I appeal unto Caesar." (Acts 25:10, 11) Relieved at the prospect of getting rid of such a troublesome prisoner after two years, Festus consulted with his council and answered, "Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? Unto Caesar shalt thou go." (Acts 25:12)
Luke's description of the trip to Rome, with Paul and other prisoners, is a masterly one. When the party reached the "Eternal City" Paul was enabled to preach the gospel under nominal restraint. Luke ends his account in a manner that breathes perfectly the spirit of the Apostle to the Gentiles. "And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him, Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him." (Acts 28:30, 31)
PAUL THE MARTYR.�Many scholars believe that when Paul was tried before Nero he was released. If their theory is correct, the apostle probably went east to visit branches of the Church wherein he had once labored. Then, according to tradition, he went to Spain; a late tradition even asserts he went on to Britain. Those who hold to the above theory say that eventually Paul was arrested again, brought before Nero and condemned to be beheaded by the sword. The execution probably took place by the Ostian Road. Tradition again has it that a Roman "matron named Lucina buried the body of St. Paul on her own land, beside the Ostian Road".
Paul was ready to meet his beloved Master. How appropriate are the words in his second letter to Timothy (4:7, 8): "I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing."
Questions and Problems
1. Can you come to a satisfactory decision as to when Paul became an apostle by consulting the Book of Acts and the Epistles? Do you think Paul became a member of the Twelve of his day? Could he have been ordained an apostle without being a member of the Twelve?
2. Analyze Paul's address before Agrippa. (Acts 26:1-32) What is your opinion of its quality?
3. Briefly describe Paul's journey to Rome and what befell him on the way. (Acts 27, 28)
4. Compare the circumstances under which Paul and the Prophet Joseph Smith met their respective deaths.

MESSAGES TO THE HOME No. 7 Kindness
"And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you."�Eph. 4:32.
THE New Testament is replete with examples of the kindness of Jesus in dealing with people. His heart was full of compassion for the people of Jerusalem. He wept for them, although they persecuted Him. In His kindness He said, "Suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not." He released the woman who was about to be stoned and caused her accusers to flee. He dealt gently with the woman of Samaria, with the sick, the blind, the leper, the ignorant, and with the learned and even the unthankful and evildoers.
Life is much more joyful and satisfying to one who is compassionate, forbearing, tender, lenient, gentle, mild, forgiving and appreciative. Kindness is an essential qualification in successful parentage. Kindness is shown by one's consideration for another in times of sickness or distress or whenever help is needed. In childhood we learned that kindness is "to do or say the kindest things in the kindest way," and that "Little deeds of kindness, Little words of love Make this earth an Eden Like the heaven above." A beautiful woman eighty-three years old was asked why it was that one never noticed her wrinkles but always saw her smile. "If that is true," she said, "it must be because I have tried to do something kind each day."
What about the letter we were to write, the loving word to be said, the visit to be made, the call on the telephone, the little delicacies to be shared, ere the sun goes down? Pity is a form of kindliness so
beautifully explained by the poet Whittier: "O Brother man! Fold to thy heart thy brother; When pity dwells, the peace of God is there, To worship rightly is to love each other, Each smile a hymn, each kindly deed a prayer. Follow with reverent steps the great example, Of Him whose holy work was 'doing ood', So shall the wide earth seem our father's temple Each loving life a psalm of gratitude." Discussion 1. Relate some incident of kindness shown you within the last week. 2. Quote one of our songs on kindness. 3. How did the ten lepers repay the kindness of Jesus?�Luke 17:11- 19. A of tterature THE ADVANCE OF THE NOVEL Lesson 7 "The Bent Twig" - is very appropriate that Relief Society should choose as the concluding novel for this year's study a work from the pen of one of America's ablest and best beloved women; a story with a very definite purpose, a vital message, vivid and intense from start to finish. In his book The Women Who Make Our Novels, Grant Overton says: "Mrs. Fisher is, we think, the only novelist of whose work we shall say nothing. Why? Because it 'speaks for itself'? Certainly not. | Every one's work does that. No, because it does not speak sufficiently for her. You are asked here and now to think of her not as a novelist, but as a woman. For as a novelist we could say of her only the obvious fact, that she is a topnotcher judged by any and every standard.... What she does need, or rather, what 'her readers and all readers need, is a reminder of her role as teacher, helper, friend. She is one of those fine people whose 58 - JANUARY, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE work makes the plain word 'service' a shining and symbolic thing." Though born in Kansas during the time her father was president of the university of that state, anyone who reads Dorothy Canfield Fisher's books knows that she is American, of New England descent. She has as firmly fixed Arlington, Vermont in our literature as has Louisa May Alcott, Concord, Massachusetts. The first of the Canfield family came to America in 1636 and a little over a century later settled on land in Vermont, which is still in the family possession. Mrs. Fisher tells some delightful stories of her liberal thinking, strong-minded ancestors, women as well as men, and of the part they played in colonial days. Her father, James Hulme Canfield, was an educator of high rank and president of two or three midwestern universities before joining the faculty of Columbia University, New York. Dorothy's education was cosmopolitan but always at rock bottom American, a liberal, tolerant American, devoid of prejudice or bigotry. Her experience in co-educational university towns profoundly influenced the young woman and afforded material for some of the most realistic chapters in her books. This is especially true of The Bent Twig. She lived in the old family home in Vermont, and in France, Italy, England and the Scandinavian countries. Her girlhood contacts and friendships ranged as widely, and her books are ordered from all over the world. Her first ambition seems to have been that of a teacher. She studied for her doctor's degree in romance languages at the Sorbonne, Paris, and at Columbia, New York. In collaboration with one of her professors at Columbia, she wrote some texts on English. In 1907, she married John R. Fisher and went to live on one of the farms at Arlington, Vermont, where her home became the center of all that concerns the welfare and development of the community. From this time, she seems to have been less actively concerned with an academic career and turned rather to the field of creative writing and social problems. Squirrel Cage was her first real novel. She has, however, always been vitally interested in the problems of education for young and old. Her Why Stop Learning? Remains one of the very finest surveys of the Adult Education Movement that has ever been written, and social guidance experts regard Mrs. Fisher as one of the ablest in this field. While in Italy, she became personally acquainted with Dr. Maria Montessori, the founder of a system of primary education which differs from the kindergarten method mainly in that it aims at the individual development rather than the collective plan of teaching. The teacher is a director rather than an instructor, and the aim is to observe and guide rather than to teach. This method endeavors to give the child an environment that will liberate the personality and tries through sense education to stimulate the intellect itself. It is claimed that while there is no formal instruction the children learn to read and write with surprising rapidity under this system. Mrs. Fisher became very much interested in this, and at Dr. Montessori's request undertook to explain the system and theories. The result was her book A Montessori Mother. This was followed by Mothers and Children, a classic in the field of child guidance; Hillsboro People, a collection of stories. Of her own neighbors; Understood Betsey, one of the finest and most popular books for children that literature offers. Soon after the beginning of the World War, Mrs. Fisher went to France to join her husband who was already in the Ambulance Corps. Her war work won recognition from the Government for distinguished service. She was particularly active in efforts to help the widows and orphans and the men who had lost their sight in battles. Some of the institutions she started have been perpetuated and are now maintained by the French Government. In 1919, completely exhausted by the strenuous labors in war-torn Europe, the family, consisting of Mr. And Mrs. Fisher, their daughter Sally and little son Richard, returned to their home in Arlington. The Harcourt Brace News has this to say of Dorothy Canfield Fisher: "A liberal American from Vermont. She is the author of some of the best loved novels of the century.... Her career as a novelist has had few parallels both for critical and popular acclaim, and many of her powers derive from the fact that she is not specifically or consciously a 'career' woman but a successful wife, mother, now grandmother, and a plain friendly citizen, joining her fellow citizens in her own Vermont community in the steady day-by-day struggle at first hand with the knotty problems of communal living. These are the experiences she draws upon for her books. She is a real scholar, holding eight degrees from American universities, but no academic interest is as great as that humanitarian RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE, JANUARY - 59 one of making education mean something to young and old. Her understanding of young people shows in every novel she has written, and she has created some of the most endearing and real children in our literature. Her understanding of old people is to be expected of a Vermonter." Mrs. Fisher holds her Ph. D. In romance languages and was the first woman to be on the Board of Education in Vermont. "lee as the twig is bent, the tree is inclined." All of Mrs. Fisher's work is concerned with the intimate problems of every-day life, usually with the actions and reactions on each other of men, women and children in the ordinaty family relations. This is strikingly true of The Bent Twig, a story whose charm lies in the distinction given to the portrayal of familar phases of life. The "Twig" of the title is the daughter of a mid-western university professor. She is "bent" by the standards, traditions, inheritances and ideals of plaintiving, high-thinking parents who provide a healthy, wholesome, happy, natural American family life for their children. The novel is divided into four books, and the titles to the chapters are very significant. Chapter I, "Sylvia's Home," presents the brilliant, fun-loving father, the sensible, fine, intelligent mother, who, in the words of the reviewer "bent the twig in the direction which the tree of Sylvia Marshall's gallant womanhood was to grow". We also meet little sister Judith, baby brother Lawrence, and a glimpse of Aunt Victoria is presented. This beautiful picture of home life may well be taken from Mrs. Fisher's own 60 - JANUARY, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE personal experiences on her farm home in Vermont. "The Marshall's Friends" gives a most enlightening account of the people who played a part in the environment of Sylvia's childhood. Prominent among these was "Old Reinhardt" whose real musical training influenced her all her life. If one is judged. By his friends, Professor and Mrs. Marshall were unusual people, and the influences were early at work in the lives of the children. _ Mrs. Fisher's fine sense of humor is in evidence in "Every One's Opinion of Every One Else". In "Brother and Sister" the two forces which played the most important part in Sylvia's development are clearly suggested. In Chapter VII, "We Hold These Truths to be Self Evident', the account of the public school is one of the most graphic in the entire book. E. E. Hale in The Dial says: "The account of the democracy of the common schools would teach more concerning that interesting topic than many text books." The following excerpt is a good example of the author's skill in depicting one of our existing social institutions: "What she really learned was, as with her mates, another matter, for of course those devouringly active little minds did not spend six hours a day without learning something incessantly. The few rags and tatters of book information they acquired were but the merest fringes on the great garment of learning acquired by these public school children which was to wrap them about all their lives. What they learned during those eight years of sitting still and not whispering had nothing to do with the books in their desks or the lore in their teachers' brains. The great impression stamped upon the wax of their minds, which be- � came iron in after years, was democracy, a crude, distorted, wavering image of democracy, like every image an ideal in this imperfect world; but in its essence a reflection of the ideal of their country. No European could have conceived how literally it was true that birth or wealth or social position of a child made no difference in the estimation of his mates. There were no exceptions to the custom of considering the individual on his own merits. These merits were often queerly enough imagined, a faculty for standing on his head redounding as much or more to a boy's credit as the utmost brilliance in recitation, or generosity of temperament, but at least he was valued for something he himself could do, and not for any fortuitous incidents of birth and fortune." The story of the two little Fingal girls is one of the most tragic in the book, and it is a most dramatic presentation of one of the great problems facing our nation today. The reactions of Sylvia and Judith, the conduct of the children, the school officials and the parents, afford rare material for a discussion on child guidance, as well as placing The Bent Twig in the class of best realistic and psychological novels. The delicate treatment of Arnold as well as of Judith and Sylvia are living portraits of real children. In one of the reviews of Mrs. Fisher's life it is said: "Her interest in growth explains the profound seriousness with which she treats children and their problems. In some of her books she deals almost exclusively with children and their struggles forward into life." In The Home Maker she asks: "What is home making? Good housekeeping or a capacity to understand children and their needs?" In The Bent Twig, as in other books, she shows how truly children feel the undercurrents in their homes and how intense for them are their daily problems and how significant for development in adult life.

CHANCE AND IGNORANCE FAVOR _ SUPERSTITIONS. If our knowledge of the physical world and the world of people were complete, there would be little room for superstition. If we had a complete knowledge of how to predict the weather, we would not follow signs; such as, "A rainbow at night, a sailor's delight; a rainbow in the morning, sailor's good warning" or "Plant potatoes in the dark of the moon". As people become more advanced in their knowledge, they rely less on uncritical ways of predicting future events. Today, we look into the morning paper and predict the weather from scientific reports more accurately than by any of the ancient signs. But even with the help of science, we are still unable to predict future events with perfect accuracy. There are elements of chance or accident which almost daily cross our path, many of which by a change in events could alter our lives materially. In a split second of carelessness, an automobile is overturned, and we are crippled for life. A chance meeting of a person may, likewise, lead to a friendship which ripens into love and marriage, and all of our personal history is thereby changed. There is probably no such thing as pure chance in our world: We say things happen by chance when we do not know the laws that account for them. So, superstitions themselves are simply ways, although feeble ones, of trying to understand and explain what seems to happen by chance. Superstitions and primitive beliefs are different from scientific explanations in that they are based on less valid facts than science is, and in that feelings of fear and hope are more prominent in superstitions than in science. 62 - JANUARY, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE IT. HOW WISHES AND FEELINGS AFFECT OUR THOUGHTS. Modern psychologists, thanks to Freud and the psy- ' choanalysts, have come to realize that pure reasoning or logic has relatively little to do with directing the lives of most people. There are always personal wishes, feelings of expectation or apprehension, which give color and direction to our thinking. For example, a mother can hardly see her own child's faults without discounting them. But we find fault with our enemy, and most. Of us can no more speak appreciatively of his virtues than we can change our characters in a day. Recently, a psychologist (Ruch) performed an interesting experiment in which he gave a great number of illogical arguments to a large group of students and asked them to pick out which one was correct. He found that far more often than would be expected by chance alone, the students picked as correct the statement which fitted best their particular prejudices or personal feelings. We see again how feeling overshadows logic. Likewise, in observing or reporting an incident, as an automobile accident, we see more things in our favor than in favor of the other party. When we attempt to recall the details later, our memories play the same trick on us, and we change the details and forget the ones unfavorable to us. We do this often with no intent to falsify. I. WE NEGLECT THE CASES WHICH DO NOT PROVE OUR THEORIES. Now that we have shown that feelings and wishes, suggestibility, and lack of knowledge tend to make us superstitious, we shall proceed to mention a common mental process by which we confirm or prove our superstitions or false judgments. A lover sees only that which is lovely about his loved one. A fraction of an inch "more or less" on her nose is not noticed. When the romance wears off, he begins to see such defects. If we believe black cats bring bad luek, we start out with an attitude of acceptance, perhaps acquired from some other believer. Then we proceed to look for cases to prove out belief. When a black cat crosses our way, we "get set" for some bad luck; truly enough in the course of any ordinary few days some reverse will usually come. If it doesn't come, we keep looking until it does, or else we forget the whole incident. Nor are we particular as to whether the proof must be a large or a small misfortune. We do not look for the good turns that may follow, because that isn't what we believe in. We also forget all of the cases where nothing noticeable happens. As another example, consider the superstition that "Friday the 13th" brings bad luck. We stretch every point to see the bad luck and fail to see any of the good, if we believe in this superstition. Should nothing happen, we forget that and hold to our belief nevertheless. This is called "neglect of the negative instances". It operates in all of the common superstitions which play a part in the daily life of average peole. Moreover, in our conversation with others who believe as we do, we accept all of the cases they tell us which confirm our belief, and we lend a deaf ear to people who try to cast doubt. The observations of others are themselves often distorted in the telling by the "will to believe" �and the "will to make a good story". Also in our minds, as we have seen, we not only fail to see events accurately in the first place, but we remember them wishfully, that is, as we would like them to have been. Unfortunately, all faulty thinking is done without realizing how faulty it is. We do it with a good conscience, not deliberately intending to deceive ourselves or others. Charles Darwin, who contributed much to present-day knowledge of life, worked for years gathering facts to support his theories before he would publish them. He wrote that in his studies he found that to write down every case that disproved his theory was especially important because the contrary facts were the most easily forgotten. This is the method of science: It truly doesn't care where the facts lead. IV. SOME EXAMPLES OF FAULTY GUIDES. 1. Astrology is the reading of character by a system of interpreting the stars. How stars millions of miles away could have an influence over the lives of certain people of the millions on earth is unfathomable. But that makes no difference to believers. Astrology is not a question of logic, reason, or fact, but a question of gratifying uncritical wishes and feelings about one's future. Today our newspapers carry scientific observations on the weather, news reports flashed from all quarters of the earth in an instant; along with these fruits of scientific research are the horoscopes and other fortune RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE, JANUARY - 63 telling "rackets" which appeal to the ignorance and emotions of the people. The radio has also come as a great development of science, but it, too, is exploited by fortune tellers. But, some people object, these systems do turn out to be correct� and they do seem to. Let us remember, however, that the "wish is mother of the thought', and our judgment is warped by a strong desite that the predictions will come true. The same may be said of reading fortunes from tea leaves, palmistry, and fortune-telling card games. Even to intelligent people, these activities may be enjoyable pastimes, because for the moment they let our hopes run free in imagination; but when we take these predictions seriously and guide our lives by them, we are like the blind who are led by the blind. We are then following the kind of superstitions which guided uncivilized people; in a day of science we should know better. (See reference No. 2.) 2. Telepathy means the transferring of thoughts from one person to another without the use of the ordinary sense organs (eyes, ears, etc.). There have been flurries of enthusiasm for telepathy even in scientific circles for many years, but a careful study of the evidence fails to convince us that telepathy is a fact. Wishful thinking, neglect of negative instances, and failure to observe rigid conditions for observing and recording results will account for most of the claims of the advocates of telepathy. 3. Phrenology is the doctrine that claims to judge character by. The shape of the head, and physiognomy claims to judge character by the ap- 64 - JANUARY, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE pearance of the face. As late as 1911 there was a journal of phrenology published in United States, and even today many circus side-shows have a phrenology or physiognomy booth where people pay high prices to hear glowing terms about their personalities and future possibilities, all of which is usually pleasing because so flattering. Both phrenology and physiognomy have been completely exploded by modern science. Three main objections are raised to phrenology: (1) The shape of the skull does not correspond to the shape of the brain, (2) there are no such faculties as "virtue", "knowledge", "honesty", and "will" as independent and single functions which could be localized in particular parts of the brain, and (3) if there were such definite faculties, experiments have shown that the brain functions more or less as a whole, and special brain locations for various functions is confined only roughly to such functions as the use of certain limbs and to the receiving of certain sensations. As to the disproof of physiognomy, many experiments have shown that we can judge almost nothing about a person from his photograph. Clinical psychologists, who among other things give mental tests to diagnose fieeble-mindedness, are constantly deceived by a feeble-minded child who may look normal, or a normal child who looks stupid. If looks were a safe guide, we wouldn't need psychologists and psychiatrists. 4. Dream interpretation fascinates many folks and has considerable influence over their lives. Psychoanalysts have made an ambitious attempt to read great significance into our dreams. With the problem of dreams, science cannot carry on very convincing experiments; but the safe course to follow from our present knowledge is perhaps to think of dreams as reflecting our mental background, as through a "distorted mirror". Dreams are usually fleeting, uncontrolled streams of ideas and images. The course of dreams is directed by our deeper wishes and apprehensions and sometimes by body sensations while _ sleeping. Many of our dreams are means of satisfying in an imaginary world our frustrated wishes of wakeful life. Dreams, by being worked over after we awaken, are often given meaning they didn't originally have. Much of the "sense" we seem to find in dreams is a result of this wakeful reconstruction. The majority of our dreams, however, have no definite significance and need not concern us. This does not imply that dreams may not be used on special occasion as a channel for inspirational guidance when the occasion justifies it, but inspiration for most of us is more likely to come as good insight during our waking life, quickened judgment in. Dealing with everyday realities, and the glowing within us of noble purposes. As Jastrow says, "If reasonably at peace, we need not fear, nor unduly consider our dreams nor our uncensored associations. Life is not a dream but a reality; it proceeds by thinking. Yet each personality harbors a dreaming self. We guide our lives wisely when our efforts make our noblest dreams come true." (Piloting Your Life, pp. 251, 252.) We should point out again that belief in dreams as guides to our lives is subject to the same errors of thinking as those discussed in con- nection with other questionable guides. (For further discussion of dreams, see reference No. 3, pp. 647- 652.) V. A FEW SAFER GUIDES. Judgment of character and prediction of what a person is likely to do in the future is one of our most fascinating problems of daily life. Almost everyone has some system of making judgments about people and their future. Many have some kernel of truth; most of them are nothing but pure guesses, with the usual errors of judgment confirming our belief in them. Psychologists are greatly concerned with these problems, and much valuable research is being done today in the field of testing and analyzing personality. On the basis of this analysis, a person's probable future course is predicted. But still we cannot predict with very great accuracy. Science does not claim to predict with perfect accuracy what people are likely to do, but the unscientific systems always deny their own inaccuracies and errors. The more "cock-sure" the advocates of a system are, the more unreliable their system is likely to be. Tests and measurements of what people actually do are among the better ways of judging what they are likely to do in the future. What a person will do depends upon many unpredictable events within the person and within his environment. Hence, perfect prediction is not possible; with present-day tests, however, we are able to predict a person's future prospects or limitations with at least as much accuracy as the weather man predicts the weather. The tests are probably more accurate RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE, JANUARY - 65 than the doctor's predictions on how long we will live. The results of tests and measurements are made still more meaningful by putting them along with the results of a thorough individual study of an individual's personality, not so much by tests as by careful diagnosis similar to a doctor's diagnosis of our physical health. Biographies of great persons, if written with good insight, give us portraits of a life and enlighten us much on the workings of a person's character. Studious reading of biography is one of the better ways to reach a sound judgment by which to better predict and direct our future. Biography is valuable in giving us patterns and aims for our living. Judgment in interpreting our own lives and the lives of others is developed also by studying other people in our daily contacts. Good judgment is developed if we study others without bias and preconceived notions and with a genuine desire to know the actual truth about human behavior. The guidance of good Church and civic leaders is greatly to be preferred over fortune tellers and soothsayers, because responsible leaders become leaders partly because of their understanding of people. Broad education is necessary to fortify ourselves against uncritically accepting the many unscientific and misleading systems current today for judging people and attempting to predict their future. Broad education and "old wives tales", superstitions, and other false guides cannot well survive in the same mind. Wise living requires facts as well as wishes. In the long run, hopes and desires are seldom served by the false 66 - JANUARY, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE guides that appeal only to our ignorance and which are therefore almost certain to be "blind guides leading the blind, and both falling into the ditch". (A discussion of the tests by which to distinguish between a false belief and genuine faith is reserved for the next lesson. ) Problems For Discussion 1.

Shouted eight-year-old Bobby, as he bounded through the front door of the Prentice home, scattering bits of dry leaves that had clung to his shoes as he ran cross-lots home from school; as he ran through the livingroom, he left footprints of dust behind him. "Bobby Prentice," came the stern, cold voice of his mother, "How many times have I told you not to come in through the front door? Now look at that carpet just after I have finished vacuuming it. I spend nine-tenths of my time cleaning up after one or the other members of this family; I work like a slave to keep this house clean, and no one seems to appreciate it." "I'm sorry, Mom, I forgot, honest I did. But Pll get the vacuum and clean the carpet so that it looks as good as new", said Bobby. "You had no business to forget after all the times I have told you, and you know very well you can't get the vacuum out of the closet; I'll have to do it myself, tired as I am. Now you go right out of here and clean your shoes and come in through the back door as you should", replied his mother. A few minutes later, a different Bobby came into the house through the back door, the glow of enthusiasm had left his face, and the tone of his voice had lost its cheerfulness. "Mom, I was going to tell you that I was elected president of my class in school this afternoon." "A fine president you will make when you can't even remember to do what you are told to do around home," said Mrs. Prentice, as she diligently continued to run the vacuum over an already spotless carpet. With his self-esteem shattered, Bobby left the house with his mother's words ringing in his ears. That night he fell asleep, his cheeks wet with tears; he had decided definitely to tell his teacher in the morning that he could not be president of his class, because he knew he could never remember what a president should do. Mrs. Prentice is a typical example of a vast throng of mothers who abide by the attitude that people are made for houses rather than that houses are made for people. Every day for a week Henry Stone had experienced a series of unusual difficulties in the milk plant for which he was manager. While driying home after work on Saturday, his mind was filled with the thought of the happy evening he would have at home with his wife Edith and their little son. Henry had been at home only a short time when he thought that Edith was not acting quite herself; before long, he was convinced beyond a doubt that something was wrong and wondered RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE, JANUARY - 67 why Edith did not tell him what the trouble was. Finally, he asked if she were ill. Immediately, his wife burst into tears and began accusing her husband of not loving her as much as he once did. After Edith had given vent to her feelings through the medium of tears and unkind remarks concerning Henry's actions of late, she reminded him that this day was their fourth wedding anniversary, and he had forgotten to even mention it. Henry tried in vain to convince Edith that his forgetfulness was due to business worries and not because his love for her was less, but she would not be consoled. Monday morning, the new chair they had both wanted for a long time arrived at the Stone home and attached to it was a note from Henry expressing the hope that he had been forgiven. Some ten months after this incident, Henry confided to a friend that Edith had never missed an opportunity to tell someone, in his presence, about how he had forgotten their wedding anniversary. For days and days Betty and George Craig, who were ten and twelve years old respectively, had been waiting the arrival of their father's birthday. It had been agreed that the family would celebrate the event by having dinner at home after which they would all go to the seveno'clock movie. At last the hour of the birthday dinner had arrived, and a happy family group it was that sat down to enjoy a perfectly prepared meal. But the happiness was short lived, to be replaced by sorrow and disappointment, all because in the excitement of having Father make his wish and blow out all of the candles on his birthday cake in one 68 - JANUARY, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE blow to insure the fulfillment of his wish, Betty tipped over her glass filled with punch. From that moment the most important feature of the evening, as far as Mrs. Craig was concerned, was the spot on the tablecloth. Betty was reminded by her mother again and again that she had ruined her father's birthday dinner because of her carelessness and clumsiness. In spite of protests from husband and son, Mrs. Craig insisted on taking time immediately after dinner to wash her tablecloth. The result was that the family arrived at the theater some fifteen minutes after the feature had begun. This annoyed Mr. Craig who was already upset because of watching Betty's tearful eyes, and thoughtlessly he reminded the family that he would rather remain at home than not be present at the beginning of the picture. Mrs. Craig declared that it was not her fault; as it was, she was almost a nervous wreck for having to hurry so fast. Betty felt as guilty as a real criminal and continued to wonder in what way she was to blame, since she did not even know how it all happened. George was puzzled as to why something always had to happen to spoil every family party they had ever planned. Just a spot on the tablecloth, but considered important enough to spoil a precious slice of life for an entire family! And now the case of sixty-year old Mrs. Brent who still swells with pride when she reiterates to her friends that the one thing that she has always insisted upon since the day of her marriage is that her husband be home for dinner at twelve o'clock noon, because that was the time they had set for dinner. She thought that after a wife had spent time preparing a meal the least a husband could do was to be home on time. Now the greatest disappointment in Mrs. Brent's life is that her only son, Alfred, who is forty years old, has never married, and she cannot understand why. Alfred tells his friends that he decided when he was in his teens that he would never marry because of the disagreeable nagging and quarteling that went on between his father and mother every time his father was late for dinner. As a lad, he appreciated his father's position in the matter and was in sympathy with him; because of this, he promised himself he would never marry when he grew up, and thus avoid trouble for himself such as his father had experienced. Wat a history of unhappiness we would possess if we but had the record of all the cases of family friction caused as a result of undue importance being given to relatively unimportant things; such as, leaving the hall door open, not placing the used towel neatly folded with edges even on the towel-rack in the bathroom, husband or wife saying the wrong thing at the wrong time at Mrs. UpandUp's party, wife interrupting husband just when he was about to tell the point of an oft-repeated story, wife dancing twice with an old beau, husband paying friend Marge too many compliments, Junior disgracing the family by violating some rule of table etiquette when guests were present, Susan getting her face and hands dirty just as Mother wanted to place her on display before visitors, even mistakes or misjudgments in the purchase of Christmas gifts. The above list is a sample of the many things that have been reported as having caused friction and unhappiness in some family. How important a thing or an experience is in the life of a person is decided by the person's standard of values. In general, these standards can be criticised on two points: First, we place too great an emphasis on material things and overlook important spiritual things; second, we tend to consider our standard of values as something static rather than as something plastic, in process of development, to be modified as situations in life may demand. Every period of life changes; therefore, our values must change. Wise, indeed, was the mother of three small children who decided that at least while her children were smal] it was not important to have her house cluttered up with unnecessary bric-a-brac placed within reach of tiny hands and which constantly served to stimulate childish curiosity and the desire to handle even the most delicate work of art. Against the protests of her mother, who was responsible for providing most of the ornaments, she made her house livable for children as well as adults by relegating all such things to the top shelf of a cupboard until the little ones were older. When friction arises as a result of unimportant issues that seem important, one should try to determine whether or not there are undercurrents of discontent and maladjustment within the family that are the real cause and whether the minor issues are not serving merely as the flame that sets off the explosion. If this is the case, the undercurrents must be brought to the surface and RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE, JANUARY - 69 faced frankly and honestly and the minor issues recognized as such. As an aid in determining the importance that should be allotted to various things and experiences, we might apply the following questions: To whom is it important? Is the factor of importance determined by selfish motives; such as, pride, the desire to dominate, desire to gain status, etc.? Is there likely to be a repetition of the experience? Will the experience damage the personalities involved or will it soon be forgotten with little or no damage to anyone if importance is not attached to it? Providing no importance is attached to it today, will it seem unimportant tomorrow? Is human life or human happiness involved? In conclusion, we suggest that laughter be substituted for tears whenever it is possible. Remember that nothing is so bad but that it might have been worse; we do not mean to adopt a Pollyanna attitude but just use common sense. Maintain a sense of humor. Never allow a day to go by without enjoying at least one hearty laugh; the more often the family can laugh together the better it is for family living. "There is certainly no defense against adverse fortune which is, on the whole, so effectual as an habitual sense of humor", says T. W. Higginson. One of the greatest values that comes as a result of active participation in the class discussions in our various auxiliary organizations of the Latter-day Saint Church is that it assists each person to gain a more nearly correct and better balanced sense of what is important and what is unimportant. Our own sense of values is influenced greatly by what 70 - JANUARY, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE others consider valuable; therefore, it is wise to meet together and express our values both in words and actions. By comparison we develop the power to evaluate. The possession of the power to wisely judge values fortifies one against a goodly share of the would-be worries and calamities that threaten successful family living. Questions and Problems for Discussion 1. Make as long a list as you can of issues which you consider unimportant that have caused family friction. Compare lists in class and note issues upon which there is disagreement of values. 2. Give a solution to the problems involved in each of the cases cited above. How do you think you would react in similar situations? 3. Can you give examples of family life in which the friction that seemed to be the result of minor issues is in reality due to undercurrents of discontent? How would you handle such a case? Nission Lessons L. D. S. CHURCH HISTORY Lesson 7 Early Growth of the Church (To be used in place of Literary lesson.) STRANGE as it may seem, those six young men sitting around that kitchen table in the Whitmer home, all felt that they were starting a world movement. It was not something for Fayette and Manchester and Palmyra, nor even for New York or the United States, but for Canada, South America, England, Germany, France, the Scandinavian countries, and the whole world. But how was the new religion to go from that little town to other nations than the United States? It might have been hard for those six men to think up a satisfactory way. But it was God's work, and he would provide the means. And he did. For one thing, there was to be no men set apart for the ministry by reason of their schooling. Schools were all well enough in their place, but they could not give priesthood or the Holy Ghost, no matter how good they were, and priesthood and the Holy Ghost were the important, the essential necessities in the Church of Christ. And then, for another thing, every man, not a few men only, should have the priesthood in one of its degrees, and every member should enjoy the Holy Ghost to guide him into all truth. And so the Lord made it obligatory on every man "who was warned to warn his neighbor." In this way the new gospel should be carried into every nation on the face of the earth. {Osea SMITH, of course, was the very first one to know about the Restoration. He was the Prophet of the New Dispensation. After his First Vision he told his family about it, and they probably told others. The same thing was true in the case of the visions concerning Moroni. Gradually such men as Martin Harris, Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Joseph Knight came to know about the mission of the young prophet and his work. Then"the Book of Mormon was published and the Church organized. After that things moved very fast. It seems that Samuel Smith, Joseph's younger brother, was the first one to go out to seek converts to the new religion. Putting a few copies of the Nephite Record into a knapsack, he went out into the country around Palmyra. He intended to sell the book where he could and also to tell people about how it came into existence. Meanwhile, others talked to their friends and acquaintances about the New Movement in religion. Years before this Joseph had worked for Joseph Knight, who lived in Colesville, in another county from that in which the young prophet lived. Joseph Knight was a well-to-do farmer and mill owner in that township. So the Prophet and Oliver went to that place and began to preach to Knight's neighbors. In time they converted and baptized these neighbors as well as the Knight family. All told, there were about sixty of these. Meantime, in Manchester and Palmyra and Fayette, there were others who wished to know about the New Movement. People by the name of Rockwell, Grover, Jolley, Peterson, Page, and others, joined RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE, JANUARY - 71 the Church after looking into it. These, with the Whitmers, the Smiths, and Harris, made a good beginning. Most of these were farmers, some of them very well-to-do, like Knight, Harris, and Grover. There were still others who, we may say, heard about the new gospel by accident. One of these, for instance, was a man by the name of Parley P. Pratt. Born in New York in a very old American family, he had gone to Ohio, to take up some land and to farm that land. But he had become converted to the Campbellite Church, and wished to preach it. So he decided to go to New York to learn how to preach. On his way there, however, he fell in with some Latter-day Saints, who gave him a copy of the Book of Mormon and talked to him about the visions and revelations of Joseph Smith. He believed, was baptized, was ordained an elder, and went on his way to New York, and there converted his brother Orson Pratt. Orson Pratt, who was then only nineteen years old, called on the Prophet at Fayette; then, after his ordination to the priesthood, he went on a mission through six states, always on foot, and baptized more than one hundred persons. On this mission he walked four thousand miles. N the autumn the first real mission in the Church took place. It was a mission to the American Indians, on the Reservation west of the Missouri River. It included Oliver Cowdery, Parley P. Pratt, Peter Whitmer, Jr., and Ziba Peterson. These men were called by revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith. From Fayette, in New York, to 72 - JANUARY, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE Independence, in Missouri, is about one thousand miles as an airplane might have gone. But this missionary group, as you may guess, did not go in a direct line. And so the route they took was nearer twelve or thirteen hundred miles than one thousand. In order to reach their. Destination they passed through the States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri. They expected, as you know, to go across the border, to preach to the Indians. If you consult the map of the United States, which was published in the July Magazine, you will get a better idea of the journey, especially its length. In 1831 Missouri was the extreme western limit of the United States. Beyond that, for hundreds of miles, was the wilderness�trackless plains, high mountains, deserts, and great forests, inhabited by wild animals and wilder Indians. There was a special reason, as you know if you have read the Book of Mormon, why these missionaries should try to convert the American natives. The Record was about their ancestors. Their people, were once "a white and delightsome" race, and they should become like their forebears if they would believe in the Christ. Besides, it would be a very humane thing to change these wild barbarians into a civilized people and save them in the Kingdom of God. There was another reason, too, for this journey, of which we shall speak in the next chapter, a reason which was hardly thought of at the time, even by the Prophet himself. The missionaries undertook this journey just as winter was approaching, and they meant to make every mile of it on foot! What faith, what devotion these men had! WHEN they reached the town of Kirtland, in Ohio, they stopped for about two weeks, to do some preaching. You see, this part of the State was the old home of Parley P, Pratt, and he wanted to let his friends there know about the new Church. That was only natural. The presence of the missionaries" created a sensation in the place. - In Oliver Cowdery they had a man who had been a close friend of the Prophet's almost since the very first. He had helped to translate the book. He had seen the angel and the plates and the urim and thummim and the breastplate. More than that. Oliver had been with the Prophet when John the Baptist and the three ancient apostles had laid their hands on the two young men and ordained them to the priesthood. And Oliver bore testimony to the truth of all these visions and divine manifestations. No wonder the missionaries created a sensation. Well, to make a long story short, they baptized sixty persons here. Among these converts were two ministers, Sidney Rigdon and John Murdock, and a physician, Frederick G. Williams. Dr. Williams wanted to join the mission on its westward journey, and so the five men trudged through the deep snow on their way to the border. Meantime, a man named Simeon Carter, living a few miles out from Kirtland, read the Book of Mormon, which the missionaries had left with him. He was converted. Then he went to Kirtland to the branch of the Church which the missionaries - RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE, JANUARY - 73 had organized. Here he was baptized and ordained an elder. On going home, he preached to his neighbors and baptized sixty of them. Thus the number of Latterday Saints in Kirtland and vicinity grew to one hundred and twenty. Questions 1.

Pratt; about Orson Pratt. 3. Who were some other early converts? 4. Tell about the mission to the Indians. Who were the missionaries? What did they do in Kirtland? What knowledge had Oliver Cowdery? What was the effect of their ministry? Ee PARADE By Edith Lovell I don't know why I want to cry When I see a parade Go marching by; I cannot see Why I should be So suffocated, so afraid When people march light-heartedly. Unless the beat Of marching feet Echoes upon the blood and grime Of some far-off and ancient street; Unless perhaps, this woman's heart Remembers how to play the part Of woman since the dawn of time When soldiers off to battle start. Or could it be This heart of me By some design has been endowed With the gift of prophecy? These foolish fears For future years, Could they be omens of a cloud Which holds a flood of bitter tears? Though mine may be a craven soul A voice has whispered low to me: "You were not given flesh and blood And life to maim humanity." 74 - JANUARY, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE ~ADVENTURING By Amy M. Rice I do not live inside four walls; I soar with thoughts of man To peasant cot, or marble halls, Or desert caravan. I loiter in enchanted woods And take my merry way Along with fairies, knights, and kings Through paths of yesterday. I hear the echoes rise and fall On distant snow-capped hills, And pause beside a castle wall To live a thousand thrills. When tired or discouraged, I go to Galilee To hear the gentle voice of Him Who stilled the angry sea. Each day I joy in living, For someone's magic pen Will take me where I want to go Adventuring again.
