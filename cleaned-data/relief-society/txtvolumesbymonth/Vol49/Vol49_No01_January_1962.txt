May you prosper in your desire to be better, more devoted wives, sweeter, more understanding mothers, and harder working, more dedicated handmaidens in the kingdom. May your homes be warm with love and lighted by faith. May your hearts rejoice in the goodness of your children. May your every act be keyed by kindness and your neighbors blessed by your thoughtfulness. May your courage enable you to surmount trials and obstacles. May your heart and mind be alert to ways your life and the lives of members of your family can be made more beautiful. May your love of freedom and the great gift of personal free agency lead you to help in prospering the cause of peace on earth. May you find strength in your religion and feel the security of perfect faith and trust in our Father in heaven. May we all accept the opportunity a new year affords to begin anew, to further resolve to live righteously in accordance with the commandments, and to give the service that will prosper the work of the Lord and his Church. Ima ad fe sue re Srom Near and Star The Clark Branch was organized in May 1961 as a branch of the Southern Far East Mission. We are located about sixty-five miles north of Manila, at Clark Air Base. Most of our members are military personnel and civilians working for the government here, but we do have six Filipino members, with prospects for several more in the near future. We are sure that the addition of The Relief Society Magazine to the San Fernando Library a local Filipino library will assist in this work and will be appreciated by the Filipino people. —Paul H. Sharp Branch President Clark Air Base Philippine Islands The Relief Society Magazine has brought me much happiness, and I enjoy thoroughly the messages contained within the covers of this wonderful and informative book. Every day I am more and more thankful for the knowledge of the gospel of Jesus Christ. We as a family are thankful for the servants who came to us just three years ago with the message of the everlasting gospel. —Norma E. McGill Nitro, West Virginia My husband and I both are very much pleased with our beautiful Relief Society Magazine, especially the beautiful covers. —Mtrs. Peggy A. Nyman Kalamazoo, Michigan Several years ago, my daughter, Mary Ober, of Alhambra, California, sent her old Relief Society Magazines to a young Chinese Filipino schoolteacher, Aurora Ang Fan, in the Philippines. These were greeted with such appreciation and acclaim that I am now dispatching mine, I hope, in time for Christmas. They help the students to read English and do missionary work for the Church. —Mrs. G. A. McCrimmon Seal Beach, California Page 2 I want to thank you for the article on books and reading for young children ("The Precious Words, July 1961, by May C. Hammond). I consider Mrs. Hammond to be my friend, and through her years of study and teaching, she has gleaned much knowledge about the field of children's literature. —Mary Lee Smoot Dallas, 'Texas I enjoy The Relief Society Magazine very much, especially the stories. I am a convert to the Church for nine years now, and a new citizen of this wonderful land of the Lord since the 8th of August. We have not had much education in schools, but life itself has educated us. I send you my love. —Mrs. Johanna Van de Coolwyk San Francisco, California Being a constant subscriber to The Relief Society Magazine for over twenty-eight years, I have learned to love the great spiritual uplift of the Magazine. 'The courses of study have been arranged by inspired men and women and answer the need for divine guidance in the home. Helping to make ready for a Relief Society banquet, these words came to my mind, and they were used on individual placecards: If you would find life's enrichment, Strong faith in Jesus Chuist, Satisfaction for time well spent, A plan for your life's guide, Then at Relief Society keep a tryst — The door is open wide. —Evelyn S. Grant Centerville, Utah I would like to thank you for the wonderful Magazine. It gives me so much help and inspiration. I enjoy every department and look forward to each issue. —Bettina C.

Page 3 Keep the Commandments President Joseph Fielding Smith Of the Council of the Twelve [Address Delivered at the Officers Meeting of the Annual General Relief Society Conference, September 27, 1961.| T is a wonderful sight to look into the faces of you good sisters and see this Tabernacle filled. It is a wonderful work that you are doing, and I commend you, I pray for you, and I add a blessing for you in the work which you are called upon to do. We could not get along without you. Frequently, almost daily, I get a letter from someone who is troubled in spirit because of the conditions which prevail in the world today. These conditions have been predicted. 'They were spoken of by our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. The Lord has called our attention to them in his teachings to his disciples when he was on the earth, and in the revelations of the Lord. We are living in critical days, but days that have been spoken of by the prophets since almost the beginning of time. You sisters have a glorious work to do laboring with the sisters of the Church and teaching them to keep the commandments of our Eternal Father. The Savior said "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15). Never in the history of the world has the need of keeping the commandments of the Lord been made manifest more than today. I get letters almost weekly from people asking questions about conditions, the conditions prevailing in the world, the distress and Page 4 the trouble, and the fears in the hearts of people, wondering what in the world we can do. There is one answer to that. 'They want to know if they should build bomb shelters and take other methods of protection. I am not prepared to talk about matters of that kind, but I am prepared to talk about one kind of protection, and that is keeping the commandments of the Lord. I have opened my Book of Mormon to the fifth chapter of Helaman. In this chapter I discover counsel that was given by Helaman to his sons. He had some very good, faithful sons. When Helaman began to get old, like his father did before him, he gave counsel to his sons. I want to read you a paragraph. And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall (Helaman 5:12). Now that counsel is just as good to sisters and daughters as it is to sons. We belong to the kingdom of God, the kingdom that has been set up according to the revelations KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS the Lord has given to his prophets of old, never to be thrown down or given to another people, the kingdom that is to grow and spread until it eventually will fill the earth. Now you good sisters are playing your part in this great undertaking of bringing to pass righteousness and truth and a love of God in the hearts of the members of the Church. We ought to be grateful that we live in this day, notwithstanding all the fears and _ the troubles and the anxiety which come upon us because of conditions that prevail in the world. E have security, the security of the protection of our Father in heaven and his Son Jesus Christ, but that protection is based on our faithfulness in the keeping of his commandments. 'There is no other security. In fact, there never was security in any other way, only in obedience to the commandments of the Lord. Now, as you travel and as you hold your meetings with our good sisters scattered throughout the Church, tell them there is a protection far greater than the building of places of protection in the earth. The Lord has promised to guide his people and bless them on one condition, that we keep the commandments of the Lord, that they are true and faithful before him. There is no security in any other course. It is the duty of our sisters, as well as it is of our brethren, to search the scriptures, to become familiar with the things the Lord has revealed. The promises he has made, the covenants he has offered to us, and to walk with understanding and in faith. In the revelation 5 given to John, he saw Satan in all his power, laboring among the children of men in the day in which we live, more determined, more energetic perhaps than ever before in the history of mankind on this earth, and John records he was industrious, energetic, because he knows he has but a short time. We are living in the days of fulfillment of prophecy. We are living in the days spoken of by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, that were to precede his second coming. 'The signs, many of them, that he enumerated are here, we can see them. Signs in the heaven, signs in the earth, the perplexity, the distress of nations, men's hearts failing them for fear. We are living in that day when the Lord said these things would take place here. We have all the evidence that anybody could need to know that the signs the Lord predicted were to come upon the face of the earth, before his coming, are here. Now I don't mean to say that every sign has been given; there are other things yet to come, but the distress in the world, the wickedness, and men's hearts failing them, everyone fearful for fear destruction will overtake them, all of this was told and recorded by prophets of old and our Savior when he stood with his disciples in his ministry before his departure from them. OW I want to read you another scripture from The Doctrine and Covenants on this same point: And, now, behold, if Zion do these things she shall prosper, and spread _herself and become very glorious, very great, and very terrible (D & C 97:18). 6 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1962 Do what things? Just keep the commandments of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. And the nations of the earth shall honor her, and shall say: Surely Zion is the city of our God, and surely Zion cannot fall, neither be moved out of her place, for God is there, and the hand of the Lord is there; And he hath sworn by the power of his might to be her salvation and her high tower. Therefore, verily, thus saith the Lord, let Zion rejoice, for this is Zion — THE PURE IN HEART; therefore, let Zion rejoice, while all the wicked shall mourn (Ibid. 97:19-21). Now there is a great blessing and promise the Lord makes to the members of the Church, protection, guidance, to give unto them his laws and direct them in mnghteousness and truth, and they will be called Zion, which is the pure in heart. Now I cannot stop the reading of this at this point because the Lord says something more, what he adds to what I have read is the part that troubles me and I want to do my part, as far as I can, to keep our people in the paths of righteousness and truth that they may be the pure in heart and have the protecting care of our Father in heaven and his Son Jesus Christ. Oh, I wish we could make all of the members of the Church understand this. We have those among us who have hardened their hearts, who are dull of hearing, and as the prophets have said, even in Zion, who love the things of this world more than they love the things of the kingdom of God, and whose ambitions are centered upon worldly things, the things that perish, and so the Lord is under the necessity of adding something, and so he says: For behold, and lo, vengeance cometh speedily upon the ungodly as the whirlwind; and who shall escape it? The Lord's scourge shall pass over by night and by day, and the report thereof shall vex all people; yea, it shall not be stayed until the Lord come; For the indignation of the Lord is kindled against their abominations and all their wicked works. Nevertheless, Zion shall escape if she observe to do all things whatsoever I have commanded her. But if she observe not to do whatsoever I have commanded her, I will visit her according to all her works, with sore affliction, with pestilence, with plague, with sword, with vengeance, with devouring fire. Nevertheless, let it be read this once to her ears, that I, the Lord, have accepted of her offering; and if she sin no more none of these things shall come upon her; And I will bless her with blessings, and multiply a multiplicity of blessings upon her, and upon her generations forever and ever, saith the Lord your God. Amen (Ibid. 97:22-28). OW, it is my duty to cry re pentance, to teach our people, to try to get them to walk in ways of righteousness and truth. It is your duty as sisters to teach your sisters that they may do likewise, just as it is the duty of all those who hold the Priesthood to cry repentance and teach our people to prepare themselves for the coming of the Son of God. Now, the Lord is not going to tell anybody when he will come. He is not going to tell me or anybody else, but he will come when least expected; when people KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS are full of this world and its affairs rather than the things that pertain to the kingdom of God. So I plead with you sisters in your labors to keep yourselves humble, that you may go forth and teach in your various organizations, build up and strengthen the sisters, and counsel them to teach their husbands and members of their families that they, too, may realize the importance of obedience to every command the Lord has given us. Now, the Lord said "This is not a day of many words," but I feel to talk to you in this manner at this particular time, due to the fact that the hearts of our people, many of them, are failing them. 'They don't know what to do, where to run, where to hide, fearing dreadful destruction may overtake them. We have one way of escape and that is the best, and that is the protection of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, 7 providing we will keep his commandments. The Lord bless you good sisters. I am grateful for you and for the work you are doing and for your loyalty, and for the integrity and loyalty of these good sisters who preside and who direct you in your labors. The Church of Jesus Christ is not a Church governed by one minister. The Lord has spread the work so that every member of it may have some important duty to perform. 'The Lord has called this organization and the other organizations of our sisters into existence for the building up and strengthening of his kingdom. I am sure your good brethren, I being among them, love you for the great work you are doing and the integrity of your hearts. We pray for you, we uphold you, we want you to walk in the light and the understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ. In the name of the Lord, Jesus Christ, Amen. Words Witten in White Ida Elaine James Today, the world is chastened. Through quiet snows Upon the streets move common mortals, white With winter's luminous aureole; each goes To find his dream or his despair, each bright With brief, ethereal beauty. The quiet air Is pregnant now with loveliness that sifts Magic alike on aging cheek and hair And heads of children laughing down the drifts. There is no sorrow through a world of slow And muted wonders such as these that bring Pulse to the buried wish of long ago, Strength to forgotten prayer, the blossoming Of light, from out a world of death and frost, To April dreams the heart has somehow lost.

She New Year Viola Ashton Candland What can the new year mean to me? A golden opportunity, A gift of time from God above To grow in wisdom and in love. What can the new year bring to me? A sense of true humility, A love of God, an urge to pray, To draw near unto him each day. What can the new year bring to me? More strength to meet adversity, A lamp of faith to light the way Of loved ones, lest they go astray. I hope the new year lets me see My great responsibility To live and teach the gospel plan And foster brotherhood in man. I hope it has in store for me More tolerance for humanity, More tact to guide the errant youth, More diligence in seeking truth. I pray the new year lets me know The joy that day by day will grow, If I but strive to serve the Lord And hearken to his holy word. I pray that it will bring to me The peace and sweet serenity That comes from knowing God is near To bless me in the coming year.

Hill They are all said, and silent — The cool green words of rain, Songs warm with summer, September laughter — gone Turn by turn Between the white beginning And the whitening end. Faces are swifter than sight: We may not recognize One April by a smile, Nor eyes of June long-shadowed; Small October kisses Are fallen to timelessness And here is a cold handclasp. Still this moment holds the mind: Now, link of the lost known To not-yet-discovered, Explores its winter cell. And where we turn towards newer years This old one and I part Friends.

The prize-winning poems, together with photographs and brief highlights on the prize-winning contestants, are herewith published in this issue of the Magazine. Page 13 Page 14 First Prize Poem She Other Mother Muiranda Snow Walton No book of Holy Writ records her name; She lived and died unknown, although her son Became a sign for infamy and shame — Judas Iscariot, the evil one. She must have dreamed of him, as mothers do, The months she cherished him before his birth, And watched with pride and gladness as he grew To manhood's stature, great upon the earth. When she beheld him on that blessed day Follow the Holy Man of Galilee, How could she see the cross along his way, A premonition of the pain to be? But when his sin of avarice was paid Its wage of death, what anguish did she know! Surely her soul walked with him, hurt, afraid, Along the tortured trail they both must go. Fain would she have suffered in his stead, Taken his retribution as her own, But in a potter's field her son lay dead By his own hand. She drained her cup alone.

They've never heard the milkman on his rounds, The clink of bottles, hurried steps tiptoe. They cannot hear a hymn or lullaby, A mother's voice wrapped softly round a name, A night train's whistle or a coyote's cry, For town or country silence is the same. The thud of ball on bat, the lilt of laughter Received in silence colorless as frost Are subtle arguments for what comes after, Some heaven where no joy is ever lost, Where man's equality is not belied And heaven grants each child what earth denied. Page 16 Miranda Snow Walton, in expressing her happiness as a winner in the Eliza R. Snow Poem Contest, describes the contest as "'a goal for me to work for." Now a resident of El Monte, California, Mrs. Walton was born in the upper Bear River country of Uintah County, Wyoming. "As a girl I knew all the rigors of pioneer life.

I was graduated from the University of Utah Normal School and taught two years in Lehi. I married David Wangsgaard and spent two years in Mount Pleasant, Utah, where Mr. Wangsgaard was a high school teacher.

Sirst Prize-Winn ing S tory Annual Relief Society Short Story Contest Ten Dollars Will Buy Many Things Mary Ek Knowles MARY EK KNOWLES \ ' 7 WEN Sarah Delaney reached 'the bank, there were already long lines of people waiting before the four tellers' cages. Her dark eyes quickly counted each line and she chose the one closest because there were two people less. | | She told the boys: "Sit over there on those chairs against the wall." Eddie said, "But, Mama, it's such a big line." He looked up at her, his blue eyes and the shock of red hair that had escaped his helmet hat making him look so like his father that she had a sudden hurting inside sharper than the day Bert died. "Hurry, Mama," Matt said. "I'm tired." "I know, darling." This was Matt's first day out since he had measles, and his five-year-old face was thin, some of the baby roundness gone. There had been the long wait for the bus in the cold, and they still had to walk to the other end of town to buy shoes at CutRate Shoe Emporium. She bent down. "When Miss King drives us home maybe she will stop at Eddie's Diner, if her father isn't too tired." May King was her neighbor. She had told Sarah, "I have to take Dad to the doctor. If you're at the shoe store when I'm done, [ll drive you home." 'This would be a big break with the weather so bad. "You can each have a twentyfive-cent treat," she told the boys. They hugged her knees. "Oh, boy! Gosh, thanks, Mom." Then Eddie said, "Come on, Matt." She looked after them as they ran for a chair and sat stiffly on the edge. 'They were such wonderful boys. When Bert died eight months ago, ten-year-old Eddie had taken over as man. Of the house. He called for Matt at the nursery every day, and, when Sarah got home from the office, the table: was set for dinner and the kettle was boiling so she could have a cup of hot instant chocolate. Sarah couldn't afford fifty cents for a treat, but the boys had earned it. As she moved slowly along with the line, she looked at her weekly Page 19 20 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1962 paycheck, knowing where each penny of it was going. She had a good future at the law office, and she was going to night school to learn shorthand, but right now they lived from payday to payday with very little left over. And this paycheck was smaller, because she had had to lay off work for four days and take care of Matt. HE boys had to have good stout shoes. She hoped Cut-Rate could fit them. She finally reached the teller's window. 'The middleaged teller had sparse hair and his mouth turned down at the corners. He took her check, asked grouchily for identification, then, satisfied, counted out bills, then rechecked and counted again, acting as if his mind was on something else. 'Then he said shortly, "Next!" Sarah picked up the money, put it carefully i in her billfold. "All right, boys," she called. Outside, the snow had turned to a blizzard. She knelt, buttoned Matt's jacket to the top, fastened Eddie's cap under his chin, pulled her knit hat down over her dark hair. Five blocks in this! Maybe She should go to Anderson Shoe. She could telephone May at the doctor's office to meet them there. Then she remembered that the money she saved at Cut-Rate would buy the boys each two pairs of warm stockings. And the shoes were good. It was just that you waited on yourself, and the styles were last-season styles. "Come on," she said. "Let's go." Eddie took hold of her jacket, Matt clung to her hand, saul heads down, they walked north. The going was rough, and at the end of the third block, Sarah pulled them into a doorway. Matt was crying, "I'm cold, Mama. Let's go home. I don't want new shoes." She was cold, too. Her car coat had been meant for driving in a warm car. She saw their bus coming and almost weakened, then remembered that it would be a week before she could bring the boys from the suburbs where they lived into the city, and their shoes would not last another week. "We can get through this," she said gaily. "Let's pretend we are on our way to the North Pole, and the first one who gets there can put up the American flag and." "And the enemy is going to try and beat us there!'' Eddie entered into the fantasy. They covered the last two blocks in record time, and then they were in the warmth of the shoe store, and the boys were sitting on chairs, and she was hunting through the racks of shoes. She was in luck and found a sturdy, thick-soled pair of Shoes for each of them. Her heart yearned over a pair of overshoes to protect them, but that would have to wait until next month. It was when she went to pay the clerk that she found the extra ten dollars. While the clerk was wrapping the shoes she sat down and counted her money. The shoes were her only purchase, and she'd had only small change to begin with. She remembered how absent-minded the teller had been. He had given her ten dollars too much! "What's the matter, Sarah?" She looked up and May King was standing there, a blue scarf tied over her gray hair. "I have ten dollars more than I should have," Sarah said. "Good for you," May laughed FIRST PRIZE-WINNING STORY shortly. May had been a good neighbor to Sarah. She had been so kind when Matt was sick, sitting with him while Sarah went to the store, but there was a streak of hardness in her. May had never married. She talked constantly of her great romance with a Fred Dallas. She'd had to turn him down because her mother had a stroke, and none of the other brothers and sisters would take the responsibility. And now her eighty-year-old father had to be taken care of. "pur, of course, I can't keep it, May," she said. "Why not? The bank has a vault full of ten-dollar bills, and you certainly can use it." That was true. 'Ten dollars would buy many things. It would buy the overshoes, or she could give Dr. Swanson something extra. He had taken care of Bert during a year's sickness and had waited so patiently for his money. He had four small children. He could use ten dollars, and the bank certainly did have a vault full of money. And then, suddenly, she was a little girl and mother was telling her: "Honesty above all, Sarah. Don't take as much as a straight pin that doesn't belong to you." "Oh, I couldn't keep it, May!" "Why not?" May asked "Because it's not mine, and keeping it would be stealing." She suddenly remembered how cross the teller had been. Maybe he had a reason, a very sick wife or a mortgage note to pay. "The teller would have to pay the money out of his own pocket." "Well, that's his tough luck," 21 May said. "He's paid to be ackeep it. I've got to take it back." "Suit yourself." May shrugged her shoulders. "But I can't wait. Dad's in the car and he's hungry and cross as a bear. But let me tell you, if I hadn't been such a softheaded fool." She went on and on telling the story May had told so many times before, how she had taken care of her sick parents and Ed and Jack and Shirley had just turned their backs on her, and so Fred had married another girl. Sarah looked after her neighbor as she walked out of the store, feeling sorry for her. May's father had told Sarah, "Fred was never in love with her. She just imagined it, and she has ruined her life thinking she missed her big chance." "Aren't we going with her?" Eddie asked. "No, son. The bank." Matt began to cry. Treat." "You'll get your treat, honey," she said. "I promise you." "Don't cry any more, Matt!" Eddie said sternly, but he, too, looked after May's plump figure. The five blocks back to the bank were cold and wet, the wind had risen and the icy pellets of snow peppered their faces, but they finally reached the bank. There was, thank goodness, no line to the middle-aged teller's window and she walked right up to him. She saw the name plate. "Thomas Eddrington." "Mr. Eddrington," she said, "when you cashed my check you made a mistake. You." "You should always count your I have to go back to "T want a 22 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1962 money before you leave the window." He shrugged his shoulders. She almost turned on her heel and stalked out. May was right. It was his headache, not hers. Her voice shook. "You gave me ten dollars too much." "Oh." His face turned red. He hastily counted through the bills in his till, compared the amount with figures on a sheet of paper. "Yes, 1 am ten short' Bat he didn't thank her. He almost snatched the bill from her hand. Sarah turned slowly and. Looked at her tired, patient little boys. "Now," she said with a brightness she did not feel, "now for that treat." "Td like a hamburger," Eddie said. "With French begged. In the Elite Lunch, Sarah ordered only root beer for herself, but she couldn't even drink that because she was suddenly nauseated, remembering the way the teller had acted. He could have said, "Thank you." Maybe May was right and she was a big fool. Fries!"" Matt HEN they arrived home it was almost dark. She fixed hot chocolate for the boys, read to them, and, finally, they were in bed. There was a knock at the door. It was May. She held out a pan of freshly baked cinnamon buns. "Thought you might enjoy them," she said. Sarah knew it was her way of apologizing for not waiting to drive them home. "Why, thank you," Sarah said. May asked, "Did the teller say, "Thank you, kind, honest lady?' " "No." Disappointment and anger washed over Sarah. "He acted as if it were my fault." "Was he a bald-headed man, sour looking?" May's eyes narrowed. "Thomas Eddrington?" "Why, yes, that was his name." May laughed. "And you dragged your little boys five blocks through a blizzard to give him ten dollars. Thomas Eddrington is a bachelor. He learned to play the stock market, how to invest his money. Why, he owns two buildings downtown. He owns an apartment." "Then why is he working in a bank?" "Because he loves money. He likes to handle it, count it, earn more, even that small salary. Besides he hasn't anything else to do." May added wryly, "He needs that ten dollars like he needs another row of toes! "Listen, Sarah," May said. "You're all alone now, and you've got two boys to support. You have to be a bit more clever, a bit more ruthless than the next guy, or you will get stepped on. Believe me, Sarah, I know. If only I'd told my brothers and sisters, 'Mother and Dad are your responsibility. I'm going to marry the man I love.'"' Her neighbor looked so miserable, so unhappy, that, even as upset as Sarah was, she said a little prayer for wisdom to show May that she had served a wonderful, useful life caring for her elderly parents. Tomorrow she must make her see that she was blessed, that she would be more blessed as time went on! "Stop being a sucker," May finished, a gentleness in her voice. After May had gone, Sarah leaned against the closed door and cried quietly, tears sliding down her cheeks. She cried because she FIRST PRIZE-WINNING STORY missed Bert's arms around her, because she was afraid of the responsibility of rearing her two sons, because the code by which she had been reared wasn't good any more. How could she teach them what was right when she didn't know what was right any more! But most of all she cried because she was disillusioned. She had done the right thing, the honest thing, but it had turned out to be a foolish thing. After awhile she stopped crying and went through the automatic movements of finishing the dishes. She heard Matt cough. She went into the bedroom to cover him up. Eddie was asleep, the covers thrown off. She covered him, kissed him lightly on the forehead. He had left his light on. She walked over to turn it off and saw his "Captain's Log," as he called it, open on the stand. BERT had known he was dying. He had spent a lot of time talking to the boys. He had told Eddie, "Being a man is a big job, but it doesn't happen all at once. Each day you learn something that helps you when you are a man." And he had given Eddie a large journal. "This is like a Captain's Log on a ship. Each night the captain writes what has happened during the day, and every night you must write down what you have learned during your day." Toward the end Bert had told Sarah, "I seem to talk in platitudes: 'Good is rewarded — As the twig is bent so the tree grows..." things like that. But there is much I want 23 to teach the boys, and there is so little time left. I don't know if 'm getting through to them." Sarah had never read Eddie's journal. She respected his privacy, but here it was open and her eyes skimmed lightly over what he had written. Systematically he had numbered his day's findings, writing in a careful, childish hand: 1. It takes a long time for the bus to come in winter. 2. New shoes make me feel taller. 3. The hamburger man liked cooking for us. He was happy we ate every bit. Sarah smiled fondly, surprised and pleased that Eddie had had the insight to know that the hamburger man enjoyed watching them eat his cooking. And then she read No. 4, and for a moment the words blurred through her tears. She brushed them away and read again, going sick inside thinking back to the moment when she had almost gone with May, unaware that all she did and said was being taken as gospel because she said and did them. "No. 4," Eddie had written, "If you have something that belongs to someone, take it back, even if you have to walk five blocks and it's snowing and your boys are crying. Because it doesn't belong to you and you have to give it back, even if somebody else says keep it, don't be a sucker." And he had added, capitalizing each word, "Honesty Is The Best Policy." "Amen," Sarah said softly. She closed the journal and walked out of the bedroom, her head held high as befitted one who had been tried and not been found wanting.

Did wax strong... And were blessed according to the multitude of the promises which the Lord had made unto them (Fourth Nephi 10-11). OW that a New Year of promise is beginning, we have before us again the precious gifts of life and time. It is well for us to rejoice in our opportunities and our privileges, and to remember the steadfast promises which have been given to those who are willing to become "partakers of the heavenly word." In the book of Fourth Nephi, a scripture of but few words yet adorned with great promises and profound wisdom, we are told of the happiness and the blessings which came to the people during a long period of time in which they held the gospel as a light before them and as a guide for their footsteps... "and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God" (Fourth Nephi 16). Spiritual hope and a measure of spiritual serenity come to us when we realize that the principles of the gospel are eternal. All doctrine and all commandments have been given for our personal direction and for a guide to us in our family relationships, in our activities in the Church, and in our wider responsibilities of truly being the keepers of our brothers and sisters. It is well for us, and it is a source of strength and comfort to know that the more we discipline and develop ourselves and keep our bodies Page 26 and our spirits strong — so, in like measure, shall we be able to strengthen those around us. Not one among us can give to another that which he does not himself possess. Hope and faith and courage may be radiated, beautiful and warm as sunlight, from one who has cultivated well the blossoms of the spirit. As a circle of treasures within the home, each member of the family chastens and polishes his own immortal spirit and lends a glow to all the loved ones. The father in the circle of prayer expresses his gratitude for the household of faith, and the small voices, in different words, uplift themselves and others in prayer. Within the Church, in all its auxiliaries, in each organization, with its particular duties and responsibilities, the individual participant is blessed with spiritual growth, and in his relationship to others he may become indeed his brother's keeper. For a certain period of time, a person may be a learner and a listener within a group, and then he may be called to be a leader, and in both positions there is strength to be given and blessings to be received, in that fellowship of growth and accomplishment which Fourth Nephi speaks of as walking after the commandments "which they had received from the Lord." EDITORIAL Relief Society women find joy and fulfillment in strengthening themselves and yielding strength to others. At one time a woman may be a listener in the class; at another time she may be seated with her companions and deftly work her needle through the satin of a quilt; she may be at evening time in the quiet of her home studying the longlasting words of a poet whose work will be the subject of tomorrow's lesson. A Relief Society woman may go forth with her companion on errands of love and solicitude as a visiting teacher; later, the visiting teacher may become a president or a counselor in Relief Society, and 27 will possess the wisdom and devotion which her other callings have developed within her. In each and every calling, she will know that giving and receiving are but different facets of a treasure passed from hand to hand. She will know that spiritual gifts are not for one alone, but are most radiant and glorious when they are shared in the worldwide sisterhood. For us and all the world, the year is new. The commandments and the gospel, the promises, are old and everlasting. 'They are ours to receive and share as "heirs to the kingdom of God." —V. P. C. Zine. Beginning in February.

She was lost ~ somewhere in the Malibu mountains, in country new to her, on terrain inhospitable and bleak. Nina Karsh reined Dominick in, and the mare came to a dancing halt. Nina braced against the jolts and patted the damp mane. Dominick whinnied, pleading to be allowed the reins. Nina rubbed the arching, golden neck. "You are beautiful, Dominick, but you are not clever, and I do not think you know the way back any more than I do." Her voice was pushed against her by the silence. Nina took off her gloves and looked about. There are different ways of being lost, she thought. Within myself I have been lost — since Father died, since Laura and David moved to Milwaukee, and terribly lost since Danny went away. The thought of her nephew made him rise in the brush, a tall and vital mirage. A fox yipped in the underbrush, down in the canyon a heavier body crackled its way. Nina trembled. Who would know if anything happened to her? How vulnerable she was in her loneliness. She looked about. She had been so engrossed in her problems, so busy thinking of Danny and wondering what he was doing, and if he were happy at the medical school, that she must have come miles inland without noticing. She scanned the hills about her. If she could just get to the top of one and find Page 30 a view of the sea. But, with the sun gone down over the ridge, it was difficult to tell which way was west. The canyon was narrowing, the hillsides growing more steep. Perhaps she should go back the way she had come, but there had been cross paths here and there. She noticed in the hillside ahead a narrow, twisting path. She coaxed Dominick toward it. Dominick was not eager, but he was amiable. "T shall most certainly buy you," Nina promised, "and you and I will live on that absurd hilltop and make it beautiful for Danny when he comes home this summer. I shall learn to live there," she continued briskly. But at once all her defenses crumbled, as they had a habit of doing, and she found herself crying inwardly, Danny! Danny! Why don't you write? Are you so glad to be gone from me, then? Was it lonely and awful for you all the years of being brought up by an aunt instead of a mother and a father? I tried, oh, Danny, how I tried. The years seized at her, Danny on roller skates, then a bicycle, then the car. Danny with the Mother Goose books, and then the Tarzan books, and the science fiction, and suddenly nothing but the sober tomes of anatomy and science, Latin and German.... "I've decided to bea doctor... As my father was." Fiercely telling her this, as if she SOW THE FIELD WITH ROSES would snatch his desire from him. She hadn't wanted to do that at all. She had only wanted to help him achieve his desire. But Danny had gone alone into the world of medicine. He had closed the door between them. He wanted to walk the path by himself, which, after all, was only a normal desire. Only only it left her so suddenly empty. She had made Danny her whole life. The earth is treacherous by the sea, given to sudden slides. Dominick plunged on the slipping earth, rocks rattled past them. Nina held the reins lightly. What a dolt she had been to ride so far without thought of where she was going. Dominick climbed up the steep slope, picked her way over a barbed wire fence that had been cut and trampled. Nina sighed with relief as they left the edge of the gully, where the earth crumbled under the horse's hoofs. She took a deep breath and looked, about her, and saw that the sun was almost lost in the sea. It would be dark very soon even here on the hilltop. She saw, to her dismay, that she should have climbed the other side of the gully for the great chasm was now be- ' tween her and the coast. _ QHE lifted her head to the sudden sound of galloping hoofs. Dominick wheeled in the direction of the sound. Two men rode hard toward them. Against her will and _her quick pride, Nina felt a wave of fear. The men did not look | friendly. There were two of them. The taller of the pair reached her first. He was a great, gaunt rock of a man with a carved granite face and " extraordinary eyes. The eyes, piercing her own, were gray and chill. | 31 His hair, under the dusty black hat, was red, as were the hairs on the backs of his hands. Something familiar in the turn of his face caught Nina. "You are Tomas Novarro?" She looked from him to the wide sweep of land and mountain, gully and plain. "You own all of it. 1 was just reading." Novarro swung off his mount and knelt by the trampled fence. He picked up a strand and eyed her accusingly. "You did this?" "Of course not. I wouldn't know how to cut a fence." His aide galloped up and stared suspiciously at Nina. He clambered down from his horse and went to kneel beside Tomas Novarro. 'Together they examined the fence and the ground. "This is the third time, Mr. Novarro." "It was done by a crowd." 'Tomas Novarro stood up angrily. 'Look at their footprints. I think it was part of the rioters at the beach. Boys!" He turned to glare at Nina. "What business do you have up here, anyway? 'This is private land! Mine!" Nina smiled in what she hoped was a winning way. "I'm lost. I had to climb up from the gully to see where I was." "Where do you live?" he demanded. She was forced to confess, "I'm not terribly sure. I just moved into the house. The agent told me it was one of yours." The two men consulted each other wordlessly. 'The aide snapped his fingers. "Your grandmother's house." He looked coldly at Nina. "It is a small house," he stated, "with much Bougainvillaea, and a bell?" Nina sighed with relief. "Exactly." She took up the reins briskly, 32 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1962 "Now if you'll tell me what direction to take to get there." Tomas Novarro pointed down the gully. "Go back the way you came, when you reach the road, turn left. After awhile you will recognize your surroundings." "But, Mr. Novarro!" the smaller man was plainly disturbed, "your grandmother's house is only down this plateau a little way. She is right about getting lost in the gully." "Be still, Manuel." Novarro's voice was curt. "This will do two things. It will teach this lady that I meant what I said about trespassers, and it will keep another fence from being cut." Nina sat back on Dominick. "You are joking, Mr. Novarro." Novarro's eyes met hers levelly. "T have little sense of humor, but I do have a strong feeling for what is mine." HE said coldly, "Let the thought occur to you that it might be dangerous to send me back down the hill. I am not an experienced horsewoman, and I am even less equipped to spend the night in the canyon.' "You will be much wiser in the morning Miss." "Nina Karsh." "Ah!" Interest leaped into the cold eyes. "You are the nurse whose picture was in the paper." Nina wet her lips. All the brief confidence she had forced into herself vanished. "I am not a nurse...."' She had to take a breath. "I am an aide. The whole thing was greatly exaggerated." 'Now I know!" Manuel regarded her with warm interest. He lapsed into a furious Spanish. "It wasn't true... What the papers said." Nina leaned forward, the familiar helplessness engulfing her. "I wasn't out of my mind it was the nurse who was hysterical." Tomas regarded her with a calm, searching scrutiny. "But you did thrust her into the closet and lock the door. You did leave her there?" Nina felt ill. He phrased it so badly. I suppose it will go on as long as I live, she thought, people hearing the story and looking at me and wondering.... She said fiercely to herself, I will not try to defend myself again ever... No one be lieves me. "T left her there," she said aloud. She lifted her head. "I am or rather | was an aide. I was to take the child to surgery. When I went into the room the nurse, Miss Pincus, was trying to give her a shot | —the little girl fought it, and Miss Pincus became hysterical...." She looked at their faces, which revealed nothing. "We had had a long outbreak of flu. Miss Pincus had been on duty double shift, and was tired and upset. It wasn't really her fault. I meant to go back and unlock the door and... And help her. But it was too late. Miss Pincus said I... Had suddenly done this... They believed her." A thin smile pulled at the corner of Novarro's mouth, "And for this humanitarian gesture they discharged you?" "I had taken matters into my own hands. I had taken the child to the sun room to talk to her and quiet her before I took her upstairs. I was insubordinate... But the newspapers decided to "make something of it." Manuel listened intently. He said SOW THE FIELD WITH ROSES in English, "My cousin Donna says this lady is a painter, with many canvases and much colors." Nina moved uneasily on the restless back of Dominick. It was absurd the whole thing, sitting here, waiting for the tall man's judgment. Why didn't she go? She could move in the morning. But the mere thought made her limp. The little house, on its lonely hill, had seemed sanctuary and haven. She could not bear to go. It was a place where she could paint and hide... Yes hide, until the wounds were healed. She lifted her chin. After all, what could this Tomas Novarro do to her? She had paid her rent for months in advance. She had signed the option that said she could, if she wished, purchase the little house. So why should she be leaning over Dominick's golden neck, tense and anxious, for the tall man's verdict? OMAS Novarro lifted his head. His face had changed. It had grown almost warm, almost gentle. "Follow me. T'll take you to your house. Manuel, ride ahead and cut the fence for her." "Oh, thank you." Gladly she turned her horse at his gesture and trode after him. Novarro reined in his horse. "You come from the East?" "Yes. My father was ill. We had just lost my sister and her husband in an accident, I had their little boy, Danny, to rear. This climate has been very kind to us." "Your father?" "He died... And Danny is a grown young man, he's gone East to medical school." She bit her lp. "Danny was is a wonderful person. I miss him very much." 33 "You are not married?" Her patience was at an end. "No," she said curtly and galloped ahcad after the disappearing figure of Manuel. What night did this man have to ask all these questions? Did he-expect her to turn and say, "Yes, once there was a boy I loved.. Very much. But when my sister and her husband were killed, when my father's health failed, when Danny cried in loneliness and fear, I could not leave them, and the boy could not wait." She looked about her at the fast darkening hills. 'The pain had never gone away. The years had made no difference to that first and tertible loss. Tomas Novarro galloped up. "Was it important to you the child's crying? After all, she was a stranger to you? Why didn't you pass by? You could have returned after a discreet interval." Nina regarded him steadily. "I am thirty-nine years old," she said, "and that is a nice distance into maturity. I have learned many things, but not yet to be a bystander where a child is involved. I'm sorry." "Thank you, Miss Karsh." He pointed down the hill. "There is your house, and Manuel has cut the fence." Nina slowed down to a walk. "It must be wonderful to own so much." Novarro gave her a brief smile. "All this has been my people's for a very long time. It was one of the first great Spanish land grants. My father lost most of it. My mother never quite forgave him for that." "Nor have you," she said and bit her lip. His face darkened. "I have made 34 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1962 up for it. I have lands in Mexico and in Texas and in Canada. No one will take anything of mine away from me." Nina looked at his red hair. "Not all your people were Spanish." "My mother was English. She had pale hair, like yours, but her eyes were brown, not blue, like yours... She had a_ beautiful skin." "T freckle easily," Nina said, burning under his glance. She got down from Dominick and led him around the barbed wire. But when she would have mounted him again, she found herself without a stump or a rock to stand upon and she was too short to reach the saddle. Novarro came to her, dismounted, and held out his hands. "No thank you." She was furious at the prim sound of her voice on the dark evening air. "Nonsense." He took her in his arms and lifted her into the saddle. "You are a very thorny young woman, Miss Karsh." He was laughing at her. For one long angry moment Nina fought the impulse to lean down and strike the smile from his face. "Good day, Mr. Novarro." "Goodbye, Miss Karsh. It has been most interesting." Arrogant, horrible, impudent man! Nina breathed other descriptions under her breath as she unsaddled Dominick and locked the gate of his small corral. 'HE walked slowly toward the darkened house. How beautiful it was here in this fast darkening night. 'The wind was making a song of its own in the chinaberry tree and the jasmine at the corner gladly of the house mingled its heady fragtrance with the orange blossoms, waxy and new, on the small bright tree. The long, pillared porch, with its ancient wicker furniture welcomed her. She touched the chairs in passing. Had Tomas Novarro's grandmother sat here in the long spring evenings, watching the lights spring up in the houses, far down in the valley, listening to the wild things moving in the thicket? A great bell hung in the last arch. Nina moved her hand lightly on the cold surface. The agent had hinted at some romantic reason for the bell, but grim realism had pointed out the necessity for such a bell in a region so lonely and so prone to fires. Nina swung the bell a little. She had never heard its tone. So large a bell would make a ringing that would bring the canyon people for miles around. She went into the house, turned on the lamps. That was the worst of living alone, coming home to darkness and to shadows that whispered and _ stirred. 'There was always a tense moment of standing still when the lights were lit, until a quick peering into corners gave the feeling that all was well. The living room was long and narrow, with a great stone fireplace at the far end. Nina went to it, took a match from its box and lighted the shavings under the logs. The fire leaped up. The room became rich with gilding light and flame. In the small kitchen Nina made herself a bowl of bread and milk. She brought the frugal meal back to the hearth. She sat in silence and ate. It had been a long day and a strange one. How Danny would have listened while she told SOW THE FIELD WITH ROSES him about it. She missed him so much. But soon he would be here. All summer long his whistle would plague the mockingbirds. He would be delighted with Dominick. N impulse she put aside her bowl and went out of the house, down the long, dark, winding path to the road where the mailbox stood. He had not written in weeks, but when she thrust her fingers into the box she was at once rewarded with the rustling of an envelope. She raced back to the house. 'The letter was from Danny. How foolish she had been to fret and worry. She tore open the envelope and read the hasty lines. You would love Joan, Aunt Nina. She is so tall and beautiful. Her people have lived in Philadelphia since Benjamin Franklin, and the way they talk, you would think he was still alive. So we're going to be married, at the end of June.... Invitation on its way.... So we'll live here. Her-uncle is in pediatrics, and I rather think that will be my line. He seems to want me to go in with him, and he is getting on in years. Nina let the paper drift to the floor. The fire had settled down to softly flaring ashes. She stared into them. Face yourself. Someone had said that about agonies. Nina walked woodenly to the long mirror by the door. Her pale hair, as that man, Mr. Novarro, had described it, was bright around her face. Her blue eyes looked back blankly; the freckles were very clear in her pale face. She was thin and not beautiful as women were beau- 35 tiful today. She was too slight. Too understated... People had difficulty remembering her name. That was why they had looked at her askance in the hospital. She did not look like a woman who would do a rash, impulsive thing. She had nothing of talent... Well, perhaps her painting. She looked at the canvases on the wall. Were they good? Were they bad? Her father and Danny had been loudly approving, but she had not summoned courage to display them. Once she had read that when a door closes it is then that another door might open. But since Danny had gone, there had been only a succession of quietly closing doors. She had not known how wide a world he had given her. Nina looked around the room curiously. It was all in_ perfect order. Then why did she have the impression of ruins about her feet? Why was there suddenly terror in the sound of the wind and the falling pods from the eucalyptus tree? Where does a woman go, when there is no place to go? What does she do with the empty years, when she is no longer important to those she loves? Suddenly through the house rang the imperious summons of the great brass knocker on the ancient heavy door. Nina stood frozen, waiting for the sound to repeat itself, trying to envision the hand that lifted the knocker at this late and lonely hour.

Thomson UTH lay on the bed and wept for a long time. Alone! Here in Kirtland on the edge of nowhere, the baby almost due, and Vic gone! And living among people, most of whom she still considered strangers. At last, her fury spent at Vic for being able to even think of leaving her now, she sat up and looked dully around the tiny room. The house! 'That was it! With Vic gone she could negotiate openly and even be moved in the new house when he returned. She slid heavily from the bed, walked to the washstand and poured cold water from the pitcher. She splashed it again and again over her swollen eyes. Inwardly, she knew that this was her way of repaying Vic for what she felt to be gross inconsideration. With everyone else giving their all for the temple, or to build up Zion in Missouri, he would be more embarrassed at her buying the house right now than he was when she wore a different kind of dress to church. Ruth put on her bonnet and started for the temple lot. This was where she would find Mr. Smathers who owned the house. She saw Mary out in the yard as she passed, but did not stop to chat. She remembered talking to Vic about Mr. Smathers, old and crippled with rheumatism, when Vic had mentioned the pain the old man suffered. "Why doesn't Joseph or someone Page 38 send him home where he belongs?" Ruth had asked. "And break an old man's heart?" Vic had answered. "This isn't just a building to him, Ruth. It is the temple of God. He has said many times that it is the greatest privilege of his life just to work on it." "You're always saying how they need every able-bodied man _ they can get. I have no quarrel with that," Ruth had continued, "but anyone can see that he certainly isn't able-bodied." "He can stand guard as well as anyone," Vic had answered quietly. "Someone has to, or the actions of the mob right here in Kirtland would prevent the temple's ever being completed. Besides, he gives invaluable advice on how to build it, from his long experience. He has a new idea for finishing the outside." Ruth could see the old man as she drew near, seated near the front of the building, working with hammer and chisel on the great pile of stone. His gun lay nearby. S the Prophet had said, the work was going forward, though Ruth could see that the working force was much smaller than usual. Strange, how in her own mind, she always referred to Joseph as the Prophet, just as Vic did. Mr. Smathers recognized her at once and knew also why she had come, from their previous conversations. BECAUSE OF THE WORD "Mrs. Hall,' he said, reaching out his hand, the fingers drawn forward by years of pain. "You want to know about the house, I reckon. Well, it's still for sale. That little one of yours will suit me better anyway, since my wife has gone on. I'd be right proud at my age to be able to make a sizable contribution in money to the temple. I work every day all right, but no use fooling myself about how much work I can do." "Oh, Mr. Smathers," said Ruth, "you make me so happy. I'll love having your house, and I'll take care of it just as your wife would have." "T'm sure of that, and, because I am, I can sell the house. You see, I built it just as my wife wanted, and it was only finished a few short years before she died." 'The old man was silent for a moment, a faraway look clouding his eyes, then he said, "When would you like to move in? Not until Brother Hall gets back, I suppose?" "That's just it," said Ruth. "I want to surprise him." "But, Ma'am," said Mr. Smathers shyly, "you — you're in no condition to be doing a lot of heavy work, if you'll excuse me for saying it." Ruth smiled. "That's true, but since it is all right with you, I will see if I can get enough help to manage it. 'The money is ready anytime." Then she looked again at the temple. "The work keeps right on," said Ruth, "even though so many men did go on the expedition." "Yes," said Mr. Smathers, rising stiffly to his feet. "Come inside and see how much progress has been made." 39 Ruth followed the old man, stepping carefully among the bits of smaller stone that lay on the ground. 'They stood inside the great rectangular structure, the bright May sky brilliant above them. In one corner near the door, Ruth noticed a pile of dishes, some whole, some broken odds and ends, on a piece of canvas. "What is curiously. "We're asking the sisters to give pieces of china that they can spare. It will be made into a fine dust and added to the final outer coating of plaster. I saw it done once. Made the building glisten as if it were set with jewels when the sun hit it." "How very interesting," said Ruth. "Vic told me that you knew many things about building. Well, I must be going now. Ill see what I can do and talk to you again in a few days." Trying to find an_ available wagon and team and a man who had time to move her belongings was more of a task than Ruth had counted on. The expedition had taken at least twenty teams, besides many other horses. Other than those busy hauling materials for the temple, there did not seem to be any other horses in all of Kirtland. Mary was busy in preparations for her wedding planned for August. The two girls spent many afternoons together, sewing either on something for Mary or clothes for the temple workers. Her days passed pleasantly enough, but many times in the night Ruth awoke, trembling with fear at nightmarish dreams, with Vic himself in the hands of the mob. Sometimes, Ruth found herself that?" she asked 40 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1962 unable to sleep, lighting the lamp and reading the book far into the morning hours. If she only read long enough, she told herself, she would invanably doze off. Ruth knew the Bible fairly well, and as she read of Christ's visit and teachings to the Nephites her soul thrilled with the similarity and beauty of his words. BY July, she began to look daily for Vic's return. One rainy afternoon, which Mary as_ usual spent with her, realizing the nearness of Ruth's time, Ruth insisted on beginning to pack in preparation for moving into her new home. "But, Ruth, you mustn't," tested Mary. "But I must," answered Ruth. "If Vic gets back and hears what I have done, he likely will refuse to move at all. If the weather stays bad, I'm sure I can get someone to come and help for a day." Ruth knew she felt unusually tired, as Mary prepared to leave for the night. "T hate leaving you alone tonight. Perhaps I should stay." "IT really don't feel like myself, Mary. I " A bright flash of lightning cut through the room, followed by an eatth-shaking clap of thunder, drowning out Ruth's words. In the brightness of the flash, Ruth's face was contorted with pain. _ "This is it, Mary!" she cried. "Run for Mrs. Hunter! Hurry!" But this was not it, at least not until after many pain-filled, weary hours had passed. During an interval between pains, Ruth asked Mary to read something to her from the probook. The words came to her vividly and clearly. - And now, as I said unto you, that because ye were compelled to be humble ye were blessed, do ye not suppose that they are more blessed who truly humble themselves because of the word?... Therefore, blessed are they who humble themselves without being compelled to be humble; or rather, in other words, blessed is he that believeth in the word of God, and is baptized without stubbornness of ligast.... Ruth felt the force of the message more strongly than even the pain that encompassed her. It was enough. At last she knew the truth. HEN Ruth awoke, the sun was high and Mrs. Hunter was leaning over her bed. "Sister Hall! Sister Hall! You're going to be all right! You have a wonderful, beautiful son." Vic's baby. And it was a boy. It meant something that her first thought had been for his happiness rather than just her own. This was what Vic himself would have done. All this time she had been fighting the very part of him that had first made him so dear, his ability to set his own affairs aside in the interest of others, his kindness, his thoughtful consideration. Through the open door, Ruth could hear the low voices of several women. Word had been passed along and she knew that they had come from their sleep, willing and eager to be of help. She could smell something cooking and realized how good a bowl of broth would taste. Then Mrs. Hunter returned to the room and placed the baby by Ruth on the bed. Looking for the first time at her son, it seemed that BECAUSE OF THE WORD all the events of her life had been aimed at this moment of fulfillment. During the time she was regaining her strength, Ruth wondered often how she could ever have thought of the women of Kirtland as strangers. 'They took complete charge of her, the baby, and the house, and the feeling among them made Ruth realize that when they called each other "sister," they meant it, indeed. It seemed that nearly everyone in the village called. Ruth was not surprised when even Mr. Smathers arrived to get a glimpse of the new baby. "IT wanted to see you, Mr. Smathers," she said, taking the gnarled, old hand. "T suppose you will be more anxious than ever to get into the house," he said. "Mighty fine baby, Mrs. Hall." "That's just what I wanted to talk to you about. Mr. Smathers, I know you dislike the thoughts of leaving your house. I have decided not to buy it." "But I do want to make a contribution, and I have no cash nor can I see any way to raise some right now," protested the old man. "The contribution will be made," said Ruth, "and partly in your name. No, don't try to stop me. Seeing your faith has given me something more precious than all the houses in the world. Vic was right when he said yours was truly a faith like that of the ancients." Ruth prevailed upon Mr. Smathers to take care of the transaction and noticed how proud he looked as he limped away from the little house. She knew that Vic's satis- 4] faction in what she had done would be not a shade less than her own happiness. Still, the past weighed heavily upon Ruth. She felt so unworthy of this peace and well-being that filled her soul, even in her desperate loneliness for Vic. She had entrusted him to the care of her Father in heaven and had relaxed her worry for his safety. Vic had given all that he could, his time, his efforts, and had borne her taunts and reproaches without complaint, doing what he knew he must. 'The desire to make further compensation grew strong within her, yet what more had she to offer? Then an idea came to her. T was on the first afternoon that the sisters who had become so dear to her, finally agreed to leave her alone, that Ruth had a chance to put her plan into action. She found an old piece of wagon cover which she spread out on the table. Then she walked out in the yard and picked up a rock. No use looking for a hammer. Vic had long since taken every tool they had to the temple lot. Inside again, she reached the dishes down from the top shelf. Working quickly, she pounded one piece of the china and then another into fragments, feeling a severing of her former intense desires with each blow. So engrossed was she in the task that she failed to hear Vic's footsteps until he spoke. "Ruth!" he cried, clasping her hard by the shoulders. "Ruth! Whatever are you doing? Have you lost your mind?" "Lost it, Vic? No, I haven't lost 42 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1962 it. I've found it! I have found, at last, the testimony you have been praying for." Vic turned her slowly toward him and she heard him catch his breath. "Ruth! The baby." "Asleep in the bedroom," she said, smiling up at him. "He's a little copy of his father." "A son! We havea son!' Ruth saw the wonder and the love in his eyes. "Ruth, Ruth, and I left you to bear it all alone." "I wasn't alone, Vic. Not by any blame yourself for going, Vic. I have only now begun to realize what it cost you to go. But, come. See your son." Together they looked down at the sleeping babe. Vic reached out his hand and touched the tiny fist. The fingers closed around one of his. Ruth watched Vic, his face glowing with happiness. At last she said, "Come on. Get a rock and help me pound up the rest of the dishes. You must take them to Brother Smathers up at the temple to use for the walls. If we hurry there means. I never knew how kind may still be time for me to be bappeople could be.

Footsteps, footsteps, here and there Searching, hunting everywhere — In the wood, through the heather, Facing sun or stormy weather. Some lead over the rocky ridge, In dark places where the light Dims the way, obscures the sight; Missing flowers along the way, Singing birds, the sun's bright ray, Gentle clasp of friendship's hand And many beauties of the land. Footsteps, footsteps, lead aright, Walk in paths that bring delight. Let our footsteps ever be A pathway to eternity. FROM THE FIELD |?

LESS N ) LESSON DEPARTMENT Sheology—The Doctrine and Covenants Lesson 39 — The Revelation to William W. Phelps Elder Roy W. Doxey (Text: Doctrine and Covenants: Section 55) For Tuesday, April 3, 1962 Objective: move the kingdom of God forward. ANY men of exceptional talent joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints not long after its formal organization in the spring of 1830. The Lord knew the needs of the Prophet and the men who could help him most. Among those who had indicated a desire to join the Church at this early period was William Wine Phelps who will long be remembered by the saints because of his contribution to the hymnology of the Church. He made his impress upon the history of this dispensation in many other ways, however. According to the Prophet's journal, William W. Phelps and _ his family arrived in Kirtland, Ohio, about the middle of June 1831, as the Prophet was preparing for his first journey to Missouri. Because Mr. Phelps desired "to do the will of the Lord," the Prophet inquired of the Lord concerning him and the Page 50 To study the contribution of a talented Latter-day Saint who helped revelation (Section 55) for study in this lesson was received. (See D. H. C, 1:184-185.) Background of Section 55 William W. Phelps was in his fortieth year when he came to Kirtland. Before this he had been active in politics in New York State and | had been the editor of a newspaper for the Anti-Masonic Party. It was while thus employed in Canandaigua, New York, only a short distance from Palmyra, that he bought a copy of The Book of Mormon which had just come off the press With an intimate knowledge of the Bible, he and his wife compared it with The Book of Mormon. A few years later (1835), he wrote this about the influence The Book of Mormon had upon him: From the first time I read this volume of volumes, even till now, I have been struck with a kind of sacred joy at its LESSON DEPARTMENT title page. What a wonderful volume! What a glorious treasure! By that book, I have learned the right way to God; by that book I received the fulness of the everlasting gospel; by that book I found the new covenant; by that book I learned when the Lord had set his hand the second time to gather his people; by that book I learned that the New Jerusalem, even Zion was to be built upon this continent; by that book I found a key to the holy prophets; and by that book began to unfold the mysteries of God, and I was made glad. Who can tell his goodness, or estimate the worth of such a book? He only who is directed by the Holy Ghost in. All things; and has kept all his 4 commandments blameless through ife. [The above quotation, with other biographical material in this lesson, is taken from an unpublished thesis written by Walter Dean Bowen of the Church Seminary System. | William W. Phelps' conversion to the gospel through The Book of Mormon had given to him and his wife a desire to meet Joseph Smith. This was accomplished toward the end of December 1830. Of this event, Brother Phelps recorded his feelings as follows: Now, notwithstanding my body was not baptized into this church, yet my heart was here from the time I became acquainted with the Book of Mormon; and my hope, steadfast like an anchor, and my faith increased like the grass after a refreshing shower, when I for the first time held a conversation with our beloved brother Joseph who I was willing to acknowledge as a prophet of the Lord, and to whom, and to whose godly account of himself and the work he was engaged in, I owe my first determination to quit the folly of my way, and the fancy and fame of this world, and seek the Lord and his righteousness, in order to enter a_ better world Such was the impression made upon Brother Phelps by the Proph- 51 et. The way had been prepared, however, by the witness of the Holy Ghost to his soul. Section 55 Six months later, the Lord, by revelation, called upon Brother Phelps to be baptized. Significantly, he would not be chosen unless he was obedient to the commandment given. 'The Lord calls men, but only a relatively few are chosen because their thoughts and aspirations are upon the things of this world. The essential message of the gospel for the investigator is given in verse 1 of this revelation (D & C 55:1). Every convert receives a remission of sins by obedience to the commandment that his faith and repentance are sincere, with the intent that his act of obedience to baptism will be pointed to the glory of God. It is the Lord's work and glory to bring about the eternal life of man. Acceptance of the gospel requires that the person's efforts will be turned into furthering the Lord's work in every possible way. Another important truth is indicated in this verse when it is understood in its historical background. Brother Phelps had already received a testimony of The Book of Mormon by the Holy Ghost; yet, he was told that if he was baptized in the water the Holy Ghost would be given to him by the laying on of hands. Why was it necessary for Brother Phelps (and all converts) to receive this gift, if he had already received the Holy Ghost? The brief answer is as follows: the Holy Ghost which convinces the investigator of the truth will not remain with him unless baptism in water is accepted, and also the laying on of hands for 52 the gift of the Holy Ghost. Not until the authorized servant of God bestows this gift by the power of the Priesthood does the person have the "right" to retain the blessings of the Holy Ghost. (See lesson 32, "The Gifts of the Holy Ghost," Relief Society Magazine, February 1961.) Phelps' Baptism There are probably many ways that the Lord has brought great persons of talent into his work. An understanding of some teachings of the gospel was a factor in the case of Brother Phelps, although he had already received the testimony of the Holy Ghost Of his conversion, he once wrote: I was not a professor at the time, nor a believer in sectarian religion, but a believer in God, and the Son of God, as two distinct characters, and a believer in sacred scriptures. I had long been searching for the "old paths," that I might find the right way and walk in it, and after a suitable time to investigate the work, and prove its truth by corresponding evidence from the old Bible, and by internal witness of the spirit, according to the rules of holiness, I embraced it for the truth's sake, and all honest men who seek a better world, will "go and do likewise'"' (Messenger and Advocate, I:115). Obedient to the revelation, Brother Phelps was baptized on June 16, 1831. Because of William W. Phelps' prominence in New York State, seyeral newspapers made note of his becoming a member of 'The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. A General Assignment Continuing the revelation, the promise is made that upon his baptism, Brother Phelps would be ordained an elder by Joseph Smith, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1962 and thus he would be able to preach repentance and baptism for the remission of sins. (See D & C 55:2.) Following this promise the revelation reads: And on whomsoever you shall lay your hands, if they are contrite before me, you shall have power to give the Holy Spirit (Ibid., verse 3). This promise to Brother Phelps was not intended for him alone, but it is a blessing which may be participated in by any worthy elder of this Church. In itself, it is an important truth. These following two facts are worthy of consideration: (1) By revelation in this day man may know that the power to bestow the Holy Ghost was never intended only for the Twelve Apostles appointed in the meridian dispensation; and (2) There is a way by which the elder may be able to see the evidence of his ministry in the lives of those whom he Serves. How would Elder Phelps be able to know, on the basis of verse 3 of this revelation, that he had not been deceived? As long as he worthily performed his duties as an elder and the person he confirmed a member of the Church had prepared himself with an "eye single to my [God's] glory," there should be manifest in the lives of those converts the fruits of the Spirit. The Lord promised many gifts of the Holy Ghost to the sincere believer. (See D & C 46:11, 26.) As these gifts were received and use made of them in healings, and other miracles, prophesyings, etc., the elder in the Church would be apprised of the power which he possessed as an elder. One may conclude that the LESSON DEPARTMENT steadfastness which Brother Phelps and many others demonstrated during their lives, aided by the Spirit, gave evidence of the promise given to faithful Priesthood bearers. Specific Calling The revelation addressed to William W. Phelps gave him an assignment which was suited to his special abilities. In these words, the Lord said: And again, you shall be ordained to assist my servant Oliver Cowdery to do the work of printing, and of selecting and writing books for schools in this church, that little children also may receive instruction before me as is pleasing unto me (D & C 55:4). This is the first time in the revelations in The Doctrine and Covenants that mention is made of schools in the Church. It should also be noted that this revelation (verse 5) commands Brother Phelps to accompany the Prophet and Sidney Rigdon to the land of the saints' inheritance (Missouri), where he would undertake the work assigned him The last verse of Section 55 assigns Joseph Coe also to be a member of the company. A brief account of this journey is found in the Prophet's writings (D. H. C. 1:188). In Jackson County, Missouri (July 1831), the Lord gave to the Prophet a revelation in which Brother Phelps was to be established as a "printer unto the church" at that place. Important in this connection is that the position of printer in that period was much more than a pressman; it also included the responsibilities of editor. It is said of such men that they had great versa- 53 tility and knowledge. In Section 57 Brother Phelps is told to "obtain whatsoever he can obtain in righteousness, for the good of the saints" (verse 12). The Evening and Morning Star With the call to be the printer unto the Church and work with Oliver Cowdery in publishing books for the Church, Brother Phelps purchased a printing press at Cincinnati. With the establishment of this enterprise and the issuance of The Evening and Morning Star, a monthly publication, the first periodical of the Church, there was great joy for the saints, as the Prophet recorded that although the press universally had sought to harm us, "the Saints rejoiced that they [editors] could do nothing against the truth but for it" (D. H. C. 1:273). In this periodical appeared many of the revelations which are now found in The Doctrine and Covenants and also a chapter and parts of three other chapters of the Book of Moses. It was published from the period June 1832, until the destruction of the press on July 20, 1833, at which time the Book of Commandments, the first compilation of revelations, consisting of sixty-five chapters, was being printed. (In 1835, The Evening and Morning Star was re-established in Kirtland, Ohio, with Oliver Cowdery as editor.) The first issue of the Star informed its readers that its office was "situated within twelve miles of the west line of the state of Missouri; which at present is the western limits of the United States, and about 120 miles west of any press in the state " (Ibid., page 277). There also appeared in the first 54 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1962 issue, the following counsel concerning the education of children: The disciples should lose no time in preparing schools for their children, that they may be taught as is pleasing unto the Lord, and brought up in the way of holliness. 'Those appointed to select and prepare books for the use of schools, will attend to that subject as soon as more weighty matters are finished. Since that time the Church has developed an educational system that has provided for the secular and religious education of its members. William W. Phelps' Career William W. Phelps was a man of great ability, with varied interests. Numerous were his contributions to 'The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and to the American frontier. His versatility of ability and interests is shown by the following occupations and offices held by him. He was "a printer, hymn writer, poet-journalist, newspaper editor, judge, orator, scribe, lawyer, educator, missionary, temple worker, member of city council, member of stake presidency, pioneer, explorer, writer of books and pamphlets, topographical engineer, superintendent of schools, surveyor general, weather man, chaplain of lower house of representatives, and speaker of the house in the legislature of the State of Deseret." In the years of 1837 and 1838 when many leading brethren apostatized, Brother Phelps was one of them. The members of the Church in Missouri withdrew the hand of fellowship from the local presidency of the Church, consisting of Brother Phelps, David Whitmer, and John Whitmer, because of disobedience to the word of the Lord. Notwithstanding the action of Brother Phelps which brought about his severance from the Church in the spring of 1838, the Lord still provided an opportunity for him to return to the fold in a revelation a few months later. (See D. H. C. III:46.) Later in the year 1838, Brother Phelps, with other former members of the Church, signed an affidavit against the Prophet in a court of inquiry. Ata conference of the Church in Quincy, Illinois, March 17, 1839, Brother Phelps was excommunicated. Several years later he confessed that this affidavit was made under duress and that his part of betraying his brethren was done to save his life. The Prodigal Returns In June 1840, William W. Phelps wrote to the Prophet asking forgiveness for the errors he had committed in Missouri. His confession and spirit shown in this letter indicate what was said earlier in this lesson, that he had received a witness of the truth, but he permitted Satan temporarily to overcome him. He wrote as follows:... I am as the prodigal son, though I never doubt or disbelieve the fulness of the Gospel. I have been greatly abused and humbled, and I blessed the God of Israel when I lately read your prophetic blessing on my head, as follows: "The Lord will chasten him because he taketh honor to himself, and when his soul is greatly humbled he will forsake the evil. Then shall the light of the Lord break upon him as at noonday and in him shall be no darkness," &c. I have seen the folly of my way, and I tremble at the gulf I have passed. So it is, and why I know not. I prayed and God answered, but what could I do? Says I, "I will repent and live, and ask my old LESSON DEPARTMENT brethren to forgive me, and though they chasten me to death, yet I will die with them, for their God is my God. The least place with them is enough for me, yea, it is bigger and better than all Babylon." I know my situation, you know it, and God knows it, and I want to be saved if my friends will help me.... I have done wrong and I am sorry. The beam is in my own eye. I have not walked along with my friends according to my holy anointing. I ask forgiveness in the name of Jesus Christ of all the Saints, for I will do right, God helping me. I want your fellowship; if you cannot grant that, grant me your peace and friendship, for we are brethren, and our communion used to be sweet, and whenever the Lord brings us together again, I will make all the satisfaction on every point that Saints or God can require. Amen (D. H. C. IV:141-142). The Prophet's Greatness In reply to this request, Joseph Smith extended the hand of forgiveness for himself and the saints. He referred to the suffering caused by Brother Phelps and said: the cup of gall, already full enough for mortals to drink, was indeed filled to overflowing when you turned against Ms However, the cup has been drunk, the will of our Father has been done, and we are yet alive, for which we thank the Lord. And having been delivered from the hands of wicked men by the mercy of our God, we say it is your privilege to be deliveredfrom the powers of the adversary.... Your letter was read to the Saints last Sunday, and an expression of their feeling was taken, when it was unanimously Resolved, That W. W. Phelps should be received into fellowship. "Come on, dear brother, since the war is past, for friends at first, are friends again at last" (Ibid., pp. 163-164). Brother Phelps' faithfulness after this was evidenced in many ways during his life. His testimony of the 55 truth was shown when he sustained the Twelve Apostles after the martyrdom of the Prophet. As a pioneer in the West, his contribution was great as already indicated in his numerous activities. Phelps, the Hymn Writer Many of the accomplishments and contributions of William W. Phelps have been forgotten by the members or are unknown to them, but there is one contribution made by him which will never be unknown. It was his great gift to write hymns. It is improbable that any one person has left his impress to a greater degree upon the Church in this way than has Brother Phelps. W. W. Phelps' Testimony The conversion of William W. Phelps came about from his reading The Book of Mormon. Upon meeting the Prophet Joseph Smith, he and his wife were convinced of the truth of what the Prophet had said concerning the reopening of the heavens and the revelations directing the establishment of the kingdom of God on the earth. Although there were times when he turned against the Church he had accepted as true, yet, he came through many trials and persecutions. 'Truly, the Lord had blessed him generously with many talents which he used for the advancement of his work. He was "called and chosen" as the revelation said. (See D & C 55:1.) Upon his return to the fold and until his death on March 6, 1872, in Salt Lake City, Utah, he continued firm in his testimony of the work instituted by God through the Prophet Joseph Smith. In the General Conference of April 1860, Elder Phelps 56 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1962 held in his hand a copy of the first edition of that Book [Book of Mormon| and declared it to be the truth of the Almighty; he had heard the testimony of Joseph Smith and that of the chosen witnesses in relation to the Book of Mormon, and he with them wished to give his testimony to the world relative to its divine origin. He said that he knew this was the church of the living God, and that Brigham Young was the legally appointed successor of Joseph Smith, and that all who receive this testimony will be saved in the celestial kingdom, and he wished he had a thousand tongues to speak of the great things of the kingdom to the nations of the earth (Deseret News, April 11, 1860). Questions for Discussion 1. Describe the effect of The Book of Mormon upon the conversion of Brother Phelps. 2. What effect did meeting the Prophet Joseph Smith have upon his decision to be baptized? 3. Why is it necessary for a person to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost if he has already received a testimony of the gospel by the Holy Ghost? 4. In the true Church an elder is promised a power which can be verified over a period of time. (a) What is this power? (b) How is it manifest? 5. Of what importance to the Church was The Evening and Morning Star? 6. Name some of the contributions of Brother Phelps to the hymnology of the Church.

In his great test before he died on the cross, the Savior uttered these immortal words of mercy, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34). The story is told of a well-known sculptor who was commissioned to do an heroic statue of the Savior. The sculptor was delighted and wanted to make this his best work. He labored almost night and day for months. Finally, he finished the clay model of what he considered to be a magnificent figure of the Christ — a commanding statue depicting strength, dominance, and leadership. The clay model was locked in his studio to set and when the LESSON DEPARTMENT sculptor returned and opened the door to his studio, he was shocked to see that his masterpiece was greatly altered from the way he had left it. Time, weather, and some unknown power had caused the figure to settle, the head had dropped forward, the arms and hands, which had been high over the head, were now appealingly outstretched. The change had brought an attitude of compassion and mercy into the figure which the sculptor had been unable to accomplish. Reverently, the sculptor looked upon his inspired creation and gave it the simple title, "Come Unto Me." Mercy is a Christ-like quality which, when it functions in our lives, will bring blessings of happiness both to ourselves and unto those to whom we are merciful. Shakespeare expressed thought when he said: this The quality of mercy is not strain'd, It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath: It is twice bless'd; It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes. —William Shakespeare The Merchant of Venice Act IV, Scene I. The quality of mercy is such an essential part of successful and joy- 57 ful living that the Lord has given it to us virtually as a commandment. In Luke 6:36 we read, "Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful." The Lord also _ said, "Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy" (Mt. 5:7). The grand key words "of Relief Society are, "Said Jesus: 'Ye shall do the work, which ye see me do.' " To be merciful unto others is an essential part of this work. In speaking to Relief Society sisters, the Prophet Joseph Smith said [you] "should be armed with mercy. Manifest benevolence." He also said, "If you would have God have mercy on you, have mercy on one another." As we apply this great principle to our own lives, let us remember that mercy means more than the absence of criticism and judgment. It implies kindness, consideration, understanding, and it seeks the highest possible good for those who might have offended us. When we practice the quality of mercy, we exhibit the true application of love to our lives and in our attitude toward others. Then, and only then, are we entitled to the promise of our Redeemer when he said, "*... With everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee " (3 Nephi 22:8). O—<_-- Our Ca tor Iris W. Schow He is the magnet drawing on our faith; The star of hope above our sands that shift; He is the universal charity, The Giver who accompanies his gift. Work ITleeting— Attitudes and Manners HOW DO YOU DO? (A Course Expected to Be Used by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting) Discussion 7 — Attitudes Make the Difference Elaine Anderson Cannon For Tuesday, April 10, 1962 Objective: To show that good manners spring from good thoughts and that a woman is most charming when she is being thoughtful. EOPLE too often' think of proper behavior and good manners only in terms of which fork to use when eating a salad. Actually, there are roles a woman of today is required to play for which there are not definite prescribed lines to say, or a list of rules of precisely what to do and when. These are the subtle requirements of being socially correct, aware and sensitive to situations. How we respond to these situations springs from our attitude about people and our basic relationship with them. Our tesponse usually determines whether or not we can be described as charming. In Glamour magazine, November 1960, these cautionary words were given on charm: If you are sure you have it, you don't. If you hoard it, you lose it. If you buy with it, you spend false coin. If you give it away, it bounces back (Reprinted by permission from Glamour, November 1960, Copyright 1960 by the Conde Nast Publications, Inc.). Elements of Charm The ideal attitude which should underlie all of our womanly behavior should express kindness, refinement, gentleness, self-respect, sympathy (though not necessarily Page 58 pity), and a certain amount of deference to one's husband, an older woman, or to a dignitary. Cultivated, these qualities can enhance our relationship with others in a most positive manner. Negativism, over-zealousness, criticism of others, including Church officers, organizations, and _ procedures, are practices which can easily slip into our way of behavior, unless we constantly guard against them. 'They can prove to be destructive to our personal relationships with others and rob us of serenity. We should try conscientiously never to hurt anyone's feelings. If we discover we have committed this error, we should pray for strength, guidance, and help in making it tight again with the injured person. The weakness of taking offense easily is as unjust as giving offense. One should pray just as diligently for a forgiving and understanding heart, if one has allowed her own feelings to be hurt. It is difficult sometimes to do this, but, nevertheless, it is important in mastering inner maturity and good will. It is unwise to harbor grudges, nurse hurt feelings, or foster unhappiness by clinging to injuries of the soul. LESSON DEPARTMENT Some examples of thoughtfulness which are charming and which spring from good thoughts (but are not listed rules in a book of ete quette) include: 1. Sending congratulatory messages' to the bishop on his birthday, or to a friend on her big day of achievement (chairman of a program, winning an honor, the arrival of a new baby, being the wife of a new bishop, stake president or branch president, etc.) 2. When advisable, it is thoughtful to make brief hospital calls and take some little gift, a few flowers, or send a cheery note or card. 3. It is thoughtful for the patient to send a small gift or a special card to a nurse who has been particularly attentive during one's illness. 4. It is an appealing mark of deference to bow ever so slightly when introduced to an important authority or to an older woman, also, when one sees an acquaintance across the room (rather than waying). It is refreshing to see a woman notice another's child, admiring the baby (without touching it!), or speak to teens on the Street (inspiring a gracious reply from them). The following are familiar phrases guaranteed the most unlikely to please: "When I was the work meeting leader. Oe e "Did you hear what someone told me about Mary?" "That wasn't the way I heard it. You have it all wrong." 29 "How much did it cost?" "My doctor says that's the worst thing you could do!" "Your child is a hard one to discipline, isn't he?" "Another meeting?" "Well I can't come to any of the practices, but I guess I could sing with you on the program." "Yes, this is a nice centerpiece, but you should see my tulips this year." "Don't expect me to work on a committee with her." "Can't you possibly get someone else to do it?" "Oh, this recipe is a failure today. I never can do it when I have to bring it over to the chapel." Facing Attitudes It is well to face our attitudes, for they face us! Our attitudes and appreciations, our thoughts and the actions that spring therefrom, our sensitivities and our responses line our faces, just as surely as a pen marks a paper. The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts, therefore guard accordingly; and take care that you entertain no notions unsuitable to virtue and reasonable nature (Marcus Antonius, from The New Dictionary of Thoughts). Questions for Discussion Using the above "phrases most unlikely to please" as a basis, restate them in words of charm and thoughtfulness. How do YOU do? ree America's Literature Comes of Age Lesson 31 — Edgar Allan Poe — The Pathos of His Life and Poetry (1809-1849) Elder Briant S. Jacobs (Textbook: America's Literature, by James D. Hart and Clarence Gohdes Dryden Press, New York, pp. 413-457) For Tuesday, April 17, 1962 Objective: To review Poe's life that we may more truly read his works. DGAR Allan Poe, generally recognized by the public as an author of great prose and poetry, has been subjected to more conflicting judgments by the critics than any other American literary writer. These diverse opinions concern both his personal life and his artistic creations. 'They range from such comments as 'T'ennyson's, ""The most original American genius,' to the slanderous portrait of Poe as portrayed by the Reverend Rufus W. Griswold, whom, most ironically, the naive Poe chose to edit his writings. Never in literary history has a literary personage committed a more catastrophic blunder. Poe made his living as an editor and critic, whose keen analytical powers were respected and whose courage and, sometimes, sharp tongue in saying exactly what he thought of his contemporaries, made him many enemies, among them Rufus W. Griswold. Griswold apparently never forgave Poe for publishing unflattering statements about his writings and those of his friends. Poe felt contempt for the current practice of publishing critical comments anonymously; he believed it... Folly to assert that the literature of any nation or age was ever injured by plain speaking on the part of critics. As Page 60 for American Letters, plain speaking about them is, simply, the one thing needed. They are in a condition of absolute quagmire (Southern Literary Messenger, July 1849). And Poe spoke plainly, indeed, as the following excerpt from a review testifies: Mr. Grattan [the author] has a bad habit, that of loitering in the road — of dallying and toying with his subject, as a kitten with a mouse — instead of grasping it firmly at once and eating it up without more ado. He takes up too much time in the anteroom. He is never done with his introductions... So that by the time he arrives at his main incidents there is nothing more to tell. He seems afflicted with that curious yet common perversity observed in garrulous old women—the desire of tantalizing by circumlocution.... If the greasy-looking lithograph here given as a frontispiece, be meant for Mr. Grattan, then is Mr. Grattan like nobody else — for the fact is, I never yet knew an individual with a wire wig, or the countenance of an under-done apple dumpling.... As a general rule, no man should put his own face in his own book. In looking at the author's countenance the reader is seldom in condition to keep his own (Southern Literary Messenger, April 1849). Prophet Without Honor Justly Poe might be described as having lived in the world, yet not of it. Although he is the one man in the English-speaking world who LESSON DEPARTMENT A Perry Pictur EDGAR ALLAN POE has achieved pre-eminence in the three literary realms of fiction, poetry, and criticism, still many adult Americans have always tended either merely to tolerate him, without really claiming him as one of their own, or to ignore part of him. But since it is just and inevitable that we admit his greatness as an American writer, it is equally just and inevitable that we face the life out of which his greatness came, that we may more fully appreciate and understand both the intent and achievement of his creations. Poe's Chronology Edgar Allan Poe was born January 19, 1809, to actor parents while their group was appearing in Boston. His grandfather, General David Poe, was quartermaster general during the American Revolution, and friend to LaFayette. Before he was three, 61 Poe's parents had separated and both had died. His mother died in Richmond, Virginia, where, out of pity, three wealthy matrons each took one of the three surviving children into their homes. Mr. John Allan, stern, practical Scotchman, had no children and desired none, but he yielded to the wishes of his younger wife and accepted Edgar, giving him Allan as his middle name. He provided Poe with excellent schooling in England and at the University of Virginia, but always resented him somewhat, though his wife was overly affectionate. First in his class at the university, Poe gambled to pay school expenses which he claimed Mr. Allan would not. 'They quarreled violently, and Edgar ran away to Boston. He published his first book of poems when he was eighteen, before enlisting as a private in the army. He arrived at home the day after Mrs. Allan's funeral, and entered West Point through Mr. Allan's influence, but soon asked permission to resign his appointment. When this was denied, he cut out enough classes to get himself discharged. He published his second book of poems and first prize-winning stories while living at the home of his aunt, Maria Poe Clemm, in Baltimore. When Poe was twenty-four he moved to Richmond to work full time on the staff of The Southern Literary Messenger, one of the most influential magazines of the day, soon becoming its editor. Mrs. Clemm and her daughter Virginia joined him there, and the next year he married Virginia, in her fourteenth year. 'Theirs was a most happy marriage, although Virginia, always delicate and sensitive, died 62 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1962 eleven years later. "Mother" Clemm lived with them until her daughter's death, then remained with her "adored Eddie" until his own death, in October 1849. The year following his marriage Poe moved his family to New York City, then to Philadelphia, where he soon became editor of Graham's Magazine. Having achieved success with his prose writings, he returned to New York City and for a time fulfilled his lifetime dream of editing his own magazine, but, when it failed, he moved his family to a humble cottage at Fordham, some miles outside the city, where their poverty became acute and Virginia died in 1847. Bewildered by grief and loneliness, Poe began lecturing widely. First he courted one widow in Lowell, Massachusetts, then proposed to another in Rhode Island. When a few months later their marriage plans were, by mutual consent, abandoned, he again attempted to find support for a new magazine he hoped to establish and edit. During a southern tour he met an old friend in Richmond, Virginia, and planned to marry her as soon as he could bring Mrs. Clemm from New York for the wedding. While on his way he suffered a mysterious catastrophe and was taken to a Baltimore hospital where he died four days later, on October 7, 1849. His death resulted not from "delirium tremens," as reported by Griswold (whom his attending physician, Dr. John J. Moran, defined as Poe's "avowed and personal enemy'), but from nervous prostration and the shock of having been beaten, robbed, and abandoned. In his A Defense of Edgar Allan Poe, published in 1885, Dr. Moran described in detail the sixteen hours preceding death when Poe was under his care, in rational consciousness save when he slept, and that he "did not die under the influence of any kind of intoxicating drink." Incensed at the malicious warping of the truth by Griswold, Poe's friends, N. P. Willis and George Graham, editor of Graham's Magazine, at once published defenses of Poe's character and reputation — in magazines, while Griswold's more extended "Memoir of Poe" appeared in every copy of Poe's works until late in the century, both in Europe and in this country. Several other friends published books in an attempt to correct the false picture which Griswold had made, but largely in vain. Griswold forged several letters, inserted and deleted words to change Poe's meaning and character, and so falsely accused Poe of duplicity in relation to his own charges of plagiarism against peaceloving Longfellow, that even Longfellow felt compelled to expose the falseness of Griswold's accusations. To maintain that Poe's private life was without flaw would be as untrue as were Griswold's errors and manipulations, for Poe was, on occasion, vain, sharp-tongued, and always intensely ambitious for success. As for drug addiction, a doctor testified that he was so unfamiliar with laudanum that when in a fit of depression he attempted using it, he didn't even know the proper dosage. He did drink excessively on occasions when his malnourished wife was dying or when sophisticated Bostonians walked out en' masse during his lecture, but he knew LESSON DEPARTMENT alcohol acted as a poison within him, and that half a glass of wine made him well-nigh insane, or, im Graham's words, "the least drop of wine, to most men a moderate stimulus, was to him literally the cup of frenzy." As for charges of insanity, Poe probably spoke truth when he said that "I was never teally insane, except on occasions where my heart was touched." Apparently, only two such _ periods occurred in his life: during the years of his wife's suffering and, intermittently, during the final days of his life. As Poe wrote, on January 4, 1848, "My enemies referred the insanity to the drink rather than the drink to the insanity." Particularly, after reading in Poe's stories more extended and gripping examples of this world of inward terror which so dominated his art, may we be willing to see how drinking was the effect rather than the cause. The editors of the most scholarly anthology of his writings (Alterton and Craig, Edgar Allan Poe, Representative Selections, American Book Company, 1934) write on page 543: "Of all the nonsense talked about Poe, and there has been much, none is perhaps greater than that which fails to see in him a man of fundamentally noble moral nature,' a statement which becomes more pertinent to his entire life and writings the more they are studied. Poe's first book of poems, titled Tammerlane and Other Poems was published in Boston in 1827. Most of these earlier poems reflect the disappointments and ambitions of youth and reveal the influence of English romantic poets, such as Coleridge and Byron. By 1831, when 63 another volume of his poetry appeared, which included the poems "To Helen," "Israfel," and "The City in the Sea," Poe had developed more sureness as a poet. The poem "To Helen" was, according to Poe, inspired by a school friend's mother who died when Poe was fifteen. Her kindness to the sensitive young boy caused him to speak of her as an angel to his forlorn and darkened nature. Yet in this poem ""T'o Helen" the idealized image is not flesh and blood, but a symbol of beauty in the land of heart's desire. Poe is representatively romantic in his portrayal of nostalgic yearning for a realm of serene beauty, in art, in myth, and in life, and in this poem the entire feeling is romantic, although the allusions and pictures are all classical. TO HELEN Helen, thy beauty is to me Like those Nicean barks of yore, That gently, o'er a perfumed sea, The weary, way-worn wanderer bore To his own native shore. On desperate seas long wont to roam, Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face, Thy Naiad airs have brought me home To the glory that was Greece And the grandeur that was Rome. Lo! In yon brilliant window-niche How statue-like I see thee stand, The agate lamp within thy hand! Ah, Psyche, from the regions which Are Holy-Land! "Annabel Lee," one of Poe's best known and best loved poems, supposedly refers to his own young wife Virginia who died at the age of twenty-four. (See text, page 455.) Written in 1849, the poem concludes with 64 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1962 For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; And the stars never rise, but I feel the bnght eyes Of the beautiful Annabel Lee: And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side Of my darling — my darling — my life and my bride, In her sepulchre there by the sea— In her tomb by the side of the sea. Next to "The Raven," Poe's most popular poem is "I'he Bells" which was much revised before Poe, in 1849, considered it complete. Many readers enjoy this poem for the tone and mood conveyed by sound and image. As the poem progresses, we become increasingly aware of words carefully selected for their particular music-tone. A unity of effect is achieved in each stanza by the use of descriptive words appropriately associated with a particular bell and its connotation. (See text, pp. 454455-) | Note that in stanza I, the silver bells of the sledge, with their tinkling, jingling sound are heard in the "icy air of night," while in stanza 3, alarum bells are loud, turbulent, brazen, and clamorous, and they clang into the "palpitating air." An interchange of any of these descriptive words would destroy the unity of effect Poe worked so carefully to create within each stanza. The poem must be read aloud to appreciate the music-tone of words and the vivid image. Spiritualism and mesmerism were current speculative interests of Poe's day, and Poe became somewhat interested in them as dramatic material for his art in story and verse. But the mysticism which more truly represents Poe was of a personal nature. It was refuge and adventure into the dark, mysterious regions of his inner self. No statement on his poetry, with its "indefinite," unattained beauty and its pathos, can be accurately made without taking into account the pathos of his sensitive and lonely life. Thoughts for Discussion 1. In what ways do Poe's writings reflect the unfortunate circumstances and_loneliness of his life? 2. How do the conflicting judgments of critics affect our evaluation of Poe as man? As artist? 3. Which romantic qualities do you find in Poe's poetry? (See Preview.)

Social ae The Place of Woman in the Gospel Plan WOMEN AND CHURCH ACTIVITY Lesson 6 — How Women Share in the Blessings of the Priesthood Elder Ariel S. Ballif For Tuesday, April 24, 1962 Objective: To increase our understanding of the way in which women participate in the blessings of the Priesthood. Priesthood is the divine commission for the operation of the Lord's Church. It is the right to officiate in God's name in all matters pertaining to the welfare of man under the plan of salvation. The major purpose of the plan is the eternal progressive welfare of human beings. The government of the Church is Priesthood in operation. Our Pionecr Women HE Church was restored through revelation and the authority of the Priesthood; but it was built and developed by men and women together. Often we speak of the strength of the men of this early period, forgetting the fact that in the pioneering period of this Church the strength of the women was a support to the men. 1. In the Beginning of Church Activities From the very beginning of the Church stress was placed on the importance of the family unit. The first years were full of sacrifice and suffering. 'The women had the allimportant task of holding the family together and supporting their husbands in their convictions of truth. The women endured the persecution and hardships without losing sight of their objectives, and family solidarity developed under these experiences. The teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith in regard to the eternal nature of the marriage covenant strengthened the family ties. The women accepted the persecution, hardships, and sacrifice with the determination to maintain the family structure. They were the developers of the influence that kept the spirit of the entire community on a durable basis. All during the wanderings of the saints the women were interested in the problems and suffering of one another and solved many of their difficulties through cooperative action. They gave courage to their husbands in the face of new trials and continued persecution. But even more important, the women were unwavering in their testimonies of the truthfulness of the gospel, and many took over the total family operation while their husbands filled missions for the Church. The strength of the Church today has been greatly aided by the strength of the mothers in this early period of trial. They taught their children the importance of the principles of the gospel. Most of them remained steadfast and true in the face of the most severe adversities. The mothers who had to provide the environment for the children Page 65 66 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1962 made it an environment of faith, hope, and love. The children of these pioneer homes, in general, grew up to be men and women of integrity and truth, who honored the Priesthood and gave to the Church the leadership that has led to its present progress. 2. First Organized Activity of Women in the Church The mothers of the Church, in addition to the operation of their own homes, extend their love and mercy to those in the community who are less fortunate than they. As early as 1842 the idea of combining time, materials, and the talents of the women to meet the needs of the workmen on the Nauvoo Temple grew to the point that the sisters planned to organize a Ladies Society. They submitted their plans to the Prophet Joseph who said:. This is not what you want. Tell the sisters their offering is accepted of the Lord, and He has something better for them.... Invite them all to meet me and a few of the brethren... Over my store next Thursday afternoon, and I will organize the sisters under the Priesthood after a pattern of the Priesthood (A Centenary of Relief Society, 1842-1942, page 14). He called the women together on Thursday, March 17, 1842, and organized the Female Relief Society of Nauvoo. The women of the Church tesponded enthusiastically to the new organization. It began with eighteen members and within two years it had grown to 1,341. It has continued to grow in importance in the lives of the people of the Church from then until the present day. The Relief Society's objectives under Priesthood guidance were the care of the poor, comfort to the sorrowing, and to save souls. The same objectives are listed for Priesthood quorums, to take care of the temporal, intellectual, and spiritual welfare of the quorum members and their families. The first Relief Society officers were aware of the importance of frequent personal contacts. In 1843 they organized "the necessity committee." The members of this committee, sixteen in number, were to discover the needs of each family and to accept contributions for the needy. 'This committee was the beginning of the visiting teacher program, still a most vital part of the Relief Society organization. The accomplishments of the Relief Society. Bear testimony to the faith, courage, vision, and industry of the women of the Church who have received "instructions through the order of the Priesthood which God has established, through the medium of those appointed to lead, guide and direct the affairs of the Church in this last dispensation" (A Centenary of Relief Society, 1842-1942, page 3). 3. Relief Society Services 'Today The Presidency of the Church and the Relief Society leadership have never lost sight of the original purpose of this greatest woman's organization. 'The distress and misfortune of the saints from Kirtland to Nauvoo and from Nauvoo to Salt Lake City, made lasting impressions as to the value of compassionate service of the women of the Church. There is still present in our society a great need for sympathetic understanding. Sickness, old age, poverty, death, and the tragedy of family failures make the need for LESSON DEPARTMENT compassionate service as demanding today as ever before. The faster our materialistic development is and the more dense our population becomes, the greater the need of benevolent service and sympathetic understanding. In this day the Priesthood has organized a Welfare Program designed to help meet people's needs through providing opportunities for work in conjunction with the united efforts of friends and neighbors as members of the Church organizations. It is an expression of the highest type of co-operative action. Where it has been developed, the men produce materials and foods, and the women prepare the materials and preserve the food. 'The over-all "aim of the program is to help the people to help themselves" (Welfare Plan Handbook of Instructions, page 1). The educational aspect of the Relief Society has been a medium of great stimulation to the sisters of the Church. The Relief Society provides a constant intellectual challenge to their membership to improve their minds to meet the requirements of a woman's function in today's world. The organization provides lessons in all areas of participation required of women, with special emphasis on strengthening testimonies, on motherhood and homemaking, at the same time providing a rich experience for all. Priesthood Provides Benefits for All Members The purpose of Priesthood is to improve all men and women, bringing them toward the perfection of God, the Eternal Father. "For behold, this is my work and my glory 67 — to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). 1. The Performance of Ordinances Is a Blessing 'Through the Priesthood We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands, by those who are in authority to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof (Fifth Article of Faith). Many of us are inclined to take the most important and_ sacred things for granted. Membership in this Church is basic to all the blessings the gospel promises. Yet too often the eighth birthday celebration is emphasized more than baptism, the attending of Church, and the meaning of membership. Those who come to the waters of baptism through conversion often are more conscious and appreciative of this important event than the child born in the Church. Every woman who is a member of this Church shares in the blessings of the Church through the functioning of the Priesthood. Jesus pointed out that we cannot enter the kingdom of heaven unless we have been born of the water and of the spirit. No one can perform the ordinances of baptism and confirmation without holding the Priesthood. Each Sabbath day we are reminded, encouraged, and permitted to renew our covenants with the Lord through the sacrament, a Priesthood ordinance. As a matter of fact, the Priesthood is a constant source of blessing to every member of the Church each day. A woman has full rights to the benefits of the administration to the sick. Often it is the faith of 68 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1962 I SACRED MUSIC FOR!

The patriarch, who has a special Priesthood function, is available to membership of the Church to provide them with a patriarchal blessing of enlightenment, encouragement, and clarification as to what course in life will bring the greatest accomplishment, the most satisfaction, and which will make possible the opportunity for exaltation in the presence of our Eternal Father. 2. Unlimited Possibility of Growth In the Doctrine and Covenants, Section 93:36, it says "The glory of God is intelligence..." and in Section 131:6, it says: "It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance." The quest for knowledge, faith, and love is equally as important to the woman as to the man who holds the Priesthood. She, too, is given her free agency and placed upon this earth to gain experience and progress toward perfection. Her understanding of life here and hereafter is of vital importance in giving intelligent direction to her family and for her own exaltation. Here again the Priesthood is responsible for and is the source of blessings. The Call to Service One of the richest blessings to a woman comes through the privilege of service in the Church. Every officer in the Church is called - by proper authority and commissioned by this authority. In the ward the bishop calls and commissions the worthy persons to their particular responsibilities. Every office andcalling in the Church is important, LESSON DEPARTMENT and to the individual receiving the assignment it is the most important assignment in the Church. No one else can do the work you are called to do while you are in the office. Your effective performance of the duties and responsibilities of your office gives strength to the whole organization. 'The privilege comes through the Priesthood, and _blessings come from your devotion to duty. We have stated before that the government of the Church is the Priesthood in action. Every office in the Church is therefore, to a degree, Priesthood work. As_ the Church has grown there has been a need for auxiliary help. As the term implies, the auxiliaries are assisting organizations to the Priesthood, but subject to, and under the direction of the Priesthood. The officers and teachers in the auxiliaries play an important part in the teaching of the gospel. But, as has been pointed out, teaching the gospel to all the members is a major responsibility of the Priesthood quorums. There are assignments to the women in the work that is assigned to the Priesthood. Women work on the genealogical committees and do both research and temple work for the dead. The missionary work which is to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people also uses the women of the Church. They are an effective part of the missionary program in teaching the gospel to people of the Many nations. Service in the Church is a blessing in and of itself. Through Church work you are serving the Lord by serving your fellow men. It tends to Teduce selfishness, and by doing 69 things for others it reduces tensions in your own life. We tend to love whom we serve. 'The Lord emphasized this to Peter when he asked i lovest thou me.. ' and Peter's answer was "yea " Then he said "Feed my sheep.' ' This he repeated, giving emphasis to the connection between, and the importance of service and love of God (John 21:15-17). Women's Service, a Strength to the Church The activity of the women in the Church program is a manifestation of dedication to a great cause. This is demonstrated by a situation in the mission field where three wonderful Maori ladies, old in years, but vigorous in the love of the gospel, held a little branch together for many years until the Priesthood holders were regenerated. These faithful sisters did everything but the ordinances, and they guided the young Aaronic Priesthood members in the care and administration of the sacrament. Many times the women of the wards and stakes have provided the activity necessary to the success of Priesthood projects. 'Through the efforts of the women in the home, the men are constantly built up and encouraged. They care for the children, assist their men in _ projects and programs, and provide leadership for the auxiliary organizations. The blessings in store for the women of the Church are limited only by the efforts they put forth to build the kingdom. Every effort they put forth in gaining knowledge, in exercising faith, and in performance of duty is a step toward perfection, and every step toward 70 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1962 Hawaiian Tour February Southern Temple Tour February Mexican Tour Leaving early March Mexico City, Cholula, Pueblo, Taxco, Cuernavaca, Acapulco, Archaeological Ruins Northwest Banff-Lake Louise Tour Including World's Fair at Seattle leaving June 23 Ask about our ALASKA and HILL CUMORAH TOURS ESTHER JAMES TOURS 460 7th Avenue SALT LAKE CITY 3, UTAH Phones: EM 3-5229 — EL 9-8051 e BEAUTIFUL e HANDY e DURABLE A sure way of keeping alive the valuable instruction of each month's Relief Society Magazine is in a handsomely bound cover.

So a Child Whe Grew Dorothy J]. Roberts Tonight there is no place to turn In thought for solace or for rest. All the things I would forget, Now the mind remembers best. There is no roadway of return To bring you back through time and place, No way to pare the change of years, To fill the need gone from your face. Time tore your simple wants aside, The little needs your eyes confessed. Now though I long, the vanished years Refuse you what my heart possessed. This night is one to bear the scourge, The whiplash of an old regret, Until the wanted grace is learned, Until the waning moon has set; Till day brings other seeking eyes, And other fingers that implore, A chance to change the stone for bread, To serve it through love's open door.

Keep the children's overshoes and mittens handy and also out of the way by making good use of that multiple skirt hanger. Simply cover an area of your back porch or basement wall with clear plastic to protect the paint from mud and water. Next, hang the skirt hanger on a good heavy screw eye inserted in the wall. Clip mittens at the top (in pairs snapped together) and overshoes at the bottom. Large family? Use more than one hanger. Small family? Try clipping hats and scarves where they can easily be found. When summer rolls around, use your hanger for garden gloves and swim caps. Plastic bags can substitute for overshoes ina pinch. Put the bag over your child's foot and hold tight with an elastic at the ankle. Slip a glass marble in the finger of those holey gloves for easier mending.
