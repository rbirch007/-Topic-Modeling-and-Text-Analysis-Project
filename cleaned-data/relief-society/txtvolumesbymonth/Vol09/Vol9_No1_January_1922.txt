Greeting In this eightieth year of the Relief Society, we offer hearty congratulations, love, and sincere good wishes, to the members of the organization throughout the world, and rejoice in the great good which has been accomplished. If the eighteen original members of the Society, who met and started the work on that memorable 17th of March, 1842, could speak, and if all those faithful workers who followed these early pioneers could speak, we feel sure that they, too, one and all, would rejoice with us in the accomplishments and labors of our great Society. Our hearts are filled with gratitude and thanksgiving to our heavenly Father, not only for his mercy, his guidance and his help, but for the success of the work itself, and for the privileges and opportunities he has given to the women of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We are grateful and thankful to all who have contributed to the Relief Society cause; to the general, stake, and local Priesthood, who have given us guidance and loyal support; to the members of the General Board for their untiring efforts and helpful suggestions in our councils, and for their labors in visiting all the stakes in conventions and conferences, which they have recently accomplished, alnd which they did willingly and cheerfully; to the stake officers and board members for their unceasing labors and hearty support; to the ward officers and teachers who are in immediate charge of the real work of the organization and who make constant and daily personal sacrifice in the cause; to the devoted and faithful members themselves, the real Relief Society workers, who make the organization itself possible. We thank you one and all, and pray that God will bless and strengthen and support you at all times. And now, in this new year, let us go onward and upward; let us cherish the ideals and standards of the past, but let us go forwvard with our faces to the rising sun, with the faith and hope that the Lord will direct us and help us to fit our labors to meet the present and future needs of the organization.

THE Relief Society Magazine Vol. IX. JANUARY, 1922 No. 1. Presiding Patriarchs of the Church Susa Young Gates. Patriarchs are spoken of in the holy scriptures as evangelists, which is attested by the remarks of. The Prophet Joseph Smith, delivered June 27, 1839: An Evangelist is a Patriarch, even the oldest man of the blood of Joseph, or of the seed of Abraham. Wherever the Church of Christ is established in the earth, there should be a patriarch for the benefit of the posterity of the Saints, as it was with Jacob in giving his patriarchal blessings unto his sons, The tremendous task of organizing the Church with offices and functions, which was undertaken by the Prophet Joseph Smith, could never have been accomplished, in centuries of time, without constant revelations of the Lord Jesus Christ. Dr. John Dewey, a great philosopher, who studied our organization, once said, that this Church possessed the most perfectly organized machinery of anything known upon earth, except that of the German army. The German army was the most perfect man-made organization of modern times. This Church is divinely organized, and is illumined, day by day, by the spirit of life and the voice of inspiration. Were it not for the revelations by which this Church was organized and the light which guides it daily, it would fall to pieces by the same forces which destroyed the army of the German Emperor. The study of our organization is both profound and deeply interesting. Contemplating the Church as a whole, with its general and local authorities, its temples, its auxiliary societies. Its missionary and educational systems, one is lost in wonder and admiration at the simplicity, and yet the exactitude, the completeness, of the whole plan; and yet the individual liberty which is encompassed by this divine plan makes it per- 4 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE fect in detail and in execution. How inadequate it all would have been, however, if there had been no evangelist whose duty it is to pronounce, under the authority of the Priesthood, and by the inspiration of the Lord, the past, present and future conditions of those who apply for blessings under the hands of the man thus duly authorized. There, is something in the human heart which craves an individual knowledge of his past, an explanation of his present, and a light as to his future. That craving has been sometimes gratified, in the ancient past, by astrologers, witches, and sooth-sayers. Today that longing is met and answered in the same mistaken, if not evil way, by spiritualists, who deceive many and wha sometimes garb themselves in the robes of so-called scientific research. For the Latter-day-Saint who wishes this prized information, we have always in convenient nearness to our homes in wards and stakes, an evangelist or patriarch, who is willing and able to throw the light of truth upon our pathway. The office of Presiding Patriarch descends from father to son as it did anciently. It is interesting to note the following points concerning this priestly office, as made known through the blessing conferred upon the head of Patriarch Hyrum Smith by his father, Joseph Smith, Senior. My son Hyrum, I seal upon your head your Patriarchal blessing which I placed upon your head before, for that shall be verified. In addition to this, I now give you my dying blessing. You shall have a season of peace, so that you shall have a sufficient rest to accomplish the work which God has given you to do. You shall be as firm as the pillars of heaven unto the end of your days. I now seal upon your head the Patriarchal power, and you shall bless the people. This is my dying blessing upon your head in the name of Jesus. Amen, In section 124 of the Doc. & Cov., the Lord explains th" power and authority of the patriarch. 'Whoever he blesses shall be blessed, and whoever he curses shall be cursed." (v. 93); "Whatsoever he shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever he shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven." We find the following in the Doctrine and Covenant Commentary: In addition to the Patriarchal Priesthood which was conferred upon Hyrum Smith, he received another great and special blessing, for the Lord called him to be a "prophet, and a seer, and a revelator unto to my Church, as well as my servant Joseph" (v. 94), and to him was transferred "the blessing and glory and honor and Priest- PRESIDING PATRIARCHS 5 hood and gifts of the Priesthood," that once were given to Oliver Cowdery who stood as the "second Elder of the Church, holding the keys with the Prophet, before he (Oliver) transgressed. All these blessings were given to Hyrum Smith who, by this special calling, in addition to becoming the Patriarch of the Church, also became a President of the Church, holding the keys of the kingdom in conjunction with his brother Joseph. Moreover, he was given the promise that his name should be had in "honorable remembrance from generation to generation for ever and ever." (vs. 90.) How literally this has been fulfilled. No doubt, all of our thousands of readers have long ago received their Patriarchal blessings, under the hands of the patriarch in their local wards or stakes; or even by the Presiding Patriarch of the Church. It certainly is a duty as well as a privilege, and should not be neglected by any who lay claim to being Latter-day-Saints. The present incumbent of this exalted office, Patriarch Hyrum G. Smith, is filled with the spirit of his office. Many incidents might be related which are really awe-inspiring in their application and evidence of revelation. One remarkable incident occurred when a young girl came into his office for a blessing on her birthday, about a year ago. She was the fifth generation of Latter-day-Saint women, in the Church, and wa* not at that time very serious-minded or devoted to Church labors; but in the blessing given her, the patriarch promised her that she should go upon a mission and there proclaim the gospel with joy to those who would hear her message. Today that young girl is on a mission, and is one of the happiest girls in the Church, although she marveled at the promise made, for a mission was far from her thoughts at the time the blessing was given. The following article which has been kindly furnished by Patriarch Hyrum G. Smith is full of interesting and valuable suggestions: PRESIDING PATRIARCHS OF THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY-SAINTS. Hyrum Gibbs Smith. The 'office of the Presiding Patriarch is a very important and high calling in the Church; it is the only office which descends according to lineage, Doctrine and Covenants, Section 107, verses 40-41, except the office of Bishop, and up to the present time no literal descendant of Aaron has been desig- 6 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE nated. It is an office of Priesthood—the same that was given to Father Adam—and is handed down in the same manner now as it was in the days of Michael, the great Prince. The first man in this dispensation to receive this important calling was Joseph Smith, Sr., father of the Prophet Joseph. This ordination took place December 18, 1833, at the Smith home, under the hands of Joseph, the Prophet, who had received the Priesthood from those who held it in former dispensations. Before his death, which was September 14, 1840, he blessed his oldest living son, Hyrum, to succeed him. And in a revelation given to the Prophet Joseph on the 19th of January, 1841, the Lord made known the order of this office, and called Hyrum out of the First Presidency to be the Patriarch; and called William Law to act as Counselor to the Prophet in Hyrum's stead. This revelation, Section 124, verses 91-95 and 123-124, makes the calling and duties of the Presiding Patriarch, plain. Hyrum, therefore, succeeded his father by ordination and by birthright. He fell a martyr with the Prophet, at Carthage, June 27, 1844, leaving the office of Patriarch in the Church vacant. William Smith, a brother to Joseph and Hyrum, was ordained a Patriarch but was not sustained at any conference as Presiding Patriarch. He was excommunicated from the Church, October 12, 1845. The office descended to an uncle of the Prophet's, Asahel Smith, who was ordained a patriarch by the Twelve, October 7, 1844. Asahel did not enjoy good health and was not very active in the office and died in Iowa, July 20, 1848. Another uncle had been a patriarch, ordained by the Prophet, January 10, 1844, a younger brother to Asahel, John Smith, grandfather to President Clarissa Smith Williams. He was called to the office of Presiding Patriarch, by President Brigham Young, in Salt Lake Valley, January 1, 1849. He was faithful and active; by many of the pioneers he was known as "Father John Smith," and to many others as "Uncle John," because he was the Prophet's uncle. He was a close friend to President Young, and was left to preside over the Church here in the Valley, from September, 1847, to October, 1848, while President Young emigrated the Saints through the mountains. From his records we learn that during the five years in this office he gave upwards of 5,000 blessings; and died May 23, 1854. From May 23, 1854, until February 18, 1855, the office was vacant again. John Smith, the oldest son of the martyred Hyrum, was now called and ordained to the office, which was his right, the same as it was the right of his father. Until now, he had PRESIDING PATRIARCHS 7 not been called, because of his youth, having not reached his twenty-third birthday when ordained. He was born September 22, 1832. During the fifty-six years he served the Church as Presiding Patriarch, he traveled among the people from ward to ward, and was instrumental in administering nearly twentyone thousand recorded blessings, and enjoyed to a high degree the spirit of his office and calling. He was an older brother of the late President Joseph F. Smith, being six years his senior, and son of the first wife, Jerusha Barden, while President Smith, was a son of Mary Fielding, both sons of the martyred patriarch, Hyrum. Joha Smith died at his home in Salt Lake City, November, 6, 1911. At the following April conference, the present incumbent, Hyrum G. Smith, a grandson of the late John Smith, was sustained to succeed him in the office of Presiding Patriarch of the Church. He was in California at the time, presiding over the Los Angeles branch of the Church. He was ordained and set apart to the high office which he holds, on May 9, 1912, under the hands of President Joseph F. Smith, and the members of the Council of the Twelve who were present. Up to the present time he has administered 8,775 recorded blessings. 'There are in the stakes of Zion about two hundred and fifteen patriarchs, men who have been chosen, called, and ordained, because of their worth and faithfulness. It is their duty to act in their callings in the stakes where they have been set apart to minister. It is the privilege of every worthy member of the Church to receive a patriarchal blessing; and many who are tried with the labors and ills of this life have received comfort other than their patriarchal blessing, at the hands of the patriarchs in the Church. Many who have been bowed down in grief and sorrow, and many who have been tried with Jjoubt, have been revived and renewed in faith, and given a new hope in life by reading and re-reading their recorded blessings. The Beacon Light, Manchester, England, says of Charlie Chaplin, who visited England in the summer of 1921: He does not smoke and is a teetotaller. He keeps fit by visits to the gymnasium, the swimming pool, and the raquet courts." Reminiscences of the Granddaughter of Hyrum Smith Written by Nellie Stary Bean JERUSHA WALKER BLANCHARD "You want me to tell you a story of pioneer days, dearie? Why, Til be glad to do it." I sat down eagerly to hear the tale. "First, I'll tell you all my family history, then some interesting things about my childhood. As you know, I'm the oldest grand-daughter of Hyrum Smith, the martyred patriarch. My mother's name was Lovina Smith; and the memories of her sisters, Jerusha and Sarah, with Uncle John Smith, are dear to me now. How I loved my dear Uncle John Smith, the Patriarch, who always met me with a smile and a kiss! A G "The Prophet Joseph and Aunt abot 2) Emma were very fond of children and so, besides their own family of four boys and one adopted daughter, Julia, who married John R. Murdock, they reared my father, Loren Walker, and his sister, Lucy Walker. Father and mother were playmates together, grew to manhood and womanhood and finally married. My mother was very young to marry, but both the Patriarch Hyrum, her father, and the Prophet Joseph, her uncle, felt that their time was near at hand and they desired that Lovina should have a male protector as her mother had died some years before. At the time of my grandmother Jerusha Bardon Smith's death my grandfather, Hyrum, was on a mission. In due time therefore he brought Mary Fielding Smith home to brighten his life and to care for his motherless children, and she was the mother of the late Joseph Fielding Smith, and Martha A. Smith Harris. "On the 23rd of June, 1844, my father and mother, Loren Walker and Lovina Smith were married by the justice of the peace. Some time later, they received their endowments and were married in the Nauvoo temple; only four days later than the marriage, on the 27th of June, Joseph and Hyrum were martyred in Carthage jail. "On July 6, 1849, I came to their home and received the name of Jerusha Walker. When I was three years old we moved GRANDDAUGHTER OF HYRUM SMITH 9 from Nauvoo to Macedonia, Hancock county, and lived there ' three or four years. Often times Aunt Emma would send for us in the carriage and we would drive to her home to spend a few days with her and with great-grandmother, Lucy Mack Smith, who was a little old lady suffering from rheumatism. "What fun we had with Aunt Emma's boys, Joseph, Frederick, Alexander and David. How we raced through the house playing hide and seek. My favorite hiding place was in an old wardrobe which contained the mummies, and it was in here that I would creep while the others searched the house. There were three mummies: The old Egyptian king, the queen and their daughter. The bodies were wrapped in seven layers of linen cut in thin strips. In the arms of the Old King, lay the roll of papyrus from which our prophet translated the Book of Abraham. "After leaving Macedonia we moved to Iowa City where I well remember seeing the first handcart company leave for the Valleys of the Mountains, It was here that we received news of my grandmother, Lucy Mack Smith's, death. She nearly reached the century mark and she was glad to rest. "While at Iowa City my uncle, William Walker, had charge of all the cattle of the immigrants and also the wagons; so we moved on to Florence, Nebraska, or Winter-quarters, as it was called, passing on the journey many graves of faithful Saints who had failed to reach their goal. Father located us down on the Missouri bottom where the feed was plentiful for the cattle. Father and Uncle William cut and stacked the hay for winter. After this was completed they built our house. Two rows of poles parallel to each other and about two feet apart were driven in the ground and willows were woven in and out, forming a double wall. The space between was filled with dirt and the roof was also of willows and dirt. Just a few feet from our door was a deep ravine with a tiny stream flowing along the bottom. This stood us in very good stead, one time, and this is the way it happened: "One day the stage coach was passing along, and a man carelessly tossed his cigarette away and passed on, little thinking of the damage he had done. Soon the dry grass blazed and we were in the midst of a terrible prairie fire. The grass was nearly as tall as the willows and burned like chaff. Flames pursued flames and came together with a clap like thunder. Father hurried us down to the little creek and placed us under the over-hanging bank with wet quilts protecting us from the heat. The flames sped on and reached the very banks of the creek, sparks fell to the other side and the demon fire sped on. All winter it smoldered in the grass and willows along that river. Oh! Dearie me, how careless some folks are. 10 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE "In 1857, Uncle John Smith who had acted as a scout across the plains, came for my mother and they went back to visit Aunt - Emma. What a dear, sweet woman she was, and though she made serious mistakes, yet how many of us, if placed in her position, would have done any better? None of her children, and only one granddaughter, remained true to the faith. "In 1860, we started for the Land of Promise with fifteen or twenty wagons. Karl G. Maeser, with his wife and sister-inlaw, were in our company. Of course, we had some minor troubles, such as stampedes and Indian scares, but only two serious accidents marred our journey. My sister fell from the wagon and sustained injuries which caused her to be a cripple all her life. My brother was accidentally shot in the arm, and it was necessary for my mother, Uncle John and Dr. John Hershey, to proceed to Salt Lake without the rest of the company. We arrived in two weeks after leaving the Ferry on Green river, where the accident occurred; my brother was able to greet us as we arrived. "Did I see any hardships? Oh, yes; many times the grasshoppers were so thick as to hide the sun, and the Indians were often troublesome. We were trained in the school of hard experience and we had few hours for play. But what of the gay times I have had at our parties? With home-made shoes, a dress made from wool carded by father, or perhaps a calico gown, I felt like a queen; and when we sat down to a dinner of whole roasted pig and service-berry sauce, my heart overflowed with happiness. Perhaps my sparkling eyes attracted Brother Blanchard, for it wasn't long until I answered 'yes.' We are the proud parents of eleven children, and twenty-eight greatgrandchildren, and forty-two grandchildren. Ah! They are good children and love their mother, which repays any privation I may have suffered as a pioneer. What a glorious gospel, dear Uncle Joseph. Proclaimed to the world, and how thankful I am to be a member of the Relief Society, in Le Grande ward, Union stake, where I hope to work for my own and others' welfare." The September issue of Good Health contains this significant statement: "The prodigious efforts made by the tobacco companies to increase their sales in order to heap up riches for themselves, have awakened people everywhere to an appreciation of the fact that the tobacco evil is a menace to human welfare which can no longer be disregarded. It is interesting to note that the President of the United States, in a recent interview, announced himself as opposed to the tobacco habit. Alieaggh he is known to be a smoker, he no doubt regrets the act. Bubbles and Troubles Ruth Moench Bell Klickity! Klackity! Klack! Klack! Went the electric washing machine. The tea-kettle and boiler sang vigorous accompaniments. The baby, baffled in some cherished plan, bawled vociferously! Ralph and Ruth, too near an age to agree, were quarreling in high-pitched voices! Marjory, the eldest, was shouting questions at her mother in an attempt to be heard above the uproar. And the mother! Nothing jazzed across her nerves like noise. Disorder and confusion. And she had all three. Steamheated within and without, with two distracted lines between her nose and several more across her forehead, she yearned to fly from the whole scene and never glance back. The postman's whistle, always with romantic possibilities for most, scarcely stirred the mother who expected nothing different from the hum-drum monotony of her daily life. Marjory answered the door. She came back with eyes dancing: "Oh, it's a Christmas parcel from Aunt Ethel!" Marjory exclaimed. Mrs. Collins' frown deepened. That meant a suitable return must be made from their scant means. "Open it, Mamma, open it!" Ralph and Ruth, agreeing for one instant, danced up and down. "But it is marked 'to be opened Christmas morning!' " Mrs. Collins protested. "Open it now!" Marjory suggested. "And then open it again on Christmas! Come on, Mamma, Aunt Ethel will never know." Disregarding the solemn admonition: "To be opened Christmas morning," Mrs. Collins, without enthusiasm, undid the ribbons. She must know the extent her coins must reach in the return gift. Eager for something beautiful, and forgetting in their childish anticipation that Aunt Ethel's Christmas presents for several years had been "dark, dreary, drudge aprons," as Marjory dubbed them, the children in breathless delight crowded around. Then a sudden chorus of Oh's, and Ah's of joy broke out, when Mrs. Collins, with puzzled fingers held up an exquisite trifle of Georgette crepe, lace 12 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE and ribbons, frilly and fragile and daintily perfumed, as fairy-like a boudoir cap as ever graced Milady's tresses. "For me?" the mother questioned. The card confirmed it: "To my darling sister, Edith, with love from Ethel." From the prosaic realities of a middle-aged present to the rosy dreams of a girlish past, this magic trifle of lace and ribbons, lifted her easily over the wide stretch of years. They had dreamed together, Ethel and Edith, of rose-colored boudoirs, silken negligees, maids and boudoir caps, velvety carpets and delicate ivory; and Ethel's dreams had come true. Yet never before in all these years, had she remembered that Edith, too, had dreamed. Lavender, too, so becoming to Edith's golden tresses. "Try it on, Mamma! Try it on!" "Oh, it wouldn't look well with my hair dressed like this, and this awful sweater on." "Oh, yes it will! Yes, it will!" Mrs. Collins removed her son's sweater cap and slipped the boudoir cap over her hair. "Oh, Mamma, you look lovely!" The children exclaimed dancing about her. Edith Collins stole a pleased glance into the mirror. Her weary expression had lifted, her dull eyes were sparkling. Such was the magic of the frilly thing. "Put it on tonight when papa comes home," the children urged. "But what could I wear with it?" "Your party dress." "Oh, that wouldn't do."; "Oh, Mamma, get you something pretty to wear with it and put it on at night when papa comes." "How lovely of Aunt Ethel to send it," Marjory exclaimed. No one could be insensible to its beauty and daintiness, least of all Marjory who was at the age when young girls most dote on beauty. "But what could she mean?' Mrs. Collins was still puzzled. "She knows I sit up in bed and dress my hair first thing in the morning before I get up." "Yes, and without any mirror," Marjory lamented, "and it is such pretty hair." "And I never have time to lounge around; even if I am too ill to sit up. What could she mean? If she had put the money into something! Could wear on the street it would have been more sensible." Mrs. Collins resumed her washing. While Marjory ram- BUBBLES AND TROUBLES 13 bled on over the bluing operation, the mother over the starching process, recalled bits of the past. She could see herself and twin sister, Ethel, planning their futures. "T shall marry a rich man," Ethel had always announced, "so I won't have to work and can have pretty things." "T want nice things, too," Edith had maintained. "But I am willing to work. And I want a real home with a garden and a cow and orchard and chickens and lots of room for the children to play in. I want many children." _ "Just one for me," Ethel had interposed. "I want a little girl I can dress all fluffy and pretty in laces and ribbons. But I dont want to stay in one place all the time. I want to spend my winters in California and have rich friends and maids and jewels." "T want nice things, too," Edith always reiterated yet with a resignation as if she had already renounced them as her sister's rightful prerogative. > Both sister's dreams had come true. Though one had sunk into sordid drudgery and the other had cradled herself in selfish luxury. "Tt suppose Ethel remembers that J, too, longed for little luxuries,' Edith Collins said to herself as she starched the clothes. "It certainly was lovely of her to remember me with something beautiful as she would send one of her wealthiest friends. I must write and thank her at once, even if I do have to confess that I opened the parcel too soon. She has so many rich friends she might have sent it to. I must try to find time to please the children and get a little pleasure and beauty into our lives." Mrs. Collins hurried through with the rest of the washing and then wrote a grateful letter, reminiscent of girlhood days, to her sister. And such consternation as the letter produced in the Leslie household. "Rhea, come here," Ethel Leslie called. Her one wishedfor daughter came down stairs smiling demurely. "My mischief hath overtaken me," she murmured amusedly to herself. "The shadow of Nemesis is on my trail." "Coming, Mater," she called blithely, as if she were blissfully unconscious of the impending storm. "However did you come to make such a blunder?" the mother chided. "I might have known I couldn't trust you to get the Christmas presents off without making some dreadful mistake. You couldn't possibly have made a worse blunder than to have sent Aunt Edith's hideous kitchen 4 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE apron to Amelie DuPont and the exquisite boudoir cap I meant for her to your Aunt Edith who couldn't possibly have any use for it or appreciation, for that matter." Rhea turned toward the window. She was hoping her mother would think her attitude one of deep penitence. The truth was she dared not trust her face nor her voice at that moment. The image of the haughty Amelie DuPont taking that "serviceable" kitchen apron from its brown wrappings 'was too much foor her sense of humor. "T believe you did it on purpose," Mrs. Leslie declared. "And I suppose you think it very funny. I shall sit right down and apologize to Amelie for your blunder and tell her to return the parcel unopened. I must write to Edith at once, too, and tell her to get the cap right off to Amelie's address." Rhea was thereby galvanized into action. "Oh, mother, no. Don't write to Aunt that way. It would break her heart. Don't let her know that you value her so far below that horrid divorced French woman, who can't even pronounce her name plain Amelia, though she was born right here in America. Why mother, Aunt Edith and you were girls together, think what good times you must have had dreaming together. I never had a sister to confide in. That silly French woman and her smart set you have only met at the beach a few times. And she is a perfect cat and I hate her." "Then you did do it on purpose. I suspected as much," the mother answered icily, "I shall write to Edith for its return just to punish you." Rhea thought swiftly. There was no doubt that her mother, in that mood, would write to Aunt Edith, explain the mistake and ask her to forward the cap, carefully wrapped, to the "person for whom it was intended." Rhea could hear the tones of her mother's voice as she would have said it. And she could see just how cruel it would appear on paper. Rhea glanced down at her Aunt Edith's letter, full of the tender memories the cap had evoked. "I am sorry now I did it," she thought to herself. And then occurred to her a possible way out without hurting Aunt Edith. "T suppose I ought to write the letters, mother," Rhea observed contritely. "It was I who made the mistake. They would never understand how you could make such a blunder. Every one expects a rattle-headed girl of seventeen to do almost anything like mixing Christmas presents and other cheap movie tricks." BUBBLES AND TROUBLES 15 "Perhaps it would be better," Mrs Leslie agreed, glad to escape the unpleasant task. She yielded, however, not without suspicion of her daughter's motives. Rhea was always a puzzlle to her mother and particularly dangerous when she seemed most demure. How anyone could feel as Rhea did about the select social functions given at the Leslie home, was surely bewildering. Gotten up like a French doll, Rhea flitted in and out among the guests, bestowing napkins or bearing cakes or hot rolls, the most benign expression on her face. And in her heart the queerest contradictions one could imagine. "I wanted to shower all the hot rolls into Mrs. Bixby's pink satin lap," was her observation after one occasion, "babbling away about, Isn't she sweet? Isn't she just too cunning! And she says those things just to flatter you. They all do when they know very well that I have a hook nose, a mole as big as a molasses cookie right near my 'adorable little mouth.' "On the way home they say to each other: 'Such a forward minx as that child is. I don't see, for the life of me, why Ethel Leslie allows her to be about.' 'Yes, isn't she pert and saucy? And that nose, my dear!' 'And that awful mole! I suppose she will take her to a specialist at the beach some day, and see what they can do with her. They could probably operate on her nose and take the mole off with the electric needle, poor child.' 'And I've heard she is perfectly crazy about the movies!" 'Mrs. Leslie, remembering such observations, took a second look at Rhea's composed features. If she could only guess what was going on in the girl's thinking plant so she might take measures to circumvent her once in a while. "Let me see both letters before you send them," she observed. "All right, Mumsie," Rhea cried, trying to keep the relief out of her voice. "Dearest Auntie: (The first note ran.) "By a silly mistake I sent you that foolish boudoir cap Mumsie meant for a frivolous woman who lolls about all day in such things. Your customary, dandy, big apron I sent to the useless creature who will probably wonder what it is. Please wrap the absurd cap with the most painful pains and address it to the enclosed name and number. Am sending a Christmas card to go along with it. "Your day-dreaming niece, "RHEA." "P S. How is Mugs?" (which was Rhea's pet name for Mar- 16 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE jory.) "I'm coming up some day for a visit, if you can put up with me." "R.. L." Rhea presented the letter while her mother was abstractedly powdering her nose: "Is it all right, Mumsie dear?" "Rather jazzy! But I guess it will be the best way to avoid offending her." "All right, Mumsie, I'll make the one to Mrs. Amelie DuPont as stiff and formal as wedding-cake icing." "T'll have to leave it to you. I'm late for Mrs. Crane's tea as it is. And Mrs. Leslie presented her cheek for Rhea to 'peck at,' as Rhea characterized the kind of kiss she was supposed to inflict. Embraces were taboo. They had been known to disarrange Mamma's frock. "Br-r-r! That new rouge tastes awful!' Rhea shuddered as she placed the letter near her papa's newspaper and skipped out, well knowing what she was doing and what the consequences would be. Very soon her papa would saunter in for his paper. The letter was temptingly open and affectionately near the paper. Even a casual observer would see the paper first. Rhea's papa was anything but a casual observer. Witness the wealth he had "casually" observed and accumulated. Rhea wrote in a firm, bold, boyish hand. Each word easily decipherable at some distance. It was a safe venture that her father would glance at that letter. One glance would surely lead to another. Rhea-knew her father. He was a man of action. Soon he would call—! Whew. He had found it already! He was calling her now in sternest accents. "Rhea, come here!" Rhea went, hugging herself all the way. "What does this mean," her father demanded, exactly as she knew he would. "Just what it says," Rhea replied with utmost surprise. "Mother left me to get the presents off and I mixed the two that were meant for Aunt Edith and Mrs. Amelie (Rhea never ommitted the accent) DuPont." "Your mother is going to insult her twin sister over a fool cap? Burn that thing right away. Send another flummididdle to that DuPont woman if you must and let her send that apron back. But you get something decent off to your Aunt Edith. Send something suitable to each of the children. It would be a darn sight better for this home if your mother would put on a kitchen apron once in a while instead of playing with all these fool gimcracks." Rhea had never seen her father so severe before. It was BUBBLES AND TROUBLES 17 his first open criticism of her mother. His covert disapproval had long been guessed by his daughter. "Don't you want to run up there for a few days of sane living before you are packed off to the coast again? Your Aunt Edith always was my ideal, so quiet and contented with her family and her poverty. I haven't seen her for years. But I've always wanted to run up there for a few days and do something for them and get away from all the tumult of this home. Lodging house, I should have said. Get ready and go up before the holidays. A few days in a real home with children and real people ought to give you something fine to contrast with that hot-house atmosphere of divorced women and idle, scheming men, you will have to live in on the beach. Lovely place for a young girl, I should say! I should think she was 'giving you a chance!' " Rhea stared at her father, ordinarily so silent. His words filled her with a vague forboding she could not, dared not define. Disrupted home! Disrupted home! The words sailed into her brain from somewhere and would not flit out. "T'd like to go," she said finally. "I haven't seen Mugs since we were in pinafores. But I don't want to leave you, daddy. We'll be going again so soon. And we always stay so long." "Never mind me," he answered shortly, "Your mother and I need to talk things over." Rhea dispatched a formal note to Mrs. DuPont. She also mailed, at the same time, a violet negligee with lavender hose and slippers, the very match of the bewitching lavender cap, to her Aunt Edith. The gift she selected for Mrs. DuPont had not taken half the loving thought and care. "I can just see Aunt Edith, so sweet and contented resting beautifully, so adorned that husband and children would adore her." A note that went with this festal array and the gifts for the children ran: "Dearest Aunt Edith: Mother was delighted that you admired the cap. She has always wanted to send you something pretty but was fearful that you might not wish her to do so. Your letter emboldens her to send the violet negligee, slippers and hose that belong with the cap. I'd love to drop in some time and see you all comfy, in a great lounging chair by the fire, while Mugs and I make the piano sing or while we play games or read and pop corn and munch apples. "Love to Mugs, "Your Niece, "RHEA." (To be continued.) Disarmament Conference Delegations At the Disarmament Conference, which met in Washington on November 12, 1921, only four nations appear as vital factors—the United States, Great Britain, France and Japan. Another of the European great powers, Italy, takes an uncertain "me too". Position, willing, hesitatingly, to assent to whatever the others may agree upon. China is an element in the Far East discussion, but further than in a platonic sense cuts little figure. In this situation, the personnel of the delegations from the four principal nations affords a key to the probable results which may follow. Secretary of State Charles E. Hughes together with three other noted Americans represent the United States; /besides these are a number of advisers of no less ability than the chiefs, and equally influential in determining the American policy. Mr. Hughes drew much public praise from his primal action indicating what the United States was willing to do in reducing naval armament, his proposal also affecting Great Britain and Japan. This particular feature was worked out before the meeting of the conference, and is not a one-man idea. Mr. Hughes is a commanding figure in the conference, by reason of the standing of the nation he represents. His influence with the smaller nations will be determined largely by his personality, as will be that of his associates, some of whom may excel him in particular features, as he excels them in others. He is an able lawyer, self-confident and occasionally impetuous, with a thorough understanding of the American view of diplomatic questions. In the event of a dilemma, he can keep his constituency out of difficulty, but in the adjustment of troubles among other factions it may be different. As to the United States, the conference will result in marked industrial benefit, in reducing the enormous expense of a big naval and military establishment. Admiral Kato of the Japanese delegation knows how to keep his lips closed in the presence of foreigners, but consults freely with his associates. The Japanese diplomat never is satisfied with glancing at two sides of a square post from an angle; he looks carefully at all four surfaces, then looks again and again. Years ago Japan was caught in a trap by occidental diplomats, and the Jap feels that then it was their fault; if he is caught again, he understands it will be his fault. Other races may think him inferior, but he does not. It is said the oriental DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE DELEGATION 19 PAN-AMERICAN UNION BUILDING WHERE COMMITTEE CONFERENCES ARE HELD mind does not operate the same as the occidental mind; and this is especially true as to the Japanese. Where the Jap must yield to other nations, he does so with the utmost complacency, but always with a mental reservation favoring Japan. He scrupulously keeps his word, but the interpretation of that word is subject to differences of opinion. A third of a century study of Japanese character, convinces one that Japan will not be worsted in the diplomatic encounter, and probably will come off victor in convincing the world that she does not want to fight the United States but must have free commercial ingress to China and Siberia, which in the end means Japanese domination—the identical features to which America objects when applied to the Pacific Coast States. Next comes France. Her chief representative, Premier Aristide Briand, is more than a brilliant Frenchman. He is keen, deliberative, and vigorous and decisive in action. When he takes a stand it is difficult to move him. In both the retrospective and prospective view of history and diplomacy, to him France stands foremost. In his mental vision of a scene, if there are boys standing around with cobblestones in their hands, it is to throw at France. Nationally, he is not cosmopolitan. There is only one French-speaking nation, and M. Briand thinks only in French and for France. He knows the history of Europe for the past fifteen centuries, and in that record cannot discover any great European power as the permanent friend of France, hence trusts none of them. His is just the nature that would "throw a monkey wrench into the machinery" of a world 20 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE agreement that does not accord with his view of preference to France. Britain's chief representative at the conference opening, Arthur J. Balfour, deserves a large share of credit for the success of the British premier, David Lloyd George, in handling his nation's affairs. Mr. Balfour was the real force in the additional acquirement of territory by Britain through the treaty of Versailles. He has a deep conviction favoring the establishing of the house of Judah in Palestine. While not possessing 'the same youthful physical vivacity that marked his appearance in his late thirties, he is the same clearheaded, courteous, careful-speaking, highly-educated Englishman—the type which insists on giving and receiving fair play. Gentle in manners but resolu'e in deed, none who have direct dealings with him have DAUGHTERS OF THE REVOLUTION BUILDING WHERE THE PLENARY SESSIONS OF THE CONFERENCE ARE HELD reason to mistake the meaning of his words or to doubt his sincerity. He does not recognize the superiority of either the Frenchman or the Jap, and sometimes is impatient with that claim by these. Possessing an unusually clear and keen foresight, for thirty years he has talked of and looked for a close brotherly relation between the two great English-speaking nations, and implicitly believes therein. Unlike the Japanese and French representatives, he takes a cosmopolitan view of world affairs; and since Great Britain is made up of many nations and America of many nationalities, he coincides with the American view, and is even quicker than we in putting it into practice. DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE DELEGATION 21 Utah's position in reducing the armament expense of the United States, and incidentally that of any other nation which follows, cannot be overlooked. The United States Senate ultimately passes upon questions involved in the conference. Senator Reed Smoot, whose personal integrity and financial acumen have brought him to the pinnacle of influence, already has indicated, in his official action, the economy that must be practiced, and therefore has been a potent factor in fixing the American policy of essential limitation of armament. Former Senator George Sutherland's strong influence as one of America's leading constitutional lawyers, and chairman of the advisory committee to the American delegation, is being directed to the same end. A third Utah man, whose national prominence as an international Jawyer brings Utah to the front, is J. Reuben Clark; his ability and store of information as to the Far East problem and limitation of armaments having led to his selection as a special adviser on these and kindred subjects. That the task ahead of the conference is beset with difficulties in accomplishment is no secret to Mr. Clark, who realizes in his important duties that a harmonious association of nations with divergent interests, like a peaceful union of discordant religious sects, requires more than human wisdom for attainment. But even in the present circumstances, Utah rests assured that with the three notable leaders named, her obligations on the great thought now before the nations will not go unfulfilled. Much has been already accomplished while more and equally important results may be looked for in the future as the result of this great ConWie teks an ee a cm MCT PATIO OF PAN-AMERICAN UNION BUILDING 22 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE ference. The initial bomb thrown into this Conference was projected in our balliwick by our own administration and bids fair to be the precursor of similar creative displays. The fact that we have four women to speak for us in Washington at this Conference is both significant and auspicious. They are Katherine Philips Edson a representative of suffrage workers on Advisory Committee, who helped win the vote for the women of California and who is a member of the California Industrial Welfare Commission and has been notably successful in arbitrating labor troubles; Mrs. Charles Sumner Bird, a lifelong suffrage worker, chairman of the State Suffrage Association, when Massachusetts ratified the 19th Amendment, now serving as chairman of the League's Disarmament Committee, took with her to Washington resolutions signed by all leading Massachusetts women's organizations, pledging their support in the effort to secure disarmament; Mrs. Thomas G. Winter, universally known as president of the General Federation of Women's Clubs. She has the backing of two million club women, as well as other great women's organizations that are working in co-operation toward disarmament; and Eleanor Franklin Egan, a traveler and writer, who has written more about foreign countries probably than any other American woman. She and her husband edited the Manila Times. BOOK NOTICES POEMS BY JAMES L. HUGHES, _ Canada's famous poet has again placed before the public a volume of his delightful verses. In Nature's Temple Shrines, a new book by James L. Hughes; it makes its greatest appeal to childhood, being simply written and expressive of the first grave joyousness of the childheart. It reveals the greatest charm of its author—his sincere appreciation of self-less beauty. The book is fitted to cultivate a very desirable reverence in the young minds which discover it—while it will always find a warm place in the heart of grown-ups who still love God, nature and innocence. NEW STORY BY NEPHI ANDERSON, "DORIEN." One of the best and most interesting stories written by the popular home author, Nephi Anderson, has just been printed, and the story should be in every home. It breathes a pure devotion to the best in life, it holds within its pages inspirational truth on many vital subjects, and above all, it shows that the gospel of hope lingers in the spirit and genius of "Mormonism." Make it a Christmas present to your dearest and best. Notes from the Field Amy B. Lyman. Mrs. Thurza Adams, president of the Relief Society of the Samoan mission, writes that the visit to the Samoan mission last summer of Elders D. O. McKay and H. J. Cannon was a remarkable and historical event; indeed it was an advent of a lifetime for Saints, elders and strangers alike—a time of inspiration and spiritual uplift and rejoicing.. Among all the varied activities incident to conference in the two island conferences visited, no meeting was superior to the Relief Society conference. Elder McKay's inspiring discourses to the women assembled were enthusiastically received and untold good will result from them. He spoke of the aims and purposes of the work and related incidents of the devotion of Relief Society workers. In referring to the work of the women of the Bible, he said the woman best typifying the work of the Relief So- 'aye gah: Arn) Be at a APOSTLE DAVID 0. MC KAY AND ELDER HUGH J. CANNON AND THE SAMOAN RELIEF SOCIETY ciety is Dorcas. Her example was full of good works and also good deeds. She helped the poor, comforted the sick, and visited the widows and orphans. He paid tribute to the mothers who unselfishly bear and bring up children, and blessed them for their mission. He also spoke of the sanctity of the marriage vow, and urged the women to be true Latter-day Saint women. 24 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE Mrs. Adams says the Relief Society work is growing rapidly in Samoa. The accompanying picture of the Relief Socie y women assembled at the conference gives evidence of this. With the esteemed visitors, Elders McKay and Cannon and the beautiful setting of tropical trees and plants, the picture is most interesting and attractive. Oneida Stake. During the last summer, Miss Grace Gallett, of Boise, Idaho, — the Health Crusade worker of the state Anti-Tuberculosis Association, visited the county, visiting all the schools which were still open. A mass meeting in each ward was called and conducted by the ward Relief Society officers, in which Miss Gallett gave a lecture showing how parents and teachers may co-operate in teaching health habits to the children. She visited the schools, telling stories to the children about germ dragons and how the Crusade Knights may have power to kill them. A picture illustrating the story proved very effective in creating a desire in the children to become real Crusaders by doing the simple health chores required. Miss Gallett also worked with the teachers with good results, in arousing their interest in this wonderful health work. The service of Miss Gallet was secured by request of the Oneida stake Social Service Committee. Commencing June 6, 1921, a second campaign for better health was conducted by the Social Service Committees, of Oneida and Franklin stakes combined. The services of Miss Anna Esbensen, formerly the Aida county nurse, was secured from the Idaho State Anti-Tuberculosis Association. A sys-: tematic schedule was made for her visits throughout the county, The county commissioners and marshal were very kind in conveying the nurse from one ward to the other. In each ward a baby or children's clinic was held in which all children of preschool age were weighed, measured, and examined for physical defects. Nutrition classes were conducted in which 'mothers received instruction as to proper feeding of children. The physicians generously gave their services wherever possible. Throughout the county there were 724 children examined. Some follow-up work will be carried on that none of these little ones, having physical defects, may be neglected. The Oneida stake Relief Societies, led by the stake Genealogical Society, spent a day at the Logan temple. This proved to be one of the most successful excursions ever conducted in one day at the Logan temple. There were 295 Relief Society officers, members, and their husbands from the stake. Two companies were conducted through twice. All present felt the NOTES FROM THE FIELD 25 spirit of rejoicing among those whose work was done for them, as certainly as if it might have been audibly expressed. Central States Mission. The St. Joseph, Mo. Relief Society has sixteen members, who are faithful in their duties and also in attending meetings. Mrs. Rosa Hull, the president, is ably assisted by Mrs. Martha Keatley and Mrs. Sarah George, as counselors. Mrs. Lenore ST. JOSEPH, MISSOURI RELIEF SOCIETY Nielson as secretary and treasurer and Mabel Christensen as class leader. Meetings have been held regularly and the lessons as outlined in the Magazine have been greatly enjoyed. At present the menibers are engaged in making quilts, which will be sold and the funds used for relief purposes. Many families during the prevailing hard times have been helped with food and clothing and many have been impressed by the way these noble women are teaching the gospel by example as well as by precept. The Joplin, Missouri, Relief Society, which has been an energetic organization, was divided in July into two groups to be known as the Joplin branch and Webb City branch. The funds in the treasury were divided equally between the two branches. The officers of the Joplin branch are Mrs. Clara Woodworth, president; Mrs. Lillian Camp, first counselor; Mrs. 26 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE Mollie Cater, second counselor; Mrs. Susan Poole, secretary and treasurer. The Webb City officers are Mrs. Sarah Day, president; Mrs. Minnie Morgan, first counselor; Mrs. Cenia Roop, second counselor, and Mrs. Grace Jacobs, secretary and treasurer. The meetings for the fall season have begun and class teachers have been appointed in each organization to supervise the lesson work. South Sevier Stake. More than 150 relatives, and a few of those who had been her intimate friends during her lifetime, met recently in a social gathering in the South ward chapel in honor of the 102d birthday anniversary of Flora Clarinda Gleason Washburn, born at Tolland, Mass., August 2, 1819, of a splendid Colonial family. Their first American ancestor, Thomas Gleason, came from England to America in about 1636. 'Sister Washburn joined the Church in her girlhood, and gathered with the Saints and lived with the family of Uncle John Smith, the uncle of the Prophet Joseph. At Macedonia, 22 miles from Nauvoo, she is said to have been appointed the second president of a Relief Society in the Church. After the death of the Prophet Joseph, she went to live with the family of B. F. Johnson in the Mansion House, Nauvoo. When the Saints came west, she drove her own mule team to Salt Lake City. In November, 1850, she and her husband with a company of others, were called to settle Sanpete. The next day after moving to Manti, November 22, she gave birth to a baby girl, the first white child born in Sanpete county, Almeda Washburn Wingate. This daughter celebrated her golden wedding in Monroe six years ago. Sister Washburn was a teacher in the first Relief Society in Manti, and later was president, which position she held until she, with her family, moved to Monroe, in 1872, when she was elected first president of Relief Society in Monroe. Few people in our state have given such splendid unselfish service to mankind as Sister Washburn. In the early days of the settling of Sanpete Valley she divided her one large room, taking onehalf for herself and family, and giving a fourth each to two young married couples, Willardson and Scow who had just arrived from Denmark. She taught many emigrant women how to make a living in this country. She nursed the sick, fed and clothed the unfortunate, and cared for the dead, devoting her life to the service of God and her fellow men. She also did a great work in the temple. A very timely program was given on the occasion, conduct- NOTES FROM THE FIELD 27 ed by O. P. Washburn. Among the especially interesting features were: Brief history of Mrs. Washburn and her Gleason ancestors; Genealogical record and reminiscences by old acquaintances, showing that there are nearly 400 descendants of Abraham and Flora Gleason Washburn. After the program the company went into the amusement hall adjoining, where refreshments were served, after which an enjoyable social hour was spent. THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF WOMEN. Amy Brown Lyman. The biennial meeting of the National Council of Women was held in Philadelphia, November 10-16, 1921. Although the sessions covered seven days, with three sessions daily, which was an unusual period of time for the biennial, they were interesting and profitable throughout. In fact, it was the general concensus of opinion that this was one of the most interesting and educational biennials ever held. An innovation was the holding of department meetings, one whole day being devoted to a discussion of department problems. Twenty-seven out of the thirty-six national organizations affiliated with the Council were represented by duly accredited delegates, some organizations sending as high as four and six delegates. In the official roster of affiliated organizations, which are arranged according to seniority of membership, the National Woman's Relief Society and the National Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement Association stand second and third, respectively, both organizations having been charter members of the Council. They were represented by Mrs. Amy Brown Lyman of the Relief Society and Mrs. Emily Caldwell Adams of the Y. L. M. I. A. Mrs. Philip N. Moore, who has served as president of the National Council for six years, and who was re-elected for the next biennial period against her own protest, was most charming and gracious, and presided with efficiency and dignity, being master of the situation at all times. She was supported and assisted by the capable vice-presidents, Mrs. Nathaniel E. Harris, Mrs. Frances E. Burns, and Professor Marian P. Whitney. At the formal opening meeting. The delegates were welcomed by Mayor J. Hampton Moore, of Philadelphia, his charming wife, and the local chairman, Mrs. Frederick Schoff. The president responded graciously, expressing appreciation for the hearty welcome. There were greetings by letter, cablegram, and telegram, from the various National Councils of the world, from 28 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE officers and members of the International Council of Women, including a most cordial letter and greeting from Lady Aberdeen, for many years president of the International Council of Women, from the members of the President's cabinet, ambassadors of the allies, chairman of the League of Nations, and many individuals. Among the various subjects discussed, the limitation of armaments and world peace were given most consideration. Among the speakers were men and women who have made a study of national and international relations. There were also a number of women doctors and social workers who have been ovrseas, working in the grief-stricken, famine-ridden countries of the world. The descriptions of these overseas workers, of the sad condition, sorrow, and suffering prevailing in Central Europe, the Balkan districts and Asia Minor, as a result of the war, brought tears to the eyes of the listeners, and confirmed the opinion that there must never be another war. The speakers were all united in the thought that the most vital necessity in the world today is peace, and an assurance of permanent peace, also that peace can best be secured by limitation of armaments, and an association of nations. A resolution was later adopted favoring limitation of armaments, and an association of nations; also protest against the use of gas and poisonous fluids in warfare, After four years and a half spent in the Far East, one worker, a physician, concludes that the real sufferers in war are women and children, and in her opinion the voice of woman should be heard in all councils where the subject of peace or war is being considered.: A committee of representative women were appointed from the Council to attend the Armistice Day ceremonies in Washington, D. C., and to witness the burial of the unknown soldier of America. Mrs. Emily Adams, of Utah, was among the number appointed. Other matters considered were health, education, child welfare, better films, immigration, moral standards, industrial problems, etc. These subjects were first discussed in department meetings and later brought into the general session, where they were considered, and where resolutions along progressive lines were finally adopted. In connection with these subjects, the various bills before Congress relating to educational, industrial and social legislation, were discussed, and many of them indorsed, including the maternity bill, which has been passed by Congress and has since been signed by the President of the United States; the Educational Bill, providing for a Department of Education, etc. Among the resolutions upon which NOTES FROM THE FIELD 29 there was much favorable comment was one introduced by the Y. M. M. I. A. On prohibition of cigarettes. Varied and interesting were the reports of the affiliated national organizations and one was impressed with the tremendous amount of educational and welfare work being carried on by the women of America. The two Utah delegates were very proud to report the work of their respective organizations. It was unanimously decided by the Council to accept the offer of the George Washington Memorial Association of a room for national headquarters for the Council in the Victory Memorial Building which is to be a memorial to the soldiers of America from '76 to 718, the cornerstone of which was only recently laid. The cost of the room will be $5,000 and it was decided to raise the amount by soliciting life patrons at $100 each from among the present members, and memorials in memory of departed members. The room will be known as the National Council Headquarters, established as a memorial to the founders of the Council: Susan B. Anthony, May Wright Sewell, Blizabeth Cady Stanton, Frances Willard and Rachel Foster Avery. Some of the noted guests were asked to speak on the greatest problem before the world. One said limitation of armaments; another comradeship and understanding between nations; another, internationalism; and the last, diarmament and the establishment of friendly relations between nations. While it was agreed that women should take part in the world's work today, and that they should have a voice in legislation and government, there was a plea for conservatism and wisdom on the part of women, and the thought was ever before the conference that the greatest work of women is home-making and the bearing and rearing of righteous children. In a social way there were musical luncheons, teas, auto rides to Valley Forge and to Bryn Mawr College, and visits to historical places in Philadelphia. The newly elected officers for the next two years are 'as follows: sires President, Mrs. Philip North Moore. First Vice-President, Mrs. Millicent E.

But to the Relief Society lessons on Socihl Service and the better babies' campaign she paid little attention. Not because she didn't have babies, nor because she knew all about them; but because she didn't have time, she thought, to be both an efficient house wife and an ideal mother, so she chose housework as her ideal and while she cleaned she scolded, and while she scolded she cleaned. Her work was all done by schedule and her meals prepared accordingly. She thought little about her babies' diet—they usun!- ly ate whatever the family ate and whenever she had time to feed them. Not even the babies' wet feet or cold fingers could often induce her to turn from her work to look after them; not unless the case was very urgent. One day little Jay came in with a gash in his forehead. It was deep and bleeding and it had taken her so long to dress the wound, that the mother was thirty-three minutes late with her work by schedule. To be sure she could let him apply the culd water clothes himself as the children very often did; after the first pangs of pain were over Jay started to unfold a little secret to his mother. He whispered something that some one had told him at school that day. Mrs. Grafton did not very often have time to listen to her children's troubles or joys but today she listened first from curiosity, then with resentment. When he had finished his stammered tale, she arose hastily and said angrily, "Jay, you must not listen to such talk, you are too young. And I do not care to have you play any more with Stanford Stanley." "But mama!" he cried, '"Stan's mother told him, and said that it was all true." "Jay, I will go over and speak to Stanley's mother about it myself, you may lie quietly here while I am gone." So saying she threw a light robe over the boy where he was lying, then she went to her own room to dress her hair and to slip on a clean stiffly-starched house dress. Her chamber window was slightly raised and the wind blew gently across the snow white spread and waved the delicate hand embroidery on the fresh clean slips. She took a last survey of the house before leaving to see that she had omitted no detail of housework. Everything was in perfect order. Her motto was, "Clean while you are still clean, and you will always be pat ae hey REFORMING MOTHER - 33. Clean." She pretty well lived up to her motto, regardless of any other neglected duty. As she neared the Stanley home she could see the mother out in the front yard, playing with the children, which was certainly an unheard of occurrence at the Grafton home. As the two neighbors met, Mrs. Stanley explained that she had left her work in the house to show the children the best way to play a new game over which they had. Been jangling.. Then Mrs. Stanley left the children, ushered her visitor into a room, passing over a floor which had been left partly mopped; glanced around with an, "I-told-you-so air, work and play can not be kept up in the same housewife's life." She sat down stiffly in an undusted chair, and then like an arrow flew straight to the point of her mission. "I do not wish to detain you, Mrs. Stanley, as I know you have plenty to do, and like the rest of us would not like to be hindered in your work. "But I came to speak to you about our boys. Your boy has been telling Jay about the mysteries of life, and I certainly do not approve of it." "And why certainly not?" Quietly asked the hostess. "Because," and her eyes flashed on the verge of anger, "because I do not care to have him told yet, he will find things out soon enough." "Yes, Mrs. Grafton, that he will, but from whom?" "Solve it out himself, I suppose, when he gets older. That's the way I did." "Yes, maybe he would and maybe he would not. But you must remember, Mrs. Grafton, that your circumstances were different from his. He goes to a public school while you were taught at home by a governess. And besides, he is a boy—but say, how was it that Stanford happened to tell Jay?" I told him not to tell any of the boys unless it was because they had a base understanding of the sacred mysteries of life." "T wonder why he told him?" "Perhaps because he was proud to be in possession of such knowledge," replied Mrs. Grafton, rising haughtily, disgust stamped on her face. "T wish you to understand and tell Stanford that ' can not let him play with Jay any more.' "Mama! Mama!" cried Jay Grafton rushing unbidden into the room, and sobbing as he fled to his mother's side. "Don't, Oh! Don't say that mama, Stan's the best one of all to me at school; and his mama helps us play games, and let's us come in and get warm when we're cold and wet, and besides mama, he'd never told me; only the other boys told me such 34 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE horrid things that Stanford called me away from them and said he'd tell me the loveliest story about it all. Just like his mama told him about the flowers, and birds, and things, and oh} mama, Stan's crying awful cause I told him what you said about us not being friends any more. And sis, she's been over here all day getting dry cause you wouldn't let her track our floor, and she broke through the ice and got wet." The boy stopped from mere exhaustion, and started to twist his cap. He looked timidly up into his mother's face. She whs looking down at him with a new light in her eyes. She saw for the first time, beneath that tear-stained face, a boy, longing for a mother's henrt, a mother's counsel and a mother's love. She looked up where Mrs. Stanley had been standing, but she was wisely working about the kitchen. The visiting mother sat down and tenderly gathered her boy into her arms; it was a wonderful moment for them both, mother and son, just as she heard a trio of noisy children came rushing in at the back door, and she heard her own little girl' s voice saying, "Please, Mrs. Stanley we've come in to play with you now, it's most awful chilly out there." Mrs. Grafton, with her son's hand in her's, walked towards the door, and with a smile on her face turned to her little daughter and said, ' "T think we have troubled Mrs. Stanley enough for today, you better all come over and play with me." Startled, inquisitive faces turned toward her, and then Jay eagerly dancing before her almost shouted, "Oh! Mama, will you really play with us in the house and let us move the chairs and things." But his little sister's face fell, "Mama doesn't know any games," she said. "But you can teach me," smiled her mother, placing a hand on her golden head. "Come, all of you, and teach me to play with you." The children suddenly roused from their dazed condition ran from the house, leaping and shouting. Mrs. Grafton turned with her hand on the knob, and with eyes full of tears smiled a grateful smile at the mother who came so nearly winning the love, and saving the moral faculties of her own children. Ea Mrs. Stanley knowingly arose, nodded, and smile bac' Vocational Guidance By Dr. John T. Miller In the lessons on Social Service, printed in the Relief Society Magazine, on page 247, of the April, 1921, issue, the need for vocational guidance is very forcefully stated in the following words: "The wise selection of a vocation and proper vocational training are among the most serious problems that confront the modern youth. They have generally received too little attention from parents, teachers and community leaders. Wise decision in these matters concerns not only the future usefulness and happiness of individuals, but also the stability and prosperity of the nation." This statement harmonizes with one made by United States Commissioner of Education, P. P. Claxton, in Bulletin No. 19, which was issued by his department, in 1918. He says: "In our complex industrial and social life it is little less wasteful to leave boys and girls without assistance and guidance in selecting their occupations and finding their employment than it would be to leave them unaided in obtaining education." There is now a general agreement regarding the needs for vocational guidance, but there is a great difference of opinion concerning the method of giving the help. The most popular method of recent years has been the "Trial and Error" method, which is recommended on page 248 of the April Relief Society Magazine. This is the method that Benjamin Franklin's father used a century and a half ago. Young Benjamin wanted to be- 'come a seaman, and his father did everything that he could to prevent this. Franklin's father was a tallow-candler, and young Benjamin in his autobiography says: "There was all appearance that I was destined to supply his place and become a tallow-candler. But my dislike to the trade continuing, my father was under apprehensions that if he did not find one for me more agreeable I should break away and get to sea, as his son Josiah had done, to his great vexation, He therefore sometimes took me to walk with him, and to see joiners, bricklayers, turners, braziers, etc. At their work, that he might observe my inclination, and endeavor to fix it on some trade or other on land." It is evident that Benjamin Franklin did not find his voca- 36 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE tion in that way, because the vocations in which he rendered his greatest service to humanity were not within the realm of his observation during his boyhood or youth. He lived nearly 85 years and was engaged in the following vocations: "Soap-boiler, candle-dipper, student, printer, author editor, postmaster, member of legislature, colonel, member of Continental Congress, one of the framers of the Declaration of Independence, inventor, scientist, philosopher, successful man of business, philanthropist statesman, diplomat, and member of 'the convention that framed the Constitution of the United States." Some of these may not be counted as vocations, but it is evident that few men in the history of the world have shown such versatility and adaptability. In this age of specialization it might be impossible to succeed in so many different vocations, but by the trial and error method there are some who try as many different vocations as Benjamin Franklin did. There is a more scientific method of directing young people to the vocation to which they are best adapted. This consists in making a thorough study of the developments, talents and tendencies of the youth and to learn the demands of the most common vocations. There are now nearly ten thousand different vocations required to do the world's work, and everybody must select one of them for himself. Many young people in the country become eminent later in life through vocations that they have no opportunity to observe in the community where they grow up. More than twenty years ago when the writer was teaching psychology and education in the Brigham Young University he was seriously studying this vital problem of vocational guidance and was consulted by many of the students. He met some of these, years later, and they testified that they had been successful and happy in the vocation that had been suggested to them and for which they had prepared. One of the most successful dentists of Utah wrote a few years ago stating that he had no. Thought of specializing in dentistry until advised to do so by the writer, but that his friends think he has been successful professionally and financially. A visit to his office while he is at work will convince anybody of his fitness for the work. He had been a carpenter before he went to the Brigham Young University. A few years ago the writer was employed to give vocational and moral guidance to all the boys and girls in the industrial schools of three states. In those schools there were about twenty vocations in which boys could receive training. This was an opportunity to train all the boys in the vocation to which they are best adapted, but in many instances the boys were shifted VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 37 from job to job and when they left the Industrial school they were much more likely to get into trouble than if they had been well trained in some vocation. In printing, shoemaking, and a few other lines where the boys are kept until they learn the trade, they often become very proficient. Some who do exceptionally well are classed as sub-normal boys before they are sent to the school. The superintendent of one of these schools told the writer that some of the sub-normal boys had become topnotchers in the different lines of agriculture and mechanic arts to which their tendencies adapted them. Vocational training in the public schools is one of the greatest helps in directing difficult boys and girls to a successful life. But such training should always be preceded by vocational guidance. For many years the writer has devoted most of his time to vocational guidance in the schools of more than 600 communities and has seen its great possibilities in helping young people to make the best use of their powers. He is now authorized, by the State Board of Education in California, to teach vocational guidance in the schools. His work is based upon the observational method of character study which can easily be learned by parents as well as by teachers. During the past six months he has had excellent classes in San Bernardino, Santa Monica, Glendale, Monrovia, Huntington Park, and Redondo Beach. Most of the work is done in the high school, but in some of these cities the superintendents of schools arranged to introduce the work into the higher grades of the grammar schools, where the desires of twenty-five years have been realized. In some instances the parent, the teacher, the principal, and the character analyst, all met with the child that was to receive moral and vocational guidance. Those who have the daily care of such children testified that they are able to do much more for them after having pointed out for them how the necessary adjustments in the life of the child can be made. When the home and the school give the necessary attention to such work, difficult children can be adjusted without the help of probation officers, juvenile courts or reform schools. Moral guidance should begin early in the child's life; vocational guidance is not necessary until the junior high school is entered. Without a knowledge of child-nature it is impossible to solve the problem of moral and vocational guidance. Responsibility of Parents in Teaching the Gospel to their Children By Lucy Wright Snow, Detroit, Michigan "A man is saved no faster than he gains knowledge, for if he does not get knowledge, he will be brought into captivity by some evil power in the other world, as evil spirits will have more knowledge, and consequently more power, than many men who are on the earth." (History of the Church, Vol. 4, p. 588.) Knowledge is power. The Prophet Joseph Smith tells us that when we have power to put all enemies under our feet in this world, death being the last, and a knowledge to triumph over all evil spirits in the world to come, then we are saved. In this age of ultra-sophistication of children, the duties of parents and teachers have multiplied, and it has become necessary to teach gospel truths and principles at a very early age. An earlier knowledge of the gospel as a protection is more necessary for the child of today than was necessary for the child of a few decades ago, previous to the introduction of the "movie," which has been such a factor in educating the child in crime as well as virtue; the automobile, the aeroplane, the wireless and other modern inventions conducive to education and advancement. Many of the new inventions have ushered in new evils, such as the poisonous gasses of war, and implements used for destruction of human life, until the very atmosphere of today is charged with information and influences averse to truth, thereby creating a crying need of efficiency and increased effort by parents and teachers to lend the necessary wise guidance and inspiration to anticipate and meet the real needs of the much tempted youth of the age. The wise parent might well ask the question, ""Am I measuring up to the requirements of my appointment as chaperone of these choice spirits that have been given into my care?" or, "How shall I make myself equal to this task?" Latter-day Saints have the commandments and methods revealed to them whereby they may know how to keep themselves unspotted from the world, and receive protection from the evils therein, if they will only obey the admonitions given them through the prophets. Modern revelation has brought to the Latter-day Saints the best educational facilities to be found. The principles of organization, as laid down by our modern prophet, Joseph Smith, have RESPONSIBILITY OF PARENTS 39 laid the foundation for a world peace through education and cooperation. How often might be traced doubt or lack of faith among the youth of Zion to their parents who have failed to inspire them with the beautiful and wonderful stories of the gospel, or who have themselves failed to give ear to the commandments! We find in Doc. And Cov. Sec. 69, a commandment given, bearing on responsibilities of parents, verse 25: "And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes, which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents." All principles of the gospel can be understood by the child if presented in a simple manner. The child should be taught in early life the value of keeping records of the important events that transpire in his life, such as birthday, first blessing, when and by whom given, date of baptism, etc. Stories of father's and mother's experiences are invaluable to the child and golden opportunities are offered for the child's guidance by their frequent repetition. A child loves to hear many, many times, father's experiences as a missionary, or other family history into which may be woven any of the principles one may wish to present. What child does not love to listen to mother's and father's love story, into which can be introduced the glorious principle of family organization for eternity? Teach the meaning of the Mosaic law—the law of justice, and compare with the higher law—that of love. A child loves to learn to sing the gospel, therefore explain the songs and hymns, and the conditions under which many of them were written. All of these subjects and many more, the child is perfectly capable of understanding, especially when well told and illustrated by stories from the scriptures. It is not unsual for missionaries to answer a call to preach the gospel when they have little knowledge of the plan of salvation which they are sent to teach, and while their obedience to the call and a humble spirit will bring the blessings of the Father to them in abundance, (for a humble spirit stands high with the Lord) yet often, because of their having failed to learn the principles of the gospel in their early youth they are handicapped and retarded in their development and have failed to gain a strong testimony 40 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE or great faith, and they are almost overcome by timidity and selfconsciousness in arising to address a congregation. It is then that they realize to the full extent that they are just awakening to the glorious truths that should have been incorporated into their very beings in early life. It is at this point that many missionaries give vent to the regretful expression, "Oh, why didn't my good father and mother teach me these 'aes in my childhood?" At a recent visit to Kirtland it was my privilege to camp with my family over night on the grounds of the Kirtland temple, and as I lay pondering far into the night over the glorious manifestations given to the Prophet Joseph and. O'hers in that edifice, my heart was filled to overflowing with rejoicing and gratitude to God that I had gained the knowledge of these things and that I had received in my early youth a testimony of the gospel, and I wondered what proportion of the children of Zion know that the Lord and his Son, Jesus Christ, visited in person this temple on April 3, 1836, and made themselves known to Joseph and Oliver Cowdery, Doc. And Cov. Sec. 110:2: "We saw the Lord standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit before us, and uner his feet was a paved work of pure gold in color like amber." "After this vision closed Moses appeared before us and committed unto us the keys of the gathering of Israel, and after this, Elias, and then the glorious vision of Elijah the Prophet with his important message saying that he was sent to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the children to the fathers." At the first ray of dawn I arose and followed in the direction of a weak, mournful cry which I had heard for some time and found a little mourning dove deserted and crying for food, and again the question arose in my mind, "Have any of our children been deserted and left crying for the bread of life?"

The Art of Cookery in the Hotel | Utah The preparation of food has become an art in modern days. Indeed it has always been considered so in polite nations. Men, (and it is nearly always men who reach the highest place in this famous old art) have been knighted by sovereigns, made famous by poets, and have been considered as philosophers and artists. Indeed, this is not to be wondered at; for chemistry of foods, although not understood and made a part of educational life, until recent years, is still a science in the assembling of materials and making new combinations out of elemental processes; and chemistry is as worthy of study in the kitchen as it is in any laboratory. To create a new dish is no mean achievement; certain underlying principles of combination of materials are known to every cook, trained and untrained, but the blending of flavors, the art of making a dish possess individuality, while still retaining health-giving ingredients—this is a labor which all should respect, and women, at least, should understand. Just recently a famous cook who had created a national reputation for her corn-beef hash, received a legacy of $25,000 from her former mistress and patron, Mrs. Mark Hanna, of Washington, D. C. Of all nations which have made cooking an art, France excels. Thrift and economy are cardinal virtues in that wonderful nation; but the French add to these fundamental virtues the fine apperception which dignifies cooking and makes of ihe house-wifely arts, a national asset. Practically all of the famous chefs (cooks) of ancient and modern times come from France. The European nations without exception secure their finest exponents of the art of cookery from among distinguished French chefs. Scarcely a famous hostelry in Europe or America is without a French chef, who presides with dignity and supreme skill over the laboratories where food is compounded and prepared for the patrons who demand the last word in cookery. We have asked the management of the Hotel Utah to permit us the use of recipes by the locally famous chef, Louis J. Theu, of that Hotel. He chose modest combinations suited to the simple tastes and prudent expenditures of the great mass of readers of the Magazine, though we shall also present some more elaborate recipes so that all of our readers may have an 42 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE opportunity of testing their own chemical and culinary powers. The following directions are here given for food combinations: ENGLISH BREAD PUDDING. Cut into half inch pieces, half pound stale crustless bread, soak in a little cold milk five minutes; then squeeze out milk and place in a bowl, s'ir with a wooden spoon a few minutes; then add two ounces of butter, three ounces sugar, three whole eggs, four ounces well picked currants, six crusted macaroons, half teaspoon of vanilla essence, a little salt and two gills of cream. Mix well. Lightly butter a quart pudding mould; drop preparation into it, place in a sauce pan, pour in hot water up to half the height of the mould and set in oven thirty minutes. Remove, unmold the pudding in a hot dish and serve with sweet cream. SPONGE FOR FRENCH BREAD AND ROLLS. Sift on table two pounds best quality thoroughly ripe flour, place half in a bowl sufficiently large to hold six or seven quarts and carefully make a fountain in center of it. Place a half ounce cake of fresh, firm, cold compressed yeast in bowl, ptt over a half pint luke warm water and thoroughly dissolve with hand for two and a half minutes: pour into fountain, mix a little, gradually incorporate flour for five minutes and sharply knead all well together for six minutes. Cover bowl with dry cloth, then lay vessel in a warm place of 80 degrees to rise, (two and a half to three hours), without touching it; the sponge will then have risen to double size, fallen, risen again and be. In proper condition for dough. In using flour for any kind of bread and rolls, always remember never to employ flour when cold or warm, that is to say it should be in a place of 60 degrees temperature at least twelve hours before using it. Dough—Place in a bowl a half pint of luke warm water, as the same quantity of luke warm milk, half ounce of salt and dissolve for a minute; uncover bowl, pour water on sponge, thoroughly knead the whole well together for six minutes, add little by little the remaining pound of flour. The kneading operation after the flour has been added should continue for thirty minutes; lift up dough with the hand, and knock as hard as you can against bottom of vessel ten different times, cover vessel and allow to rise for two and a half hours again, then shape your bread or rolls as you like and let rise again for a few minutes then it will be ready to bake. Be careful to see the oven is at proper degree of heat. COOKING IN THE HOTEL UTAH 43 ROAST LEG OF LAMB (WITH JARDINIERE OF VEGETABLES ) Have nice tender, rather small, leg of lamb. Trim the handle bone neatly, rub half ounce butter or good fat all over it. Season with salt and pepper; place in roasting pan, put little cold water into the pan and roast in the oven for one hour, basting it once in a while, remove from the oven, dress on a hot dish, skim off the fat from the gravy and strain over the meat— dress the jardiniere all around the leg and serve. JARDINIERE OF VEGETABLES. With a small vegetable scoop, dig out two medium size carrots and turnips, place them in a sauce pan with a pint of water, let cook until soft about thirty minutes, drain the vegetables, put them back in the saucepan with a little butter, adding green peas, string beans cut into half inch pieces, season to taste, and mix well together, without mashing, let slowly cook on the corner of the range for five minutes and it will be ready to use. A piece of cauliflower, asparagus tip, and a few very small Brussels sprouts can be added to the jardiniere if at hand. CELERY AND APPLE SALAD WITH MAYONNAISE. Have two stalks fresh, white, crisp, celery, trim off the outer leaves, wash thoroughly, drain well, then cut into small julienne-shaped strips, place on a napkin and dry it. Peel three medium size apples, cut them in julienne same as the celery. Place both in a salad bowl, season with dressing and mix well and serve. MAYONNAISE DRESSING. Place two fresh egg yolks in a small bowl, salt, and a little white pepper, and English mustard, tablespoon good vinegar. Briskly beat up the whole together for a minute, then add, drop by drop, a pint of good cool olive oil, continually mixing while adding it, and continue mixing four minutes after the oil has been added, add the juice of one-quarter of a sound lemon; mix for one minute more, then use when required. Place the surplus of the Mayonnaise in a cup, put it in a cool place as it will keep in good condition for two or three days. The disarmament conference at Washington, in taking up the matter of financial burdens, with our U. S. Army costing $418,000,000 a year rightly considers that a staggering amount. Why not "disarm" the whole tobacco business and save $2,000,- 000,000 a year? Some day we will. Mark the prediction. World Happenings James H. Anderson Italy was greatly disturbed in November, by political riots in which many persons were killed. In Russia, typhus fever is reported as claiming its thousands of victims in the autumn months of 1921. Lord Reading, of England, or Rufus Daniel Isaacs, is the first Jew to be made viceroy of India. The L. D. S. Temple site at Mesa, Ariz, was dedicated by President Heber J. Grant on November 28. He was accompanied by Prest. A. W. Ivins and Prest. Rudger Clawson. American troops are being withdrawn from Germany, the first contingent having started home the last week in November. Japan is willing to reduce naval armament according to American suggestion, but retains her hold on Siberia. The anti-beer bill, forbidding unlimited doctors' prescriptions for beer in the United States, became a law on November 23. President Harding's idea of an association of nations for peace was received with favor in November and December, but the detail of working it out is still "in the air." In India, in November, a detatchment of British troops was massacred, and shortly previous thereto, 64 natives were smothered to death in a railway car where they were confined as British prisoners. Sixteen high school students were killed near Red Blufi, Calif. On November 30, when a railway train ran into a motor bus carrying children. The United States, Great Britain and Japan all have stopped building battleships pending action by the limitation of armament conference in Washington. WORLD HAPPENINGS 45 Premier Briand, of France, in the limitation of armament conference at Washington, gave notice that France could not reduce armament in existing conditions, then left for home. Archaeological discoveries made recently near Phoenix, Arizona, show conclusively that two civilizations existed in the Salt River valley prior to the present native population. Ireland was granted the dominion status known as a free state in the British empire, the first week in December, and the trouble there with the British government has quieted down for the present. Strikes occurred in various parts of the United States during October, November, and the early part of December, mostly failures, but persisted in, thus showing the general unrest prevailing. A new revenue law was passed by Congress in November, but it was not satisfactory, and in his message to Congress in December, President Harding recommended many changes. The limitation of armament conference in Washington. Up to the first week in December, had agreed on reducing battleships both in number and construction, but the more expensive and destructive means of modern warfare, such as airplanes, submarines, chemical bombs and poison gases, was untouched. WHAT WOMEN ARE DOING Maria Padin Fernandez, 120 years of age and the oldset woman in Spain, died in November. Christine Nilsson, the great operatic soprano, died at Copenhagen, Denmark, on November 22, aged 78 years. The National League of Women Voters met in Chicago, Ill., December 1, 2, and 3, and arranged for the study, by the women, of political questions. The costume of eighty stage girls at a Paris, France, theatre, in November weighed 46 pounds in all—mostly beads. 46 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE Miss Lucy VanCott, dean of the women at the University of Utah, filed an effective protest in November against profanity in college yells there. Women are displacing service men in employment in Great Britain by thousands, and in December the service men made a great public protest. Miss Katherine S. Deveril and Miss Frances C. Kyle. Just qualified as barristers in the courts of Great Britain, are the first women in that land to attain the distinction. Mrs. J. F. Gardner, of Salt Lake City, Utah, has invented a speedometer to place on the exterior of automobiles, so the rate of speed can be ascertained by others than the chaffeur. A high English social authority announced in London in November that American women are more companionable with one another than are the women of other nationalities. Women delegates were selected in December, in several States, to take an active part in the good roads convention in Chicago on January 17 to 20, 1922. Girls in Austria are now advertising freely for husbands. The advertised conditions, however, show that these girls are not willing to trust themselves to "trash" in male article. The Duchess of Albany, aunt of King George of Great Britain, won first prizes at the London British-grown-vegetable show in October, for beets, yellow tomatoes, and oyster plant. 'The first breach of promise case in France where the plaintiff secured damages was tried in November, a Frenchman who had jilted his fiancee on the eve of the date of the wedding having to pay her 2000 francs. The Bishop of London, England, made a public protest in November against "over-smoking, over-exuberance, and swearing, by young women." The significance of the necessity of such protest is apparent. WORLD HAPPENINGS | 47 At the National Council of Women in Philadelphia, recently, Mrs. Amy Brown Lyman, and Mrs. Emily C. Adams, of Utah, secured the passage of an anti-cigarette resolution, to be supported by the women in various States. In Great Britain in 1920, there were less than one-third the number of women in prison than there were in 1914, according to official announcement in November. It was not so with the men prisoners. Dr. Letitia Fairfield, British medical officer, announced in November that "girls ought not to play football, box, or motorcycle," if they place any value on their health. Princess Mary, daughter of King George of England, was betrothed to become the bride of Viscount Lascelles, an English military officer, between Christmas and Dec. 51, 1921. The princess is said to be quite a home-woman, but far from being homely. Gandhi, who headed the anti-British movement in India in 1921, met his real defeat there when he forbade the women of India to wear the finer English weaves for dresses, as the Hindu women resolutely refused to obey his mandate. Miss Annie Mathews, elected to take the office of register in New York City on January 1, 1922, gets a salary of $12,000 a year—the highest official salary to a woman in the United States. She says she will permit women to wear whatever clothes pleases them. Madamoiselle Mistinguett, the famous French comedienne, when on the liner France crossing the Atlantic in November, was announced by the master of ceremonies at a steamer banquet as "the foremost European vedette for thirty years." She regarded the reference to her age as an insult, and refused to appear. Lucy Gage Gaston, who has severed her connection with the Anti-Cigarette League of America, is now forming a new organization to be known as the "Clean Life Movement," according to press reports. Its adherents will be pledged not only against cigarettes, but against tobacco in any and every form, and to lead a clean life morally. When tobacco is prohibited the morals of our youth will be greatly improved. Eightythree per cent of the boys who use tobacco have practiced sex immoralities.

And what will you bring to the pages of the Magazine, baby New Year? Nothing very new, for truth is very, very old. And truth lies at the root of all our plans, our hopes. We love truth, you and I, dear friendly reader. And even you, too, you critical one, you love truth, perhaps even more than we do. But if you are wise you also know that, after all, our ideas about truth vary as do the shapes of our noses. A crowd hears a sermon or song, witnesses an accident, or attends a party and joins in light talk. Which two of all the crowd, or the audience, tell exactly the same story of the occurrence; No two people can. All may agree as to essentials, but details strike each one differently as their angle of approach and as their ideas and ideals differ; so, we may only hope, you and I, good friend reader or readeress, that the New Year will bring us approximate joy in one another's society. You know, readers, I have you at a disadvantage; for I can tell 50,000 of you with one stroke of the pen what I think about truth, and only one of you at a time can talk back to me. However, in this editorial we will cheerfully agree to give you readers, as nearly as possible, the very things you want to read, and from as composite an angle as is possible to one human "We?! You have liked, apparently, the very simple editorial policy of the past nine years, and unless you show future displeasure that policy will go right on through the year of 1922. EDITORIAL 49 That policy has been: to print articles, poems, stories and departments written by Latter-day Saint women (rarely men) for Latter-day Saint readers. Life's problems, as they affect the mature women, touch the members of this Society closely. These problems may be religious, domestic, civic or organization problems. The treatment of these problems or plots or ideas in verse, story or article may be scholarly and polished, or amateur and crude. But when two articles or poems are side by side there are two standards by which We judge and choose: one is, the spirit that pervades it; second, the manner of its expression. As between a cold, spiritless, finished story, and a halting, crudely-told tale, breathing a testimony of the gospel from start to finish, we choose the inspired story, if it is at all possible; we may have to dress it up as best We may with our red and blue pencil. Where culture and the spirit of the gospel are combined that is the ideal for which We strive, the story We seek, the poem We long to receive. For We do set up a literary standard as well as a spiritual one. Then We try to bring in new writers; to represent various sections of the Church and country; to treat up-to-date questions; to dress our old, old truth in modern terminology; to watch the signs of the times and note fulfilment of prophecy; to cultivate a taste for the beautiful in life, here and hereafter; to comfort, warm, bless, advise and, in short, to administer wisely and well this responsible office and calling. Whatever good is done comes from the Lord; whatever mistakes are made are our own. (We hear plenty about them.) (Above all, We present to this greatest of all women's organizations the spirit and letter of the instructions and conferences taught and held by the Presidency and General Board of the Society itself; and news of Relief Society women, and of the Relief Society everywhere; these together with the lessons in our Guide make up Your Relief Society Magazine. WEEK'S STUDY IN THE BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY During "Leadership Week" at the Brigham Young University from January 23 to 28, a department will be given over to the Relief Society workers. A class will meet each morning of the five days according to announcement of Prof. John C. Swenson, who has charge of arranging the program at the University. Other work being offered during the week which will be of special interest to the women will include courses in home- 50 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE making, teacher-training, genealogy and temple work, health problems and a course for presiding officers. The work will all be given under the auspices of the Extension Division of the B. Y. U. And provision will be made to accommodate the people who come in from outlying stakes. Each evening during the week will be given over to an entertainment for the visitors, and the afternoons will be taken up with general meetings at which prominent men and women of the State and Church will be engaged to speak.

NOTICE TO STAKE SECRETARIES. Stake Secretaries will please see that their compiled reports are sent in to the General Secretary as soon as possible after January 10, and not later than January 20, 1922. WE ACKNOWLEDGE Mesa, which once recalled sand, drifting winds and barren mesas; then the Mesa which witnessed great experiments in ostrich-raising; Mesa where cotton grew and then where cotton failed; Mesa, where the Temple is to rear its beautiful columns. This Mesa now enters the lists with the largest oranges, the most | luscious grape-fruit seen in many a day. We can testify of this latter fact through the Christmas kindness of our friends, the Elijah Allens. May Mesa continue to be as fruitful as the garden of Eden. TO STAKE TEACHER TRAINING SUPERVISORS Dear Brethren and Sisters: The teacher-training work for the Church during 1922 will be a study of the "Principles of the Gospel." The material has been prepared in outline form and will be ready for distribution by the Deseret Book Store, December 27, 1921, price 35 cents, the name of the pamphlet being, "An Outline Study of the Principles of the Gospel." The Correlation-Social Advisory Committee, under whose direction the outline has been prepared, strongly recommends that every teacher in the Church obtain one of such outlines, and further that regular attendance at teacher-training classes in every ward in the Church be the practice of every individual who has been called to the most important duty and privilege 'of teaching the gospel. In connection with the class work to be carried on, the Committee recommends a slight change over last year's schedule of meetings. As you know, the practice has been as follows: First meeting, Regular normal class. Second meeting, Business meeting of the various organizations. 'Third meeting, Regular norma! Class. Fourth meeting, Department groups of the various organizations for the purpose of study and outlining lessons. The Committee recommends no change in the procedure of the first three meetings. With reference to the fourth meeting, however, it is recommended that the work formerly scheduled for that meeting be taken up at a regular monthly stake union meeting. In some stakes union meetings (sometimes called "Priesthood") are already being held, in connection with which the auxiliary organizations do their regular stake union work, and in some stakes each of the various organizations have separate stake meetings each month. It is contemplated under either of these conditions that no additional union meeting shall be provided, but that the work of preparing lessons be done at whatever stake meeting is being held. In stakes where no stake meeting has been provided for the doing of such work, it is recommended that such a meeting be instituted. A well conducted union meeting is most helpful to the organizations of the Church. It will be observed that under the plan outlined above only three ward meetings per month have been scheduled, the fourth meeting to be a stake meeting. However, where the stake meeting will not interfere, a fourth meeting, devoted to the course of study, may be held in the wards. Guide Lessons for January LESSON 1. Theology and Testimony (First Week in March.) MEMORABLE PRAYERS. Memorable prayers may be classified as prayers of complete record, prayers of partial record, and prayers referred to and not recorded, or prayers of reference. In this lesson we shall deal with simple petition, and not with ordinance prayers, and it will be limited to the consideration of prayers of complete record.: The prayer offered by the brother of Jared, about 2000 B. C., recorded in the Book of Mormon, Ether 3:1-4, is a wonderful prayer, and the first one of which we have complete record, and ranks as one of the memorable events in the history of a great people. The reading of it is strongly faith-promoting. Jacob's covenant prayer at Bethel, Genesis 28:18-22?a prayer of record with which our children should be made acquainted, in fact as a memory gem this prayer will be a lifelong inspiration toward the performance of a sacred financial duty. The prayer of Abraham's servant at the well, Genesis 24:42-44, indicates that the Lord was interested in the mating alliance of Israel, and we have no evidence that he has changed in this particular. The prayer of the Prophet Zenos seems to be of sufficiently complete record to have place in this class. This prayer is a most perfect counting of blessings before the Lord. Alma 44:4-11. Its literary merit alone makes it worth reading. The prayer of dedication of the Temple of Solomon comes in this group; it is an inspiring piece of spiritual literature, recorded in I Kings 8:22-57. Solomon's prayer for wisdom, I Kings, Chapter 3:7-9 inclusive. The uttering of this prayer was the wisest thing that Solomon ever did. The Lord's prayer is a most important prayer of complete record. The first word "our" eliminates selfishness, and the word "Father" is God's family or patriarchal name, not his official name. The word "Father" eliminates distance, and brings us into the closest and most tender relations possible. The phrase, GUIDE LESSONS 53 "which art in heaven" restricts or centers the interest to one being, and by implication acknowledges the existence of other fathers. The expression, "hallowed by thy name" places a halo of spiritual reverence around the name of God, pointing strongly to the glory of the position of fatherhood. "Thy kingdom come" calls for a recognition of the existence of heaven, with God as the "Father King." "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven" is representative of a desire to do willingly here and now, and have everybody do willingly what God would have done, because that will bring heaven or make a heaven of this earth. "Give us this day our daily bread." This sentence contains a confession of need, and a recognition that the Lord can supply ? that need. Not so much the needs of our bodies but the needs of our spirits. To the properly taught it is a petition for what the Lord sees is best for us. "Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us." This complex sentence is a request with a selfimposed condition, amounting to a declaration of willingness to remain unforgiven just to the extent that we will not forgive. "Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil." The second part of this sentence indicates the truth of what the Apostle James says concerning temptation, James 1:13. The call for deliverance is a recognition of the fact that we expect to be environed by evil which would overcome us if the Lord left us there. "Thine be the Kingdom, and the power, and glory forever and ever" is a concentration of an expressed desire for God to be our King, always, and with power to govern in his own way with honor and love, because it all belongs to him. The word "Amen," meaning "so be it," is a reaffirmation of all we have said. The prayer of the Savior before going to Gethsemane, John 17, is perhaps the greatest prayer of record ever uttered. It should be read in meeting. This thrice repeated prayer at Gethsemane is a perfect exemplification of the subordination of desire to will. Matt. 26:39-42. The petition on the cross, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do," Luke 23-34, contains so much of the divine and so little of the human, that comments are all out of place, other than to say that it was character ideality realized. Christ's final prayer on the cross may be found in Luke 23:46. Christ's prayer on this continent, after his resurrection, Book of Mormon III Nephi, 19:19-23. The prayer of the prophet in Liberty jail and its answer Doc. & Cov. 121:1-23. This prayer is one of the most perfect 54 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE illustrations of the difference between anger and righteous indignation, to be found in sacred literature. The prayers offered at the dedication of temples, the first one of this dispensation being recorded in Section 109, Doctrine & Covenants. There is much material for the student of "Mormon" sociology. It is one of the great landmarks in the progressive history of the Latter-day Saints. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.. 1. In the light of James 1:13, would it be unorthodox to substitute "leave us not in temptation,' for "lead us not into temptation?" 2. In the light of Doctrine and Covenants, 36:41, would it be theologically proper to open or close the Lord's prayer in the "name of Jesus Christ?" Book of Mormon, III Nephi, 18:19. 3. Why was Solomon's prayer for wisdom the wisest thing he ever did? 4, Show that the brother of Jared literally prayed for light. 5. What is the big lesson to be learned from the prayer of the Prophet Joseph in Liberty jail? 6. Why will historians and sociologists make a special study of our temple dedicatory prayer? 7. Of what special value to you is the prayer recorded in the Book of Mormon, II Nephi, 4:16-35? 8. What doctrine concerning church elections is taught in the prayer recorded in Acts 1:24? LESSON II. Work and Business Second Week In March. LESSON ITI. Literature Third Week in March. In our last lesson we devoted considerable space to the compositions of Professor George Careless, and of such importance are his compositions, to Latter-day Saint hymnology, that we feel fully justified in devoting a second lesson to his work. GUIDE LESSONS 55 In a recent interview with Professor Careless, he said that he always enjoyed writing music to Eliza R. Snow's poems, because they are so full of substance. He relates the following touching story of the composition called "Reliance," sung to the words of "Though deepening trials throng your way." Professor Careless at the time was prostrate with grief and illness; for three weeks he had been unable to eat, so that his vitality was greatly reduced. His grief resulted from the loss of his wife, Lavina Triplett Careless; a soprano with a voice of rich beauty, and also he was suffering from heavy financial loss. When his little daughter, then twelve years of age, saw her father going into a decline, she became fearful lest he might not recover, and in the agony of her soul exclaimed, "Father, I am not going to lose you also!' At this cry of pain from the child, he rallied and said, "No, my child; give mea piece of paper." She handed him the paper and he wrote the music "Reliance." We have here a remarkable instance of music being made the medium of solace and comfort and fortitude for a soul bowed down with sorrow. The music known as "Parting," sung to words written by President Charles W. Penrose, was composed for and first sung at the funeral service of Brigham Young. This hymn is not to be found either in the hymn book or the Psalmody. Professor Careless could write music on the spur of the moment. He tells the story of Gen. Charles S. Burton coming to him at the demise of his wife, Julia, and placing some lines within his hand, asked that Professor Careless set them to music that they might be sung at her funeral service. Professor Careless did as Mr. Burton requested, and this piece of music, which Mr. Burton called "Julia" was sung at Mrs. Burton's funeral service. "Rest," written for the funeral service of President George A. Smith, (the father of Clarissa S. Williams, now the honored president of the Relief Society) was set to Eliza R. Snow's words "Hark, from afar a funeral knell." Professor Careless tells us that it was the custom, at the time he was director of the Tabernacle Choir, to have choir practice Friday evenings, "One Sunday afternoon during the services Ebenezer Beesley asked me what we should sing the following Friday night at choir practice." Professor Careless paused for a moment, then said, "Wait, and I will show you." He recalls the incident as if it were yesterday. Prest. Wilford Woodruff was addressing the audience. Brother Careless does not tell us whether anything Elder Woodruff was 96 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE saying influenced what he was doing, but what he does tell 'us is that he wrote the music in those moments, that the Saints have sung for many years to the words of, "Arise, my soul arise." Professor Careless says there were very few Sacrament hymns, so that he frequently wrote music to words suitable for sacrament hymns, in an attempt to supply this want. On the following Friday the choir practiced this new music, and the next Sunday sang it, very much to the delight of President Brigham Young, who was very fond of music. On another occasion, Ebenezer Beesley, who succeeded Professor Careless as choir leader, asked that Brother Careless compose some music for "Another day has fled," as Brother Beesley regarded these words as especially choice. In accord with Brother Beesley's request, Professor Careless wrote the music and called it "Meditation." The hymn is very greatly liked by many people. In telling the story of "Meditation" Professor Careless remarked "Ebenezer Beesley was a student of mine, and I was very proud of his talent." The thing that stands out prominently in all of Professor Careless' recitals, in relation to his compositions, is that they were done, as it were, on the instant, and yet they endure. We have all lived to realize how rare men of Professor Careless' genius are; the Latter-day Saints assuredly owe this greatly gifted man a debt which we have not yet fathomed; still of this one thing we are certain, that wherever song is sacred among the Latter-day-Saints, wherever the songs of Zion are used as a medium of praise to the Almighty, the name of George Careless will be held in gratitude and sacred remembrance. QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS. 1. Have the words of "Reliance" read, then sung to the Careless music. Do you think the words and music are in keeping with the story of its composition? 2. Who was Professor George Careless' successor, as leader of the Tabernacle Choir? 3. List the sacrament hymns in the L. D. S. Hymn book to which Professor Careless has set music. (See Psalmody, Edition I, or II.) 4. List the hymns in the L D. S. Hymn book, written by Eliza R. Snow, to which Professor Careless has set music. (See Psalmody, Edition I, or IT.), 5. Read very carefully the words of "Another day has fled;" then listen to the music played on the organ. Do you think Professor Careless has caught the spirit of the words in his music? 6. Do you think "Meditation" a good name for this composition? 7. Have some one prepare a brief sketch of the life of George Careless. Material may be found in Volume I Church Biographical Encyclopedia, GUIDE LESSONS 57 LESSON IV. Social Service Fourth Week in March. PHYSICAL EFFICIENCY AND THE HOME. According to the ancient Greeks, the body is the outward symbol of health and beauty of the soul. The mediaeval thinkers, on the other hand, saw in the body only sensuality. Man's fleshly nature was regarded as an obstacle which hinders spiritual development. The Latter-day Saints view the physical body of man somewhat as did the Greeks; it is the sacred tabernacle of the spirit. The soul of man, or man in his perfect state, is the union of the body and the spirit. The body is furthermore the means through which the spirit develops its powers. Health, vitality, endurance, are essential to the moral, intellectual, and spiritual development of man, as well as basic to the enjoyment of life. Although many who have been handicapped by weak physical constitutions, have attained greatness, many more have failed to succeed because of poor health. And it is reasonable to suppose that those of poor health who did succeed would have made even greater success if this handicap had not existed. We are concerned here not so much with the general problem of health as we are with the question of health in relation to the home. Two questions should be answered in this and the following lesson: (1) how does the question of health affect the home? And (2) how can the home control the conditions of health? WHY PARENTS SHOULD HAVE GOOD HEALTH. Without question there is no responsibility in life that draws more heavily upon physical vitality than that of home leadership. The great majority of men who support families in our communities are compelled to devote the greater part of their lives to hard work. The average man during a period of thirty or forty years will have some members of his family depending directly upon his earning power. Since the great majority of the heads of families are men whose income depends entirely upon their labor, it follows naturally that when their strength fails, their income discontinues. Nor is the demand made upon the physical vitality of the wife and mother less severe than that made upon the husband and father. As a housewife and mother, there will come to her life few vacations. The average woman works early and late 58 ' RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE and all the time. When she is ill, the entire family suffers. All household duties are neglected, the discipline of the children breaks down. More important than as a housewife, is woman as a mother; and to perform this function requires even more physical vitality and nerve energy. To give birth to children, and to care for them properly, is a task that demands all the strength, energy, and health that God has given the average woman. SIGNIFICANCE OF PREVENTIVE MEASURES IN MATTERS OF HEALTH. Poor health is frequently due to carelessness; often it is the result of ignorance; but sometimes it is due to conditions over which the parents have no control. But whatever may be the cause, it is the spirit and purpose of our organization to remove suffering and lighten human burdens, wherever and whenever occasions present themselves. We are quite sure, however, that to educate the young men and women, both single and married, to a realization of the importance of health and to train them in the method and conditions of health is more economical than to care for them when they are sick. The schools are doing a great deal in this respect, but the home can do even more; it can put into effect the principles of health taught in the schools; it can make the health ideals actual habits of life. These principles of health can best be impressed upon the mind of youth if parents themselves show proper respect for their own bodies. Too often a father or a mother will make unwise and. Unnecessary sacrifices of their own health in order to carry on the ordinary home duties. This attitude of parents toward their own bodies is sure not to stimulate in the minds of their children the importance of health, and moreover it will sooner or later render the parent less efficient. Young people are inclined to lessen their vitality through reckless pursuit of amusements and through dissipation; parents often sacrifice their own health through the daily life of toil. Our aim should be to have every member of the family, from: the youngest to the oldest, occasionally examined by an expert physician. This examination will reveal whether the body is in proper condition and whether improper and unnecessary sacrifices of health are being tolerated either in child or parent. It may be better economy to employ a doctor before we break down in health, than afterwards. And it is sure to have real educational value. GUIDE LESSONS 59 QUESTIONS, 1, What is the doctrine of the Latter-day Saints regarding the relation between the body and the spirit? How do we define the soul of man? 2. What evidence can you present to show that a good mind requires a healthy body? 3. In what way does poor health affect the welfare of the home? 4. Why should (a) the father and (b) the mother enjoy health? 5. What justification can you give for physical examination, even though you are apparently in perfect health? 6. Describe (a) the man (b) the woman, whom you consider physicially fit for marriage. 7. In relation to health education, justify the expression, "An ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure." TEACHER'S TOPIC March RELIEF SOCIETY ORGANIZATION. I. _ Reasons for its organization.
