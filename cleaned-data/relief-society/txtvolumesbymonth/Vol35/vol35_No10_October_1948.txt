THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE EPILOGUE Beatrice K. Ekman I have come back to our mountains,
To our valleys and inland sea;
To cedared hills and cattle range,
In quest of tranquility.
Warm wind flows down from the foothills
And pours over fields of grain;
Glistening blades of tasseled corn
Are rippling and rustling again;
Watching the bearded barley blow,
In billowing waves like the sea,
Brings back a spindrift of moments
That are lost forever to me.
Over the hills dry leaves will drift,
Winters will lay white covers down;
Springs will return and lilies bend,
The summers fade and fields burn brown.... 
As west wind combs the mauve hill grass
And brine waves cream the sands with foam,
So, shuttle-swift, let my days pass
Until I reach my love and home.
VOL. 35, NO. 10 OCTOBER 1948

Your Friend—the Magazine Alberta H. Christensen Member, Relief Society General Board

Of the most challenging statements in Latter-day Saint literature is found in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 130:18-19. It is this:
"Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.
And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come."
If this be true, and we believe it is, we are under the moral obligation to study and to learn, to seek wisdom through the pursuit of truth.
Limitations of time and mental capacity may prevent us from being expert in most fields, but each of us can enlarge her understanding by study and by maintaining mental alertness to the opportunities around us.

All Latter-day Saint women are familiar with the words of the Prophet, spoken at the Relief Society meeting of April 28, 1842, when he said,
"... And this society shall rejoice and knowledge and intelligence shall flow down from this time henceforth."
It was thus the intent from the beginning of the organization that intelligence, which is the capacity for understanding, should grow and expand through divine guidance, and that the gaining of knowledge should be fostered, its power felt and wisely used by its members.

Page 652

It is also apparent that the dual objective of the Relief Society was recognized at this early date. Service to others and the development of self have been the two-fold aim kept constantly in mind by those who have guided the organization to its present maturity.
An educational program was organized which has developed through succeeding years. In time, uniform courses of study were planned, their specific purpose being to teach those eternal principles which are the foundation of the gospel; to develop faith through understanding so that all might enjoy the fruits of the spirit: and to assist the members in meeting the daily problems of life.

It was with a definite objective and with definite needs in mind that The Relief Society Magazine came into being. Its editors have been and are conscious of the needs and problems which face the Latter-day Saint family and are endeavoring to help in their solution through this medium.
They are conscious of the busy life which the average Latter-day Saint mother lives and have selected types of material which will not only meet personal needs but will conform in reading time to a busy schedule. This wise selection of material is important, for the complexity of modern living demands that we be selective as never before.

The woman of today furnishes her home
by choosing from many types of furniture and multiple objects of art.
She chooses her wardrobe from numerous fabrics and designs,
and her hobbies from a wide variety of interesting activities.
Discrimination is especially important in filling her leisure time, for in spite of the many labor-saving devices, her interests have widened and there is increased activity from which to choose.

Someone has wisely said that it is not what one needs to do but what one chooses to do that distinguishes character. 
The woman of today must be especially selective in her reading
for the amount of printed material placed monthly before the public is tremendous.
She must select from this morass that which she feels will best fill her needs, mentally, aesthetically, and spiritually.
With time as a limiting factor, it is obvious that she must choose wisely.

Does The Relief Society Magazine qualify to a place on the selective reading list of the Latter-day Saint woman? I think that it does because it meets so many of her needs. Helpful suggestions on almost all phases of homemaking are given.
Pre-tested recipes and nutritional budget-wise menus lead the busy housewife to new ways of preparing familiar foods.
Suggestions on making and remodeling of clothing should be especially appreciated at present because of the sudden change in design and length.

There is poetry and short fiction for an aesthetic lift—a little star dust to sprinkle on the ironing board and the dishpan.
Letters from near and distant readers attest the fact that the quality of both poem and story is being improved and appreciated. 
The Magazine also supplies a market (though limited) for the creative efforts of Latter-day Saint women.
Although not many contributions can be used monthly, encouragement is offered writers through the Eliza R. Snow Poem and the Relief Society Short Story contests and through the gracious consideration of material submitted at any time.

The outlines for the courses of study are not only indispensable to the class leaders,
but can be equally helpful and stimulating to all who read them carefully.
Much thought and skill have gone into their preparation.
Here is a deep well of wisdom for every reader who will make the text her own through individual reflection. 
Here is guidance in the art of living for all who will make application.
And here is found in the counsel of the wise, a kindly light which mellows trials and can heal a sorrow.

Editorials and special articles offer spiritual enrichment to all who read them thoughtfully,
and one must not overlook the attractive covers which the Magazine is "wearing."
They have received much commendation. 
"Notes from the Field" with accompanying photographs impress us with the unity of purpose and strength of a great organization.
But perhaps the Magazine's greatest service lies in the fact that it radiates a definite spiritual influence;
a service-loving, beauty-seeking influence which can revitalize any home which greets it and treats it as a friend.

Relief Society Building News
"Building News" will continue to be printed until the names of all stakes and wards, missions and branches which attained 100% of the Building Fund have been printed,
in order that they may be recognized and that The Relief Society Magazine may contain a full historical record.
There will be many mementos of the past epoch-making year treasured by Relief Society through coming years. 
First will be the voluminous central record preserved by the general board in book form
in which will be inscribed the name of every Relief Society Quota Gift contributor, and that of every Special Gift and Memorial Gift contributor.

It is planned that the compiled names of contributors will be kept in a special case in the Relief Society Building. Likewise, in the cornerstone of the Relief Society Building will be placed a duplicate listing of contributors to remain as long as the Relief Society Building itself stands. Each stake and mission in the Church achieving 100% will guard the Certificate of Achievement issued to it. Every ward and branch in the Church achieving 100% will also have a Certificate of Achievement to treasure as evidence of the loyalty and faithfulness of the sisters of that ward or branch. In addition, the ward and branch record books will contain a detailed account of all contributions to become a lasting record of the generosity of Relief Society and church members today.

Any Relief Society member may be the proud possessor of three types of receipt cards: (1) the Quota Receipt Card for the payment of a quota donation; (2) a Special Gift Receipt Card for the payment of a donation in excess of the quota; and (3) Memorial Gift Receipt Card for every Memorial Gift made. Non-Relief Society members may prize two types of receipt cards— a Special Gift Receipt Card and a Memorial Gift Receipt Card. These individual Receipt Cards will become increasingly prized over the years.

Many of the great future leaders of Relief Society who today are mere girls will undoubtedly own "Special Gift Receipt Cards." The Relief Society, as part of the Church, makes painstaking records and carefully preserves them, and out of Relief Society record books will shine forever bright the devoted and unselfish services of the women of the Church in the Relief Society Building Fund program of October 1947 to October 1948.

Sighing, she walked slowly towards the door. She didn't want to linger in the dressing room, painfully conscious of the contrast between the other girls' bright and pretty costumes and her own ultrasevere, dark, tailored suit.
Janice Foy, carefully pinning blond curls, looked up as Dixie passed her. "All ready, already?"
"I'll do. I'm supposed to look a mess, you know." Dixie answered ironically.
Janice laughed. "But you don't. It'd take more than a tight hairdo and thick glasses and mannish clothes, to make a mess of anyone as good-looking as you. You know that!"
Peggy Morrow, eyebrow pencil poised, turned round to say in a careful, low tone, "So do other people. Including Mavis Finley."
"Thanks, chums. You're such comforts." Dixie smiled. She paused to zip up the back of Peggy's silver-sequined frock, then went on out of the room and wandered upstairs.
A lot it helps, she thought, to be pretty! Clyde never sees anyone but Mavis . . . not that she ever gives him an opportunity. I'll be glad when tonight is over! I'm glad we're only giving two performances! She'd had such dreams, joining the "Lakeville Thespians" . . . . Mavis was in on it. When it came of convincing Mother and Daddy that she'd be ready for dramatics college next fall, to head for a real career. And . . . romantic dreams, concerning Clyde Warren, the junior college's handsome, young, new athletic coach .
Wonderful, tall dreams . . . now fallen as flat as pancakes from yesterday's batter. Because of Mavis Finley!
Well, she might have guessed what Mavis was thinking of when she organized the "Thespians." Everything Mavis ever did was first of all for Mavis. From a diamond-set baby locket on her first birthday to fur coats and airplane trips in her twenties, Mavis had always had everything of the best, and had taken it for granted she always would. She queened it over Lakeville's younger set consistently, snatched the attentions of every attractive young man in town and somehow held them just as long as it pleased her. That had been going on for years.
Not that there was anything wrong cheap or questionable in her behavior. There wasn't. Mavis was charming and talented, an outstanding young woman. The trouble was, simply, that other girls got tired of seeing Mavis lap up all the cream all the time.
DIXIE had never fully understood what a menace Mavis could be to other girls' happiness, until after Clyde Warren came to Lakeville. That was when. The trouble grow up all at once and became a
Page 661 662 woman, head-over-heels in love! And she a mere freshman at the college what chance had she? "The Thespians" had seemed her opportunity. Clyde Warren was joining.

And as Dixie had, all through school, played important parts in plays and on programs and was said to have lots of talent, she thought joyfully that now she'd have a chance to stand out from the crowd, be noticed by the object of her daydreams. She might have guessed that Mavis would have her own ideas as to that! Truth dawned on Dixie after the cast for "Island Idyll" was announced. It was the "Thespians'" first production; Mavis had written the play, she was taking the leading feminine role—Eve Hudson—and Clyde was to play the hero, Adam Rowe. Eve and Adam! Disgusting, Dixie thought. If it had been anyone but Mavis, the town would have buzzed. But Mavis, being above reproach, could get away with—even this! No one, not even Dixie's closest friends, knew how Dixie felt about Clyde. It was as if he occupied a secret shrine down in her heart, too sacred for sharing even a knowledge of its existence. Maybe it would have to be that way forever.... Low in spirit, Dixie wandered among the backstage maze of scenery and props, past the wings, down to the end of the curtain. Pulling its edge back a little, she watched the auditorium filling; people drifting in, in pairs, in parties; trickling down the aisles. She recognized the Finleys, a jovial family group. Her father and mother, quiet but eager. She noticed Steven Taylor, editor RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—OCTOBER 1948 publisher of the town newspaper. Coming in with a distinguished-looking stranger. "Look good?" asked a deep, young voice so close behind Dixie that she jumped. "Oh, I'm sorry—I didn't mean to scare you, Dixie," said Roy Taylor. Roy was Steven's nephew. Dixie felt a little annoyed. How long had Roy been standing behind her? "Take a look," she told him, stepping aside. "It's better even than last night. Lots of folks coming for a second sight." "Why shouldn't they?" he grinned. "We're good, aren't we?" "The best 'Thespians' Lakeville ever had!" Dixie laughed. Admiring him in his formal black-and-white—he was one of Eve's dinner guests in act one—she thought he looked surprisingly mature and attractive. He'll be a handsome man.... Turning suddenly, he smiled at her approval. "Yep, we're well worth seeing twice. Especially," he added quietly, "Eve Hudson's secretary. You know, Dixie, you... Well, you're super!" "Thank you, Roy," Dixie said graciously. She let him take her hand for a shy, gentle squeeze. "Super—in lots of ways!" he murmured. She retorted, "You kid nicely, d'you know it?" And more casually, "It must be almost curtain time." She took another quick peek at the audience. "Did you see your uncle? He's down front, with someone I never saw before." He gave her a queer look. "Dixie, how about a soda or something, and a round or so at Roxy's after the show?" Dixie hesitated. She'd refused him so many times. Since Clyde CURTAIN CALL came into her heart, fellow-freshmen like Roy had seemed mere juveniles.... But Clyde wasn't giving her any tumble; maybe she might as well make Roy happy. "Why, yes, I'd like it," she replied. Funny, the way his face lighted. He had such nice eyes, smoky-gray with bluish sparkles when he smiled. Last time he'd asked for a date and she'd refused, the smile had been so wistful that her conscience had hurt. He deserved a "yes"... Especially, being so nice to her in this get-up! She couldn't resist saying, lightly, "You're brave, Roy. What if I'd forget to quit being Sally Johnson before we step out?" "I'd risk it. You're still the best-looking girl in the play, Dixie. And the best actress. And—I think somebody's going to have a surprise, tonight." BEFORE she could ask him what he meant, there was a stir of activity in the wings, and they hurried away to prepare their entrances. Passing lower left, Dixie saw Mavis in powder-pink lace and pearls, waiting with Clyde for their cues. They were smiling deeply into each other's eyes, and Mavis's were narrowed provocatively. Dixie's heart sank lower. Sally Johnson was supposed to care nothing about clothes; to despise men, to take no interest in social affairs except as she must keep track of Eve's dates. Her many lines were important to the building-up of Eve, but never once allowed Sally to sparkle for Dixie. Once the curtain went up, of course, Dixie's resentment at being so unfavorably cast was forgotten. 663 There wasn't time to think, only to act, she reflected humorously. She moved from cue to cue, remembering to handle her notebooks and pencils convincingly, to make the audience feel she really was the efficient and worshipful—but un-glamorous—secretary, seeing to it that Eve, at least, was appreciated, especially by Adam Rowe. Watching him, Dixie wasn't sure that Clyde had much histrionic ability. Nevertheless, he was wonderful! Island dancers in gorgeous cellophane-grass skirts, silver and gold, entertained Eve's guests; softly chanted, sad island songs accompanied the falling-in-love of Eve and Adam. Island black magic was in the villain's schemings. Island scenery, including an incredibly blue ocean backdrop, provided the setting in which the plot unfolded. But Eve's wardrobe was no island product. It was strictly fashion's latest, right out of Vogue and off the Hollywood silver screen. Lakeville had never seen Mavis more alluring. Lakeville sat on the edges of its collective seats, adoring her. Dixie, underneath her efficient manner and crisp, clear lines, sizzled. The whole thing was so obvious. Why, oh, why didn't Clyde get wise? Why did he, seemingly so smart and adult, fall for Mavis Finley's line of charm like any common fish rising to a baited hook? Scene by scene the drama progressed, the plot quickened, the romance moved along. Mavis quick changed from dinner gown to beach togs, to glamorous lounging robe, to a stunning moss-green afternoon suit. She was exquisite in it, when at the last, all obstacles overcome, she stood in Adam's arms, her shiny 664 
ing golden head tilted back, her lips raised for his kiss. Offstage, Dixie turned her face away, her heart aching anew.
The curtain came down amid thunderous applause. Twice it rose again while the triumphant lovers—now frankly Mavis and Clyde again—bowed and smiled hand-in-hand and the orchestra played "Song of the Islands"; and ushers brought armloads of flowers up the aisle. Then the entire cast grouped themselves downstage for final bows, applause almost bursting the walls.
Down, up, down, up, the curtain swung—and halted in mid-descent. "Thespians" looked puzzledly at each other, as an usher came running up to the stage with a single orchid dripping silver ribbon. He stopped, looking straight at Dixie.... and read from a card: "To Sally Johnson, the Lakeville Herald's selection as 'Island Hell's' best supporting player. Compliments of Steven Taylor, Editor, and Grant Weber, guest critic."
DIXIE had to step out amid a new thunder of applause, to receive her trophy. Her knees were wobbly from surprise and confusion.
"Didn't I tell you? I was sure it would be you!" she heard Roy Taylor whispering. The curtain was down at last; the players crowded around Dixie exclaiming congratulations.
Then the babble subsided with a startling suddenness.

All eyes turned to four persons in the middle of the stage: Mavis, Clyde, Steven Taylor, and the stranger Dixie had noticed earlier.
". . . Nice production, Miss Finley. Your play is cleverly written, too. . . . Oh, and where is your little Sally Johnson? I must meet her. She did a very unusual bit, there . . ."
Enthusiastic hands were thrust into Dixie towards him, voices, eager but subdued, urged her on: "Here she is. It's you he wants, Dixie!"
Dixie found herself among the stellar group in a puzzling unrehearsed epilogue. She still didn't understand what was happening; but she heard Steven Taylor saying, ". . . Dixie, I'm proud to introduce you to my old friend, Grant Weber."
Now it clicked. Grant Weber! Why, of course . . . the New York drama critic! She'd known, vaguely proud, that he was an old friend of Mr. Taylor's. . . . And he'd asked for her—Dixie Allen!
Dumbly she put out her hand to his friendly clasp.
"You were great, Miss Allen. All the way through. It isn't often I see so young an actress make an outstanding role of one so insignificant."
"Why—thank you," Dixie stammered. She saw Mavis Finley's smile grow icy, saw little glints of anger in the author-leading lady's eyes.
"I'm writing Steven a special review for The Herald," Mr. Weber continued, "and there'll be a good mention for you. You aren't, by any chance, thinking of a stage career?"
"Well, I have thought—" Dixie wanted, suddenly, to run away, to hide. She was furious with herself. Stuttering like a child! . . . Well, that was exactly what she felt like—a child!
"Good, good!" said the great CURTAIN CALL Weber. "Look me up when you come to New York. I might be able to help you with some contacts." 
"Oh, thank you—again—" Dixie exclaimed. Mrs. Weber smiled, turned again to Mavis. "If I might offer a suggestion to the playwright, why not build up Sally's part? Show a little more revealingly, her hopeless love for Adam; her loyalty to Eve in spite of her own great longing. As it is, it's a bit too subtle for the average playgoer, I'm afraid. Remedy this—and you can, Miss Finley, you write very cleverly—and I'll be happy to recommend your play to an agent I know..." 
Spotlighted once more, Mavis unfroze immediately. "You're wonderfully kind, Mr. Weber. I—I was thinking something along the same lines you suggest, and you—your comments are very helpful and encouraging. I do appreciate—everything you've said, and—Dixie—well, we all agree with you about her," Mavis concluded archly.
Somehow, after a time, Dixie was back in the dressing room. Excited chatter bubbled around her. "You really were marvelous, Dixie. But it took that brilliant Mr. Weber to make us see just how good—"
Janice was saying, and Peggy interrupted with "It just thrilled me, to see Mavis Finley play second fiddle for once! Another orchid to you, Miss Steal-the-Show!" 
"But I didn't, really. I didn't mean to—" She stopped, aghast. She'd almost given herself away. Because that was the truth: she hadn't meant to. She'd had not t 665 the slightest notion that poor Sally had a hopeless passion for Adam Rowe. It had been Dixie Allen's secret love for Clyde Warren, betrayed through Sally! A fine actress she was! She'd better accomplish some growing-up, and learn to keep her personal emotions under her make-up! Thank goodness, since no one knew the truth, everyone would accept Grant Weber's interpretation. Even—Roy. Roy was smart—and she could thank her lucky stars he wasn't smarter still. Roy had thought she was wonderful all the time—bless him! And he was waiting for her, right now...
"Dixie! Dixie Allen! Come back from that wool-gathering!" Janice's raised voice commanded laughingly. "We're asking a question, you high-hat!"
"What? What? Oh, I'm sorry—" 
"Never mind her," Peggy said. "We were just wondering, Dixie. Are you really going to New York?" 
"Oh, I... Don't know. Someday, maybe. But I like being here in Lakeville. And I'm not eighteen. Yet; I've lots of time, to think about—Broadway." 
"Gee!" said Peggy. "You're so sensible.... I'm afraid, if I were in your place, I'd just up and go."
"Well... Maybe... But there are—things to consider, Peggy. Excuse me if I seem in a hurry, girls, but I've got a date." 
"Oh, a date!" Laughing voices repeated the word, chanted it. "A date, girls. Maybe that explains it!"
Laughing back over her shoulder, Dixie hurried away. She felt young and happy and gay; not a care in the world. It was a wonderful feeling. Just wonderful.
Oquirrh Stake Uses Tree Drawing in Magazine Promotion
Work in this stake are to be congratulated on the beautiful way in which they accomplished their subscription programs, and for their devotion and faithfulness in the "follow-up" work which resulted in a most successful completion of the Magazine project. Thee beautifully designed tree, a photograph of which appears on the opposite page, was used by Oquirrh Stake as an aid in achieving its excellent Magazine subscription percentage rate (113%) for 1947. The tree was designed and painted in lovely pastel tints by Sister Hazel B. Jones on a large piece of heavy cardboard, size 27" x 44/7. The graceful proportions and the unusual beauty of the poster were pleasing factors in securing good will for the Magazine and in interesting the members of the wards in the project. The inscription was written by Martha Lamb, Stake Relief Society President.
One week (October 13-18) was designated by the stake for conducting an intensified subscription campaign. For this purpose the five wards were divided into districts and two members of a specially appointed Magazine committee visited each home in the district. Before leaving on their errands the members of the committees met at working sisters' was willingly provided by Relief Society members not serving on the "calling committees," or renewals were not obtained on the first visit, members of the committees made repeat calls until the fine record of 113 per cent had been secured.

Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, October 1, and October 15, 1888.
"FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ZION AND THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ALL NATIONS"
Lincoln Park: Lincoln Park, in the Northeastern part of Chicago, borders the lake, with many acres and attractive as any the same from whence it originally derived its name. As in other parks, there are rustic seats, shaded by large trees, and the ground is everywhere carpeted with beautiful lawns and flower beds, interspersed with artificial ponds and channels, for the convenience of boaters. But its chief attractions are those of its hot house and its extensive exhibition of wild animals.

In the hot house can be found innumerable tropical plants and flowers, so arranged, according to class and form, as to produce at the same time the most pleasing and instructive appearance.

THOUGHTS OF LIFE AND NATURE

Why do the apple-blossoms,  
On a bright spring day, so quickly fall?  
Only come to show their beauty,  
Then with the breezes fall?

Because Dame Nature calls them  
To the earth's untidy floor.  
For they've lived their time appointed,  
And their blooming time is o'er.

BEAR LAKE STAKE: The Relief Society of the Bear Lake Stake held their Twentieth Semi-annual Conference at St. Charles, July 7th and 8th, 1888, Pres. Julia B. Lindsay presiding. The presidents of the different branches of the Society gave in their verbal reports, which were favorable. Coun. E. Callings made a few remarks, in which she plainly set forth some of the duties pertaining to the Latter-day Saints, and showed the good results of obedience to God's laws.

NOTES AND NEWS: There are four Siamese babies studying in England.
Princess Eugenie of Sweden has sacrificed her family jewels to build a hospital for cripples upon an island off the coast.
The Directors of the Western Pennsylvania Medical College in Pittsburgh, Pa., have declared against the admission of women as students, and refused the applications of six young women.

SOME SERIOUS REFLECTIONS: The true Latter-day Saint will be measurably prepared for whatever may transpire. The great and mighty revolutions, and the distress of the nations at the present time, are things that we have been looking for. We must be of good cheer, keep the commandments of God, and be sure to have the Spirit as our hand to act a double watch over ourselves, that we do not grieve and lose the Holy Spirit, and drift away into unbelief, but prepare ourselves for what is lying before us, which are days of tribulation, and try to avoid that awful whirlpool into which so many have been led, either by a spirit of doubt and unbelief, or because of transgression, and have sunk to rise no more. Those who bear these things in mind, and are watching the signs of the times will be able to discern between truth and error, and accept their trials as needful lessons, that will add to their store of experience, which in a future day will be of great worth.

WOMAN'S SPHERE Ramona W. Cannon

THE originator, in America, of poster-preaching to non-churchgoers is a young Baptist girl, Jo Peterson, who began her campaign eleven years ago in Chicago. She now supervises the monthly distribution of Bible quotations on 40,000 billboard posters, small memory cards, or placards for trains, buses, or streetcars. These go to thirty-seven countries. Some have reached Japan and Germany.

CENSUS officials believe that by 1950 there will be sixty per cent more women between the ages of forty-five and sixty-four employed than there were in 1940—an increase of one and one-half million.

THE annual Girls' State and Girls' Nation activities sponsored by the American Legion Auxiliary give excellent training in democratic government to the young women of America. Intelligent leadership will no doubt result from this enterprise.

THE average life-span of women in the United States at present is 69.5 years.

MRS. EDWIN J. DRYER JR. (Dorothea M.) is a deputy county attorney in Salt Lake, the first woman to hold this position.

TWELVE women dentists, from the Western States and Canada, most of them wives and mothers, attended the convention of Western Dentists, held recently in Salt Lake City. Most unusual profession is that of Mrs. Ellen Ferguson of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who makes ceramic skulls which are exact duplicates of human skulls. They are used by medical students and artists.

[N Shanghai, China, is a bank staffed entirely by women, and said to be the only women's bank in the world. The first depositors were women, though men have now joined the ranks. As low a deposit as ten cents is accepted.

[N a survey of women and men students at Mount Union College, Ohio, the question was asked: Have modern conveniences made it possible for the average woman to bear and rear children and maintain a home properly and at the same time carry on a career in business? Eighty-four per cent of the students said "No." Yet recent statistics show that one out of every ten married women in America is gainfully employed. Does this represent the difference between ideals and practical necessity?

Editorial Vol. 35 October 1948 No. 10 The Meaning of October

AGAIN the autumn season comes with its rich harvest and its tide of red and yellow leaves. The mother in the home is busy with fall sewing, with canning and storage of fruits and vegetables, with making plans for the winter comfort and welfare of her family.

The leisurely and quiet way that autumn comes to the earth is sometimes not reflected in the strenuous days of the homemaker.

Yet there is much of steadfast joy that autumn brings in the return of many of our choicest privileges and responsibilities. To the loyal Relief Society member October brings the inspiration of the regular meetings which give her life inspiration, spiritual strength, and a deep sense of the blessed continuity of that which is precious and worthwhile—the lasting treasures that may be found and retained even in this troubled world.

We return to the sanctuary of the Relief Society room which has meant so much to us; we go back to the joyful privilege of meeting again with women who are united in belief and in purpose. We feel again that comforting sense of belonging, of being active units in a great and growing society—an organization hallowed by more than a century of sisterhood and accomplishment under prophetic direction.

It is our pleasure and our responsibility to lift our hearts and use our hands to build usefulness and spiritual beauty, to join with our sisters in many lands to fulfill the purposes of Relief Society.

By regular attendance at all the meetings we enjoy a continuity of interest and an active participation in a varied program designed to enrich our lives and broaden and beautify our personalities. Sometimes it is not alone the activities which we most enjoy that are most necessary to our development. That we may be truly nourished spiritually, aesthetically, socially, and constructively, we need the well-planned enrichment of all phases of Relief Society work. We need the contributions in words and deeds which our sisters give to us willingly and they need the insight and sympathy which we may have to offer.

The societies which include among the membership older women, and the young mothers, as well, can best achieve the objectives of the organization in group accomplishments and individual growth. Thus the "give-and-take" develops most beautifully in a steadfast circle of united sisterhood.

October is the time for making our plans for the Relief Society year, for beginning our attendance at meetings, and for joining with our many sisters in the privileges and responsibilities of our great organization.

C. The Russells Did Not Go to Church

CHAPTER 3

Edith Russell

ENGLAND is so rarely prodigal of sunshine, I remember that beautiful morning as though it belonged only to yesterday. The sun spilled gold on the dusty windows of the ugly office building to which I daily turned my steps, and a great armada of white clouds sailed before a stiff breeze blowing in from the North Sea. I had no premonition of what the day might hold, beyond the usual galaxy of accounts, ledgers, the bevy of tired, middle-aged women making their contribution to the war effort, and another evening at home, reading before the fire while my mother knitted and waited expectantly for Antony's step on the path. At the office I took off my coat and prepared for the day.

The sunshine lighted up the faces of my "school" of women; there were some eager and animated, others who were anxious and old. I knew how it felt when letters from the front were delayed. As I smiled and said "Good morning," the door of the classroom opened to admit the elderly person of the office manager followed by a younger and vigorous man in his late twenties.

"Good morning, Miss Russell," the manager said. "Please to meet Mr. Gregory Miner, late of the King's Own Royal Rifles. I wish you would be good enough to give him some insight as to the function of your school. He is to learn the business and will need to know."

Mr. Miner bowed. He was possessed of a fine healthy color, a somewhat stocky physique, and he exuded an atmosphere of fastidious cleanliness. I liked him at once, and as soon as the manager had retired, I gave him into the charge of a nice homely matron, at whose desk I could conveniently observe and instruct him.

I was near enough to see that on his left hand he wore a most peculiar ring—a great silver Indian head—a rather vulgar trinket, I thought, on the person of an Englishman. It flashed in the sunlight and I wondered why he wore it and from where it came. It seemed a trifle incongruous compared to the quiet conservative quality of the rest of his appearance.

A little before lunch I approached his desk to inquire after his progress.

"The ring flashed silver in the morning sun, and, smiling, he covered it with his hand. I smiled, too.

"What an unusual ring!" I remarked, and he lifted it for my examination.

"But here is one even more unusual," he volunteered, and from his pocket he withdrew a dull gold object, shaped like a shield and covered with peculiar hieroglyphics I could not understand. It was not vulgar like the Indian head, but apparently this was not valued for its ornamentation, but for something deeper and more significant.

"This ring," said Gregory Miner, "I won for achieving."

"Indeed?" I replied, "What exactly do you mean—achieving? Achieving what?"

REGORY Miner seemed to inhale a deep breath. "Miss Russell," he said, and his eyes looked directly into mine, "what do you think of a Church which has for one of its maxims, 'The glory of God is intelligence?'"

The room, filled with thirty women industriously engaged with accounts and figures, endured one of its rare moments of silence. I could hear the old office clock ticking on the wall and for some reason I thought of time and its relation to eternity. I had a momentary and entirely incomprehensible vision of the vicarage at St. Matthews and a woman called Hannah Shuttleworth with her illegitimate child, then a peculiar sensation of warmth suffused my whole being, the same one feels on beholding an old and intimate friend with a familiar greeting on his lips.

I gave Gregory Miner look for look.

"I knew I wasn't wrong," he said, and my heart gave a great bound as though for a moment it had almost ceased to beat for fear I should give any other answer but this. Gregory Miner smiled, too, also with relief.

"I knew I wasn't wrong," he said. "What Church is this to which you refer?"

I wanted to know. "The Church of Jesus Christ of RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—OCTOBER 1948 No? You have Well, then the He Latter-day Saints. Not heard of it? Mormon Church, perhaps?" regarded me quizzically.

I believe I made a reply, but actually I was no longer in that dusty office schoolroom. I was six years removed, watching Michael, my brother, waiting for him to pick up a book my mother had forbidden; a book in which were lurid tales about a strange people called Mormons.

That evening I was home late for dinner. The hungry Antony whooped for joy when I entered the cottage, but my mother was concerned lest my delay had been occasioned by anything disastrous.

"Of course not, darling," I reassured her, as we sat down. "As a matter of fact—"

I was magnificently offhand—

"As a matter of fact, I have been talking to a Mormon in town."

"You have been—what?" Horror expressed itself in every line of my mother's features.

Antony helped himself to more vegetables and inquired: "You mean he was in a circus, or something?"

I could feel my mother's eyes fixed upon me, but I avoided them and waived Antony's question.

"He is a very charming fellow, Mother," I said anxiously. "I feel sure he is perfectly respectable. He is being taught the business at the office. And he—he has only one wife."

I was concentrating upon the food on my plate. I heard my mother say in a cold, shocked voice: "How do you know?"

I took a deep breath.

"Because I asked him," I said, and my face burned at the memory. I was dreadfully conscious—that somewhere in this innocent conversation THE RUSSELLS DID NOT GO TO CHURCH lay an issue so great I was afraid even to contemplate it.

I lifted my eyes to meet those of my mother.

A "Perhaps Antony will bring in the dessert," she said, "I think we have all had enough of _ this course."

Miserably, I looked at her face. How I hated to feel her disapproval. Why did I not simply laugh and tell her that if I met a thousand Mormons, it was a matter of no consequence? Why? Why? Why?

THE NEXT few weeks passed in a strange atmosphere of discovery. The young Mr. Miner was an assiduous missionary. Every day brought new explorations into the strange new world of religion. There were obstacles, of course, mental and aesthetic obstacles; a Prophet who was an American; who spoke in the same idiom as that of the cinema, and other facts at first disconcerting to me.

And, always, on the face of the

I told her, one evening, that I would be baptized. She said nothing at first, think you might—come to 'the Church and see me—see me baptized?"

Her look froze me.

Come to see you baptized," she said with such "I didn't do want 673 I will have no part in it.

Ever since I am ashamed of you now. I don't wish to refer to the matter again, have written to Michael as I feel he should know." I went out and walked through the village, up the hill towards beautiful old St. Matthews. It lay there, the Gothic beauty church struck me afresh, seemed to address itself to me in a poignant appeal. But it isn't any use, I gave answer. You only have a part of the truth. I love—and always shall—your turrets and your bells, and your windows—but I can't feed the soul of me on these alone. That's why I'm leaving you—for something whole and complete. I came to you, once, looking for God—remember? I found him—in part. But I'm greedy. A part isn't enough. So—I'm following my Star... 0

A week later, the day of my baptism dawned. I was to be baptized in the afternoon at three, and in the morning, at the office, Mr. Miner asked me concerning my mother. "She will be in church to see you baptized," he assured me, confidently. I laughed, derisively. He didn't know my mother. He didn't know that the Russells did not go to church. He had no conception of the extent of my disloyalty.

674

Luncheon, at home, that day, was an awkward session. Excitement had taken away my appetite, but I strove to eat so as not to irritate my mother further. Antony, intrigued by thoughts of someone having the temerity to "duck" his sister, asked embarrassing questions throughout the meal. But at last it was over. I escaped to my room and put the few things I should need into my bag. I could hear my mother dressing in her room. "I'm going, Mother!" I called. "Goodbye!" Her voice, a little strained and unfamiliar, came back to me. "Wait for me! I'm going into the city, too. We may as well go together." She appeared a moment later, and without further conversation, we went out into the street where the bus was waiting. The vehicle was very full and, though we sat together, we did not talk. My thoughts were filled with the wonder of what was going to happen to me. A part of me ached for the sweet woman beside me, but withal, I was gloriously happy.

RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—OCTOBER 1948

As the Church came into view, I rose to my feet and turned to my mother. "Goodbye, darling..." She, too, was on her feet. '"Mumsie, where�?" "Hurry," she said. Stopping." A moment later, we stood together on the pavement—a pavement suddenly paved with gold. The bus swung away, Citywards. '"Mumsie—where are you going?" Incredulity was in my voice. A sob, too, I couldn't help it. I didn't care. "Going?" Incredulity was in my mother's voice, too. "Why? I'm going to Church!" Bless her dear heart, she was as surprised as I was! "But�" I was staring, dumfounded. "I know—the Russells." My mother actually laughed and the sound rang in my heart like a peal of bells. She slipped the little bag I carried from my grasp. In it lay a precious white gown and a missionary's copy of the Book of Mormon. "We'd better hurry," she said. "or we're going to be late." "The bus is ���"

CYCLE

Grace M. Candland

The year is growing old;
The hazy autumn sky
Is pathway for the flight
Of geese and blue winged teals' departing cry.

They seek a warmer clime,
Each from his tattered nest
Down in the icy marsh
And reeds along the lake
At winter rest.

And we who watch them go
On strong and steady wing
Will hear their eerie call
From dim horizons break
In early spring.

FEW THINGS ARE CONSTANT

Mabel Jones Gabbott

The late rose petals, curled along the edge,
Are brown and fallen, like sweet, fragrant rain;
Where once we walked beside the garden hedge
Only thorns and brittle stalks remain.
The wind laughs in the locust tree and shakes
The crescent pods of seeds, sunburnt and dry;
The limbs are bare; no more the green leaf makes
Its lacy pattern on the summer sky.

And now along the river where we walk
The star-shaped snowflakes fall and instantly
Are melted; whirled by water, reed, and rock,
Are lost forever, running to the sea.
Few things on earth are constant; beauty dies,
But love like ours will live beyond these skies.

MIGRANTS

Marvin Jones

Wild white days and snow geese flying,
Quivering lines of phantoms crying;
Bronze October—migrant weather—
Birds are wind, snow is a feather.
Wind and geese sing to a rover,
Pagans calling, wheeling over—
Go my heart and still your crying,
Go where winds and geese are flying....

OTHERS MAY LAMENT

Dorothy J. Roberts

No death is here though leaves of autumn drift
Earthward through the leaning aisles of light.
Some unseen element with wings will lift
Their weightless beauty with unfailing might.
Others may lament that autumn dies,
Seeing summer tarnish on a path of stone,
But something in my heart turns Easter wise,
Knowing earth can merely claim her own.

When cold breath from the canyon's mouth is starting
And maples torch the senses with their cry,
Death is not here, but only nature parting
The summer union of the earth and sky.

Questing Lights

Bell Watson Anderson

Chapter 7 Synopsis: Andrew Rumgay leaves his mother and his fiancée Jane Allison in Scotland and joins his friend Hugh Shand to emigrate to America. They meet Mother MacKinlay' and her son Bob, whom they had known while doing missionary work, and become acquainted with Kathleen Coleman and her friend Margaret Purvis. Hugh and Kathleen are married on board the ship. While in Iowa preparing for the handcart journey across the plains, Margaret tells Mother Mac that she is in love with Andrew, and Kathleen tells the two women that she is expecting a baby. While crossing the plains, Andrew is lost in a blizzard and is rescued by Margaret. She later leaves the Macs and goes to live in Tooele. The others later arrive in Zion. Kathleen and Hugh have a son and name him Mac Coleman Shand. Andrew farms and saves money to bring his family from Scotland. When he finally sends it, he receives news that Jane has married someone else. Andrew is a grieved and lonely man and he sends for his small brother and sister instead.

FROM the very first day Andrew went to see the Hunters, he had been interested in wool—it may have been because his mother worked in it at home. When the snow was too deep for timbering he spent his time, after the chores were all completed, carding wool. Sister Hunter made the soap for washing the wool, soaked it in many waters in a vat especially made for that purpose, washed it, rinsed it, and put it out in the shade to dry. After picking and carding the soft white wool into batts for quilts, or spinning it into yarn, she knit the family's underwear, socks, and stockings. Sometimes she dyed the wool into beautiful colors and knit sweaters and fascinators for her daughters and soft warm shawls for herself and friends.

Page 676

With the waste she made rugs for the floor. Many people wanted her to process their wool but she never found time, so Andrew decided wool-processing would be a good business for him. He built a lean-to on the cabin and went to work. He had woven too many dreams into the river bottoms and the forest—dreams which would never be fulfilled—to return to them. Processing wool would be advantageous for a number of reasons. He would be at home to take care of the bairns—his brother and sister—when they arrived. He could catch up with his Church work. He was making up for lost time now.

When there was no special activity planned in the ward, he went out to visit the sick, to encourage and help the poor, and to teach the gospel. He had wanted to build a fence around his lot with the logs which he had cut when he was timbering, but he hadn't found time. Now he decided to finish up a lot of odd jobs around his home.

The bairns came that fall in time for school. They brought love and comfort to their brother's heart, and sunshine to the cabin. He desired his training to be just as profitable to them as had been his mother's love, patience, and sacrifice to him. She had been father and mother to ten, so he felt that surely he could take care of two.

All preparations for the winter were completed. The shelves and root cellar were full of food. His yard was stacked high with good wood to burn. He called on him for a few days at the mill; was asked to go out and talk to the people about buying stock in the factory company. Plans were made to organize a Co-Operative Store in Resplendence.

As Brother Rumgay's responsibility in the bishopric was to look after the young people, he didn't settle long in any one place. Thanksgiving was the end of all winter activities in—people entertained themselves at the meetinghouse. They had programs of various kinds, operas, home dramatics, and dances. Often there were sleigh-riding parties; their favorite entertainment was the supper dance. They would all gather at some home for a hot cooked supper; then they would go to the meetinghouse for a program and dance.

At holiday time they decorated the ward house and planned entertainment for every night in the week between Christmas and New Year's. Mother invited all the Macs to spend the day with her. After dinner, they had a sacred program, in keeping with the occasion. Mother read the Christmas story from the Bible; Hugh led in singing Christmas carols; Brother Coleman played classical music on his violin; the bairns gave a dialogue.

Bob presented a short talk on gifts: "I'm going to tell you how the MacKinlays received their greatest gift of all. My father was the only one in several generations who did not join the dominant church of Scotland. He wanted to wait and join the true Church. One day, father was walking down the streets of Cowdenbeath. A gentle breeze was blowing. It blew a piece of white paper right into father's path. It fell at his feet. He picked it up and read the announcement of a Mormon meeting to be held in Cowdenbeath.

Father attended the meeting and knew from the first the young missionaries were preaching the truth. He studied their literature and prayed to his Heavenly Father and received a strong testimony. He applied for baptism, and soon mother joined him. This is how we received our very greatest gift. It was a wonderful Christmas. New Year's was the day the Scots celebrated in the old country.

Andrew had suffered a lot of bad luck the past year, and Mother was eager to help a wee trifle to bring good luck to him in the new year. She got Bob out of his bed early, and dressed up in Sunday clothes and new shoes, she sent him along to Andrew's with a basket filled to the brim with every good thing to eat.

Andrew insisted on Bob's coming in and eating a bite of breakfast, then he sent Bob back to his mother's with the basket filled to the brim again. No bad luck would visit the Rumgays and MacKinlays—Bob had taken care of that. A dark-complexioned boy—with guid clothes and new shoes, carrying something filled to the brim—brought good luck. Mother felt just a wee bit easier when she thought of Andrew's situation.

Spring came early. The women were doing their housecleaning and their sewing; the men building and repairing fences. The wool business was successful. Andrew, with the help of his brother and sister, Bill and Janet, had more work than they could do. One evening in April all the Macs dropped by Andrew's house for a little visit.

As they were finishing supper, a knock came on the door. Bill answered. It was the bishop, his second counselor, and the ward clerk—Andrew's fellow workers, calling. They talked about the crops and the weather. Then Andrew asked them why they were calling, as only the night before they had met in bishop's meeting.

Andrew was a little curious and a little anxious. He wondered if they intended to release him. The bishop paused thoughtfully for a few moments, then explained, "Brother Rumgay, we are calling you on a mission to Scotland, if it can be arranged. The ward has some missionary funds you would be welcome to use."

"A mission!" Mother exclaimed, "surely, Bishop, you do not joke about such sacred matters." "We are not joking. We were never more serious in our lives. Well, Brother Rumgay, what have you to say?" "A mission!" Andrew spoke slowly, weighing every word. "I hadn't thought about it, but it's what I do want more than anything else in the world. I found something on the plains, something priceless. I would like to share it with my loved ones and friends."

RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—OCTOBER 1948

"We thought as much," returned the bishop. "Now we will leave you to do your planning. It can be worked out."

The Macs were dumfounded. "And Andrew just after telling us he never wanted to cross the plains again," Brother Coleman laughingly expressed himself.

"And the bairns just arrived," Mother added. "Andrew must go on his mission. But how?" the Macs questioned.

Bill and Janet complicated the picture. Their brother wanted them to stay at home and not add more responsibility for Kathleen and Mother. He did not want to take them back to Scotland as they loved the new country and were doing so well in school. Mother studied a long time, and then thought she had the solution.

"Maybe it will work out," she said, "maybe it won't—if it does, it is the one way out and the only way that I can see."

"Don't keep us in suspense, Mother," Andrew anxiously pleaded.

Mother looked around at all her companions. Strange that not one of them had thought about the missing member of the Macs.

"Why Margaret, to be sure. Don't tell me you've all forgotten her." "Margaret," slowly Kathleen spoke. "That's the most beautiful name and the most beautiful person I have ever known. Oh! I'm getting so lonesome to see her." "That's it," Andrew spoke up quickly, "Margaret is maybe just as lonesome for Kathleen and Mother. If she is, she will come."

QUESTING LIGHTS ARGARET was very anxious to see the Macs again. The Stuarts had made her as welcome as one of their own, yet the years had been long and very trying since she parted with the Macs on the plains. She had tried to convince herself that work was the solution to all her problems. If she worked hard enough, eventually it would blot out and she would become interested in new people and new places. She knew now this wasn't true. Her anticipation of meeting the Macs thrilled her as nothing had done since she left them.

Mother and Bob went to Tooele to bring Margaret to Resplendence. The day she arrived had been set apart for celebrating. Mother had insisted on them killing all the pullets, because, after all, she might not be able to buy cayenne pepper. Andrew's missionary party was to be held at the meetinghouse that night.

Margaret helped Kathleen cook the supper, setting the table with Mother's best dishes. She wore a pale blue dress with a fitted basque, full sleeves, and a long billowy skirt. The basque had a curved neckline and a vestee of fine, cream-colored lace. Her long black hair was plaited and wrapped around her head. She wore her mother's cameo, gold and black earrings, and lovely flowers in her hair.

Mother Mac's description of her was perfect—slim and trim. The door opened and Andrew walked in. "Margaret, let me look at you, young lady! Why, you're beautiful! Twice as beautiful as you were when you left us on the Plains. You're good, too! Thanks 679 for 'making my mission possible,' I am sure the Lord will know it is your contribution as well as mine," Andrew spoke from a full heart.

"I wanted you to go on your mission, Andrew. It is your opportunity to offer our kinsmen the gospel, with the wonderful blessings we have all received," Margaret spoke quietly. "It took a lot of faith and courage to accept a mission when I had a young brother and sister to take care of, but the bishop said it could be arranged, and now it is. The bairns are going to love you, Margaret! I hope you can learn to love them."

"I'm sure I can," she said. "Leave it to us and the Lord." "Oh, Margaret, you are wonderful!" Hugh called on Andrew regarding a detail of the program for his farewell party. While they talked, Margaret sat beside Mother Mac and covertly studied the face of Andrew. He had not been well when she left him on the plains, but she was hardly prepared for what she saw in him tonight.

A spirit of righteous indignation rose in her heart against Jane Allison. Andrew was pale and nervous, yet she was sure the Macs hadn't noticed it because he had managed every day to do his full share of all the work. Margaret believed that God had called Andrew on this mission, and she decided that there would be no home worries for the young man while he was away. She would take care of that.

Margaret bowed her head and silently prayed that Andrew would be brought safely back to her.

She remembered the tree in tears on the plains and wiped her eyes.
They all had a wonderful time at the party which was planned like the Scotch entertainment on shipboard. Janet and Bill danced the "Highland Fling" and "Sword Dance."
Andrew was different tonight—very different. He was happy, more like his old self than he had been in months. His friends thought it was the mission. He had the Macs wondering.
The bishop was anxious for Andrew to get started on his way to Scotland. It had been a long time since a missionary had left Resplendence, but Andrew waited while the bairns became acquainted with Margaret (because she wanted it that way), and Margaret became acquainted with the wool.
But before many months the young man was calling for his mail at King's Kettle.

WALK WITH ME
Evelyn Fjeldsted

I am going for a walk today; Will you come along with me?  
To follow trails through pasture lands And rest beside the old pine tree;  
Out where wild rose seed pods shine Like rubies in the sun's blue light—  
Where limpid streams move listlessly And blackbirds whir in sudden flight;  
Where burnished sheaves from stacks that rise Like heaps of gold—a priceless yield?  
Let us lose our cares, just for today And glean the beauty of the field.

AUTUMN NIGHT
Marijane Morris

Tonight there is a shadow stealth  
Upon the huddled harvest fields.  
The corn leaves fall again tonight With waiting, silent fodder shields.  
Above discordant, honking geese, The moon is gowned in garnered gold.  
She floats beyond the windmill's vanes, The clutch both firm and deathly cold.  
Tonight there is a death abroad, A crackling, necromantic time,  
While harvest golds and crimsons die A startled death too soon . . . too soon.

Who does this bloom of summer go When autumn leaves dance in the air?  
Does earth take back what she has borne To gladden hearts some otherwhere?

Braided Rugs Are Beautiful
Delma Peterson

Relief Society women have many hobbies which give them the satisfaction of personal accomplishment and the joy of helping others. Some of these hobbies appeal particularly to women who love to make their homes beautiful and at the same time exercise their capabilities in being masters of the ways of thrift. Marie C. Jacobsen of Richfield, Utah, has turned her artistic abilities and her homemaking skill to a most pleasing and useful hobby. She makes braided rugs—not just the ordinary hit-and-miss, hurry-up kind—but works of art which reveal color harmony and expert workmanship. She makes large rugs and small rugs, round rugs and oval ones—rugs suitable for any and every room in the house. She has made two large tugs, twelve feet in diameter, and numerous small ones. And what is more pleasing in a home than a shining polished floor set off with a large, colorful braided rug—or more charmingly useful than a small rug placed where many footsteps pass?

In the first place, in her rug making activities, Mrs. Jacobsen uses only materials that are not required or necessary for other purposes. Many articles, such as old bedspreads, cushion covers, draperies, which many women discard, may appear as new and colorful strands in a rag rug, especially when faded colors are dyed into rich, bright tints. Using four strands of rags, Mrs. Jacobsen sews the various lengths together with strong thread as she braids, carefully selecting colors for harmony and the weights and widths of strands which will work in evenly. There is a very special "knack" of holding the strands at the proper tension, not too loose and not too tight, so that the rug, when finished, will lie flat.

Mrs. Jacobsen, wife of M. O. Jacobsen, and mother of two children, was born in Denmark in 1878 and came with her parents to America in 1888. She has lived in Richfield for thirty-nine years, actively serving Relief Society and lending her support to Church and community projects which have uplifted and benefited the community. During the war, Mrs. Jacobsen used another of her hobbies to advantage—she knit for the Red Cross eighty pairs of bed socks and twenty-five sweaters. 'Truly it can be said of her, she "eateth not the bread of idleness."

SELECTED DATA
Annual Report – 1947
Margaret C. Pickering, General Secretary-Treasurer

The following pages illustrate the record of service and achievement of Relief Society for 1947—the one hundredth anniversary of the Church's home in the West. We are pleased to include reports from the Czechoslovakian, East German, and Netherlands Missions, the first received since 1938, due to war conditions.

The following brief summary shows the membership trends in twenty-five year periods:

During the first twenty-five years (1847-1872) Relief Society work was carried on by a few scattered organizations. In 1867 Brigham Young instructed all bishops to establish Relief Societies in their wards and by 1872 the membership had reached approximately 10,000.

During the following twenty-five years (1872-1897) stake units were created (the first being in Weber in 1877). Interest in Relief Society work was stimulated generally so that by 1897 the membership had reached about 20,000.

During the period 1897-1922 uniform courses of study and regular weekly meetings were established which greatly accelerated growth to a membership of 53,412.

From 1922 to 1947 the society achieved its major growth as noted in the accompanying chart, a peak of 115,015 being attained in 1941 in anticipation of Relief Society's Centennial in 1942. From 1942 to late 1945 many women were engaged in war work which prevented them being active in Relief Society, but during 1946, the first postwar year, the membership increased 4107, and in 1947, Utah's Centennial year, the membership increased 6,045, a ten per cent increase in two years, making a total of 111,843 members at the end of 1947. This increase in membership is a welcome and heartening attainment and the corresponding increase in all phases of Relief Society work is equally gratifying.

The outstanding activity of 1947 was the launching of the fund-raising program for a Relief Society building to be erected as a permanent home for the organization in Salt Lake City. The plan, announced at the annual Relief Society conference in October, is to be completed in one year.

Following the Nauvoo period, from a small nucleus in Utah and neighboring territories the organization has spread over much of the civilized world. With the establishment of new stakes and new missions and the re-opening of foreign missions, Relief Society looks forward to sharing its blessings and benefits with increasingly greater numbers of women in many lands.

To all Relief Society workers, past and present, whose vision and devotion have made possible Relief Society's notable achievement of the past one hundred years the present general board expresses its sincere appreciation and deep gratitude.

ANNUAL REPORT – 1947
TRENDS in the accompanying chart show the growth of Relief Society during its 100 years in the West. Following an intensive membership campaign in 1941, when a sudden peak of 115,015 members was reached, there was a decline.

ANNUAL REPORT – 1947

In 1946 membership resumed its steady growth commensurate with the increase in Latter-day Saint families—heading toward the goal of every Latter-day Saint woman a member.
The percentage of members active in leadership indicates the strength and vitality of any organization. Note that while leadership activity obviously could not keep pace with the sudden growth in 1941, its ratio to membership otherwise has been maintained.

LESSON DEPARTMENT Theology�The Life and Ministry of the Savior Lesson 12�'Peace Be Still' Elder Don B. Colton (Reference: Jesus the Christ, Chapter 20, by Elder James E. Talmage) For Tuesday, January 4, 1949 Objective: To strengthen faith in the Lord Jesus Christ through the recognition of his power over the forces of nature, of men, and even of demons. Note: All quotations which are not followed by references are taken from the text Jesus the Christ. It is suggested that during the meeting at which this lesson is considered, the members _ sing, "Master, the Tempest Is Raging," Deseret Sunday School Songs, page 204. Toward evening on the day that Jesus had first used parables in his teaching, he suggested to his disciples that they cross to the east side of the Sea of Galilee. No doubt, he was weary and wanted to get away from the multitudes for awhile. Before the trip commenced a certain scribe said unto Jesus, "... Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest" (Matt. 8:18). It was a plain bid for official recognition on the part of one of the ruling class. However, Jesus does not call those to office who seek positions. His policy was announced on another occasion as, "Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you..." (John 15:16). He had thus chosen the Twelve. The offer of the scribe was not accepted. While the gospel is for all, those who officiate in its sacred work must be called of God. In two other instances on that day the Lord taught great lessons concerning the need for a willingness to sacrifice on the part of those who accept calls to the ministry. One man who had volunteered to follow the Master if permitted first to go home and bury his father, was told, "... Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God." Another man who wanted to be a disciple requested time to go home and bid farewell to his friends. "And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God" (Luke 9:57-62). In both cases, the answers may seem harsh. However, the Lord knew what was in their hearts. The work of the ministry was largely spiritual. Let those who were spiritually dead or negligent bury the dead. Those who had been set apart to the service of the Master had pressing duties to perform.
LESSON DEPARTMENT Stilling the Storm
Let us return now to the trip
across the lake. Some of the multitude
tried to follow, in small boats,
the ship in which Jesus set sail. He
found a place near the stern of the
small vessel and soon fell asleep. It
is well known that violent storms
frequently arise on the Sea of Galilee.
On this occasion, a great storm
soon overtook the ship in which the
journey was being made. Jesus was
subject to fatigue and on this night
slept soundly. His day's work was
done, he could sleep. Soon, however,
the frightened disciples awakened
him with the cry, "Lord, save us: we perish"; and, "Master, carest thou not that we perish?" Their terrified appeal was not wholly devoid of hope nor barren of faith:
And he saith unto them, "Why are ye fearful? . . . How is it that ye have no faith?" Times we wonder why we cannot have more faith. It is comforting to know that others have cried, "Lord save us." It is still more comforting to know that even now he hears us. If only we could have more faith, the winds and waves of our troubled souls would be still. Lord, teach us to have more faith.
This miracle of the Christ has
caused more comment, perhaps, than
any other. It does prove he has control
over the forces of nature.
For by him were all things created, that
are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible
and invisible, whether they be thrones,
or dominions, or principalities, or powers:
all things were created by him, and for
him: . . . For it pleased the Father that
in him should all fulness dwell (Col. 1:16,
19).
The Lord does, and will have
complete control over the earth itself.
Paul states:
Because the creature itself [meaning the
earth] also shall be delivered from the
bondage of corruption into the glorious
liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groaneth
and travaileth in pain together until now
(Romans 8:21-22).
There are many references in the
scriptures to a time when the elements
will be melted by fire and
the earth will pass away and we will
have a new earth. This change is
likened unto a transfiguration
(D. & C. section 63:20-21. See also
section 88:25-27). Jesus is the God
of this land (Ether 2:12). He created
this earth, under the direction
of his Father, and, therefore, does
speak to the winds, the sea, and
everything in the earth, and they
Quieting the Demons
Shortly after the stilling of the
storm, Jesus and his party landed on
the eastern side of the lake. Matthew
tells us (8:28-29) that, as they
landed, "there met him two
possessed with devils." One of them,
especially, terrified the neighborhood
with his weird shrieks. Because
of his mania, he was so strong he
had broken his fetters and fled to
the mountains where he lived in
the caves. However, when he saw
the Lord, he prostrated himself and
cried: "What have I to do with thee,
Jesus, thou Son of the most high
God?" (Mark 5:7). Notice how
the devils recognized the Master.
CHRIST RAISING THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS Page 698 LESSON DEPARTMENT ". . . the devils also believe, and tremble" (Jas. 2:19). The demons by whom the man was possessed recognized the Lord. They had known him before that day. They knew that some time Satan will be "bound and cast into the bottomless pit" for a thousand years.
On this occasion Jesus inquired, "What is thy name?" The reply is significant, "My name is Legion: for we are many" (Mark 5:9). The devils implored that they be not banished. They were given permission to enter the bodies of swine and did so; and the whole herd of hogs�about two thousand�stampeded and ran into the sea and were drowned. To see the once-wild man restored to health, and to hear what happened, greatly astounded the people. They were afraid of the Lord and pleaded with him to leave their country.

Wicked people could not stand to be in his presence, if they could avoid it.
The man who had been healed, or rid of the demons, was told by Jesus to go to his friends and tell them the great things the Lord had done for him. The man was full of gratitude and became a missionary. Wherever he went he told of the marvelous things Jesus had done for him.
In this one short journey across the Sea of Galilee many mighty works had been done. He had shown his power over the elements, had cast out demons, and had called at least one grateful, efficient missionary.
The Raising of the Daughter of Jairus
When the Lord returned to Capernaum, great crowds of people were waiting for him. As soon as he landed, Jesus was asked by Jairus, one of the local rulers among the Jews, to go and lay hands upon his sick daughter. Said Jairus, ". . . My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live" (Mark 5:23). This father, though a ruler, came with faith and trust. His only daughter, a girl of twelve years, was dying, "is even now dead," he said.
On the road to the home of Jairus a very unusual incident occurred. The people thronged about Jesus. In the crowd was a woman who had been sorely afflicted for twelve years. Doctors had been unable to cure her. She pushed her way through the crowd and touched his robe. She said, "If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole." She tried to withdraw unnoticed but Jesus turned and asked, "Who touched me?" Peter replied, "Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?" The Lord said, "Somebody hath touched me; for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me." The woman, notwithstanding her fear, came forward and kneeling before the Lord confessed that it was she. He assured her in kindly tones that her faith had made her whole. A study of this incident convinces us that the power to heal was inherent in the Lord Jesus to be "exercised at his will, and as the influence of faith might call it forth." Let us remember his saying "Thy faith hath made thee whole" (Luke 8:43-48).
Remember, the woman was healed as Jesus was on the road to the house of Jairus. Jairus had shown no impatience at the delay. He trusted the Lord. Even before they reached the home, word reached them that the little girl was dead. Jesus spoke reassuringly to the father, "Be not afraid, only believe." Only three of the apostles, Peter, James, and John, and the parents, were permitted to go with the Lord into the death chamber. Taking the young girl by the hand he said to her, "Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise." The girl arose and was well. Jesus directed that food be given her as her body needed it. This, it must be remembered, was a case of calling back to life from death, not a case of resurrection (Mark 5:35-43).
Restoration of Life and Resurrection
There is a vital distinction between restoring from death to life and a resurrection of the body to a condition of immortality. Jesus was "the first fruits of them that slept." He was the first being ever to be resurrected. In all instances prior to his resurrection, the reuniting of the spirit and body was merely a commutation of mortal existence. Jesus controls both life and death. Faith in him brings the desired blessing: Passive belief on the part of a would-be recipient of blessing is insufficient; only when it is vitalized into active faith is it a power; so also of one who ministers in the authority given of God, mental and spiritual energy must be operative if the service is to be effective.
Space will not permit giving in this lesson more of the miracles of the Lord. He opened the eyes of the blind, and caused them to see. He healed those who were deaf and those who were defective of speech. It is interesting to note that in these instances Jesus ministered by some "physical contact in addition to uttering the authoritative words of command or assurance." He anointed one man's eyes with clay; on the eyes of another he applied saliva; he put his fingers into the ears of another, or touched the tongue, as the case needed. He healed by a power that was his own. In this, our day, he has directed that we anoint with holy, consecrated oil as did the apostles of old (Mark 6:13).
Questions and Suggestions for Discussion
1. Why are self-seeking persons not appointed to office in the Church?
2. Describe the miracle of Christ stilling the tempest.
3. Give quotations to prove that faith is the great power by which miracles are performed.
4. Give an account of the woman being healed by touching the garment of Jesus and of the restoration to life of the daughter of Jairus.

Visiting Teachers' Messages�Our Savior Speaks Lesson 4�In the World Ye Shall Have Tribulation: But Be of Good Cheer Elder H. Wayne Driggs
For Tuesday, January 4, 1949
Objective: To give encouragement to face the coming year courageously,
The turn of the year we might well recall these words spoken by the Savior: "In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer." What cheer can there be in tribulation? How can one take comfort in the thought of misery or suffering? Can it be that life to be good must also be evil?
For one who has not lived understandingly, under the promptings of the "spirit," these questions seem unanswerable. Today, through the light of modern scriptures, we may know, however, that there is real purpose in life. That even the bitter experiences in living can add the somber tones which but serve to highlight the brighter joys.
What true Latter-day Saints must learn to see in day-by-day patterns, is their ultimate goal. Again and again in the Book of Mormon we read words of understanding and encouragement explaining the seeming paradoxes of life. "But behold," says Lehi, "all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things. Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:24-25). When we learn this lesson then "joy" like "cheer" reflects the deeper significance.
'The sacrifice of parents for children, the long road to relieve a suffering friend, the bittersweet hours that slip away in the passing of a loved one—these, and the myriads of other hard moments that crowd a full life, can only be sustained by an unfaltering trust in the Master's over-all purposes.

By living righteously we may be of good cheer both in the present and in the future, sustained by the knowledge that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that all things work out for our ultimate good. Thus, though tribulation must be with us here, we realize its darker side is towards the earth, not heaven. "In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer" (John 16:33).

Work Meeting - Sewing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting)
Lesson 4 - Salvage from Shirts Jean Ridges Jennings

For Tuesday, January 11, 1949

EN'S shirts, like their suits, frequently become shabby and wear out in strategic points long before their full value is exhausted. The collars and cuffs become frayed and they frequently pull out at the armholes, but the main body of the shirts can still stand more wear. If the material seems weak all over, then it is a waste of time and energy to remake them. But when the shirt as a whole is sturdy, many useful things can be done with it. There is a surprising amount of yardage to be found in a man's shirt. The fabric is usually fine, soft, and closely woven. These features, together with attractiveness of color and print, recommend them for remodeling into children's clothes.

Logically, the first use that comes to mind is merely re-making the shirt into a smaller size for a boy. In this case try to take advantage, as much as possible, of the tail of the shirt which gets the least wear, for the parts of the boy's shirt which get the most wear, namely the collar and sleeves. Other children's clothing such as sun suits, pinafores and aprons can be constructed from shirts, colored ones being used for play clothes for little girls, and for play trousers, with a bib, for little boys. Attractive butcher-boy smocks, to be worn with contrasting slacks can be fashioned for little girls, using the stripes in different directions for trim. For the teen-age girl lovely blouses can be made in the Gibson girl styles. Many attractive combinations can be fashioned by using plain white shirts along with striped or colored ones.

Have a _ tucked white bosom front and cuffs and collar on a solid color blouse. Or reverse the procedure and have striped trim on a white blouse. The young housewife and mother can fashion innumerable useful and attractive aprons. A shirt lends itself better to a style with a waist band and attached bib or merely a front apron type, since the usable length of a shirt is rarely over thirty inches. By combining the available material of the shirt with color, bias, rick rack or even eyelet embroidery, the possibilities are unlimited.

To this list of suggestions add numerous items such as sunbonnets for the little girls, petticoats, panties, and even the popular camisole, and we have a vista of make-overs to challenge the ingenuity of any clever woman.

LESSON DEPARTMENT 703

Literature - Literature of the Latter-day Saints
Literature of the Gospel Restoration. Lesson 4 - Words of Light and Truth from the Prophet Elder Howard R. Driggs

For Tuesday, January 18, 1949

Joseph Smith was the first great interpreter in these latter days of the gospel, which with the help of the Lord and Savior, of Moroni and other holy men, he restored. In addition to the Book of Mormon, which he said is "the keystone of our religion," and the Doctrine and Covenants which is the revealed word of God to this Prophet, there are many sayings and sermons of this great leader which add new light and truth. These help us understand more clearly the plan of salvation; and further, they bring us closer to the spirit and power and kindly nature of "the man who communed with Jehovah."

In a helpful little book called Joseph Smith's Teachings - a compilation by Edwin F. Parry from the authorized History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, known as the Documentary History of the Church (D. H. C.), are many illuminating utterances of the Prophet - taken from his sermons and informal discussions, as nearly as his scribes in longhand could record his words.

In this study let us center attention on some of these typical selections to get not only spiritual upbuilding, but also for appreciation of the direct, vibrant, lucid style in which the great leader portrayed truth and wisdom.

An excellent first example - and this came from his pen - will be found in our "Articles of Faith." For straightforward, orderly composition - clear, concrete, and comprehensive - this religious statement is outstanding. Moreover, the language has a natural rhythm which lends itself to good oral reading and memorizing. In a word, the "Articles of Faith" have high literary quality.

Joseph Smith wrote and spoke without ostentation. He wasted no words; truth to him was of first importance. Further, he seemed to delight, as the prophet Nephi tersely expressed it, "in plainness."

Further examples of the plain and forceful words of Joseph Smith follow:

Baptism of Water and the Spirit

The gospel requires baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, which is the meaning of the word in the original language - namely, to bury or immerse: We ask the sects, Do you believe this? They answer, No. I believe in being converted. I believe in this tenaciously. So did the Apostle Peter and the disciples of Jesus. But I further believe in the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands.... You might as well baptize a bag of sand as a man, if not done in view of the remission of sins and getting of the Holy Ghost.

Baptism by water is but half a baptism, and is good for nothing without the other half - that is, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. The Savior says, "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" (Joseph Smith's Teachings, pp. 15-16).

704

Faith and Its Fruits

Faith comes by hearing the word of God. If a man has not faith enough to do one thing, he may have faith to do another: if he cannot remove a mountain, he may heal the sick. Where faith is there will be some of the fruits; all gifts and power which were sent from heaven, were poured out on the heads of those who had faith (Ibid., page 38).

Constitution of the United States - Its One Fault

It is one of the first principles of my life, and one that I have cultivated from my childhood, having been taught it by my father, to allow every one the liberty of conscience. I am the greatest advocate of the Constitution of the United States there is on the earth. In my feelings I am always ready to die for the protection of the weak and oppressed in their just rights.

The only fault I find with the Constitution is, it is not broad enough to cover the whole ground. Although it provides that all men shall enjoy religious freedom, yet it does not provide the manner by which that freedom can be preserved, nor the punishment of Government officers who refuse to protect the people in their religious rights, or punish those mobs, states, or communities who interfere with the rights of the people on account of their religion (Ibid., page 24). Here, surely, is literature that was lived before it was written. The Prophet had just gone through the persecutions with his people that brought death to many, imprisonment for himself and others, and expulsion from a State, some of whose officers had violated sacred principles of the Constitution. And he had heard from the Chief Executive of our Nation the weakling words, "Your cause is just; but I can do nothing for you." The expression of the Prophet on the Constitution came out of a full heart.

Another stirring expression, recorded in its burning words for us RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—OCTOBER 1948 by Parley P. Pratt, who heard it, was the Prophet's denunciation of the foul mob who held him with other leaders in a dreadful jail. After he had listened to the filthy boastings and profanity of these captors as long as he could stand it, Joseph Smith rose, and in a voice of thunder said, as neatly as apostle Pratt could recall his words: "Silence, ye fiends of the infernal pit! In the name of Jesus Christ I rebuke you, and command you to be still; I will not live another minute and hear such language. Cease such talk, or you OF J die THIS MINUTE." The story continues: He remained quiet till a change of guards (Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt, page 7).

In another part of his Autobiography, Parley P. Pratt, who knew Joseph Smith intimately during those earlier testing years, writes of the Prophet's language as: "studied—not smoothed and softened by education and refined by art; but flowing forth in its own native simplicity, and profusely abounding in variety of subject and manner." He interested and edified, while, at the same time, he amused and entertained his audience; and none listened to him that were ever weary of his discourse... Even his most bitter enemies were generally overcome, if he could once get their ears (Ibid., page 7).

All this is borne out by the fact that during his brief life he attracted thousands upon thousands through his spiritual teachings. More than this, his profound lessons of "No man is capable of judging a matter, in council, unless his own heart is pure" (Joseph Smith's Teachings, p28-50). A man is saved no faster than he gets 156). There is never a time when the spirit is too old to approach God (Ibid., page 105).

"There is no such thing as immaterial matter. I fine or pure, and can by purer eyes" (Ibid., page 104).

"Daily transgression and daily repentance is not that which is pleasing in the sight of God" (Ibid., page 136).

"God judges men according to the use they make of the light which He gives them" (Ibid., page 161).

Examples of effective expression. Joseph Smith thought boldly, and voiced plainly truth as he had gained it with divine guidance. He had a message of deep import to give to the world—had religious fallacies to correct; and he did it courageously in plain language: "One thing he did that needed doing and still does, was to take the sectarian fancy off heavenly beings; artists had mis-pictured them; authors had written wrongly of them. Joseph Smith said with characteristic directness: 'An angel of God never has wings.' This point is emphasized because there seems to be need of correcting the fallacy."

"Why," said an adolescent Latter-day Saint girl recently, "I always thought that angels had wings." With pictures spread by millions at Christmas, Easter, and on other occasions, portraying the error, it is high time to guard our buying, and help our children to learn the truth. Our Prophet, with words of clarity and concreteness, performed a divine service in bringing heaven closer to us. He truly re-vitalized Christianity; he brought us closer to angels. He knew them as glorious human beings, for Moroni, "an angel from on high," had been his splendid teacher.

With inspired words and in plainness, Joseph Smith taught the pure and everlasting gospel. With clarity and courage he laid bare the fallacies that had grown round it, stripping away the trappings of sectarianism. Nor was there anything narrow or prejudicial in all this. It was always inspired with a desire to spread truth. "We do not ask any people," he said, "to throw away any good they have got; we only ask them to come and get more." Again he said, "One of the grand fundamental principles of 'Mormonism' is to receive truth, let it come whence it may."

All of which is in accord with the Thirteenth Article of our Faith— which came from this Prophet of the latter days. Joseph Smith added richly to the religious literature of the world. He contributed not only many sayings of spiritual worth, but also dissertations on lofty themes to clarify principles of the gospel.

Following are further illustrations, some excerpts from one of such helpful sermons:

"GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST"

Various and conflicting are the opinions of men in regard to the gift of the Holy Ghost. Some people have been in the habit of calling every supernatural manifestation the effects of the Spirit of God, whilst there are others that think there is no manifestation connected with it at all; and that it is nothing but a mere impulse of the mind, or an inward feeling, impression, or secret testimony or evidence, which men possess, and that there is no such thing as an outward manifestation.

It is not to be wondered at that men should be ignorant, in a great measure, of the principles of salvation, and more especially of the nature, office, power, influence, gifts, and blessings of the gift of the Holy Ghost; when we consider that the human family have been enveloped in gross darkness and ignorance for many centuries past, without revelation, or any just criterion to arrive at a knowledge of the things of God, which can only be known by the Spirit of God....

We believe that "no man can know that Jesus is the Christ, but by the Holy Ghost." We believe in it in all its fullness, and power, and greatness, and glory; but whilst we do this, we believe in it rationally, consistently, and scripturally, and not according to the wild vagaries, foolish notions, and traditions of men. The human family are very apt to run to extremes, especially in religious matters, and hence people in general, either want some miraculous display, or they will not believe in the gift of the Holy Ghost at all...

We believe that the Holy Ghost is imparted by the laying on of hands of those in authority, and that the gift of tongues, and also the gift of prophecy are gifts of the spirit; and are obtained through that medium; but then to say that men always prophesied and spoke in tongues when they had the imposition of hands would be to state that which is untrue, contrary to the practice of the apostles, and at variance with holy writ; for Paul says, "To one is given the gift of tongues, to another the gift of prophecy, and to another RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�OCTOBER 1948 the gift of healing;" and again: "Do all prophesy? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?".... The Church is a compact body composed of different members, and is strictly analogous to the human system.... All members of the natural body are not the eye, the ear, the head, or the hand� yet the eye cannot say to the ear... Nor the head to the foot, I have no need of thee; they are all so many component parts in the perfect machine�the one body; and if one member suffer, the whole of the members suffer with it; and if one member rejoice, all the rest are honored with it. These, then, are all gifts; they come from God; they are of God; they are all the gifts of the Holy Ghost; they are what Christ ascended into heaven to impart; and yet how few of them could be known by the generality of men (Ibid., page 70 ff.). The sermon goes on developing the divine theme clearly, impressively, reasonably. Joseph Smith spoke soundly, inspiringly. One marvels at his spiritual insight, his knowledge and understanding of the scriptures and the common sense he reveals in their interpretation. His words leave a message which is easy, for those prepared in spirit, to accept, and easy to remember. These are marks of true literature. In another inspirational book� Joseph Smith, Prophet Teacher� by B. H. Roberts, we are given a scholarly analysis and eloquent presentation of the masterful contributions to the world of this spiritual leader. It is recommended for careful reading and rereading.

Studies and Activities 1. Examine our "Articles of Faith" for their literary qualities of clearness, orderly statement, concreteness, and rhythmic language. Have each in turn recited expressively. LESSON DEPARTMENT 2. A. What is the effect of a careful study of the Prophet's sayings and sermons in helping one to an understanding of the gospel as taught by the Latter-day Saints? B. How do these expressions help one also to understand the Prophet himself? 3. Carry forward the study introduced on the Prophet's Sermon on the Holy Ghost, or take some other sermon of his and study it. Observe carefully not alone the message he impresses, but also the literary qualities that mark it. 4. Give three to five basic characteristics you find in the language expressions of Joseph Smith that help make of them effective religious literature.

Social Science�Latter-day Saint Political Thought Lesson 3�Political Ideas Advocated by the Prophet Joseph Smith Elder G. Homer Durham For Tuesday, January 25, 1949

Prophet Joseph Smith. Evan Jensen as well as being a prophet, Joseph Smith was an American. As such, he underwent the political experiences of the Latter-day Saints and the Americans of his day. But towards these experiences he applied a growing conception and appreciation for political and religious freedom and related problems. From the revealed word he taught the doctrine and ideal of the kingdom of God.

Section 65 of the book of Doctrine and Covenants, dated at Hiram, Ohio, October 1831, identifies the infant Church he established as the kingdom of God on earth. Moreover, "the keys of the kingdom"�divine authority� had been re-conferred on men�himself and others.

Few people understand or realize the immediate significance of the Prophet Joseph Smith's inspired declarations, viewed in terms of political theory. The Latter-day Saints were exceedingly practical and proceeded with the business of "kingdom-building" on the American frontier, with city planning, economic and social experimentation, and proselyting activities which received local, national, and international attention.

By January 4, 1833, Joseph had written an American newspaperman, N. E. Seaton, that the secular States of the world were facing destruction, and that in order to escape, "all people, high and low, rich and poor, male and female," should repent and be baptized.

The snowball growth of the gospel, like Daniel's "stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands" (D. & C. 65:2) with its social system and Church government, attracted wide attention and received complex reactions, even persecutions. The Book of Mormon, with its ideal of true Christian society (IV Nephi), aroused antagonism as well as support.

This situation led to a rich political experience in Joseph Smith's own lifetime, as he endeavored to find the sphere of freedom within the practical political world, wherein the little "kingdom" could grow unmolested. Joseph Smith on the United States Constitution

Joseph Smith was ultimately forced by experience to the position where he elaborated and justified the use of force in order to maintain liberty. But more fundamentally, the Prophet's political theory presupposed conditions that would make resort to force unnecessary.

As early as August 6, 1833, pronouncement was made (D. & C. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�OCTOBER 1948 98:4-10) that the principle of freedom was God-given and "belongs to all mankind," and that constitutional law should support that principle.

A few months later, December 16, 1833, a revelation was received (section 101:76-80) in which the Constitution of the United States was set forth as the fulfillment of divine purpose "for the rights and protection of all flesh, according to just and holy principles; that every man may act in doctrine and principle pertaining to futurity."

Thus was opened the way for reconciling the conflict between kingdom building and the American nation, one of those nations supposedly headed for destruction unless the people received the gospel. In short, in Latter-day Saint belief, American government has a peculiar and special nature under a Constitution which is inspired because it fundamentally recognizes basic "free agency" or human liberty, a limitation which God established.

When the Prophet offered his dedicatory prayer at the Kirtland Temple, March 27, 1836, mercy was invoked "upon all the nations of the earth" and petition made that "the Constitution of our land... Be established forever" (D.& C.109:54).

Later, on March 25, 1839, a letter was penned in which the Prophet declared that the Constitution was "a glorious standard... Founded in the wisdom of God" because it embraced the principle (federalism combined with civil liberty) which "guarantees to all parties, sects, and denominations, and classes of religion, equal, coherent, and indefeasible rights" (D. H. C. III, page 304).

In other words, the Constitution of the United States sets up a political system within which the kingdom of God, itself mild in nature, subject to self-restraint and toleration, could flourish. The idea is that a good State must necessarily be limited to the extent that it guarantees liberty to and noninterference with religious groups and any other human association based on the liberty of individual conscience, provided that the association, in turn, recognizes the fundamental limitation of free agency, and which is imposed on the American State by its Constitution. As the Article of Faith puts it, as contained in Joseph Smith's letter, March 1, 1842, to John Wentworth: "We claim Almighty God according to the Articles of Faith." A State granting liberty of religion keeps open the avenue to morality in the people; thus may the voice of the people demand that which is "good." And if they do not, the remedy in Latter-day Saint political thought lies in the Church, whose responsibility it is, as Alma said, "bearing down in pure testimony against them," and in love and faith, awakening the individual and social conscience to worthy citizenship.

The Nature of American Government
A "constitutional federal republic" is perhaps the best descriptive phrase for the American governmental system. "Constitutional" means that the Constitution provides the fundamental limits of power while describing and distributing the powers among the government and states. The nation has complete authority over any individual or thing, except in wartime, when total powers have been exercised by the National Government. "Republic" means power is exercised and controlled primarily by representatives chosen from among the people. Thus we have our constitutional federal republic, in which public power is distributed, divided, and subdivided, in the interests of the people's liberties under law, but effective action yet made possible.

The Prophet on Practical Political Problems
On February 7, 1844, in support of his announced candidacy for the American presidency, Joseph Smith published a lengthy booklet. Views of the Powers and Policy of the Government of the United States (Joseph Smith: Prophet-Statesman, pp. 144-167; D.H.C. VI, pp. 197-209). A number of interesting views are set forth such as:
1. The ever present danger that those elected to high office will look to their own selfish interests rather than those of the public.
2. Military preparedness: "To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace."
3. Peace, notwithstanding preparedness, must be the unswerving objective of foreign policy.
4. "Agriculture, manufactures, navigation, commerce, need the fostering care of government," including a "judicious tariff."
5. Reorganization of Congress to make a smaller, more workable body.
6. Practical politicians will make free use of "reform" measures to win fame and power instead of accomplishing real improvements.
7. The substitution of remedial, corrective measures for traditional methods of penology. "Let the penitentiaries be turned into seminaries of learning."
8. Abolition of slavery by compensating the owners.
9. Economy in public affairs.
10. Banking reforms suggestive of the federal reserve system of today.
11. Increased responsibility for the President in protecting civil rights.
12. Peaceful expansion of the American system to embrace Texas (then an independent nation), Mexico, Canada, and "all the world: let us be brethren, let us be one great family, and let there be universal peace." (For the Prophet's platform, see D.H.C. VI, pp. 390-392 or Joseph Smith: Prophet-Statesman, pp. 180-183).

The Mission and Destiny of America
Some suggestion of the Prophet's conception of the role of America in world affairs may be gathered from the foregoing discussion. His faithful follower, President John Taylor, put it this way a few years later: "It is true that the founders of this nation, as a preliminary step for the introduction of more correct principles and that liberty and the rights of man might be recognized, and that all men might become equal before the law of the land, had that great palladium of liberty, the Constitution of the United States, framed. This was the entering wedge for the introduction of a new era, and in it were introduced principles for the birth and organization of a new world." (The Gospel Kingdom, page 309).

On May 12, 1844, speaking of the kingdom of God ideal, the Prophet Joseph Smith stated: "I calculate to be one of the instruments of setting up the kingdom of Daniel by the word of the Lord, and I intend to lay a foundation that will revolutionize the whole world." (Joseph Smith: Prophet Statesman, page 200).

On April 8, 1844, he had told the general conference at Nauvoo: "The whole of America is Zion itself from north to south." (Ibid., page 198). As President Taylor expressed it on December 17, 1871: "The worst wish we have for the human family is that the principles enunciated in our Constitution may reverberate over the wide earth, and spread from shore to shore until all mankind shall be free." The obvious meaning of these views, propounded by the Prophet in relation to the mission and destiny of America, is that within the framework of constitutional principles, the restored gospel message of Christ the Lord can be spread and God's kingdom be established throughout the world. Tied with America and its Constitution, the "entering wedge of a new era," then, is the destiny of the human race. Whom the gospel message fails to attract will still have the benefit of American influence wherever constitutional freedom spreads and prevails.

The Constitution of the United States, American government, and the Church and kingdom of God are thus seen as twin, co-ordinate objects in the political thought of Joseph Smith, each with a mission of liberty and service to mankind. Questions for Discussion
1. What is the Latter-day Saint idea of the kingdom of God? (The following books contain excellent selections on the subject: Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith; Joseph Smith: Prophet Statesman; The Discourses of Brigham Young; The Gospel Kingdom; The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff; Gospel Doctrine.)
2. Does the principle of freedom belong to all mankind?
3. What is "all mankind"?
4. What reasons exist to support the belief that the United States Constitution is an inspired document?
5. What is the fundamental connection between religious freedom and good government? Why is the principle of religious freedom an essential element of a sound political theory?

Lesson 3 - The Presidency of Brigham Young

For Tuesday, January 25, 1949 Elder T. Edgar Lyon

THE PRESIDENCY A UNIT THE THREE ARE ONE
BRIGHAM YOUNG President Brigham Young

The second President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Brigham Young, was born in Vermont, June 1, 1801. In 1830 he was living in Mendon, New York, where he was following the trade of carpenter, joiner, painter, and glazier, when he first heard of the Book of Mormon. He was converted largely by this book, but did not join the Church until 1832, after which he moved to Kirtland and became intimately associated with the Prophet Joseph Smith.

At his first meeting with Joseph Smith, the Prophet called upon Brigham to pray, and in his prayer, he spoke in tongues, and the Prophet announced to those present that the gift was from God, and added, "'the time will come when Brigham Young will preside over this Church" (Nibley Preston, The Presidents of the Church, page 52). Brigham Young was selected a 712 member of the first quorum of Twelve Apostles of this dispensation, February 14, 1835. He played a prominent part in the Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois periods of the Church. In a revelation given through the Prophet Joseph Smith, January 10, 1841, the Lord says: "I give unto you my servant Brigham Young to be a president over the Twelve traveling council" (D. & C. 124:127). Less than six weeks after Joseph Smith was murdered, Brigham Young and the Council of the Twelve Apostles were sustained as the presiding body of the Church. They functioned in this capacity from August 1844 until December 5, 1847, when the First Presidency of the Church was reorganized near Council Bluffs, Iowa. Brigham Young was sustained by the apostles as President of the Church and he chose two counselors, Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards. Then the apostles sustained the First Presidency of the Church. Brigham Young was sustained president with Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards as his counselors. They were sustained by the Church in the log tabernacle at Council Bluffs, December 27, 1847. The new President was to continue in this calling for nearly thirty more years. During this time, because of the loss of his counselors by death, he was assisted by two additional first and two additional second counselors other than those previously mentioned. Brigham Young stood at the head of the Twelve as the governing body at a time when there was need for a leader of great forcefulness. The members of the Church have all heard or have read the testimonies of those who were assembled in the Grove in Nauvoo, after the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum, when the Quorum of the Twelve, with Brigham Young at its head, was sustained as the Presidency of the Church. Typical of these testimonies is that of Emmeline B. Wells (the fifth general president of the Relief Society) who was present when "the mantle of the Prophet Joseph fell upon Brigham Young and so transfigured him that the people marveled." All through the long years of her life, she related this incident in the assemblies of the saints with earnestness and vigor. It was evident that the saints would soon have to leave Illinois. This called for great organizing ability and much wisdom in choosing a new location as well as resourcefulness in providing the means of getting there. The records of the Church during this period indicate that Brigham and his brethren met frequently and studied reports on the Far West. Then, under the inspiration of God, they decided upon their place of settlement. "We will carry out all the measures of Joseph," said Brigham. Many times he expressed the conviction that his experiences with the Prophet during the journey to and from Missouri with Zion's Camp were the most valuable that could have come to him in fitting him for the exodus to the West. In addition to the practical leadership of Brigham Young, he was preeminently a spiritual leader. Under his direction the unfinished temple at Nauvoo was rushed to completion. This was done at great sacrifice in time, money, and labor even when it was apparent that the saints would not long enjoy its use. He was determined that they should have the benefits of their temple endowments and do some ordinance work for the dead, before they embarked on the long trek to the West. When Brigham Young entered the Salt Lake Valley for the second time in the fall of 1848, he had two counselors who were well qualified for the responsible positions they held. Elder Kimball was a man of sound judgment and great courage, and with his other gifts he had an unusual sense of prophetic insight. Willard Richards was a man of penetrating intelligence and added much to the technical organization of the Church and the establishment of the institutions that were needed for their government and in the regulation of their interrelations in their new pioneer life. After entering the Great Basin, Brigham Young commenced to unfold the plan for building the "kingdom of God" in a most remarkable fashion which indicated a great vision of the future destiny of the Church. Emphasis was placed upon the necessity of providing the essentials to maintain life—the securing of food, clothing for the cold winters, and shelter from the cold and heat. He urged the people to be economically self-sustaining and to this end he encouraged the emigrating saints and the missionaries who were abroad to bring or send to Zion artisans of trades and occupations which could be adapted to the use of the Latter-day Saints in their mountain homes. Coal mining, iron smelting, cotton raising, silk culture and manufacturing, tanning of hides, manufacturing of paint, shoes, harness, hats, linen, paper, ink, glass and lead products, cabinet and furniture works, soap making, woolen manufacturing, the sugar beet industry, and others were commenced, in addition to the usual farming and livestock activities. 713 MUSIC FOR THE RELIEF SOCIETY CHOIRS WURLITZER ORGANS WURLITZER ORGANS WURLITZER ORGANS FOR BETTER ACCOMPANIMENTS SELDON N.

AT YOUR BOOKSTORE The planting of the many settlements from San Bernardino, California, and Carson Valley in the west, and from Call's Landing in Arizona to Fort Lemhi on the Salmon River in Idaho in the north, were all made as part of his plan to establish latter-day Israel firmly in these mountain valleys, and to enable them to utilize the various natural resources for the temporal salvation of God's people. Along with these activities the spiritual needs of the people were not forgotten. Every settlement was in reality a planned Church unit, under the leadership of the bishopric. No settlement was without its combination Church-schoolhouse, and it became the center of the spiritual life of the people. The great pioneer leader did not think it sufficient to send out a colony and then read reports of its activities, but he endeavored to visit each colony, yearly, if possible. On these pilgrimages he encouraged the colonists with sound, practical advice and fed them the bread of life by preaching to them spiritual messages as he spoke under the inspiration of God. He encouraged them to seek wholesome recreation that would restore their tired bodies and invigorate their minds.

Nor was he forgetful of the need of increasing the membership of the Church nor the divine obligation to preach the gospel to the nations of the earth. The missionary work in Europe was expanded to include most of the Continental nations, and more systematic organizations were effected to cover the North American continent and the islands of the Pacific Ocean. Through the organization of the Perpetual Emigrating Fund Company, many thousands of converts were enabled to emigrate to Zion through this cooperative enterprise who otherwise would never have been able individually to meet the costs of the journey.

Prior to his joining the Church, Brigham Young was an obscure laborer engaged in farming, the building trades, and functioning as an unpaid Methodist class leader. It was through the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, his contacts with the Prophet Joseph Smith, and the power of the Priesthood that he was enabled to lead the Church as he did. He declared: I do not wish men to understand I had anything to do with our being here. That was the providence of the Almighty. It was the power of God that wrought out Salvation for His people. I never could have devised such a scheme.

When he passed from mortality on August 29, 1877, at Salt Lake City, the life of a great prophet-leader closed amidst the scenes of the great achievements his leadership had accomplished in the barren wastes of western America. B. H. Roberts said of him: These achievements write down Brigham Young as the Greatest Pioneer and Colonizer of modern times—an Empire founder; and place him easily among the first score of Great Americans.

716 HEBER C. KIMBALL
Heber C. Kimball
The man whom Brigham Young chose to be his first counselor in the Presidency of the Church in 1847 was one of his closest personal friends. He was well suited to the task and Brigham's close acquaintance with him had revealed the characteristics that were needed to help him carry the tremendous load that he would have as President of the Church. Heber C. Kimball was born in Vermont, on June 14, 1801—just thirteen days after the birth of Brigham Young. He likewise had established himself in Mendon, New York, but he had learned the trade of a potter as well as farming, and in 1830 at the time of a "revival," had joined the Baptist church. About three weeks after his baptism he heard of the restoration of the gospel and he and Brigham and Phineas Young and their wives journeyed to Pennsylvania where they visited with members of the Church. In April 1832, he was baptized and in September of that year he and Brigham and Joseph Young visited Kirtland and met the Prophet Joseph for the first time. They soon moved to Kirtland, and from that time until the death of the Prophet, Elder Kimball was closely associated with him, being one of the original group of Twelve Apostles.

He was sent by Joseph Smith in company with other brethren to open the British Isles to the preaching of the restored gospel in 1837, where they firmly established the Church in those countries. In Nauvoo he became an enthusiastic worker for the development of the saints' city, and after the death of the Prophet was a loyal supporter of President Brigham Young. When the Presidency was reorganized on December 5, 1847, President Young assigned to him the first place in the counselorship, and for the remaining twenty-one years of his life, he stood by his best friend as he had previously supported his Prophet.

In the pioneering of the Great Basin, Elder Kimball was one of the planners and stimulators. With Brigham Young he visited the colonies that had been established in the various portions of the then expansive Utah Territory, and spoke prophetic encouragement to the struggling saints. He was also a member of the territorial legislature for many years. His particular gifts in speaking appear to have been his ability to speak the language of the common man and to explain doctrines and make them impressive through the use of homely stories and apt sayings which were long remembered and afterward quoted by the saints as gospel truths. He was also possessed of a fine sense of discernment. Particularly did this spiritual gift manifest itself in predictions.

718 At Nauvoo when they first commenced to establish the city he remarked: "This is a beautiful place but not a long resting place for the Saints." 'This incensed Sidney Rigdon who was convinced that their troubles were over, but Brother Kimball's prophecy was soon fulfilled.

Many are the stories told of his predictions concerning the future of the saints and their troubles and of the Church and its destiny. As a result of a severe fall sustained in Provo, Utah, he died at Salt Lake City on June 22, 1868. Brigham Young lost in him a wise counselor and the saints an approachable leader who lived close to them. God had taken one of the most humble of this world to confound the mighty, the wise, and the strong.

Topics for Discussion and Study

1. What characteristics did Brigham Young possess for the great work that was placed upon him at the death of Joseph Smith?
2. What purpose do you suppose Brigham Young had in establishing many small settlements throughout the intermountain region, rather than the settlement of a few large cities?
3. What particular contribution did Heber C. Kimball make to the establishment of the Church in its western home?
4. Read and evaluate Heber C. Kimball's "Address to My Children," found on page 151 of Life of Heber C. Kimball.

Park Free Articulate, Resonant Words In Singing Florence J. Madsen Member, General Board of Relief Society
Words are freeborn.... They have the same right to dance and sing as the dewdrops have to sparkle and shine—Abraham Coles.

N song the words are just as important as the music. They represent the thoughts, feelings, and emotions that are to be conveyed. It is essential, therefore, that they are fully understood by the listener. However, the words are not to be overspoken to the sacrifice of the tone quality, nor should they be spoken in the small speech form of ordinary conversation. The singer, like the dramatic reader, must use the large speech form which means the full use of all the resonating cavities of the head and face.

This further implies that the mouth is well opened, the lower jaw thoroughly relaxed, the tip of the tongue touching the lower front teeth for all vowels. In the meantime all the resonating cavities such as the hard palate, the sinuses, the nose, the face-mask, etc., should be unobstructed so that they can function fully as amplifiers of the tone.

To obtain the most satisfactory word-resonance the hum tone must be cultivated. The singing-hum is properly produced by observing the following:

(a) Yawn position of mouth
(b) Closed lips
(c) Teeth well apart
(d) Tongue relaxed, teeth (e) Lower jaw free and unprotruded touching front

This hum is to be practiced with "M" in three different ways:
1. Sustained on various pitches in the medium part of the voice
2. Partial scales and arpeggios (chordlines) then in their entirety
3. Well-known song melodies, such as "Sweet Hour of Prayer," "Abide With Me," "Love's Old Sweet Song" (chorus), etc.

During all humming and word singing the following vocal positions should be adhered to:

(a) Erect standing or sitting
(b) High and expanded chest and ribs
(c) Contracted abdominal muscles

With practice these positions can be maintained without the least semblance of rigidity. This is accomplished when all of the released energy used in singing is balanced and equally distributed and when all of the muscles concerned remain elastic and easily subject to the dictates of the will.

Singing, as well as being an aesthetical expression, is very definitely a physical exercise, and all normal physical exercises are possible only through equalized and correlated energy.

From fear and Sar
Maryhale Woolsey, author of "Curtain Call," was born in Spanish Fork and has lived in Utah most of her life. As a young person, she was indignant that no one had ever written a song about our western mountains—so she did something about it and the ever-popular "Springtime in the Rockies" was the result. She writes stories, poems, plays, and songs. Her work has been published in the Church magazines and Eastern and Canadian magazine. She is a member of the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP), League of Utah Writers, Art Barn Poets, and National Writers Club.

Mrs. Woolsey has four daughters who are also talented in writing and art. She attended the B. Y. U. In Provo, Utah.

Just now I sent in another group of Magazine subscriptions for our small branch. I picked up my expiring copy and again read the inspiring poetry therein. Such a beautiful book you are giving us. Money couldn't buy mine back. The contents are complete, especially for a homebody like myself, but the poetry is the best anywhere. It is the first thing I read.

Your executive officers very kindly placed me on the complimentary list for The Relief Society Magazine. I should like to become a paying subscriber if this is possible, as the articles on the old pioneering days and old customs are interesting.... During the war the Rector one day had two young American ladies in uniform who paid us a visit from London and asked to be shown over the church. During the visit one stated that her grandmother had been in service as a housemaid in the rectory over ninety years ago and her mother wanted a photograph of the old rectory, which was duly done. It is things like these which link our two nations together, also our two churches, although many miles apart.

I am taking this liberty to send in my appreciation for your splendid Magazine, although I am not a member of the organization, being a man, but I have been treading the Magazine for almost half a century, and I must say some of the finest contributions include the short stories.


I used to wonder why we didn't have more writers of stories, real life stories, written by our own people. Now that wish has been realized during recent years for some of the very best stories are found in The Relief Society Magazine.

F. M. Shafer, Moab, Utah

One of the most interesting pages in the Magazine to me is the reprint page from "Sixty Years Ago." It seems to link my contribution to Relief Society, small as it is, with all those who have gone before. I feel the magnitude and timelessness of this work.

Wasn't it fun to read the fashion notes in the last issue on that page (September 1948)? Mabel Jones Gabbott, Salt Lake City, Utah
