SUMMER IN THE WASATCH

The Cover: "Summer Roses," by L. V. McNeely

WE live in a changing world—a world that has perhaps changed more during the past fifty years than it did in all the previous 1,000 years. For illustration, let us ask what electricity, gas and oil fuels, motor cars, airplanes, radios, television, and atomic energy have done for our mechanical civilization during the lifetime before fifty years old. And these factors are nothing changes in the field of mechanics! Take, for example, the accompanying changes in our thinking, believing, acting and living. Is not the privilege—if voting hardly responsible for bringing multitudes of women into politics, business, the professions and, unfortunately, vice indulgences to an extent previously unknown? Then, respectable women did not smoke or drink. Now, many of them indulge as freely as men do.

As a result of all these changes in the fields of mechanics and human lives, the picture of living is greatly different today from what it was then. Is it better or worse? The correct answer depends on the point of view. Mechanically, yes, decidedly. Socially, in some respects, yes, and in others, no. Without question there has been a deterioration in the family life of multitudes of homes. Divorces are far more numerous, juvenile delinquency has multiplied, morality has sunk to lower levels, crimes have increased and faith declined.

In all of these deteriorations the use of narcotics—particularly alcohol and tobacco—has played an important part.

The Lord said: "That inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong drink among you, behold it is not good . . ." (D. & C. 89:5).

Drink brings cruelty into the home; it walks arm and arm with poverty . . . ; it puts chastity to flight; it knows neither honesty nor fair dealings; it is a total stranger to truth; it drowns conscience; it is the bodyguard of evil; it curses all who touch it. Drink has brought more woe to the city, broken more hearts, wrecked more hopes, and caused more crimes and murders than all the wars (First Presidency, October Conference Message, 1943).

Alcohol paralyzes the inhibitions, renders the physical urges more obvious, disarms the critical faculties, breaks down reasonableness and prudence, blurs finer sense of perception and taste, without necessarily creating the state of intoxication. Alcohol is the best producer known and is responsible for a great part of crime and the promotion of prostitution (Dr. Haven Emerson, in Alcohol—Its Effect on Man, page 82).

No arguments are needed to establish the truth of the above statements relative to the effects of alcohol. Observation and experience certify to their truth.

As to the nature of alcohol we may read:

Alcohol is a poison inherently, absolutely. Occasionally, in a drop or in a gallon, in all quantities, it is a poison. Plainly the quantity cannot affect the chemical composition (The Journal American Medical Association).

Cocktail Lounges

Now, relative to the participation of women in drinking alcoholic beverages, the records show drinking is alarmingly increasing among them.

Behold, it is not coming; it has come—the cocktail lounge America. I lived through a generation of the saloon. Then, no woman could enter a saloon, embrace the brass rail, and ever live down the disgrace. But I have lived to see a disgrace a thousand fold deeper.

In some of America's greatest hotels I recently saw a cocktail lounge—I beg your pardon, a Ladies Cocktail Lounge—the largest drinking place I have ever seen in my more than four-score years. The managers told me their average daily customers totaled three thousand. America's death is in that spot.

Some six hundred years before Christ there lived a hero by the name of Jeremah. He said: "There are among my people wicked men: they set traps, they catch men." Were Jeremiah living today he would exclaim: "What a perfect picture of the liquor hood and all that connotes" (Dr. Elmer Ellsworth Helms, in The Voice).

Kathleen Norris wrote:

For generations excessive drinking by men has been the curse of helpless womanhood and childhood, has been the creator of want and slums, cruelty and crime. For millions of women and children today this curse has represented the one desperate effort of their lives and the one fervent prayer of their hearts.

It is a sorrowful thing, it is a bitter reflection upon the code and character of American women today, that this curse is being extended to include them; that thousands of our women—and by no means our poorest women; by no means the women who have sunk to the lowest stage of degradation—are voluntarily placing themselves in the group of the drunkards (Chicago Herald-American, September 28, 1943).

EXPERTS estimate there are in America today three million drunkards—human beings who drink excessively and are frequently, or more less continually, drunk. Of these, there are multitudes of otherwise respectable women—sad, almost too sad to mention, but indicative of how the terrible evil of drinking has grown among the fair sex. During the past ten years the per capita consumption of distilled liquors (whiskies) in the United States increased eighty-five per cent, according to the Distilled Spirits Institute. But the increased consumption among the fair sex during this period is said to be much greater than among men.

According to the United States Department of Commerce, nearly nine billion dollars ($8,779,000,000) was paid in this country during 1946 for alcoholic beverages. This is the same period for all types of public and private schools, including school and university libraries, and for state and federal government services in the fields of health, welfare, old age assistance, etc.

Now, if drinking did any good to its consumers, saying nothing of good in some small measure commensurate with the enormous expenditures involved, there might be a little justification for drinking. But there is no justification. Then, in view of the many and varied ills and evils resulting from drinking and of the fact that the vast sums spent for drink are worse than wasted—why do people drink? Let us put the question (inoffensively of course) to any who might drink, why do you drink?

If you are gracious enough to consider the question and give me an answer, your reply will probably differ more or less from that given by others—but, in the last analysis, it the 366 answers may be consolidated into one—you began and continue to drink because other people drink. 'To a greater or less extent drinking has become fashionable—is believed to be the smart thing to do, especially by those who are ambitious to be socially O.K. Now all of this has come about because Satan and his hosts operate ceaselessly among our Father's children with the objective of leading them away from the path given by the Lord for them to follow if they would please him and experience the joys of living that he has promised them through obedience. "... Men are, that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25).... In consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days, I have warmed you, and forewarned you, by giving unto you this word of wisdom by revelation—that inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong drink among you, behold it is not good... (D. & C. 89:4-5). This is a divine truth. Human observations and experiences have verified it over and over again.

Now as to "evils and designs... In the hearts of conspiring men," let us refer to advertising. In a hearing relative to this matter before a committee of the United States Senate in May 1947, Senator Capper said: The national bill in 1946 for alcoholic beverages was nearly nine billion dollars, eighty-nine dollars for every person in the United States over eighteen years old—about one-fourth of the federal budget for the coming year. Now, Mr. Chairman, I believe that the tremendous amount of advertising seeking to whet the appetite for drinking, seeking to create new customers, especially among women and children, has much to do with the greatly increased amount of alcoholic consumption during recent years. It is generally agreed in the business world that advertising is one of the most fruitful means of increasing business and of promoting sales. Certain it is that the vast sums (more than one-hundred million dollars) annually spent for widespread, alluring, deceptive advertising have had much to do with greatly increased consumption of alcoholic beverages during recent years, especially among women and teen-agers.

But what shall we do about all this?—a simple question for all Latter-day Saints. They know the answer—total abstinence; have nothing to do with the manufacture, sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages —easy to say. Then, why do they indulge? Let each one answer for himself, remembering what the Lord has said relative to the matter. Is it not an admission of weakness or lack of faith for any Latter-day Saint to indulge? Yes, so the men of the world say. Then, does indulgence help or handicap a professed Latter-day Saint in his efforts to win the respect and confidence of non-members? Weaklings or hypocrites are never trusted—never wanted in positions of responsibility. Let every Latter-day Saint remember this, particularly every one ambitious to climb. Moral courage and dependability are among the essential qualities in the lives of professing Church members who would succeed in the business world.

Many examples illustrating the truth of these statements could be recited. But this is needless here, for every observing and experienced faithful member can tell them.

Contest Announcements—1948

The Eliza R. Snow Poem Contest and the Relief Society Short Story Contest are conducted annually by the general board of Relief Society to stimulate creative writing among Latter-day Saint women and to encourage high standards of work. Latter-day Saint women qualify under the rules of the respective contests are invited to enter their work in either or both contests.

The General Board would be pleased to receive entries from the out-lying stakes and missions of the Church as well as from those in and near Utah.

STAY-AT-HOME
Lael W. Hill
Far blow the wild winds over the land,
Over the land and the sea,
Over the world—from water and sand
Gathering magic for me.
(How they sing through my heart all the long, long days
While I wield the tools of my homely ways!)
"Pearl-tinted shells lie down by Tanjore,
Under warm Indian streams,
Under the edge of the ocean-kissed shore
Learning their murmuring themes . . . ."
(Turn the tap now, let the water run free;
Dishes and pots and pans clatter at me.)
"Silent, the Sphinx with his mysteried gaze
Keeps vigil close to the Nile—
Keeps the dark secrets of Pharoah's days
Under the mask of his smile . . . ."
(Smooth out the sheets, white as African sands;
Beds will be neater for work-at-home hands.)
"Lanes of the ocean call thunderingly!
Ships plunging distantly through,
Carry adventure across the gray sea—
China . . . and Spain . . . and Peru. . . ."
(Straighten the books that hold wonder, cloth-bound;
Dust the globe quickly—and spin it around.)
Some there may be whom the wind-runes impel
To following, all life long.
These I wish joy, and fulfillment as well;
I have my work—my song.
(I shall still own my dreams, if I never go
Where the far, wild winds of my longing blow.)

For Makers of Rhythmic Beauty
Carlton Culmsee, Ph.D.
Dean, School of Arts and Sciences, Utah State Agricultural College, Logan, Utah
[Prepared by special request as an aid to poets who plan to enter the Eliza R. Snow Poem Contest—Ed.]

WOMEN are born poets. They live close to elemental forces, rhythms, mysteries. But they differ prodigiously in their power to evoke in others the feelings that come to them. One reason they differ is that some of them "play by ear," while others acquire the art of poetry and thus gain technical strength and richness. For anyone who fashions winged words is as far from thrush-like spontaneity of song as the radio is far from the wind in the wires. Because the gift for penning poetry is cultivable, one may make bold to offer a few suggestions to women poets.
Since the goal is better poetry, the first problem is to decide what constitutes good poetry. A true poem may be said to be a contribution in rhythmic and melodious words to the world's beauty. It is raised above mere prose by greater intensity of emotion, deeper suggestiveness, and higher beauty.
Now then, if a woman desires publication or a poetry prize, she should adopt an appropriate attitude. Previously, perhaps, she has written simply for the fun of it. But when she ventures before the figurative footlights—when she offers her lyric wares to the public—she leaves a snug little realm and enters another more exacting, more full of opportunity and responsibility. The atmosphere is that of competition. Once she had only herself to please; now she must please thousands. She has asserted superiority, and she must prove that she possesses it.
The obligation of the creative artist is, therefore, to contribute, to give something, or to do something better than it has been done before.
"Why do you write a poem?" a reporter once asked Frost.
"To see if I can make it different from all other poems," the poet answered.
The reporter laughed, but Frost was not being merely flippant. He meant that each time he wrote he attempted to create some new bit of beauty.
This article is not, however, intended to help heighten the fever to be original at any cost. That frenzy has resulted in a miscellany of freakishness which has fully as much connection with our life as with the life on Mars, but not more. These efforts, impelled by a desire to end imitativeness and sometimes, apparently, to cut all links with the past, are hopeless. Shakespeare and Jonson, Wordsworth and Coleridge, Frost and Eliot could not have done it if they had wished; and neither can we.

Nor should we wish to cut our roots. The great poets have gained strength and stature by building upon the mountain of the past, and so can we.
"The old way to be new" — the only sound way — is to let the great masters of poetry in all ages help you unfold your own capabilities.

Page 371
FOR MAKERS OF RHYTHMIC BEAUTY

Then, as Emerson urged, "Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string." You yourself are truly a creation in the sense of being a unique personality. Your task is to see and feel with the sensitivity of this peculiar individuality that is yours only, and to communicate with utter sincerity and fidelity.

IF you have nourished your verbal conscientiousness, you will feel acute discomfort when you use a word that falls short of full and honest expression. You are flatting a note, spoiling a song, when you fail to match the word with the idea.

But beyond mere precision is a requirement more truly poetic: the need of suggestion. Bald facts cannot make a poem, and mere statements cannot either, no matter how tricked out with meter and ornaments. As Frost on another occasion said, "Poetry is the only true thing that says one thing and means another." Yet poetry is not duplicity. It summons its powers to suggest the inexpressible. To come as close to the mysteries as reason and intuition can approach and to suggest these flashes of insight and faith through the most suitable symbols — that is the poet's hardest task.

But I hope no one will be misled by these allusions to misty and remote intangibles. The poet must be highly concrete and sensuous; and he must realize that bald and abstract statement is not poetry. Vivid appeals to the five senses are the raw materials from which the poet fashions word-paintings, word-sonatas which delight with their beauty and inspire with their hints of inexpressible meaning.

But there are other verse faults besides abstractions and prosy statements. To pass briefly to the negative, let me list typical faults observed in hundreds of poems:

1. Threadbare idea.
2. Threadbare words, figures of speech, and modes of expression. If you let a pine "sigh," you will make your reader yawn. Calling a cloud "fleecy" turns it into a dust-mouse of triteness. And trite words are doubly obtrusive in rhyme, such as those which link "strife" with life" and "love" with "above." Likewise, such elisions as "o'er," "e'er" and "'twas" are relics of an outworn fashion.
3. Tacked-on moral. Bryant said it all before he came to the last stanza of "To a Waterfowl." The modern poet may be as moral as he wishes, but he suggests rather than preaches.
4. Padding; stuffing out a line or a stanza with words merely to get enough feet to satisfy the "meter-reader."
5. Weak ending; failure to sustain the original impetus.
6. Prosiness, meaning lack of suggestion, lack of fresh, sensuous appeals and imagery, lack of sufficient intensity and elevation of style; in short, lack of poetry.

After all, however, poems do not succeed because of the absence of minor faults, but because of the presence of strengths and virtues. Two criteria by which you may measure your latest poem are these:

1. Suggestions. Does it suggest something too elusive or deep for mere prose to express?
2. Contribution. Is it the finest contribution to beauty that you can create at this time?

You Can Write a Prize Winner
Olive W. Burt, Magazine Editor, The Deseret News
[Prepared by special request as an aid to writers who plan to enter the Relief Society Short Story Contest — Ed.]

IT isn't easy to write a prize-winning story in any contest — but it isn't too difficult, either. For every person who has lived with any degree of sympathy and understanding has locked within her experiences at least one excellent story.

The catch comes in recognizing that story and in putting it down on paper in such a way that others can recognize it.

What is a good story?
Every writer's magazine or handbook carries a variety of definitions, so that the beginner may be confused and at a loss to decide just what constitutes a story.
A simple and adequate definition seems to be that a story is a significant emotional experience sincerely and simply told. This definition covers even those highly plotted action stories, because there must be some sort of emotional experience by the characters if they "come alive" at all and are not mere wooden puppets acting without rhyme or reason.

The first task, then, is to recognize such an emotional experience. It may be in one's own life, or in that of a friend, or it may never really have happened at all, but be merely an emotional experience that could happen, given certain characters and certain events.
Some writers have a store of such experiences just waiting to be put down on paper. Others can think up one, if they put forth a little effort. Others may find it difficult to decide just what material should be used.

There are a number of simple devices for sparking the thought processes along these lines. One might ask, "What would happen if?" and then make up a situation — an old mother was unhappy living with her married children and was determined to find a home for herself. Or — a middle-aged married woman suddenly found herself longing for the adventure and excitement she had never known while rearing her family. Or — anything at all!

Right here might be the place to point out that stories for the Church magazines, and in particular for The Relief Society Magazine, which is our present consideration, need not be moralistic. That is, the moral does not have to stick out like a sore thumb, to the detriment of the story and the annoyance of the reader. Every profound emotional experience has some moral implication. Let it stand — unemphasized and in its rightful place, hidden in the story — the more deeply hidden, the better.

HAVING decided on the emotional experience that is to be the heart and core of the story, the next problem is to decide on the characters. Usually, the main characters
Page 372
Page 373

Now how to put the problem down—how to reveal the emotional experience so vividly and poignantly that the reader will also "live through" the story?
There are two things to watch here: the writer must feel the story, herself. It is absolutely right that her tears should fall or her chuckles be heard as she writes. That is the most vital. And the second is like unto it—she must make her readers feel the story, too.
The simplest way to achieve this latter aim is by the use of simple, direct words and phrases—by the choice of specific rather than general terms.
Describe the characters by pointing out the special little things that make each one different from the others. The old mother may have faded, pale lips, as soft and dry as withered rose petals; the middle-aged wife may have her graying brown hair brushed back from her smooth, competent brow; one rebellious curl, only, escaping the rigor of the confining combs—or however she is seen by her creator—the author of the story.
Special details should be carried over into each bit of action, a word or a phrase making that episode different from any other that ever took place.
A device for gaining this definiteness is to write the story in the best possible manner, swiftly, and then go back over each character and each episode to check. If that particular necessary, specific term is not there—if the writer does not see this character, this episode, vividly and differently, then the particular words can be inserted.
IT remains only to write the story. The author has her emotional experience selected; she has her characters and her initial situation. If she feels the story authentically and sincerely, the events will follow one another without too much trouble on the author's part. In the initial situation the characters, acting according to their personalities, will react in a certain way. This will give rise to the next situation, where the reaction is more or less inevitable.
A couple of warnings here: it is dangerous and seldom satisfactory in a story to follow real-life episodes and situations. In real life there are so many intangible and extraneous forces working upon the character that the reaction can never be predicted with assurance. In a story, all such impalpable influences must be disregarded, and the character must act according to the definite traits that have been emphasized.
And, as a general rule, the characters should act in accordance with generally accepted behavior patterns. That is, only experienced writers should attempt to show abnormal reactions: a mother should love her

Relief Society Building News
WITH the passing of June, there remains only the last quarter of the year which was set aside for the collection of the money for the erection of the Relief Society Building. In order for the books to be balanced in time for the general Relief Society conference, September 29 and 30, it is necessary for the final report accompanied by remittances to reach the general board by September 10. The year October 1947 to October 1948 will be marked as the time that the women of the Church, supported by the brethren, gathered the funds for an undertaking of which the sisters of the Church had dreamed since the days of Nauvoo.
As these last months pass, it is the earnest hope of the general board to find the name of every Relief Society member in the stakes and in as many of the missions as possible enrolled as a contributor. The names of many of the brethren will likewise be found as donors of Special and Memorial Gifts. The names of persons memorialized will also be entered upon the rolls to be placed in the cornerstone and preserved in the records of the general board. After the conclusion of the fund-raising period in October, special sheets will be sent to stakes and missions on which to list the names of contributors therefore no lists of names should be sent in before that time.
Serious reflection on the work the women of the Church have accomplished and the greatness of this present undertaking, brings forth many expressions of gratitude for the opportunity given to donate to this cause.
The following letter from Juarez Stake on the completion of its quota is printed as a typical expression of such appreciation:
Relief Society General Board Salt Lake City, Utah
Dear Sisters:
Enclosed is a check which pays the Juarez Stake Building Fund quota in full. I am proud to submit this payment for it has proved to be an accurate proof of the devotion of the women of this stake to Relief Society work. It has been collected, not from projects nor sales of material on hand, but by individual solicitations. Not a member but has made an individual contribution as she was solicited by an authorized agent.
The grand total represents all types of sacrifices, ranging from careful saving of a

peso at a time to the denying oneself of a personal need in order to have her donation ready. But in every case the sacrifice was willingly made. Not one sister, when the true facts were presented to her, but wanted to be counted among the contributors. And not one but proved she was equal to any demand made of her, just as are the women of the Church at all times. And not one but will be proud of her part in the erection of a Women's Building, though many there are who will never see it. Not one but feels she has helped the smallest stake in the Church to measure up and compare favorably with the larger and more affluent stakes. They have proved that strength comes from achievement and that confidence and power are obtained by overcoming seeming impossibilities.
Very truly yours,
(Signed) Nellie S. Hatch, President
Rita S. Johnson, Secretary

Individual receipt cards are being issued to the tens of thousands who have given donations. Many of these will be treasured in the years ahead by faithful Relief Society members who are today but girls whose mothers have encouraged their growing daughters to donate so they can be counted as contributors in the years to come. From such a free-will offering given by young girls may spring the roots of a devotion to Relief Society throughout their entire lives which will allow them opportunity to give their services to the Church.

A House By Friday
Fay Tarlock
"IT will be up to you to find a house," my husband called to me from the bathroom of the Hotel Geneve where he was shaving, our first morning in Mexico. "I won't be back from the stadium before dark any day. And I'm late now."
This seemed an exaggeration; the sun was not yet up. I yawned and stretched my travel-weary limbs. "I don't see how I can possibly find a house," I protested, thumping my pillow and preparing to sink into it, ready for a sleep as soon as he left the room. "The only Spanish words I know are buenos dias, cuanto and es mucho."
"As long as you keep saying the last, we'll get along." He grinned down at me. "Get a newspaper, The Excelsior is as good as any, and you'll find a list of places for rent on the English page." He was at the door now.

"Call up the housing agencies; they all speak English, and they might send someone to show you around. And don't forget the Diplomatic Proviso." He shut the door carefully so as not to awaken our small son, and was gone.
I went back to sleep. The high altitude was wonderful those first few weeks; it helped us to sleep through all the worries and noises of Mexico. When Danny awakened at nine I got him into his last clean clothes and we went down to the dining room. It was very pleasant there with the brilliant murals and the sunlight streaming on white table linen and dark-eyed waitresses.
As I ate my first slice of papaya and munched a second pan dulce (sweet roll), the problem of finding a house seemed simple.
"Everything is so cheap in Mexico," many people back home had told me. "Houses and apartments are plentiful there and so reasonable. You can pick one in any neighborhood you want."
Wasn't the American Embassy just around the corner? The obvious thing to do was to go there and get a list of houses. And do it before twelve o'clock because today was Saturday.
It was exhilarating walking along Calle Londres, breathing the thin air, sweetened by last night's rain. Dense white clouds were floating across the deep blue sky, and it was warm enough to throw back my coat. I looked up at the gray houses, reminiscent of the reign of Maximilian and Carlotta, and at the tree-lined avenue. Just as I had read, it was like Paris, only the air was better.
At the Embassy there was a charming young woman rushing through her work for a weekend in Cuernavaca. Between answering the telephone in two languages and giving out information, she found me a list of apartments for rent.
Not one to hesitate, I chose the address nearest the Embassy. First we had to cross Avenida Insurgentes, the busiest thoroughfare in Mexico. Three times we started across and three times we came scurrying back to the sidewalk. The cars and buses went by in a never-ending stream, each one driven by a madman, I was certain. The din of the honking made my head whirl. This will never do, I thought. I told myself that for years I had strolled across Market Street in San Francisco every evening at five o'clock. Grabbing my son in my arms, I ran. Taxis swerved by me, a red bus seemed to touch my dress, and a car came to a screeching halt. But we were across. The apartment house was ultra modern. The list said furnished, and my hopes rose. These new apartment houses were furnished with charm and comfort, surpassing those of the States, I had heard. The foyer door was open; I rang every bell in the place, but no one answered. Across the avenue I could see a little soft drink place with a familiar sign. The proprietor was a sandy-haired man who looked like an American. When a lull in the traffic came, I made a second dash across Insurgentes. The proprietor had once been an American, but the patina of Mexico lay upon him now. The apartments, he assured me, were lovely. They had everything that Madam could wish for, and if I cared to sit in his shop he would go across to ask the manager, a dear friend of his, if there was a vacancy. I sat down and ordered lemonades for us, which we slowly sipped until the man returned. He came straight to our table, spreading his hands in a purely Latin gesture.
So sorry he was, but the apartments were unfurnished. If I cared to furnish one, I would be charmed with the results. I thanked him and started for the next address, thankful it was on the same side of the street. A servant girl with strong white teeth and long black braids answered my ring. I said buenos dias and was stopped. The girl stood there, smiling and patient. I got out my list, mumbling something about apartment. Instantly her smile flashed in understanding. "Un momentito," she said, carefully closing the door.
But Danny had other ideas. "I'm tired; I want to sit down," said he, squatting squarely in the doorway. The maid was distressed. Doors are not left open in Mexico. I removed my son and waited. "Un momentita," I repeated, savoring the word. I had another one to add to my vocabulary.
The door opened cautiously and a vivacious little Mexican woman smiled up at me. "The apartment was what you say for rent. Now eet ees no more." The door shut carefully again.
"I don't want apartments; I want a house," my son said.
BEFORE lunch I inspected two other apartments. One was so big that it was a day's journey from the front door to the kitchen. The price I did not inquire. And the next, in contrast to the shining cleanliness of the others, looked as if it had not been cleaned since the days of Porfirio Diaz.
After luncheon I called an agency. A man with an American voice answered. Yes, he had houses if Madam could afford them. People in the States, he said, had the erroneous idea that living was cheap in Mexico. Instead of a house, I should have an apartment, no? I thanked him and hung up the receiver.
I took a little nap and started out again with the Embassy list. A HOUSE BY FRIDAY "Take a libre when you go any place," my husband had told me, "and you must bargain with the driver." Try to get him for a peso. Don't offer more than one fifty."
I was refreshed, but not enough to give my Spanish vocabulary another try. From the address the apartment was only a few blocks away. But after I had walked an hour, I realized that the Mexican numbering system was not the same as that at home. We made frequent stops to sit on the grass. Still my legs were trembling.
My number was on the third and top floor of the building. Only a maid was in the apartment; she made no attempt to speak as she led me through the rooms. The furniture was charming, the beds sagging and hard, and the kitchen was not pleasing. Mexican kitchens, I was learning, were not built for the lady of the house.
Out on the street I saw a cruising libre. In a moment of inspiration, helped by my tired legs and my protesting son, I said, "Hotel Geneva, un peso cincuenta centavos." The driver opened the door and we got in.
Sunday we would have all day to look for houses. On Sunday my husband bought a paper, pointing out that he had already suggested this procedure. I said nothing. It seemed rather silly to confess that on my first day I hesitated even to buy a paper.
"There's no use looking for anything in the Lomas," he said, running down the list, "only rich Americans and politicos can afford to live there."

And San Angel is too far out for my work." He read further. "Here's one on Aguas Calientes, modern with two bedrooms." The price he read was high, but not entirely beyond our means, provided we economized on other things. "That's the same street as the stadium," he went on. "Can't be much of a place." We drove near the vicinity of the stadium and I agreed with him. There was no use going to any house, he said, because Sunday in Mexico was no day for it. I objected, reminding him that in San Francisco it was the big house-hunting day. Well, it was different here. We drove towards Chapultepec Castle to watch the Sunday parade.

MONDAY morning I called up two agencies, getting almost identical lists from each. Neither offered to show me the places. I delayed going because at noon Mr. Tarlock was coming to take me to one place. We decided nothing must be overlooked and started for Aguas Calientes. In the park around the National Stadium the country men were standing in patient lines, waiting to get inside on their first lap of the journey to the States. Past the stadium the buildings become larger and more ornate. Across Insurgentes was an entirely different section, one with beautiful homes, well-tended sidewalk lawns and gardens. Willow trees lined the street. The number was set above a high glass gate, protected by an iron grill. A white wall, topped with barbed wire, obscured the view of the house. We found the bell, imbedded in the concrete of the wall. After a long wait a neat young servant girl with low coifed hair admitted us. She bowed and with lowered eyes asked us to be seated in the garden. I was delighted. The house was a white stucco with a red-tiled roof and had beautifully leaded windows, shaped in Gothic arches. The garden was lovely with its tiled walks, neat lawns, and roses and carnations, arranged in geometric design. Close to the house were two pomegranate trees in full bloom. On either side of the garden were two tiled seats, above each seat a lovely plaque. There was also a tiled fountain, spouting a tiny spray of water into the brilliant sunshine. I sat down on the bench, my eyes bright. This was my house!

The great glass door opened and a young man came out, a University student, I was sure. He had light-brown hair and blue eyes and no Castilian Don could have been more proud. Although he bowed and said, "Buenos tardes," I felt myself to be an undesirable turista who should never have crossed the Rio Grande. The youth permitted us to enter the house. Once inside, my spirits soared even higher. There were long tiled corridors with high ceilings, bathed in sunlight from the arched windows. In the living room or sala was the largest fireplace I had ever seen. Indeed la sala was as large as the average American home. Above the fireplace hung a magnificent tapestry woven with golden threads. The walls were a Spanish brown; the high-beamed ceiling was white. Across one end of the room was a Chinese tapestry with white dragons, turquoise trees, and floating blossoms, all against a red background. The furniture was hand-carved mahogany, some of it Spanish and some of it French, and like nothing I had ever seen outside a museum. There were high-backed chairs with red leather seats, each with a different coat of arms, and a massive desk. About the room was a profusion of carved tables and oriental vases. A glass door, high as the ceiling, led to the dining room. This had a red-tiled floor and one side was all windows and glass doors, leading into a charming back garden, where stood a single tree, not yet in bloom. The kitchen was newly whitewashed. It boasted a steel sink and cabinet, an electric refrigerator, and a new gas stove.

We went back to the living room, my feet light on the polished oak boards. Halfway up the long, tile-decorated stairway was a window portraying a mountain village, green in the subdued light. One of the two bedrooms was Madonna blue and rose, with elegant mahogany furnishings. The other bedroom was simpler, in cream and brown coloring. And the bath! Blue tile almost to the ceiling and another leaded window with a design of a blue mermaid with long golden hair, sitting on golden rocks above the splashing sea. There was a closet bigger than a dream, and a clothespress in the smaller room. The windows overlooked an old colonial estate across the street.

I was beside myself to know if the price mentioned in the paper was right and if we could rent the house. The youth refused any answer. We had permission to telephone his mother, who would be home at two o'clock. At precisely two o'clock I was dialing the Frickson telefono. A pleasant voice answered, "Yes, yes, I can tell you the price, but will you not call at seven this evening that I may talk to you personally." Just at seven o'clock we again rang the bell in the white wall. The same demure maid admitted us. We lingered for a moment in the serenity of the garden. It was almost dark, for there is little twilight on the plateau. The house already seemed our own.

A young girl, evidently the youth's sister, appeared in the doorway. She stood there for a moment, after the lights flashed on. She was no more than five feet tall, as delicately made as a China figurine and graceful as a flower. When she introduced herself, she was as gracious and warm as the boy had been remote. Her English? She had learned it in the States, where she was born. "Now," she said, "I do not often get a chance to speak it, but I read much in English."

As she spoke, a slender woman, dressed in black, with a lace mantilla over her head, came into the room. She was a beautiful woman, white-haired, with bright, flashing eyes. She and the room combined all the stories and enchantment of Old Mexico. Instinctively we rose to greet her.

The house, she explained in her charming voice, had been the special quarters of her husband, built to house his tapestries. This room had been his office. Now she was a widow, with no use for so many rooms. Would we like to see the house again? In the evening light the house seemed even more captivating. I had to pull myself from the spell and be practical. Seated again, we talked of many things: the rising prices, the war, Mexico in the spring. Everything except renting the house. Each time we neared the subject, the Senora expertly steered us to other topics.

My husband gave me no help in bringing the conversation around to renting the place. I knew that in a moment we must go, and nothing was settled.

Gripping the arms of the leather rocker, I asked in forthright western style if we could rent the house. The Senora looked pained. "That I do not know, just now," she gently chided me. You perhaps have not seen many houses yet." Then she smiled. ''I must have time to think. Your boy here" — she reached out to save him from spilling backwards from a carved chair . . . ''there is much glass . . . there are my gardens ... I do not know. In a day or two you may call me again." With exquisite courtesy she bade us good night. "We can scratch that number off," the head of the house said as we drove back to the hotel. "She doesn't want a child there." I felt badly. I had heard so much of the great love Mexicans had for children. I had not expected Danny to be an obstacle. "There's nothing he could hurt really," I protested. "He doesn't harm things and I'd be so careful." Tomorrow get busy and call agencies. Get all their places . . . was But Tuesday morning I called an agency. After checking the cheapest places, I asked that appointments be made for me to see them. That afternoon, with the aid of the pocket dictionary, I bargained with a driver to take me to the addresses, wait, and return me to the hotel.

The first house was on the edge of the Lomas. It had so many unnecessary rooms that my head ached with even the thought of keeping them clean. The furniture was brilliant and elaborate, but none of it comfortable. The beds were hard and the kitchen would require two assistants to the cook. Outside was a long-neglected garden and a dead lawn.

The second place was in the Lomas itself. A high hedge surrounded it, a hedge shot through with iron bars and with an iron gate that seemed to touch the sky. After a long wait a man servant admitted me. I followed him up a winding path to the house. There was no entrance at all. The servant pressed a button. Miraculously the front parted, revealing stairs and a door. Again the door was heavily barred. We waited for it to be opened from the inside. Once inside I tripped and almost fell over a stout iron pipe, a thief trap I was to learn later.

The house was empty at nights except for a watchman. The owner, a smartly dressed woman, and the interpreter, her friend, waited beyond the iron bar. The place was quite new, the rooms large and sunny. There were two bedrooms and a study that could be made into a child's room. The house was amply furnished, but not elegantly, except for the satin wallpaper, an import from France. Instead of a single kitchen, there were two, each with a table in the center, piled high with cooking utensils.

Because the owner was leaving for RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE June 1948, South America, the house could be rented immediately if I signed a three-year lease and deposited seven hundred pesos to insure that the wallpaper would not be injured. I swallowed and said that tonight I would bring my husband to sign the lease, provided the Diplomatic Proviso was inserted.

There was much excited chattering and I caught the words "Tio Sam." I felt certain from their faces that I would not sign the lease. I was relieved also; the markets were a long way off, which meant my stay in Mexico would be spent riding back and forth on buses.

The ladies announced their decision. If Madam could not find a house within a week and this house was still unrented, she could return. In the meantime the Senora's attorney would investigate the Proviso.

The next day, Wednesday, I went out to Colonia del Valle, where rents were more suited to government employees. One house was cheap enough, but it was so dark, here in the land of vivid sunshine, that electricity must be burned all day. Another house almost met my desire for a place small enough to be manageable. It was set in a pleasant little garden, protected by a hedge.

The owner was a sweet little gray-haired lady who wanted to go to another state to live with her son. Just how I learned this, I could not rightly say, for she spoke no English, but we soon had each other's life history. She was an artist. At least she did her own art work. Each room had been decorated with murals. The artist had gone berserk with purples, (Continued on page 428)

The Latter-day Saints in San Bernardino
Evelyn Wilde Heath
Former President, San Bernardino Stake Relief Society

To San Bernardino, be sure to stop for awhile. It is called "The Friendly City," and well merits the name. It is cosmopolitan in its activities; its buildings are fine and modern; its streets are wide and straight. It is a beautiful city of about 57,000 population, the county seat of San Bernardino County, which holds the distinction of being the largest county in the world.

This city of beauty and unlimited advantages stands as a monument to the ingenuity of those farseeing men who engineered and planned it; a monument to the stout hearts of that fine group of Latter-day Saints who first settled in its valley. Perhaps San Bernardino, as a city, would never have been a reality had not ex-soldiers of the Mormon Battalion in California carried back tales of the country they had left, and of its superior advantages. These tales stimulated the desire of the saints in Salt Lake City to go there, and by 1850, many were anxious to move toward the Pacific.

Because of this, and a need to establish a wagon road to California, and also a place where converts, arriving from various points, might rest and equip themselves for the journey to Utah, consent was given for the move. The "Manuscript History" of President Brigham Young states that the original plan for this settlement called for about twenty persons, is or fortune ever leads you whereas, when they were assembled, the number approached five hundred.

Elders Amasa M. Lyman and Charles C. Rich were appointed as leaders. Elder Parley P. Pratt, who was heading a group of missionaries en route to the South Sea Islands, also accompanied the party. From his diary, and the diary of Elder Rich, comes much valuable information regarding the trip.

Brother Rich mentions Andrew Lytle as "Captain of hundreds," and David Seely and Joseph Mathews as "Captains of fifties." He refers, also, to Parley Pratt, Captain Jefferson Hunt, Samuel Rolph, and Wellington Seely as "Captains of tens," and to Elder Amasa Lyman as "Captain of two tens." We know, from this, that the movement was well organized.

During the early part of the journey the company traveled in two sections. In all, there were 150 wagons, 588 oxen, 336 cows, 21 young stock, 107 horses, 52 mules, and about 437 men, women, and children.

Needless to say, formidable difficulties faced them and, while their approximate route was the old Spanish trail of the thirties and forties, many were the trials encountered from the heavy desert sands, rocky country, steep mountain grades, and attacks by Indians. Stretches of dry desert wastes, with little water or food for the animals, were a constant hazard.

Page 385-386

MORMON GRISTMILL
The photograph shows the gristmill as it was remodeled by William A. Conn after the departure of the Latter-day Saint colonists. Many accounts are told of the treacherous journey of this company, of their faith and their constant appeals to God to strengthen them and their teams, and of their miraculous deliverance from the horrors of the desert. One can, therefore, imagine their great joy that this trip was made with so little loss and misfortune.

At the latter end of the journey, Amasa M. Lyman, Captain Jefferson Hunt, Joseph Mathews, and Charles C. Rich preceded the wagon trains, and on June 9, 1851, reached the sycamore grove near the southern end of Cajos Pass. Captain Seely's fifties reached this point two days later, June 41, 1851.

The date on which these weary and footsore Mormon pioneers paused on the edge of the San Bernardino Valley is, indeed, a memorable one in valley history.

WITHIN A MONTH OF THEIR ARRIVAL AT THE SYCAMORE GROVE, this colony of saints held their first conference. David Seely was elected President of the mission, with Samuel Rolfe and Simeon Andrews as counselors, and Richard R. Hopkins as secretary. From the intimate views of life in San Bernardino as recorded in the minutes of Brother Hopkins, much rich material has been gathered.

That the pioneers were welcomed into the valley, first reservedly, then with greater confidence because of their apparent fine qualities, is certain from an account taken from The Los Angeles Star early in July 1851, which reads: We learn that they (the Mormons) are negotiating for the purchase of the Rancho of San Bernardino from the family of Don Antonio Maria Lugo, by whom it is held. This is the site of the old Mission of San Bernardino. Here probably this interesting people will make their first establishment on the shores of the Pacific.

A later and less reserved mention is quoted from the same source: The Mormons are an industrious community, and will develop the resources of this county to an extent that will give it an importance second to no county in the state.

After careful consideration, negotiations were concluded for the purchase of the San Bernardino Rancho for the sum of $77,500. One realizes from this the vast undertaking and obligation that lay ahead of these settlers. In those days, the settlers were vulnerable to vicious attacks by the Indians regardless of the friendly attitude the saints held for them, and it was necessary to build a strong stockade, which was accomplished by the donated work of all the men of the settlement.

The stockade occupied approximately 700 x 300 feet of space. The walls were of fifteen-foot cottonwood and willow logs, split in half, and set three feet in the ground side by side. Upon this spot, where once stood the stockade, the fine building of the San Bernardino County Court House now stands, while a marker designates the place as "The Mormon Stockade."

Crowded into this small space, housewives must have had many nerve-wracking experiences for the men were away the greater part of the time. They were heroines indeed.

Here they remained, waiting for the surveying and laying out of the city. As with all Latter-day Saint settlements, the planting of crops was paramount. It is recorded that by December 1851, a field of 1300 acres was selected as a grain field, and a 300-acre field for summer crops. Also, a tract for a vineyard was laid out.

Early in April, Elders Lyman and Rich planted the center stake for the City of San Bernardino on Temple Block (now Pioneer Park). This was located on E Street, between Fifth and Sixth Streets. Mr. Hess, a surveyor, assisted them. When the streets were laid out, the ones running east and west were numbered as at present, but those running north and south were given names. The present E Street was Salt Lake Street, and D Street was Utah Street.

A canvas pavilion had served as an assembly hall, but in April, a "bowery" was erected. It was an adobe building sixty by thirty feet. Here the conference was held on April 6, 1852. This building served for day school for 125 scholars under the direction of two well-qualified teachers and was also used for Sunday services.

Much mention is made of the importance of schooling for the children of the settlement. The first gristmill for the production of flour was located near the intersection of the present Mill and Allen Streets. The mill wheel was to be turned by water diverted from Warm Creek. This work was begun in May 1852.

A note dated June 26, 1852, written by Brother Hopkins is of special interest: Today we have the pleasure of receiving news from our friends in the Valley (Salt Lake).... Near nine months has elapsed without our hearing a word from them. All hands turned out and gave hearty welcome to eight numbers of the Deseret News.

That the spirit of love and charity existed in this early settlement is very evident by the fact that the first Fourth of July was celebrated, on July 5 (the Fourth being Sunday), by harvesting the grain of Elder Rich during his absence on a trip to Salt Lake City. Every July Fourth, thereafter, was celebrated in patriotic fashion.

That the valley was fertile and crops successful is certain for it is recorded at a "Harvest Feast" held September 4, 1852, such specimens were displayed as a stalk of Indian corn sixteen feet high; four onions weighing nine and one-half pounds; a cabbage weighing twenty-four and one-half pounds; with melons, squashes, and other vegetables in proportion.

On November 7, 1852, Colonel Henry Washington, a United States Deputy surveyor, completed erection of a monument on the top of Mt. San Bernardino. Through it ran the base line from which surveys in the southern part of California were, and still are made. This street is called Base Line today.

In the Fall of 1852, Captain Jefferson Hunt was elected to the Legislature of California and in April 1853, he introduced a bill to form San Bernardino County from the eastern portion of Los Angeles County. This bill was passed. The following month, Elders Lyman and Rich and Brother Thorpe began work upon their sawmill on Mill Creek.

This met the settlers' needs for several months; then, in order to reach the top of the San Bernardino mountains, where a greater amount of timber could be obtained and where another mill would furnish further lumber, it was necessary to build a road. This enormous task was accomplished by the men of the Latter-day Saints' settlement alone. It is estimated that the project cost about 1000 days of labor. A monument, in honor of the men who built the road, was erected in 1932, at a point where the old road, made by them, crosses the present highway.

One wonders at the great FIRST STEAM MILL IN THE SAN BERNARDINO MOUNTAINS 389 accomplishments of these early-day settlers, and especially at the building of so many sawmills, which space will not permit to be enumerated, nor credit given to their builders, but for which an engine and boiler were even dismantled from a British vessel, and hauled into San Bernardino. 'This was done by Charles Crismon who is credited with having the first steam sawmill on the mountain top. Brother Crismon was active in many sawmill operations.

Equipment for another mill was shipped around the Horn to Wilmington. The equipment for the various mills was evidently freighted to the mountain tops by the use of block and tackle or the snubbing post, and the united strength of many oxen. The Latter-day Saint settlers furnished, not only their own people, but Southern California, as well, with flour and lumber from their mills.

This mill was built in Huston Flat, about 1853, by Charles Crismon. In 1865, it was moved to Blue Jay camp in Little Bear Valley, then to Pacific Electric camp, and finally to Lake Arrowhead.

DEDICATION OF PIONEER MONUMENT ON HIGH-GEAR ROAD, 1932 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�JUNE 1948

This monument, in the San Bernardino Mountains, marks the point where the present highway crosses the old Mormon road, which was built for hauling lumber down from the mountains.

ANY new settlers were now arriving in San Bernardino valley from various points and news was becoming more plentiful with their arrival. At about this time, Elder Lyman, Elder Rich, and their company began the erection of a store building. Goods for the store were bought in San Francisco, and shipped by steamer to San Pedro. Ten teams hauled these goods from the steamer to San Bernardino.

In September 1853, the survey of the City of San Bernardino and the laying off of the streets was begun. The city was divided into blocks with one-acre lots, and it now became possible for families to leave the stockade, and begin to build homes. This was followed by an era of building business blocks and various community structures, as well.

In 1853, the saints in the valley also came into personal contact with a national undertaking. This was of great importance, for, under the direction of Jefferson Davis, then Secretary of War, the Federal Government surveyed Cajon Pass with reference to its suitability as a railroad pass.

The next year, the City of San Bernardino was incorporated, and on June 5th was held the election for the first city officers, as follows: Mayor, Amasa Lyman; the council, C. C. Rich, G. W. Sirrine, Daniel Starks, William J. Cox, and Q. S. Sparks; Marshall, J. D. Holliday; assessor, Theodore Turley; treasurer, J. H. Rollins; attorney, A. A. M. Jackson. Ordinances were adopted to restrict drinking and gambling.

In the spring of 1855, freighting to Salt Lake began on a commercial scale. The United States Government had expended $25,000 of the amount needed for improvement of a road between Utah and California.

SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY HOUSE

This building is on the site of the old Stockade. Note the street marker, with the Court house, and designating it as the "Mormon Stockade."

Elder Lyman and Elder Rich were called in 1857 by the Church authorities to return to Utah, and on about April 16, they, with others, making quite a train, left San Bernardino for Salt Lake City. In this train was Joseph H. Ridges, a convert from Australia, who later built the great organ in the Salt Lake Tabernacle.

The responsibility of the property, and its remaining indebtedness, now rested on Ebenezer Hanks. In the records of Brother Hopkins appears the following: October 30. The mail from Great Salt Lake City arrived at San Bernardino with lots of news. President Brigham Young thinks the valleys of the mountains (in Utah) is the place for the saints.

THIS was about the time when the coming of Johnston's Army threatened the security of the people in Utah, and was, no doubt, one factor which influenced President Brigham Young to recall the San Bernardino settlers.

On November 2, President Cox received counsel from President Young to forward the saints to the valleys of Utah as soon as possible, in wisdom, and November 3d found quite a number of the saints leaving San Bernardino for Utah. It is easy to imagine the heartache and disappointment felt by those saints who had struggled so unceasingly to make a settlement.

On February 15, 1858, Brother Ebenezer Hanks formally deeded to William A. Conn, George L. Tucker, and Richard G. Allen, the last of the San Bernardino Rancho—about 25,000 acres—for the sum of $18,000. This cleared up the indebtedness and left a little balance.

Captain Jefferson Hunt was, perhaps, one of the last to leave the valley.

So ended one of the most touching chapters in the history of Latter-day Saint pioneering.

Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, June 1, and June 15, 1888

"For THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ZION AND THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ALL NATIONS"

BRIGHAM YOUNG We do not call thee Chieftain, Thy cheek would flush to hear Earth's titles woven with thy name, And whispered in thine ear, As well presume to gild the sun, Or paint earth's brightest flowers; We only call thee Brigham Young, We only call thee ours.

EDUCATION IN UTAH: Simultaneously with the constructing of homes, the subduing of lands, began educational work in Utah. It was like all things else a difficult and rather unpleasant undertaking, as there were so few conveniences; but it became the task of a noble and bright young woman—Mary Jane Dilworth, afterward wife of Bishop F. A. Hammond—to collect in her brother-in-law's tent, even before the houses were built, and instruct the children who were playing away the sunny hours in the courtyard of the old fort.

This was the first school in Utah, and the first school teacher was a woman. As other companies of children arrived in the valleys and the people spread out in other directions, other schools were started and the demand for teachers became greater.

MRS. EMMELINE B.

Wells, our editor, pleasingly tells of a little school of 65 kept by herself in 1851-52 in a log building in the upper part of the city; how, without desks, charts, blackboards, or scarcely two books of the same kind, she toiled as an instructress—A. W. C.

NOTE: The Queen of Sweden has been ordered by her doctors to get up early, make her own bed, take care of her own room, work in the garden, and take long walks. Under this regimen, her health is visibly improving.

SELECTED.

THE ALLOWANCE: We think that husband who has any certainty of income would do well to take into consideration the subject of his wife's wages, and see if he cannot accord to her the spending of one unquestioned dollar, and then make, according to his ability, some fixed allowance of money, be it ever so small, on which the wife can rely, and over which she can be absolute mistress. We can hardly think of a case where it would not work well. Without doubt, any head of a house would find his advantage in this course, in the character it would give his household, in the happy sense of responsibility it would give his wife, and in relief from requests and advice in small things which it would give himself.

FROM RAMAH, NEW MEXICO: We are having a most lovely spring, after the severest winter ever known in this place since the Saints settled here. Our prospects are bright and everything is promising—Phebe A. McNeil.

AN INVENTION: The Empress Victoria of Germany has turned inventor. From plans drawn by her, a writing desk has been manufactured which enables the Emperor to write whether lying in bed or standing up. It is available in any position, and the mechanism is said to be intricate and remarkably effective.

THE relationship between a father and a daughter is particularly precious. The father gives protection, provides the necessities of life, and above all bestows his priceless companionship. The daughter, as she grows and develops in discernment and appreciation, gives love, admiration, respect, and obedience. These emotions and loyalties are bright strands that hold the family close together.

Most important in the life of the daughter are the early, vulnerable years, which may not be remembered, but which, nevertheless, shape the pliable contour of all the years to come. The father and daughter began to get acquainted when the father took his baby in his arms and cradled her with tenderness. The attachment grew as they went walking together. She was only as tall as his knees and there was a great distance from there up to the top of the father's head, but his face was kind and she could look up and see how the wind ruffled his hair and she could look down and see the great strides his feet made, and she had to skip fast to keep up with him.

How tenderly a father watches and protects his daughter through the years of young womanhood, knowing that in her choice of friends and in her developing attitudes, lie the great determiners of all her future life. Few fathers would ever say, "See that you get a husband as good as your old father once established for her." Overlooking faults, always strengthening virtues, the true father stands back of his children in strength and tenderness.

He is old and becomes gradually less able to take an active part in life, more and more he appreciates the frequent letter, the cheerful visits, the little remembrances and words of appreciation. Every unselfish, hard-working father is a great man—and he should be made to feel that his accomplishments have been far above the power of his children to measure.

I would keep forever in my heart the picture of my father standing in the doorway of our adobe ranch house, which he had built with his own hands, looking out over the golden acres of wheat that rippled up to the cedared hills. I would remember his words, as he pointed to the harvest, "There is your college education." And then the grip of his hand as he said, "It will be lonely without you."

But the love of a father endures forever—a treasure never dulled by time or distance.

ADVENTURING

I trim my sails to the winds of chance
To charter an unknown strand
And find the keenest of all romance
Awaits in my own home land!
I covet the gold in the crystal fane
That dazzles across the town,
And find it all in my window pane
As the golden sun goes down!
Avaunt then to adventuring
On miraged sea and shore.
There is no zest so keen a thing
As the romance at my door!

LET THE HEART SOAR

Let the heart soar higher than these hills,
Beyond the barriers of space and time,
To where bright panoramas lie
Untenanted—realms of the sublime.
For we have need of vistas such as these
Illimitable plains; we need to see
The meagerness of transitory days
Against the vastness of eternity.

DEFINITION

But yet, Prayer, more than words,
Combines the humble attitude
With inarticulate beseeching.
As if The troubled spirit-child,
With hungry, searching arms,
Unto his Father-God were reaching.

Far Country
Gladys I. Hamilton
The conductor touched Ann T Medford's trim-suited shoulder and murmured, "We're coming into Rockwood how, Miss, Our station," "Thank you," Ann said pleasantly, but her hands were so clammy cold with nervousness that her new gloves were wet.
For the hundredth time since leaving Ohio, and her home, Ann wondered if Jim would like her. And, would she like him? Would he still be, man-like, expecting to see her as the eighteen-year-old girl he had been engaged to twenty years ago? Would he be shocked at what those years had done to her pink and white complexion, her soft, brown hair and trim ankles?
She hoped that life had probably changed him more than it had her. Ann was still slim, and her skin quite good. A few silver strands threaded her hair, for there was no denying that the years had left some trace of their passing.
She gathered her things from the hat rack, put her gloves in her purse, then took them out again. She stood up, but the train was still in motion, so she sat down again. She felt as fluttery and unpoised as a school girl, more so, for she hadn't the least idea what she should do or say when she saw him!
Jim would be waiting on the platform, naturally, in plain sight, since Rockwood was such a small prairie town. She needn't get off the minute the train stopped. She could peek out the window and if Jim didn't look . . . well . . . "right," she would just remain on the train and go on to California. Her ticket read straight through, anyway.
Ann and Jim had re-discovered each other only a few weeks ago through a mutual friend who had met Jim in Pendleton at the rodeo. Jim had written first from his ranch in Nevada, and Ann had answered. In the course of correspondence they both marveled that neither had married in all the intervening years. Timidly, they mentioned their old love, and the lover's quarrel in which Ann's mother had taken sides against Jim, which had resulted in Ann's yielding to her mother's wishes and breaking off the engagement.
Jim, his young pride crushed, had gone away shortly afterward. So the immediate question of their letters was, could they still fan the flame of that old love into the joyous wonder that it had been at eighteen and twenty-two?
They both fervently admitted that the fire had never really died, that no other person had interested either one of them, even mildly. Of course they wanted marriage and a home! The joy of marriage and children had been denied them in their youth, but there was still time to make a good life together. It was worth trying, they had concluded.
"I know my mind," Jim had written, "but you must decide, little Ann, for if you follow your heart you will be coming to a far country."
398

The train screeched to a stop and the ding-dong of the engine's bell sent shivery reverberations through Ann's breast. The porter, with her suitcases, was beckoning toward the door so that she had no time to scan the platform. She bit her underlip.
What if she couldn't stand Jim? What if he wore untidy clothes, and.... And had acquired bad habits!
Well, she thought, a person can always be honest and say she has made a mistake.
But Jim wasn't there!
The depot's weathered, splintery old platform was the most deserted, desolate spot she had ever set foot on in all her life! The conductor must have noted her look of horror, for he said calmly, "We'll be here ten minutes, Miss."
Had she really, deep in her heart, expected Jim to meet her? No. For the first time, she was inclined to agree with her mother's judgment of his character.
Ann tried to cover her disappointment and surprise from the gaze of the other passengers by walking briskly to the far end of the platform and looking off into the desert. The odor of sagebrush was pleasantly strong. It was the first time she had ever smelled it, but she knew instinctively what it was, and she liked it!
But her inner being felt hollow with terror. Had Jim at the very last moment decided that he couldn't face her? She knew that the habits of middle age were hard to fling aside. Perhaps he had suddenly realized the contentment of bachelorhood's unfettered days!
"This is western scenery, Ann," she told herself. "Enjoy it!"

RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1948

The sun was shining with a dazzling brilliance on the shimmering prairies stretching for endless miles on either side of the bleak little station. She thought that she had never seen such cloud-dotted blue, blue sky. Miles to the north, purple mountains broke the line of the horizon. Jim once said that he lived north of the railroad.
A man was hurrying up the track from the big, red water tank, and Ann held her breath. Could that be Jim? But no, this man was small and his hair, under his cap, was snowy white.
"Mornin', Ma'am! Can I he'p ya?" he asked pleasantly.

I was to meet a Mr. James Wallace. But he isn't here. Did you get a message?" "No, Ma'am, I ain't seen Jim fer..." He scratched his tumpled locks in thought. "Why, I ain't seen Jim fer two weeks come Monday. He come down to get some freight. Kinda fancy stuff, too, 'pears to me!" he added with a wink. The engine's bell began to clang and great puffs of black smoke darkened the sky. Ann thanked the old man and, with a stiff little smile frozen on her lips, climbed aboard the train and returned to her seat, while the porter brought back her bags. She tried to lose herself in the rhythm of the clicking wheels as the train gathered momentum. Perhaps it was better this way. The years might have done queer things to that lovable boy she had known and adored. It was quite possible that she could hate him as a man! What to do now? Go on forever in the Hallerton Library? She even chuckled at the mental picture of Far Country herself handing out weighty tomes to the literati of Hallerton, dressed in those new western togs folded so neatly in her suitcase, depleting her clothes' budget for a year! The train made another ten-minute stop at Cottonwood, but Ann did not raise the curtain, caring not at all that this was a sizable town of the real West, another part of her dream. Right now she had no taste for a country that could make a man so changeable that he did not know his own mind for more than four days at a time! For Jim's last letter had been ecstatic with anticipation. The vast prairies could be cruel, too, she supposed. The train gathered more miles under itself, nosing out toward the Coast. Ann supposed that something would help her decide what to do in due time. New friends, new hobbies, anything to keep from remembering. The porter roused her, "You Miss Medford?" "Why... Yes, I am." Ann straightened with surprise and thought that something dreadful must have happened to her brother and his family back home—her only relatives. THE porter handed her, not a telegram, but a folded piece of paper. "A gentleman asked me to hand this to you, Miss." Jim's writing! All the color drained from Ann's face, and for a moment she could not force herself to read his words for fear of what they might say. Probably the very thing she had reasoned out for herself. He had changed his mind! The porter stood patiently in the aisle, as if waiting for a tip, or an answer, or both. Ann read quickly: Dearest Ann: Heaven doesn't come to me easily, it seems. I was hurt this morning by a horse, not badly, but enough so that my partner had to rush me to Cottonwood where the doctor fixed me up before train time. 'Telegraphed and learned that you were aboard. I'm bedded down in a compartment. Guess you'll have to come all the way, sweetheart. Love, Jim. Ann's big moment was still before her! She trembled and a crimson spot burned in each cheek. Her heart was pounding like a tom-tom as she followed the porter's broad back. At length he paused, then motioned her inside. "Ann! Oh, little Ann! I knew you'd look just like this." Jim's pleasant voice came vibrant and tender from the white pillows. And there was Jim. Her old lovable Jim! A trifle heavier, perhaps. More masculine. She noted that the years had painted his crisp black hair slightly gray at the temples, too; but he seemed the same grand person her daydreams had pictured him. "Oh, Jim," Ann whispered as she dropped down beside him. "I... I don't know what to say! The past..., Our.... Our future.... Where shall we begin?" Jim's eyes quirked up in their well remembered old twinkle as he drawled: "Well, we might start with a kiss...." and he drew her into his arms.

Remember Pomanders?
Elizabeth Williamson

Making pomanders isn't a new idea; in fact it is a very old one. Grandmother made them, true, but centuries before her time they were in use. The superstitious peoples of the middle ages wore them on chains around their necks. Instead of the pomander we know, these ancient pomanders were small metal containers beautifully designed. They were worn to ward off the plague and to protect the wearer from contagious diseases. Frequently they contained a tiny book of prayers or spells. Occasionally they held herbs and spices as a scent, that were believed to serve as a disinfectant. By the time the pomander had reached our grandmothers it had changed considerably. The only feature that it had retained was that of furnishing fragrance. Fruit took the place of metal. Its purpose was no longer connected with superstitious belief. Now it served to scent the linens and keep the closets and boxes perfumed.

Pomanders are easily made: take an apple (some people prefer oranges or lemons) and cover it with whole cloves pushed in to the head, and sprinkle with cinnamon. Let the pomander dry until the juices evaporate and the fragrance of the spices is absorbed by the fruit. Wrap in cellophane, tie with a pretty ribbon, and you have a lovely and unusual gift.

Let's Have Cake
Ethel C. Smith
Member, Relief Society General Board

Now that we are back once more on free and easy terms with our sugar bins, it should not be difficult to answer the challenging query, "What's for dessert?" made by the small fry in our families as they gather around the dinner table, their expectant eyes shining from freshly scrubbed faces. If it's to be cake, they will all be delighted, as cake, in its varied forms and flavors, is a favorite of young and old alike. It is also a favorite with the cook because it is so versatile, standing alone on its own merits, or mixing companionably with fruit, ice cream, and various sauces; and it is the perfect accompaniment to punch or a glass of milk. It can be served as a dinner or luncheon dessert, is an old standby as a party refreshment, and behaves well when sent along to school in the lunch box.

There is an art to turning out a perfect cake, in which many cooks take the same pride and delight that an artist takes in blending colors and capturing a picture on canvas. Cakes may vary in shape—they may be round, oblong, square, or of some more elaborate form—but a perfect cake is always attractive in appearance and of uniform thickness. The crust is delicate brown, thin, tender, and slightly crisp, with no cracks. Perfect cake is light, tender, and moist. It has an even, fine-grained texture and a delicate flavor.

Most experienced cooks prepare some favorite dishes by taste or instinct, using the "pinch of this and dash of that" method with excellent results.

In the matter of cake making, however, there are a few basic rules which must be followed if the desired results are to be forthcoming. There is no doubt that merit in the new so-called "mix-easy" method of cake making being suggested by some manufacturers of cake flour, especially where the saving of time is of great importance. Recipes and directions are furnished by the manufacturers in their packages of flour, should you care to try them. However, the real thrill of making a cake comes from beating, blending, and mixing the different ingredients a step at a time, and from the perfect product which will reward the cook who gives the ingredients individual attention and introduces them to each other with due consideration. A culinary triumph is assured the cook who will use a tested recipe and will be guided by the following basic rules: Use Good Ingredients Only; ingredients that are strictly fresh and of good quality should be used if you wish to make a fine cake. The shortening must be of the best quality. There is nothing equal to butter for putting real flavor in a cake, but because of the high cost of butter today, it is sometimes necessary to substitute other shortenings when the recipe calls for butter. The following are equivalent to one-half cup butter: 1/2 cup oleomargarine; 7 tablespoons vegetable shortening; 6 1/2 tablespoons lard; 1 1/2 cups thick cream.

RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE

Fine, granulated sugar makes a finer-textured cake than coarse sugar. If sugar is coarse or lumpy, it should be sifted and only the finer particles used. Cake flour, which is made from soft, winter wheat, makes a lighter, more tender cake than ordinary all-purpose flour made from the harder wheat. Sponge and angel food cakes demand this lighter cake flour, but very satisfactory butter cakes can be made with all-purpose flour. Cakes containing nuts or fruits are less likely to be crumbly if made with all-purpose flour. If a substitution of all-purpose flour is made when a recipe calls for cake flour, about two tablespoons less to a cup should be used or the cake mixture will be too stiff. You will not have success with sponge or angel food cakes if all-purpose flour is substituted for cake flour.

Eggs, milk, and all other ingredients should be strictly fresh and of good quality. Temperature of Ingredients: All ingredients should be allowed to stand until they have assumed normal room temperature before mixing the cake. Measuring: Do not attempt to guess at measurements. All ingredients should be accurately measured with standard measuring cups and spoons. Level off with a spatula or the straight edge of a knife, as measurements are assumed to be level unless otherwise specified. Flour should be sifted before measuring as it has a tendency to settle down and become heavy, and the sifting process mixes air into it. After being sifted, the flour should be spooned into the measuring cup. It should then be resifted with the other dry ingredients called for in the recipe.

Mixing: Use either the beating or folding motion for mixing. When using an electric mixer, the beating time should be slightly less than when mixing by hand. Angel and sponge cakes will be lighter if mixed by hand and a wire whisk used. The beating motion should be employed for the first part of the mixing process and the folding motion during the latter part when the flour is added. In butter cakes, the sugar and shortening should be beaten and blended into a light, fluffy, smooth mixture. A round-bottomed bowl is the best type of mixing bowl to use, and if the mixing is done by hand, a wooden spoon is more satisfactory than a metal spoon. When the eggs, or egg yolks, are added, which is generally the next step in the mixing process, they should be beaten vigorously into the sugar mixture. This is the point where your beating will do the most good.

Alternate the dry ingredients and liquid when adding to the mixture, beginning and ending with dry ingredients. A good plan to follow is to add a third of the flour and half of the milk at a time, alternately. As these ingredients are added, the mixing speed should be reduced. At the same time, dawdling is not in order at this point and the mixing should be continuous with no stops. Mix well after each addition, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a spatula or rubber scraper.

If egg whites are to be added separately from the yolks, they should be stiffly beaten and folded in after the dry ingredients and liquid have been mixed. Nuts and fruits, if called for, come last and should be folded in, after being lightly dredged with flour. The dredging helps them to stick to the dough in the proper places instead of huddling together at the bottom of the pan.

As soon as the cake is mixed and poured into the pans, it should be whisked into the oven without delay. The light, fluffy mixture which will be the result of your efforts thus far will assume a sad, depressed attitude if kept waiting for the comforting warmth of the oven. If the baking pans haven't been prepared beforehand, or the oven hasn't reached the desired heat, or if you stop to answer the telephone, your cake will get even with you for your neglect by being heavy and sad.

Pans in which butter cakes are to be baked should be well greased and lightly floured; but pans for butterless cakes, such as sponge or angel food, should never be greased. Cake pans should be filled two-thirds full and set in, or near, the center of the oven so the cake will bake evenly.

Baking: This is a very important step in cake making. Many fine batters have been ruined in the baking. The oven temperature and time required for baking depend upon the size and kind of cake. For successful baking results, the oven temperature must be uniform, not constantly rising and falling. Most cakes should be baked at a temperature of 350 to 375 degrees. A slightly increased temperature should be used at higher altitudes.

There are several ways to tell when a cake is done, and it is well to use some of these tests even though the cake has been baked the specified length of time. First, the cake should have finished rising and should have a delicate brown crust; second, the cake should have ceased the "singing" sound; third, the cake should have shrunk slightly from the sides of the pan; fourth, the surface of the cake, when pressed lightly with the finger, should spring back and leave no imprint if it is done; fifth, a wire cake tester or a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake should come out clean and dry if the cake is done.

After baking, butter cakes should be inverted on a cake rack and allowed to stand for about five minutes before the pan is removed.

It may be advisable to run a spatula or a knife around the outside of the cake to loosen it from the pan before inverting. Sponge and angel food cakes should not be loosened from the pan while warm, as this will cause them to shrink. They should be inverted and allowed to hang in the pan for one hour, or until cold.

High Altitude Baking
At high altitude there should be a slight reduction of the baking powder and sugar given in cake recipes and the liquid may need to be increased a little. The baking temperature should be a little higher. This chart for higher altitudes has been found satisfactory: �JUNE 1948

BADGE OF TRIUMPH
Maryhale Woolsey
I saw them but once, in passing by.
Twin little shacks in a mining town.
They sat side by side like gray old dames,
Each in a shabby and faded gown.
And one cringed hopelessly, bowed to doom;
But one had a heart that was brave and gay.
(In one little moment I saw them so,
For only once did I pass that way.)

How did I know?
Why, this was the sign:
The house that held courage and laughter still,
Waved bright ruffled curtains to greet the breeze,
And tulips bloomed on its window sill.

THEN AND NOW
Della Adams Leitner
When I was young and dreams were all romantic,
My lover was so handsome, brave and tall,
Wooing with constant ardor and devotion,
With eager haste responsive to love's call.
The years have passed; John sits before the fire
Warming his slippered feet that feel the cold.

He's bald and thin and short and rather stubborn, but kind and true— and I am gray and old.
How time has changed my girlhood's fond delusion, but I am not unhappy, for it seems Life gave me more than I had asked in finding Companionship beyond my cherished dreams.

Pressed-Flower Pictures
A FEW SIMPLIFIED HINTS FOR BEGINNERS
Dorothy J. Roberts

The hands of frugal housewives have long preserved the fruits of summer for winter appetites. Why should not then the fingers of the garden lover preserve the blossoms of the season for beauty-hungry eyes, since, as the poet Housman says, ". . . to look at things in bloom, fifty springs are little room."

Many flowers may be enjoyed beyond the brief period of their blooming by a bit of careful preparation and the whole family can participate in this pleasurable pastime. Have you ever seen a pressed-flower picture, or, more fun still, have you ever made one? Not only are these pictures delightful variations to hang upon your own walls, but they make charming gifts.

When the family become interested, they will, voluntarily, turn collectors and bring home from neighbors, relatives and friends, specimens not found in your own garden. Experimentation will soon prove which flowers hold their form and color best through the process of pressing. But press them in abundance, since the greater the variety of flowers, the more opportunities they afford for the making of satisfactory compositions.

The making of pressed-flower pictures has extensive possibilities in the field as well as in the commercial field. However, here only a few suggestions are given for those wishing to try a hand at a new hobby. Flowers should be pressed in warm, dry weather, or they tend to lose color and turn brown. They should be picked in their prime and pressed immediately. For this purpose have at hand a number of old books and a few heavy rocks to use as weights. One book will press several flowers. Old volumes may be purchased from used-book counters at small cost for this unscholarly purpose.

Remember the old adage, "As the twig is bent . . ." for, as you place the flowers between the leaves of the book, so you will find them shaped when they become dry. Arrange the petals in the most graceful way, with about an inch or more margin at the top and bottom of the page. Then close the book and compress for a moment before placing the next flower. When the book is filled, weight it with a rock or other books and a rock. Let them stand undisturbed until dry—a period of two weeks or more.

Small rock-garden plants, blue Veronica, white rock-garden spirea, and many others are dainty when pressed. Miniature roses and buds, clusters of climbing rosebuds, the pink ones, especially, are exquisite. Columbine, pinks, larkspur of all colors, Valeriana, small zinnias, and all daisies are good material. Pansies, carefully pressed, are bright and colorful. Sweet peas, especially white ones, are translucent and ethereal. Snapdragons are rich and full-bodied but require special pressure. Delphiniums are particularly delightful to work with, either in flowerets, or using the whole stock, because of their lovely shades of blue. Yellow, pink, and blue hold color well. Some reds and orchids tend to darken slightly.

As beginners, try pressing types of flowers which are not too heavy, such as large roses, nor too fragile, such as nasturtiums. By the end of your pressing season, you should have gathered, in your spare moments, a few interesting picture frames from dime stores or used-furniture marts. For the beginner, not wishing to make his own frames and not quite ready to attempt large, elaborate pictures, small, quaint, decorative frames are most suitable. A distinctive and inexpensive one is of dark mahogany, about an inch wide, with gilt beading at the inner edge.

Other supplies needed are a few 8 x 12-inch sheets of good drawing paper to use as backgrounds for your flower compositions. When you are ready for the framing, have this equipment at your elbow: a pair of pliers, a supply of small picture framing nails, a spool of thread and, if desired, a few hand-tied bows of pastel colored velvet baby ribbon to place near the stem ends.

When flowers and materials are ready, and you have a long, free, sunny day, prepare yourself for an uninterrupted period of delightful concentration. You will find that the children can, with your help, work out some attractive pictures of their own. Prepare frames by drawing out the nails with pliers from the backs of the pictures. Remove the glass and lay it aside until needed, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1948 discard the picture of the movie celebrity and keep the cardboard backing. Cut the drawing paper to fit the cardboard and on this drawing paper, fitted over the cardboard, build your picture.

Distribute your beauty crop of pressed flowers carefully over a white sheet on a large table where light is favorable and abundant. Spread the flowers in one layer so that you can see them all at a glance, for you will need to try out many combinations before finding the arrangement that is most pleasing. You will learn to keep each picture in one mood, that is, to select flowers agreeable in size, form and color, upon a harmonizing background. Do not use flowers too sparingly; have a substantial mass of color and pattern on your paper.

For example, try a group of tiny pink rosebuds and blue delphinium flowerets on a background of white sweet peas and white rock garden spirea with fine blue Veronica at the edges. Build this on a white background, with a perky blue bow laid lightly near the stem ends, if desired. Pansies of varied purples and golds are effective on a pale green or pale orchid background.

When you have worked out a pleasing picture, place the glass carefully over it, pressing firmly on the glass with the right hand to hold the flowers in place. With the left hand, gently push the entire picture to the edge of the table so that the glass protrudes about two inches beyond the table edge. Then place the left hand under the protruding edge of the picture and, still pressing the top of the glass with the right hand, turn the entire picture upside down on the table.

Now, pressing the spool against the head of the nail, Page 409

RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE
THE GRADUATE NURSE Olive C. Wehr

I saw you graduate last night—
A girl grown woman-wise,
Arrayed in emblematic white,
With stars deep in your eyes!

I saw you moving down the years,
Serene and unafraid,
While easing pain, dispelling fears,
And working undismayed.

Though holding in your cool, strong hands
A trembling life; nor yet
Complaining of the day's demands
While evening stars had set.

In touch with all life's mystery,
Whether of death or birth
And failing not in sympathy—
An angel come to earth!

I saw you graduate last night;
I paused to smile and nod,
And say how well you looked in white—
And now you work with God!

HEARTBREAK Cherry McKay Hearts but seldom break in sudden sorrow; Only the rending years can tear apart The sturdy faith that on some crimson morrow Life once more will prime the pulseless heart. But if a heart holds tears unspilled, and captures All the past, to bind it with love- thongs, That heart may burst in a valley-spring of raptures, And filtered tears pour through in sudden songs.

Questing Lights Belle Watson Anderson Chapter 3 Synopsis: Andrew Rumgay leaves his mother and his fiancée Jane Allison in Scotland and joins his friend Hugh Shand to emigrate to America. They meet Mother MacKinlay and her son Bob whom they had known while doing missionary work, and also become acquainted with Kathleen Coleman and her friend Margaret Purvis. Hugh and Kathleen are married on board the ship.

As the early, glimmering dawn softly silvered the Iowa prairies, a camp, with a large central tent surrounded by many smaller tents, was revealed near the banks of a winding stream. Three miles north of Iowa City on a spot where the grass was long and tender, the Woods company had camped the night before. They had come from New York City on the train and now were resting on the land purchased by the Church for the use of emigrants on their long journey to the Salt Lake Valley.

The men of the Woods encampment were up at daylight. There was work to be done. It was getting late in the year, almost too late to begin a journey to a mountainous country far away—there was no time to lose. The camp life was different from the limited activities of the ship and train, and the emigrants were very grateful for the change. There was fresh, pure air to breathe, clean living quarters, and a variety of food, vegetables and fruit from the farmers' gardens, wild berries growing on the prairies, fish in the streams, and abundant game on every side.

Hugh and Andrew brought in dry wood to burn. They knew what the women would call for as soon as they put their heads out of their tent doors, and it wasn't very long until they began appearing like bees coming out of their hives for the day's supply of honey. Then there was a call for prayer, and right after breakfast a priesthood meeting. Everything must be planned and work assigned at once. Some of the men would leave early next day to buy provisions, material for building handcarts, wagons, cattle, horses, and oxen for the trek. All the other men would go to work for the farmers. The women would wash and mend the bedding and clothing.

Andrew came in to dinner. "Well, Mother Mac, we'll be up and leaving for work at daylight in the morning. The farmers have even asked us over to breakfast." "But not too early in the morning. Sonny, we're having those prairie chickens for supper tomorrow night and the fish for breakfast the next morning." "What prairie chickens? What fish?" asked Andrew. "What is going on around here? I thought I was the head of this house?" "Not while I'm around, Brother Rumgay. You may have your place, but it isn't preparing the meals. Hugh is out getting the chickens. Father Coleman and Bob are catching the fish." "We hope," Andrew returned wistfully. "Well you just couldn't stay away tomorrow night. 'Tomorrow is Margaret's birthday. She'll be twenty-two years old." "Not so loud, Mother, not so loud, young ladies do not like their ages shouted about. That's why they fix up so much—why Margaret's only a few months younger than I am." "Yes, and she looks it too. Margaret is a very pretty lass, and I'm making a grand birthday dinner for her—saleratus biscuits, breasts of the prairie chickens fried to a turn, gravy, and green corn, crab-apple dumplings, boiled. Now, will you be home for dinner?" "Just try and keep me away. How did you catch on to the way of cooking these American dishes? It is plain to see what women talk about when they are alone."

Bob and Brother Coleman came in with a long string of fish. Also, they had picked a beautiful bouquet of flowers, wild sweet williams, prairie lilies, and windflowers. "See what I mean, Andrew? These are for the party," said Mother Mac. Margaret came over early the next morning to help Mother with the work. "Happy birthday, my dear, and many happy returns of the day." Mother put her arms around the young lady and gave her a good hug and a squeeze for good measure. "Thanks, dear Mother Mac, you have a heart big enough for the whole world."

RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1948

"Well, it will be a queer world, Margaret darling, when a mother stops loving her own children. I hope that will never happen to me." "It's a wonderful thing someone can love me," Margaret answered.

Mother stopped her work. "Now look here, dearie, you're not building up a lot of heartaches for yourself, are you, now? You know Andrew likes all the girls in the company, Scotch girls, and all the others, but he's in love with Jane, you know that. He'll always be true. V her, so if IT were you I'd forget all about him. There are so many young men in the company, Brother Nelson, Brother Walker, and oh, so many others."

"So many others, and yet when I marry it's going to be to a Scotchman, who will look just like Andrew Rumgay." "Oh, it's so foolish, Margaret, so very foolish."

"So foolish, when I love the very ground he walks on? I didn't know there were men like him in the world. All the men I knew were those who worked in the factory, common, rough, uncouth men, whose ideas of women were the world's concepts. Then I meet a man who puts women on a pedestal, something to be cherished, cared for, loved—I may be foolish, but I will love him till I die."

Bob and Brother Coleman had brought in a stack of logs for a bonfire. After supper the women washed the dishes, sang songs, played games, and then decided to go to bed. Mother Mac would be up early to fry the fish for the boys before they went to work.

Some of the men had raised the question about going on to the QUESTING LIGHTS Valley this summer. If the fall was about as usual everything would be all right; they would have plenty of time to make it into the Salt Lake Valley.

Andrew came out of the Woods tent into the night's fairy firelight. A beautiful night, a beautiful girl walked over to the fire. "Where are the others, Margaret? Am I so very late? Did we spoil the party?" "No, Mother Mac wanted to get up early to fry the fish. Kathleen was tired, and I am too excited to sleep."

I have just now finished my diary, a little dizzy when I think of the rocking of the boat, but on the whole no worse for wear, even when I think of you and the conductor on the train. Andrew—I laugh right out loud each time I think of you and that giant conductor, almost having a fight."

"That was so uncalled for, Margaret. You never make a wrong right by adding another wrong."
Margaret, still laughing, added, "But you have to figure. Brother Rumgay, that first, last, and all the time, you are a Scotchman. Then all the trimmings come after that—and those Scotch tempers! Oh! Oh!"
"That's one reason the crew were so mean, all along the way, the Scotch pay for their tempers."
"Well, I see Kathleen left the tent flap open for me, so I'm off to bed. You will need your rest so you can work tomorrow, and you'll need to take it easy the first few days, Andrew, till you get a little used to the work. Good night."
Andrew sat and gazed about him till the fire went out. Night in America—no sound but the babbling of the water, and the rustling of corn in the distance.
Margaret stayed with Mother while the men were away. Kathleen had Brother Coleman to cook for. He had stayed from the fields to bring water and wood for the women's washings. But the women found both on the banks of the stream. They washed for days and hung their clean white clothes on the bushes.

"What is more downright satisfying than a pretty, white wash flying in the breeze?" Mother looked and looked at the clothes. "You ken, Margaret, they'll be up in the morning that beat the Scotch women 414 washing. The American women's clothes aren't a bit whiter than ours."

That evening they sat around the campfire in deep conversation. Kathleen joined them after supper, and sat down very close to Mother, snuggled up under her arm.

"I'm going to tell you the sweetest story a woman ever told." Kathleen pulled Mother's arm around her for protection, for support. "We're going to have a baby."

Margaret got up and moved to the other side of Kathleen, so they would not need to talk in whispers. This was something special, something sacred.

"Are you a tiny bit scared, Kathleen, because we are on the plains?" 

"No, not one bit, Margaret. Other women are having their children, why shouldn't I have mine? Nearly every week a baby is born. Why should I be frightened? Nothing ever happens by chance. God will take care of me and the baby. I wonder if it will be a boy or a girl. If it's a boy we'll call him Andrew, because Hugh and Andrew are such good friends. It it's a girl I'd like to call her after both of you, but how can 1?"

"We'd better choose a name your daughter would approve of, Kathleen," Margaret suggested.

"Think how wonderful to have a daughter like you, Margaret! I would like her to be just like you!"

"That's the sweetest compliment I was ever paid. Thanks, Kathleen."

Hugh and Andrew were anxious to learn everything about building handcarts and repairing wagons, so they left the farm work to the RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1948 others of their ward. It was very hard to get the handcarts ready for the road. The wheels were faulty; material in many instances was poor. Finally, after weeks of hard work, most of the handcarts were ready.

The day had been spent in packing wagons and handcarts. Tomorrow the mules and ponies would be packed and all would be ready for the trail, but Andrew was still working on his handcart. The wood was so dry and hard that when he thought it was all finished, something else would happen.

"Look at it, Andrew," Hugh said, "the worst one in the bunch. Why did you choose that one?"

"Well, we couldn't leave it behind. We need handcarts so badly and it may as well be mine. I hope it stays with me to the end of the road."

"But you have your doubts. So have I," Hugh said as he gave one of the wheels a last hard shake.

The next morning Brother Woods pulled out with the first wagon. Brother Nelson led with the handcarts, and Brother Rumgay was the last to leave camp.

"The last, the best of all the game," Margaret offered, "but who wants to be the last one?"

"Andrew, you're bothered this morning." Mother Mac looked anxiously at him. "Come now, what's on your mind?" Andrew tried to smile and pass it off, but Mother was determined.

"Well, we were told to bring only the necessities, but books have been as necessary to me as my food. I can't take them. There isn't room for them. I'll have to leave them in father's kist."

"If we divide them, and each of us takes a few, Andrew, then we could take them, couldn't we?" asked Margaret.

"No, there just isn't room for them. Hugh and I have tried to figure a way out, but it can't be done. Every tiny space must be used for food. A handcart isn't very large, you know, and if it's too heavy it will be too hard to pull. Lots of other things to worry about, but I've never been without my books."

"We all love them, don't we, Hugh?" Kathleen added, in sympathy.

"Yes, we recall my sick days aboard the ship, and the help and consolation they brought us," Hugh spoke gratefully.

"Well, maybe someone who appreciates books will find them. They may prove to be good missionaries." Margaret was trying to add a note of cheer.

"I'll look around and see that everything is taken care of. You folks go on up the line. No need for us all to stay behind," Hugh suggested.

Bob and Brother Coleman went with Andrew to see that all the fires were out and nothing was left behind. Everything was in order. Now they could All take to, the road.

THEY spent the first hours getting adjusted to pulling their handcarts. Even in this they found there was a great art. They passed many sloughs and swamps, and had to be very careful to stay on the road. The corn, just coming into tassel, reminded the saints of the quick passing of the summer days.

"The fields of growing corn, dependent on the sun and the rain for their growth, suggest to me our 415 dependence upon our Heavenly Father," Kathleen said.

"Yes," Margaret replied, "and if God cares for the corn in the field, and provides for its welfare, how much more can his children trust him for their security, even on a Strange road in a strange country."

"God is taking care of us, I'm sure," affirmed Mother Mac. "I have felt his helpful influence many times since leaving home."

That night Mother, Margaret, and Kathleen came hobbling into camp. They went over to the creek, removed their shoes and stockings, and soaked their feet in the cool water.

"What a relief!" Margaret cried, giving vent to a heavy sigh. Kathleen was worried. "What on earth will we do, walking every day, and our feet in this condition?" "Nature is a wonderful doctor," Mother assured her: "In a day or two our feet will be better than ever, strong for the strain and exercise they must take." But the women were late with supper that night and could hardly have managed at all without the help of Brother Coleman. Andrew and Hugh worked on the handcarts that had broken down during the day. Bob helped with the herding, spreading out the horses and cattle as far as possible, so they would get in enough grazing before dark. The grass was abundant, and the animals tired and hungry after their first day's full haul.

Each day the emigrants traveled more miles, and their muscles seemed to adjust themselves to the strain and work of the road, for, as Mother Mac said, "Nature is a wonderful friend to take with you on a journey." Each day they were hungry and ready for their food. They constantly breathed the clean, pure air of the prairies and it was not long before even the old men and women could take the day's advance in comfort. They left the cabins and corn and all cultivation behind them. Their way was through miles of prairie, with only nature's primitive gifts of land and sky. Silence lay before them, behind them, and was with them every moment.

One day Margaret said, "Even the people have become silent. It seems that there is nothing to be said. Behind us lie our yesterdays marked by a tuft of grass, a tree, or a creek of water. Before us lie our tomorrows, rising each day from the bed the sun has used the night before to sleep in."

"Yes, even I have been quiet longer than for anytime in my life," Mother responded. "Every mile and every hour are filled with the throbbing rhythm of the land and the ever-changing pictures in the sky. The atmosphere is heavy-laden with beautiful thoughts, but no words." "The birds are satisfied to fly from tree to tree. They may sing to their young, but we do not hear them."

Kathleen was expressing the longing of her heart. Margaret was thinking that perhaps the silence of the land was the expression of the future. A lovely dream that could have become a reality would always lie dormant and silent because the love she longed for would be claimed by another. She thought of the homes that some day would be built upon these silent acres in response to the plow and the farmer's song, awakening the land and bringing the vibrant voices of happy children to the melody of busy reapers.

As they passed silently on towards night, clouds appeared in the west. (To be continued)

SONG FOR A DAUGHTER
Margery S. Stewart watched you running across the road From school, like a blown leaf or flower, Tree shadows on your face.
You paused To shake the lilac, laughing under shower Of cupped rain. How tall you seemed, How frail your fingers and how bright Your hair. Childhood gone, like laughter Lost...
Years out of sound and sight.
In the sun, holding your face to summer, I watched you turn and bend. You called my name and in your voice I heard The love of friend for friend.

Sister Rudd comments: "Note the old checkered tablecloth, the coal oil lamp, the great ornate Bible, the picture of the Prophet, and the authentic costumes of the sisters. The group found Emma Smith to be greatly worried over the sufferings of her husband, incarcerated in jail, but the other women consoled her. They read letters received from the Prophet. Later, two sisters dropped in on their way from singing practice. They were urged to sing and agreed, providing Sister Kimball would accompany them on the organ. This she did while they sang "Jesus, Lover of My Soul" and the Prophet's beloved hymn "A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief." With this music, the Nauvoo sisters again departed into the past. Then the literature class discussed, with deepened appreciation, that great soul, Joseph Smith and his inspiring letters."

428 A House By Friday (Continued from page 384) blues, and reds. I gave one look and knew it was not for me.

THAT night, more in desperation than in hope, we rode by the Lomas house. It was lighted, and after much bell ringing and waiting, we were admitted. The owner was there, assisted by three maids. Feverishly she told us that an American doctor, with no children, would occupy the house manana en la manana. We went quietly out. It was Thursday morning and I had one place left, an apartment far out. It was occupied by an American lady who was moving soon, the agency said.

The lady received me; the apartment was all that one could wish, even to the lovely hued Mexican hand-woven rugs and the blonde furniture. There was only one drawback: the lady would not vacate until she could find a house for the same price. She had been looking for six months. The end of my list had been reached.

There were still some apartments in the heart of the town, but we were not going to investigate them, even as a last resort. I made a quick decision. Calling to the driver, I showed him the address on Aguas Calientes. "Si, Senora," he said, wheeling his car about. The Senora was home and she led me into the walled garden. This time I did not allow her to lead the conversation. I sat firmly on the cold tile seat and asked if we could have the house.

A HOUSE BY FRIDAY "Are you certain you wish it?" she asked anxiously. "It is too much for me, too upsetting of the head and heart, too much work for the maids, to have to rent it again soon. You will be satisfied? You will not want everything changed?"

"No," I said, so happy I was scarcely breathing. "It is my house. I felt it as soon as I saw it. Each night I have said a little prayer that if it were right for us to have it, you would say yes."

Her eyes grew soft. "Each night I, too, have said my little prayer that I would find the right ones to live in my house." Her face brightened. "You may have the house if you wish it." Tomorrow, she said, was short notice, but we could move in. If the maids could not have everything in readiness, we could be patient, no?

At night we came to arrange about the lease. It would be ready in a day or two, she told us. She came to a quick understanding with my husband about the Diplomatic Proviso. Then he drew out his checkbook to pay the first month's rent. She waived it aside. Time enough to pay it, she insisted, when we were settled and the lease signed.

The moon was shining when we passed through the garden. We stood by the fountain, savoring this moment when we no longer felt like intruders in an alien land. The difficult part of our Mexican move was over.

"Yes," Mr. Tarlock said to one of the American men we met as we passed through the lobby with our bags the next day, "we have our house. Got here on Friday night and we're moving in this Friday noon. My wife did it all herself, too. Couldn't speak a word of Spanish, either. Just had to let herself go and she did it."

430 You Can Write a Prize Winner (Continued from page 373) children; an individual should struggle for survival. Abnormal reactions require such insight and sympathy and skill in portrayal that the novice butchers them and makes them ugly or ridiculous or unconvincing. Just one more word�as to length. Use just enough words to tell the story. Start at the initial situation, tight spang-bang in the thing that sets the story going. If it is necessary to tell what happened before this, give it in short "flash-backs" sandwiched in between bits of forward moving action. And stop when the emotional experience has been realized by the characters. Never go on to tell how it affected the next generation or the cousins in Duluth or Timbuctu.

And there it is�for what it is worth�and may some of those exciting and illuminating stories be written now.

May I compliment you on the beauti-ful poetry the Magazine contains. It is heartening for those of us who write to find publications of your caliber using verse. I especially liked "For Some Ap-pointed Reason" by Berta Huish Christen-sen and "Too Frail a Lute" by Eva Willes Wangsgaard in the February (1948) issue. � Elaine Swain, Vallejo, California I am a convert to the Church and have been in America since 1923. I have taken the Magazine since 1927 when my first poem was published and loved it ever since, and suspect I shall all my life. I am English, but I dearly love the temple spires, the snow-capped mountains, and the beau-tiful new, white [aluminum] roof of the Tabernacle. � Helen Hall McQuarrie, Salt Lake City, Utah We do appreciate the inspiration that the general board gives to us in various ways. The March Relief Society Magazine alone is worth the $1.50 for a year's sub-scription. Every person I have talked with since it came I have encouraged to read it from cover to cover. � Jennie M. Butler, Secretary Snowflake Stake Relief Society (Arizona) Page 432 Allow me to send greetings from the heart of Europe. So many things have happened in this small country within the past few months. May I say that the Maga-zine brings me a great deal of joy at this time, since it keeps us up to date on Relief Society affairs at home. The Magazine is one of the fine publications that comes through the censor and I do enjoy reading its uplifting and educational contents. � Martha S. Toronto, President Czechoslovakian Mission Relief Society Prague Thank you for publishing my story "A New Stove for Mother" in the April Magazine. It was really an honor to have it included in that issue. I enjoyed read-ing the stories by the other ladies. As I was reading, I thought how nice it would be to meet and know some of the other writers who help make up the Magazine. I truly appreciate the help and encourage-ment which the editors have given me. � Norma Wrathall, Grantsville, Utah INEZ WHITLOCK MAKES 150 QUILT TOPS FOR RELIEF SOCIETY During the past ten years.
