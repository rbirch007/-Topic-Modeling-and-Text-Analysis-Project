SNOW UPON THE EARTH Christie Lund Coles

How white and still this snow upon the earth,
A benediction over hill and plain
Of winter-weary days.
The riotous birth
Of spring, with blossoms honey-sweet again,
Is not more beautiful than this; no scene
Of flowered summer nor autumnal fire
Surpasses these bejeweled webs that lean
Earthward in their white, virginal attire.

For here is peace and silver quietness
For the being moved too much by revelry
In April, and the wanton loveliness
Of Indian summer. It is good to be
Silent, growing strong in growing still,
Retrieving life and strength, as field and hill.

Happy New Year!

HE General Board of Relief Society extends this wish, with all that it implies, to all Relief Society officers, members, and Magazine readers throughout the world.
We sincerely thank all of the officers, members, and friends of the Society the world over, for their loyalty and devotion to the great cause of Relief Society during the past year. We greatly appreciate the many courtesies shown the members of the General Board in their visits to the stakes.

Amid the rapid tempo of modern life with its growing complexities and anxieties, let us realize more than ever before that happiness, peace, and serenity come from within.
Let us make sure we are building our lives and our homes on a firm foundation of spirituality, and of faith in God and in the gospel of Jesus Christ.
May we face the New Year with its unknown problems with faith and courage, and may the Lord bless and sustain us in all of our righteous endeavors.

Affectionately yours,
Belle S. Spafford

General Presidency
Pioneer Women
President David O. McKay
Of the First Presidency (Delivered at the afternoon session of the Annual Relief Society General Conference held in the Tabernacle, Thursday, October 2, 1947.)

SISTERS, Visiting Brethren,
the sweet perfume that radiates from these lovely leis, graciously presented by the President of the Oahu Stake in Hawaii, but typifies the sweet spirit of spirituality that radiates from this large audience of Relief Society workers.

When I think of the ideals you represent, as offered in the Relief Societies of the Church—self-improvement, perpetuation and beautification of home, preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ, service, not only to those in distress but to everyone who needs your tender care—I do not hesitate to say that this is one of the most significant gatherings, if not the most significant assembly of women in the world. I am glad to be with you. It is an inspiration to partake of your spirit.

We have listened to inspirational addresses from your fellow workers, representatives of the General Board, this inspirational singing from our Singing Mothers.
The ideals represented here cannot help but make everyone present feel that it is good to be here.

I know from the papers and from your program that you have had definite instruction regarding your work meeting and your literary lessons, your religious themes, social service, and all the other features of Relief Society work. Indeed, if I would I could not instruct you on these details, as I am not sufficiently informed.
I have, therefore, directed my attention along the lines suggested by Sister Spafford and her associates on the part that women have played in the Centennial, and my thoughts have not centered so much on what women have done throughout the counties (although their labors are inestimable and to them we owe the success, largely, of these great county celebrations that have been carried on during this Centennial Year), as upon the pioneer women who contributed so much and endured so much during those trying days of Nauvoo and during the trek to Salt Lake Valley.

In paying tribute to them we shall pay tribute to all womankind, especially to women in the Church, for they are just as loyal today as they were then.
As the Utah Centennial celebration draws to a close, it seems appropriate to pause a moment to pay tribute to these pioneer women. And well do they merit infinitely more than our feeble efforts can give them.
Their fitting praise requires the best that fluent tongues and gifted pens can express.

You will find few if any of their names inscribed on monuments erected to the brave. Some are not even known beyond their family circles; not a few lie in unmarked graves out on the plains, but the burdens they bore uncomplainingly,
PIONEER WOMEN
the contributions they made to the settlement of the arid West, the virtues they exemplified in the midst of trials and almost super-human endurance entitle them to an honored place among the heroines of the world.

We confess that during this Centennial we have not laid much emphasis upon the part that women played in the settlement of this Western Empire. In this we are but following the general practice of men throughout the ages.
Women bear the burdens of the household, carry most of the responsibility of rearing a family, inspire their husbands and sons to achieve success; and while the latter are being given the applause of public acclaim, the wives and mothers who really merit recognition and commendation remain smilingly content in unheralded achievement.

In the words of Jack Appleton:
"A man succeeds and reaps the honors of public applause when in truth a quiet little woman has made it all possible—has by her tact and encouragement held him to his best, has had faith in him when his own faith has languished, has cheered him with the unfailing assurance: 'You can, you must, you will.'"

Broken by Fate, unrelenting,
Scarred by the lashings of Chance;
Bitter his heart—unrepenting—
Hardened by Circumstance;
Shadowed by Failure ever,
Cursing, he would have died,
But the touch of her hand, her strong warm hand,
And her love of his soul, took full command,
Just at the turn of the tide!
Standing beside him, filled with trust,
"Win," she whispered, "you must, you must!"
Helping, and loving and guiding,
Urging when that were best,
Holding her fears in hiding,
Deep in her quiet breast;
This is the woman who kept him
True to his standards high,
Watching, and guarding, whispering still,
"Win, you can, you must, you will!"

This is the story of the ages,
This is Woman's way;
Wiser than seers or sages,
Lifting us day by day;
Facing all things with courage
Nothing can daunt or dim,
Treading Life's path, wherever it leads—
Lined with flowers or choked with weeds,
But ever with him—with him!

Guidon—comrade—golden spur—
The men who win are helped by her!

They admire beautiful things. They like to dress becomingly. 'They admire china and silverware. 'They enjoy decorating their rooms and making homes livable and attractive. They appreciate an occasional gift of jewelry, of a piece of Royal Doulton or of Dresden. The pioneer woman and her associates who entered Salt Lake Valley one hundred years ago enjoyed none of these luxuries. They had to be content, and were content with the mere necessities. With these inherent tendencies of womankind in mind, let me invite you, with the facts of history before us, to recross the plains with two or three of these heroines. 'Those to whom we refer this afternoon are but representatives of thousands to whom tribute is due. One of the most tragically heroic epochs in Church history, one in which are exemplified the dauntless faith and divine leadership of the men at the head of the Church, and the super-human, sublime patience, and resourcefulness of the women, is the period following the expulsion of the saints from Nauvoo, and the building of Winter Quarters on the banks of the Missouri. Most of our attention this year has been directed to the trek from Winter Quarters to Salt Lake Valley, but I think the greatest heroism of the Church, manifestations of the greatest leadership, and loyalty to Church and to ideals of the women, occurred between the months of February and September of 1846. The story of that trek has never yet been fully told. It is difficult for us who attempt to pay a feeble tribute to these pioneers one hundred years later, even to imagine, for example, what those shelterless mothers endured during the month of February 1846—note the month—as they passed through the throes of confinement on the banks of the Sugar Creek when nine babies were born. You mothers can understand this better than we men. The world will do well to pause and think what it was that inspired the women to endure uncomplainingly such trials. Picturing the scene, Eliza R. Snow writes: "We had been preceded from Nauvoo by thousands, and I was informed that on the first night of the encampment, nine children were born into the world, and from that time, as we journeyed onward, mothers gave birth to offspring under almost every variety of circumstances imaginable, except those to which they had been accustomed; some in tents, others in wagons—in rainstorms and in snowstorms. I heard of one birth which occurred under the rude shelter of a hut, the sides of which were formed of blankets fastened to poles stuck in the ground, with a bark roof through which the rain was dripping. Kind sisters stood holding dishes to catch the water as it fell, thus protecting the newcomer and its mother from a showerbath as the little innocent first entered on the stage of human life; and through faith in the Great Ruler of events, no harm resulted to either." In that month, women, driven from their comfortable homes in Nauvoo, left their land, which many of them could not sell, abandoned household furniture, treasured pictures and accumulated relics, left the old clock ticking a gloomy farewell, taking nothing with which they could do without, crossed the Mississippi River to begin a trackless journey, and to endure the hardships incident to camping in the open it on muddy ground, under inclement, often stormy skies, with inadequate provisions and clothing. Picture this afternoon, if you can—and this is a real incident—a young mother with the care and responsibility of three children—a girl of seven, a boy of five, and a baby boy one and one-half years old, subjected to these adverse conditions. On her and her little children, on February 6 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1948 PIONEER WOMEN 25, three inches of snow fell. Only tents and wagon boxes for shelter. The diaries of that day tell us that this mother and babies, as many others, had to sleep out of doors as the wagon boxes were loaded with food and with what few household necessities the refugees could take along. Time will not permit me to pause longer on that journey across Iowa. They reached Mount Pisgah in due time, stayed there until fall, then joined the saints at Winter Quarters and prepared to cross the plains next year. Now I am going to ask you to consider conditions ten years later. Thousands of women by that time had walked across the plains, your grandmothers and mine among them, and many of them prompted to do that out of consideration for widows who could not come any other way, so they shared the wagon and let the widow ride while they walked. "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me." But ten years later they had instituted, or inaugurated the handcart method of crossing the plains. Today, that just seems to me—I do not know—almost incomprehensible, but they fitted out their handcarts at Winter Quarters, loaded each with such household goods and such food as they could, took the cattle and drove them along, and marched across the plains singing that inspiring song with which you opened this gathering, "Come, Come, Ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear, but with joy wend your way." Wives pulling and pushing handcarts, aiding their husbands, while little children trudged at their sides! But in that year of 1856 two companies were delayed. They were advised not to attempt the trip. It was too late. One man who had crossed called them together and said: "You had better wait." But the majority voted to attempt it, and he said: "All right, if you are determined to go I will go with you and help you; if necessary, die with you." "Greater love, hath no man, than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." The next morning a young wife and mother stood by the side of a newly dug grave, the final resting place of her husband and fourteen others who had taken the last step on life's journey. One of those put in that grave had helped to dig it the night before. One of the mother's arms caressed a little boy sorrowfully sobbing as he buried his face in the folds of his mother's dress. You and I cannot even imagine the aching sorrow and poignant grief that must have filled that young woman's heart as she and her little son pulled their handcart that day without husband and daddy. Later, in the month of September, at the close of the day's march, a bride of twelve months gave birth to a baby girl. The records do not say whether the company halted for the mother to recuperate. If they did, it would be only for a day or two, and the young mother would have to trudge along carrying in her arms, or placing it on the handcart, her newborn babe. What a picture for an artist! What an appeal to the skeptical, indifferent world today! What an illustration of heroism and faith!

Illustrative of this last thought, I am going to tell you what that father said about it, years afterward, for the father, mother, and baby came to Utah, and it was my privilege to sit at the table of that little baby girl when she was grown, and hear the story from her own lips. She was living in a comfortable home with nine lovely children around her. In that same town, years later, a teacher, conducting a class, said it was unwise ever to attempt, even to permit them to come across the plains under such conditions. "Some sharp criticism of the Church and its leaders was being indulged in for permitting any company of converts to venture across the plains with no more supplies or protection than a handcart caravan afforded." An old man in the corner"�and this was written by President William Palmer, who was present"�"sat silent and listened as long as he could stand it, then he arose and said things that no person who heard him will ever forget. His face was white with emotion, yet he spoke calmly, deliberately, but with great earnestness and sincerity.

"In substance the father above mentioned said, 'I ask you to stop this criticism. You are discussing a matter you know nothing about. Cold historic facts mean nothing here, for they give no proper interpretation of the questions involved. Mistake to send the Handcart Company out so late in the season? Yes. But I was in that company and my wife was in it and Sister Nellie Unthank whom you have cited was there, too. We suffered beyond anything you can imagine," RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�JANUARY 1948 "and many died of exposure and starvation, but did you ever hear a survivor of that company utter a word of criticism? Not one of that company ever apostatized or left the Church, because everyone of us came through with the absolute knowledge that God lives for we became acquainted with him in our extremities."

"I have pulled my handcart when I was so weak and weary from illness and lack of food that I could hardly put one foot ahead of the other. I have looked ahead and seen a patch of sand or a hill slope and I have said, 'I can go only that far and there I must give up, for I cannot pull the load through it.' And a wife with a baby in her arms by his side! 'I have gone on to that sand and when I reached it, the cart began pushing me. I have looked back many times to see who was pushing my cart, but my eyes saw no one. I knew then that the angels of God were there.'

"Was I sorry that I chose to come by handcart? No. Neither then nor any minute of my life since. The price we paid to become acquainted with God was a privilege to pay, and I am thankful that I was privileged to come in the Martin Handcart Company."

TODAY, Sisters, we have hospitals, anesthetics, nurses, and every comfort and attention for mother and the newborn child. Yet many a woman of America today limits her family to one, two, or three children, sometimes justifying herself because of economic conditions. They cannot get houses in which to live; the husband is in school; but more often they are yielding to a desire to keep up social prestige, and to participate in entertainment and travel.

The pioneer women bore the responsibilities of large families even though they had to pass through the throes of confinement under the most adverse circumstances. This tendency to limit the number of children in a family, if considered only in the light of perpetuating the race, is most portentous. We are told by the president of the American Statistical Association that in order to maintain our population even at its present level, it would be necessary that each family which has any children should have an average of over three.

"In other words, so many people are unmarried or else have no children, though married, that this number of children is needed to balance the deaths, and thus maintain a stationary population without any growth from year to year." The increasing tendency to look upon family life as a burden, and the ever-spreading practice of birth control are ominous threats to the perpetuation of our nation.

In the light of what the restored gospel teaches us regarding pre-existence, the eternal nature of the marriage covenant, and of family relationship, no healthy wife in the Church should shun the responsibilities of normal motherhood. In our homes, as we have heard here today, all that is best and noblest should live. And this in most cases largely emanates from mother. Her "daily movements," as impressively expressed in Woman in the Home, "as she walks and sits and sings and serves, turn common life into a drama of grace, beauty, and power. And when mother's heart, full of mother's love, obeys the inspiration of good taste, the living room of the lowliest house becomes a stage on which are illustrated, under the spell of holy faith and morality, all that is best in human life.... Who dares to undervalue it?"

Today, on the stage of international politics a great contention is taking place between two ideologies�one, that we take the children and make them hostages or wards of the state; the other, that upholds the Christian home. God grant that his will may prevail in the present conflict.

To womanhood everywhere, and especially to those in the West who prize their heritage, may the memory of the sterling character and heroic deeds of our pioneer mothers be an inspiration to foster and practice in their daily lives, courage, modesty, virtue, loyalty, and faith�outstanding traits of the Utah pioneer women!

And will you pay your tribute to your mother, as I want to pay to mine, in the words that the prince paid to his: She of whom you speak, My mother, looks as pure as some serene creation minted in the golden moods Of sovereign artists; not a thought, a touch, But pure as lines of green that streaks the white Of the first snowdrop's inner leaves. (Tennyson)

God bless our mothers and our girls who hope to be mothers, that they may keep their bodies pure and unsullied, and merit from their sons the tribute we pay our mothers today, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

**KATHERINE FERNELIUS LARSEN - First Prize Poem: "The Cherry Orchard"**

She
Cherry Orchard

Katherine Fernelius Larsen

Out in the orchard, the sap is rising,
The cherry bark gleams mahogany-red.
The grass is showing new green by the tree roots,
And brown clods break from their thin snow bed.

I take my doll to the orchard swing,
And the sun-warmed air on my cheek breathes "Spring."
High and low, low and high,
Swing to earth, then swing to sky,
One with grass, then one with branches,
Doll and swing and I.

A world of enchantment, the orchard now;
The bridal branches, white as snow,
Lift lace-draped arms to the high, warm blue,
Drop idle petals to green below.
The orchard swoons while laden bees hover.
In the scent-sweet air, I await my lover.
Beat heart, beat; hum bees, hum;
Soon my love, my love, will come.
Stay the freighted moment, hold it
Close to the heart's wild drum!

The sun glows hot on crimson spheres,
Out the screen door my children spill.
"The cherries are ripe!" they shout, and pilfer
The plump and shining fruit, until
The red juice drips from greedy fingers,
And laughter spills from stained lips, and lingers...

Cherries ripe, cherries red,
Lush, inviting, overhead—
On rich fruit to satiation
Are my children fed.

Out in the orchard, silent and white,
The swing hangs empty, the limbs lift stark
Against a wintry sky, and rime
Of hoarfrost dulls the gleaming bark.
It is empty and still; yet branch and root
Hold memorized blossom, hold future fruit.

Katherine Fernelius Larsen, of Salt Lake City, is the wife of Rex F. Larsen and the mother of five young children. She is a member of the Art Barn Poets and Poets of the Pacific. Her poems have been published in The Improvement Era, The Relief Society Magazine, Wings, American Bard, The Salt Lake Tribune, and other publications. Last year she won second prize in the Annual Art Barn Poets Contest. A gifted student of literature, Mrs. Larsen plans to continue poetry composition and also to write fiction.

**ALICE MORREY BAILEY - Second Prize Poem: "Migrant"**

And No Defense

Look upon the universe.
The trees arise in passive might;
the daffodil, unwitting,
pours its gold from cup and frill;
the hollyhocks stand helpless
in the breeze and lean like whispering women,
while the bees traverse the petaled silk
and loot at will.

These live with sightless eyes and senses nil,
And no defense is theirs when north winds freeze.
Yet flowers know pulse and breath the same as I,
And spread their leaves with food beneath the sun;
Their seedlings grow mature and breed and die.
Some fold in hooded sleep when day is done.
What marks the difference, when both are sown
With life? Why, then, is conflict mine alone?

The Lives of These

Observe the cattle, hear the lonely loon;
The eagle soars where sky is thin and rare,
To plummet on his victim through the air;
The trout may swim his life in one lagoon.
The queen bee makes her nuptial flight at noon
And nevermore ascends its blazing stair.
The coyote finds his goal in prey and lair,
And sings his ghostly triumph to the moon.

The lives of these are bound and circumscribed
By laws unseen, immutable and fine.
Each threads a path of cycles pre-described,
While ultimate on ultimate is mine,
And I must ever yearn for heights too far,
Each star revealing yet another star.

Unbound

Have I not flown at will through star-hung space
In other worlds before this memory?
And tapped the source of light and energy,
And wrought my work unbound by time and place,
Untrapped by circumstance? Can I erase
Nostalgic pangs, when alien to me
Are clocks and cords and wheels?
Have I been free
To know unmeasured joy and perfect grace?

Why have the centuries behind my blood
Been restless in the labored ways of toil?
Why have they sought to rise from rocks and mud
To flight, or pioneered, or burned the precious oil
Of time for learning? Someday I shall go
Beyond the sea of death—and I shall know.

(For biographical sketch of Alice Morrey Bailey, see page 23.)

**RUBY BAIRD ANDERSEN - Third Prize Poem: "The Young War Widow Speaks"**

What good is a medal of oak leaves
On velvet in a case,
When the mind holds on to pictures
The heart cannot erase?

On the town's memorial plaque
When your only love has gone
And can never, oh, never come back?
On the back-yard bench the spring sun lies
Where he liked to sit making fishing flies.

No alchemy could work
In teeming word or sun,
If the heath is put a withered cone.

The plum hangs ripe on the green-leafed limb,
Just a little taller than the head of him.
Learn, I must, of many things,
And unlearn many more.
What is the shape of memory?
Is it twisted, pointed, and sharp?

Or large, star-shaped, and smooth like the dulcet tones of the harp?  
The sumac is red near the canyon's mouth,  
Three years since he went to camp in the South.  
Seasons can return again,  
New life that is spring's,  
Exultation that belongs to Maytime,  
And fruition that August brings;  
But blood and bone are passing,  
And muscle cannot last,  
Passion palpitates but once,  
Life's momentum soon is past.  
Memory often serves as bread,  
Or as a drink from which one sips,  
But memory cannot place a kiss  
Fresh upon the lips.  

The snowflakes slant around the corner light,  
There's a mound that's cold in a foreign night.  
Is it creeping centuries,  
Or only a thousand hours?  
That by this casement window I've climbed the night's blue towers  
To find this word, this answer:  
There's One who understands;  
I must lift my heart myself,  
With a pair of working hands.  

Ruby Baird Andersen, wife of Reuben Andersen of Provo, Utah, has two teen-age daughters and is a competent and charming homemaker. An active worker in the auxiliaries of the Church, she has served as a ward Relief Society president. As a member of the Provo Chapter of the League of Utah writers, Mrs. Andersen has been studying and writing poetry for several years. Her work has appeared in The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon), the Provo Daily Herald, The Relief Society Magazine, and other publications. Two of her poems were included in the anthology, Utah Sings, and one poem was published in Our Legacy, the Relief Society Centennial Anthology of Verse. On December 7, 1947, Ruby Baird Andersen passed away after a two weeks' illness. She had seen her picture and her poem in page proof the day before her death.  

THE Relief Society General Board is pleased to announce the names of the award winners in the short story contest which was announced in the June 1947 issue of the Magazine, and which closed September 15, 1947.

The first prize story of forty dollars is awarded to Alice Morey Bailey, 256 Iowa Street, Salt Lake City, Utah, for her story "Nugget of Truth."

The second prize of thirty dollars is awarded to Janath Russell Cameron, 237 "D" Street, Salt Lake City, Utah, for her story "The Answer."

The third prize of twenty dollars is awarded to Myrtle M. Dean, 435 East 2d South, Provo, Utah, for her story "Our Children's Children."

This story contest, first conducted by the Relief Society General Board in 1941 as a feature of the Relief Society centennial observance, was made an annual contest in 1943. The contest is open only to Latter-day Saint women who have not at least one literary composition published or accepted for publication by a periodical of recognized standing.

The three prize-winning stories are to be published consecutively in the first three issues of the Magazine for 1948.

Thirty-three manuscripts were submitted in the contest for 1947. Only one of the prize winners for this year had previously placed in the Annual Relief Society Short Story Contest.

This contest was initiated to encourage Latter-day Saint women to express themselves in the field of fiction. The General Board feels that the response to this opportunity will continue to increase the literary quality of The Relief Society Magazine, and will aid the women of the Church in the development of their gifts in creative writing.

Many of the stories submitted in the 1947 contest emphasized the moral theme to the detriment of the quality of the stories. It is suggested that the authors try to improve the literary craftsmanship of their submissions, giving the story plan and particular attention to character development, and giving careful attention to the fine details of word and sentence structure.

The Relief Society Magazine now has a circulation of more than 85,000. There are subscribers in every state of the Union, and in many foreign countries, thus providing a varied and interested group of readers. Writers, recognizing this large and appreciative audience, realize the importance of centering the contest on their very best work.

The General Board congratulates the prize-winning contestants, and expresses appreciation to all those who submitted stories. Sincere gratitude is extended to the three who, in their discernment and skill in selecting the prize-winning stories.

The General Board also acknowledges the valuable contribution of the short story committee in supervising the contest.

Alice Mortey Bailey

Her heels and looked at her small daughter, Penny, in dismay. It wasn't enough to have all this packing to do before the train would leave at six in the morning. On top of it, she must have this nagging worry about Penny.

"Just what did you tell the man at the door, Penny?" "I told him a great big elephant jumped out of the closet and ate you all up," said Penny, with a beatific smile. "Now can we pack my dolly dresses?"

"Penny, you didn't!" "Yes, I did, and I told him, besides, you haven't a minute to spare, and you look a sight!"

"Oh," moaned Anna Lea. "Whatever is Mommy going to do with you? And what is your Daddy going to think when we get to San Francisco, and he finds out you still tell fibs? You're a big girl now, more than four."

Bill wouldn't understand it, any more than she did, but there it was. Modern parents, Bill said, didn't let things like this go on. Wasn't there child psychology, or some way to get at the bottom of it and find out why Penny lied? Bill called it that. Lies.

And it was no use for Anna Lea to talk of an over-active imagination, because Bill had been brought up in a strict household. He thought he was being liberal not to take his razor stop to Penny, or to lock her in the closet. He was going to, he said, if Penny wasn't cured by the time they got to San Francisco.

"It's up to you, Dear. You're the one who is with her all the time. I can't do a thing when I'm traveling like this," he had said. Bill was very young looking, but his jaw was firm, and if the truth had it, that was the real reason why

NUGGET OF TRUTH

he had given up the job of troubleshooter on the Santa Fe and had taken a job in the office—so he could spank Penny and lock her in the closet.

Anna Lea didn't know very much about children, but even she knew there should be a better way. Bill didn't know how big and heavy his hand was, and when Bill got angry he shouted.

"Who was the man at the door, Darling? Did he say?"

"Oh yes! That was Mr. Jefferson, and he is one of Daddy's friends." The name didn't ring any bell in Anna Lea's memory. Bill was sweet. He had so many friends. He was big and ambitious and forthright.

It wasn't so much that she was afraid of Bill as it was that she was afraid he would stop loving her. "A man's choice of a wife can't be overestimated," he said once. He was reading about a friend's divorce in the paper. "You take Stubby, here. It says incompatibility in the paper, but it goes a lot deeper than that. Stubby was with me over there, and he thought he had the world wrapped up in a little blond cocoon, but what does he find when he gets home? The cocoon turns out to be a butterfly." "Bill, that's clever!" "These war marriages! A guy gets all steamed up and heroic, and everything looks like hot stuff to him. He grabs off a last-minute marriage before he goes out to fight, and when he gets home he finds he's tied for life to some little ball of fluff, if not to a grindstone." "Millstone, Bill," corrected Anna Lea, and added in a very small voice, "ours was a war marriage." "Right," said Bill, "and did I know you? You had me so dazzled I didn't know what went on in that little head of yours." He had stood up then, to come and kiss her. "And you still do," he said, his eyes growing warm, his lips circling her face with kisses. "But I mean to find out." And when he did, what would he know? Would he still love her? Would he think she had character? He had thought so the day he had given her her watch—the day Penny was born. "Honey," he had said, sitting beside the hospital bed after it was all over and she had rested, "I brought you something." He had been down to send the good news telegrams. "It's a good watch, the best there is. Just like your little heart, ticking away all the time you were bringing my baby. I'm so glad it didn't stop," he said, and his face crumpled, his voice too. There were tears on her hands when he snapped the watch on her wrist.

"K E K K & 'XX"

WHEN are we going to pack my dolly dresses?" Penny's voice jolted her back into reality. Doll clothes were spread all over the overstuffed chair, enough of them to fill the space needed for Anna Lea's fur coat. "Those old rags! Throw them away, Penny Dearest, and we'll get you some more when we get there." "I couldn't," said Penny. "This dress I bought at Moffats, and it costed millions of dollars. It's real velvet. And this one is silk, and it costed millions of dollars, too. Besides I made them all myself, and my dolls can talk to me when you are gone, and they told me while you were asleep that they just love their clothes." "Oh, Penny," said Anna Lea in despair. "Can't you tell the truth?" "This time I am," said Penny virtuously. "They are really silk and velvet, and I really did pay millions...." "Penny!" Penny's eyes filled with tears and she began to cry, her little lower lip trembling. Penny was still a baby, with a baby's contours curving into creases at her wrists and elbows, and at the base of her sweet little throat, where Bill said that kisses grew. "How about a kiss for Daddy?" he would say, and Penny would tip back her head. "Are there any kisses there?" "Dozens of them," Bill would declare. "Then you can have them," Penny would tell him, stopping her play dutifully, tangling his hair and laughing when he tickled her. Penny's dimpled features could go, as Bill said, from May flowers to April showers in a matter of split seconds, and just now they were all woe. Anna Lea couldn't hold out against the grief in the small face, and took Penny in her arms. "There, Baby!" she said, patting her. "Will you pack my dolly dresses?" Penny said, mollified and pressing quick advantage. "Yes, yes, Dear. Mother will," promised Anna Lea, a little taken aback, and with mental reservations. I just can't! She thought. So much to pack—so little space. I'll have to think of something. "Put them in your box and leave them. I'll have to see where they'll fit. Why don't you help Mother to remember all the things," she added, hoping to get Penny's mind off the doll clothes. It gave Anna Lea a headache to think of all the little, last minute details—services to be discontinued, a drayman for her trunks, and the countless friends who called, wanting to take her to lunch, to dinner, to a show on her last day here. She had run the gamut of excuses. "I'd love to, Darling, but I have a terrific headache," or an appointment with the dentist, anything that came quickly to mind. "We must remember our tooth brushes in the morning. We have to leave them out to use. Help me to remember to give the apartment key back to the manager, and to think of a good safe place to pack my jewelry...." He had put her jewelry in every piece of luggage she had, her watch, her costume jewelry, and the emerald pin and earrings Bill had given her, only to take them out again. She picked up her watch, laying its smooth crystal to her cheek, thinking of Bill. It was a warm link between them. "Mommy, let me wear your watch on the train," Penny asked. "Of course not, Honey. I can't even wear it myself, because the link is broken." Her watch fascinated Penny. She would miss it acutely. She sighed and put it back with the little heap of jewelry on the desk. There were little heaps everywhere, her stockings and underwear, Bill's dress clothes, and Penny's dolls. It was 20 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1948 NUGGET OF TRUTH too much, and now there was that man, Bill's friend to worry about. She should have answered the door, herself, but it would have been too awful to have him see her like this, in slacks and mules, her hair in a kerchief and her face smudged with dust. And all this litter! Penny's doll clothes added the finishing touch. Penny was industriously packing them into her box, her face a miniature of housewifely concern. If Bill could only see her now! She was so adorable, her baby lips pursed, her round little fingers making their vague movements. Who could spank a child like that? "Penny, would you like to play at Jamie's for half an hour?" Anna Lea asked after a little busy silence.

WHEN Penny had gone Anna Lea let herself out of the service entrance and into the elevator to the basement. She had a basket of things to be burned. Uppermost on it was the box of Penny's doll clothes, atrocious little things Penny had crudely fashioned from her own worn-out things, silk print and old velvet, badly cut, with raw edges and ridiculous stitching. She would really have to teach Penny to sew, now that she was old enough.

It was all trash, bits of crumpled lace, some artificial flowers matted with embroidery silk, and some stringy ribbons. Nevertheless, she had a guilty little pang as she put them into the fire, turning her face from the heat of the glowing coals. She watched the sides of the box darken with smoke and the edges begin to curl. There was an instant when she would have snatched them out, but they broke into flame, and it was too late. Millions of dollars, Penny had said. With a little constriction of her heart, Anna Lea shut the door on the burning doll clothes and went upstairs. She shut her eyes, but couldn't shut out the sight of the flame, browning the tiny sun-suit, licking the small blue coat. The telephone was ringing as she went back into the apartment, Western Union, calling with a telegram from Bill. Jefferson, the big boss, calling to see you en route East. Squelch Penny's imagination. Everything depends on good impression. Better job, more money. Jefferson stickler for truth. Poor Bill! He must have been fearful to have sent that. "Oh!" she said suddenly, "Mr. Jefferson!" The truth hit her like a landslide. That was Mr. Jefferson whom Penny had told an elephant had eaten her mother—the man at the door. This was too awful! Bill would never forgive her. What was worse, he would never forgive Penny. A stickler for truth, Bill had said. Anna Lea wished fervently she might dissolve in thin air. What should she do? Rectify the mistake, obviously, but how? Where did he stay? If she could call him and tell the absolute truth, invite him to dinner at her new home as soon as he returned to San Francisco, that might do it. Somehow she would fix things for Bill.

SHE began calling the hotels. "Is a Mr. Jefferson registered there?" she asked repeatedly. After half an hour at the telephone, searching his whereabouts, she gave up. Anger overwhelmed her. Anger at Bill. What did he think, that you could tear your goods out of your home—well, your apartment—and be serenely calm enough to receive visitors? Anger at Penny. Bill was not so far wrong with his razor strops and closets—even closets inhabited with the terrifying "elephants!" of Penny's imagination. Why couldn't the child have said what she was told to say, that her mother had a headache, that she was ill? Even that now seemed a flimsy excuse. Anna Lea had supposed it to be some kind of joke. It could be Simmons from across the hall.

She was angry even at the unsuspecting Mr. Jefferson. Why, at least, couldn't he have telephoned? She was sitting beside her open trunk, her fingers pressing her throbbing temples, trying to think what next to do, when Penny burst in.

"I told Jamie I couldn't play any more because I have the measles and a broken leg, and besides I have to pack up baby's clothes."

Penny stopped short, looking for the box. "Did you pack them, Mommy? Did you put them in a suitcase?" she asked apprehensively.

Anna Lea, conscious of the guilt of being busy, did not answer. Penny came and stood before her in small implacability.

"Did you put my doll clothes in a suitcase, Mommy?"

"Yes, yes," mumbled Anna Lea in a preoccupied manner, lifting her stocking box into the tilt of her trunk with great care.

"Which suitcase did you put them in?" Penny insisted.

Anna Lea waved a vague hand at the set of bags and boxes.

"Oh Lord!" Penny. One of those. I can't remember. We'll find out when we get to San Francisco," she evaded.

I'll get her some real velvet and satin and make her dolls beautiful clothes the minute we get there, she promised herself. Penny subsided in a chair, not satisfied, but thoughtful. Anna Lea hoped, with a little sigh of relief, that the uncomfortable matter was closed.

"It was a really good place to pack your jewelry," Penny commenced in adult-like conversationalism.

"My jewelry!" said Anna Lea, startled. "What do you mean?" The heap of jewelry was gone from the desk. "Penny, where is Mother's jewelry?"

"You said to help you find a good place, and I helped. I put it down in the middle of my baby clothes box. Wasn't I a good girl?"

"You mean it's bumped? My jewelry—my watch that Daddy gave me—burned in the trunk?" 

ANNA Lea stood stock-still, remembering the flame that licked at the side of the box, remembering the glowing bed of coals beneath, the finger pointing at her. She stared at her, her eyes round and accusing.

"You burned up my dolly dresses, Mommy," she stated. "You said you packed them."

Anna Lea had a sick feeling, seeing the child's stricken face, sensing her own loss. Penny had loved those doll clothes as much as she had loved her watch.

She opened her mouth, the urge for excuses, palliatives, promises, strong upon her, but the moment was too deep, too significant. On it turned her whole life, her entire shop with Penny—with Bill. "I told you a lie, Penny," she said, wrenching the words from their habitual sockets. "A big, very bad lie. I did say I packed them. I did burn your baby clothes."

Penny's sobs were heartbreak. "Lana's velvet dress—Billy Boy's blue coat—burned!"

No less burning was the vision of Bill's job, swept into the holocaust of Mr. Jefferson's disapproval, Bill's love for her, smoking in contempt, licked by the small flames of her own worth lies and deceits of convenience. She knelt beside Penny.

"I know how you feel, Penny. I've been a very bad mother. I know exactly how you feel!"

Penny stopped short, struck by an idea. "My own pack them, Mommy? Daddy's pack—"

"Don't cry, my pretty Mama," she wept on. "My dolly's clothes didn't cost millions and millions of dollars,
and I didn't buy them at Moffats. My dollies didn't tell me they loved them, because my dollies can't talk."

"Penny, you're telling the truth," marveled Anna Lea.

Penny's eyes smiled tears and her little mouth trembled.

"Of course! I thought it was a lovely good place to pack your jewelry," she said contritely.

"Oh, Baby!" And Anna Lea took Penny into her arms. The reason why Penny lied—the cure for it—lay like a nugget in the ashes of her loss.

The telephone rang, then, like a second chance. It was Mr. Jefferson.

"Just a moment," Anna Lea said cupping the mouthpiece. "It was a good place, Penny Darling. A very good place!"

Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, January 1, and January 15, 1888

FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ZION AND THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ALL NATIONS.� APOSTROPHE (To the liberated spirit of Zion's late Prophetess and Poetess Eliza R. Snow Smith)
Holiness, akin to beauty,
Stamped thee with a marvelous seal;
Powerful was thy sense of duty,
Irrepressible thy zeal;
Counselor, so true, so able;
Ready to relieve distress;
The afflicted and the tempted
'Twas thy ministry to bless.
Emily H., Emily Woodmansee

LETTER FROM OHIO:
I was told the other day by an acquaintance that my "Mormon friend, Eliza Snow, is dead," and he said that notices of her death were in all the Cincinnati papers. I did not see the notices, but I felt very much saddened to hear of it. One's life is made up of regrets, at least my life is. I shall always regret that I never had a fuller acquaintance with "Sister Eliza" as you all so lovingly call her. She was a noble, a wonderful woman, it seemed to me, and I shall now always think of her as being in heaven with the many who were "first at the sepulcher," and as always busy and happy.
I wonder what the future of the peculiar people will be. . . .
There is work in church and moral movements for women now. God grant that we may all do our work faithfully.
Emily Scott

THE OLD YEAR'S BLESSINGS
I am fading from you,
But one draweth near,
Called the angel guardian
Of the coming year;
I brought joy to brighten
Many happy days;
Let the New Year's angel
Turn them into praise.
Adelaide A. Proctor

EDITORIAL NOTE: Jack, the Fisherman, by Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, is a pathetic story of the net woven by the demon alcohol to entrap the unwary. The tale is told with a depth of pity and tenderness that should waken a responsive chord in the heart of every person to work for the rescue of precious souls from the horrors of intemperance.

Hundred years ago last November 7, Elizabeth Blackwell entered the only medical school that would accept a woman, to become, two years later, America's first woman doctor.

Contending against social ostracism and unfair professional treatment, she yet built a great career and accomplished untold good, relying on God for guidance. 'To honor her, the American Medical Women's Association is planning to build a library on the campus of the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania. On the bookplate to be used in the library is, center, a vignette of Arete, the "Light of Hellas" (ancient Greece), author of forty books on natural science and healing. Around the border of the bookplate are names of women famous in medicine, among them: Blackwell; Stevenson, _ first woman member and delegate to the American Medical Association, 1876; La Chapelle, famous French midwife; Erxleben, who practiced in Germany about 1750; Kahn, pioneer Chinese woman physician; Joshi, first medical woman in India; Mazzolini, early Italian medical woman inventor.

ONE of the largest funerals ever held in Franklin, Idaho, was that of Mrs. Eliza Doney Lowe, a sweet lady of eighty-four, who was active in Relief Society for more than fifty years and put its precepts into practice daily. Most of her waking hours, these later years, she spent helping those who needed comfort or assistance, whether they were rich or poor. She is survived by ninety-five great-grandchildren.

ANOTHER beloved Relief Society worker who died recently: in Salt Lake City, at the age 'of: ninety-eight, was Mrs. Juliana Petrea Thygesen Fredericksen, a native of Denmark.

EURIDICE TURANO, a lovely girl from Buenos Aires, Argentina, now enrolled at the Brigham Young University, Provo, is fulfilling a life-long dream to attend a university in the United States. A convert to the Church twelve years ago, she edited in Buenos Aires a magazine for missionaries and traveled throughout Argentina teaching the gospel.

LAST October 27, Mrs. Ann C. Milne of Salt Lake City reached the age of ninety-nine years. She still attends Relief Society and Daughters of Utah Pioneers meetings, and does housework. Fourteen years ago, an operation restored her eyesight after fifteen years of blindness. She has seventy-seven great-grandchildren.

"Warm Hearts and Friendly Hands"

Loyalty to the teachings of the gospel shown by one's daily conduct, loyalty to one's family, loyalty to friends and those placed in Church positions of authority, bring to a person the blessings of heaven. In the midst of trials and afflictions, how sweet, how solacing is the loyalty of friends. When the Prophet Joseph Smith was a prisoner in Liberty Jail, the Lord spoke these comforting words: "Thy friends do stand by thee, and they shall hail thee again with warm hearts and friendly hands. Thou art not yet as Job; thy friends do not contend against thee neither charge thee with transgression as they did Job (D&C 121:9-10)." It is a priceless gift to be able to rely on the loyalty of one's associates, to be certain that they will remain staunch and true in adversity. Every president of the Church has been surrounded by associates who would have been loyal to the death. That is an attribute of the Lord's apostles.

In any Church position to which a woman may be called, she owes full loyalty to those placed over her and to those with whom she labors. One of the reasons that the Relief Society is different from every other woman's organization on the face of the earth, is that the leaders are called by men bearing the Holy Priesthood, and seekers of positions are not called. When a woman is chosen for a position, she may expect the full loyalty of all the women with whom she works.

It is a sorrowful thing for a woman to be disloyal to those placed over her, or to be disloyal to those whom she professes to befriend. Those who would dwell in the presence of the Lord and belong to the Church of the Firstborn "see as they are seen, and know as they are known." A sincere woman shuns associating with women whom she knows, from past experience, are disloyal to friends and associates. She knows that each person will have to answer! For every idle word spoken. Said Jesus, "But I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment" (Matt. 12:30).

As a woman increases in years she should increase also in all righteousness. Her appearance, more and more, comes to mirror the spirit within. Sweetness and goodness tend to illumine and refine. At the beginning of this new year, each Relief Society member will earn the approbation of the Lord if she keeps a stricter curb on her tongue, builds up her sisters, and proves her loyalty to friends and principles through her daily living.

EARTH'S SONG OF THE ROAD

C. Cameron Johns

On me; the footsteps of mankind have traced
Now swift, now slow, the sum of history.
Unceasing, endless pageantry has paced.
Across the earth, and marked incisively
My charted ways. What wondrous traffickings
Through canyoned hills and over quilted field
Have been my lot! What strange and awesome things
The rich gold tapestry of earth will yield.

Men traverse age on age and mile on mile,
And to each era countless changes bring;
Today a beggar walks where just a while ago
Upon my breast, there walked a King.

Miss Libby Steps Out

Olive W. Burt

Miss Libby Gray, hurrying home with her groceries, had little reason to look about her. It was terrifically hot that midsummer day, and Miss Libby's one desire was to get back to her little cottage, to the shaded coolness of her vine-covered porch. But, as she rounded the corner of Twelfth Street, the billboard across the way struck through her preoccupation, and she stopped and stood there, the sun beating down on her funny little straw hat, as she gaped at the sign.

The circus!

Time again. Miss Libby forgot the heat and the dust as she stared at the gay posters with their galloping horses, lovely women, and heroic men. At last she sighed, and moved on more slowly down the street. She had never seen a circus—never in all her long, drab years. She hadn't even wanted to see one—hadn't even thought about circuses—for a long, long time.

She could remember though, how much they had meant to her at one time. She could remember that summer morning when she was ten. Everyone in the village, it seemed to her, was going to the circus. Teddy James had asked her, "You going to the circus, Libby?" And when she told him that her father wouldn't let her go, Teddy had nodded wisely: "Sure, it's circus mine won't either—that is, he won't give me the money to go. But me and the other fellows are going to carry water for the elephants. Man said he would give us free tickets."

"Oh, Teddy!" Libby had begged, "let me help! Let me carry water, too!"

But it was a boy's job, and there were more boys wanting it than could have it. There was no place for her—a girl. She had stayed home that afternoon, sitting on the side porch, shelling peas, and hearing through the clear, blue summer air the sharp, sweet music of the calliope.

"Papa was just plain stingy!" she said now, and was startled that she had given voice to the hitherto unacknowledged conviction. She felt a little ashamed, too, remembering that this very stinginess was the only thing that had made it possible for her to live as she had all these years, without having to work too hard or worry too much.

She went into her big, cool kitchen and laid her groceries on the table. As she went to put her change into the grocery money can, she gave a little start of surprise.

"Hmmm!" she said, talking half aloud to herself as was her habit, because she was always alone and had no one else to talk to, "I've sure been economical this month. There's more'n two dollars still left in the can."

Two dollars! Papa would have gone straight to the bank with it.

But then, Papa had had to skimp and save for her sake. "But I don't!" she said savagely.

"MISS LIBBY STEPS OUT"

"I haven't a chick nor a child to pass my stuff on to." She stood there, staring at the two dollars, feeling terribly alone. Then, scarcely realizing that she had made a decision, she hurried into her little bedroom and changed her clothes. Glancing furtively over her shoulder as if afraid that Papa might be watching her, she took the change from the grocery money can. "It'll mean I can't have a little roast Sunday," she muttered, but would not let her lips go on to say that this meant no cold meat on Monday and no hash on Tuesday. She shrugged. "Eat too much meat, anyway!" she said.

HE bus to the circus grounds was crowded, but Miss Libby didn't care. She even liked it. She liked standing among the men and women and the jabbering, excited children. Her cheeks felt warm, and she knew her hat was askew, but she kept smiling at everyone and imagined everyone smiled at her.

Once at the circus grounds, she walked slowly, scuffling her feet to stir up little clouds of dust, wanting to feel and hear all the beauty and romance of the place. She bought some pink lemonade and some pink popcorn, and was just going to purchase a ticket to the fat lady side show when caution stopped her.

"Better get my ticket to the Big Top first," she said, her tongue loving the feel of the phrase, "don't know how much it'll cost. Used to be twenty-five cents, but I've grown up since then." Reaching up to get her ticket from the uniformed man, who stood in one end of the red and gold van, was an adventure in itself. The ticket cost $1.50, so Miss Libby couldn't see any side shows. She shrugged. It didn't matter, anyway. The signs and barkers were just as good, maybe even better, than inside.

Up and down the midway she roamed, letting her feet splash in the hot dust, letting her ears drink in the exciting disharmony of raucous-voiced barkers, chattering children, scolding parents, and trumpeting animals. But, at last, she went into the big tent, handed over her ticket, and with the high excitement of a love tryst, entered the dusty, noisy semidarkness.

The animals were even better than Miss Libby had ever imagined. She moved from cage to cage, past the lions pacing sedately to and fro, tossing their manes at each turn; past the tigers and jaguars, beautiful in their lithe grace. She stopped at the monkey cages, laughing aloud with the children beside her. She marvelled at the zebras and llamas, the camels and giraffes, just like their pictures. She watched little boys drop peanuts in the straw for the elephants to find with their long, sensitive trunks.

At last she sighed, gave a last look over the noisy, smelly oval, and went through the flap into the Big Top itself.

"Get reserved seats!" the barker called, and Miss Libby's lips lifted scornfully. Any seat would be a reserved seat to her. She was going to take her time, though, and find the best place. She walked slowly, measuring the advantages of sitting near the reserved seats against those of being at the very end; of sitting in the first row with climbing to the top, where she could, perhaps, see more.

At last she found her place, not too far from the doorway, so she could see the grand entrances, and on the first row. "Tl feel closer to 'em here," she told herself, wriggling her slight figure in among the scuffling little boys. It was wonderful!

From the moment the band began to play and the grand spectacle passed dazzlingly around the big arena, Miss Libby found her two eyes—her five senses—were not enough. She watched the aerialists, the seals and lions and elephants, the bareback riders, the clowns. Particularly, the clowns.

For some reason, it seemed to Miss Libby that here, in the fanciful garb of these crazy tumblers, was the very spirit of the circus—the very heart of the great mystery that had called so urgently to her heart so many, many years ago. The clowns came around the sawdust circle in front of the seats— the giants and the dwarfs, the red-headed clowns and the blackfaced clowns, clowns with ridiculously big feet, and clowns with four feet, and clowns with no feet at all—tumbling, pulling faces, poking at the squealing children on the front row, taking the audience into the fun—into the glory that was the circus.

Miss Libby watched, fascinated. She found herself giggling like the children around her, squealing, too, as a clown let loose a rubber mouse or fell from a kicking burro. Then, right in front of her, a little clown in a red-and-yellow suit began tumbling about, performing unbelievable antics—breaking himself in two, falling together again, while the children clapped, and Miss Libby rose from her seat in her excitement.

At last, the little clown drew himself upright, all in one piece, after all, and bowed sedately. Miss Libby was laughing as she could not remember ever having laughed before, laughing like a little girl, and clapping her hands. The little clown looked straight into Miss Libby's eyes. His own eyes were blue and merry, but as they looked into Miss Libby's brown ones, they grew suddenly serious in his grotesque, painted face. It seemed to Miss Libby that the clown's eyes were speaking to her, were saying something she couldn't quite catch, though her heart stood still for a moment, listening.

Then he bowed again and went running and tumbling out of the tent. The rest of the show seemed a little less exciting now. Miss Libby kept turning from the dazzling aerialists and the performing lions to search among the clowns for that one funny little figure. He didn't come in again, and Miss Libby wondered what he could be doing. Maybe he has other jobs to do, she thought, sadly, and him the best clown they have. It's a shame!

WHEN the circus was over, Miss Libby was pushed out of the tent by the surging crowd around her—out into a sunlight grown drab and a day that held no mystery. She couldn't bear the thought of going home. She walked about among the tents, watching the crowd thin until there were only a few loiterers like herself scattered about. She saw, at one side of the big field, a long tent, and smelled the odors of cooking that came from it. Stiffening her backbone and giving her timidity a mental shaking, she walked toward it.

Her courage fading, the wrong figure came toward the cook-tent. Miss Libby recognized him at once—not from his face, which was no longer grotesque, but was friendly and human; not from his clothes, which were ordinary gray slacks and shirt, but from the quick, precise movements and the blue, merry eyes.
Miss Libby stared. That's how a clown looks in real life! she thought, and she envied him the paint and clothes that were his transport into wonderland.
"Oh, Mister!" she cried, before she knew it.
The little man stopped, looked at her sharply, and nodded.
"Good evening, ma'am," he answered.
Miss Libby's words came straight from her heart, not waiting to be censored by her mind or her sense of propriety.
"Oh, Mr. Clown, I thought you were the best thing in the whole circus! I never saw anything like you. Would you�" Now
she began to stumble. "Would you read this? I've read about�"
The little man came close to her. He was smiling and his eyes looked happy.
"Yeah," he said, "I saw you there—in the front row, you were, weren't you? Not many ladies sit there—mostly kids. So you liked my act, eh?"
"Oh, yes!" she breathed. "It was marvelous. I—I waited here hoping I would see you so I could tell you�"
"That's mighty nice of you, ma'am," the man said, and there was all of the circus in his voice. "Mighty nice! Not many people do that any more."
Miss Libby was fumbling in her bag. She brought out a little card and a stub of a pencil.
"Would you," she began, and then went on apologetically, "I've never had anyone's autograph—I never wanted one before—but if you only would—I could sort of look at it and remember�"
She was holding out the little white square with an unconsciously pleading gesture.
The little man surely beamed at her unbelievably. Then his eyes grew suddenly bright, and his voice shook a little as he asked, "You mean—do I mean you want my autograph? Say, lady—" The little circus man took the card from her. He stood staring at it for a moment, and then asked gently, "What is your name, Lady?"
Miss Libby told him, and he lifted his pencil. He cried, "I never saw anyone like you. Would you—" Now the unbelievable sight—of a little gray-clad figure standing firmly on one leg, writing upon an uplifted knee. It was better than the circus, itself. When he had finished, he handed her the card, with a deep bow.
"There you are, Madame," he said, and Miss Libby felt herself grow tall and lovely. "And thank you. You have made me very happy." Made you happy?" she whispered, and stared after him as he went into the tent. Then she looked at the card, holding it close to her eyes to read in the fading afternoon light: To Miss Libby Gray—the greatest little lady that ever watched me perform, with deep appreciation for her kind heart. Roy, the Clown.
Miss Libby went home, now. Her day was over. She put the card in the corner of her dresser looking glass, and long after she had stretched out in bed, the little square twinkled and smiled at her, and the memory of happiness was sweet around her.

A NEW YEAR
Clarence Edwin Flynn

Isn't it good to put by the fears
And cares and worries of all the years;
To take the debits of sorrows known,
The strifes and wrongs of the days agone,
The unkind words and the unkind looks
Together, and charge them off the books?

Isn't it good to have a day
To put the wrongs and mistakes away,
The disappointments and failures,
Too, and let the thought of them all be through,
To close the page on the hurt and strife,
And open a new account with life?

RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1948
A Decade of Doing
Dorothy Ducas [Issued by The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis]

Infantile Paralysis, supported by the now-familiar March of Dimes each January, will be ten years old on January 3, 1948. Ten years, in history, is but a moment. To mothers and fathers it is half their children's lives as children.

What has happened to speed the fight against infantile paralysis in the decade is of immediate interest and concern to all parents...

Let's list a few of the things it has done in its ten-year span:

First, it has become an organization with 2,735 local branches called chapters, manned by local volunteers, friends and neighbors of all of us. These local branches are the focal points for families in which infantile paralysis occurs, for from them comes financial assistance for the medical care of patients whose families cannot afford the complete costs without aid.

In the period between May, 19309, when the first chapter was formed, and December 31, 1947, chapters have given direct assistance to an estimated 88,000 patients, according to reports from National Foundation representatives in all the states. In some instances, this assistance meant payment of all medical charges: hospital, medical, nursing, physical therapy, transportation to and from hospitals and clinics.

In others, it meant the provision of a wheelchair, of braces, or perhaps a pair of crutches.
This service has been available to everyone in need of help, National Foundation for regardless of age, race, creed or color...

Second, the chapters of the National Foundation have provided funds for staffing and equipping polio units in local hospitals in many places, so that medical care would be available if polio came. In 1938, there were some 300 hospitals that admitted polio patients in the acute stage of the disease, according to the best available estimates. Today, there are at least 717 polio units in the country accepting acute cases...

The importance of the growth of treatment centers is underlined by medical authorities. They agree that early diagnosis and hospitalization can do more to prevent deformity and minimize crippling than any other one procedure now known...

FOLIO treatment has been changing in the last ten years. There is more stress today on early physical therapy. Here was one field where qualified workers were so scarce that money itself could not buy enough or efficient enough services for polio patients—without helping to create new physical therapists. The National Foundation in 1945 set aside $1,267,600 to train physical therapists at approved schools and to create new teachers for these schools. As a result, 893 physical therapy scholarships had been granted up to October 1, 1947, increasing the supply of these workers by about twenty-five per cent.

Adequate polio treatment is an expensive item beyond the reach of
the average budget. It is estimated each patient hospitalized for a year costs $2,000, while iron lung cases can cost as much as $20,000. Because of this, chapter treasuries frequently run dry under the pressure of a major outbreak.

When this happens, money is transferred from national headquarters to supplement chapter funds, which consist of fifty per cent of all March of Dimes receipts in the county. A total of $9,415,900 has been transferred to date to supplement chapter funds for patient care, $6,200,521 of it during the twelve months ending May 31, 1947, when 1,187 advances were made to 677 chapters. A group of women volunteers, specially trained to assist nurses and physical therapists in bedside care of polio patients in hospitals and homes, has been formed during the last three years. The Polio Emergency Volunteers, or PEVs, as they are called, have made it possible to spread the services of professional workers by relieving them of routine tasks so they have more time for skilled services. There are now about 9,000 PEVs throughout the county...

These steps forward in the field of patient care have been matched by achievements in scientific research and professional education. Since the National Foundation made its first research grant only a little more than six months after it RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�JANUARY 1948 was formed, the most intensive and comprehensive attack ever made on a single disease has been set in motion. Dozens of the country's leading scientists today are directing the search for knowledge and the training of professional workers at fifty of the most famous universities and medical schools in the United States. All told, 540 projects at 83 institutions in 29 states have been financed in ten years...

All these things have taken place within ten years. The final goal has not been reached, but knowing what has been done to relieve discomfort and pain, to prevent deformity, to minimize crippling, and to give every polio patient a fighting chance for the best possible recovery is a heart-warming thing to parents. It is comforting, too, to know that widespread and capable efforts are being made and continuously pursued to find a final solution to infantile paralysis. Because the National Foundation has done these things in its brief decade of doing, the appeal for continued support during the March of Dimes, January 15th to 30th, 1948, falls on responsive hearts. Men and women everywhere, and especially civic leaders and club women to whom this cause is of special interest, are urged to participate in the 1948 March of Dimes—to the end that the work of the last ten years may continue to ultimate victory.

How to Cover an Umbrella Bertha Zaugg Perschon

Through accidents or by long wear, umbrellas become shabby or useless. At the present time it is very expensive to buy a good umbrella that is both attractive looking and will wear well. The homemaker who understands how to cut patterns, and who is familiar with simple sewing, can cover her old umbrella frame for a fraction of the cost of buying a new umbrella. It is, however, necessary to proceed slowly and follow the directions with great care.

Materials Needed
1 yard of 39-inch material of your favorite color and texture. Rayon taffeta proves very satisfactory, as it does not split as readily as silk.
Glue for replacing the cap. If cap is lost, a plastic thimble makes a good substitute.
2 spools of thread, one for heavy duty hand sewing, and one for machine use.

Preparatory Steps
Soak the cap off the old umbrella by placing it in very hot water to melt the glue. Remove the cap.
Carefully remove the old cover—from the umbrella frame, taking particular notice of where, how, and why it is sewed. This is very important, for, in stitching back the new cover to the frame, the same type of stitches must be used in the same places in order to assure a perfect fit.

After carefully removing the old cover, all in one piece, unpick one of the panels, being sure not to tear or stretch it. Press this panel smooth and straight.

Waterproofing the Material
Place the material to be used as the new cover between two sheets of waxed paper and press with iron on low heat, the temperature for artificial silk or rayon. The applied heat causes the wax to permeate the material, thus making it waterproof. Use new pieces of waxed paper for each area of the material, carefully arranging the sheets so that no spaces of the material will be left without a wax coating.

Cutting the Pattern
Lay the pressed panel on a piece of paper and cut a pattern the same size and shape as the original panel, except for one slight difference. You will find that the wide end of the original panel will be slightly curved. Do not cut the curve, but make the pattern straight on this edge. The pattern should be even on both sides when folded on center lengthwise line. Make sure that the pattern is the exact size of the original panel, except for the curve.

Lay the yard of 39-inch material flat on the table and cut it in half lengthwise. Remove the selvages and make a 1/2-inch hem on both sides of the lengths of the two pieces. (See Diagram A.)

Place the pattern at the top of one of the two pieces of hemmed material; with the wide panel end at the right-hand hemline and the point of the triangular-shaped panel toward left-hand hemline. Be sure that the pattern is laid along the straight of the goods. (See Diagram B, in which Page 37 38 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�JANUARY 1948 DIAGRAM A CUT IN HALF HERE 1/4 INCH HEM 39 INCHES WIDE DIAGRAM C "FIRST STITCHING" ~~ SECOND STITCHING (VERY CLOSE TOGETHER) the straight of the goods is represented by dotted lines.)

Cut with pinking shears, beginning at the wide end of the panel and cutting toward the point. Alternate the pattern to the other hemline, and repeat until you have cut out one half of the number of panels needed to completely cover the umbrella. Then repeat the same process with the other half of the material.

Sewing the Panels
Lay two of the panels together and baste or pin the seam, beginning DIAGRAM B == a= 1/4 INCH HEM DIAGRAM D DIAGRAM E TOP JOINED SEAM TWO CIRCLES THREE INCHES 'N DIAMETER STITCHES 1/2 INCH FROM THE EDGE FOR MAKING RUFFLES i OF SECOND CIRCLE

Sina ne sew from the outside in. Continue adding the panels until all are joined. Then complete the circle by joining the last panel to the first. Fold each seam from right to left and top stitch on the wrong side only, just missing the first sewing. This strengthens the seams and prevents breaking of the stitches. (See Diagram C.)

When all of the panels are sewed together, the opening at the top should measure 1/2 inch in diameter.

Do not press at any time except when waterproofing.
Fastening the Cover to the Frame
Cut two circles of material, each three inches in diameter, and cut a 1/4-inch hole in the center of each. (See Diagram D.) Place one of these circles on the top of the umbrella frame.
Place the cover on the frame over the top of the small circle. Pin the corners of the cover to the frame by turning back onto the wrong side the corners of the joined panels 1/4 inch and placing a sharp pin through the folded material and the holes in the top of the frame. This holds the cover in place. Continue until all the panels are pinned. Then hand stitch the points of the panels to the tips of the umbrella spokes, in the same manner as the old cover was attached to the frame. (See Diagram E.)
Run a strong double thread around the top of the cover 1/4 inch from the edge and fasten to the top spoke, hand drawing in any slight fullness which may still be in the heavy fabric around the top of the frame toward the center.
Stitch the underside of the cover to the frame where and how it was stitched before. These stitchings vary with the style and shape of the umbrella.
Take the second stitch circle which you have already cut out (Diagram D) and make a row of running stitches around the outside, 1/4 inch from the edge, and draw the circle up until it is only 1/2 inch in diameter, forming a double ruffle. Place this over the cover on the tip of the frame and fasten securely.
Completing the Process
Furl the umbrella tip, or the substitute frame, being sure to get all the raw edges under the tip. Leave the umbrella closed until the glue dries, about twenty-four hours.
Make the braid for holding the spokes together from a scrap of the material, the same size as the old one, using it as a pattern for turning, or, if they are lost, use a snap fastener or their place. Sew the band to one of the spokes on the outside and sew the snap to the band.
When all the steps of the process are completed and the glue in the cap is thoroughly dry, open the umbrella and spray it with a fine spray of cold water from the hose or from the shower. This will shrink any slight fullness which may still be in the cover. Leave the umbrella open while it is drying.

How to Clean an Umbrella
An umbrella may be washed in cold, mild soapsuds. Use a soft brush to remove any spots. Rinse well with cold water. Leave the umbrella open until it is dry.
Three-Part Story to Begin in February
THE first installment of a three-part story "Windy Hilltop" by Ezra J. Poulsen, will begin in the February issue of The Relief Society Magazine. In this story of courage and conflict, the characters are vividly presented in their reaction to a problem of divergent loyalties. The dramatic situations are portrayed against the colorful background of western ranch life.
Mr. Poulsen, a native of Idaho, now residing in Salt Lake City, is well known as a contributor to both local and national publications. He is the author of two collections of verse, Songs for the Toilers and Poems in Varied Keys, and has compiled two anthologies of verse for publication. Readers of The Relief Society Magazine will remember with pleasure the poems and prose which Mr. Poulsen has contributed over a period of many years. His three-part story "The Rock and the River" appeared in the Magazine in 1944.

SYMPHONY
Beatrice Rordame Parsons
Spring was the overture—a moment's pain Of bursting bud, of storm, and rain, The lilting melody of trees and birds, Black earth to hum unvoiced words.
With summer's gay and glorious sun, With heat to warm, and crops to run, The fugue grows deep, the rhythms light, For winds to whisper through the night.
In winter all the notes are low, From muted violins they flow; The tempo seems about to die, When frost begins, and harsh gales cry.
It's but the coda to a lovely strain— Life's symphony will rise again; The Maestro still his baton keeps, This is the pause, the music sleeps.

Where Trails Run Out
CHAPTER 12—CONCLUSION
Anna Prince Redd
T was August 1884. Twilight fell and deepened the already sultry night.
"It is too hot to last!" Elizabeth exclaimed. "There will be a bad storm somewhere tonight, though I doubt if it will be here."
The darkness that had fallen over the landscape was more than just a natural withdrawal of light. Elizabeth felt lonely and afraid, not of exactly, or see. And most of all, she was afraid of her thoughts. Afraid of the years ahead.
The air was unusually fragrant with ripening fruit, yet oppressive and ominously heavy. She looked at the sky. Not a star showed through the heavy clouds that were rolling up like billows.
"What a night for Indian devilment," she said to herself. "I'm glad the children are all asleep and that Henry will soon be home."
She was fascinated by the elemental fury that seemed to be held 'n check only because there was no reason for unleashing it. She heard the long, hollow cry that preceded the rumble of distant thunder, she showed no surprise. Rather, there was a profound interest.
The cry was cavernous in its intensity, yet seemed to come from a long way off. It was the same weird warning that had come at Lost Spring, announcing the coming of the famished water scouts. The same mysterious, half-human, half-animal cry that she had waited so long to hear.
Henry came running from the river.
"Bejay, are you there?" he cried. "Betby!"
"What has happened, Henry?" Elizabeth asked, dazed by his sudden appearance, brought to reality by the excitement in his voice.
"I don't know, Bethy! But listen!" The long, hollow cry was repeated. Elizabeth, listening to it, sensitive to its faint inflection, was shocked at the agitated warning it carried.
"Someone is running steadily in the darkness!" Henry whispered.
"Yes. The lamps are lighted at Jamar's store. Whoever it is is running in that direction!"
"I can't see anything," Henry confided. "If there is trouble James will need me. Betby, you go inside and bolt the door."
"I'm not afraid, Henry. Do you remember hearing that strange cry ever before?"
Henry stopped, just as he had turned to go to James' assistance. "Yes. Yes!" he cried, growing more excited. "It's the same cry we heard at Lost Spring!"
"It's a warning, Henry. I don't like it. It may not have anything to do with this impending storm, or earthquake, or whatever it is that is shaping around us. It is a terrible cry—but remember we must not be powerless against it!"

The Indians are being badly treated by scheming white men and traders in wool and sheep, and by unwise cowboys, to say nothing of the bungling of the soldiers. There'll be trouble at the store, I'm sure. They seem to congregate there, Indians as well as whites."

"James and his family have nothing to fear from the Indians, Henry. And I feel safer out of the fort than I did when we were in it. Fair treatment is essential to peace, in this mission. And the Indians have had it from all of us, here at Montezuma. Go quickly to the store, Henry, if it will make you feel better. But come back as soon as you can."

Elizabeth went inside and bolted the door. She listened till she could not hear Henry's footsteps, and then she threw herself, face down, across her bed. All the bitter homesickness of the years welled up to choke her. Neither she nor Mary had known an hour of complete contentment since they had come to San Juan. The river bed had proved to be no place to build homes, and the farther back they would build, the more. Ravenous the "Devil Ditch" had become.

One day the river would be flowing peacefully toward the Colorado, the next it would have bitten out a chunk of beautiful farm land, green with grain, and be going in another direction. Not satisfied with its daily gorging, periodically it would rise and devour everything in its path, leaving islands of quicksand to ensnare more prey.

"We'll never be safe," Elizabeth wailed, as she thought of the river's ravages. "Never!"

HENRY came back. He gave the door a sharp rap, followed by a light one—a signal that it was he. Elizabeth opened the door.

"What time is it?" she asked, as if she had forgotten why he had been away.

"It's midnight," Henry answered. "The Indians are gathering at Mitchell's ranch. I think we had better move back to the fort."

"And I think that we'd better stay right here!" Elizabeth replied emphatically.

"Henry, I feel uneasy about the flood. Can you tell if it has been raining, up country?"

"It doesn't look like it," Henry answered. "But you never can tell." He looked at the black canopy overhead. "We could have a deluge here, though. I never saw things so black!"

He waited, then went on, "I don't like the sultry heaviness in the air."

"Come inside, Henry!" Elizabeth warned, drawing him within.

"There is another stealthy prowler!" Henry whispered, "Could you see anything?"

"No. It's nerve-wracking." A quick rap at the door startled them. Elizabeth caught Henry's hand in the darkness. Neither spoke. There was a listening pause, and the knock was repeated. Henry reached for his gun.

"Make a light," he ordered, "and stand back!"

Elizabeth complied. The door swung open, creaking on its dry, leather hinges, concealing Elizabeth as she followed its arc.

"How!" The low guttural was impatient and sharp. "White man wait too long. Me knock. Most times no see!"

42 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1948

Elizabeth came from behind the door.

"Se Kish!" she cried. "My friend!"

Henry looked from the majestic Indian to Elizabeth. "Friend!"

The Indian began talking directly to Henry.

"White man take squaw and papooses to high land. River he come. Maybe so daylight. No house here! No house there!"

His arms described his words. "Homes all go. No fence. No land!"

Henry shook his head in disbelief.

"I believe him, Henry!" Elizabeth cried. "Let me talk to him."

She pushed Henry aside and went closer to the Indian.

"You Jim Joe?" she asked.

The Indian drew back, surprised.

"How you know?" he questioned.

"White Mary told me. Jim Joe, does White Mary know about the flood?"

"White Mary will be safe from river. One more house. Missionary Haskell, he safe, too."

"When will river take house?" Elizabeth asked, conviction growing with her excitement.

"Maybe so nine, maybe so ten," the Indian answered. He gave Henry a slight, but imperative shove.

"White man stand too long. Talk too much!"

"Ya tah!" he said to Elizabeth, and was gone.

The blackness enveloped him, even against the candle-light and the open door.

Elizabeth pushed the heavy door shut.

"The river! I hate it!" She covered her face with her shaking hands.

"I don't know what to think," Henry said. "It's hard to believe that there will be a flood, when there isn't, or hasn't been a drop of rain."

"Just the same, Henry Harriman, the flood will come. And when it does, Henry we'll not have a chance."

ELIZABETH looked around at her pioneer home, grown suddenly very important, very dear. There were all her cooking pans and kettles, hanging above the chimney; her cupboard, with its pretty dishes brought from home; her braided rugs, her Indian blankets, soft and lovely in the candlelit room.

She went to the bedroom and, holding her hand around the candle flame so it would not shine in the children's faces, she looked at the wooden bedsteads, the handmade chest, the bright rag carpet on the floor.

"This is all we have," she told Henry, who had followed her. "And the 'Devil Ditch' will get it, just as it has taken everything else!"

"Elizabeth, I'm not taking any strange Indian's word on a thing like this. It's a trick. I don't believe him."

"The dawn is coming soon, Henry," Elizabeth reminded him. "I'll wake the children. You get the wagon ready."

The finality in her voice was too convincing to argue against, and Henry went to get the wagon.

Elizabeth put all the food they had into sacks and cans, boxes, and buckets, remembering how little they had had during those first hard months, remembering the little grave on the hillside.

"That is one thing the river won't take," she spoke softly. "Little brown-eyed lamb of a child!"

She folded the rugs, the bedding that was not in use, and, last of all, put their few clothes on top of the stack, ready for loading.

"We'll have no room for furniture," she said, watching Henry as his eyes went lingeringly from piece to piece of the things his hands had made. He shook his head in perplexity.

"What will the neighbors say?" he asked Elizabeth. "This is a silly thing to do."

"Start loading, Henry," was all Elizabeth could say.

She placed a crocheted doily exactly in the center of the hewn-log table and put a vase of wild flowers exactly in the center of the doily. She stood back and surveyed the entire poorly furnished room.

"I never thought it was pretty before," she confessed, and wiped the mist from her eyes.

"It's time to wake the children, Henry."

Henry looked at her pityingly. Whether this was a foolish thing to do or not, it was breaking Elizabeth's heart. He took an armload of the things and put them in the wagon.

HIGHER and higher the "Devil Ditch" rose.

Old banks caved into the boiling, half-mile wide river, to be followed in turn by the new banks. The floors of houses floated like rafts on the gray, tossing waters of the river. On one of these was a rocking chair, swinging madly back and forth, its cushions gay and dry, for the house had been lifted, land and all, and carried away. Chunk by chunk, the earth had loosened and tumbled into the swirling water, leaving the floor to float downstream. The roof and wall logs had one by one toppled off in the bad bouncing of the floor, till only the rocking chair remained. Houses, furniture, haystacks, wagons—everything that goes to make a home—careened by, jamming the river with debris. The Montezuma water wheel went out. The dam buckled and shivered. It held the wall of water for one defiant second, and then loosened and tossed the floating water wheel into the air, received it as it fell, and then flattened out, just another broken mass of trees and rocks and logs. Hens squawked in floating chicken coops; dogs and cats tried to climb to the tops of the houses, screeching in terror. From vantage points of safety, the hapless settlers watched their last remaining possessions go by. For thirty miles up the river where the cloudburst had started, not a house was left standing. At Montezuma, only two houses remained, those of James Davis and Thales Haskell.

WHERE TRAILS RUN OUT

There was a half hour of tense excitement when it was discovered that the Allen family was not among the rescued ones who starkly watched the ravage of their lands. "Sister Allen is missing!" Ted Davis cried. "I saw her son Bob up at the fort, trying to pacify the Indians." "And Brother Allen is in Fruitland, New Mexico!" James Davis exclaimed. "The family will be surrounded! Get help, Ted, and follow me!" "There's no time to lose, Pa!" Ted cried. "I'd better come with you!" "That may be so," James agreed, jumping on his horse, and riding at top speed toward the Allen ranch. Ted followed him, keeping his eyes open for any men who might be able to go along to help, but he saw no one who was not already fully occupied with his own problems.

"Thank goodness their house is on a small mound," James shouted, as they raced along. "Yes, but there's a swale on three sides of it!" Ted reminded his father. "It will be completely flooded." And it was. The little house, up to the window sills in water, looked forlorn and dejected. Two of the girls, Annie and Lizzie, were floundering in water up to their arm-pits, trying to rescue their chickens and a pig. "Mother's inside," Annie shouted. "The water is covering everything!" James and Ted swung from their saddles and opened the door. There stood Mrs. Allen, holding her two young children out of the water. She had put the chairs on the bed and the children on the chairs. She was thoroughly frightened, alone and helpless.

"Oh, Brother Davis," she cried, "I'm thankful that you have come! How are we going to keep from drowning?" "We'll get you out somehow, Aunt Jane," Ted Davis assured her. "But I don't know how!" The water was rising rapidly. The chairs on top of the bed were almost covered.

"We've got to get out of the house," James said. "But where to go is the next thing. We can't all six of us ride our two horses out, and there's not time enough to make two trips!"

"I know, Pa!" Ted cried. He had been looking around for something that would solve the problem for them. "There's the molasses boiler. We could use it as a boat!"

James turned in time to see Brother Allen leaping from his saddle and sinking into the river. Mary Davis watched block after block of their land sink into the river.

The Montezuma settlers never set foot on their land again. Honorably released from their mission, the saints were given a blessing and told to seek homes elsewhere. Driving out of the valley with the little they could salvage from the wreck of their homes, they filed out of San Juan. Poorer by five years than they were when they entered it. Richer by five years, in a job well done. A mission filled to the last measure.

One permanent town, Bluff City, had been established. And, from the families that sought homes in Southwestern Colorado, other thriving, small towns sprang up. The Indians became friends.

"I have often prayed for us to be delivered from you, old 'Devil Ditch,' " Mary Davis said. "It was you, by your very cussedness, that answered that prayer!"

Elizabeth stood up in her wagon seat as long as she could see her baby's grave. "Not all of me is leaving San Juan," she sighed. "At night when the stars are shining like tinsel, I'll come back in thought, Baby. And, wherever I go, the wind in the treetops will sigh your name to me. Goodbye... Goodbye..."

The fragrance of rain-washed sage.

Three Mexican Dishes
Sara Mills

Of all Mexican cooking is hot.
A person could live out his life in Mexico and not eat a single hot dish. The hot dishes are there, products of old Spain, the Aztecs, and Mexico. Some of them are wonderfully good, but eating them is a matter of choice, not necessity. Much of the Mexican cookery is too intricate for the servantless American housewife. Some of the simpler dishes, however, are worth bringing north of the border. This time I shall write of only three—all easy to make, inexpensive, and good. I have no legitimate recipes for them. They came to me by word of mouth and by watching. Hence, the measurements here are meant as suggestions only. Vary them to suit your fancy and your numbers.

1. Rice soup (Sopa de arroz)
2. Zucchini with pork (Calabacitas )
3. Tortillas with cheese (Tortillas con queso)

Sopa de arroz is not soup, according to North American standards, but a nourishing, one-dish meal for luncheon or dinner. There is no set way to make it. The contents depend more upon the state of the refrigerator and the market basket.

Here is a guiding recipe:

RICE SOUP (Serves Four)
1 cup rice (uncooked)
1 - 2 tbs. Fat
3 - 4 cups of soup stock or water
Page 48

tbs. Chopped onions
cup diced celery
cup green peas
large carrot, sliced
2-3 tomatoes
parsley
salt
Pepper
a few drops of Worcestershire sauce
a few drops of Tabasco sauce

Turn a cup of uncooked rice into a heavy frying pan, sizzling with your favorite shortening. Keep the rice turning until it is seared with fat but not browned. This should take about five minutes. Now turn the rice into a heavy saucepan, which contains the 3 or 4 cups of boiling liquid, preferably soup stock and chicken, if available. Lacking soup stock, use water and bouillon cubes. Add to the rice mixture the sliced onions, which have been sautéed a delicate, golden brown, a cup of diced celery, two or three ripe tomatoes (use canned tomatoes or juice in off seasons), a large carrot sliced in thin wheels, a handful of chopped parsley. Then add the seasonings. When the rice is almost done, remove the cover and place a cup or so of freshly shelled green peas, canned peas or string beans, if you prefer, on top to steam until they are tender. You may also add strips of bell pepper, green or red, or both.

The Mexican way of cooking this dish is to use an open kettle and stir occasionally. Mindful of vitamins, I use a heavy aluminum dish. After the rice is boiling nicely, I turn the heat low and let it steam. You will like the flaky rice and the blend of tastes. Tan Sabroso!

ZUCCHINI WITH PORK (Serves Four)
%-1 Ib. Pork cut in cubes
1 Ib. Zucchini (Italian squash) cut in cubes
2-3 cups corn, fresh or canned
a few strips of chili pepper
salt

Thirty minutes, a few strips of chili pepper, tortillas, sprinkle d place on a May be Care must be take; electric, portable oven jis party amounts. They should once. By themselves a; serve them with a tossed green salad or sliced tomatoes.

Mortensen, President, Phoenix Stake Relief Society, reports that during the year 1946-47 three special projects were sponsored to promote interest and to stimulate activity among the visiting teachers. "'First was a contest in which the teaching requirements were divided into four groups. Each teacher was to make a barometer for each month. These were divided into four parts, and the four phases of teaching activity were each represented by one-fourth of the barometer, which was filled whenever that particular phase of the work was completed. The four phases were: 1. Doing the teaching the first week in the month; 2. Every home contacted; 3. Attendance at visiting teachers meeting; 4. Message given in the home. At the close of the year's work a convention for all visiting teachers was sponsored, at which teachers who had completed their work, as indicated by the barometers, were signally honored and each was presented with a small book as a token of appreciation."

Lesson 7 - "Honored by Strangers, Rejected by His Own" 
Continuation of our Lord's Ministry in Galilee
Elder Don. B. Colton (Reference: Jesus the Christ, Chapters 13 and 14, by Elder James E. Talmage)

For Tuesday, April 6, 1948

Objective: To prove that Jesus is no respecter of persons, but that his blessings are given to all who have faith in him, and who serve him.

In order for one to grasp fully the great work of our Lord, one must know something of the conditions existing among the people in the land where he lived his earthly life. Much bodily work was done, both by Jesus and his disciples, among the people of Samaria. The Samaritans were despised by the Jews, and, in time, this hatred became mutual. The inhabitants of both the province and city of Samaria were a mixed people. The province lay between Judea and Galilee. Assyrians and other heathen nations had intermarried with the Israelites of Samaria, yet all claimed to be descendants of Jacob. Geikie, in his Life and Words of Christ, says, "They (the Samaritans) became even more rigidly attached to the law of Moses than the Jews themselves." The Jews, however, would not recognize these people. Some of the practices between the two groups became utterly ridiculous. Hatred prevented any co-operation.

JESUS TEACHING IN THE SYNAGOGUE

The woman failed to see the spiritual meaning in his words. He then proceeded to give her a significant lesson:

Jesus answered and said unto her, "Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life" (John 4:13-14).

The woman could only see a possible saving of labor, while Jesus was promising eternal spiritual life to a thirsting soul. The Lord also gave the woman a demonstration of his power of discernment.

When he asked her to go get her husband, she replied: "I have no husband." Jesus said unto her, "Thou hast well said, I have no husband: For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband." She knew, then, that she spoke to no ordinary mortal. Jesus had read her innermost thoughts and her past life.

The Samaritan, convinced that Jesus was, at least, a great prophet, went and brought a group of her townspeople. Prior to going, she had remarked: "I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things." To her utter amazement, Jesus replied: "I that speak unto thee am he" (John 4:25-26).

Disregarding the objections of his disciples, Jesus talked to these Samaritans and sowed the seeds that later resulted in a harvest of souls (Acts 8:5-14). The gospel is for every soul who will accept it. That truth was difficult for the disciples of Jesus to comprehend.

After leaving Samaria, our Lord went to Cana. He knew full well that Nazareth would reject him. His remark: "A prophet hath no honour in his own country," is often quoted. A remarkable event occurred at Cana. A nobleman of high rank came and pleaded with Jesus to go on to Capernaum and heal his son. This man was probably an official in Herod's government.

Jesus knew the man's thoughts and said unto him: "Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe." The man, however, continued his importunities, and the merciful Savior finally said to him: "Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way" (John 4:50). The son lived and both the man and his family accepted the gospel.

From Cana, Jesus went again to Nazareth. He found but little faith there. He did, however, go to their service in the synagogue on the Sabbath. He read from the roll, or book, that was handed him, from the sixty-first chapter of Isaiah, a passage specifically referring to the coming of the Messiah. When the eyes of all the congregation were turned toward him, he said: "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears" (Luke 4:21). They scoffed at his claim and tried to throw him over the cliffs of a nearby hill. "But he passing through the midst of them went his way" (Luke 4:30).

At Capernaum and in other parts of Galilee, he preached in the synagogues and did many mighty miracles. He cast out evil spirits from those afflicted. Even the devil cried out: "I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God." He healed the sick, and many were converted - too many probably - by reason of the miracles he performed.

Continuation of the Ministry in Galilee

The observant reader of the New Testament will be impressed with the humility of the Mighty One. He turned so frequently to the Father, whose work he had come to do, and was always so mindful of their relationship that one who wants to follow this great leader must needs be humble.

Simon Peter, and others, wanted Jesus to remain in Capernaum, but he said unto them, "I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also; for therefore am I sent." As he journeyed, a man afflicted with the loathsome disease of leprosy knelt before him and humbly asked: "If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean." Jesus was touched by this pathetic and sincere pleading, and laid his hand upon the afflicted one and cleansed him of the leprosy, although he was full of it (Mark 1:40-45). The Lord fully demonstrated his obedience to law by telling the former leper to immediately report to the priest of the healing and to make the offering required under the Mosaic law. He further charged the man to keep silent regarding the miracle. The Savior quite generally discouraged any publicity.

Shortly after the event just mentioned, Jesus was again in Capernaum. In fact, he seemed to have made his home in this place more than in any other of the cities. He 61 was preaching one day in a house which was so crowded that there was no room nor any way for more people to get in to hear him. There was a man afflicted with palsy. Both he and his friends were anxious to reach Jesus, but were unable to do so. Finally, they devised the ingenious plan of going to the roof and either made a hole or took the sick man through the trapdoor and lowered him, by means of ropes and a mattress, until he was in the presence of Jesus. The Lord first looked with compassion on the sufferer and said: "Son, thy sins be forgiven thee!" The Jews, hearing this, accused him of blasphemy because they felt it was dishonoring God; that no one but God had the right to forgive sins. The Master however, made the statement to the Twelve: "Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained" (John 30:23). This same power was given to Peter on a previous occasion. It is required of us that we forgive all men. God will forgive "whomsoever he will forgive."

A dispute then arose as to whether it is easier to forgive sins or to heal one afflicted with palsy. The Savior, in effect, answered by doing both. He spoke to the palsied man as follows: But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins,... I say unto thee, Arise and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house" (Mark 2:10-11). The man obeyed and to the amazement of the people, was fully healed. The comforting statement, "thy sins be forgiven thee," seems to imply that the man may have been sinful but evidently was repentant, and the Lord was merciful.

Next, we find Jesus at the seaside. At this place, he called Matthew to be one of the Twelve. Although a despised tax collector, Jesus knew Matthew's ability. He was a great student of the Jewish scripture. In the book he later wrote, he quoted copiously from the prophets. It is said that every quotation from the Jewish scripture in the New Testament is found in the Book of Matthew. Jesus knew the true worth of souls.

Jesus here taught another of his immortal lessons, soon after Matthew became one of the Twelve. Some of John the Baptist's disciples came to the Master, claiming that he was not strict enough in observing the law. The disciples of Jesus were not fasting enough; they were dining with publicans and sinners; they were following the pursuits of life in a new way. To the feast Matthew had given at the time of his conversion and call to the ministry, some of the "publicans and sinners" had been invited. Then came the Savior's lesson: They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance (Mark 2:17). Even to this day, how true the doctrine! The spiritually sick need our help. The underprivileged child, the boys and girls who come from broken homes, and all who have strayed from the fold, call for someone who will minister to them in the spirit of the Great Physician.

Will the spiritual teachers of the Church find a way to help the straying souls? Jesus worked with that class. Will we?

The Lord knew the scriptures well, but he constantly offended the Jews by drawing his lessons from life rather than going to the cold letter of the law. One day, as he stood by the Sea of Galilee, a great crowd came to hear him. He improvised a pulpit by getting into a boat and having Simon move the boat a short distance from the shore. He delivered one of his powerful addresses. Drawing from the environment with which they were familiar, as all good teachers do, he said to his disciples: "Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men" (Mark 1:17). Most of them had been fishermen; they were now to fish for souls who could be shown the way to eternal life.

Questions and Suggestions for Discussion

1. In what way does the conversation between Jesus and the woman at Jacob's well show that he was no respecter of persons and that his teachings are for all people? The incident should be carefully studied. How was the Lord's power of discernment shown?

2. Jesus, of course, possessed the power to heal the sick. Relate an incident showing that this power was exercised even when the sick person was not present.

3. Give some of the evidence showing that Jesus always subjected himself to the wishes of his Father.

4. Relate the incident of the calling of Matthew to the ministry. Show that the Lord came to call sinners to repentance.

63 Visiting Teachers' Messages�Our Pioneer Heritage Lesson 7�Building Activities President Amy Brown Lyman For Tuesday, April 6, 1948 Objective: To recognize the high standards in the building activities of the pioneers, which act as a stimulus for us today.

In looking back over Utah's first century, and in evaluating the accomplishments of the Latter-day Saints, their building activities loom large. Not only the number and variety of Latter-day Saint buildings is surprising, but also the style of architecture used, and the stability maintained. It has been the practice of Latter-day Saints to build well. In Nauvoo substantial buildings had been erected by them including the beautiful temple which was destroyed by fire and tornado and even before that time, a temple had been built by them in Kirtland, which is still standing. Naturally, the most famous Latter-day Saint buildings are located in Salt Lake City—the Temple, Tabernacle, and the Assembly Hall, most of the construction of which was done during the first half of the first century of the Church.

Two other attractive old structures are the Lion House and the Beehive House, and near them is the Eagle Gate, all greatly admired by traveling artists and architects. The old Salt Lake Theater, the Social Hall, and the Gardo House, all now gone, were also noted buildings. Scattered throughout the State are other old and noteworthy buildings, including three temples, located in Logan, Manti, and St. George, and a number of attractive tabernacles such as those found in Logan, Brigham City, Provo, St. George, and Coalville. Four additional temples have been erected, in Hawaii, Canada, Arizona, and Idaho Falls, making eight temples which are in use today. These, with the Kirtland and Nauvoo temples, make ten in all which have been built by the Church. Among the many other new and notable Church buildings are the Church Office Building and the Bishop's Building in Salt Lake City, the Joseph Smith Memorial Building, which stands on the Brigham Young University campus in Provo, with other substantial school and seminary buildings, two up-to-date gymnasiums located in Salt Lake and Ogden, and three large, modern hospitals located in Salt Lake, Ogden, and Idaho Falls. And now, in order to extend hospital facilities to remote regions of the Church, a number of smaller hospitals are being established in some of the smaller communities. We point with pride also to our many fine, commodious ward chapels, in connection with which attractive recreation halls have been erected. In addition to these public and Church buildings, hundreds of beautiful and comfortable homes have been built by the individual members of the Church. It can hardly be realized that in one single century a Church with such a small membership, and established faraway in a desert, could accomplish so much in the way of erecting so many permanent, dignified, massive, and architecturally admirable buildings. Latter-day Saints will continue to build magnificently, if they appreciate and build upon the foundation laid by their pioneer ancestors.

Suggestions for Discussion

Some of the teachers might be given an opportunity to mention and describe other Latter-day Saint buildings and features of buildings which they admire, calling attention to the need of preserving historic buildings intact. See pages 24 and 25 for "Relief Society Building News"

Work Meetings
Sewing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting)
Lesson 6—Fitted Facings Jean Ridges Jennings

For Tuesday, March 9, 1948
Reference: The Complete Book of Sewing, Chapter VIII, pp. 65-69; XV, 105, 106; XX, 134, 135.

One of the very useful techniques which has numerous possibilities is that of applying fitted facings. The uses for this finish are almost unlimited. Wherever we find an edge with a curve, a point, or an unusual shape, it is most easily finished with a fitted facing. Although binding, cording, piping, etc., are frequently employed as methods of decorating and completing necks, sleeves, and various other parts of garments, when a plain, inconspicuous, and practical finish is called for, we resort to the fitted facing.

As a general rule, commercial patterns include, with the other pieces, pattern sections by which to cut facings for edges of a garment requiring them. But, in some instances, they are omitted and the user is instructed to cut a bias strip an inch or two in width and employ it as a facing. This method is frequently troublesome, especially if the edge to be faced is curved or shaped. For these cases, it is difficult to obtain a flat and smooth look.

For curved or square neck lines; for edges with a series of scallops, points, or squares; for shaped sleeve edges; for collars, lapels, or pocket flaps, try using fitted facings. It is not necessary to always have a pattern for cutting fitted facings. The edge of the garment itself can serve as a pattern.

Care must be taken to cut the facing in the same shape and size as the edge to be finished, having the grain of the material run in the same direction in both the garment and the facing. If there are seams to be joined, such as at the shoulders of a neck facing, they must be sewed and pressed open and flat, as the first step.

Next, the edge of the facing is placed on top the edge of the garment, the two right sides together, basted in place, and then stitched on the sewing machine, with an even seam allowance all around. At this point, edges with an inside curve must be snipped at frequent intervals so that the facing will not pucker at the edge when it is turned inside. For the same reason we must also snip into the points between scallops and into squared corners to the line of machine stitching.

On outside curves, such as scallops or rounded collars and lapels, notches should be cut out at frequent intervals to avoid too much bulk when the facing is turned. The excess seam must be cut off in the points of collars, cuffs, lapels, etc. The raw edge of the facing is usually finished off by turning under once, stitching it on the sewing machine, or with a small running hand stitching, close to the fold, and then tacking it lightly to the body of the garment.

Of the Doctrine and Covenants
Elder H. Wayne Driggs

Lesson 7—Doctrinal Exposition of the Doctrine and Covenants

For Tuesday, April 20, 1948
Objective: To appreciate the Doctrine and Covenants as literature through a discussion of the wisdom contained in modern scripture.

The most frequent type of writing found in the Doctrine and Covenants is that of doctrinal exposition and instruction. This is not strange, either, when one considers the state of affairs the world was in at the time of Joseph Smith's first vision. So snarled were the concepts of men regarding the way of life that churches had sprung up on the slightest pretext of doctrine. To a youth of questioning mind, such as Joseph, there could be no satisfaction in the evasive turns of reason propounded by the ministers of his day. Small wonder, then, that there was much need for inspired instruction through a latter-day prophet, if the simple truths of the gospel were again to be understood.

As suggested in the title of this modern scripture, the Lord's doctrines and covenants have come to earth again in renewed ways. These throw additional light upon the Priesthood, the Organization, the ordinances and commandments of his Church, and point the way his saints must go to find salvation. The Lord has spoken to us in this day in the language which we can understand.

Note the following passages:
Treasure up in your minds continually the words of life (84:85).
For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads (25:12).

Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness; for the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in no wise lose their reward (58:27-28). For this is a day of warning, and not a day of many words. For I, the Lord, am not to be mocked in the last days (63:58). Behold, now it is called today until the coming of the Son of Man, and verily it is a day of sacrifice, and a day for the tithing of my people; for he that is tithed shall not be burned at his coming (64:23). I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise (82:10). Yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith (88:118). Cease to be idle; cease to be unclean; cease to find fault one with another; cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated (88:124). And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones; and shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures; and shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint. And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them. Amen (89:18-21). For man is spirit. The elements are eternal, and spirit and element, inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy; and when separated, man cannot receive a fulness of joy. The elements are the tabernacle of God; yea, man is the tabernacle of God, even temples; and whatsoever temple is defiled, God shall destroy that temple. The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth (93:33-36). Verily, verily, I say unto you, that when I give a commandment to any of the sons of men to do a work unto my name, and those sons of men go with all their might and with all they have to perform that work, and cease not their diligence, and their enemies come upon them and hinder them from performing that work, behold, it behooveth me to require that work no more at the hands of those sons of men, but to accept of their offerings. And the iniquity and transgression of my holy laws and commandments I will visit upon the heads of those who hindered my work, unto the third and fourth generation, so long as they repent not, and hate me, saith the Lord God (124:49, 50). It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance (131:6). Here is writing with the inspiration of divinity. Activities and Readings for Appreciation The discussion for this class period may well be spent in reading a number of sections of the Doctrine and Covenants which bring added light to the gospel. For example, in the 93 section, the Lord defines the relationship between himself and the Father, in the following verses 1-5: Verily, thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am; and that I am the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world, and that I am in the Father, and the Father in me, and the Father and are one—the Father because he gave me of his fulness, and the Son because I was in the world and made flesh my tabernacle, and dwelt among the sons of men. I was in the world, and received of my Father, and the works of him were plainly manifest. This section 93 also deals with the record of John, the apostle and revelator, Jesus Christ, the Firstborn, the place of man in the beginning with God, the eternal nature of the elements, and the glory of God. It is the direct and forceful manner of this inspired scripture that appeals. Call upon the class to read carefully each part of this section outlining the above doctrines and note for discussion the clarity of language and style of expression. Single out those passages which are best remembered. Additional sections for similar discussions may be found under the numbers 27, 29, 84, 88, 107. There are others which may be suggested by the class. Be ready to read and discuss a favorite passage of instruction you have loved from the Doctrine and Covenants.

Social Science-Essentials in Home Training Lesson 6- Tolerance Elder Joseph Jacobs
For Tuesday, April 27, 1948
Objective: To show that the teachings of the Lord breathe the spirit of tolerance, and that tolerance is not acceptance.
What Is Tolerance?
It was Voltaire who said, "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it." Such is the spirit of tolerance. Tolerance is a calm, generous respect for the opinions of others, even of one's enemies. It recognizes the right of every man to think his own thoughts, to live his own life, to be himself in all things, so long as he does not run counter to the rights of others. It means giving to others the same freedom that we ourselves crave (William George Jordan: The Power of Truth, page 97).

Wherein Do We See the Tolerance of Christ Manifest?
Christ's teachings exemplified tolerance. During his ministry, the Savior was accused of consorting with the sinners and publicans and with many people whom the accusers thought beneath his station. Jesus' reply to this accusation was: They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick ... for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance (Matt 9:12, 13). Tolerance makes a distinction between the sin and the sinner. The Lord himself said: For I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance; nevertheless, he that repents and does the commandments of the Lord shall be forgiven (D&C 1:31-32). We are not to condone sin nor partake of it in any form, but neither should we judge the sinner: "I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men" (D&C 64:10). When the woman taken in adultery was brought before Christ, the scribes and Pharisees sought to trap Jesus because the law of Moses decreed that such should be stoned: "But what sayest thou?" they demanded. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.

So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee? She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more (John 8:6-11). His admonition, "go and sin no more," gave her new hope for the future. Only God can see the strivings, the desires, the real intent of a person's heart. We see only the outward manifestations, and so we are not qualified to judge. When we sit in solemn judgment of the acts and characters of those around us and condemn them with the easy nonchalance of our ignorance,... We reveal our intolerance (William George Jordan: The Power of Truth, page 105).

What Is the Latter-day Saint Viewpoint Regarding Religious Tolerance? As Latter-day Saints, in reviewing the past history of our Church, we know the venom of religious intolerance. It seems incredible that men could heap such vicious hatred upon any people because of their religious views, however, the pages of history are filled with accounts of the awful persecution of the innocent because of religion. Tolerance for the religious beliefs of others is part of the Latter-day Saint doctrine. Our 11th Article of Faith says: We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may. Free agency is an eternal principle by means of which God permits us to work out our own destiny. The right of every man to live as he sees fit is a sacred privilege. At one time the Prophet Joseph Smith was asked how he governed so many people harmoniously in one faith. His reply was simple but full of wisdom: "I teach them correct principles and they govern themselves." The incident is related that when the members of the Catholic church first began to hold meetings in Salt Lake City they had no place in which to meet and the use of the old Tabernacle was offered to them. And so they made use of this building for their services. President Brigham Young was also instrumental in getting the title cleared when they purchased their first property here. This was an example of true religious tolerance.

68 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�JANUARY 1948 LESSON DEPARTMENT

When we desire to show others the truths we have in our gospel, we should seek to do it in a spirit of love and gentleness, kindness and humility. Never does tolerance use the sting of sarcasm or the taunt of ridicule. In a recent lecture given before a group of missionaries soon to go into the mission field, this statement was made: "Vanity is the one thing that may make a missionary fail. Humility is essential." We have no right to be smug or overbearing about our religion. Ours should be a spirit of humble gratitude that we have been privileged to partake of the gospel. Only by our good works, our kindness, and patience may we influence others to see the worth of gospel principles.

Speaking of the power of the Priesthood, we read in the Doctrine and Covenants, 121:41, 42: No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned; by kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile.

How Has Tolerance Played Its Part in Making America Great? The greatness of the American nation is very largely due to the tolerance of its people for the different groups included within its boundaries. Through the contributions of each group, progress and advancement have been made possible to a degree undreamed of in any other nation. Its broad privileges and opportunities reach out and encompass all nationalities and creeds.

The present troubles in Palestine, India, and China are directly traceable to the intolerance of one group for another.

We need tolerance toward other races and nations. Human emotions are the same in all parts of the world, and until there can be friendship and consideration for each other and each other's problems, strife will exist.

To learn to get on with people, to learn to win them to willing co-operation, to mutual understanding, to mutual respect, is one of the most valuable things we can do in life. You can only do it first by cultivating the habit of looking for good in other people, not their faults. One small thing is worth noticing.

Albert Victor BariLuiE, the Dean of Windsor: The Making of a Man, page 118

Intolerance believes it is born with the peculiar talent for managing the affairs of others, without any knowledge of the details, better than the men themselves, who are giving their life's thought to the vital questions.... Let us not seek to fit the whole world with shoes from our individual last (William George Jordan: The Power of Truth, page 104).

Because I enjoy a certain type of music or a certain kind of book is no reason you should appreciate the same. Because I choose one profession is no reason yours is not equally important and beneficial to mankind. Because I do my work in a certain manner is no reason I should disdain your way.

Tolerance helps us to recognize and respect the differences in others and to make allowance for those differences. It enables us to respect differences in opinion, in disposition, in training, in environment, in education, in ability and opportunity. Intolerance seeks to live other people's lives for them; sympathy helps us to live their lives with them.... No one of us is infallible... Let us accept the little failings of those around us as we accept facts in nature, and make the best of them, as we accept the hard shells of nuts, the skin of fruits, the shadow that always accompanies light....

Intolerance sees the mote in its neighbor's eye as larger than the beam in its own.

Instead of concentrating our thought on the one weak spot in a character, let us seek to find some good quality that offsets it, just as a credit may more than cancel a debt on a ledger account.... Let us not constantly speak of roses having thorns, let us be thankful that the thorns have roses.... Measuring a man by his weakness alone is unjust. This little frailty may be but a small mortgage on a large estate.... (WILLIAM GEORGE Jordan: The Power of Truth, pp. 106, 107, 108).

There is a grave danger, of course, lest we admire tolerance merely in the abstract. We may see that it is needed in government, international affairs, and in business, and overlook the fact that it is needed equally in our own home. It is not enough that we be theoretically tolerant toward another nation if we are narrow toward the man in the next office.... Of all the commandments, "Love thy neighbor" is the least enforceable, the most voluntary (The Reader's Digest, February 1946, page 15).

How May Tolerance Be Fostered in the Home?

Tolerance in the home is vital to harmony and to happy, normal development. Parents must learn early that no two of their children are alike, nor can they be treated the same. One may exhibit a tendency which may never make its appearance in the disposition of another. One may be shy and reserved and may need more praise, kindness, and stimulation to develop his character, while another may try to dominate and show off, or there may be many variations between these two extremes.

70 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�JANUARY 1948 LESSON DEPARTMENT

One child may have a distinct talent for music while another may never be able to carry a tune, but may show outstanding mechanical ability. One mother said that in disciplining her two boys, the same treatment would never apply to both. If the elder son noticed she had been crying over something he had done, he was immediately contrite and anxious to make amends; but if she ever shed tears over the younger one, he became disgusted and angry.

Intolerance manifests itself in suppression of individuality, in stern prohibitions and penalties. An intolerant parent may endeavor to break the will of a child instead of directing it in channels suited to its disposition. Confidence, sympathy, and love are the attributes which work wonders with children. President George Albert Smith has said, "If you can't get a person to do what you wish through love, there is no other way." Leading is much more successful than driving.

Parents should not set themselves up as dictators to rule the every thought and word of a child. A few basic rules should be set up and then the individuality of each member of the family should be allowed to express itself. Sometimes parents are slow to realize that their children have grown up and can think for themselves. There comes a day when they are adults and desire to solve their own problems. Love and kindly advice, however, will always be valued, if the proper relationship has been built up during the early years.

Let us be tolerant of the weakness of others, sternly intolerant of our own. Let
