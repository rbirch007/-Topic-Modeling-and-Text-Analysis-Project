New Year S Greetings HE wings of time have once again flown in a New Year. With its advent, the General Presidency extends affectionate greetings to Relief Society sisters throughout the Church. Your labors of the past year have borne good fruit. To you as individuals has come life enrichment, those whom you have helped on life's way have been blessed, and the organization of which you are a part has been strengthened by your good deeds. Regardless of how well the past has been met, however, with the dawning of a New Year there stirs within each of us feelings of new beginnings, a desire to start afresh, hopes that tomorrow will be better than today, and a determination to shape our lives more adequately to mect life's obligations and thus realize greater happiness in living. We are living in a great, wide, beautiful, wonderful world filled with endless resources for our well-being and happiness, Almost daily new wonders present themselves adding interest, length, and comfort to life. All about us we see evidence of the love, kindness, and benefactions of a Heavenly Father, lavish in providing for his children upon earth. Not only has he generously given to us the materials out of which we may build a good life, but he has taught us how to build. He has made clear what follows our every act. He has given us an irrevocable plan of life and salvation. Through his prophets he has made known his will for his children and has commanded us in all things. Nonetheless he has given us Our free agency to make choices for ourselves. Upon these choices rests the form our lives shall take. Upon them depend our productivity, happiness, and cternal well-being. The choices we make throughout the coming year will control in large measure the realization of today's desires, ambitions, and hopes. Today's dreams may be tomorrow's fulfillments if we choose aright, and having chosen, exercise the self-discipline and self-mastery that lead to action in accordance with our choices. To each Relief Society sister we say, "What will be your choices this New Year? Will you choose to rid yourself of encumbering and nonessential activities which complicate your life and interfere with your joy in hving? Will you choose to be more sensitive to the desires, hopes, and needs of your husband and your children? Will you choose to devote vourself more fully to the rewarding labors of your home? Will you choose to expand your friendships, and deepen those with which you are already blessed? Will vou choose to reach out more frequently and more willingly to help a neighbor in distress? Will you choose to become better acquainted with what the Lord would have you do, and in appreciation for Page | 2 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1960 his goodness and the abundance of his blessings, will you choose to serve him more devotedly? Having made these choices, will you exercise the will to act in harmony with them?" If so, the New Year will be a fruitful and a happy one for you. Peace will reign in your heart. 'The evil impacts of life, over which you have little or no control, life's strains and sorrows which are the common lot of man will leave you unbowed and unbroken. The Lord has told us "... Fear not little flock; do good; let earth and hell combine against you, for if ye are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail." Our earnest prayer for the sisters of Relief Society is that the worthiness of their lives as wives, mothers, homemakers, Relief Society members, and Latter-day Saint women may bring to them throughout the new year an abundance of the choice blessings of our Heavenly Father.

Cover Design by Evan Jensen Cover Lithographed in Full Color by Deseret News Press Jn ITlemoriam President Amy Brown Lyman President Belle S. Spafford (This address was delivered at the funeral services for Sister Lyman held in the TwentySeventh Ward Meeting House, Salt Lake City, Utah, Tuesday, December 8, 1959.) N speaking at this service today, I feel a deep sense of responsibility to Sister Lyman whom [| loved, to her family and friends, and to Relief Society, over which she presided as its eighth General President, and whose affairs she influenced as a member of the General Board for many years. This is an important and sacred occasion. It marks the close of earth life for one of our Father's favored daughters. Sister Lyman has completed her earthly work. She has fulfilled her mission and now goes on to a new sphere of action, rich in the experiences of earth life. Sister Lyman has lived an eventful and colorful life here upon earth. Born amid the rigors of pioneer days in the little village of Pleasant Grove, nestled at the foot of loftv Mount Timpanogos, a village which she loved, she took advantage of the opportunities life afforded and made her earth life a fruitful one. Her life has been rich i experiences, progressive in viewpoint, extensive in service, and broad in influence. She has met each day with a keen interest in its affairs, and with judgment and courage she has responded to the requirements each day has made of her. Sister Lyman, I believe, was born generously endowed with talents and leadership capacity. 'hese she has continuously enlarged upon. They have cast her into roles of leadership, both within and without the Church. I believe I speak advisedly, however, when I say that among the many organizations and groups to which she gave her talents and leadership abilities, none superseded Relief Society in importance in her mind and heart. Relief Society was her great love. Just as she loved Relief Society, so she loved Relief Society women. She has said of her work in Relief Society and of the sisters, and I quote: I am grateful for the opportunities I have had of serving my Church... Particularly in the Relief Society, where during most of my mature life I have worked so happily and contentedly with its thousands of members. I have visited in their homes, slept in their beds, eaten at their tables, and have thus learned of their beauty of character, their unselfishness, their understanding hearts, their faithfulness and their sacrifices. I honor beyond my power of expression this great sisterhood of service. Sister Lyman was called to the General Board in 1909, during the presidency of Sister Bathsheba W. Smith. Prior to this time she had been a member of the society in her own ward, and, in her childhood Page 3 PRESIDENT AMY BROWN LYMAN Page 4 PRESIDENT AMY BROWN LYMAN home, she had been taught to honor this organization as a great humanitarian society. As a member of the General Board, her special talents were soon recognized, and, in 1911, she was named Assistant General Secretary, a position she held for two years, when she was appointed General Secretary. In this responsible post she served for fifteen years, being relieved only to take over the responsible duties of First Counselor in the General Presidency. She served as a Counselor for eleven years until she was called by President Heber J. Grant, in January 1940, to become Gencral President of Relief Society, an office she held for five years. A total of thirty-six vears she gave to the work of the Relief Society General Board — testimony enough of her love for Relief Society and her belief in its divine mission. URING the thirty-six years she identified herself with the General Board, she took part in many interesting developments in_ the work of Relief Society and plaved an important part in the expansion of its programs. 'Time permits mention of only a few of these activities. Under the presidency of President Emmeline B. Wells, she took an active part in modernizing the business affairs of the society, including those of stakes and wards. When she assumed the duties of General Secretary, Relief Society headquarters were not equipped as they are today. There were no typewriters, no filing cabinets, no adding machines or mimeograph machines. There was no typist and no bookkeeper. It was not long, however, until necessary equipment for efD ficient work was obtained and good business and bookkeeping _ procedures established. During her time as General Secretary, uniform ward record books and visiting teacher report books were introduced. 'These were unportant, not only in standardizing the record keeping, but the work itself. For more than thirtv years she was associated with the business management of The Relief Society Magazine. For parts of two years She acted as Magazine Editor. She loved and supported the Afagazinec to the hour of her death. She frequently called me, commenting on some new feature or expressing appreciation for some article, referring to the Magazine "as a dearly beloved child to her." Indeed she must have loved it always, for in the days of its beginning, days of abject poverty for it, she and Sister Jeannette Hyde went from busincss house to business house soliciting advertising in order to finance the Magazine, and with the help of their children, they wrapped and mailed the publication in order that it might continue to exist. She was active in the development of good educational programs and served as chairman in the preparation of the first Relicf Society Handbook published in 1931. Iam sure she is happy today that the Singing Mothers are represented here. It was through her great vision and foresight and wise action that the Singing Mothers program was guided into one of ward and stake choruses, which could be combined for General Relief Society Conference, rather than having one (Continued on page 46) Obedience to the Truth President Joseph Fielding Smith Of the Council of the Twelve (Address Delivered at the Officers Meeting of the Annual General Relief Society Conference, October 7, 1959) feel it an honor to be asked to come and address this great body of sisters. As I have been sitting here, I have been thinking of the ages past and how the women, members of the Church, were invited always to take back seats and keep silent in the churches. Paul, himself, gave counsel to that effect, that the women should be silent, and if they wanted to know anything about the gospel thev were to ask their husbands at home. Well, I am grateful that that day is not now. I am grateful that the Lord revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith that there is a work for the sisters in the Church to perform, and there are responsibilities which rest upon them just as well as there are responsibilities resting on the shoulders of the brethren. Salvation is not something that is confined solely to the men, the women have to be saved also, and they are saved by the same principles and ordinances. It is just as important that a woman repent of her sins, believe the truth, accept it, and be baptized for the remission of her sins and to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, as it is for a man. 'The same principles that save the men will save the women. There is one glorious thought that has been given to us through the revelations to the Prophet Joseph Smith and that is that the men Page 6 S [STER Spafford and sisters, I cannot be saved alone, neither can the women. In order to fulfill the purposes of our Eternal Father, there must be a union, husbands and wives receiving the blessings that are promised to those who are faithful and true that will exalt them to Godhood. A man cannot receive the fulness of the blessings of the kingdom of God alone, nor can the woman, but the two together can receive all the blessings and privileges that pertain to the fulness of the Father's kingdom. 'The women will become quecns, priestesses, in the eternal order that the Lord has given for the fulness of his kingdom. 'The gospel means just as much to our sisters as it does to the brethren. 'They are just as much concerned in it as are the brethren. And when the Lord said to the Prophet Joseph Smith, "Search these commandments, for they are true and faithful, and the prophecies and promises which are in them shall all be fulfilled," he did not limit that commandment to the male members of the Church. 'This revelation from which I have quoted begins as follows: Hearken, O ve people of my church, saith the voice of him who dwells on high, and whose eyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken ye people from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together (D & C 1:1). Now, people include both men OBEDIENCE TO THE TRUTH and women. When we say this people or that people, we don't just single out the men. It means everybody. 'Therefore, it is just as important that our sisters understand the Plan of Salvation as it is for the men. It is just as essential that they keep the commandments. No woman is going to be saved in the kingdom of God without baptism for the remission of sins and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. Now someone might read what's in our scriptures and conclude to the contrary. UR sisters are entitled just as much to the inspiration for their needs of the Holy Spirit as are the men, every bit. 'They are entitled to the gift of prophecy concerning matters that would be essential for them to know as it is for the men. When they pray they should pray earnestly, expecting to have an answer to their pravers. The Lord will hear them, if they are earnest, true, just as well as he will the brethren. Now I can remember the struggle that the women of this country went through in order to get the franchise. I am sorry to say that after they got it, many of them have failed to know just how to use it. They haven't been any worse than the men, but, nevertheless, they had to struggle in order to obtain that great gift or blessing and have a voice in the Government. The women have a voice in the government of the Church. When someone lS appointed to an office, we do not ask the men only to vote, but we ask the whole congregation. The women have a right to raise their hands. They have a right to speak. And it was by the inspira- 7 tion of the Almighty that the Relief Society came into existence. 'The Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association, and the Primary, give our sisters opportunity to teach, to give instruction, as well as to learn. When the Lord said that no person could be saved in ignorance, I think he meant women as well as he did men, and I think the women of the Church are under the obligation of studying the scriptures just as well as for the men. Now, we are living in a day of turmoil, strife, and contention, I think nearly as bad as the world has ever seen. 'There may have been times worse, but I don't know of any other or reading of anything worse than what we are getting today — the violation of law, the selfishness of men, the greed, the ambitions, the turning away from faith in God. I think we are getting today, speaking of the world, in a very serious condition in relation to matters of that kind. Even the so-called Christian churches are moderating the doctrines, changing them. Many of them today are beginning—if they have not already reached the point—of denying the divinity of Jesus Christ. Now, I I think as far as the women are concerned, if they believe that sort of thing they learned it from the men. The gospel is just as true today as it was in the days. Of the Lord, Jesus Christ, when he came to trestore it. 'Vhe mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith is just as necessary today as it was in the beginning. The need of mankind to know that God lives and Jesus Christ is his Son, the Redeemer of the world, the Savior of men, is just as vital today as it has ever been. It is just as true as it was when Peter, 8 James, and John, and Paul were teaching. 'The world needs repentance today just as much as it ever did. OW it is my opinion, and I have a very strong opinion to that effect, that this world is rapidly reaching the point when the cup of iniquity will be full, and we send our missionaries out to warn the people. Among those missionaries now, for many, many vears, we have been sending our sisters. 'They have been doing a good work. Now the Lord says: Verily I savy unto you, that they who go forth bearing these tidings unto the inhabitants of the earth, to them is power given to seal both on earth and in heaven, the unbelieving and_ rebellious; yea, verily, to seal them up unto the day when the wrath of God shall be poured out upon the wicked without measure (D & C 1:8-g). I think that day of wickedness is rapidly drawing upon us. We need the help of our sisters, you good sisters of the Relief Society, to help us teach the principles of eternal truth just as well as we do the elders of the Church. You can teach it in vour organizations. Our sisters need to be taught, manv of them, just as well as do our brethren. We have sisters in the Church who are losing their faith. We have sisters who love the world more than they do the kingdom of God. 'There is plenty of work to do for the sisters of the Relief Society and of the Mutual Improvement Association. We, the Latter-day Saints, should keep ourselves in order, humble, sincere, obeying the commandments of the Lord. Otherwise, those who rebcl shall be removed RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1960 out of their place, the Lord said it. Today there is a condition existing in this country among our youth. When I read the papers, our own local papers here, it seems to me that those same conditions are creeping into our communities. Our young people are becoming rebellious, filled with the spirit of wickedness, and something ought to be done as far as we are concerned to see if we can't correct it. I hope that these young men who caught a young man on his way home and beat him up were not, any of them, members of the Church, sons of members of the Church. I hope that is not getting in among our people. I hope that our good sisters will join, if they have not joined, the Relief Society, instead of going out to join clubs to play cards and waste their time while their children, perhaps, roam the streets. Our Mutual Improvement Association has a slogan which is only half of the sentence, "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth." Now we have cut that off right in the middle. I have no objection to it. It is all right, but that is what the Lord said, "the glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth." Then he said, "Light and truth forsake that evil one." Well, we want to live so that the evil power will have no influence with us, and we want to exercise our responsibilities in the Relief Society and in the other organizations to keep this commandment. "Light and truth forsake that evil one," says the Lord. VERY spirit of man was innocent in the beginning. God having redeemed man from the Fall, OBEDIENCE TO THE TRUTH men became again in their infant state, innocent before God. Every child born into this world is innocent. No matter what he did before he came here, he comes here innocent, as far as this life is concerned. Every spirit of man was innocent in the beginning, and God having redeemed man from the Fall, men became again in their infant state, innocent before God. We should remember that. But here's our trouble, that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience, from the children of men, and because of the tradition of their fathers. But I have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth (D & C 93:39-40). That is the commandment to the members of the Church. Now our sisters of the Relief Society can help in this matter, as can the other organizations, to see that the children of the Latter-day Saints obey counsel, understand the truth, walk in its light, are taught to pray, and have a love for their fellow men. We don't want our sisters, because of responsibilities given to them in the organizations of the Church, to have to neglect their families. We don't want any sister in the Relief Society to have to 9 attend her meetings and at the same time leave her children to run the streets. If her Church duties require her attention, then she should see to it that some provision is made to care for her children, if she has children, that they might be protected and taught to pray and to be faithful and true, and brought up in light and truth. That is our responsibility. No, we do not want any sister to neglect her responsibility, but we do not want her to have to do it at the sacrifice of children by neglect, leaving them to find bad company or to be idle. Let us see to it that our children, if we are called into the work of the ministry in this regard, are provided for, that they have protection. We are in a wicked world. I know there are good people in the world, yes. But the Lord says it is wicked, and if he says it is wicked, I think maybe I can, too, and I think it is getting more so every day. We have many responsibilities, but none of them to cause us to neglect our homes. I bless you good sisters. JI am grateful that you are engaged in this work. It is necessary. It is part of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and so I leave my blessing with you in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. Lo One Soo Poor Zara Sabin The quick kind words our neighbor needs Are hard sometimes to give. We lack the practice. He succeeds Who early learns to live For others, vaunting not his own Nor envying.

The "Lamb" that warmed the multitudes, Still sheds warmth on my dream, Bound to me by her linen thread, A prayer, and a seam. With little save her faith, she brought The star to a quilting frame, And cloth repeats, now hands are still, Her meaning of love's name. My fingers walk the even hills Her measured stitches laid, The miles, the years, her needle took— That beds be warmly made. When waiting slumber's sustenance, I traced the lines she grooved, Finding a richer vein than sleep, Where her swift fingers moved. And still, when sleep has failed to come, More calm, I wait the light, Because she placed this comforter Between me and the night. Dorothy Jensen Roberts, Salt Lake City, Utah, tells us that she enjoys working with words and experimenting with their lovely sounds and learning their intricate and exacting meanings: "The total power of words is not known to us, but, uttered at a crucial time, words can make or break a life. Our words are our prophets, our sorrow or our solace, and, in a measure, our immortality. "The Eliza R. Snow Poem Contest is a challenge to express ourselves im an exciting and enjoyable tradition. I am thrilled and proud to be an award winner in this contest for the fourth time, along with other State and local contests I have won, including the Deseret News Christmas Poem Contest.

Our world is winter as we face the West, Stiff-booted feet upon unyielding soil, We walk into the summer's ash, divest Of comfort, dedicated to our toil. A handcart carries sustenance for life: The grain, a kettle, all our woolen stuff, A spade, a Bible, courage of a knife; Two candlesticks for beauty are enough, I kneel in prayer upon the frozen crust, "Preserve me, God, in thee I put my trust." 13 14 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1960 Noon The white waste washes in against my eyes, In wholeness, broken by a shallow grave. My ears are burdened by the children's crics; I cross the gentle hands that made them brave, Place the willows, stones, a bit of loam Upon the rose that sanctifies this tomb. Love, yours is a crucl unfriendly home; Hard earth is grudging of that meager room. Tears that once could warm my face and hands Are prisoned underneath an icy veil; Desolate the view my heart commands, Long, long and lonely winds the rutted trail. "Give me new strength of soul, with force of will, I cannot bide the good and not the ill." Night The skies have prophesied the builded West In silhouetted phantoms, gray and gold, And spilled the soothing wines the day has pressed Into a sea of blackness, deep and cold. Our nights can raise us high above this sphere, And thrill our vision with a galaxy, But stars are chil] and distant. I am here With all I need to fix my destiny. Somewhere ahead there is a greening field, A spring that rises from the colored stones, A sun-warmed earth whose fertile womb will yield To planting, where the westerly has blown. And thou, who gave vicissitudes to men, Shall lift me up and quicken me again. Lucille Rampton Perry, Woods Cross, Utah, is a first-time winner in the Eliza R. Snow Poem Contest. She tells us: "J am the wife of Curtis S. Perry, and mother to six children, two boys and four girls. Mly oldest son is a freshman at the University of Utah, and my youngest daughter is four years old. At present I am first counselor in the South Bountiful Second Ward Primary. I have been writing poetry for only two or three years, and this is my first real accomplishment in poetry, except for one other poem which was published in The Relief Society Magazine last year. Mly interest since childhood has been primarily in drawing and painting. Family responsibilities have forced me to set this interest aside for awhile. Poetry has given me much satisfaction. I belong to a small group who meet for an hour every other week to study and criticize cach other's poetry, and this has been very helpful to me. Some day I would like to combine my interests in writing and painting and illustrate some work of my own." PRIZE-WINNING POEMS EVA WILLES WANGSGAARD Third Prize Poem Loam-Stained Eva Willes Wangsgaard All day the hungry gulls Followed my plow, Rising to wheel and cry, All quiet now. Calm are these russet waves. Breakers of gold Wait for the way of sun And seed in the mould. Wide-flung on unseen masts Luminous sails Wait in the evening skies Westering gales. 5 16 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1960 Crossed now by tardy wings Limned on red light, Pressed by twin urgencies, Aloneness and night. Loam-stained as mine her feet, Our path the same. Transformed by light she gleams Winging through flame. Now for a heartbeat's span, Lifted, light-pure, I wear her silver wings Homebound and sure. Eva Willes Waugsgaard, Ogden, Utah, was born in Lehi, Utah, and attended high school there, later attending the University of Utah and Utah State University. Mrs. Wangsgaard began writing after her three children were grown, and was past forty before she wrote her first poem. "Unlike most writers I have known," Mrs. Wangsgaard tells us, "I never had a craving or longing to write. The poems came with such urgency and such volume the first year that I was forced to recognize the need. After that I studied as I wrote. My poetry education was acquired chiefly by correspondence lessons and by self-study. Now I have five books of poetry: Singing Hearts, Down This Road, After the Blossoming, Within the Root, and Shape of Earth. I was included this year in Who's Who in Poetry International, published in London, England. I have published in many magazines and newspapers in America, in England, and in India. I have three children, all living in Cache Valley, Utah, thirteen living grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. This autumn I was notified that I had won the Aleda Hall Lyric Award sponsored by a poets' forum in Miami, Florida." — Dust of &very-Dayness Celia Luce E were driving past a hillside of gray rocks, or so they seemed to us. Then the road veered closer to the hillside and moved through a cut. Here the rock had been blasted away. We found that the rock was not gray at all, but delighted us with its red and golden hues. 'The rock had been covered by gray dust from the hillside above, so looked gray. I was reminded of how we put a gray veil of every-dayness over the people and things about us, seldom stopping really to look at them and enjoy their sparkle and beauty. We have become so used to them that we ignore them. We sometimes even put a veil of gray every-dayness over our relations with God. Sometimes it takes the blasting of trouble to tear away the gray veil and wake us up to the rare beauty of the everyday joys.

Win nin g S tO ry Sead Relief Society Short Story Contest First Prize Story Summer's Grace Deonc R. Sutherland DEONE R. SUTHERLAND T' was one of those days when the hot noon sunlight overflowed and shimmered before our feet. Even with the hose running all day, the daisies wilted and the grass browned. The green vines reddened on the trellises before their time, and we sat in the windless air of our tired apple tree and dreamed of sudden frosts and faraway Alps where snow glimmcers above cooling clouds. Almy and I lifted our noses to the air. We slid down the tree with me first to guide Almy's feet. Through the screen door we could Page 18 see Mama moving back and forth in the kitchen. Marjorie came out the back door wiping her forehead. "She's baking a cake!" "A wiggily cake," we breathed. But Marjorie had gone to sit in the apple cellar. It was cool there, but Almy didn't like the spiders. Besides, Marjorie had a book, and if we fooled with the cider press or made a noise, it meant trouble. We crouched in the shade of the house. A wiggily cake rose four glorious layers high with sweet cream custard nestled between the white layers. I looked on Almy tenderly. Wer round brown cheeks and rosy mouth looked happy as she patted her own dirt cake together and frosted it with white dust. "Maud!" Mama's voice brought Almy and me racing to the back porch. In the kitchen the wiggily cake rose grandly above the cake plate with the silver leaves edging the frosting. Mama was busily tearing off wax paper and adjusting toothpicks. "Can I trust you to carry this ever so gently down to Mrs. Fanshawe's? She's sick today, and with nine children." Reluctantly we said goodbye to the wiggily cake. Almy's lip turned out. Her dark brows drew down SUMMER'S GRACE threateningly, but Mama _ never noticed. She was busy changing into a fresh apron and tidying the soft hair that clung to her cheeks. Mama's kiss was swift and sweet on my cheek. She lifted Almy for a kiss and a hug, though Almy weighed a ton. "Keep an eye on Almy,' Mama cautioned me confidently. I nodded reassuringly. When you were with Mama, you never minded giving away all the cakes in the world. It was only afterwards, while you were walking down the dusty road and the cake smelled and smelled in your hands that you minded. Almy begged for finger-licks at the edge. It was hard to give her some and not disturb the silver leaves. "They'll not notice,' I soothed my conscience, though Almy's hands showed traces of her own cake making. We minded most of all going up the dusty lane with the barefoot Fanshawe kids crowding in upon us, hungry eyes fastened on the towering cake. We had hungry eyes, too, I wanted to shout to them. Mary took the cake at the door. "Mamia's sick," she said shyly. "Yes, we know." "We'll bring back the plate," they shouted after us. It was a refrain we'd heard too many times. Our dog Jake came running crookedly to meet us. "Go away," I grumbled at his wild wagging. He was really one of Mr. Johnson's pups that he'd tried to drown, but Mama had caught him at it. Finally, Papa had held a private talk with Mr. Johnson. After all, Mama could take in only so many dogs and cats and all. Mr. Johnson agreed to go some place farther 19 away to dispose of stray animals than the canal dividing our property. "How is your wonderful Mother?" Mr. Clough's horse pranced in the road. We told him proudly how well Mother was. "She is a fine woman." Mr. Clough leaned over and looked at us sternly. We felt a thrill of pride for Mother, and a twinge of conscience for our own shortcomings. We would never grow up to feed every gypsy who came begging, or take in every Indian who knocked at the door, as Papa says Mama does. We turned in our yard, looking furtively over the hedge at the lawn. No, Mama's dark patchwork quilt was not stretched across the grass with a rumpled tramp resting in the shade while Mama's green pitcher of ice water tipped in his hand. FE circled the back yard. There was no wild hammering from the shed while Mama _ knocked something together for one of God's poor wild things to rest in while it recovered from some calamity that would have killed it for sure, if Mama hadn't stepped in. We opened the back door, and there eating bread and milk at the table and staring wildly at us with red-rimmed eyes sat a girl we'd never seen before. She clutched a gray shawl at her throat while the perspiration ran in rivulets into her eyes. "She doesn't speak a word of English, poor girl. Her cough is terrible, but we'll fix that." Mama was brewing herbs on the back of the stove. 'Don't stare, children; we'll have to fix the bed on the back porch." She looked pleadingly at us, for it was the only 20 cool place to sleep in the summer. Marjorie helped Mama _ change the bed. Almy and I went back to look at the girl. Papa stood in the doorway. "What's this, Edith? What's this?" He swung Almy to his shoulder, and I snuggled inside his arm. "T can't get her to let go of the shawl, John. No matter what I do, she hangs on so to it. It's so hot. You do something, can you, dear?" Papa put Almy down, and I lost my nest under his arm. He made a sweeping bow and held out his hand for the shawl. The girl's large bluc eves brightened, and she giggled, 'Ja,' and handed her shawl to Papa, who hung it gingerly on the hooks by the back door. "Wonderful," Mama said delightedly, while Papa wiped the dampness from her forehead and kissed both her eyes. "Where did she come from, Edith?" Papa washed industriously in the basin, "T thought I heard a knock, but no one was there. I felt something was wrong. Poor thing, she was going back through the field to the railroad track....' Mama lifted the yellow corn from the steaming kettle. "What if I had not found her... 2? Not a word of English." Papa sat down to the table, and we bowed our heads. "Where is this German girl on her way to, Edith?" Mother unrolled a crumpled envclope and paper from her pocket and handed it to Papa. "Mr. And Mrs. Herman Hergesheimer...." Papa laid down his work carefully. "Why, they sold out and moved away more than four months ago." Mama nodded gently. "No wonRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1960 der she's terrified. We'll have to trace them somehow for her." Papa leaned his head against his hand. "Couldn't someone else have found her, Edith?" Mama lifted her head. "She is our neighbor, John. We must help her." Papa groaned, "Sometimes I wish I were your neighbor!" AMA'S eyes widened and filled with tears which she quickly blinked away. Papa went around the table and put his arm around Mama, but she said everything was all nght and began to clear the table. It wasn't until we were cating Mama's bottled peaches for dessert that I remembered the fourlayer wiggily cake. "Wie heissen Sie?" Papa interrupted my thoughts. Anna barely had time to tell us her name before she doubled up in a spasm of coughing. "Marjorie and I can get her to bed," Mama said quictly. "You must get Dr. Williams, John. 'This is nO common cough." Dr. Williams responded to calls at our house with alacrky. Mama's hospitality included his favorite — homemade ice cream. But there was no dasher for us to lick on this visit. We crowded at the door while Dr. Williams peered into Anna's throat. "The membrane is there, all right." He washed his hands carefully in the basin while Mama got Anna back to bed. "Tl ride back into town for anttoxin for all of you." Dr. Willams pulled down his vest and struggled with his coat. He avoided Papa's eyes and turned to pick up his black bag. SUMMER'S GRACE "Antitoxin?" Mama said in the doorway. "That German girl you've befricnded " I'd never heard Dr. Williams speak so gruffly. Not even once when Almy swallowed a bottle of pills in his office, and he put his finger down her throat to bring them back. She'd hung on with her teeth worse than Jake with Mama's slipper. Dr. Williams cleared his throat again, "She's got diphtheria, Edith." Quarantine became stifling. Mama slipped in and out of Anna's room, but that part of the house was forbidden to the rest of us. Sometimes we sneaked into the parlor and pulled back the lace curtain and examined the back of the cardboard sign that kept everyone away. It seemed cven the road at the end of the lane was avoided, and after the glory palled, we spent hours pitying ourselves as outcasts. Having our shoulders stuck with necdles was of little moment if you couldn't describe the ordeal to anyone. "T want Mama," Almy began to cry on the lawn. Marjorie hushed her, and Almy rubbed her eyes and dozed off with her hand under her cheek. "She must be hot. See how red her face is," I said to Marjorie. Marjorie laid her hand against Almy's round forehead where her brown hair had dampened into funny points. Almy grumbled and moaned in her sleep and pulled a fat knee toward her chest. "You better get Mama, Maudie." I jumped up the steps two at a time and ran into the kitchen. The whole house smelled like sickness. Mama was standing by the cupboard, and she looked at me with 21 asmile. "The worst is over, Maud. Run and tell Papa. Anna just ate a whole bowl of soup." "Mama.' Her face was so tired and happy all together. "Mama, Marjorie wants you to come feel Almy. She's so hot, and all she wants to do is lic down." I couldn't stand to look at. Mama, the happiness died out so quickly. It was like flying, she went so fast to Almy. I was sent for Papa in the pasture. Papa ran all the way back with me behind. I could hear the breath in his throat like an accompaniment to the swoosh-thud of his high heavy shoes. HREE nights in a row Dr. Wilhams came out in his brand new Ford car. Once I caught a glimpse of Almy held high on a pillow, her face dark from coughing. We lay under the sheets listening. Sometimes Mama _ lay down beside Almy, and Papa would watch. But the coughing would get bad, and then they both would get up. "Edith, Edith," Dr. Williams would say gruffly. "You have to get some rest, or you'll die yourself." "I won't give her up,' Mama said. > Anna wore Mama's wrapper and worked in our kitchen. She made bread and fried strips of ham for breakfast. It was Anna who noticed the first flag at the end of the lane. It was a stick with a white rag tied to it. Marjorie and I brought back the basket beside it. That night we ate Mrs. Snell's best poundcake. Mama didn't want any dinner, but she took in the new rag doll to Almy. Almy smiled and went to sleep with it under her cheek. She 22 slept with that doll until she was better, and Papa had to burn everything. But it was that night when Mama hadn't felt like eating that she took sick with diphtheria. Anna helped, but Papa was like a scarecrow. His beard grew until it scared Almy and made her cry. 'Then he scraped it off with his ears cocked always toward Mama's room. The flag was there the next day and the next. One day we found a bundle of clean dish towels nicely embroidered, wrapped in brown paper; another, there were cookies in a shoe box and a bundle of clean rags. A little salt bag filled with dried apricots appeared, and often there were homemade loaves of bread and rolls. Once we found a new dressed chicken wrapped in many folds of newspaper. We carried it all home to Anna who accepted it and served it. Papa took in some of the gifts to Mama. <A newly made apron, a fresh blue nightgown. But Mama would turn her head away and the tears would come. "I've brought this on us all, John. It's my foolish doing...." Papa would close the door, but his voice carried through the transom above. "Nonsense. You were doing your Christian duty. Edith, Edith!" She had begun to choke. "My love, Edith. Heaven help us! My Edith!" We shut our doors and cried into the pillows. Almy was well enough to be carricd to the kitchen by Anna. Her brown cheeks seemed pale, and she scolded us when we didn't get things for her promptly. "She won't be so cross when she gets her full strength back," Papa promised us, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1960 so we spoiled her and fetched her things and listened for Mama. HE summer was almost over before they took down the sign. Dr. Williams sat by Mama on the back porch and took her pulse. Papa had missed much time in the fields, but the neighbors had hauled in the hay and harvested the wheat. "You've got to get interested in things again, Edith. Accept the miracle of Almy and you being alive, not to exclude Anna, also." The tears began to run down Mama's cheeks. She pulled her blanket about her knees. I broke off a hollyhock by the back step and fastened the skirt on a stick doll for Almy. "Crying's natural, Edith. You're still mighty weak. But the sooner you can accept what's in the past and begin living in the future, then the strength will come back." Anna brought Mama her warm milk. And Mama shook her head, crying silently all the while. Anna got a spoon and fed the milk to Mama. The wind was cold, and there was a spattering of orange leaves already on the lawn. In the dark I put my arms around Papa and held him when he came to kiss us good night. "When will things be the same as before, Papa?" I whispered to the dark. For a long time there was no sound in the room. 'Then Papa stirred on the edge of the bed. "I don't know, Maudie. Your Mama did a Christian deed, to her thinking, and the punishment exceeded all that a devil might imagine. She's lost touch with the rhythm of living, and we have to give her time, SUMMER'S GRACE I guess " He sighed and fell silent. I fell asleep before he left the room. Anna never did go to work for Herman Hergesheimer. "Nein, nein," she said vigorously. "Ich will bei ihr bleiben!" She would not leave Mama. Besides, there was Ludwig, Papa's hired man who was going to buy a small farm of his own. His cap was set for Anna, and if the time ever came when Mama didn't need her, she thought she would make do with Ludwig. But until that time came, he need not bother her. NNA made us aprons for school. Autumn was really here, then, and but one last day remained before the long wagon rides to school began. We walked around the yard feeling lonesome. Ludwig walked up to the back lawn and stretched out. We peered into his face. "Dosebleed...." he said, wiping at his face. We ran into the house and wet one of Mama's best dish towels. "Anna!" we shricked. Mama lay on the couch in the kitchen that Papa had fixed for her. '"Anna's gone into town for more goods for Marjorie's dress. What is it?" 23 We told her about Ludwig and all the blood. She wrapped her shawl around her shoulders and followed us to the lawn. Ludwig looked very bloody and _ pitiful. "Give me the towel, Maud." Mama put the cold towel on his forehead and sent us to chip a piece of ice from the icebox. When we came back, Mama was scolding Ludwig. "So much blood, Ludwig. What is the cause of all this?" "It's bleeding from the heart maybe," said Ludwig. Mama gave him a sharp glance, and sent us in for more cloths though anyone could see the nosebleed was _ practically over. When we came back, Mama and Ludwig were talking about Anna. Mama kept saying, "But nobody told me a thing, not a thing." She invited Ludwig to dinner. "We'll have it late so you'll have plenty of time to go home and dress up." Ludwig smiled and smiled. "Tl make a wiggily cake for dinner,' Mama said as much to herself as to us. "You girls can do the fetching, and I'll do the stirring. That is," now she really looked at us, "if I haven't forgotten how." We smiled and smiled at her, just like Ludwig. <—>- Deone R.

Each day is set in its intricate design of former days and future time, and never can one day be reckoned as an island in the sea of continuity. One of the greatest blessings of the gospel is the assurance it gives of our place in the everlasting sequence of our far-reaching privileges and responsibilities. With full hearts, we rejoice in the New Year, believing, "Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all the generations" (Psalm go:1). In this setting, we think of the days of a woman's life upon the earth — and afterwards — the roles in which she participates, her interests and her development in each succeeding phase of the periods of time which are given to her. First, she is a daughter in her mother's home; then, if she is blessed with a companion, she becomes a wife, a daughter-in-law, a mother; finally, she will be a mother-in-law, and a _— grandmother. Through this cycle of days she will Page 28 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter also be a participant in the work of the Church and in community activities. And through all of these experiences, a woman learns about life from the vantage point of each of her "seven ages." In the course of this development, she acquires a measure of wisdom, sympathy, serenity, and a realization of her destiny in the Heavenly Father's eternal plan. [Each age yields to her experiences which gleam in splendor above all trials and disappointments, for it has been said of earth and earth life "The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold" (Job 28:6). The girl in her mother's home receives training and impressions that will determine the course of her life. She will always remember the shelter of the home walls, the lighted windows, her mother's face, the tireless hands sewing a dress for a girl child, the table set for the evening meal, the prayers that united the family in love and responsibility. And though partings inevitably came and illness, and, perhaps, hard times assailed the home, still there came to the daughter a strength of courage and a feeling of lifetime security that would companion her forever. The young wife in her new home might perhaps say to herself, this is a new unit in the kingdom of EDITORIAL earth, and in the kingdom of the Heavenly Father. Here are two people, strangers in many ways, coming from different homes, to merge together, each one bringing the past to build into a new unit, with the aura of youth and strength — so the young wife builds. The wife and her mother-in-law, whatever may be the differences in personality, have much to bring them close together. 'Vhey have a shared devotion to the son who is now a husband, and together they will love the grandchildren, enlarging the unit of the family with a new perspective and new companionship To the voung wife, the coming of a child seems to be a miracle. And so it is, for the Heavenly Father has given a spirit to tabernacle upon the carth, and the child, in his innocence, scems to be remembering his former home, even as he explores the wonders of carth. The mother, then, secs places and people through young eyes, as if a new portrait were being designed upon a white canvas, all impressions webbed in wondcr and beauty. The mother feels herself a part of all creation — a kinship with sunlight and flowers, and far habitations, having a wide love for children everywhere and a yearning to in- 29 crease the welfare and opportunities of all children. When a daughter or son marries, a woman again meets a stranger, certainly a stranger at first, and the circle of the family is at the same time diminished and_ enlarged. New adjustments come for older mothers, and there is a desire for greater understanding and for opportunities that will give wisdom and happiness in the circle of the growing family. One woman said, as her grandchildren grew like flowers around her, "Now [ am living in the perennial garden, and I have learned to receive with greater rejoicing the association with children, who are really the buds and blossoms of the world." 'This heightened sensitivity to companionship with young spirits seems to be onc of the greatest blessings realized by grandmothers, as they see the cycle of life thus made strong and everlasting. Grandchildren bring gifts from the faraway country of childhood. Thus are the ages of a woman combined into a cycle of increasing wisdom, expanding sympathies, and a widened appreciation of the gift of life and time — the gift of years, and always the New Year, and the eternal horizon. —V.

Page 31 32 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1960 Should untruthfulness creep into our lives it is likely to come first in faint disguise: in exaggeration; in concealment of some pertinent facts when people have a right to believe that what we say is the whole truth and nothing but the truth; in pretending that we agree with somcone else's statement when he expresses an idea or an opinion which is contrary to our own; in refraining from speaking up in defense of a person or a cause when we know we ought to do so; in making promises which we do not intend to keep. Only after we have grown callous to some of these milder forms of indirect deceit are we likely to tell deliberate falsehoods. Most people are innocent of intentional and outright deception. Young men and young women: how valiant are you to defend the truth? Do you stand up to the careless opinions and irresponsible claims which are so often expressed when young people engage in casual talk? How careful are you in expressing your own opinions and in sticking to facts in your own speech?

Prevent Crippling Diseases Basil O' Connor President, The National Foundation OU and the March of Dimes — that's the combination that produced the polio vaccine. 'That combination — you and the new March of Dimes — can do it again. The new March of Dimes is tackling birth defects, arthritis, and polio. Medical surveys show that one out of sixteen American babies is born defective. You can do something to stop it. Arthritis is America's No. 1 crippling disease — the enemy of millions, both adults and children. Old and new epidemics of polio have left 50,000 in need of March of Dimes care. The National Foundation, supported by the March of Dimes, leads in medical research to prevent crippling disease, in medical care to prevent disease crippling, and in professional education to train disease fighters. National Foundation scholarships train hands and minds to prevent the tragedy of crippling diseases. An army of volunteers will conduct the new March of Dimes in January 1960. They know the anguish that birth defects bring families; they know that arthritis and the rheumatic diseases strike millions, including children. 'They know that in 1959 polio erupted in terrifying epidemics and that polio still cripples. 'They also know that a nationally co-ordinated research program, accompanied by patient aid and the training of more medical personnel, is the only hope of checking these three cripplers, the only way of bringing hope to their victims. Help prevent crippling diseases. Join the new March of Dimes. OP J Could Tot Cry Gladys Hesser Burnham I could not cry the day you left me standing Unprepared for this, our last farewell.

Carolyn Hayes watched curiously out the window. "Honestly, they're always getting something new. Why only last month they got a new car, and the month before that." Ted Hayes put his arm affectionately around his wife. "Now, dear, we're not interested in what the Andrews get new. After all, they don't have any children to buy for, and we have three to take care of. 'They can afford things like that." Carolyn turned dark, intent eyes upon Ted. "Really, Ted, I don't mean to be envious, but I can't help but admire the nice things that Barbara and Chris Andrews have. Why Barbara even has a_ dishwasher." "But just think, Mrs. Hayes, you have three dish wipers and one potential one. What more could you ask for?" 'Ted teased in his good natured way. Ted, with his clean-cut appearance, his blonde curly hair, and his appealing blue eyes, could always make Carolyn smile. He had a way about him that would make the world seem rosy and bright, even on a rainy day. "Td like to see the time that you or the children finish the job of wiping the dishes for me." Carolyn laughed. "At least, I know that you have good intentions." Carolyn finally got the twins, Jimmy and Jenny, ready for school. They had just walked out the door when the baby, Cathy, started to Page 36 cry. "Oh, Cathy, you're supposed to sleep right now so Mommy can get her washing done." Carolyn sighed. ""I can see that this is going to be one of those days." After several unsuccessful _attempts, Carolyn finally finished the washing, then she made the beds and did the breakfast dishes. She worked through the lunch hour, and by the time the nine-year-old twins came home from school, Carolyn was exhausted. "I really should iron a few of those pieces before [I start dinner, but I'm just too tired." "Mother," Jimmy called from the living room. "Mrs. Andrews is here to see you." Oh, no, thought Carolyn, and I look so untidy. Barbara Andrews sat across from Carolyn and chatted to her about their new living-room set, and the trip that she and Chris planned to take to New York. Carolyn listened with excitement. If only she and Ted could take a trip like that, but they could never afford it. Besides, they wouldn't have anyone with whom to leave the children. "Oh, Barbara, it all sounds so wonderful. Why I've never hardly been out of the State, let alone to New York," Carolyn said. Barbara was her usual, wellgroomed self. "I am excited about it, Carolyn. Of course we always take a vacation every summer. Why, it just wouldn't seem right, if we didn't." Carolyn felt even more conspicuous in her soiled blue cotton dress, with her dark hair disheveled. MORE PRECIOUS THAN RICHES Barbara was trim and neat in a fresh cotton skirt and blouse, and her blonde hair was beautifully combed. "Well, I really must be running. Pm meeting Chris for dinner in town tonight, and then we're going to take in a show. Do come over and see my new furniture, Carolyn." THE thought of a show sounded relaxing to Carolyn, and when Ted came home, she suggested that they go. "It's fine with me, honey," Ted replied. "We can all go to a drivein. As it turned out, Carolyn wished that they had stayed home. Cathy wouldn't go to sleep, and the twins kept bouncing around in the back seat of the car. Every few minutes they had to have some popcorn, and then some candy, and then — "a drink of water, please, Daddy." Carolyn did take note of the beautiful moon that night, and her thoughts went back to the days when she and Ted were courting. The next thing she remembered the show was over, and Ted was taking the speaker out of the car. "Ted, I've been to sleep; why didn't you awaken me?" Carolyn asked. "You were sleeping so peacefully that I just didn't have the heart." Ted winked at Carolyn. The next day started out the same way for Carolyn, and she didn't have a spare minute to visit with Barbara. Suddenly, it occurred to Carolyn that Cathy's second birthday came the end of the week. "We'll have to have a little family party," she mused. When the twins came home from school, Carolyn told them of her plans, and they eagerly helped her plan the occasion, 37 The night of the party finally arrived, and little Cathy was proud and happy. She laughed and talked and tried to blow out the candles on the cake which Carolyn had taken so much time decorating. Carolyn looked around at the happy, laughing faces of her little family, and she knew that every moment of exhausting work was worth it. What would she ever do without them? 'hey were more precious than riches. Just then a knock came to the door, and when Carolyn answered it, Barbara stood before her. Barbara looked around at the gaily decorated table, at the cake with its two single candles and one to grow on, and at the brightly wrapped presents on the table. "Oh, Pm sorry, Carolyn, I didn't know that you were having a party. It's just that I." There were tears in her eyes as she spoke. "I get so lonesome when Chris isn't there. Oh, Carolyn, you have so very much to be thankful for." Carolyn thought with amazement, all this time I have been admiring her beautiful things, she has been wanting what I have. She took Barbara by the arm and led her into the dining room. "Im so happy that you came, Barbara. You're just in time to have some cake and ice cream with us. Little Cathy will be delighted, too. She loves visitors." As Carolyn set a place for Barbara, she turned toward 'Ted and gave him a radiant smile that said, "Thank you for all the happiness that we have together." Ted, in turn, wondered what he had done to deserve such a lovely, glowing smile from his beautiful wife, Rosella Yenkins Makes Quilts and Rugs ae ae Cora Brown Jenkins, Gooding, Idaho, makes quilts, rugs, and many doilies, pot holders, dolls, and other items for home beautification and for gifts.

Todd CHAPTER 4 Synopsis: Lynn Marlow, a dress designer, who lives in Chicago and is engaged to David Talbot, returns to Springdale, her home town, to visit her Aunt Polly, and to find out if she has really forgotten her early love for Johnny Spencer. He had married a Southern girl and she had died, leaving two children. On her way to her aunt's home, Lynn meets Johnny's children, but she delays going to see Johnny. T' was quite natural that her feet | should turn to the willow path. Long ago, when the path was new, she had gone there to think. If she had done something wrong and Aunt Polly had reprimanded her, if she had quarreled with Johnny, or if anything had happened that wasn't right, she had come here in the willows and found her Balm of Gilead. Now she walked in the ferns and willow leaves until she came to the stump lying like a hound dog by the path. And she sat down on it and took off her shoes and dipped her feet into the cool water. In the leaves near something caught her eye. It was the pocket knife, the open blade shining up at her through the leaves. Her heart began a peculiar thumping. That knife belonged to Johnny's boy. He had given it to her to make the whistle that she had never finished. She picked it up thoughtfully. 'Then, reaching up, she snipped off the willow branch hanging low over her head. The blade slid quite easily through the tender limb, and in a short time she was bark from her pounding the whistle. It was funny how she could temember just the right things to do after so many years. Just how deep to make the groove, just where to cut the slit, and then the taste of the sap as she wet the bare whistle in her mouth to make the bark slide on easily. She was eager as a child as she put the whistle to her lips. It had always been fun to try a new whistle. 'There were so many pitches. It blew a high shrill note that made her start a little so that she looked squarely into the pair of eyes peeking furtively through the willow clump. She knew those eyes, too. She would never question them again. 'They were Johnny's eyes, in Johnny's son's face. E knew immediately that she had seen him, but he stayed defiantly in the willows. "I want my knife," he said. Lynn had regained her composure now. "Of course you may have it," she said "but you must come and get it." He came a few steps out of the willows, and Lynn looked behind him, expecting to see the little girl. "Where is your sister?" "None of your business," he said, without offering to come further. She raised her eyebrows. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you angry." "What'd you run away for when you promised to make us a whistle?" Page 39 40 Oh, so that was it! "Tm sorry," she said again. "It was very foolish of me to run away. Would you believe me if I told you I was afraid of something when I ran away?" "There's nothing in these willows to get you,' he said. He was still eyeing her up and down. "Oh, I'm sure of that,' Lynn said very seriously. "But — well, if you had something that made you very, very unhappy and you lost it, and then suddenly found it, do you think you might run away before it hurt you all over again?" He puckered his forehead into a scowl. "You don't talk plain," he said. She laughed then. "TI suppose I don't." She looked down into her hand at the whistle. "Did you hear my whistle?" "Sure, [ heard it. I was standing right there. I watched you make it." "Oh, did you! I thought you just came out of nowhere." "That's silly. Nobody comes out of nowhere." She laughed again. "T guess they don't." He still stood in the same place. "Would you like the whistle?" He thought a minute. "Tl give it to Lindy," he said and came forward. Lindy! Johnny had named his little girl Lindy! Like a fast moving drama, there rushed before her a night along the willow path, with Johnny's arms around her. She could see vividly the flower in his buttonhole. She could even smell the violets in her hair. And sharp and clear a voice tender, sweet, "All! Our little girls we will name Lindy." She sat stupified while he took RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1960 the whistle she held in her hand. "I want my knife, too," he said. "Oh, of course. Excuse me." She reached for the knife that was lying on the stump beside her. "Does Lindy like whistles?" "Course she does." Lynn was quite calm now. "I suppose all boys and girls like whistles." "Lindy is asleep," Peter volunteered now, as though to make up for his rudeness awhile ago. "Who who stays with her when she's asleep?" Lynn was unconsciously twisting the leaves from a willow branch. "Sometimes I do. Sometimes she gets up and plays by herself." A slight frown knit her forehead. "How old is Lindy?" she asked. "She's four, and she knows a lot," he announced nonchalantly. Lynn looked at the boy thoughtfully. He talked like a grown-up. "How old are you, Peter?" she asked. "Nearly six. Pll soon be as big as my dad," he said. "Do you and Lindy with your father?" "Course we do," Peter answered, "cause our mother died." He looked at her then as though there was a decision forming in his mind. "You can see our house from here," he said, pointing to it across the meadow. "Yes, I see," she said, following his finger. "Why don't you come and see it?" She caught her breath. And then David's words—"Promise me you will see Johnny," he had said. Lynn sighed. If she must see Johnny, perhaps she must also see his house. The house by live alone, THE NEW DAY the mill — wan't that part of it, too? "{ — IJ think I would like to." They stood looking at each other. "Now?" she asked. "Sure." T was some far-fetched dream — walking down the path through the clover meadow with a _ boy whose eyes belonged to a lost love, to a house that by nghts was hers, where a little girl who might have been her baby lay asleep, whose leading footsteps brought her nearer and nearer to some knot of confused circumstances she could not face; and yet could not avoid. It was all crazy — some silly hallucination from which she must presently awaken. She didn't belong here anyway. She belonged with David on a warm green hillside. Her mind rambled wildly, inventing and entangling. The breeze was soft and sweet with scented clover bloom, or lilac or pussy willow or birds' songs, or chirping crickets or — on and on it went, manufacturing incoherent phrases of nonsense, like a jumbled picture puzzle where you searched endlessly without ever finding a piece that would fit. And all the times she had cried in the night, all the walks in the willow path, all the dress designs she had fashioned, all the rides with David through the forest preserves were all mixed together. "That's the monkey tree." Lynn came back from her confused mental soliloquy. Peter was pointing to a gnarled old juniper tree standing like a half-naked giant with fingers and toes stretching in all directions. "Monkey tree?" she repeated, 41 hardly knowing what she said. "Sure. My Dad calls it that because it would be such a good tree for monkeys. I play I'm a monkey when I climb it." Lynn laughed then, a_ little. "Does Lindy climb the tree, too?'' It was a silly thing to ask. But everything was unreal anyway. "Aw, gee, no. Girls can't climb trees. Anyway, she's too little. She'd fall and break something." "Yes, of course,' Lynn agreed. "The turkey nest is over that way on the other side of the strawberries. Ill show it to you after we see the house." YNN looked at the house then that sat at the top of the slope which ran down and lost itself in the millpond. It was a small white house with a sun porch and a path that curled round the hill like an invitation. 'There was a chimney, too, a rock chimney with stones laid just so in rows of red mortar. The roof, cool and green, spread wide eaves far enough to shade a summer afternoon to tranquility. And there was a window with a pink ruffled curtain. Lynn had an unquenchable desire to see inside the house. She wanted to know if there was a pink cupboard with blue teacups and a planter box where you could put bright geraniums. She hurried her footsteps toward the door, and stopped as suddenly. What will I do if Johnny is there? Even if I have promised that I must see him, would he want to see me? And anyway, this house belonged to a girl with dark hair from the South. The door opened slowly, and she looked down into the frightened 42 eyes of the little girl. The tot started as if she might run and then she caught sight of Peter behind Lynn and ran crying to him and hanging on to his shirt. "Aw, shucks, Lindy, you don't have to be afraid. I asked her to come and see whcre we live." The child turned her head sideways and peered at Lynn through tear-filled eyes, and then she hid her face in the plaid shirt. "Look, Lindy," Peter said with big brother superiority, "she made you a whistle." Lindy unburied her face. In a second or two she reached her chubby hand forward for the whistle, which she held silently. "Blow it, dear," Lynn said, smiling. Hesitantly Lindy put the whistle to her lips, but she didn't blow it. She just looked from Peter to Lynn and back again. "Aw, why don't you blow it?" Peter said. Then she blew, weakly at first and then loudly. "See, I told you it'd blow," Peter said. Lynn looked from the little girl into the room. And it was filled with Johnny from the trophy on the mantel that he had won when he was captain of the basketball team to his slippers sitting by the fireplace. 'There was a planter box, too. But it had no geraniums in it. That would have to be from a woman, "T 'want a drink," Lindy. Said. "T'm thoisty." Lynn brought herself back to the children. "TI get you a drink." In the kitchen she found the pink RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1960 cupboard and a row of blue plates and a shelf of spices and a line of blue teacups hanging on hooks. She took one down and filled it with water from the sink. "Here, Lindy," she said. Lindy took the cup and drank heartily. "Fank vou," she said, and Lynn tried to swallow the lump in her throat. Impulsively she leaned down and lifted the httle girl in her arms. "You are a darling," she said. "T am a buttonhook." "That's what Dad calls her," Peter explained. Lynn laughed and hugged the child. As she did so her eyes found the rocking chair by the fireplace, and a strange urge tugged at her. This is unreal, she thought, as she sat in the chair with the child in her lap. But everything is unreal. She began rocking back and forth while the little girl cuddled in her arms. The chair was turned toward the door, and she could see down the path that wound away into the junipers. And up the hill she could see Aunt Polly's. Aunt Polly was there making rhubarb pies. She looked at the child lying quietly in her arms. 'Then some faint sound or intuition broke the spell and she looked up. Johnny was staring at her. Johnny, with his wide gray eyes, one lock of his dark hair falling over his forehead. Even in the first split second she saw him, she knew the years had hung a weariness about him. He was standing there in the door, and she thought she could never forget his face.

Lyman (Continued from page 5) Central Chorus. 'This has been a strength to Relief Society and brought happiness and development to thousands of Relief Socicty sisters whose sweet voices have inspired us and brought a spirit of worship into our meetings. The division of Relief Society work with which Sister Lyman seems to be most intimately identified, however, in the minds of most people who know of her work, is the founding, in 1919, and the nurturing and development of the Relief Society Social Service and Child Welfare Department, under the presidency of Sister Emmeline B. Wells, and upon advice of President Joseph F. Smith. This department continues today an extremely important division of Relief Society work, offering to children and others standardized case work services which require license. Sister Lyman's work in the field of social welfare has not been confined to the Church. She has extended it nationally and even internationally. She credits her first interest in social work to a summer class in sociology which she took at the University of Chicago, at which time she also did volunteer social work with the Chicago Charities, which brought her into contact with Hull House, the famous Chicago settlement house established by one of the nation's great social workers, Jane Addams. She also took a special course, in 1917, in family welfare work in Colorado, which, she maintained, further stimulated her and created in her a strong desire to participate fully in social welfare, utilizing the highest standard of practices. She maintained that this schooling in Colorado provided her with basic preparation for her later work. Wa$th due respect to this, it is my personal opimion that Sister Lyman would have been a social worker and a good one, anyway, because of her love for and understanding of people and because of her innate desire to help her fellowmen. E have always considered Sister Lyman as a link which bound the present to the beginnings of Relief Society. She was called to the General Board during the presidency of Bathsheba W. Smith, who was the youngest among the eighteen original members, and the fourth General President of Relief Society. Sister Lyman often recalled visits to Pleasant Grove, when she was a child, of Sister Eliza R. Snow and Sister Zina D. H. Young. She was familiar with the character and work of these two great women leaders, the second and third Presidents of Relief Society. She served under the leadership of Sister Emmeline B. Wells, Clarissa S. Williams, Louise Y. Robison, the fifth, sixth, and seventh General Presidents respectively. She herself became the eighth General President. Today, as the ninth General President, I wish to express my sincere appreciation for the opportunities and training which she gave me during the three years I acted as her Counselor in the General Presidency, and prior to that as Editor of The Relief Society Magazine and as PRESIDENT AMY BROWN LYMAN a member of the General Board. I feel greatly indebted to her for all she did for me that has been so helpful to me in the position I now hold. This connection of Sister Lyman with all these leaders is of interest. It has made her a veritable treasure house of information. With her remarkable memory, inimitable speaking style, and her keen sense of humor, an hour with her, listening to her tell interesting, intimate, unrecorded bits in the history of Relief Society, was both informative and delightful. Sister Lyman loved history. A good. Record keeper and _ historian herself, she taught others of us the values and delights of these activities. Relief Society has benefited from this. As a Relief Society representative, Sister Lyman brought credit to the society through her activities in the National Council of Women of the United States. She was: recording secretary, auditor, and Third Vice President of the Council, and represented the Council three times as a delegate to the International Council of Women meetings—once in. 'Washington, D. C., once in Yugoslavia, and once in Scotland. At a recent National Council of Women biennial meeting held in New York City, a former president of the Council, Dr. Valeria H. Parker, spoke to me in high esteem of Mrs. Lyman's work in the Council and sent with me a message of love and appreciation to Sister Lyman. Her own years of presidency were war years, characterized by disturbed times. 'lhe work had to be conducted under difficult, trying, and exceptional circumstances. The 47 centennial observance, which fittingly came during her term of presidency, and into which she had put so much of her heart, had to be greatly curtailed. But, with characteristic courage, she met the situation. With wisdom, skill, and obedience to those presiding over her, she turned what might have been an extremely disappointing occasion to the sisters of the Church into one long to be remembered for its sweetness, simplicity, impressiveness, and enduring value. Sister Lyman has not confined her work to Relief Society. She has been interested in public affairs and has been a civic leader of distinction among women. Among her important civic activities was membership in the Utah State House of Representatives. She served on many local and State welfare boards, notably the Utah State 'Training School. She was on the Governor's committee of five to select a site for this institution and served on its board for many years. She was one of nine persons appointed as a committee on the organization of the Utah State Conference of Social Work. It was my privilege to be with her at the recent annual meeting of this organization when she was honored for her great work in behalf of the organization, as well as for her contributions to social work, generally, throughout the State. Sister Lyman traveled widely, spreading her influence wherever she went. From 1936-1938 she presided over the women's organizations of the European Mission. She referred to this work "as a joy, a satisfaction, and an_ inspiration throughout." It is to be expected that a person 48 of Sister Lyman's abilities and scope of activities would receive special honors. Among many such honors which came to her were the Brigham Young University Distinguished Alumnus Award and the election by the Salt Lake City Council of Women to its Hall of Fame. As I knew Sister Lyman believe I knew her well) she could be described very much as she described her own mother — "forceful, dynamic, and efficient; wise, far-seeing, and of good judgment. She was a woman's woman." She was a good speaker and wrote with a gifted pen. Her messages were always well organized and _ presented with clanty and conviction. Her autobiography "In Retrospect" delightfully preserves her own history and gives interesting accounts of incidents related to the history of Relief Society. She was an intellectual woman — a smart woman I would say — a prodigious worker, a good teacher, a great leader, and a choice friend. And I would add that she was a very pretty woman with a rare personal charm. In her autobiography, there is inscribed on the flyleaf her simple and sincere testimony of the truthfulness of the gospel and its meaning in her life. It reads: (and I RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1960 I am grateful for the Gospel and especially for my testimony of its truthfulness. This testimony has been my anchor and my stay, my satisfaction in time of joy and gladness, my comfort in time of sorrow and discouragement. Sister Lyman's admirers are legion. In many parts of the world today women are noting her passing and mourn with us. Her friendship and life will be a cherished mcmory. In the book of Revelation we are told:... Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them (Revelation 14:13). Sister Lyman's work will follow her. May her family be blessed through their beautiful memories of her abundant and useful life. May the love she has shown them and their own tender, loving miunistrations to her return to bless and comfort them. I can think of no sweeter ending to this life for a mother than to leave it enfolded in the arms of her only daughter. His was Sister Lyman's privilege and Margaret's blessing. May her loved ones be sustained in their hour of sorrow and always in the knowledge that she lives eternally. LESS N DEPARTMENT Sheology—Tthe Doctrine and Covenants Lesson 23—A Trial of Faith Elder Roy W. Doxey (Text: The Doctrine and Covenants, Sections 35, 39, and 40) For Tuesday, April 5, 1960 Objective: To understand that only those who live the gospel will reccive eternal life. HE persons to whom the revelations comprising this lesson were addressed were formerly munisters in the "Christian" clergy. One of these we were introduced to in the last lesson. Sidney Rigdon, Forerunner Sidney Rigdon was at one time in the Reformed Baptist Church and later one of the leaders in the "Disciples of Christ" Church in Ohio, from which so many converts came, beginning in 1830. When Sidney Rigdon and Edward Parttidgc, also a former member of the latter organization and a convert to the gospel of Jesus Christ, visited the Prophet Joseph Smith in December 1830, a revelation was received in which some interesting thoughts are given concerning Brother Rigdon. Behold, verily, verily, I say unto my servant Sidney, I have looked upon thee and thy works. I have heard thy prayers, and prepared thee for a greater work. Thou art blessed, for thou shalt do great things. Behold thou wast sent forth, even as John, to prepare the way before me, and before Elijah which should come, and thou knewest it not. Thou didst baptize by water unto repentance, but they received not the Holy Ghost; But now I give unto thee a commandment, that thou shalt baptize by water, and they shall receive the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, even as the apostles of old (D & C 35:3-6). As this revelation points out, there was a considerable difference between the work performed by Sidney Rigdon as one who was not a member of the true Church of Jesus Christ and the service to which he was being called. Although he baptized with water unto repentance, that baptism was not effective for salvation; for "... They received not the Holy Ghost." It is necesPage 49 50 sary for salvation that one receive both baptisms, water and _ spirit, which, in reality, are only one baptism. (See John 3:5; Eph. 4:5.) When Nephi, by vision, learned the reasons for Jesus' being baptized and the necessity of teaching the Nephites (and us) the place of baptism in the plan of salvation, he counseled: Wherefore, do the things which I have told you I have seen that your Lord and your Redeemer should do; for, for this cause have they been shown unto me, that ye might know the gate by which ye should enter. For the gate by which ye should enter is repentance and baptism by water; and then cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost. (Italics, by author. ) And then are ye in this straight and narrow path which leads to eternal life; yea, ye have entered in by the gate (2 Nephi 31:17-18). In order for one to receive the remission of sins, it is essential that he receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost as well as water baptism. Preparation for Gospel Restoration In view of the Lord's statement that Sidney Rigdon was as John the Baptist in preparing for a greater work, may we consider that there were many others, who, at different periods, also prepared the way for the establishment of the true gospel on the earth? As Latter-day Saints we believe that when the time came for the restoration of the gospel in its fulness, everything was in readiness. The Lord had preserved this land of America that it might be the place where his latter-day work would be established. Book of Mormon prophets had seen in vision the time when this land "choice above all other lands" was being prepared. (See 2 Nephi 1:3-9; 10:10-14, 19; Ether 13:1-6.) RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1960 In Nephi's vision, the "man among the Gentiles' believed by us to be Columbus, who was separated from the seed of my brethren by the many waters..." (2 Nephi 13:12), was wrought upon by the Spirit of God to perform his mission of discovery. Other Gentiles were also to come to this land out of captivity, until a mighty Nation founded upon principles of freedom would be raised up under the providence of God. (See 1 Nephi 13:13-19.) In the meantime, other leaders were performing a work of preparation — a preparation of the minds of men whose descendants would benefit from their noble labors. 'The discovery of the printing press with the removal of the shackles of ignorance was a slow process, but, in time, it brought about conditions which permitted men to think for themselves. Religiously, men benefited from these improved conditions, but the gospel of Jesus Christ was not restored until full preparation had been made. President John 'Taylor places before us the attitude of Latter-day Saints in some of these matters. Who are we? The children of our Heavenly Father. Who are the world, as we sometimes denominate those that are not of our Church? The children of our Heavenly Father. Now outside the Gospel, outside of revelation, outside of any special communication from the Lord, all men, more or less, everywhere have certain claims upon their Heavenly Father, who is said to be the God and Father of the spirits of all flesh... And whenever and wherever there was no knowledge of life and immortality there was no Gospel. But outside of that there have been many good influences abroad in the world. Many LESSON: DEPARTMENT men in the different ages, who, in the midst of wickedness and corruption, have tried to stop the current of evil, have placed themselves in the catalogue of reformers.... The many reformers that existed in former ages have been men many of whom have been sincerely desirous to do the will of God, and to carry out His purposes, so far as they knew them. And then there are thousands and tens of thousands of honorable men living today in this nation, and other nations, who are honest and upright and virtuous, and who esteem correct principles and seek to be governed by them, so far as they know them. Men may be desirous to do nght; they may be good, honorable and conscientious; and then when we come to the judgment pertaining to these things we are told that all men will be judged according to the deeds done in the body, and according to the light and intelligence which thev possessed. I will take, for instance, the position of the reformers, going no further back than Luther and Melancthon; and then you may come to Calvin, Knox, Whitfield, Wesley, Fletcher, and many others; men who have been desirous in their day to benefit their fellow-men; who have proclaimed against vice, and advocated the practice of virtue, uprightness and the fear of God. But we all, who have contemplated these subjects, know that those men never did restore the Gospel as it was taught by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ; neither did they see or comprehend alike in biblical matters; they groped, as it were, in the dark with a portion of the Spirit of God. They sought to benefit their fellow-man but not having that union with God that the Gospel imparts, they were unable to arrive at just conclusions pertaining to those matters. Hence one introduced and taught one principle, and another introduced and taught another; and they were split up and divided, and the spirit of antagonism was found at times among them and with all their desires to do good, they did not, and could not restore the Gospel of the Son of God, and none among them were able to say, Thus saith the Lord. And that is the condition of the religious world to-day... (Journal of Discourses 23:369-371). 51 A Minister Makes a Covenant As we now turn our attention to another clergyman, James Covill, (See D & C 39), who had served in the Baptist ministry for about forty years, we are informed by the Prophet Joseph Smith that he came to him "... And covenanted with the Lord that he would obey any command that the Lord would give to him through me, as His servant w.." (D. H. C. 1:143). Sons and Daughters of God Several times in revelations we have studied, the Savior has made known the way we may become his sons and daughters. For example, Section 34 begins with "My son Orson " and later, after giving the reasons for this introduction, states: '"... Wherefore you are my son" (D&C 34:3). Why was this recent convert to the Church so addressed? Why was James Covill, a nonmember, told that Jesus Christ is the light and life of the world and that, in the meridian of time (the time of the earthly ministry of Jesus), Jesus was not received? But to as many as received me, gave I power to become my sons and even so will I give unto as many as will receive me, power to become my sons. And verily, verily, I say unto you, he that receiveth my gospel receiveth me; and he that receiveth not my gospel receiveth not me (D & C 39:4-5). The answer is the same for everyone who qualifies in the same way that Brother Pratt qualified, or as you have qualified as a daughter of the Lord. All who accept "'the only true and living church upon the face of the earth" become sons or daughters of the "Lord God." Jesus Christ, as your Redeemer, "so loved 52 the world that he gave his own life, that as many as would belicve might become the sons of God" (D & C 34:3). Christ is our Redeemer. Redemption means deliverance by means of ransom. There is a deliverance from guilt. (Eph. 1:7; Col. 1:14); from the power and dominance of sin, through the sanctifying influence of the Holy Spirit (1 Peter 1:18); and from death through the resurrection (Rom. 8:23). There is, finally, a deliverance from all evil (Eph. 1:14; 4:30; 1 Cor. 1:30; Titus 2:14). All this is the work of Christ, through obedience to the gospel (Doctrine and Covenants Commentary, Revised Edition, page 177). Jesus is our Savior when we accept him in the waters of baptism and by confirmation of the Holy Ghost. 'This is what James Covill is told as a nonmember. (See D & C 39:4-6.) Jesus' atonement for individual exaltation is of no force until the person completes his repentance through the ordinances of the gospel. (See'D & C 29:17; 42:1.) As we become the sons and daughters of Jesus, so also, he becomes our Father. (See Lesson 20, October 1959 issue of The Relief Society Magazine for discussion on this point.) Rich Rewards Promised James Covill, the clergyman, was informed that the Lord had looked upon him and his works and, at that time, his heart was right before him. (Sec D & C 39:7-8.) There had been times in the past, however, when the, things of the world had brought sorrow into Mr. Covill's life. Notice the important fact made known in verse 6 that if this man would accept Jesus as his Savior, the Holy Ghost, which he had not received, would give him the "peaceable things of the kingdom." RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1960 It would scem from the circumstances which brought this clergyman to the Prophet, that he was not at peace. 'There were unanswered questions and _ difficulties which had not been resolved in his mind. In applying this idea to us who are members of the kingdom, how may we reccive peace of mind? A function of the Holy Ghost is to give to the daughter of Jesus Christ a sense of security, peace, and joy. This satisfaction comes by having the influence of the Holy Spirit through living the laws of the gospel, just as James Covill was promised "... A blessing so great as you never have known" (D & C 39:10) by his adherence to the same laws. A greater work in teaching the fulness of the gospel than the work in which he had formerly engaged was before Covill, predicated upon his obedience. His contribution would be to assist in moving the kingdom forward that, eventually, Zion might come. (See D & C 39:11-13.) How many of us have before us this objective? Do our works make such contributions? Our forefathers were gathered from out of the world that they might eventually receive eternal life. Mr. Covill was promised that he could participate in this great undertaking of gathering Israel from the nations to "... Be gathered unto me [Jesus] in time and in eternity" (D & C 39:22). Those who are gathered are to look forth for the signs of the Lord's coming. As we continue steadfast in his work, our knowledge and testimony of him will increase. (See D & C 39:23.) The Rejection of a Covenant Notwithstanding that great blessings were promised James Covill LESSON DEPARTMENT upon his acceptance of the true gospel, he did not have sufficient faith in the Redeemer to accept his counsel. The day of his deliverance from the sorrows of the world was at hand (D & C 39:10), provided he would be obedient. But Covill returned to his former principles and people, and of him the Lord said: Behold, verily I say unto you, that the heart of my servant James Covill was right before me, for he covenanted with me that he would obey my word. And he received the word with gladness, but straightway Satan tempted him; and the fear of persecution and the cares of the world caused him to reject the word. Wherefore he broke my covenant, and it remaineth with me to do with him as seemeth me good. Amen (D & C 40:1-3). James Covill was a covenant breaker. It is apparent that his former weaknesses gained ascendancy over the gladness which came into his heart, and he succumbed to fear. It was a fear of persecution and the cares of the world. Unmindful of the beatitude of promised blessings to those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake (for their reward was to be an inheritance in the kingdom of heaven), Covill's actions were not motivated to this extent. (See Mt. 5:10-12.) The fear that he might not be able to provide for himself temporally, also was a factor in his rejection of the gospel Blessings Predicated Upon Obedience Judgment of all such individuals is in the hands of the Lord. There have been many in the world who have come to the threshold of the kingdom of God but who have succumbed to similar fears. Concerning such an one who was in the 53 same profession as James Covill, we have the comment of President Joseph F. Smith. An ordained minister in the "English Church' for fifty-five years wrote to his Latterday Saint relative that: I preach three sermons cvery week and execute other ministerial duties, but I never preach anything contrary to the doctrines of "Mormonism," not designedly but necessarily, because I sce the fundamentals of Holy Scripture arc the same as those restored by what pcople call "Mormonism." He then posed this question: What is to become of such as me, who believes this about you, and yet are tied and bound by circumstances such as mine? The President of the Church wrote: In answer to the question, "What is to become of such as me?" let it be said that every person will receive his just reward for the good he may do and for his every act. But Ict it be remembered that all blessings which we shall reccive, cither here or hereafter, must come to us as a result of our obedience to the laws of God upon which these blessings are predicated. Our friend will not be forgotten for the kindness he has extended to the work and the servants of the Lord, but will be remembered of Him and rewarded for his faith and for every good deed and word. But there are many blessings that result from obcying the ordinances of the gospel, and acknowledging the priesthood authorized by the Father and restored to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, that cannot be obtained, until the person is willing to comply with the ordinances and keep the commandments revealed in onr day for the salvation of mankind. 'The true searcher will see and understand this truth and act upon it, either in this world or in the world to come, and not until then, of course, may he claim all the blessings. The earlier he accepts, the earlicr will he obtain the blessings, and if he neglects to accept the laws, in this world, know- 54 ing them to be true, it is reasonable to suppose that disadvantages will result that will cause him deep regret (Improvement Era, November 1912, pp. 71-72). Unto Whom Much Is Given Much Is Required One is reminded of the truth given by the Lord when he said that ",.. Unto whom much is given much is required " (D&C 82:3) and as greater light is made known and as one sins against that light, greater condemnation results. 'This thought is pertinent: Ye call upon my name for revelations, and I give them unto you; and inasmuch as ye keep not my sayings, which I give unto you, ye become transgressors; and justice and judgment are the penalty which is affixed unto my law. Therefore, what I say unto one [I say unto all: Watch, for the adversary spreadeth his dominions, and darkness reigneth (D & C 82:4-5). In accordance with this thought, how many who have entered the kingdom of God have found that they were not deeply rooted in gospel teachings and faith in the Redeemer so that they succumbed to the fears of the world? Are any of us as the seeds in the parable of the sower where the word of God has not taken sufficient root, and "the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word," and seeds become barren? Or, on the other hand, are seeds sown on the "good ground" which beareth the fruit of the gospel in our lives? (See Mt. 13:18-23.) How many of us may fall away from the principles of the gospel because of fear of persecution? In the early part of the dispensation persecution was many times physRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1960 ical. 'Today, however, it may be, as it was then also, the tauntings of associates or "friends." The use of names having strong unChristian implications or inferences of overzealousness may be examples of a type of persecution which has mental or psychological effect. In common expression it may be expressed as "Don't be fanatical about your religion!" or "Why be so straight-laced?" Aside from the usual meaning of inflicting loss and injury, persecution means to harass, to pursue with persistent solicitations or to annoy. Additional Items From Section 35 Beginning with verse 7 of Section 35, we learn that by faith great things are to be manifest in the latter days, including the working of miracles. (See D & C 35:7-11.) In harmony with what has already been given in this lesson, the Lord makes known that those who do "good" in his sight, are "... Those who are ready to receive the fulness of my gospel " (D & C 35:12) and that those who constitute the "... Poor and the meek..." (D & C 35:15) of the earth " shall have the gospel preached unto them, and they shall be looking forth for the time of my coming, for it is mgh at hand" (D & C 35:15). (See D & C 35:12-18.) The faithful members of the kingdom of God will make contributions to the building of that kingdom and eventually "Zion shall rejoice upon the hills," probably having reference to the home of the saints in the West. (See D & C 35:19-24.) By the power of God, latter-day Israel will be saved in the Lord's kingdom, and all who belong to the LESSON DEPARTMENT Savior should lift up their hearts and be glad. (See D & C 35:25-27.) Questions for Discussion 1. What seems to be unusual about the revelation concerning Sidney Rigdon's activities?

(siting teacher ITlessages— Truths to Live By From The Doctrine and Covenants Message 23—"Govern Your House in Meekness, and Be Steadfast" (D & C 31:9) Christine H. Robinson For 'Tuesday, April 7, 1960 Objective: The virtues of mceekness and steadfastness applied in our lives and homes will result in an influence for good. HIS message focuses attention upon two virtues which can be employed with remarkable effect in developing our own characters and in guiding and directing the activities of others. 'These two virtues are meekness and steadfastness. Meekness is a quality frequently mentioned in the scriptures and described as a most desirable human trait. In fact, it is one of the few qualities which Jesus attributed unto himself. He said, "... For I am meek and lowly in heart " (Mt. 11:29). Meekness is sometimes confused with docility and lack of courage. Still, Moses, whom history proves to have been a man of strong character and outstanding courage, was described as "... Very meck, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth" (Num. 12:3). Actually the term meckness means, mild of temper, long-suffering, gentle, kind. Open-mindedness and teachableness are both facets of meekness. Wath these attributes it is easy to understand why the Savior declared, "Blessed are the meck: for they shall inhent the earth" (Mt. 5:5). Steadfastness denotes firmness, self - control, consistency, and staunchness. 'Those who are steadfast exhibit unfaltering determination in the face of adversity. Helen Adams Keller is one of the truly great women of all time. Much of her remarkable stature was achieved through the application of the virtues of meckness and stead- | we \ ¢ ' ~ ~ \s a ai \ 56 fastness both in her own development and through the efforts of her outstanding teacher. Due to a serious illness, Miss Keller lost her senses of sight and hearing before she was two years of age. Her parents, seeking to lighten the burden of her tragedy, sought the assistance of an able teacher, Mrs. Ann Sullivan Macy. This teacher applied the true meaning of meekness and steadfastness in educating and guiding the child. Through the application of these attributes a miracle was virtually performed. In a very few years Miss Keller learned to read braille, to write, and to acquire the difficult ability to speak without hearing. By the time she reached her teens, Miss Keller was as well educated as any normal child of her age. In due time, she graduated with honors from Radcliffe College and has since devoted her life to working with the blind and deaf of the world. In A RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1960 order to attain the high eminence which she now enjoys, Miss Keller, together with her great teacher Mrs. Macy, has consistently employed meekness, steadfastness, optimism, and faith. Through exercising these virtues, Helen Keller has inspired, stimulated, and encouraged millions of people in all walks of life throughout the world. If we would become a power for good and lead and direct our children and friends in a loving, helpful way, we must govern our homes and lives in meekness. We must strive to be steadfast and consistent in the application of right principles in all our activities. In our association with others, in and outside of the home, we should follow the admonition of the Savior, who said: No power or influence can or ought to be maintained... Only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned (D & C 121:41).

Larsen For Tuesday, April a 2, 1960 Objective: To show the importance of safe food care and proper preservation of stored food to healthful living. Historical Consideration ROM the very earliest of times man has been concerned with preservation of his food so that he might save the excess of the prosperous years for the famine of the lean years. He found that certain foods could be dried and saved for long periods of time. Later, he discovered that certain foods and LESSON DEPARTMENT chemicals were helpful in the preservation of other foods, such as sugar, vinegar, and salt. The adulteration of food dangerous to personal health caused laws to be passed which protect practically every type of foodstuff. In 1906, the United States passed the first Federal Food and Drug Control Act. In 1938 a much. Stronger Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was passed. 'The Government maintains large laboratories where foods are tested before they are sold. The kind and amount of coloring matter, and the kind and amount of preservatives are rigidly fixed by the Food and Drug Administration. Also, the law requires that when important ingredients, such as vitamins, minerals, and butter fat from milk, are removed from foods it must be clearly stated on the package. In general, the State and Federal laws against harmful adulteration are standard, so that the general public is well protected from dishonest practices. Preservation of Food and Proper Canning Procedures Foods may be preserved by canning, smoking, salting, drying, freezing, cooking, sugaring, and adding chemicals. Most of these methods of food preservation can be carried out in the home. However, preservation of food by adding chemicals can be very dangerous and harmful, and should not be attempted by the average householder. Almost all food can be preserved without danger when clean, sound, unblemished fresh produce is selected, prepared, and canned according to instructions found in an authoritative manual. Any homecanned product or any canned item purchased at a store showing any 57 signs of gas formation, such as bulging lids and ends of cans, should be destroyed or returned to the store. The term food poisoning is usually restricted to an attack of acute intestinal upset due to the bacterial infection of food or drink. The prevention of food poisoning must be concerned with the entire handling of the food from the time it is obtained to its consumption. Only inspected meats and pasturized dairy products should be used. All meat should be thoroughly cooked before it is eaten. If food is not to be eaten immediately after cooking, it should be placed in a refrigerator or ice box. Otherwise, organisms, if present in the warm food, will have an excellent opportunity to multiply. 'The protection of custard and cream fillings and combination meat dishes (meat pies, etc.) requires the greatest care and vigilance. 'The organisms which produce toxin are present everywhere; therefore, this type of food should be kept carefully refrigerated. The consumption of any animal food in the raw condition ls. Attended by a certain amount of risk, particularly milk, cream, and meat. Botulism is caused by a toxin and is not an infection. The causative organism multiplies in the food before it ls consumed and produces a powerful, soluble toxin which gives rise to the disease. Nearly all cases of botulism have been caused by eating food that has not been completely preserved. It is important to remember that non-acid foods are particularly dangerous. 'hese include all vegetables (except tomatoes and rhubarb) meat, fish, poul-. Try and animal products. In most cases where the foods have particu- 58 larly and noticeably spoiled, the cans are bulged, and there are numerous gas bubbles, and the food smells rancid. Never, under any circumstances should one eat any canned food which has any of these symptoms. No reported cases of botulism have occurred in commercially canned food since 1925. However, cases are reported from food that has been processed in the home. Therefore, extreme care must be taken in the process of home canning. Destroy any food taken from a jar with a bulging or corroded lid. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1960 General Consideration If any sickness or upset stomach occurs when contaminated food is suspected, a doctor should be consulted immediately, and the suspected food should not be destroyed until the doctor sees it. He may want a sample of it for a culture. Questions 1. Why does pork need particular attention in the cooking? 2. What are some of the signs of improperly processed foods? Fo iterature—America's Literature — A, New Nation Speaks Lesson 15—The Federalists (and the Great Transition) Elder Briant S. Jacobs (Textbook: America's Literature, by James D. Hart and Clarence Gohdes, Dryden Press, New York, pp. 24-32) For Tuesday, April 19, 1960 Objective: To make preliminary acquaintance with the Federalistic concepts of man and government as written by Timothy Dwight and Alexander Hamilton. HEN the shooting of the American Revolution ended in 1781, the war of words which, in the decades preceding the Revolution, had crescendoed into battle, now continued unabated, and grew even louder and hotter. During the latter part of the eighteenth century the pamphleteer and the orator largely shaped the thinking of the colonies, and out of these fierce controversies came new patterns of thought and government. Before the war the issue was between 'Tory and Rebel. 'Thomas Paine, Patrick Henry, Samuel Adams, James Otis, John Dickinson, and many _ less prominent writers defended the right of the colonies to separate, while such 'Tories as Samuel Seabury courageously answered them blow for blow, and the Anglican minister Jonathan Boucher preached loyalty to England and fear of mob-rule with such sincerity that he began his weekly sermon only after first laying a loaded horse pistol on either side of his pulpit. We must remember that well over a third of the colonists remained loyal to England duriag the war, a majority outwardly sympathizing LESSON DEPARTMENT with the rebels while secretly hoping for a British victory. During the early years of the Rebellion, tens of thousands of them fled to Canada, the West Indies, and Mother England. Need for More Perfect Union The Articles of Confederation, drafted by the Continental Congress in 1776, at the outset of the war, had bound all colonies together, yet robbed no colony of its sovereign powers. Once winning the war no longer consumed their energies, it became increasingly evident that a new form of government would have to be worked out. In general, the new Nation's only identity lay in its being separate from Britain. Until well into the nineteenth century, the great issues to be faced and solved centered about the government's responsibilities to its people: Should the government favor rural agriculture or urban commerce and _ finance? Should property rule, or should the mass of people? Which government was to dominate, state or Federal? How far should revolution go, not only in government but in social patterns, in arts, culture, and in morals? With a pattern of successful revolution behind them, how was the momentum of revolution to be stopped? Having repudiated Mother England, should she now be followed in anything? If so, in what, and how far? Politically, the wobbling country achieved identity by forming one of our two greatest documents: 'The Constitution. But even after the necessary nine states ratified it very reluctantly within the two years following 1787, it still had to be interpreted, a process which continues. 59 But even while these central political and economic issues were paramount, a creative unity-out-ofdiversity process molded the Constitution into the enduring standard of measurement and justice which continues to radiate throughout every phase of the national chiaracter. By contrast, the beginnings in the arts during the same period, before 1800, were so imitative and weak as to be of little consequence: however, the fact that beginings were made is significant. Mlusic drama continued to follow English patterns, although Royal 'Tyler's The Contrast, which appeared in 1787 as a direct imitation of Sheridan's The School for Scandal, contained native American characters and setting which still make it readable. 'Tyler soon became a lawyer, leaving Icadership to Willam Dunlap, the father of drama in America, who devoted his life to the stage by translating, producing, and writing such dramas as his Andre (1798), based on a Revolutionary War theme. The novels followed directly Samuel Richardson's pattern of sentiment and seduction as established in his highly successful Pamela, all heavily moralizing. The Power of Svmpathy, written in 1759, ls accepted as the first American novel, although Susanna Haswell Rowson's Charlotte Temple (1791) with its setting both in England and America, was far more popular, being reprinted as late as 1930. Likewise, the poetry of the Connecticut or Hartford Wits, centering about Yale College, was unashamedly imitative of English models, both during and after the war. But, roughly, until 1800, the Americans were comparaand — 60 tively happy with their imitations; it was the endless tauntings of sophisticated English critics reminding them that they had produced noth. Ing of their own which rubbed salt into this opening cultural and social wound. Federalists Versus Republicans Although the Federalist and Republican political parties were formed in the decades following the Revolutionary War, their opposing philosophies had existed at least a hundred years previous, and with some modification their same beliefs and alignment of forces have continued to the present. Within Washington's first cabinet were the leaders of the two factions, young Alexander Hamilton, who was to lead the Federalists, and Thomas Jefferson, the Republicans (today's Democrats). Short of openly opposing cach other publicly, they did all they could to halt each other's influence, since each feared the other's policies. In 1791 Jefferson and James Madison, representatives of the Virginia planters and their agrarian aristocracy, allied themselves with Irishman George Clinton's 'Tammany faction of New York to oppose the wealthy shipping and financial aristocracy of New York City and Boston, who became the Federalists. Conversely, it was Hamilton's big-city lawyers and moneyed men who had advocated adoption of the Constitution in 1787, and the coon-skin-cap frontiersmen and farmers who feared it, and ratified it so reluctantly. The French Revolution of 1789 was a burning issue throughout the colonies, and created a widening social and economic gap between RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1960 the two parties. Seeing the French peasants executing their wealthy land-holding aristocrats and seizing their property, the Federalists were aghast, and more than all else feared a similar unleashing of rabble democracy in their own streets. In the elections of 1800, they attempted to defeat Jefferson by relating him to Tom Paine and the local French disciples of "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity." As we have seen, they succeeded in making 'Tom Paine into a boogeyman, but the backwoods vote elected Jefferson nevertheless. While Hamilton and his followers were openly pro-Bnitish, Jefferson and his followers defied them by wearing the red French cockades in their hats, and rejoicing at every victory of the "rabble" in France, believing as did Paine, that they were carrying on the second chapter in the world revolution which their own revolution had begun. While President George Washington was so disturbed at the increasing enmity between these two factions that at the end of his first term he wished to resign, it should be pointed out that the strength of the Constitution, as of the Nation ever since, has lain in these factions opposing and, therefore, balancing each other. 'The French people destroyed the opposition against whom they revolted; Napoleon followed. In contrast, the United States permitted both to speak and grow strong; and the great system is the result. But to understand these general principles in terms of pcople, we should see them at work in two prominent Federalists: 'Timothy Dwight and Alexander Hamilton, and, in the next lesson, in Thomas Jefferson. LESSON DEPARTMENT Courtesy Yale University Art Gallery TIMOTHY DWIGHT From a Painting by John Trumbull Timothy Dwight (1752-1817) A grandson of Jonathan Edwards, Timothy Dwight entered Yale at age thirtcen, became a tutor there, and he inspired the troops with his sermons and war songs, the most notable being "Columbia." He was a chaplain during the Revolution, and in 1783, at age thirty-one, he moved to Greenfield, Connecticut, where for twelve years he was minister, community leader, and director of the co-educational school he established. For the last twentythree years of his life he was president of Yale, where he was a great teacher and leader of Calvinism, defending the faith against all attackers. A lifelong Federalist, he attempted to introduce English literature 61 into the curriculum of Yale while still a student, thus furnishing the initiative for the literary group known as the Connecticut Wits. Of the three most prominent members, John 'Trumbull and Dwight remained Federalists, while Joel Barlow followed Paine and _ Jefferson in his personal philosophy. Dwight's Conquest of Canaan, an epic in eleven volumes, written in 1785, when he was thirty-three, was heavily imitative of Iinglish models. Designed to be the first American epic, it was so filled with pretentious language and elaborate descriptions of thunderstorms that his companion wit, John 'Trumbull, suggested it should be equipped with hghtning rods. A careful observer of the rural countryside, Dwight's Travels in New-England and New York provides a keen commentary on the social and economic contemporary scene, and has greater enduring value than his verse. His Greenfield Hill was a long poem modeled after Goldsmith's "Deserted Village." In addition to describing the lovely scenery and rural virtues, which Dwight greatly loved, it eulogizes the virtues of his Federalistic-Calvinistic culture: simplicity and plainness in manners and morals, thrift and industry, and belief in the sustaining power of property personally owned and cared for. In this "western village" where: Prudence eyes her hoard with watchful care And robes of thrift and neatness, all things wear. The evils of European monarchy are absent: the poor are fed, villages are not sold to buy royal gowns, and: No griping landlord here alarms the door 62 To halve, for rent, the poor man's little store. The hymn of praise which Timothy Dwight fashions for his home town strongly predicts Whittier's Snowbound in his confidence in the enduring rural virtues: Sweet-smiling village! Loveliest of the hills! How green thy groves! Glassy rills! With what new joy, I walk thy verdant streets! How often pause, to breathe thy gale of sweets; To mark thy well-built walls! Thy budding fields And every charm, that rural nature yields; And every joy to Competence allied, And every good, that Virtue gains from Pride! How pure thy Several New England clergymen had previously defined the confiscation of church and lands by the French as the cause of the present "triumph of infidelity" in their own midst. 'Timothy Dwight wrote "The Duty of Americans, at the Present Crisis," to warn against the evil French influences then threatening the new Nation, and urged Americans to defend church and country. In his fiery charges of anarchy, lawlessness, immorality, and atheism against the very group which Jefferson and his mass followers openly supported, Dwight exemplifies those conservative aristocrats who, consciously or otherwise, feared a potential uprising and usurpation of control by the poor and the uneducated. In his love for things as they were — love of God, country, education, and morality as defined and defended by patriots, gentlemen, and Christians, he gave much support to the Federalist political cause, clergyman though he was. But to understand RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1960 ALEXANDER HAMILTON From a Contemporary Etching more forcefully who the Federalists were and what thcy were trying to do, we must meet their central personality—the brilliant realist who was their unquestioned torchbearcr: Alexander Hamilton. American nationalism owes more to Hamilton than any other men except Washington and Marshall. Alexander Hamilton's Life (1757- 1804 ) Hamilton was the son of a wealthy planter in the West Indies. He early showed the brilliance and ambition which predicted his mature prominence. Business musfortunes caused his father's bankruptcy, and his mother died in 1768. Knowing that he must make his own way, and desiring to excel, he entered King's College (now Columbia) in 1774, and a year later he wrote two influential pamphlets on colonial politics which made him LESSON DEPARTMENT known among New York's political leaders. In 1776, when the war broke out, he organized an artillery company and was awarded its captaincy, but within the year was appointed to Washington's staff, where he played a key role. Later, he secured a field command and won distinction at Yorktown. In 1780 he married the daughter of General Philip Schuyler of the distinguished New York family by whom he had seven children. After the war he was admitted to the bar, and when but twenty-five was chosen a delegate to Congress. At twenty-nine he was appointed a delegate to the Annapolis Convention and later to the Federal Convention at Philadelphia which had been charged with the responsibility of revising the Articles of Confederation. In the same year he began publishing a series of essays in New York papers which were designed to motivate the wealthy and professional classes to support the new Constitution. Although James Madison and John Jay also contributed, it was Hamilton who conceived the series of essays known as The Iederalist, and much more than half its contents were Hamilton's. These essays are acknowledged to be the clearest, strongest exposition of the theory of American Constitutional law. In 1798, the year the Constitution was finally ratified, Hamilton was appointed Secretary of the Treasury, a position he held until his resignation six years later. It was during this period that he established the national bank, and many money policies which characterize the national economy to the present 63 day. In 1800 he watched in bitterness while his opponent, 'Thomas Jefferson, was elected President. Four years later he was killed in a duel with Aaron Burr. Hamilton's Federalism Because one may see his picture ovaled on a ten-dollar bill, it becomes easy to think of Alexander Hamilton predominantly as an economist or a financier. Although he had an evident genius for administration, and his monetary principles proved themselves so sound that his successors who had most criticized them adopted them with scarcely any changes, Hamilton's great lifelong goal was to build the struggling Nation into a permanent oneness so strong and balanced that it would never break apart. Just as Thomas Paine appeared at precisely the right moment to persuade the colonists that their destiny was separation rather than rebellion, so it was Hamilton's fondest dream to create a strong nationalism or federation of the many states into one at the time when nationalism meant nothing. Everything he did furthered this end. He favored capitalism and the establishment of a national bank because it would unite the colonies together more firmly. For the same reason, he opposed __Jefferson's _—_ agricultural principles: they gave too much selfdetermination over too scattered an area, thus weakening the central governing power. He strongly advocated government supports and subsidies to American manufacturers for the same reason: such a policy would enhance the Nation's united versatility, and not make it solely dependent on agriculture. 64 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1960 The Federalist Hamilton was too much a man of affairs ever to consider himself a literary person. He took pride in writing but little for the public press, feeling it beneath him, yet like Franklin and Jefferson, he made his way in life largely through his use of words. His style is not affected or individualistic, but as one might expect from a lawyer, it is clear, condensed, carefully organized, and entirely confident of cvery assertion. From these qualities come The Federalist's literary excellence. Too sincere ever to deal with trivial or anything less than the whole truth of what the guiding principles of the new Nation must be, if it was to survive, these papers contain the brilliant, creative thinking in the realm of Constitutional law which places them in the first rank of such writings, along with those of Aristotle and Montesquieu. No commentary on this basic document has deserved or received more honor, nor through constant reference has proved itself more indispensable than these writings. Hamilton's fervent belief that government should reflect the wishes of aristocratic owners of property saved the Nation from the excesses of liberalism which characterized the repercussions following the Revolution in France. He_ believed that property was tangible reward to those of superior talent, and that "the power which holds the pursestrings absolutely, must rule." And while in the first of The Federalist papers he admits that the established class of aristocrats will do everything possible to prevent a decrease in their established power and wealth, one cannot know whether their motives are blameless or selfish, for as Hamilton reminds us:. We are not always sure that those who advocate the truth are influenced by purer principles than their antagonists. Ambition, avarice, personal animosity, party opposition, and many other motives not more laudable than these, are apt to operate as well upon those who support as those who oppose the right side of a question. Nor can we cure heresy by persecution, nor gain followers by fire or sword, or by angry words. Wisely he points out how often those who ostensibly work for common folk often are driven inwardly by jealousy or selfishness:. An enlightened zeal for the energy and efficiency of government will be stigmatized as the offspring of a temper fond of despotic power and hostile to the principles of liberty. An over-scrupulous jealousy of danger to the rights of the people, which is more commonly the fault of the head than of the heart, will be represented as mere pretence and artifice, the stale bait for popularity at the expense of the public good. It will be forgotten, on the one hand, that jealousy is the usual concomitant of love, and that the noble enthusiasm of liberty is apt to be infected with a spirit of narrow and illiberal distrust. On the other hand, it will be equally forgotten that the vigor of government is essential to the security of liberty; that, in the contemplation of a sound and wellinformed judgment, their interest can never be separated; and that a dangerous ambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal for rights of the people than under the forbidding appearance of zeal for the firmness and efficiency of government. History will teach us that the former has been found a much more certain road to the introduction of despotism than the latter, and that of those men who have overturned the liberties of republics, the greatest number have begun their career by paying an obsequious court to the people; commencing demagogues, and ending tyrants. LESSON DEPARTMENT The above quotation represents Hamilton fairly, both in the power of his style and for his ideas contained therein. By looking realistically at man, by finding good in him despite his weaknesses, by acknowledging the Constitution to be a compromise, but a compromise heading in the mght direction; by clarifying how checks and balances under the Constitution counter and thus strengthen each other; and by convincing the aristocratic classes that the Constitution safeguarded them from excesses and encroachments, Alexander Hamilton made his unique contribution both to America's literature and to his great legal structure in whose superstructure the peace and future of the Nation has always rested. And if 65 one can achieve the ideal of the Constitutional Convention, which pledged itself to deal in principles, not in men, then he and the Federalist faction, which for so long he spearheaded, deserve man's gratitude for their firm stand on principle as they believed it—principle which has been woven into the heart of the American structure. Thoughts for Discussion 1. During the last decade of the eighteenth century, why was the French Revolution so vital an issue? 2. In what way did Timothy Dwight give added power to the Federalist cause? 3. How could anyone who distrusted the judgment of the common people ever make a contribution of any value to American institutions of Government? 4. In The Federalist Hamilton was trying to convince whom of what? Social Science—Spititual Living in the Nuclear Age Lesson 6—Creative and Spiritual Living — Pathways to Peace — Part 1 Elder Blaine M. Porter For Tuesday, April 26, 1960 Objective: To explore the ways in which creative living can add to the abundance and richness of life. Frontiers of the Modern World The Geographical Frontier. Recorded history reveals that certain segments of mankind in all ages, past and present, have lived on various kinds of frontiers. In early modern history and among more primitive groups, there were those who were courageous and adventurous and sought to explore beyond the confines of their own tnbal area or community. From this early beginning we have had a long succession of explorers, such as Marco Polo, Lief Ericson, Christopher Columbus, Magellan, Lewis and Clark, Admiral Richard E. Byrd, and many others who all went beyond the confines or borders of their towns, communities, or na- 66 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1960 tions, in an effort to provide more information about the geographical make-up and nature of the world in which they lived. 'Today we are living in an era in which man, still adventurous, is seeking more understanding about the physical world in which he lives, as well as desiring to explore the space beyond. When some of the earlier explorers returned home bearing the fruits of amazing discoveries, men had to accommodate themselves to a new world. However, accommodating oneself to a new world comes hard for some people, for the old and familiar ways tend to become secure and beloved. When Columbus came home there were those whose immediate impulse was to cast him into chains, but, in spite of the resistance and unwillingness of some of his contemporaries to accept his discoveries, the march of progress was on; the world changed and men had to adjust to it. Today we have become more accustomed to explorations of the physical world and take for granted that many almost unbelievable discoveries regarding space will occur in our generation. The march of progress continues, and we must learn to accommodate ourselves to the changes in our lives which will inevitably result from these disCOverIes. Social and Political Frontiers. There have been those among us through history who have lived on the frontiers of social and political advancement. Besides the despots and tyrants who have subjugated people and ruled in order to achieve their own selfish whims, we have had many courageous and outstanding statesmen who have made immeasurable contributions to mankind. 'Through their efforts to find a more effective way of creating an environment for man in which he might find opportunity for selfexpression and obtain security for himself and his family, he has been freed from many of the fears and struggles for survival. Achievements in this direction have enabled us to visualize the day when the table will be set for all who want to eat; a day when the human race will form a unifed community and no longer live as separate entities. But advances do not come easily. There are always resisters to change, with their immature minds and feelings of fear and insecurity. Some stood on the rim of a crowd around Socrates, took note of what sounded like subversive utterances, and reported them to the authorities. And this same type of individual continues to function in this resistive capacity today. The Scientific Frontier. Looking at the explorations on the frontier of knowledge and science, we can see Galileo, after dropping his two unequal weights from the Leaning Tower of Pisa (when, contrary to the official views, each reached the ground at the identical moment) being accused of being in league with the devil and threatened with death if he did not deny the truth which he had-discovered. We can see the advances of medical science throttled for many centuries after the discoveries of Hippocrates, because the human body was considered too sacred to be studied in a scientific manner. But man's thirst for knowledge and his desire to find a way to "subdue the earth" has led him to great LESSON DEPARTMENT accomplishments. His imagination has made him remarkable among created things, and that imagination has carried him far beyond the reach of his working hands. The Spiritual Frontier. A_ historical look at the spiritual frontier reveals that many great spiritual leaders were rejected in their day. Yet what a debt the world owes to such individuals as Buddha, Confucious, Gandhi, and others. 'Those living on the spiritual frontier have probably been among the more diligent in seeking to commune with God. And God, through his Son, Jesus Christ, and through his love, kindness, and generosity, has revealed to us many of his goals for man and has, through his prophets, tried to provide a way in which we could live creatively, abundantly, peacefully, with one another. As we stand back and take a look at the world of today and marvel at the great achievements in many fields, man can view his accomplishments and truly say, it is good. But, looking at himself, what can he say? Has he come closer to the realization of another dream of mankind, that of the perfection of man? Of man loving his neighbors, doing justice, speaking the truth, and realizing that which he potentially is, a son of God? Raising the question is embarrassing since the answer is so painfully clear. While we have created wonderful things, we have failed to make of ourselves beings for whom these great accomplishments would seem worthwhile. If we look at the world todav, we realize that ours is not a life of brotherhood, happiness, contentment, but, rather, one of spiritual chaos and bewilderment. We are prone to ignore the shad- 67 ows of uneasiness, anxiety, and confusion which seldom, if ever, leave men. Charting a True Course In this unsettled sea of human perplexities, yearnings, and disappointments, it may pay high dividends for us to pause and eliminate from our minds our immediate demands and schemes for livelihood and personal pleasure, in order that we may chart a course which will lead us to a port wherein we will likely find the goals and values providing eternal satisfaction and happiness. As part of the process of charting this course, it is suggested that we follow the admonition of Socrates when he said, "Know thyself,' and the admonition of President McKay when he _ suggested that we "... Talk with self in a serious sort of way.' Self-understanding is a prerequisite to good mental health and understanding of other people. 'This is important because we are required to relate ourselves to other people and to the conditions of the world in which we live. We then must have an understanding of how these forces affect us and our relationships with others. And as we come to know ourselves and others, we free ourselves to experience more of the potential within us, to achieve creative, harmonious relationships with other people. As we are able to listen, to grasp what other persons are saying, we remove many of the major hostilities of life; we raise the psychological "iron curtain" which may have been lowered between us, and find that many misunderstandings of life have disappeared.

In this sense religion is the most persistently and widely creative of all the enterprises of life. It is life forever looking beyond values already achieved and forever enlisting itself in behalf of values still to be achieved (OverSTREET, Harry A.: The Great Enterprise, page 198, W. W. Norton & Company, Inc., used by permission). The religion of Christianity, in general, and of the Latter-day Saints, in particular, encourages the individual to live beyond mediocrity and dullness, as man on his way to perfection seeks to qualify himself for Godhood. Appraising Our Valucs Some individuals have found themselves in positions of leadership or unique situations which encouraged or forced them to see the world and its problems from a broad point of view; to look at the "whole picture." Perhaps the rest of us could benefit from the experience of such individuals. Henry Cabot Lodge said: If there is one thing which I have learned as a result of four years at the United Nations it is that the sense of justice is very much the same in every man. Regardless of whether he comes from Asia, 69 SPRING TOUR Mesa, St. George and Los Angeles. Leaves in March 1960. HAWAII TOUR Tour leaving June 1960. MEXICAN TOUR February 1960 and June 1960.

The future of the world depends on the cxtent to which we can base international rclations on that sense of justice and fair plav which lives in every human heart (Think, June 1957, page 22). Mary Hawkins, editor of the Journal of Home Economics, reporting on the Ninth International Congress on Home Economics, held in College Park, Maryland, July 1958, stated: With other members of the international permanent council of the federation... A program of importance was developed. But even more than that there was a readiness, a fluidity, a possibility of achievement made ready for the character of the Congress. And a character did unfold. It had many sides, but the most inspiring and 70 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JANUARY 1960 the most awesome was its universality. We saw that "one world" is no longer just a concept; it ls a reality. It operates in the lives of everyday people, not just among statesmen and internationalists. It can bring women in religious habits across an ocean and women in saris halfway around the world to meet together, to find a common denominator of values, and to draw comfort from each other's experiences. It batters against the language barrier and reconciles differences in color, nationality, and occupation. With our minds, we have known that this new character was abroad in the world; we know it now in our hearts and remembered handshakes. We know it in cool Finnish melodies sung on a sticky, southern night. We saw it in each person's realization that he or she had something to give to the Congress (Hawkins, Mary, "This Is Our World," Journal of Home Economics, Vol. 50, No. 8, October 1958, page 611, used by permission). These two individuals as a result of their positions and experiences have been able to see "one world" in the making. 'They have been able to see the contributions which mature, creative living can make. Another experience in life which brings values into sharp focus is the anticipation of death. Mrs. Hazel Beck Andre's account of ""My Last Wonderful Days" provides guidance and inspiration not only for those who anticipate death within a few wecks or days, but for anyone who wishes to live creatively throughout life, realizing that death will ultimately come to him. After telling of her feelings in learning of her condition, the adjustments which she and her husband made, and the manner in which they tried to help their children face the inevitable, she summarizes her philosophy by saying: I have no regrets—my life has been rich and full, and I have loved every minute of it. But if I were to live it over, I would take more time for savoring of beauty—sunrises; opening crabapple_ blossoms... The delighted surprised look on a tiny girl's face as she pets a kitty for the first time. I would eliminate enough outside activities so that I could be always the serene core of my home—for the triumph of serenity has crystallized for me and my family in these last days. There would be more time for family and for close personal friends. I would get closer to people faster. When death is imminent, we open our hearts quickly and wide. How much more Christian love there would be if we didn't wait for death to release our reserves! I would live each day as if it were my last one, as I am doing now (ANDRE, Hazex Beck, "My Last Wonderful Days," Farm Journal, July 1956, used by permission ). Can we take lessons from such experiences to help us reappraise our values in an effort to discover if we are living creatively? Are we experiencing the potential within us? Are we making the contributions in services to others that we might make. Are we contributing to the peace of the world by being aware of the needs of individuals around the world and conditions in which they live, and being aware of the implications which our own interpersonal relationships have as they influence other people? Can our scope and understandings be enlarged in order that we may embrace the following prayer uttered by a fellow American, Benjamin Franklin, when he said: God grant that not only the love of liberty but a thorough knowledge of the rights of man may pervade all the nations of the earth, so that a philosopher may set his foot anywhere on its surface and say, "This is my country."

We took a number of magazincs with us, but The Relief Society Magazine really impressed the women. They said it is What they are striving for. They were amazcd at the scope of our work.... One little woman, a member of the Church, eighty-three years old, who reads very well, has been bedfast in a hospital for six years. She looks forward to our visits and to the Magazine. She says the trouble is the nurses borrow the Magazines before she finishes. Who knows where they might do the most good? —Holly W. Fisher President South African Mission Relief Society Mowbray, South Africa The Magazine certainly is a blessing to all our family, and we enjoy all the articles and stones. 'The recipes are especially interesting. I am the theology teacher in our branch and have enjoyed using the Icsson material in the Magazine and find that very good lessons can be prepared by use of the Magazine and the standard works of the Church. Elder Doxey has done a marvelous job in writing these lessons. —Bernice Kentner North Platte, Nebraska J was thrilled when I read in the October Magazine (Sixty Years Ago, page 656) the account of the Relief Society being organized in St. John, Kansas, July 8, 1899. I was a seventeen-year-old girl living there at that time and well remember that ice cream social and the delicious ice cream. We girls did not quilt, but we helped sew carpet rags and make those comforts. Sister Breckenridge was a lovely lady. All the family are dead now except her daughter Mary. She has just made an extended visit to St. John from her home in Spanish Fork, Utah. Those good old times were the happiest days of my life. —Georgia C. Carr Hattiesburg, Mississippi Page 72 I feel I must write and thank you for the wonderful Relief Society Magazine. I am not able to get to my branch, Georges Lane, Lewisham, London, as I live at Birchington. I read the Magazine and am able to keep up with the lessons, and they help me so much in my lonely evenings. A small group of Relief Society sisters occasionally come to visit me for the day, and an American, Sister McGee, from California, visited me often. But now many of the American lads and their wives are gone away, and many of the big houses are empty now, where your lads and their wives lived, and their children attended our schools. I have met many young missionary lads, as well as servicemen, when I lived at Spur Road, Orpington, Kent, when my husband was alive. I was so fortunate that Sister McGee gave me an invitation to go with her and her husband to the dedication of our beautiful London Temple. When I caught the first glimpse of that spire rising into the sky, I knew for a surety it was the temple of God. Now I must say how sorry I am not to have written sooner to thank you for the wonderful Magazine. —Lily N. Jordan Birchington, England I enjoy the Magazine very much, as do also my family, especially my husband. We think the stories are very good and also the poetry. I have not been without the Magazine in my home since I was first married, some eighteen years ago. —Dorothy M. Loveland Burley, Idaho We have lived in many parts of the world, and I have always thought that the place we were living in at the time was the best place in all the Church in which to live, that the members were kinder, more loving, that the spirit was sweeter. I find that Ames is now the best place to be. Thank you for the wonderful messages you continue to send us in The Relief Society Magazine. It is a privilege to be counted among the members of such an organization. —Virginia Cott Ames, Iowa GET FULL HOUSEPOWER UTAH POWER & LIGHT CO.
