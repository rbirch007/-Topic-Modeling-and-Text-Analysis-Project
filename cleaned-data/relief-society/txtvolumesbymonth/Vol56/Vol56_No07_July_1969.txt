Exulting as they went, their cart wheels spun Into the garnet-studded West. Children of the evening, they? No, of the noon. The scars of the night were washed away, The Zion of their days begun. A thousand miles and pull a cart! They, of avalanche and stone, Of fiords and crags, Of bounties of the sea and shore. Possessions now, were millstones gone. The throated burning in their breasts Enough to feed upon. They knew how far it was, The lingering distance stalked with death. With spider strength, dragged Carcasses of bed and skillet, Flour and salt, through grass of June, July's scorched lips, then to lay their burdens down Upon November's sod. Ground so hallowed, pray Walk unshod.

From Near and Far
I must tell you that I made two gingerbread houses from the recipe in the December Magazine (by Berta Mae Peek). I gave one to some little friends of mine and the other to my own children. All were delighted. I was surprised to find how easy it was to make the houses and how beautiful they were. I am planning to make more cakes next year.

I have been so interested in your story "Welcome the Task" by Michele Bartmess (November 1968 - June 1969). I have a special pride in reading this, too, because I feel a special love for the person writing it. We so enjoyed being able to associate with Michele in BYU's Maeser Hall where we were privileged to be dorm parents.

Caro Wright, Provo, Utah

When I first married I was given a subscription to The Relief Society Magazine as a wedding gift. That was my first introduction, and I have never been without this wonderful Magazine since that time. It has been an inspiration to me as a homemaker. Since I have been in the mission field I have come to a greater awareness of the true value of the Magazine. I have used the materials on many different assignments, and many times the Spirit has directed me to the very issue that has given me guidance and information.

Donna Craven, Auckland, New Zealand

The Relief Society Magazine is certainly a guiding light in my life. It is almost the only Magazine that gives so much wholesome reading. I teach the spiritual living class in Relief Society and I love the lessons as they are presented in the Magazine.

Nadine M. B. Anderson, Steamboat Springs, Colorado

Kind Mormon friends from Washington D. C. introduced me to the Magazine and have it sent to me. I enjoy reading it very much and admire the lovely covers. I am pleased to see the pictures of so many of the sisters and am most grateful for the precious gift of the Magazine.

Marguerite MoIIer, Neuchatel, Switzerland

It is a most satisfying experience to me to realize how very much the sisters in the Canadian Mission love and use the Magazine. They truly make it a vital part of their lives. Of course, to me, it is the breath of home and loved ones, and I turn the pages and read every word. I feel close to all the dear Relief Society sisters, and am grateful for their strength and inspiration.

Ardella Davey, Supervisor, Canadian Mission Relief Society, Brampton, Ontario

I want to tell all of you sisters who work in that lighthouse, that The Relief Society Magazine is the one our sisters here admire most, and we support the organization so that the great work can go forth and our joy can be greater. We are happy to have the Magazine in Spanish.

Adela Zapata de Mejia, Mexico City, Mexico

We have an exceptionally strong and good Relief Society in the Florida Mission. The sisters do wonderful work and receive great assistance from the General Board. The Magazine is wonderful. Only yesterday, an eighty-three-year-old man said to me, "One Magazine I always subscribe to is The Relief Society Magazine. When I read the stories they always bring tears to my eyes, and this is the favorite Magazine of all for me." We have quite a number of saints scattered and living alone out in the islands of the Caribbean, and we always make an effort to see that they get extra copies of the Magazine, if they do not have subscriptions.

Editorial Note: The concluding year of the study of the Doctrine and Covenants will begin in October 1969 in the Northern Hemisphere and in March 1970 in the Southern Hemisphere. | assume that it would be a little easier if I were to address myself to the subject: "When Did I Begin to Study the Gospel of Jesus Christ?" instead of "How I Became Involved in The Doctrine and Covenants," because the Doctrine and Covenants gives us the gospel. In fact, if we were to analyze its doctrines, I do not believe it could be surpassed by any of the other three books of scripture accepted by the Latter-day Saints. Furthermore, we would learn that it is the repository of many doctrines of salvation which are only mentioned or inferred in those other books.

Formative Years in the Priesthood  
As far as I am concerned, my interest in the study of the gospel began when I became a deacon in the Aaronic Priesthood. I believe that because I was given responsibility at that time my interest in the gospel was heightened. It was the practice of the counselor in the bishopric who had charge of the quorum to give assignments to the quorum members to participate in giving parts of the lesson. As an ordained teacher, I became the teacher of the quorum under the direction of a member of the ward bishopric. This practice continued in the priest's quorum; consequently, my interest in the gospel became very great during those formative years in the priesthood. This foundation proved very helpful in preparation for a mission, so much that when I was called to be a missionary at the age of twenty-two, I felt that I was prepared to teach the gospel when I arrived in the mission field.

My interest in the gospel was theological; consequently, | learned the doctrines of the Church from all of the standard works, especially with an emphasis upon the Bible since I knew I would use it as the basis of my missionary work. It wasn't until some years later, except for the use of many passages in the Doctrine and Covenants which provided clear explanations of particular doctrines, that I really studied the Doctrine and Covenants in depth.

The True Concept of God  
Among many other fundamental doctrines, the missionary teaches the investigator the true concept of God. Of all the doctrines of the gospel this one stands out as one of the most important for people to know—since it is life eternal to know God. (John 17:3.) One of the difficulties a nonmember may have in accepting the concept that God is personal, having a body of flesh and bones, is God's attribute of omnipresence. The apostate "Christian" world believes that God is a spirit without form; whereas the Lord has revealed to his prophets, ancient and modern, that he has a body.

He may be said, however, to be a spirit the same as "man is spirit;" that is, he, as well as man, has always been a spirit, from eternity to eternity though in earth-life and the resurrected state the personal spirit is associated with a body. (D&C 93:33; 130:22.) If God has a tangible body, and he is not a spirit only, then how can he be omnipresent, or everywhere? The "Light of Christ" or spirit of the Lord emanates from God to fill all space. (Acts 17:27-28; D&C 88:12.) Because of this omnipresent power, God has communication with all of his creations, and thus he is everywhere, as the scriptures aver.

Salient Principles of Doctrine and Covenants

The Doctrine and Covenant is different from the other three standard works of the Church because it is a little more difficult to maintain interest in sustained reading unless one has a definite objective in his reading, such as theological. There is relatively no narrative in the Doctrine and Covenants. The exception to this is Section 135, the historical account of the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum at Carthage Jail 125 years ago.

I presume that it would not be amiss to suggest an exaggerated comparison of the Doctrine and Covenants and reading the dictionary—in both, there is statement after statement of truths not always connected with the preceding information. This fact, however, has its advantages. One does not have to look very far to find rich, inspiring thoughts. Also, one must concentrate on his reading in order not to miss salient principles.

Years ago I realized that many members of the Church might find difficulty in keeping up their interest in reading the Doctrine and Covenants, so I conceived the idea that this book could be enjoyed more and learned better, perhaps, through the commentaries of the prophets, seers, and revelators of the dispensation. With this and other purposes in mind, I set out to compile such a work, using the sermons and writings of the members of the First Presidencies, Twelve Apostles, and the Patriarchs to explain 485 July 1969 the Doctrine and Covenants.

For well over five years I labored on this project which culminated in the four volumes of The Latter-Day Prophets and the Doctrine and Covenants, published from 1963 to 1965. I have known young as well as old people who have shown unusual interest in the Doctrine and Covenants through the use of these volumes.

Writings of Elder B. H. Roberts

In the years when I was learning the teachings of the Church, I was impressed with the writings of Elder B. H. Roberts of the First Council of Seventy. I remember his quoting a passage from George Rawlinson's Historical Evidences of the Truth of the Scripture Records, as follows:

Of this we may be sure, that if any new forms of evidence should hereafter be needed, to meet any new forms of unbelief, and authenticate afresh the word of truth, they will be found deposited somewhere, waiting for the fulness of time; and God will bring them forth in their season, from the dark hieroglyphics, or the desert sands, or the dusty manuscripts, to confound the adversaries of his word, and to magnify it above all his name. (Quoted in New Witness for God, Volume II, Forewords.)

Under the caption of "The World's Hunger For Knowledge of The Christ," President Roberts quoted the following from the Life of the Master by Rev. John Watson:

Were a parchment discovered in an Egyptian mound, six inches square, containing fifty words which were certainly spoken by Jesus, this utterance would count more than all the books which have been published since the first century. (Ibid.)

Although Elder Roberts used these quotations to support the Book of Mormon, I came early in life to know that we do have the words of Christ in the Doctrine and Covenants, in fact, hundreds and hundreds of them spoken to his Prophet, Joseph Smith.

The introduction to the revelations in this book of scripture reveals the author as the Savior. Examples are:

Hearken, O ye people of my church—1:1.
to the voice of Jesus Christ, your Lord, your God, and your Redeemer (27:1.)
Behold, thus saith the Lord, even Alpha and Omega... (54:1.)

A Witness for the Savior

The Lord declared, however, that the revelations were given after the manner of the Prophet's language. (D&C 1:24.)

The Doctrine and Covenants stands as a witness for Jesus that he is the Savior of those who want to be saved. The doctrine that salvation comes only to those who accept him and thus he saves only them, is taught plainly. (D&C 42:1; 29:17.)

In truth, the Doctrine and Covenants is an answer to the present thought among some theologians that God is dead, a notion that has received wide publicity. The modern scriptures declare plainly that God lives!

Two important accounts of the appearance of the Savior in this generation are given in the Doctrine and Covenants:

(1) The stirring description by the Prophet Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon is a testimony to this fact.

And now after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives! For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father—
That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God. (D&C 76:22-24.)

(2) We know of the glorified account of the Savior's appearance to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in the Kirtland Temple on April 3, 1836.

The veil was taken from our minds, and the eyes of our understanding were opened. We saw the Lord standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit, before us; and under his feet was a paved work of pure gold, in color like amber. His eyes were as a flame of fire; the hair of his head was white like the pure snow; his countenance shone above the brightness of the sun; and his voice was as the sound of the rushing of great waters, even the voice of Jehovah, saying: I am the first and last; I am he who liveth, I am he who was slain; I am your advocate with the Father. (D&C 110:1-4.)

In a scholarly article entitled "The Requiem for God," the author gives four causes for the belief that God is dead. Among these is the awareness of suffering in the 20th century demonstrated in the work of "Christians" at the Auschwitz Prison Camp where thousands of Jews perished in death chambers.

Paraphrasing the words of the author, Doris Donnelly, she said that the terrible suffering that is occurring in the world can only be attributed to God if he is made into a monster. ("The Requiem For God," Religious Education, July-August 1967, p.

318.) To the Latter-day Saint the Lord has revealed the why and wherefore of human suffering, and in doing so he has given us the strength and power to endure. The inspired words given to the Prophet Joseph Smith in Liberty Jail, Missouri, provide this blessing: "Know thou, my son, that all these things (sufferings and the tribulations) shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good. The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he?" (D&C 122:7-8.) Truly, when man knows the purpose of suffering, he is better able to endure it. Ultimately, sorrow, suffering, and like adversities are for our development, growth and purification. (Lesson 92 "Adversity," Relief Society Magazine, October 1968.)

A Witness for the Bible

I learned that in addition to the power of the Doctrine and Covenants as a testator for the Savior, it also helped me immeasurably as a student of the gospel to affirm my faith in and acceptance of other Biblical teachings. I believe that the modern standard works of the Church have greatly increased the faith of Latter-day Saints in the Bible, a book which has lost ground among "Christian" people. President Brigham Young said he expected to see the Bible voted out of the so-called Christian world, and progress was being made in doing so in his day. (Discourses of Brigham Young, p. 125.) Since then, the Bible has been quite generally set aside as being true. Fundamental gospel teachings have been rejected.

As long ago as 1929, in a survey of 500 ministers and 487 students studying for the ministry, many teachings held dear to the older ministers were not acceptable to most of the younger men. (Leo Rosten, editor, A Guide to the Religions of America, pp. 236-238.)

On the other hand, the Lord said to the Prophet Joseph Smith that the revelations he gave him would have the effect of increasing faith among men. (D&C 1:17-23.) Thousands of people have had their faith restored and also increased in the credibility of the Bible through their acceptance of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

The trek of our pioneer forefathers over long miles of plains bears solemn testimony to their faith built upon modern revelation. President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., caught the sacrifice and toil of these hardy, faithful men and women as he described in a general conference later published in a book "To Them of the Last Wagon," this magnificent accomplishment, as follows:

That evening was the last of the great trek, the mightiest trek that history records since Israel's flight from Egypt, and as the sun sank below the mountain peaks they of the last wagon, and of the wagon before them, and of the one before that, and so the very front wagon of the train, these all sank to their knees in the joy of their souls, thanking God that at last they were in Zion. "Zion, Zion, lovely Zion; Beautiful Zion, Zion, City of our God." They knew there was a God, for only he could have brought them triumphantly, militantly, through all the scorn, the ridicule, the slander, the tarrings and featherings, the whippings, the burnings, the plunderings, the murderings, the ravishing of wives and daughters, that had been their lot, the lot of their people since Joseph visioned the Father and the Son. (Conference Report, October 1947, page 158.)

488 Words of the Lord to This Generation

How did I become involved in the study of the Doctrine and Covenants? You will have observed by now that my interest came about as a youth because I needed the Doctrine and Covenants to clarify many Bible doctrines in my preparation for the mission field. Also, I came to know that this book of scripture is a witness for the divinity of the Savior. In addition, I saw in the Doctrine and Covenants the words of the Lord Jesus Christ to the people of this generation. This last fact was apparent, for it is a modern book intended to guide people on the road to salvation in the present world.

In the Bible there are many prophecies regarding the last days. My interest was aroused in the Doctrine and Covenants because it is a "voice of warning" to the people of our times, just as the Bible was intended to "warn" the people of the generations about which it speaks, and at the same time, in prophecy, it spoke of our dispensation.

In other words, to have the Creator of the earth inform us of what is to happen to this world and its inhabitants today even more clearly than the information on this subject in the Bible, is a stimulus for the members of the Church to become involved in the Doctrine and Covenants. For example, the very conditions which we see today—extreme wickedness, disbelief in God, people becoming laws unto themselves—were foreknown.

Of interest to all of us are world events. The political unrest among the nations, the extent of rumors of wars and actual conflict, together with the great amount of sickness and natural calamities, all signify that the times prophesied are with us. Unless extreme apathy has taken hold of us, it is difficult to understand why a Latter-day Saint would not want to understand the signs preceding the second coming of Christ. We should look forward to his coming. (D&C 45:39-42.)

The Purpose of Life

I doubt that there is a person who at some time in his life, if not many times, has not wondered about the purpose of this life and especially the important question as to what lies beyond the grave. This ever-present question is revealed in the Doctrine and Covenants, especially the future existence following the spirit world.

The truth is taught that man had a premortal state and that the earth was created for man. (D&C 92:23-29; 49:16-17.) Man is spirit and body to be wed eventually by the resurrection. (Ibid., 88:15-16.) The doctrine of the resurrection is revealed plainly, and evidence to support belief in the resurrection is given in accounts of resurrected beings communing with mortals. Such examples are: John the Baptist, Peter and James, Elijah, Moses and other prophets. ([Ibid., 27:5-14; 128:21.)

One of the most distinctive doctrines taught in the modern revelations that has found unusual interest and profit is the one regarding the various kingdoms following the resurrection. Who has not thrilled with this "transcript from the eternal world," as he has come to understand the magnanimity, mercy, and justice of God in this divine plan? How wonderful it is to have one's eyes opened to understand the opportunity to receive exaltation—all that the Father hath?

Early in life I learned this great truth, and I came to love it because it was congenial to my soul. I believe that this doctrine motivates one to serve the Lord with all his heart, might, mind, and strength. As one comes to love one teaching after another, his whole being takes on new life and new purpose.

The visions of the prophets become his _ visions and his goals. The same spirit that revealed the teachings of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the prophets also reveals these truths to the one who becomes involved in the Doctrine and Covenants. He loves the Lord because he knows that the Lord loves him. He understands what it means when the Lord said: That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that - hight groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day. (D&C 50:24.) How to Become Involved in the Doctrine and Covenants. If someone were to ask me what he or she could do to become involved in this wonderful book of scripture, I would offer the following: 

1. She could undertake an assignment to teach this book.
2. If this opportunity were not available in the classroom, she could assume that someday she would need the teachings of the Doctrine and 489 July 1969 Covenants to help her as a teacher, administrator in the Church, to assume the responsibilities of a parent, to abide by the charge of "every member a missionary," and above all for her own salvation.
3. She could ask herself a series of questions about the doctrines of the Church periodically and then endeavor to learn the answers to these questions from the Doctrine and Covenants by the use of the index, concordance, commentaries, and other means.
4. She could resolve to set aside ten or fifteen minutes each day to read the revelations. If there were times when she found it hard to follow this practice she could remember the advice of President Brigham Young concerning prayer: If you do not feel like praying then get down on your knees, then stay there until you get the spirit of prayer. (Journal of Discourses 7:164.) So also, she could be as persistent until she became the victor.

No doubt other means might be employed of accomplishing the same purpose. In any case, I bear testimony that a knowledge of the teachings of the Doctrine and Covenants is necessary to attain the heights of performance required to receive eternal life. The revelations are true, Joseph Smith is a prophet, and his successors enjoy the same calling. All of this means that Jesus Christ is our Savior in every sense of the word; he lives, this I know by the testimony of the Spirit.

HIS GIFT

They say six thousand of them perished as they came this way.
And she was one of those.
He could not fathom why they left her there
Why he must forfeit all her loving care,
Nor why her life must close.
Just eight years old.

He walked the rocky path
With no sweet hand to keep him on the trail.
His father, stumbling on with bitter eyes,
Ruing the day he left his English skies,
Fearing what future griefs might yet unveil—
Desperate and doubtful then—he prayed, and stayed.

Then came gray days,
And homeless, drifting, lonely, seeking years.
He found no Mecca in this rugged land,
No dream fulfilled for him.
Yet for his son
He gave a gift beyond comparison.
He gave America to compensate those tears.

Goal, Understanding, and Technique

Jean Larsen, Instructor in Child Development and Family Relationships at Brigham Young University

The answer to the question, "Should there be discipline?" comes through loud and clear, "Yes, there must be discipline!" But the what, the why, and the how of discipline and guidance are not so clearly spelled out. Not knowing what is expected on either end of the guidance situation provides some frustrating experiences for all concerned.

We recall the story: Bobby had been playing by the duck pond for several minutes when Father called for him to come in the house. Bobby approached his father slowly, looking down at muddy feet and wet pant legs. When Bobby's father saw the mud and the wet, he said in a stern voice, "Well, Bobby, how many times must you be told to stay out of the mud and water?"

Go get me a willow, maybe a 'willowing' will help you remember." Bobby was gone for several minutes before he slowly approached his father again—this time with his hands behind him. His father's voice was again stern as he said, "Well, I'm waiting, give me the willow." Bobby 494 drew both hands around and produced not a willow but several rocks in each hand. Then he said in a meek little voice, "T couldn't find a willow, but here are some rocks to throw at me."

GOAL As adults being responsible for guiding the child we are concerned about his behavior and ways of altering, controlling, or instigating certain behaviors. Guidance can become a battle of wills between adults and children. But, as in all battles, someone must be the victor. Should it be the adult at the expense of the child's curiosity, spontaneous expression, and self-esteem, or should the child be the winner because of his ability to display compulsive, negative, and violent behavior? Power struggles are a risk to any relationship and should be avoided. The goal of guidance is to let the child know what is expected of him, and then provide experiences which will help him to develop self-discipline or control from within.

UNDERSTANDING Why do children do what they do and when will they change? There is a reason why children do what they do. Sometimes adults don't take time or don't try to understand what is behind the behavior. How many times have you heard a parent say to a child, "Now stop crying or [ll really give you something to cry for," assuming that there is not a reason for the child to cry in the first place. Some behavior, although unacceptable to adults, is normal for the child of a given age and may very well pass on like the seasons. Temper tantrums are a normal reaction to frustration for the toddler age. Getting into things, finding out what possibility an object or material has for manipulation, is a force pushing the child from within. Most parents have the same concerns. "Why can't my child be quiet in Church?" or "Just when I want him to behave, he really acts up." A new situation or one that does not necessarily accommodate to the child usually produces child behavior that the adult does not approve of. The most difficult time in many households is the dinner hour. Mother may be intent on preparing the meal, younger children are tired and hungry, and Father and the older children need a listening ear after their day away from home. Tension runs high in such a situation.

Keys to Child Guidance Sometimes children do what they do because they do not know what is expected of them.

TECHNIQUE Guidance involves evaluation of and reaction to behaviors. Because each of us is an individual dealing with another unique individual, successful techniques will vary. There are some guidelines which may serve as a basis for dealing with behavior in general. First, punishment does not teach or show the child the type of behavior you want exemplified. It may cut off the behavior or traumatize the child about that which he should not do, but punishment does not establish what the child should do. Toddlers are notorious for using primitive social techniques. Usually, if another child has something they want they will bite, poke, pull or hit in order to gain possession. Many parents see this behavior and become very anxious. Usually, someone will suggest that the way to teach them not to bite is for you to bite them back. Will your biting the child teach him what you want him to do? Second, it is not wise to try to cut off a child's curiosity. This is like trying to stop his growth. Foster his asking questions and trying things out. If the behavior is caused because of a growing curiosity, then tolerate or channel, but be very selective when you stop this kind of behavior. Water play is one of the most soothing types of play a child of most young ages can engage in. However, water play and other related sensory types of play need to be channeled. A mother might respond, "No, I can't have you pouring water from container to container here on the kitchen floor, but outside (or a protected area inside) you may do so."

Third, try looking at things from the child's point of view. Rather than expecting the child to come all the way in an intolerable situation, see what you can do to make it easier for him. Sincere praise for just being himself can modify a child's behavior. Some adults feel compliments are not for children, but if there is a basis for them, they should be used. There was a five-year-old in the nursery school who seemed to be overflowing with good ideas. The teacher in the nursery group would frequently comment to this child, "John, you are clever!" One day a parent said to the teacher, "Why are you always telling that child he's clever? Don't you think he'll become egocentric?" The teacher replied that she felt children's behavior was greatly influenced by the way others reacted to them both by words and deeds. Sometime later John was watching a disgruntled repairman fixing a plugged up sink in the nursery school. As the repairman took off the gooseneck and found it filled with sand, it appeared he was going to explode. John, who had been watching the operation, looked up at the man's angry face and said, "My, you're clever to be able to fix that sink." The repairman's anger turned into a friendly smile as he said, "Well, I guess I am clever at that."

A fourth guide would be to feed into the child love, warmth, gentleness, and self-worth. Children learn what they live. A child who has received has something to give back. A fifth and concluding guide deals with letting the child know what is expected of him. Teach the child what to do rather than what not to do. Help the child see reasons, outcomes, and responsibilities. This is the opposite from threats and retaliations. Provide experiences whereby the child can develop inner control through understanding rather than control through fear.

Mary had been cutting and pasting at the art table. When she was nearly finished with her picture she noticed how easily her scissors snipped off small corners and pieces of the paper. Mary snipped and watched the small pieces flutter to the floor. Soon it looked like snow and soon the floor looked like a real storm had hit. The teacher came to Mary and said, "When Mr. Bob, our custodian, comes in to clean tonight, he'll wonder what has been happening in this room." Mary thought for a moment and then replied, "I'll need to get this mess cleaned up, would you hold the dustpan while I sweep?" Make teaching your discipline and take the initiative to discuss, explain, interpret, and demonstrate desirable behavior.

If your guidance relationship is constant and you are accepting of the fact that each experience will not be a successful one—it takes a long time to learn—eventually you will reach the goal of establishing self-worth and controls from within the child.

Oe @ Lenora Peterson had hurriedly glanced at the clock as she popped the frozen peas into the steaming pot of chicken and noodles. Time had more than caught up with her, and the missionaries would be coming to dinner in about twenty minutes. She always tried to have the meal ready exactly when the elders arrived as time was so precious to them. Today had been unusually busy. At Relief Society that morning Sister Lemmon, the president, had asked her to stop by Sister Slack's home and pick up some ironing. After a few days home from the hospital with another new baby, Sister Slack had suffered a set-back and was ordered to bed by her doctor for a week or more. The Relief Society sisters were assisting the family with the work, food, and the small children.

Lenora had spent most of the day ironing, so she could return it to Sister Slack later on tonight. I-do wish Maida would get home soon, she thought as she added a bit more salt to the noodles; she's such a big help when time is pressing. Maida had announced her intention of being a little late today, as it was the final tryouts for the high school musical. Of the ten who had competed for the coveted part, she was one of three finalists. She had been an "almoster" the past three years, and had come so close to getting parts in the school productions that this last chance in her senior year was, at the moment, the most important thing in her life.

Lenora turned the flame down on the noodles and started buttering the French bread. As the knife smoothed the soft spread over the slices she smiled faintly, her eyes watered a bit, and her mind shifted in reverse to more than a decade ago. No matter how many times she prepared dinner for the missionaries, this backward glance was a mental ritual with her—a way of giving thanks for a second chance.

Life had been so different and wonderful when she and George had moved from southeastern Idaho. Even though Church membership was large here on the West Coast, the saints were still a minority in this teeming metropolis, but the missionaries had found this a fruitful field. George had immediately befriended the missionaries and shared his own experiences with them. Knowing what a real home-cooked meal meant to a young missionary far away from home, he wanted to invite them to dinner, and Lenora had agreed wholeheartedly. She wanted it to be a very special meal. These young men so valiantly serving the Lord deserved the very best.

For days she planned the meal, shifted the food budget, in order to buy the choicest steaks, and put an all-out effort into the occasion. Every minute of that first day that the elders came to dinner was spent in cleaning every corner, making a table arrangement that resembled a page from Home Lovely, and preparing food fit for the most critical gourmet. It was worth it though—the way those hungry boys devoured every morsel, the praise they heaped on her, George's look of satisfaction. She had fed the children early, sent them to their rooms, and planned an after-dinner relaxation period around the fireplace with hot buttered popcorn, crisp apples, happy conversation, and a background of soft nostalgic stereo music.

Her plans were shattered though as the elders had to eat and run in order to make an early evening appointment. It was some time before they were invited again. Such a meal played havoc with her grocery budget, and she expended so much time and energy in preparing it that she needed a couple of months' rest between invitations.

Lenora put as much dedication into the second meal as she had the first, and the new elders praised her highly. She felt especially happy, and after bidding the young men goodbye, she went to check on the children. As she neared the bedroom she noticed the door was slightly open, and heard the children talking. Maida had a play telephone to her ear, and the first words Lenora caught were, "Yes, we're having missionaries to dinner tonight." Lenora paused and smiled with deep satisfaction. How sweet, she thought, children usually imitate their parents in play. Having the missionaries to dinner is evidently making an impression on her.

She stood outside unnoticed as Maida's conversation continued. "I'm sorry your baby suddenly got sick, Sister Nelson, but I can't take your Primary class today. The missionaries are coming to dinner. No, I can't tend your children while you go visiting teaching, Sister Gregerson. We're having the missionaries tonight."

And then it was Vernon's voice. "No, you can't bring your friends in the house today. It must be clean for the missionaries tonight.... No, you can't eat at the table with us tonight. I don't want to be embarrassed by you or Maida spilling your milk, and baby Paul tossing food all over."

The pleased look drained from Missionaries to Dinner Lenora's face. Somehow the replay of her own words sounded different from the original.

It was Vernon again, "Ah, let's not play 'missionaries' any more. I'm tired of it." "But, Vern, when you go on your mission, you'll be invited out to dinner, and you've got to know all about it." "T don't wanna' go on a mission, 'cause when people ask missionaries to dinner, then the mother's not nice, and she can't do anything else to help anybody, and all she cares about is a clean house and fancy food, and the children have to eat sandwiches and then go to their room and [ just don't like it."

Lenora's first reaction was to plunge into the room and give her son a good tongue lashing for his failure to recognize her tireless efforts to serve the missionaries who were in turn serving the Lord. Instead, she dazedly found her way back to the living room and sat at the foot of the reclining chair where George was reading the evening paper. With tear-filled eyes and voice, she related to her husband what she had just overhead.

George listened thoughtfully; then in his usual quiet manner commented, "Well, I guess we'll just have to make a few changes." "T know, dear, I would like to have the elders over again, but if this is the effect it's having on the children, we just won't be able to."

"That's not exactly the type of change I had in mind. As I recall, some of my most pleasant meals in the mission field were when we took potluck with some of the members or investigators."

That hash or watered-down soup tasted as good as if it had been served at the Waldorf-Astoria, because it was served in a homey atmosphere with warmth and love." "But, George, I've tried to serve the missionaries with warmth and love." "Of course you have, dear. You've probably tried so hard it's been a burden on you, and you didn't have enough energy left to be considerate to the children or your friends. How about trying it again soon, and see what can be done about changing the children's 'I-hatethe-missionaries-to-dinner' attitude to 'we-love-them-to-dinner' image." "Well, okay, George, I guess I'm willing to try." Lenora was a little skeptical, though. It had always been so important to her to have the 500 house spotless and the food superior when she entertained guests. "The ensuing days saw Lenora conducting a lot of self-analysis. Was she having the missionaries to dinner as a sincere gesture of love, or was she eager to show off an immaculate house and receive a shower of compliments for her superb cooking? Was she like the Pharisees who paid tithes, yet omitted the more important things of the law? Was she a bit guilty of swallowing the camel and straining at the gnat? She realized that in her narrow effort to perform one benevolent act, she had shunned the opportunity to perform many. Lenora knew it wouldn't be a fast or easy change, but she resolved to try. The next time missionaries were invited she planned it very carefully. She let the children decide on the menu, though she didn't mention guests were coming. How she hoped the elders could tolerate hot dogs on a stick and French fries. She cleaned the house the day before and arose extra early on the appointed day to add the finishing touches. All day she tried especially hard to be pleasant to the children. Though nervous and tense on the inside, she put on a good front before them. She let Vernon and Maida invite some of their neighborhood friends over to make cookies. This would create a happy experience for them and also provide dessert for dinner. All was going well. The children were blissfully up to their elbows in cookie dough, and the first try had been taken from the oven. Just as she had passed around the first samples and observed the looks of pleasure and accomplishment on their faces, the telephone rang. It was Annie next door. Her toddler had fallen and slashed his cheek on the table's edge. The cut looked deep, and Annie was sure stitches would be needed, so she needed Lenora to drive her to the doctor. Annie had a car at home. Why couldn't she drive to the doctor herself? Instinctively, Lenora said, "Oh, I'm sorry, Annie, but..." then caught herself. Quickly she shelved her uncharitable thoughts and realized a mother with a crying, bleeding baby would be in no condition to do any driving. "I'm sorry, Annie," she repeated, "but it will take at least a minute before I can leave." She removed the sheet of half-baked cookies from the oven, hurried the children to the car, and met Annie on the driveway. In a couple of hours they were back home with the injured baby repaired almost as good as new. Time was of the essence now. Lenora flew around her kitchen so fast she even surprised herself. But now the doorbell rang. It was Annie, beaming with gratitude. "Here, Lenora, I thought you might like these radishes for dinner. It's my first experience growing vegetables. I'm as proud as punch over them, and I want to share them with you." "Oh, Annie, how sweet of you. They'll be perfect in the salad. We're having two missionaries from our Church to dinner tonight. They'll so appreciate home-grown radishes." "Oh, Lenora, why didn't you tell me before, and I could have had someone else drive us to the doctor?" Annie paused. "When I have guests for dinner I don't let anything else interfere. You're a real jewel." Lenora had to fight the pangs of self-righteousness after that compliment. She then seized the opportunity to tell her neighbor a bit about the missionary system of the Church. Somehow or other, dinner was ready on time. She had the children set the table and instructed them to set two extra places for the missionaries. Even though the silver was on the wrong side, she didn't have time to worry about it. As they devoured the hot dogs, the rest of the cookies were baking in the oven. How the elders exclaimed over the hot cookies and cold bottled peaches! And during the meal Maida spilled her milk and baby Paul tossed his food, but Lenora tried to take it calmly. While the children helped with the dishes, there were comments. "Those were the best dogs and fries... This has sure been a neat day." After a few more well-planned "missionaries-to-dinner" experiences, the children began remarking, "When are they coming again? Let's have them real soon." Gradually, then, Lenora began really to believe Mr. Emerson's philosophy—that persistence in doing increases one's capacity for that job. Soon the weighty tenseness of company to dinner disappeared, and it became a relaxed, enjoyable experience for herself, her family, and guests. She was amazed that a one-dish missionary meal, cooked in the oven while she taught a Primary class, could taste nearly as good as an all-day preparation of turkey and the trimmings. She was further amazed how on extra busy days when she had the missionaries to dinner, a fifteen-minute cleaning on the front rooms could look almost like the two-hour job. Yes, Lenora had changed over the years, and how grateful she was for that opportunity of eavesdropping on her children so long ago. The sudden slamming of the front door quickly brought Lenora back to the present. "Mom! Mom! I got the part. I really made it this time." Lenora ran through the hall, embraced her daughter. Their squeals of delight resembled a couple of pre-schoolers. "I'm sorry I'm late, Mom. I know we're having the elders to dinner, but they took so long making a decision... What can I do to help with dinner?" "How about getting out the greens from the crisper and making a quick salad?" "I wonder," reflected Maida as she chopped the celery, "what my big brother will be having for dinner tonight." "Well," replied Lenora, "about right now Vernon is sleeping, but in a few hours he'll probably be eating risotto and perhaps a side order of fish." "Or how about peanut butter sandwiches?" Just as Maida placed the salad on the table, the five short and two long buzzes on the doorbell gave the signal that the elders had arrived. As the young girl headed for the door she paused at her mother's side, hugged her gently, and exclaimed, "Oh, Mom, I just love the whole world tonight. I love the judges who gave me the part; I love you; I love my missionary brother..."

And I especially love having missionaries to dinner." 

Dy SUMMER NIGHT And now in gentleness, the sun goes down. Last light of evening edging every hill with gold.
Quietness now—except the crickets' call. A lone hawk wheeling-whistles,
The curlew calls for rain—and in every peaceful hollow
Coolness lies again.

Elizabeth Russell Calgary, Alberta, Canada ~ Woman's Sphere

A Ramona W. Cannon Jessie Evans Smith, wife of President Joseph Fielding Smith of the First Presidency of the Church, has been honored by many student organizations and other groups of young people. A noted singer and beloved exemplary woman, her addresses and her singing have delighted collegiate and Church audiences. In April 1969, she was given a citation as an "Ideal Woman" by the Latter-day Saint co-eds at Utah State University, Logan, Utah. The subject of the meeting was "The Eternal Quest of Womanhood," and Sister Smith addressed the young women, sang a solo, and participated in the music presented by a special chorus.

Also, in April, Sister Smith was honored by Weber State College in the tabernacle, Ogden, Utah. President E. Lamar Buckner said that her visit was the highlight of the year, and that her singing thrilled everyone present. "We are so grateful for your spirit of dedication," he said. "We want you to know that you hold a spot in our hearts, and we shall always be grateful to you for being with us." Sister Smith spoke of the young women as diamonds in a diadem of crown jewels, advising them to make a careful selection of the jewels for their crowns.

Mrs. Evelyn LeTourneau, sixty-eight, of Longview, Texas, wife of industrialist-inventor Robert LeTourneau and mother of four sons and one daughter, was named American Mother of the Year in Los Angeles, California, last May. She was chosen, in part, because she lovingly extended her role of motherhood to students: the Winona Bible Camp groups she established in seven boys' ranches across the country and the student body of the LeTourneau Institute of Technology in Longview.

Mrs. Elizabeth Peterson McKay, a seventy-two-year-old Latter-day Saint woman from Ogden, became Utah's Mother of the Year. She was left a widow with four sons and four daughters from one to sixteen years of age, and through the heroic efforts of all, the children received excellent educations and have become distinguished members of Church and community. She is a woman of talents, sterling character, and refinement.

Mrs. Edna C. Karlinsey, wife of Curtlee J. Karlinsey, Tacoma, Washington, a schoolteacher and mother of seven children, represented the State of Washington as Mother of the Year. An active Latter-day Saint, she has encouraged and assisted her children in attending college and serving missions for the Church. Her talents in teaching, oil painting, and homemaking are outstanding.

Mrs. Jessie Lamb Stewart of Las Vegas, Nevada, Mother of the Year, now a widow, reared four motherless children in addition to her own eight sons and daughters. A devoted Latter-day Saint, she has held numerous offices and teaching assignments in Relief Society. She assisted her husband in managing a large ranch and in raising cattle and thoroughbred horses. She is active in community affairs and in politics.

A chorus of Singing Mothers from the Los Angeles area, directed by Ellen N. Barnes of the General Board of Relief Society, provided music for the Awards Luncheon on May 12th. Many of the 1969 Mothers visited Salt Lake City following the convention in California and were entertained by the Church and by Relief Society.

President Belle S. Spafford is second vice-president of the American Mothers Association.

EDITORIAL / TO EACH IS GIVEN A GIFT

For all have not every gift given unto them; for there are many gifts, and to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God. (D&C 46:11.) (Italics added.)

In his loving-kindness God allows each person to come into the world possessing in his soul embryo gifts to be used and developed as one's free agency determines. While man's mind is veiled from a remembrance of his pre-mortal life, some of the seeds of his accomplishments there are born into mortality with him.

The Father expects life to bring joy to his children. He prepares them for such joy by giving them the gifts with which to acquire it. One of the essential requirements of the Giver of Gifts is that the gift be used for the benefit of others "that all may be profited thereby." (D&C 46:12.) The use of these precious gifts selfishly, for personal gain alone is not the purpose for which they are given.

The intention of the Lord is that gifts be magnified for the building of the kingdom. The rewards of such increase are that the gifts will be added upon. No one, we are told, lives to his fullest potential. Always there are greater goals to conquer. Efforts to reach that potential are crowned with the increased desire to do more and progress further.

Gifts are to be sought. The prophets exhort the people to "covet earnestly the best gifts." (1 Cor. 12:31.) The blessings of spiritual growth are contingent upon asking in faith for one or more of the gifts. Proficiency is to be gained by personal effort and constant prayer to God to bless those efforts.

Gifts are many and varied. They encompass gifts of knowledge and understanding of gospel doctrine given by the Holy Ghost, talents in culture areas. Talents are given in music, literature, and art, in the realms of medicine, in aptitudes in educational pursuits, in the fields of engineering, and agriculture. The gifts are as diverse as the ability to love all of God's creations, a cheerful spirit, friendliness.

To some is given the gift of leadership, to others the gift of following, not blindly but understandingly. Some are the lawgivers, the wise and sagacious, others are the workers who uncover the secrets of nature. Some possess gifts that even they do not suspect until they are brought to light by obedience to commandments. Some gifts are never discovered because they are not sought.

There are those who resist the disciplines the development of a talent requires. They will not accept the responsibility bestowed with the gift to work toward its fulfillment. The potential for greatness is there but as a fallow field lies unused and dormant, idle in the sun, its potential for growth and production curtailed, so lie buried talents the owners fail to enlarge.

These are the unprofitable servants of the parable of the talents whose condemnation is greater than the loss of the talent. Their condemnation is greater than they would have received had they not been given the gift.

There are those who reject the gifts so willingly given by a loving Father, those whose self-afflicted blindness, whose spiritual unawareness prevent their accepting a glorious opportunity to use the gift in perfecting themselves and in helping build the kingdom of God.

Relief Society is a marvelous gift given by our Heavenly Father to his daughters, which some of the unseeing women of the Church have not yet accepted. The loss to themselves is great and to their families, husband, and children, but the loss to the building of the kingdom of God on earth is equally great. Failure to accept the God-given gifts results in failure to live most abundantly. Each gift is spiritual if used to elevate, to build, to make the world better. No gift is a small one. Its size is determined by the receiver. All gifts are given that each might contribute to the work of the Lord.

505 Is Not Veiled
Marian Gardner Nielsen

When the three sisters, Gwen, Mary, and Maggie made the final decision, they knew there were still problems to be solved. Getting Gwen's three lively boys settled at Maggie's would entail planning and cajoling. Telephoning Mary's husband in New York about the change of plans was going to take some diplomacy. The real problem was getting their mother out of the hospital and then getting her comfortably and safely back home.

The plan was simple on the surface. Gwen would go to Cedar Mesa on the plane with their mother. Maggie would keep Gwen's children, and Mary would drive down by car first to get the house ready for the mother's homecoming.

506
Gwen was washing the boys' play clothes, mending overalls, and folding and packing their Sunday clothes. She had a batch of bread in the oven. The baby's bed would be taken to Maggie's later. The trip would probably take four or five days, so she must leave plenty of clothes for the children. Gwen hoped she could get a batch of cookies made to take to Maggie. It would be the hardest on Maggie—what with four youngsters of her own—and she did look a little peaked lately. Gwen had wanted to get a babysitter but Maggie had insisted on having the three little boys come to her place.

Maggie had begun to carry out necessary plans, too. She had made room for Gwen's baby bed in the family room. Hy could set up two army cots in the boys' room. She would move her own baby bed into their bedroom. That way, everyone would be comfortable. She would make stew for the boys and maybe set some jello for dessert. Even thinking about food made her squeamish. You'd think after four babies.

She hadn't told her sisters about her pregnancy. She knew what Gwen would say, "Well, that settles it! I am going to get Jane to come over." Mary was not looking forward to these eight hours of steady driving to Cedar Mesa. It had been nearly ten years since she had driven down that road—ten years of a successful career, and, she admitted wryly to herself, ten years of unsuccessful marriage.

And the telephone conversation with James last night had not helped. She knew she had been too brisk, too impersonal on the phone, but habit was hard to break.
"James, Mother is well enough to leave the hospital... Oh, she's fine. She said to tell you hello and she would like to see you."
"Oh. Yes. Well, Gwen will go down with Mother on the plane. Maggie will keep Gwen's children, and I am leaving in the morning for Cedar Mesa to get the house ready.... Why? Well, I have no ties to keep me home."

When James asked "Mary, are you coming back here?" she had answered, "I don't know, James." His "Well, suit yourself" was as cold as her "Goodbye, James." Mary's hands tightened on the wheel. She had not let herself think of the marriage. That is, Love Is Not Veiled not until she had accepted the position with the publishing company.

James had not objected then. As she became successful in her work and spent more time at it, James became resentful. He objected when she spent the summer in Europe for the firm. Why couldn't he accept her success? The house was fine and the cook served better meals than Mary could prepare. She had tried to get close to James again, to get their marriage on an even keel. But now it was a cool neutrality.

She was not sure that she wanted to go back to New York—especially since she had stayed in Gwen's comfortably furnished home with its confusion and love. And in the shabby, bulging home where Maggie was a lovely and beloved wife and mother. It was not until Mary came to the Colorado River that she threw off her unhappy mood and began to notice the spectacular scenery.

She still missed the narrow, colorful, trestle bridge which had spanned the river when she was a girl, however the sheer red cliffs were still blazing in the sun, their dark shadows darker still because of the intense sun-glare of their lacquered surfaces. She slowed down to catch glimpses of her favorite places. Here was the famous fault that her geology professor had told the class about. There was the little meadow where the five quaking aspens grew—and there they were! But they were taller, with their golden leaves twinkling in the sunlight.

She glanced at the familiar 507 Opened Windows, and aired out each room as she went from one.
When the boys snuggled under the warm, tied wool quilts!
The long table in the dining room was still scarred where the table tennis net had been screwed on too tightly.
The big, sunny kitchen still echoed with the sounds of pulling honey candy, and sitting down to Mother's cooked dinners.

She had stepped quietly into the corner bedroom and had felt the presence of her father and mother still there. It was a good house. It was a good feeling Mary had as she went through it. She touched the familiar pictures, ran her fingers along the faded and broken piano keys. Even in the daylight she switched on the lights in the living room to see if she could catch the rainbows in the prisms of the chandelier the whole family loved.

She still wondered why her father had never bought a dishwasher. It would have saved her mother so many hours.

Well, if she was going to get to the Merc before closing time, she'd better go. She decided to walk the three blocks to the store. She was stiff from driving and the walk would do her good. Besides, she might see some of her old friends or her mother's friends. Too, she would have to pass Aunt Irene's. Perhaps she would be working among her roses where she was usually seen. It had been difficult to explain to James' friends that all her "Aunts" were really not Aunts at all, but were the older women she knew and loved. Everyone called these dear friends "Aunts." Call them "Mrs Galbraith" or "Mrs Taylor"? That was too formal for Cedar Mesa folk. It had sounded a little provincial, later, when she thought about it. But home again at Cedar Mesa it sounded all right to talk about "Aunt Irene" and "Aunt Hattie" and all the rest. They seemed closer to you, that way.

Aunt Irene wasn't in her roses when Mary passed her house. She stopped at the telephone office and asked to have her mother's phone connected. She walked into the Merc, took a basket and selected the groceries she would need. The clerks were all strangers, the few people in the store busy with their own buying. When she paid the bill she felt distinctly let down. Old Home Town, indeed!

On the corner near home she met Ruth Murphy—Ruth Layman she was now—the tall, weary-looking woman informed her. But Ruth was in a hurry to get supper for her large family so she spent little time talking.

"Tam so glad your mother is coming home. We've all missed her—and worried about her."

"She had a rough time, Ruth, but the doctor says she will be all right. She's coming in a day or so. I'll stay until she is up and around and can do for herself."

"Well, we must get the old crowd together while you're here. I'll give you a ring. See you later, Mary."

Ruth hurried down the street to her small trailer house. The feeling of not belonging persisted. Mary was tired. She wanted to get right home, take a shower and get into bed. She hoped she wouldn't see anyone else now; she didn't feel like talking.

She saw Johnny Jones, her father's old friend, hobble out of his lot to intercept her, but she pretended not to see him and hurried along faster. But the minute she stepped into the house, serenity returned and Mary became receptive to the enfolding arms of the dear home. She fixed a sandwich and 509 July 1969 a glass of milk and went into the living room to eat it.

She picked up an open book from the table, Collection of Great Poems, and leafed through its pages. It was a favorite—book of her mother's and the penned comments on the page margins brought the beloved voice into focus reading to the children in the evenings. When she finally closed the volume and placed it almost reverently on the table, she was ready for bed.

She was going to plan her work for the next day, but dropped off to sleep immediately.

It was a bright, hushed morning when she awoke. For a moment she felt as she did years before when she was waking in that same room—a sense of anticipation, a surge of interest, a feeling of expectancy. A knock on the door brought her to her feet.

"I'm coming," she called. "Just a minute."

"Oh, Mary, it's just your old Aunt Gen. [I'm already in.] She peered around the door. "How good to see you. You haven't—changed a bit still the prettiest girl in town!"

She planted a quick kiss on Mary's surprised face.

"So your mother's coming home tomorrow! We've been keeping in touch with Gwen. It will be so wonderful to have her back. You know," Aunt Gen spoke tenderly, "you look more like her than any of the girls."

Quick tears stung Mary's eyes as she held the frail woman close.

"That's the nicest thing anyone has said to me for years. Come and sit down, Aunt Gen, and 510 what do you have under that napkin?"

"Just a few cinnamon rolls for your breakfast. I knew you wouldn't stop to cook anything."

She surveyed Mary with bright black eyes.

"You're too thin. And your eyes tell me you are not happy. What's the matter?"

Mary laughed.

"Oh, Aunt Gen, you always did say my eyes gave me away. You're wrong. I'm—fine. And now that I'm home, I'm beginning to be myself again."

Aunt Gen noticed the slight hesitation, but she changed the subject.

"You see, I have on my working apron. I am going to stay and help you get this house all ready for your mother's return. Oh, I know," she shook her head, "you think you can do it alone. Well, maybe you can, but we're going to help."

"We?"

"Certainly... Irene, Lydie, Addie, and Natalie. Do you think we girls would let your mother down? After sixty years of being as close as we are? Not for one minute! Now eat your rolls, child."

Mary sat down and helplessly watched Aunt Gen take over—as she always did.

The cinnamon rolls were warm and sweet and she ate the three without even once thinking of her diet. Aunt Irene brought a casserole and greeted Mary with love and a few happy tears. Aunt Lydie and Aunt Addie came in talking a blue streak... Not expecting Mary to answer. Aunt Natalie was late, but her warm greeting and her gentle manner made Mary realize why her mother loved Natalie so much.

It was a lovely day. Actually, Mary didn't accomplish much. Every time she started to dust or vacuum or wash windows one of the aunts firmly pushed her aside. Mostly, she listened to the familiar stories, laughed at the same anecdotes, and hummed the same nostalgic songs.

Just as the sun stepped behind the Bear's Ears and flung its painted shafts at the drowsy sky, the women finished their work. Gwen called later that night to say that the plane would land at the airport at Cedar Mesa at four-thirty the next afternoon. Mary called Aunt Irene who said she would tell the others.

"Don't cook your roast, Mary, save it for another day. I am bringing chicken a la Maryland that your mother likes so well."

"But, Aunt Irene."

"Now, Mary! I'm in a hurry. Goodbye."

The next morning Mary rose early. She went out to the strawberry patch and picked a bowl of the plump sweet berries. As she washed them she thought how her mother liked them and how proud she was of her berry—patch.

All morning neighbors came in and greeted her with familiar affection. They were all so happy that her mother was coming home. Shy Mrs. Sanchez, who helped with the ironing, brought a basket of peppers—huge green bell peppers, round orange-red pimentos, long, pale-green mild ones and slim, dark-green hot ones. Becky brought a big apple pie, freshly baked.

The little schoolteacher's wife, whom her mother had befriended, slipped her choice casserole into the Love Is Not Veiled oven. Aunt Gladys brought a loaf of her stone ground brown bread. There were bottles of sour cherry jelly, Doris' pretty pickles, a ground raisin cake, and a tin of rolls almost ready for the oven. Mary could only thank the people, her voice choking on inadequate words. How hospitable they were! How could she have forgotten her mother's lovely friends? Yes, and hers, too. How could she have cast aside these cherished customs?

The first thing her mother saw when she got home from the airport were the fresh flowers. The house was full of them: roses in tall vases; late velvety clematis in a low crystal bowl; zinnias, asters, petunias, and a pottery jar filled with brown-hearted sunflowers. Mary gasped in surprise.

"The Garden Club! How they must have worked to get them all here, fresh and smiling," her mother exclaimed. She wandered slowly through the shiny rooms smelling the fragrant bouquets, noting gleaming windows and crisp curtains. At last she settled down in her own room.

"How good to be home. How wonderful to be in my own room again. God has been good to me. He sent love to make me happy. He sent comfort to me when I was sorrowful. Children and all of my friends to sustain me in my illness. I am so grateful for his sharing these 'things with me."

She looked up at Mary, her face tender, meaningful.

"Sharing is a part of life, Mary. You have to be able to receive by knowing how to give." 

Mary nodded. She took Gwen's hand and the two sisters left, their mother's understanding smile blessing them.

It was late that night that Mary made up her mind. She put in the call to James in New York, her hand unsteady on the receiver. When he answered she could hardly bring herself to speak. Then, humbly, sincerely, with sweet tones of love, she said, "James, do you really want me to come home?"

And the sudden radiance in her face lighted up the whole room.

OaS> THE INFINITE COMPOSER

The great composer sat within his room,
And wrote a part for every instrument.
He blended wondrous themes into a whole
Most beautiful, and yet: so quickly spent.
But there is one whose genius is more great,
His work is far more beautiful to see,
He blended all live things, all natural sounds
Into an everlasting symphony.

He took the mighty ocean's angry roar
And tempered it with plaintive cries of gulls,
The calls of cormorants and guillemots,
Which fly for shelter till the great storm lulls.
He shaped the rolling uplands, and the plains
With March wind whispering through the waving grass,
With shyest creatures swiftly burrow bound
As human steps approach, and gently pass.

He sent the speeding comet on its course
That each might have free passage on its flight,
Then massed the myriad-stars of Milky Way
Into a highway of celestial light.
His orchestra is heard throughout the world,
In jungle, mountain, desert plain, and fjord,
His music is eternal, and his skill
Is absolute, he is our gracious Lord.

w Mama left a legacy of happy memories for her family.
Our friends and relatives young and old loved to come to her gracious, hospitable home.
Some who knew Mama best said it was because she was generous, kind, and witty,
with a penchant for making every guest feel special and welcome. To this I wholeheartedly agree,
but Mama had something else which drew people to her.
Mama was an excellent cook. She liked nothing better than to share her cuisine with those she loved.

Unfortunately for her daughters, Mama never used a recipe. All of her dishes were concocted by feel,
consistency, or taste. A pinch of this or a handful of that. Mama didn't even own measuring cups or spoons.
One of the happiest memories Mama left her children was our annual trip to "the Lakes."
Mama prepared for several days for this special event. I can close my eyes now and it seems as though
I can almost taste some of her special goodies. As the tantalizing aroma from Mama's preparatory baking
permeated the air, it appeared that it touched off the appetite alarms of all the youngsters in our neighborhood,
and those children who came to our kitchen door never went away hungry.

For the long drive to "the Lakes," our outing site, Mama usually brought a lunch of milk, cinnamon buns,
or slices of raisin and nut bread spread with freshly churned butter. She would pack them in the folds
of snowy white dish cloths to keep them fresh, since wax paper or plastic wrap had never been heard of
in our town. There was always just enough food to appease our hunger but not too much to spoil
our appetites for the picnic to follow.

And what a picnic! Our favorite food was Mama's baked beans. Their cooking was an all-day process.
How we loved the smell of the molasses and brown sugar, mustard, and the salt pork nestled cozily among
the brown beans. Combined, they produced a flavor that was delectable. Homemade root beer was a must.
This was an exciting change from milk or the ever-popular lemonade. Mama's root beer had a special tang.

We all loved the bottling process and as we put the corks into the bottle tops and tied them securely
to the bottle with string, we would beg Mama to put our mark on just one bottle reserved especially for each of us.
In our home town, most everyone had at least a small garden. Fresh vegetables were common fare.
Mama said they were good for us and so she used them in every possible way. Happily, Mama had the knack
for giving even the lowest variety a special flavor. Pickled cucumbers were our special favorites,
so Mama always included them as part of our picnic menu.

Wheat was indeed the staff of life in our home.
Mama used it in a variety of ways. From a breakfast food which she simmered for hours on the back
of our coal range, to hot cakes, baking powder biscuits, buns, scones, to wonderful crusty homemade bread.
We loved to spread fat slices of this bread with cream skimmed from the milk pan and flavored with sugar,
or covered and dripping with honey or syrup. Long loaves of what we now call French bread were our favorite
for an outing.

What is so delightful as homemade ice cream?

No picnic or outing was complete in our family without it. Since Mama never counted calories, her ice cream was rich and delicious. The best and sweetest part was that which some lucky individual would lick from the dasher. Mama made many flavors and each kind we would avow to be our favorite. Try a delicious peach variety for your family. A dripper cake, usually Mama's special fudge cake recipe, completed our lunch. Even though we had eaten our fill we could never resist this special treat. Papa always concluded our picnics by arising to his feet and proclaiming that this picnic was the best ever. His only complaint being that he had eaten too much. Why did she make everything taste so good? Then, one by one, each one of Mama's children in his own way would echo Papa's words.

Many of you, like Mama's children, have treasured memories. Many of you, as we do, long for "Mama's" cooking. Why not plan a family outing and try these recipes or those you and your family enjoyed and remember so well? Several of the following recipes have been adapted from Mama's original ingredients and methods of preparation, and the other recipes included have been contributed by friends.

QF GRANDMA'S COOKIES

No one could make the cookies just like she could.
Some were soft and spicy, raisin filled,
Others were real crunchy, topped with sugar.
At making brownies she was highly skilled.
For holidays she used her special cutters:
Hearts, and stars, and chubby boys and girls,
Ginger, butterscotch, and plain vanilla,
Baked and trimmed with little frosting swirls.

Her cookie jar was very seldom empty,
She always seemed delighted when we'd come,
And what was best of all about her cookies,
She invited one and all to, "Please try some."

Of the big Wooden Churn.
Round and round
Went the Paddles inside,
and I could hear the sour Cream clogs
and forth as I imagined little
Pieces of utter beginning to form.

Soon Sister Carey removed the lid and paddles from the churn, and took
She fathered the cluster, and placed them in a bowl.
With a broad raddle carefully,
I laid the cardboard and butter in the small wire basket that was hooked
Securely to the handle bars of my bike.
As I started back down the road,
Summery rain clouds darkened,
And it sprinkled &s of water began
To dampen the earth.

Was glad I hurried as st 18S could pedal me
I held on to the handle bars tightly as I rode the ur blocks toward home, for I did 't want anything to happen to the Soft, Precious contents in the wire basket.
But appen it did

July 1969

Of blood were standing on the bruise as if it was a big decision as to whether they should stay on the surface or trickle down my leg. I was on the verge of tears when, suddenly, I saw the parchment paper, its contents splattered every which way in a mass of yellow ruin.
The tears that had gathered close to my eyelids flowed over the edge and down my face.
"Good old expensive stuff," I cried, as I saw that only a small amount of butter remained on the paper.
I picked it up ever so carefully and hoped with all my heart that it would be enough for supper.
"It's doubtful," I murmured to myself as I pushed the bike the remaining distance home.
"I'm sure this isn't enough for nine of us to share."

I parked the bicycle and walked slowly to the house wishing I was someone else's little girl, so I wouldn't have to go inside. But I wasn't someone else's; I was our own little girl, less and I opened up the door and stepped into the kitchen.
The table was set, and our family was starting to sit down; so no one noticed me for a minute.

"Here's the butter," I said in a sad, weak voice.
Mama was at the stove pouring the beans into a bowl.
"What kept you so long?" she asked, not looking around.
I walked over to her and stretched out my arm. The paper and butter, on the palm of my hand, were very close to her face.
She stepped back to avoid being smeared, and a trace of a frown appeared on her forehead as she raised one eyebrow slightly.
Then looking at me, all tearstained and skinned, she said with the real concern of a loving mother,
"You've had an accident."
She began immediately to examine my knee. "It isn't too bad—go and wash up," and she gave me a hug as she took the butter.
"Will there be enough for supper?" I asked anxiously as I dried my hands.
Mama looked at the contents on the parchment. It appeared to be clean, so she carefully scraped it into the butter dish.

"Yes, I'm sure there is enough," she reassured me, kindly, and going to the table, she set the dish by the bread.
I slipped quietly into my place as Mama sat down on her chair.
"There are plenty of beans, cool milk, fresh warm bread, and a jar of strawberry jam," she said after we had said the blessing on the food,
"So there will be no need for any of us to use more than just a dab of butter tonight."
Everyone smiled, and I was ever so glad that I wasn't someone else's little girl.

Her Hobby Is Writing
@ Bertha Anderson Kleinman, Mesa, Arizona, has brought distinction to herself, to her State, and to the Church through her well-developed and useful hobby of writing.
Her verbal architecture encompasses many fields, from prose and poetry to hymn lyrics and pageants.
Her childhood home was situated on the rim of the north bench adjacent to City Creek Canyon in Salt Lake City. On this commanding location, her father erected a pretentious home for those times.
Here Bertha grew to womanhood among orchards of fruitful and beautiful trees, lilac hedges, shrubbery, and terraced lawns.
She watched the sun rise over the magnificent rugged Wasatch Range and watched it set in splendor over the great inland sea to the west.
The ever-changing beauties of the Rockies lent color and majesty to her poetic nature and influenced her writing of the glowing tributes to the great western empire of which she is so much a part.

About her writing, Sister Kleinman says:
"If anything that I have written can help someone else, that is my favorite."
Primary children love to sing her well-known "I Have Two Little Hands."

Soon after her marriage to Orson Kleinman, she moved to Arizona and became one of the most prominent literary women of that area.
She has been described as an outstanding citizen and Church member.
In 1957, the Governor of Arizona proclaimed November 3rd as Bertha Kleinman day in recognition of her many published works regarding the State of Arizona.
She earned the title "Poet Laureate of Arizona."
She received the David O. McKay Humanities award at commencement exercises at Brigham Young University in 1958, largely in honor of the pageant "The Message of the Ages," a literary memorial to 100 years of Mormonism, perhaps the best known of her works.
She updated the text in 1947 to include the pioneers coming into the valley. This pageant was produced every night for six weeks in the Tabernacle on Temple Square.

Sister Kleinman was honored by the King of Denmark for her writings about the land of her ancestry.
Her writings have appeared many times in The Relief Society Magazine, and in the other Church publications, and she has had a book of poetry published which is now sought after as a collector's item.
At the age of ninety-three, she continues to write lovely and moving poetry.

Her six children and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren revere her and are proud of the rich heritage of her written words. Always a devoted Relief Society worker, she was recently honored by the Relief Society of the East Mesa Stake for her untiring service and dedication.

523 Budget Decorating

From earliest history woman has endeavored to decorate, as elegantly as possible, the walls that surround herself and family. And of all the mural treatments developed through the years, tapestry has generally been rated as the most magnificent. Fantastically intricate and expensive, tapestries usually occupied a place of honor in the homes of royal and wealthy families and were prominently displayed at important public occasions.

While you may not wish to apprentice for twelve to fifteen years (the usual learning time) in order to weave one square yard of tapestry in about a year's time, you may still appreciate the effects of fabric on your wall. Modern technology can help you! If your decor is the now-popular Spanish, select a large terry bath towel—one of those richly colored, highly-sculptured ones—for a hallway or appropriate space under which you can place a heavy reed basket or old trunk, repainted. An attractive and most effective duo.

Kitchen terry towels hold promise, too, in creating a tapestry effect that may blend with early American or "modern kitchen." Fruit and flower designs are plentiful. Printed fabrics, padded and quilted, may be hung as tapestries, and panels of sample drapery—with large classic print design—may even be utilized in the traditional bedroom or living room by the mural-minded. Or you may sew twill tape loops to a foam-backed bath mat, as pictured, and hang it from an inexpensive curtain rod or dowel. Here the motif is repeated underneath in a made-at-home flower tree of matching blue and green plastic roses. These are held in place by a three-inch styrofoam ball on a one-half inch dowel and secured in plaster of Paris. The tub is plastic. This combination can be made in an hour for less than $5. Just right for the bathroom or kitchen.

Use your imagination, and let modern looms work wonders for your walls. You won't have a Flemish masterpiece, true. You won't even have a real tapestry (which can only be made by a unique and intricate weaving method) but your home can benefit nonetheless from the centuries'-old tapestry touch.

WINGED PEACE

At the feeder swinging in fringed light a hummingbird and a bee drink together. A breeze rocks the branch, but sound only catches swooping wings, a dizzy buzz. The bee stitches back over ivy geranium. The bird is a blur of suspension, is gone. Small presence. Small absence but the rearrangement of air is a patch of pleasure on a drowsy afternoon.

525 HEART Room For Home Alice Morrey Bailey Chapter 2 SYNOPSIS: Mary Ann and Kim Freeman take Kim's father from his home in Mayville, Utah, to their home in Los Angeles to care for him after an accident, in which his hip has been broken. His coming will constitute an upheaval in their way of living, as Mary Ann will have to break her contract as a teacher in order to care for him. This will halve their income at the crucial time when their last two unmarried children are dependent on it—Tommy for his last year in college and Rosemary for her wedding, both events the following June. It is now October.

The parents are apprehensive about Rosemary's _ reaction, especially, as she has a demanding personality.

@ Rosemary was her charming best throughout the slow process of the dinner after they had made her grandfather comfortable—and he sparkled under her attention.

"Grandfather, is my little grotto still there?" "Yes, honey. The grandchildren play there by the hour."

"But you made it for me, didn't you? Chisled it out of pure rock." "Indeed I did, but the water had done most of it. It was yours before it was anybody else's."

Rosemary dimpled with pleasure. "You know when they had those adorable, ugly troll dolls? My college friends couldn't imagine why I collected them. It was so I could take them there and put them in their own setting, and someday I mean to."

It was Tommy who volunteered his room for his grandfather, as Mary Ann hoped he would. "Because it is closest to the bathroom," and moved his things to the one vacated by Robert, which they had used as a guest room since, while Rosemary made the bed ready for her grandfather.

"Such willing hands!" said their grandfather. "I feel as if I had dropped into a bed of roses. Everybody is so nice to me, and I don't know why—a useless old man."

"Grandpa!" Tommy and Rosemary protested in unison. "You could be useless forty years and not live up your credit," Tommy went on.

"How I loved my summers with you in Mayville!" "That's real nice of you children to say," said Father Freeman, "but mind you, stop me if I get to repeating myself. I've taken to reminiscing and I forget things, tell things over and over, can't remember what I've done and haven't done. I have to keep a list, I'm so old."

"Dad, I do the same things," put in Kim.

"Well, you're not so young yourself," said his father, looking at him astutely. "This doddering of the mind is a terrible trial to the young."

"He's a darling!" pronounced Rosemary when they got back to the living room. "He looks like an angel with that shock of white hair."

"I had forgotten what a beautiful old man Grandfather is," said Tommy.

"But he's so pale he looks ethereal. Is anything else wrong with him—besides the hip?" "He is in remarkable condition, except for his heart. It could go any time, the doctor says, but with good care he can walk again."

"With good care," said Rosemary, the little frown appearing between her brows. "What I want to know is."

"How's Cary?" demanded Mary Ann suddenly, to head off the inevitable showdown. Cary Marks was Rosemary's adored and adoring fiancé, a tall, clean-limbed young man, dark and handsome in contrast to her titian loveliness.

"Cary's a doll," said Rosemary, her mouth softening. "He helped me with dinner, getting the groceries. He's going to be a wonderful husband, but I told him to vamoose. I knew you'd be home, and that you would be tired."

"How thoughtful of you, dear, and we are tired. Exhausted, and we're going to bed this minute." "I didn't know then that Grandfather...." "How are Robert and Heidi? Have you heard from James? How are the girls?" Mary Ann interposed quickly.

If Rosemary had a night to get used to her grandfather's presence, maybe the impact would dissipate. Tomorrow was Sunday. It might even get lost in the rush of Church duties.

You are diverting me," accused Rosemary. "Barbara and Hank wanted to come and be here when you came, but I vetoed that, too. So did Jennifer and Dick—but all those little kids!" Jennifer's five were lively and noisy. Barbara's were older.

Robert had to fly to New York for his company—they might go there to live—so Heidi went with him. It was a good chance for a vacation, with only her fare to pay. Heidi's mother is staying with the children."

"To New York to live!" said Kim. "That will be a step up for Robert won't it." 527

Ary Ann Finning thought it was just "It has been a good having them and lenine and near. If they move to New York, we'll never set to see them."

I was about to take him the principal. Byt in San Francisco We rarely noticed that he did all right seeing his family," When I de verbal] assignments.

"Tommy knows." Waited Mary Ann. And it puzzled me. All at once "Distances are nothing, nowait needed on. He can't see days," consoled Kim. "These the board!" Young ones flit around with more than you used to how smart! And fase than you used to how "Compassionate! What did it from one town to another." You do?" "Cary and Jen Way. His parents were dumnifer and Dick are talking of founding. My star pupil going to Wall. He has an offer at Church College," "I'm thrilled, you know, I" Don't talk about it," said Mary Ann always feel there are no bad children. "What about other bad situations the school, Rosemary?" Not at that case, anyway.

Rosemary had been her informant. Ommey was silent, but he had experienced, as he had verified in the fourth grade while he had verified in the fourth grade while he had verified in the fourth grade while he had verified in the fourth grade while he had verified in the fourth grade while he had verified in the fourth grade.

She had been one, having graduated late to get into Susie's too late to get "Tommy, you're making a contract for him, but she nearly pigs us. Do you take advantage of it?" "Yes," admitted Tommy. "Why don't we start" said Kim. "His thesis quarter is coming up and want to concentrate on having a perfect wedding." Notes, but it has been over-explored now. I am open to Mary Ann's surprise Rosemary's suggestions this might be Mary brightened at the mention of things other than school. Admit, on] bad situations "Mary, you know now that or what you did, sis, 'The Role of the Teacher' and 'Above and Beyond the Call of Duty.' Three found out what was the matter pec. Earlier today, watching with him? You and Cary, I almost decided "You didn't! I felt he had on 'Bridal Ossiness Before Problem,' but didn't have time to get into it before we left. What happened to Phyllis and Melba?" queried Mary Ann. "I thought they were nice girls." "Dream-boats, both of them," said Tommy. "But they wanted to get married. I didn't."

"I hope, Tommy," said Kim, "that you are not like Kipling; 'The more I see of the lot of them, the less I am settled to one.' " "The young man hunting a straight stick in the forest? No, Dad, when I am ready, she will be there—the straightest one of them all." "I hope," said Mary Ann, "that you don't get any of them into your heart room for home fall in love with you, then leave them to pine after you." "They'll survive," said Tommy callously. "You should have seen the 'Dear John's' my companions in the mission field received."

"Maybe that should be your thesis subject," observed Rosemary. "Most of my studies have been on geriatrics. It intrigues me. Grandfather, now."

"What about grandfather?" demanded Rosemary. "What I want to know, if he has to have so much good care, is how is he going to get it here? How long is he going to stay?"

She was looking at her father. He looked at Mary Ann. Here it was! "I'm going to take care of him," said Mary Ann. "How can you, with your job?" "I have to break my contract. Monday." "Just like that?" "There wasn't any other way out, Rosemary." "Couldn't Aunt Emily or Aunt Francine have taken grandfather? At least until summer?"

"They thought otherwise," said Kim. "They wanted to sell the place and put your grandfather in a rest home."

"Sell the place!" said Rosemary and Tommy in unison. This reaction, so like their own, was at least heartwarming to Kim and Mary Ann.

"I often describe grandfather's setup in class, an almost totally self-containing unit—the cows, the chickens, and garden feed the table and the table feeds the pigs. The pigs and extra produce go to market. One blissful round of living."

"In the older days," said Kim, "you added a few sheep and got your clothing and bedding out of it, with rabbit brush, indigo, and madder root for dyes." "Somebody ought to write all that down," said Rosemary. "I love old things."

"I remember!" said Tommy, his eyes sparkling. "Grandmother washed the wool, picked the burrs out of it, carded it into bats and made quilts. She even made her own soap—with lye and old fat." "Her mother made her own lye, out of leached wood ashes. The early pioneers didn't have to buy a thing. They grew cane and made their own molasses, spun the fleece into yarn, and wove their own homespun, even grew cotton, and raised silk worms and made silk. I've seen samples in the museums."

"How long is grandfather going to stay?" repeated Rosemary stubbornly.

"We don't know," said her father.

"What about my wedding?" pursued Rosemary. "And Tommy's thesis quarter?"

"Let me worry about my own affairs, sis," said Tommy.

"I wasn't thinking of the changes it would make in our lives when I invited your grandfather—or the burden it would put on your mother," Kim said. "Neither was I," said Mary Ann. "If you had been there, Rosemary, if you had seen your grandfather, with all of us talking as if he wasn't there, the 530 tears coming down his face in spite of his efforts not to show his weakness—his physical weakness. He is proud and independent. I was proud of your father when he told him the place would never be sold—not in Grandfather's or ours." "And I was glad to hear from your mother her true feelings about her job. I had felt all along she was just saying she liked it to make us feel better about her working." "That's all very fine," said Rosemary somewhat bluntly. "But now what about my wedding? Obviously, both of you forgot about that." Rosemary was right. They had forgotten their children in the emotion-charged scene. The full brunt of their impulsive invitation had not hit them until later. Right now, as a matter of fact, Tommy had depended on his mother for his tuition and books, no small matter at this point in his education, and Rosemary had every reason to expect a lovely wedding, on the basis of their combined income. "Well, honey, we'll out," Kim said vaguely. Mary Ann realized now that she had shielded Kim in the matter of money, rushing forth with her funds whenever something above his ability to provide was needed. How could he realize the difference her salary had made in their plane of living? All the fringe items not officially listed with utilities, groceries, and house payments, the deluxe station wagon which had come into use bringing making his father home, the luxuries of finer clothes, a bigger four-bedroom home, including the swimming pool, extra gas and expense money for all of them. "We just have to play it by ear," he finished lamely. "I don't like ear music," said Rosemary succinctly. "Or hadn't you noticed? I like to play it as it's written—and it wasn't written this way. It is obvious that my wedding is not important to you." She went into her room and closed the door with a definite bang. Mary Ann rose to follow her. "Don't go, Mother," advised Tommy. "She has to think this thing through," but Mary Ann went anyway, entering Rosemary's room after a slight, unanswered knock. Rosemary was on her stomach on the bed. "Rosemary dear! If you'd been there! If you had seen how it was, with your aunts determined to sell the place and put the old dear into a rest home. He had been in a nursing home for a month after the hospital, and he couldn't bear it. 'Old people!' he said. 'Nothing but old people! And spaghetti one day, macaroni the next!' Your father and I couldn't bear to see your wonderful grandfather shunted off in his old age, to force him to sell his home—his whole life." "I'd really rather be alone," said Rosemary, without turning over. "I have some retirement coming, Rosemary. Not a great deal, but you can have that for your wedding." "What exactly do you take me for?" demanded Rosemary, sitting up. "Your retirement is for your own old age! Now, really, Mother. I'd like to be alone."

The Doctrine and Covenants Lesson 97—Eternal Marriage Elder Roy W. Doxey (Reading Assignment: Doctrine and Covenants, Sections 131:1-4; 132.)

Northern Hemisphere: First Meeting, October 1969 Southern Hemisphere: March 1970

OBJECTIVE: The Latter-day Saint woman should understand the truth that a marriage to endure after this life must be performed in a house of the Lord, and seek to attain. An eternal marriage.

INTRODUCTION In conversation with Elder William Clayton, the Prophet Joseph Smith told him what is now recorded in verses 1 through 4 of Section 131 of the Doctrine and Covenants pertaining to marriage. Section 132 is the revelation on celestial marriage, which includes plural marriage as well as eternal marriage. It is believed that the revelation on plural marriage was received as early as 1831, but Section 132 was committed to writing on July 12, 1843. (Joseph Smith, History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Vol. 5, p. xxxi [commonly called Documentary History of the Church; hereafter referred to as DHC].) Inasmuch as the Lord by revelation has withdrawn the practice of plural marriage, it is only necessary to mention the principle in this lesson. (The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff, pp. 213-18.) It is well to remember that this practice is proper only when the Lord commands it. (D&C 49:15-17; Joseph Fielding Smith, Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, pp. 323-24; Jac. 2:27-30.) The penalty for practicing plural marriage by a member of the Church today is excommunication, the same as for others who commit adultery. (Joseph F. Smith, Gospel Doctrine, p. 280.) Exaltation in the celestial kingdom requires eternal marriage but does not require plural marriage. In the revelation regarding eternal marriage, the expression "if a man marry a wife," or a similar expression, is used. (D&C 132:15, 18, 19, 26, 41.) IN THE BEGINNING In the beginning God ordained that marriage should be a part of earth experience for his sons and daughters. The following reveals that truth and also that this principle was intended as a part of the plan of salvation: And again, verily I say unto you, that whoso forbiddeth to marry is not ordained of God, for marriage is ordained of God unto man. Wherefore, it is lawful that he should have one wife, and they twain shall be one flesh, and all this that the earth might answer the end of its creation: And that it might be filled with the measure of man, according to his creation before the world was made. (D&C 49:15-17.) In discussing the marriage of Adam and Eve, Elder Harold B. Lee, of the Council of the Twelve, referred to its perpetuity, as follows: Here [Genesis 2:18, 22-24] was a marriage performed by the Lord between two immortal beings, for until sin entered the world their bodies were not subject to death. He made them one, not merely for time, nor for any definite period; they were to be one throughout the eternal ages. If you were to say that because Adam and Eve transgressed and became subject to death that this eternal union was broken, then just remember that the purpose of the atonement by Jesus Christ was to restore that which was lost by the fall. Their restoration then to each other after the resurrection would not require a re-marriage, for death to them was not a divorce; it was only a temporary separation. Resurrection to immortality meant for them a reunion and an eternal bond never again to be severed. "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive." (I Corinthians 15:22.) (Harold B. Lee, Youth and the Church, p. 128.) Lesson Department PURPOSE OF MARRIAGE There are some churches which maintain that celibacy is sanctioned by God. One of these churches in the days of the Prophet Joseph Smith was the Shaking Quakers. It was to a group of Latter-day Saint missionaries that the Lord revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith, that marriage was ordained of him and that those who taught otherwise did not represent him. (D&C 49:15.) Marriage makes it possible for the earth to answer the end of its creation. Because man, as a premortal being, was designed to come to earth to work out his salvation, marriage was ordained to bring about this purpose. Consequently, the fundamental purpose of marriage is to beget children that the Lord's purposes may be fulfilled. (D&C 49:16-17.) MARRIAGE OUTSIDE OF THE CHURCH Should a Latter-day Saint young man or woman marry someone who is not a member of the Church? Leaders of the Church have counseled members to marry within the Church. (Discourses of Brigham Young, pp. 196-97; Joseph F. Smith, Gospel Doctrine, p. 279; David O. McKay, Gospel Ideals, p. 465.) Where the parties to a marriage are both strong in different faiths, the chances for happiness are greatly diminished. (John A. Widtsoe, Evidences and Reconciliations, pp. 237-38.) Sometimes young people feel that when they marry a nonmember, he or she will be able to convert him or her to the Church. July 1969 The chances for conversion and the consequent happiness in marriage are far greater if the conversion is made before marriage. (Harold B. Lee, Youth and the Church, p. 132.) The Lord has said that parents should teach their children correct principles to shape their lives for happiness. (D&C 68:25-28.) The mother has a wonderful opportunity in the home to impress upon her children the importance of marrying within the Church. Class Discussion How and when should a mother prepare her children for temple marriage? PURPOSE OF LIFE To work out one's salvation in this life and in the life to come is the paramount purpose of earth life. This means that the purpose of God in creating man is to grant to him, through obedience, the greatest measure of salvation—eternal life. (Moses 1:39.) As man is the child of God, so also man may, by obedience to law, become as the Father. (D&C 132:20-22.) The blessing of eternal life comes to those who fulfill all the laws and commandments. OBEDIENCE TO THE GOSPEL The gospel of Jesus Christ provides the way whereby the sons and daughters of God may return—to his presence in the celestial kingdom. Baptism is the gate to that kingdom. (D&C 76:50-53.) There are degrees in the celestial kingdom, therefore, members of his Church should seek for the highest degree. In the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees; And in order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order or priesthood [meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage]; And if he does not, he cannot obtain it. He may enter into the other, but that is the end of his kingdom; he cannot have an increase. (D&C 131:1-4.) The new and everlasting covenant is the gospel of Jesus Christ. There are many covenants within the gospel and marriage for eternity is one of them. To be fully obedient to the gospel involves full discipleship. ETERNAL MARRIAGE After a couple have received the higher ordinances of the priesthood endowment in the temple, they are qualified to receive eternal marriage. Only by the keys of the priesthood held by the President of the Church, who delegates these powers to others, may this union be solemnized.

(D&C 132:7.) The blessings available to those who marry for eternity are these: they shall pass by the angels, and the gods, which are set there, to their exaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their heads, which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever. (D&C 132:19.) ETERNAL INCREASE In Section 131 and in Section 132, verse 19, the Lord has told us that if faithful to the eternal marriage vows, the blessing of "increase," and "a continuation of the seeds forever and ever" will be received. The Prophet Joseph Smith gave the following information on this subject: Except a man and his wife enter into an everlasting covenant and be married for eternity, while in this probation, by the power and authority of the Holy Priesthood, they will cease to increase when they die; that is, they will not have any children after the resurrection. (DHC, Vol. 5, p. 391.) The children born to an exalted man and woman after the resurrection are spirit beings. The parents are tangible, resurrected persons referred to in the scriptures as having spiritual bodies; that is, with spirit element in their veins rather than blood as in mortal bodies. (D&C 88:27; Alma 11:45; Brigham Young, Discourses of Brigham Young, p. 374.) THE DEATHS When resurrected beings are exalted they receive "eternal lives," the power of eternal increase, which is the opposite of the "deaths," or the lack of such power. (D&C 132:24-25.) Only exalted beings will be married in the future life because they proved themselves while on the earth in being faithful to all things required of them. (D&C 132:12.) In the following verses the conditions in the world to come are explained, having reference to those who receive marriage for eternity and to others who did not subscribe to the full law: Therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry her not by me nor by my word, and he covenant with her so long as he is in the world and she with him, their covenant and marriage are not of force when they are dead, and when they are out of the world; therefore, they are not bound Lesson Department by any law when they are out of the world. Therefore, when they are out of the world they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but are appointed angels in heaven, which angels are ministering servants, to minister for those who are worthy of a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal weight of glory. For these angels did not abide my law; therefore, they cannot be enlarged, but remain. Separately and singly, without exaltation, in their saved condition, to all eternity; and from henceforth are not gods, but are angels of God forever and ever. (D&C 132:15-17.) If there are some who may believe that their marriage is in effect beyond the grave, although not solemnized by God's priesthood in the temple, the following verse corrects this belief: And again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife, and make a covenant with her for time and for all eternity, if that covenant is not by me or by my word, which is my law, and is not sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, through him whom I have anointed and appointed unto this power, then it is not valid neither of force when they are out of the world, because they are not joined by me, saith the Lord, neither by my word; when they are out of the world it cannot be received there, because the angels and the gods are appointed there, by whom they cannot pass; they cannot, therefore, inherit my glory; for my house is a house of order, saith the Lord God. (D&C 132:18.) Class Discussion How does our desire to project our family relationship into eternity motivate our desire to attain the celestial kingdom? MARRIAGE IN THE RESURRECTION In reference to a question concerning marriage of a woman to several husbands, the Savior said that "in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven." (Matt. 22:30.) What did the Lord mean when he said that there was no marrying in the resurrection? He was speaking of the Sadducees who had rejected the gospel and its teachings about eternal marriage. As far as they were concerned, there was no marrying or giving in marriage in heaven. But if the persons are worthy to be married for eternity, and the opportunity does not come while on the earth, the opportunity for this blessing will come in the world ahead. The necessary ordinances may, for instance, be performed on the earth in a temple by proxy. What of Latter-day Saint daughters who have died without being sealed to a man in the temple? Elder Melvin J. Ballard gave this counsel: Now, then, what of your daughters who have died and have not been sealed to some man? Unless it is made known to you, let their case rest. They will make known to you the agreements and contracts they have mutually entered into. The sealing power shall be forever and ever with this Church, and provisions will be made for them. We cannot run faster than the Lord has provided the way. Their blessings and privileges will come to them in due time. In the meantime, they are safe. (Bryant S. Hinckley, Sermons and Missionary Services of Melvin J. Ballard, p. 260.) Elder Ballard also gives an answer to the same question concerning little children who, of course, did not receive the sealing ordinance of marriage: I lost a son six years of age, and I saw him a man in the spirit world after his death, and I saw how he had exercised his own freedom of choice and would obtain of his own will and volition a companionship, and in due time to him, and all those who are worthy of it, shall come all of the blessings and sealing privileges of the house of the Lord. Do not worry over it. They are safe; they are all right. (Ibid.) What about young men and women who die without the opportunity for marriage in the temple? Elder Harold B. Lee has said: You young women advancing in years who have not yet accepted a proposal of marriage, if you make yourselves worthy and ready to go to the house of the Lord and have faith in this sacred principle, even though the privilege of marriage does not come to you now, the Lord will reward you in due time and no blessing will be denied you. You are not under obligation to accept a proposal from someone unworthy of you for fear you will fail of your blessings.

Likewise you young men who may lose your lives in a terrible conflict before you have had an opportunity for marriage, the Lord knows the intents of your hearts and in his own time will reward you with opportunities made possible through temple ordinances instituted in the Church for that purpose. (Harold B. Lee, Youth and the Church, p. 132.)

Many women join the Church although their husbands may not. What of them? Salvation is an individual matter. If one party to the marriage remains true to the covenant of baptism and the opportunity for eternal marriage is not possible, then the righteous desires of that person's heart will eventually be realized.

Class Discussion
In view of the foregoing discussion, why do you think the gospel of Jesus Christ is just?

BLESSINGS OF TEMPLE MARRIAGE
Experience has shown that those who marry in the temple generally find success in their marriage. Elder John A. Widtsoe gave the following nine reasons for a temple marriage:
1. It is the Lord's desire and will.
2. It is in harmony with the sacred nature of the marriage covenant.
3. It tends to insure marital happiness.
4. It permits the association of husband-and-wife for time and for all eternity.
5. It provides the eternal possession of children and family relationship.
6. It acts as a restraint against evil.
7. It furnishes the opportunity for endless [eternal] progression.
8. It places the family under the protection of the power of the priesthood.
9. It provides a God-like destiny for human beings.

(John A. Widtsoe, Evidences and Reconciliations, pp. 231-36.)

HAPPY HOMES
The performance of the marriage ceremony in the temple is not sufficient in itself to make a happy home. President David O. McKay has given six elements which lie at the basis of true home building:
1. Let us substitute the present tendency toward a low view of marriage with the lofty view which God gives.
2. Teach the young of both sexes in the responsibilities and ideals of marriage so that they may realize that marriage involves obligation and is not an arrangement to be terminated at pleasure.
3. Instruct young girls in the fundamental arts of housekeeping, so that when responsibilities of wifehood come, they may be free from the difficulties and perplexities which arise from ignorance and inexperience.
4. Marriages should be solemnized, as far as possible, in the house of God.
5. Keep religion in home life.
6. Teach the young that the foundations of a happy home are laid before even the bride and bridegroom kneel at the marriage altar.

(David O. McKay, Gospel Ideals, pp. 478-79.)

LESSON DEPARTMENT
IMPLEMENTATION
In the premortal world the plan of salvation was formed whereby the spirit sons and daughters of God could receive an earth life necessary for eternal progression. The relationship between God and his children was a parent-child relationship because his spirit children were born of a Heavenly Father and Heavenly Mother.

(Harold B. Lee, Youth and the Church, pp. 126-27.)

The eternal round of spirit children being born to exalted beings and the opportunity to reach the heights of exaltation by an earth life require marriage for eternity by mortals. Faithfulness to eternal marriage covenants is a means of proving oneself as a part of the eternal plan.

Marriage was instituted by God for the purpose of bringing to earth life his spirit children for this probationary state. Exaltation is possible only to male and female together.

(Joseph F. Smith, Gospel Doctrine, p. 276.)

Marriage is so essential to salvation in the highest sense that provision is made in the gospel that those who do not have the opportunity in life for eternal marriage may have the blessing of temple ordinances by proxy. Latter-day Saint parents have the responsibility of teaching their children the principles of the gospel in order that they may be prepared for marriage in the temple. They know that success in marriage is enhanced greatly by eternal marriage and that only when sealed by the priesthood of God can contracts remain unbroken when men are dead.

TRUTHS TO LIVE BY (Correlated With the Family Home Evening Manual, 1968-69)

Message 1—In the Service of Your Fellow Men

Alice Colton Smith
Northern Hemisphere: First Meeting, October 1969
Southern Hemisphere: March 1970

OBJECTIVE:
To realize that when we serve our fellow beings, we are in the service of our God.

A few years ago a group was discussing the meaning of service. One said, "I'm a business man. Everything I manufacture and sell is to help others have a better life." A teacher said, "My whole day is devoted to helping others develop." A mother said, "I gave birth and thus life to a number of people and I serve them." A lawyer said, "A public servant is well named. An elected official serves others."

Centuries before this, King Benjamin called all his people together to teach them the will of God. In his memorable address he said:
"And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God."

(Mosiah 2:17.)

What was he saying about service in this verse and the following verses of his speech? Did he mean what the businessman, the teacher, the lawyer, even the mother did, or was he speaking of something beyond the general goodness that people may extend to one another and for which they often receive remuneration and other earthly rewards?

Jesus said:
"Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day: Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name have cast out devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works? (italics added.)
And then will I profess unto them: I never knew you....(3 Ne. 14:21-23.)

And again Jesus said, "For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? Do not even the publicans the same?"

(Matt. 5:46.)

In these teachings is God not calling us to a more profound meaning of loving service? Is it enough just to take care of others we love? Do not sinners do the same?

In his early instructions to the Relief Society, Joseph Smith said that one of the purposes of the society was in "Searching after objects of charity and in administering to their wants."

(History of Relief Society, 1842-1966, p. 18.)

Moreover, Jesus taught it was to be done so "That thine alms may be in secret."

(Matt. 6:4.)

Again Joseph Smith said, "Relief Society is not only to relieve the poor, but to save souls."

(Joseph Smith, History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Vol. 5, p. 25 [commonly called Documentary History of the Church; hereafter referred to as DHC}.)

Our service to our fellow men, then, has special meanings.

It is to be a part of serving God with our "whole souls" (Mosiah 2:21), to follow Jesus into total Lesson Department righteousness, and do the will of my [our] Father which is in heaven." (Matt. 7:21.) We should love and serve our enemies. We should search out those in need. We are not only to attend to their physical needs but to help them find the kingdom of God, to keep his commandments "that they might rejoice and be filled with love towards God and all men." (Mosiah 2:4.) We are to help them lift their lives to greater goodness, to help them achieve salvation. As we serve our fellow men, then, with these added dimensions, we are in the service of our God helping to bring about his multiple, great purposes.

HOMEMAKING�Development Through Homemaking Education
Woman's Role in Family Preparedness
Discussion 1�"She Looketh Well to the Ways of Her Household." (Prov. 31:27)
Celestia J. Taylor
Northern Hemisphere: Second Meeting, October 1969
Southern Hemisphere: March 1970

OBJECTIVE: To show the need for family preparedness and the role of the Latter-day Saint woman in achieving it.

INTRODUCTION
Have any of us ever known a period of time when our leaders have not counseled, advised, and even urged us to prepare our homes and families that we might be self-sustaining in a time of need? The answer would certainly have to be in the negative. Why, then, are many of us so reluctant or so indifferent, or even so negligent that we fail to heed this counsel? Is it because we have lulled ourselves into a state of false security by using excuses�excuses which 547 July 1969 we can usually find if we are looking for them?

WHAT ARE OUR EXCUSES?
1. That we are not converted. Can we justify ourselves when we accept some of the teachings of our leaders and reject others?
2. That we hear the counsel but we are not ready to heed it. Can we attain salvation without working for it?
3. That there is no immediate need. Illness, accident, strikes, destructive weather (earthquakes, tornadoes, etc.), and other disasters could occur at any time.
4. That we are protected by the Church storehouses. These supplies are only designed to meet needs that go beyond what the family is able to do for itself.
5. That we have inadequate storage space. If there is a will, there is a way to overcome this problem.
6. That spoilage of stored food results in a waste of money and effort. Do we criticize the program rather than the method when unwise planning and improper storing are responsible for our losses?
7. That we cannot afford the extra expense. Careful planning and wise manipulation of income will overcome this difficulty.

WHY SHOULD WE BE PREPARED?
If there were no other reason than that our Church leaders have so counseled us, it would be the best reason in the world for obeying. In a talk given at a Brigham Young University Leadership Week, Elder Harold B. Lee made the following statement: The only safety and security there is in this Church is in listening to the words that come from the prophets of the Lord, as if from the mouth of the Lord himself. And they have spoken; they have told us to prepare, and it is not for us to argue whether we should or whether 548 we should not. We have the prophets today telling us what our responsibility is here and now.... God help us not to turn deaf ears, but go out while the harvest is yet possible and build on a foundation such that when the rains descend, and the floods come, and the winds blow and beat on the house, our house will have stone walls. (BYU Leadership Week, June 16, 1953.)

President Tanner told of a conversation he had with a member of the Church regarding the importance of family preparedness. This person said "Well, you know, if I knew that this was going to happen next year, if that is when the emergency is going to take place, I would get mine in" �meaning the year's supply. President Tanner replied, "If IT were you I would wait for the emergency.... You remind me of the man who was complaining that he had been paying fire insurance for the last twenty years and he had never got anything out of it." (Welfare Conference, October 1, 1966.)

We pay fire insurance, certainly not hoping that some day our houses will burn down. We pay insurance on our lives hoping that we will long outlive the maturing of the policies. We take other precautions which we hope will insure us a happy and profitable life here on earth, and then we endanger it all by not heeding the warnings and counsel of our leaders regarding this most important phase of our living�preparedness.

President J. Reuben Clark gave us some wise and sound advice when he said: First, and above and beyond everything else, let us live righteously, fearing God and keeping his commandments.... [Second,] Let us avoid debt as we would a plague.... Let us straightly and strictly hve within our incomes, and save a little. Let every head of every household see to it that he has on hand enough food and clothing, and, where possible, fuel also, for at least a year ahead. (Conference Report, April 1937, p. 26.)

WHAT IS THE LATTER-DAY SAINT WOMAN'S ROLE?
In some instances women manage most of the family expenditures. Home management has become a business in itself. This intensifies our responsibility as Latter-day Saint wives and mothers in this important preparedness program. We need, first of all, to be entirely converted to it, and then we should �if we have not already done so�proceed in a systematic and orderly way to make the necessary preparation, as our incomes will permit, without borrowing or going into debt.

CONCLUSION
An increased sense of security and a deep feeling of peace fill our hearts when we know that we are obeying the counsel of the prophets of the Lord and when we know that by doing so we can take care of those we love in any emergency. Few of us have known an extremity of want or suffering, but those who have experienced even minor emergencies recognize the wisdom of being prepared.

SOCIAL RELATIONS�Immortality and Eternal Life
Lesson 1�Restraint�Road to Freedom, Part 1
Alberta H. Christensen (Reference: Immortality and Eternal Life, Vol. 2, Selections from the Writings and Messages of President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., Melchizedek Priesthood Course of Study. 1969-70, Lessons 6-7.)

Northern Hemisphere: Third Meeting, October 1969
Southern Hemisphere: March 1970

(Immortality and Eternal Life, Vol. 2, lesson 6.) 549 July 1969 These words of President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., spoken as early as 1933, reveal a situation which has become increasingly evident through succeeding years and is a vivid reality today. They lead us into the general discussion theme of this lesson, which will quote liberally from lessons 6 and 7 of the current Melchizedek Priesthood course of study. This companion lesson will discuss restraints as they relate to the individual, emphasizing the need for restraints in society and in one's personal relationships.

UNREST AND OPPOSITION

The attitude of unrest and opposition to established institutions, referred to by President Clark and so apparent throughout the world today, is giving parents, educators, and civic leaders much concern. They are considering probable causes and searching for remedies. Existing conditions convince us that no easy answer is available and that no generalization is adequate for the complex condition involving so many aspects.

President Clark states: Some may say this rebellion shows merely a wish for greater liberty; others may consider it a destructive demand for complete license. As frequently happens, neither extreme view seems wholly right. The truth probably lies somewhere between.

A list of probable factors related to this attitude of revolt follows. President Clark has suggested the first three, others have been added, and still others may be suggested. Our concern in this discussion is to discover some areas where the home may be abdicating important responsibilities.

Question for Discussion

In your opinion, which of the following probable factors seem most likely to be responsible for this personal revolt? Discuss as time permits.

1. A general desire for more liberty.
2. A destructive demand for complete license—freedom from restraint.
3. A personal weakness which may cause an individual to want others to become as he is or to share his point of view.
4. A lack of constructive objectives that give purpose to life.
5. A desire to be different.
6. A wish to escape responsibility.
7. A basic lack of understanding of the value of law and order and of the need for personal restraint even in situations where changes and dissent may be justified.
8. A sincere mistrust by many idealistic young people of what they consider to be the hypocrisy and artificiality of accepted standards.

Revolt for this reason, if recognized for the idealism it is and properly channeled, can be transformed into a force for good.

Ad Points to Consider

In the search for cause and cure, may we not justly turn the searchlight upon the homes from which these individuals—these restless resisters of law—have come? We may ask such pertinent questions as these:

1. Is it possible that restrictive demands within the home have been excessive, or has there been a complete lack of restraint?
2. Is it possible that an understanding acceptance within the home has been lacking so self-esteem has not been developed?
3. Have parents set the example of restraint by having definite life objectives? Have they motivated the children to do likewise?
4. A. Have the children been given freedoms in those areas where individuality is commendable?
   b. Have they been guided so as to be able to distinguish between that which is merely "different" and that which is fundamental?
5. Have the parents done too much for the children, thus depriving them of the strength and growth that responsibility develops?
6. Has the home neglected to teach the need for law and the fact that obedience to law and order brings freedom?
7. Has faith in God and general religious training been absent in the home?

RESTRAINTS—WHY?

Certain familiar virtues, when developed and exercised, make us good citizens and dependable, upright individuals. These virtues are basic to constructive private life and have been found to be essential to an orderly society as a whole. We may enumerate some of them in such affirmative terms as honesty, respect for life and property of others, or in the negatively expressed commandments of the Decalogue, such as, thou shalt not kill, nor steal, nor commit adultery.

President Clark states: These virtues are named because, looking at mankind as a whole and at the Christian nations particularly, these characteristics seem to be basic to their civilization. They seem to be equally basic to any form of orderly society of which we can conceive. For if every person murdered and robbed and lied and loafed and caroused, if there were an indiscriminate association of the sexes, no ordered society could exist; and without such society we have scant ground for hoping and no ground for believing that humanity could escape becoming merely animal.

Discussion Statements

If the foregoing statements are sound, organized society must establish some restraints and some conventions to assist in the enforcement of the restraints. President Clark states: Certainly some conventions and restraints must be retained; it is equally certain that others might be changed or abolished. The restraint which forbids murder may not be safely abandoned; the convention which prescribes the difference between dinner jacket and full evening dress might be forgotten.

RESTRAINTS—WHEN AND HOW MUCH?

How much restraint and what type of conventions needed for an orderly social unit to persist may depend upon (1) the persons or group of people affected, (2) the state of their civilization and righteousness. President Clark declares: The greater the civilization and righteousness which a person or a people shall possess, the less will be the need of restraint and convention.

Implementation

1. Relate the foregoing statement of President Clark with the following occasion and statement: When the Prophet Joseph Smith was asked how he governed the thousands of converts into the Church, he replied, "I teach the people correct principles and they govern themselves." (Cited by John Taylor, Journal of Discourses, Vol. 10, pp. 57-58 [hereinafter referred to as JD].)

2. Relate this principle to parental training within the home, answering this question: Can children, generally, be expected to perform better than their teaching or their knowledge?

INHERENT IN ALL CREATION

Speaking of universal laws, President Clark states: The great laws governing the universe—physical, intellectual, and spiritual—are coexistent with that universe as known to us; they are self-executory, that is, they enforce themselves; no one needs to enforce them; they operate independently of man's will, consent, or desire; they operate impartially and universally; every creature, human or animal, every other created thing, is subject to the applicable law. It follows that whether we wish or whether we do not wish restraint, yet restraint is inherent in all creation.

Efforts to ignore restraint, or to evade it, or to destroy it, will meet with failure.

The physical world is fully controlled by law; if it were not, it could not and would not exist. Heat, light, electricity, what we call matter—air, water, earth—all are subject to and controlled by law. Our bodies being matter are equally subject to great physical laws from none of which is there any escape.

551 July 1969

(Jbid., lesson 6.) Question: How can a mother make use of her knowledge of these immutable laws in the training of small children? President Clark suggests some practical illustrations for the operation of these physical laws. He continues: If we walk off a cliff, we fall. It is immaterial whether we know the cliff is there, or whether we know we will fall if we walk off, or whether we desire to fall, or whether we step off the cliff by one foot or jump off by five feet; the result is the same and inevitable. If we touch a hot stove, we are burned; ignorance of its heat, or an accidental touching, or our own preferences, or our lack of knowledge that hot stoves burn—all are immaterial. If we lay hold of a copper wire, heavily charged with electricity, we are killed; again neither ignorance nor accident nor preference will avail us. Acid burns our flesh, water drowns us, poison gas kills us. These results all come from the operation of laws which are immutable; they execute themselves; they do not depend either upon our knowledge of their existence, or upon our consent to their operation, or upon our desire that they manifest themselves; the penalty inevitably follows the violation.

(Ibid.) Discussion Questions: How may the relationship between the mother and child be affected if the mother (a) merely gives a negative command, (b) explains that a certain action will bring a certain result? Give examples. How would you answer the older child who asks: "But is there no exception? Does one always have to experience the penalty for violating the law?" One mother's reply: There is no exception unless some other law intervenes to soften or eliminate the penalty. For example, if a person wears asbestos gloves, he may be spared the burning effect of the hot stove. If a person steps off the cliff in a parachute, he may land safely upon the ground. The child, thus, gradually learns through experience and the verbal guidance of parent or other persons to walk freely and safely through many of the hazards of the physical world. He must, however, also learn—that this is a gradual process—that the effects of many physical laws must not be learned through personal experience, if he is to survive physically. He must not shoot himself to learn that a bullet shot from a gun can kill. From his close associates, especially the mother, the small child learns of many laws vicariously. He later may seek other authoritative sources.

Question: How can the mother establish a relationship that will build confidence in her judgment and admonition? Discuss briefly.

THE IMMEDIATE VERSUS THE DELAYED PENALTY The penalty for violation of the immutable laws may be immediate, as in the foregoing examples, or they may be delayed for months or even many years. It is not difficult for adults to know and to understand why this is so. It is, however, not always easy for them to keep the effects sufficiently in mind that they are willing to heed the warning effects of the law. It is far easier to comply with the restraints of the law when the penalty is in immediate sight. Would many persons yield to the habit of smoking if the possible cancer result were always an immediate penalty? For children, it is even more difficult to maintain interest in a far-away penalty.

Discussion Statement: The more mature a person becomes, the more willing he is to comply with the restraints of physical laws where the results are not immediate. There are innumerable laws in the physical world about which we know very little at present. It is to discover these laws and their effects that research science is making such great effort today, in extensive areas of life. Much has been discovered already.

We have centered our discussion, thus far, upon the immutable laws which affect our physical beings. "... It is inconceivable," LIFE'S AFTERNOON Lesson Department states President Clark, "that affairs of the mind and spirit of men, embracing the moral and spiritual world, are not also controlled by law." (Ibid.) (This aspect of the laws which affect our lives will be treated more fully in the succeeding lesson.)

We have focused our discussion thus far upon the effects of violating specific natural laws. We must not overlook the truth that obedience to the law brings affirmative rewards. President Clark phrases this idea beautifully in the following paragraph: On the other hand, the law operates just as certainly in its blessings as in its penalties. If we avoid the cliff, we do not fall; if we do not touch the stove, we are not burned; if we leave the charged electric wire alone, we are not injured. So in intellectual and spiritual matters: if we do not offend, we suffer no injury. But in intellectual and spiritual matters, obedience to law brings not only the blessings of mere absence of penalty, but it brings also, in every case, increased power and strength; it brings growth and development; it brings us nearer to the ultimate goal pronounced by the Master: "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." [Matt. 5:48.] And this truth is the wonder and the glory of our intellectual and spiritual lives.

(Ibid., lesson 7.) For Home Doing: Make opportunities to remind yourself and to teach your children that obeying the restraining laws of the universe is to walk the road of freedom—free from the penalties that violation brings, free to enjoy the rich blessings of obedience. No afternoon of life is colorless; all the brilliance of the setting sun reflects the golden memories of youth, and gilds the pathway toward the evening.

MUSIC. "Bianik" from Ma Vlast (My Fatherland) by Bedrich Smetana (1824-1884)

Commentary on musical selection by Clawson Cannon, Assistant Dean of College of Fine Arts, Brigham Young University. Through the ages as men have striven to be "... Free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon." (2 Ne. 3:26) they have yearned for personal and political freedoms. In the great nationalistic movements of the 19th century, artists, writers, and musicians did not really reflect the conditions of their time as much as they wrote on what they wished conditions were to be. Bedrich Smetana, in his later life, composed a series of six tone poems that beautifully expressed his love and hopes for his country. "The Moldau" is the best known of the six.

It is a musical description of the mighty river by that name which flows through the land. "Blanik" is the final poem of the series; it paints the hill located in the mid-southern region of Bohemia around which an old legend is built—a legend that tells of sleeping knights that will awaken to serve the country in time of need. Smetana has used as a theme for this work the old Hussite hymn, "Ye Are the Warriors of God." He wrote, "On the basis of this melody will develop the resurrection of the Czech people, its future happiness and glory."

554 INTRODUCTION TO LITERATURE LESSON

At its most basic level, man's freedom to choose, his "agency," is fundamental to all that he does. We are told in 2 Ne. 2:26 that the redemption of Christ makes men "... free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon." The selections which we are considering this month help us appreciate the range of choices we can exercise in establishing meaningful concepts of liberty.

"THE HIND AND THE PANTHER"
John Dryden's lines from his long poem entitled "The Hind and the Panther" emphasize the danger of trying to coerce others into a belief which matches our own:
The Hind and the Panther
Of all the tyrannies of human kind
The worst is that which persecutes the mind.
Let us but weigh at what offence we strike,
"Tis but because we cannot think alike.
In punishing of this we overthrow
The laws of nations and of nature too.
Beasts are the subjects of tyrannic sway,
When still the stronger on the weaker prey;
Man only of a softer mould is made,
Not for his fellows' ruin but their aid;
Created kind, beneficent and free,
The noble image of the Deity.

The final line of this excerpt—with its echo of Genesis 1:27—is intended to make explicit what has already been hinted at throughout the poem: only that man who remembers in whose image he is made can be expected to understand that coerced freedom of conscience is neither necessary nor beneficial.
John Dryden (1631-1700) was one of the most versatile of English poets. He seemed to be at home in dramatic, satiric, narrative, and didactic poetry. He was also one of the greatest of English translators and one of the most accomplished writers of English prose. In 1686 Dryden was converted to Roman Catholicism and "The Hind and the Panther," his most famous religious poem, is a defense of his new faith. The Hind apparently represents the Roman Catholic Church, while the Panther stands for the Church of England.

Discussion Question
If most of us know that man "convinced against his will is of the same opinion still," why do we still try to force conformity?

"THE INDISPENSABLE OPPOSITION"
Walter Lippmann (1889) was a member of the famous Class of 1910 at Harvard University. Since his graduation, he has had a distinguished career as a journalist, editor, and author. For members of the Church, Mr. Lippmann's insistence on the necessity of opposition strikes an immediately responsive chord.
In the second chapter of 2 Nephi we find the following lines:
"For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad." (2 Ne. 2:11.)
In reading Lippman's "The Indispensable Opposition" we
555 July 1969 must distinguish at once between that opposition which stems from mere contentiousness and that opposition which is creative.
The Book of Mormon warns us against contention in the eleventh chapter of 3 Nephi, verse 29:
"For verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.
One of the cues as to what is essentially wrong with contention is given in the phrase "with anger." Too often our opposition is expressed in emotional, exaggerated charges and counter-charges. In such a state we are not receptive to the whisperings of the Spirit. The Holy Ghost is not able to penetrate the wall of strong feeling which we have erected. We haven't ears to hear the truth.
A dispute is not even a detour toward truth; it becomes an end in itself, a dead end. We quickly become less concerned with finding answers than we are in winning arguments. How rarely anyone is listening in an argument. We wait impatiently while our opponent speaks so we can stun him with our side as soon as he finishes.
The opposition Mr. Lippmann finds "indispensable" has little to do with mere disputation. Rather, it is the presentation and consideration of alternatives that test and refine our own beliefs. Truth has nothing to fear from error and since the very word "definition" suggests pointing out that something is not as well as what it is, we can focus and sharpen
556 our perceptions by contrast as well as comparison.
It must be remembered, however, that Mr. Lippmann is talking primarily about secular truth. That to which the Spirit has testified to us is not illuminated by error.

Discussion Question
How can we usually tell when a fruitful discussion is turning into a fruitless disputation?

"WHAT IS LIBERTY?"
Woodrow Wilson, twenty-seventh President of the United States, in his essay "What is Liberty" presents an attractive picture of a harmonious society in which each part is adjusted to and balanced against every other one. It is important to remember, in reacting positively to such a concept, that such an adjustment might be temporarily attained where the basis for the social group is almost wholly evil, that is, men are mere cogs in a machine.

"ANIMAL FARM"
George Orwell's "Animal Farm" is a convincing and devastating satire on a communist attempt to make "all animals equal." There are few endings in English fiction as effective as the concluding paragraph of this novel. What is most heartrending is that, to the exploited animals who are gazing in astonishment at the violent argument going on between the pigs and men, whatever the outcome of the arguments, they are the

Discussion Question:
What is the basic difference between the harmony and adjustment we seek in an organization such as the Relief Society and that sought after in the grouping described in "Animal Farm"?

OTHER POEMS
Poems by Henry David Thoreau and James Oppenheim stress the importance of peace of mind and personal integrity in the meaning we can individually give to liberty. Of course, we must understand that the Latter-day Saint definition of liberty is in accord with the Lord's definition of liberty.

Thoreau's "Independence" is as follows:
My life more civil is and free
Than any civil polity.
Ye Princes, keep your realms and circumscribed power,
Not wide as are my dreams,
Nor rich as is this hour.
What can ye give which I have not?
What can ye take which I have got?
Can ye defend the dangerless?
Can ye inherit nakedness?
To a free soul—thank God—
Can help itself.

Be sure your fate
Doth keep apart its state,
Not linked with any band,
Even the noblest in the land,
In tended fields with cloth of gold
No place doth hold.
But is more chivalrous than they are, and sigheth for a nobler war;
A finer strain its trumpet rings,
A brighter gleam its armour flings.
The life that I aspire to live,
No man proposeth me;
557 July 1969
No trade upon the street
Wears its emblazonry.

Along with his friend and mentor Ralph Waldo Emerson, Thoreau believed strongly in a self-reliance which was, ultimately, a reliance upon God. The fervor of Thoreau in this poem seems out of place if we do not remember this. It is a little unfair to think of Thoreau as the great rebel in American literature and it is even more unfair to believe that the group of which Thoreau and Emerson were a part—the Transcendentalists—were characterized by personal eccentricity and harsh independence.

What all the Transcendentalists insisted upon was the necessity for each person to find out for himself what he believed in. They were sure that men of faith and good will would finally come to essential agreement, since God is the author of all truth but they felt strongly that each person must come to that unity in his own way.

In this poem Thoreau tries to reject all the crutches which men have tried to use to avoid facing the truth and establishing a personal liberty based on that truth. James Oppenheim's "The Slave" is equally committed to the necessity for each man to free himself before he can conceive the meaning of liberty.

Discussion Question:
According to the gospel, what is freedom and when is man free?

"The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky"
This selection by Stephen Crane has been praised as an implicit satire on an idealized West, as a major example of literary realism; or as simply a memorable story. Crane himself felt it was a "daisy" of a story. It is surely all of these but, in addition, few narratives equal its sensitive probing of the nature of freedom.

In Walter Lippmann's article we see the part played by opposition in clarifying liberty. In "The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky" we are helped to understand the necessary connection between freedom and responsibility. There is no talk of freedom in this tale. The characters we meet are not given to philosophizing, but their instinct is sure. Even Scratchy Wilson, blurred by whiskey and unfaltered rage, is sobered and calmed by Jack Potter's announcement that he is now married.

Lesson Department

No reason to believe that Jack will be less effective as a sheriff now that he has a wife but the order which he must now maintain will no longer be part of the game by which he has entertained the town. It is an indication of the refining influence of women in the development of the rugged west.

Under the press of responsibility we are tempted to equate freedom with lack of obligations. Children, however, know better. How anxious they are to leave the circumscribed sphere of childhood for the choices of an adult world. If we lose some of a child's careless zest in growing up, we trade it gladly for the enlarged positions of husband, wife, father, mother.

As Lehi reminds us, a Garden of Eden universe is static.
(2 Ne. 2:22-23.)
In the right to choose we prepare ourselves for eternal liberty.

Discussion Question:
Too much responsibility may not prove compatible with freedom. How can we establish the proper balance?

BRIGHT ECHO
watched a gull fly low
Across the sky,
Just where the sunset,
Mirrored in the lake,
Caused all its beauty
To intensify.
Alone, where rosy ripples
Raced to break,
Its bright wings echoed
In the lake's reply,
Flew its reflected self,
In splendor's wake,
And seemed the mystic
Flight to glorify.
