Our Children— "The Loveliest Flowers From God's Own Garden" President Joseph Fielding Smith Of the First Presidency [Address Delivered at the Officers Meeting of the Relief Society Annual General Conference, October 2, 1968] 

My dear sisters: I am very happy to be here with you today, and I hope and pray that what I might say will be of benefit to one and all. There are certain old truths which will be truths as long as the world endures, and which no amount of progress can change. One of these is that the family (the organization consisting of father, mother, and children) is the foundation of all things in the Church; another, that sins against pure and healthy family life are those which, of all others, are sure in the end to be visited most heavily upon the nations in which they take place. So, we must work for all around us, but especially for those closest and nearest, as the best possible preparation for doing our duty in the Church.

But each of you, as mothers, can strive—at least as light and strength are given you—toward the ideal home where there must exist a perfect companionship between parents and children, built upon the feeling of mutual interest, knowledge, taste, and sympathy. Far more important than the question of occupation or wealth of people is the question of how their family life is conducted. All other things are of minor consequence, so long as there are real homes, and so long as those who make up these homes do their duty to each other.

I am sure, my good sisters, there is no disagreement among us as to the importance of the home. Roosevelt has compared a home without children to "a land without trees—barren and unfruitful." While some children will go wrong in spite of the best training, and some will go right even where their surroundings are most unfortunate, nevertheless, an immense amount depends upon the family training, and just through this family training comes the companionship of which we are speaking.

WHAT DO THEY MEAN TO US? If I were to put the question here today, there is not a shadow of doubt what the answer would be—"What do our children mean to us?" Our children—"The loveliest flowers from God's own garden," as one old writer expressed it. The attitude of our Heavenly Father toward this great privilege of parenthood is shown in the story of Abraham, upon whose head was pronounced the blessing of all worldly wealth and honor, but the triumph of triumphs, the crowning blessing, was the promise of a posterity numerous as the sands upon the seashore.

From the inspiration of the gospel we draw the impelling motives for our aims in life, and we get a proper sense of values if we live up to its teachings. This has taught us the real significance of the question: "For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?" (Mark 8:36.) What doth it profit us, though we gain the whole world, and lose the souls of our children? So you mothers see that this privilege of parenthood, this blessing of children, carries with it the gravest responsibility of life. Our duty is hard, our tasks are great, but greatest of all is our reward.

Into the woman's keeping is committed the destiny of the generations to come after us. Surely she who can train her sons and daughters is thrice fortunate among them, and if she has succeeded so far, she has accomplished it through the establishment of a companionship with her children. It can never be done through any other medium.

WHAT OF THE WORLD? Since the world began there have been only two classes of people, one who declares that our times are the worst the world has seen, and another one which claims our times are the best. I believe we as a people belong to the latter class, with some reservations. Surely we appreciate our blessings, but we are not blind enough not to see that there are many great and real dangers to be reckoned with, and those which concern us more than all others combined have to do with our children.

The only real protection or adequate defense can be afforded by the home and its influences. But there is no denying the fact that some of our young people, especially girls, have gone in for crime professionally, on a scale extensive enough to be alarming. There is at least one sure cure: training the girls in the home.

Girls are not trained in the home today as they used to be. A girl should be taught some useful household tasks, or, at the very least, given by teaching and good example, a good standard of morals. Many girls of January 1969 today have no moral sense whatsoever. It is an age of conservatism versus jazz, and there is no understanding nor sympathy between parents and children, too many times.

Mothers give too little—girls take too much. They begin picking at each other instead of quietly and thoroughly threshing it out and coming to an understanding. If you parents have not that patience, forbearance, to understand these "jazzage children," they will cut loose and go where they are understood, and therein lies the tragedy of the situation.

It is only when parents and children come to a fellowship built upon understanding that they can be one in feeling and in heart. The fact that young people are ungrateful is a very common lament among us today. Well, they are—it is true. Some children are just naturally grateful and appreciative, others just the contrary. But this development of the trait of ingratitude indicates a woeful lack of education along the lines of appreciation, either of the material gifts, service rendered, or of the things worthwhile in the world.

Certainly this fault, if any in all the category, can be charged to parents' neglect.

RESPECT THE LAWS OF GOD Perhaps the fault of our children today is the lack of reverence, the disregard for any authority, temporal or spiritual. But, is the sin confined to the young alone? Is it not an irreverent age? Here again must we resort to the home as the one sure cure, and see to it that it is a sanctuary where the laws of God are respected and observed.

I have deliberately stressed the home as the greatest, most unfailing source of all good things in the world, but it is the workshop where human characters are built and the manner in which they are formed depends upon the relationship existing between parents and the children. The home cannot be what it should be unless these relations are of the proper character.

Whether they are so or not depends, it is true, upon both parents and children, but much more upon parents. They must do their best. Most effective training is done before the child is old enough to appreciate what is being done.

Teach the little ones to do the right thing. The great Master Teacher said, "Man cannot live by bread alone," neither can children live by merely having their material wants cared for. This is very necessary, it is true, but it is only a part; so far as the mother is concerned, much the easiest part of the work. First of all parents must try to be, or at least put forth their best efforts to be, what they wish the children to be. It is impossible for you to be an example of what you are not. The only way to teach children the beauty and use in service is to teach them how, and permit them to render it. "Oh, go away and leave me alone, I haven't time to be bothered," said a hurried, impatient mother to her little three-year-old daughter who was trying to help perform a certain household task.

I shall have to tell you what a youngster said to his mother when Sister Smith and I attended a stake conference in New York. Sister Smith asked all present to tell their mothers and fathers that they loved them, and for the parents not to push them away, when they came to tell them. This little child went to his mother and said, "Mama, I love you, and don't you push me away, like the good lady said."

With whom rests the fault? The desire to help is born with every normal child and parents have no right to complain. There can be no such thing as household drudgery when all assist with the tasks, and through the association in the discharge of these duties comes the sweetest companionship that can be experienced.

DEVELOP SYMPATHETIC UNDERSTANDING

If I had to suggest one thing which I think we as parents are most lacking, it would be a sympathetic understanding of our children. Live with the children; follow their paths, try with them to read "books in the running brooks/Sermons in stones and good in every thing." Teach them that the flower of youth never looks so lovely as when it bends to the sun of righteousness.

Know everything that claims the interest of the children, be a good sport with them, remembering always in the beautiful words of Wordsworth, "A child, more than all other gifts that earth can offer to declining man, brings hope with it and forward looking thoughts." As I look back on the history of our people, I see a past that is full of glory; looking ahead, I see a future full of promise. We have faith that we shall not prove false to the memories of the men and women of the mighty past. They did their work and left us the splendid heritage which we now enjoy.

Our highest aim is through the medium of loving companionship, to train our children to appreciate their inheritance. We may thus, in our turn, have the assured confidence that we shall be able to leave this heritage unwasted and enlarged to our children's children.

I am sure if we teach these things to the sisters of the Relief Society we shall see the fruits of companionship of parents and children, and what a great joy we will have in teaching these things that the Lord feels so important because he has stated, that we as parents will be held responsible if we fail in our teaching the gospel truths to our children.

President McKay said: I know of no better way to bring about harmony in the home, in the neighborhood, in organizations, peace in our country, and in the world than for every man and woman first to eliminate from his or her heart the enemies of harmony and peace such as hatred, selfishness, greed, animosity, and envy.

Now may the Lord bless you good sisters as you go into your different stakes and wards, and may His Spirit be with you and guide, guard, and protect you in the service of our Master, and I leave my blessing with you. And I am sure that President McKay would like me to express his love for you also, and I ask these blessings in the name of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. Amen.

As you may have observed, I think I have almost rewritten what I had planned to say to you. After the skit which has just been presented, and the singing of this beautiful chorus, the Lord willing and with your faith and prayers, and humbled by Sister Spafford's most unusual and, I'm afraid, all too undeserving introduction, I should attempt to talk somewhat to a subject which the Relief Society Presidency have suggested. This was the letter of the Relief Society Presidency from which I read.

"We feel the need for an authoritative statement on the obligations of membership in Relief Society as stated in a message of the First Presidency in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the Relief Society as published in A Centenary of Relief Society." 

This was the statement: "This divinely inspired origin brings with it a corresponding responsibility, in consecration to service, and in the loftiest loyalty to the Priesthood of God and to one another. The members should permit neither hostile nor competitive interests of any kind to detract from the duties and obligations, the privileges and honors, the opportunities and achievements of membership in this great Society." (A Centenary of Relief Society, page 7.)

That, I am sure, you will recognize as a tremendous challenge to one assigned to address this great conference. As I studied that statement of the First Presidency, there came back to me a statement that must have come from a great teacher who knew the importance of repetition as the soul of learning. This was cast in great long words, but every one of them is meaningful, and this I shall give to you.

"Frequent recurrence to fundamentals is essential to perpetuity." Now, if you think about that, "frequent recurrence to fundamentals is essential to perpetuity." As I analyzed the statement of the First Presidency, I became aware that there were four headings. And it is to those four headings that I shall now attempt to make a few comments.

First: The responsibility of Relief Society in consecration to service. Consecration means to set apart or devote to the service or worship of God. Service means a performance of labor for the benefit of another; spiritual serving, as shown by obedience, good works, and love, as dedicated to the service of God.

As I listened to this skit on obedience, impressing obedience to what the Brethren have commanded, or have instructed, or have pleaded with us regarding family home evening, I am tempted to repeat some of what I said to you a year ago, at least to recall to you a few things, as I link it with this specific part of the Presidency's message.

MOTHER'S ROLE IS TO TEACH GOSPEL

What is the mother's role? Obligations of Membership in Relief Society then, in the great service of the kingdom? Her first and most important role is to remember the teaching of the gospel in the family as it was expressed in the first revelation, given in the First Section of the Doctrine and Covenants, which has been called the Preface to the revelations to this day. And four important purposes of gospel restoration as they apply particularly to the home were expressed.

And then I read from the First Section of the Doctrine and Covenants:

a. "That faith also might increase in the earth; and inasmuch as they erred, that it might be made known;
b. "and inasmuch as they sought wisdom, that they might be instructed;
c. "and inasmuch as they sinned, they might be chastened, that they might repent;
d. "and inasmuch as they were humble, they might be made strong, and blessed from on high, and receive knowledge from time to time."

(Doctrine and Covenants 1:21, 25-28.)

Now the mother's role in this vital home-centered gospel teaching is very clear. And I just speak now of some of those things to recall what you just heard and witnessed in this excellent presentation that has been called to our attention.

Put Father at the head of the house. And as they said, even when he doesn't seem to deserve it. Provoking husbands to honor their priesthood when they are not honoring their priesthood; enlisting the aid of the priesthood in helping you with family problems—home teachers, holding of your family home evenings, and even if Father isn't there, or even if some of the children are 9 January 1969 not always there, but make an effort to see to it ahead of time that everyone is alerted to the fact that this night is family home night, and there must be nothing to interfere.

Mothers stay at the crossroads of the home. Some time ago, I was attending a quarterly stake conference in a stake that I will not identify, and the names I will use will not be the real names, lest you try to identify it.

THE IMPORTANCE OF TEMPLE MARRIAGE

I had looked over the statistics and had discovered a very poor percentage of those who were married had been married in the temple. And as I looked over the afternoon conference session, I said to the president of the stake, thinking of something that might be done and said to awaken them to the need for some more impressive attendance of this vital matter, "Have you some mother here, an older mother, who had a large family and had the joy of seeing every one of her family married in the temple?"

He looked out over the audience and he said, "Well, there is Sister (I shall call her Sister Jones), she has had a family of eleven, and they all have been married in the temple, but you don't expect to call her up to speak? She has never been called on to speak to an audience of this kind."

I said, "I suppose not, if she's raised a family of eleven. I didn't say I was going to call on her to speak, I want her to come up here, I want to ask her a few questions."

And as this lovely white-haired mother stood beside me at the microphone, I said, "Would you take a lesson out of your book and tell us, what have you done to reach this most marvelous achievement?"

And she replied, "Well, I never thought of it." But I urged her for a further expression. "I might give you two suggestions. In the first place, when our family was growing up, I always was there at the crossroads of the home, when my children were coming to or going from the home. And second: whatever we did we did together as a family. We played together, we prayed together, we worked together, we did everything together. I guess that's all I can think of."

I said to her, "Now you have preached two great sermons." Then I looked down at the audience and there was a young mother holding in her arms what I supposed was her first baby, and I asked the stake president, "Was that young lady married in the temple?" And he replied, "Yes," so I invited her to come to the stand and asked her if she would say something about how important she considered her temple marriage.

PART OF AN ETERNAL FAMILY CIRCLE

When she got her breath, she said, "Well, I am the eleventh child of that mother who has just spoken. And when you asked her those questions, I said, why doesn't he ask us that question? We know what mother did, that made us wish to do what she wanted us to do in the home."

Then she told of some of the experiences she had had as she grew up. She obtained employment by a man who was a "wolf," who tried to take advantage of the young girls who worked in that place of employment. She resisted, but he made fun of her parents. What he said was contrary to the standards of her home, to the teachings of her parents.

He said, "Why don't you grow up? Why don't you have some fun? Why do you have to stay tied to these old folks of yours?"

And so she thought maybe she was a little too restrained. So the next Sunday morning she said, "Mother, I am not going to Sunday School."

Mother looked a little startled, and she said, "All right, my dear, you are old enough to know your own mind." And then she added, "I sat at the window and watched the two white-topped 'buggies' drawn out of the farm yard on the way to church. It was so far that after Sunday School, with an hour recess, they went back in for sacrament meeting, so it meant that I was home all day long, all alone. It was the loneliest day that I had ever spent. And I resolved that day that never again as long as life lasted, would I ever do anything consciously that would deprive me of the right to belong to my wonderful family."

I say to you mothers today that the greatest deterrent to keep your children from going contrary to your counsel will be the fear of losing their place in the eternal family circle. But they will not lose their place in the kingdom if you have built a wonderful home life and have been holding your Family Home Evenings.

LOYALTY TO THE PRIESTHOOD The second point that the Presidency makes essential is loyalty to the Priesthood of God. I have been reading some interesting history from secular sources—Dr. Mosheim's Ecclesiastical History, and there it has been interesting for me to see how many facets of today's organization are clearly set forth where apostolic authority is defined, where organizations that would be comparable to our stakes were presided over by leaders like ours; where the tithing system was clearly outlined; the manner of address, "brother" and "sister;" where priesthood watchmen were clearly defined; stakes, which they called dioceses; all churches are subject to apostles. The holy scriptures were guides to Christianity. And apostates began to usurp authority and to call themselves by church titles, and the progress of the church to be attributed to human means not to divine power. As I thought of this assignment, I looked to see if I could find something that would parallel the Relief Society. The Lord had said through the apostle Paul: And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues. (I Corinthians 12:28.) Dummelow's Bible Commentary explains that helps, as used in the scriptures, could be interpreted as "including the original work of deacons, ministrations to the poor and sick." (Page 913.) And from Mosheim's Ecclesiastical History: The people by offering large and generous contributions when the safety and interests of the community rendered them necessary... Each one bore a part proportioned to his circumstances. These were brought before the assemblies and were called "oblations." There reigned among the members of the Christian church a perfect equality. This appeared by the feasts of charity in which all were indiscriminately assembled; by the names of brethren and sisters. (Mosheim's Ecclesiastical History, page 104.) Then he goes on: Some, particularly of the eastern churches, elected deaconesses and chose for that purpose, matrons or widows of eminent sanctity who administered to the necessities of the poor, and performed several other offices, that tended to the maintenance of order and decency in the church. Did you ever hear of the Relief Society so well described? BISHOP'S WORK WITH RELIEF SOCIETY And again he describes the work of the bishops as it relates to this organization. Let none, however, confound the bishops of this primitive and golden period of the church with those we read of in the following pages. For though they were both distinguished by the same name, yet they differed extremely, and that in many respects. A bishop during the first and second century, was a person who had the care of one Christian assembly, which at that time was, generally speaking, small enough to be contained in a private house. In this assembly he acted not so much with the authority of a master, as with the zeal and diligence of a faithful servant. He instructed the people, performed the several parts of divine worship. Attended the sick, and inspected into the circumstances and supplies of the poor. He charged, indeed, the presbyters (elders) with the performance of those duties and services, which the multiplicity of his engagements rendered it impossible for him to fill; but had not the power to decide or enact anything without the consent of the presbyters (elders) and the people. The revenues were extremely small, since the church had no certain income, but depended upon gifts or oblations of the multitude, which, no doubt, were inconsiderable. (Ibid. Pp. 105-106.) There you have it. The Relief Society helps in the government of the Church. The Relief Society, as no other organization, is the "handmaiden" of the Priesthood of God. In their joint responsibility in rendering compassionate service, they present a sort of "Father and Mother Image" in the Kingdom of God to look after the needy and the unfortunate. LOYALTY TO EACH OTHER Now this next, Mothers, the Presidency calls your attention to loyalty to each other. Visiting teachers have their place in the teaching of mothers who have not developed the knowledge and methods in keeping pace with their children. And, as I wrote that statement here, I remembered what somebody said, "If you want to keep young, go where youth are, and if you want to get old, try to keep up with them." But there was something that was said to me by a banker friend, a short while ago, who was visiting our city. He took me aside and said, "I have a daughter who is having disciplinary problems with her family. I have just said to her, 'I want you to go out and live among the Mormon people where they can teach you how to discipline your children.' My daughter looked at me and said, 'You mean you want me to join the Church?' I said, 'That's exactly what I mean.'" I asked him if he knew about our Family Home Evening program. He had never heard of it. I sent him two Family Home Evening Manuals, one for last year, and one for this year, and suggested that he give these as a help to his daughter in counseling with her daughter. After he does that, I propose to ask him if he and his wife are holding Family Home Evenings, likewise. SEX EDUCATION IN THE SCHOOLS There is something else that is giving many of our mothers great concern today. That is the matter of sex education in the schools. I had some worried mothers, with their stake presidency, who came up to a stake conference I was attending in the California area a short while ago. And they were worried because of the ugly things that are creeping into the sex education, that to them go beyond the bounds of propriety which in their opinion is giving dangerous instruction to children and youth. Now what has that to do with Relief Society? I had a visit from a woman who was writing a book. She wanted to know if I would read her manuscript, and I took a look at it. It was on sex. And I said I had no time to read this book, and she said, "Will you read this one chapter?" And it was one of the raciest, most blunt, and most plain descriptions that I could possibly read. As I laid it down, she asked, "Well, what do you think of it?" "Well," I said, "if I spoke frankly I would tell you that you could never print that kind of a book with my consent." She looked a bit startled. She was not pleased. But a short while afterwards, one of our sisters took me aside and questioned me because I had said this to her friend. And I said, "Well, I have something that I heard President Clark say, and I should like to read it to you." And that came to my mind today after I had heard these sisters from California, and I want to read what President Clark said a few years ago. Unchastity is too common.

It is in our schools from the grades up. It is in our business houses and industrial plants. It is too large a part of our ordinary and social lives. Parents are grasping at straws in an effort to hold their children. A cry is raised, the Church needs a book on sex, but what should such a book tell? All that the schools have taught about sex facts on all their teachings have torn away the modesty that once clothed sex. Their discussions tend to make it sometimes seem as if they make sex animals out of boys and girls. The teachings do little but arouse curiosity for experience. It is said these courses tell enough about the generation of human beings to enable them to largely escape parenthood. Books are written, courses are given about courtship and marriage, to what point? We have not too far to go to get the heathenish abominations practiced and preached in an early time again, against which the Lord has again and again lashed out at ancient Israel and early Christians. 13 January 1969

A work on chastity can begin in one sentence: Be chaste. That tells everything. You do not need to know all the details of reproduction processes in order to keep clean. Be chaste because God commanded it. That is all there is to it. Thou shalt not commit adultery, said the Lord at Sinai, and he has drawn no fine distinctions such as some would like to draw between adultery and fornication. The Lord used the words interchangeably.

KEEP FAITH IN GOD STRONG

I read something another writer had said on this same subject. He said the reason for sex deviation is loss of belief in God. Once they lose God, they lose the purpose of life, and when the purpose of living is forgotten, the universe becomes meaningless. This impresses the importance, then, of visiting teaching by Relief Society sisters. When you go into a home, and you find the mother and father who haven't the genius or the talent to teach their children, it is your business to help these mothers in this most vital part of their family education. Go with motherly intuition, sensing in the heart what the mind does not know.

Your place in the Welfare Program will be told and more completely by Elder Taylor, so I will just mention one or two thoughts. Teaching for successful wifehood and motherhood is a part of welfare; to demonstrate a woman's effectiveness as a homemaker; preparing a mother to receive her new baby; analyze accurately through a loyal sister's eyes the wants and needs which brethren may not perceive.

Don't gossip about matters relating to your sisters. Never remember nor publicize what you do for another, but never forget a favor a sister renders to you. Yes, be loyal to each other, as sisters in the gospel of the kingdom.

We can banish competitive or hostile interests that detract from Relief Society duties, obligations, privileges, and honor, opportunities and achievement of membership.

While attending a meeting of an organization of women, I shall not name it, I was startled when one of our Relief Society presidents was introduced as the speaker for that occasion. In the introduction this organization head said, "She has now graduated from Relief Society into this woman's organization."

Graduating from Relief Society!

RELIEF SOCIETY FULFILLS NEEDS

There must be a constant reassessing of what Relief Society gives to make certain nothing is left out in filling the needs of younger mothers and older grandmothers to fulfill the purpose of the Relief Society as defined by the Prophet Joseph Smith. And keep in mind what I said as I started, "frequent recurrence to fundamentals is essential to perpetuity." Read again and again from those early instructions and bring the Relief Society back to those standards as may be needed.

Relief Society must not be something simply to duplicate worldly organizations, such as social clubs, or PTA, or literary societies. But Relief Society must make a significant contribution not to be obtained anywhere else.

In matters of home storage, again Brother Taylor will tell you more about that, and may I just offer this one caution. Don't promote competitive purchasing or merchandise projects of a commercial nature under the name of the Relief Society or any other Church entity.

Give counsel to mothers who are neglecting their families in some of the important details. Now when I speak of these mothers, of what these schools are doing in the way of teaching children about intimate things of life—mothers in the outside world are worried. I just read in the Sunday newspaper that in 1970, there will be one out of ten births that will be illegitimate births. Shocking!

Forty per cent of our unwed mothers under twenty years of age are from families on relief; fifty per cent already had one or more illegitimate children. And to combat the rising tide of illegitimacy, they write, public and private agencies are focusing their attention on education.

Among the measures aimed at prevention of illegitimacy are sex education courses in public schools, special schools for unwed mothers, birth control, assistance to repeaters on welfare. But not one word about the thing that the Lord has said, "Thou shalt not."

And the positive things that President Clark has told us. Be chaste because God commands!

"BRAVERY IS COURAGE IN ACTION."

I read something from General Omar Bradley's definition of obligations of membership in Relief Society bravery. (He was a famous general under General Dwight D. Eisenhower in the Second World War.)

"Bravery," he said, "is courage in action. It is that quality which enables a man to face up to a challenge with decision and purpose whether that challenge be eminent physical danger, or the defense of a moral principle, or a pioneering effort in new fields of progress. It is that which sets the hero above the coward."

We have a challenge today in these things of which I have spoken. We have a challenge before us in this State of Utah with regard to the threat of legislation which would increase the availability of alcoholic beverages which, may the Lord forbid, come in the way that is now being proposed in the coming election.

You mothers must rise up whenever you see the ugly heads of these things and make sure that these things shall not be brought to your very doors. Bravery is courage in action. It produces the deed which sets the hero above the coward, as I have quoted.

Yes, remember what the First Presidency has said in their Centennial message to the Relief Society and their injunctions which I have repeated to you now with such observations as I have been able to bring from my understanding and study of what they said. May the Lord bless us so to do, and give us the courage of our convictions in these troublous days and challenging times in which we live.

I humbly pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

Heywood, Regional Representative of the Council of the Twelve.
We Mayola Rogers Miltenberger possesses a heritage which she has tremendously built upon. Heritage, training, experience, and accomplishment fit her well to serve unselfishly in the call, as of October 23, 1968, to the Relief Society General Board. She is the daughter of Marion and Leanora Smith Rogers. Sister Miltenberger's forebears have given faithful service in the Church. Her mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother served as Relief Society stake presidents. Her great-grandfather was the first stake president of the Snowflake Stake. Her great-grandmother, Aurelia Spencer Rogers, daughter of Orson Spencer, founded the Primary Association. After high school graduation in Snowflake, Arizona, two years at the Brigham Young University, and a Bachelor's Degree at the University of Arizona, she obtained a Master's Degree in social work at Tulane University. She is a member of the Academy of Certified Social Workers, and a charter member of the National Association of Social Workers, and was Arizona Chapter chairman of the latter organization at one time. Sister Miltenberger has served in many Church positions, which include ward Relief Society president. In these callings, as well as in her professional field, she has put the Church and the Lord first, being ever careful not to lean on her own understanding. In 1962, she was chosen to establish and direct the newly organized Arizona Relief Society Service Social, under the leadership of the Relief Society General Presidency and the priesthood of the area. Her work has been of such quality that the Relief Society General Presidency has called upon her strength and organizing ability to establish agencies of the Church in two other states, as well as to help in the parent agency in Utah. Sister Miltenberger's late husband, Lt. Col. Edwin J. Miltenberger, was a military career man and came from one of the old established, respected families of New Orleans. A host of friends and loved ones will wish her continued blessings in her new calling.

Maurine M. Haycock Appointed to The General Board of Relief Society
Edith S. Elliott, Member, General Board of Relief Society

W Maurine McClellan Haycock was called to serve as a member of the General Board of Relief Society on October 23, 1968. She is well qualified for this position. The most important aim in her life is to serve the Lord. Her parents were George A. and Mary Wright McClellan. In 1938 she was married to David Arthur Haycock in the Salt Lake Temple. Early in their married life she held the unique position of being the wife of the youngest bishop in the Church at that time. Bishop Haycock was twenty-six years old when called to serve in Riverview Ward, Pioneer Stake. In 1952, the Haycock family moved to Washington, D.C. When Brother Haycock became administrative assistant to Elder Ezra Taft Benson, Secretary of Agriculture in President Eisenhower's cabinet. Sister Maurine served as a Relief Society visiting teacher. Two years later, Brother Haycock was appointed President of the Hawaiian Mission, and Sister Haycock gave devoted service to her new duties. When released, the family moved to Bountiful, Utah, and Brother Haycock is now secretary to the Council of the Twelve. Sister Haycock has had valuable experience in several wards as a class leader or as a member of the presidency in all of the Church auxiliaries. Sister Haycock's leadership was soon recognized and she was called to the Presidency of the South Davis Relief Society Stake Board. She has served for eight years as second counselor and then first counselor in charge of homemaking. For the past four years she has correlated the sewing assignments for the thirteen stakes in the Salt Lake Regional Bishops Storehouse. Brother and Sister Haycock are the parents of four lovely daughters: Marilyn (Mrs. Dee E. Morrison), Salinas, California; Judith Ann (Mrs. Carl W. Buchanan), Bountiful, Utah; Lynnette, a senior at Brigham Young University; and Cheryl, Senior at Viewmont High School, Bountiful. Little David Wendell Buchanan and Rebecca Ann Morrison will soon be saying, "Grandma" and "Grandpa." Truly the Haycock "cup runneth over."

D.2. D. D.2.2.2.2.2.2. 2.2 em em eN 0000009 OQ Prepared by the Genealogical Society, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints

Of vital interest to members of the Relief Society was an announcement made in the October 1968 priesthood meeting of the Semi-annual General Conference of the Church. It was disclosed in this meeting by a member of the First Presidency that the Genealogical Society has devised a more efficient system for preparing records to be used for temple ordinance work. During the seventy-five years of its organization, the Genealogical Society has tried to be of assistance to the saints in the work that Joseph Smith the Prophet described as "one of the greatest and most important subjects that God has revealed." During these years the Genealogical Society has continually searched to discover better and more efficient ways of performing the work of identifying our deceased relatives so the research and temple ordinance work could go forward more efficiently and rapidly. Acting under the direction and guidance of the First Presidency of the Church, and after prayerful and thoughtful deliberation, a simplified system of recording identifying information of our kindred dead has been developed. Under this new plan the work of submitting records for temple ordinance work can go forward with greater ease and accuracy, and with much speedier processing of the tabulated information.

In January 1969, a new instructional booklet will be made available to the members of the Church which will provide the details of this new program for simplifying and recording research work. Accompanying the booklet will be a sample form of a new, easy-to-use record called the Individual Entry Form. This form will allow individual names to be submitted to the Genealogical Society for temple ordinance work. Heretofore, only completed family group records have been accepted which has forced our saints not only to gather information for the family as a whole, thus slowing their efforts, but has also required them to make complex decisions beyond their capacity to do so. Under the new system the names of individuals will be submitted so that the temple work can be performed on an individual basis.

The new program will be called the GIANT System, which name is taken from the initial letters of the complete name, Genealogical Information And Name Tabulation System. The new manual explaining the procedures for submitting individual names for ordinance work will be very concise and will consist of only twenty-seven pages of instruction. The Prophet Joseph taught,...

That we redeem our dead, and connect ourselves with our fathers which are in heaven, and seal up our dead to come forth in the first resurrection; and here we want the power of Elijah to seal those who dwell on earth to those who dwell in heaven. (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, Joseph Fielding Smith, page 337-338.) The GIANT System is so simple that all members of the Church from twelve years of age and up can use this method to comply with and fulfill the Lord's direction to the Church. Following the publication and distribution of the new instructional brochure, there will be a six-month period in which to complete and submit to the Genealogical Society all family group records already in preparation under the present system. During this period the Society can acquaint themselves with the new system. After July 1, 1969, no more family group records prepared under the old system will be accepted by the Society. This will give the Society time to complete the processing of all records in its possession by The GIANT System in Genealogical Work—1969 October 1969. Beginning 1 October 1969, the Society will begin to accept the new individual entry. All records of research work should be submitted under the new plan on the new individual entry form and on family group record forms prepared under the new system. It is not to be inferred that the family group record will no longer be used or that it is being modified or changed. The Genealogical Society will still accept work submitted on these forms, but these will then be prepared in accordance with the simplified instructions which are part of the GIANT System. It will be more advantageous, in most instances, for the saints to use the individual entry forms for all future work when the information gathered will qualify the sheet for acceptance by the Society. The present program of ward record examiners will be continued without change. A modified instructional booklet for ward record examiners will be issued, but no change in procedures will be made. Relief Society sisters all over the Church will find this simplified program for submitting names for temple work to be easily understood and simple to fill out. The GIANT System will aid the saints better to carry out the divine edict of saving our dead and becoming saviors on Mount Zion. The Relief Society Presidency will present information in greater detail in future issues of the Relief Society Magazine so that our sisters will be well-informed and prepared to assist their husbands in priesthood genealogical work.

ADVICE TO THE VULNERABLE
Never say, "For the last time"
About a lovely thing.
Savor with joy the moment
And let the heart sing.
Too final a sound, "For the last time,"
Too poignant the sudden ache.
If ecstasy's gift be thus stolen
The heart may silently break.
Drink to the full each rapture
Take life through the open gate.
And if it should be "For the last time"
Oh, let that knowledge wait.

21 January 1969

As one studies the scriptures, one wonders at the power of fasting and prayer. President Joseph F. Smith said that, if observed by the world,... Fasting would call attention to the sin of overeating, place the body in subjection to the spirit, and so promote communion with the Holy Ghost, and insure a spiritual strength and power. As fasting should always be accompanied by prayer, this law would bring people nearer to God.

We read that Daniel was given power and understanding after mourning three full weeks, I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled. Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words.

Inspiring words on fasting and its power are learned from the experiences of the sons of Mosiah: they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation and when they taught, they taught with power and authority of God. (Alma 17:3.)

Experiencing joy seems to be a part of true fasting, also, for one reads in the Doctrine and Covenants:...

That thy fasting may be perfect, or in other words, that thy joy may be full. Verily, this is fasting and prayer, or rejoicing and prayer. While the observance of Fast Day is outlined in some detail, the principle of fasting would seem to be an observance in the gospel which is left to the individual to live. How often should one pray on a Fast Day is left to the individual to decide. How often should one fast at other times than Fast Day is also a matter of individual decision. In times of grave illness and heavy trouble, however, instinctively one seeks the Lord in fasting and prayer, for the scriptures teach the power to be found therein. The Lord has said that he will not command in all things. President Joseph F. Smith said 'God delights in the willing heart.' (J. D. 25:59.) When one fasts it should be accompanied by joy. The Savior said:... When ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance... That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret. (Matt. 6:16, 18.) President Joseph F. Smith added the comment, ''In other words, appear to the world to be happy.'' (J. D. 25:58.) Emphasizing the personal discretion in fasting, President Smith also said: but let it be remembered that the observance of the fast day by abstaining twenty-four hours from food and drink is not an absolute rule, it is no iron-clad law to us, but it is left with the people as a matter of conscience, to exercise wisdom and discretion.... But those should fast who can... (Gospel Doctrine, Third Ed., page 306.) He also said: On the Sabbath day you are to do no other thing than to prepare your food with singleness of heart, that your fasting may be perfect, and your joy may be full. This is what the Lord calls fasting and prayer. (Ibid. P. 308.) The Prophet Joseph wrote, under date of January 17, 1843, This being the time appointed by the Twelve as a day of humiliation, fasting, praise, prayer, and thanksgiving before the great Eloheim.... There was great joy among the people, that I had once more been delivered from the grasp of my enemies. (DHC V:252.) Fasting expresses to the Lord deep and profound personal feelings, prayers of entreaty, prayers of gratitude, of thanksgiving, prayers for assistance in preparation for a special calling, prayers of love, of affirmation of faith reaching to knowledge. The joys of fasting and prayer are to be found. There is a great power to be experienced in fasting and prayer offered by the Lord to all as a blessing and a joy in spiritual strength and inner light. —M. C. S.

23 FALL AND SPRING SOCIALS

Since Relief Society work is carried forward on a twelve-month basis, it is recommended that the two socials, heretofore designated as opening and closing socials, be called hereafter fall and spring socials, respectively.

SETTING APART TO POSITIONS IN STAKE AND WARD AUXILIARIES

The General Board of Relief Society calls attention to the recent ruling appearing in The Priesthood Bulletin, November 1968, page 14 "Setting Apart to Positions in Stake and Ward Auxiliaries," paragraphs 4 and 5, that the sustaining vote of the ward membership of ward officers and teachers in ward auxiliary organizations is to be held at a sacrament meeting under the direction of the bishop. (This clarifies and amends instructions given in the "Official Instructions," The Relief Society Magazine, November 1968, page 826.)

MAGAZINES TO BE ORDERED ONE MONTH BEFORE BEGINNING DATE

The General Board calls to the attention of magazine subscribers the need to order the magazine a full month ahead of the month in which it is to be started. For instance, a subscription to begin in March should reach the magazine office by the first of February. When the desired issue is not received by a subscriber, invariably it is found that the order for the magazine did not reach the General Board office by the first of the preceding month.

THANKS FOR FRIENDS

Thanks for the friends who remember to pray for me,
Who when I am weak know just what to say for me,
Whose faith remains strong when mine seems diminished,
Who feel that my work is important, not finished,

Thanks for the friends who through years stand undaunted,
Who make me feel needed, beloved, and wanted. —Roxana Farnsworth Hase

24 FIGHT BIRTH DEFECTS
GIVE March of Dimes The National Foundation George P. Voss Vice-President for Public Relations

When the March of Dimes entered the field in 1958, birth defects seemed to be an unconquerable health menace, and, even today, 250,000 of America's newborn are stricken annually, and an additional 500,000 babies die in the womb. Medical science is beginning to see some hope, however, for the prevention of some defects. The recently marketed Rh vaccine and the German measles vaccine now being developed are two examples. In addition, the March of Dimes conducts prenatal care education programs to help reduce defects and infant mortality.

The March of Dimes depends on an informed public to finance its programs of basic and clinical research, its nationwide network of more than 100 Birth Defects Centers and its programs of professional and public education. When you give to the March of Dimes, you fight birth defects. You help support more than 100 birth defects treatment centers. You help support brilliant medical scientific investigators. You help support a massive health education program aimed at getting the best possible medical care for every mother-to-be. That's the way it should be. Every child is entitled to a healthy start in life.

Most children born with birth defects can be helped, but too many people still believe these afflictions are hopeless. Help us tell them of the progress medical science has made.

But I, within these walls touched by fireglow,
Escape his grasp, through magic of beloved books.
So, winterbound, completely free am I this winter hour. —Dorothy R.

Fa @ Mary placed the last decoration on the Christmas tree before moving to the window to watch the soft white snow drift silently to the ground. It's going to be a wonderful Christmas this year, she thought—the children will have such a delightful time in the snow. If this weather continues, I'll have to dig Roy's old bobsled out of the garage. She sat down. She was still feeling a little weak from her illness and three-weeks stay at the nursing home. She had so much to be thankful for; she was well enough to have her son and his family home for Christmas, and the stay at the nursing home hadn't been so bad really— for one thing she had met some new friends. She leaned back on the davenport thoughtfully. She had meant to visit back at the Home before 26 "I can't imagine... Why you would ask me." "It You Give Enough" Helen H. Trutton this. Most of the patients she had met were lonely, some were neglected by their families, and some had no one at all to care for. Maybe she could manage a short visit tomorrow and take them Some of the cookies she had just baked. She chuckled to herself. Not even three hungry grandchildren could eat the dozens and dozens she had made. Mary sat up straight. She would prepare a lovely basket of her choicest cookies and give them to Mrs. Gibson. Maybe she wouldn't accept them. Mary had tried to make friends with her, but she certainly hadn't succeeded during the three weeks. Mrs. Gibson was the loneliest person in the entire nursing home, that was certain. Mary didn't see one visitor enter her room. Once she asked the nurse about her. She had answered, "Seriously, have you any daily visitors?" "No," or she thers," Y clasped her head, allowing her hair to fall down over her hands. Winging a lock of greeted her, has the flU—th Possibly "If You Give Enough" children would not be here for Christmas, why not Invite some of her friends from the nursing home to spend the day with her? red ribbons, and was hurrying down the street. Supposing Mrs. Gibson wouldn't accept her invitation to spend Christmas with her? Certainly it was her privilege to refuse. She recalled the mornings when she was at the nursing home. She would smile and say "good morning." Sometimes Mrs. Gibson barely answered and sometimes she appeared not to hear. Several times Mary had stopped at her door and attempted a conversation, but she never got far. She slowed her steps, she was nearing the nursing home now. The snow was still coming down in large white graceful flakes like a bird winging its way to the earth. Everything looked so peaceful and calm, even the late blooming flowers didn't seem to mind the intrusion of the blanket of snow as they nodded daintily in the light breeze. She shook the snow from her scarf she had tied around her head, and stepped inside the building. Mrs. Lawes, the head nurse and manager, met her at the door. "My goodness, Mary Nish, what are you doing out on such a day?" 28 "It's really very pleasant out there, and I am bundled up like an Eskimo." "You must be careful." "I am. I made a few cookies for some of my friends." Mrs. Lawes smiled broadly. "Well, I can wager they will be happy to see you." Mary started down the hall. "T'll want to have a few words with you when I get ready to leave." "Very well, Mrs. Nish, I won't be far away." Mary hummed a tune as she hurried down the hall to make her first stop in the room of Mrs. Larson. She was delighted as she peeked her head around the open door to see three other friends she had planned to invite. "Well, Mary Nish," Mrs. Larson said, "come in, it's good to see you." "You look like Santa Claus," another greeted her. "I'm glad I found you four together," she said, handing each a package of cookies. "I hope you'll like them. I baked them fresh today." '"Home-baked cookies!" they all seemed to exclaim in unison. "How wonderful, Mary," Mrs. Larson added, "but should you do so much?" "T feel fine. Oh, I take it easy and slow, of course." "Sit down. We were just talking about you," Mrs. Larson said. "We miss your smiling face. You kept us all happy," Mrs. Smith said, then quickly added, "but, of course, we're glad you are well and can be home, especially for Christmas." Mary removed her coat before sitting down. "My children, that is, my son and his family will be detained in coming home for Christmas—my grandson has the flu, but we'll be together later." "That's good," Mrs. Larson said. "So I was thinking, why not have you four over for the day? I want to ask Mrs. Johnson, too, and Mrs. Gibson." "We'd love to come," they replied again all together. "Mrs. Johnson has gone to her daughter's home,' Mrs. Smith said, "but Mrs. Gibson?" "Mary, I don't suppose she would come—she's still no friendlier than she was when you were here," Mrs. Larson said. "But I could ask." "Yes, you could." She stood up. "Then it's all settled." "If we can get permission to spend a day away from the nursing home," Mrs. Larson said. "T'll check with Mrs. Lawes right after I see Mrs. Gibson, and I'll let you know." At her next stop, she hesitated several moments before tapping on the door. She waited a short time, then knocked again. "Come in," she heard Mrs. Gibson say, "since when does a nurse knock before entering." Mary stuck her head in the door and called, "It's Mary Nish." "IT see," Mrs. Gibson answered, "IT thought you had gone home some time ago." "T brought you some cookies, I hope you'll enjoy them." The woman sitting in her wheelchair stared at her without speaking— immediately. Finally she stammered, "Why—I—why would you bring me anything?" "If You Give Enough" "Because I thought you might enjoy them. They're fresh and my favorite recipe." Mrs. Gibson turned away quickly. "I didn't mean to sound rude, I—I just didn't expect anyone to bring me anything. They look delicious, thank you. Thank you very much. Would you care to sit down?" Mary smiled across the room at her. "Yes, for a moment. You see I'm inviting four of my friends from the nursing home to spend Christmas day at my home, and I—I hoped you'd come, too. Would you Mrs. Gibson?" 'The woman looked at her first with wonderment, and yet there was gratitude, too, in her eyes. She fumbled with a handkerchief and wiped her face. "I can't imagine," she finally said slowly, "why you would ask me. I've stayed behind these four walls for over a year—I didn't think anyone cared." "Most people around you are friendly, if you give them a chance to be." Mrs. Gibson left her wheelchair and moved over to the window. "I guess I never did have much of a way with people."

I have one visitor, and she seldom comes. I don't blame her—not really." "Will you come?" Mary asked again. "You—you mean you really want me? What about your other guests?" "We all want you." She went back to the wheelchair and sat down quietly. "Thank you, Mrs. Nish, yes, I'd like so much to come to your 29 January 1969 home for Christmas—if I'm allowed to leave." Mary stood up. "I'll get permission from Mrs. Lawes right now." She found her in the office near the entrance still checking charts. She looked up and smiled. "Looks as if you found them all. You want to see me?" Mary handed her the list. "I'd like very much to have these ladies spend Christmas day at my home." The nurse took the slip of paper and studied it closely for several moments. Finally, she said, "I'm sorry, Mrs. Nish, but you have several on this list who need frequent medication; we couldn't possibly let them leave. Mrs. Gibson, for instance..." "Not even for a few hours?" "It wouldn't be advisable—I'm certain their doctors wouldn't allow it." She looked again at the sheet of paper she was holding. "Let's see, Mrs. Larson could go, and possibly, Mrs. Smith—but." "I was going to cook a Christmas dinner." Doctor Lamson stuck his head around the door at that moment. "You were going to do what, Mary Nish?" "Oh, hello, Doctor, I didn't see you." He laughed. "That's obvious. I'm sorry, but as your doctor, I say absolutely not. You'd fuss too much." "But I've already asked them." "I'm sorry," Mrs. Lawes said. Mary looked from the doctor to the nurse—there was no use arguing with them, but what had she done? Built up everyone's hopes? Now she would have to 30 tell them they couldn't come. She turned sadly to return to her friends, and almost bumped into Mrs. Gibson. "You heard?" she asked. "You tried," she said softly. Then she turned to Mrs. Lawes. "I have the largest room in this place. Could we have a table in my room and?" "And have the dinner there?" the nurse asked. "Yes, and invite everyone on this list. Mrs. Nish could be our guest." "Why, yes, of course you could. How about it, Mary?" Doctor Lamson put his hand on Mary's shoulder. "Now, I'd agree to that." Her face broke into a broad smile. She glanced up at the physician, her chin tilted with just a hint of that determined air that even he had learned long ago not to argue with. "Could I make a couple of pies and a few other goodies, Doctor?" He laughed. "If you promise to save me a piece of pie." "I promise." "Then it's settled," Mrs. Gibson said, and for the first time Mary saw that she was smiling. "Will you tell the others?" "I surely will," Mary answered. "Thank you." After Mrs. Gibson left, Mrs. Lawes reached out and took Mary's hand. "How did you ever do it? I didn't think anyone could ever reach Mrs. Gibson." Then she squeezed her hand. "Oh, I know all right. I've heard you say if 'if you give enough love...' well, you did win, Mrs. Nish. Have a wonderful Christmas!" Melda Barker Steele Skinner, Provo, Utah, has often been called the "Quilt Lady." She estimates that she has made over 300 quilts for gifts and for donation to Relief Society. In addition to making quilts, she also sews rags for rugs, and embroiders towels and pillow cases. Her homemade bread is one of the first items sold at Relief Society fund-raising events. Sister Skinner is the mother of six children; she has twenty-four grandchildren, and twenty great-grandchildren, all of whom adore her. For the young ones, she makes doll quilts, which are treasured throughout the years. Annie Jensen Kirby McQueen, Preston, Idaho, not only makes beautiful quilts, but she teaches this art to others. She has originated many beautiful patterns. For fifty-five years she has been a member of Relief Society, and for many of these years she has served as "quilt chairman." For each new baby in the family, she has made a lovely quilt, and has donated many to Relief Society bazaars. At one Relief Society General Conference, she provided a display at the homemaking session, which was lovely and well received. Eight natural children call her mother, as well as four others whom she reared, and many grandchildren love their busy grandma. 7. Aa © ~Make Room w A daystretcher, Laura Redding thought. Why couldn't some inventive genius come up with that? A guaranteed success—women would stand in line for even the first, unperfected models. Or, at the very least, a wasted-time collection device that would pick up all the time from all the people who might say, "I simply don't know what to do with myself today," place it on tap at some central bureau, to be dispensed like plasma or gamma globulin, first priority going to mothers the two weeks before Christmas. Laura shook her head vigorously, clearing it of such nonsense. Just look at that list! A week before Christmas, and all those plans and preparations left untouched or unfinished. "All on account of Alexander Graham Bell, anyway," she sighed, debating through four 32 for Christmas Lucy Parr rings whether to ignore the pealing telephone. If one more person had one more suggestion. "Good morning." She never could ignore the magnetism of that bell. "Yes—yes, this is the Redding residence. Doctor who?" Laura listened, dazed, as this voice, this Dr. Seaton, explained. Personal physician to Laura's Aunt Elva Haney, he was calling from Danville. Aunt Elva, nearing seventy-five, had fallen on a patch of ice, broken a wrist, and been shaken up somewhat. "She has been here at the hospital since Thursday," the doctor went on. "But she should have let us know." "Insisted she didn't want to be a nuisance," Dr. Seaton said briskly. "It was with some reluctance, because of the busy season, that she gave me your name as the family member living near." The doctor paused, and Laura waited, her mind refusing to function beyond the knowledge that this call spelled emergency, just that way, in bold letters. "Mrs. Haney will be able to leave the hospital by tomorrow," the man said, "if... Well, I feel that she should not try to go home alone these first days. Might you come and take her home with you for a brief visit?" "I—well, I" Laura shook her head as if recovering from a blow. "Yes, Dr. Seaton. Of course, I'll come. In the morning about ten." The receiver fell back in its cradle, as rebellion arose in her mind. "I can't! Oh, I won't." But immediately she thought, "I can. I must. I will." But how could she? So little time. So many things yet to be accomplished. How to take a half day tomorrow to drive the fifty miles to Danville and bring Aunt Elva back? How to find time for rearranging their lives to accommodate an old lady? Laura slumped to a chair.

Why couldn't this have waited just a little longer, when the holiday rush was over? "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me." (Matt. 25:40.) Laura sat up with a start. Could she have become so self-centered as to think of her own convenience when a loved one needed help! Aunt Elva and Uncle Gib hadn't thought of convenience those summers long ago, when as many as a dozen of the cousins had converged on the farm at Make Room for Christmas once. Aunt Elva had cooked and cleaned and removed slivers—and comforted in the night. And she had smiled as she did it. Childless, she now had no one to turn to except those tousled, mischievous, nieces and nephews. "T will!" Laura said firmly, and got to her feet. Sherene could move in with Cindy for as long as necessary. She would fuss a bit, but that front bedroom would be more pleasant for Aunt Elva, with its view of the street. How pampered they had become, that she should feel hesitant about suggesting that the girls share a room. Quickly, Laura went about her work, trying to push the panic of the Christmas rush from her mind, thinking of the things that must be done in preparation for Aunt Elva's arrival. From somewhere she would just have to find the time, and strength, to see them through these next few days.

Loaura waited until dessert time that night to make her announcement. Jonathan looked up, surprised. "Think you can swing it, honey?" "T have to swing it," Laura answered. "But why, Mom?" Sherene demanded, upon learning about the room arrangement. "It's not fair. Everything's just the way I like it, and now you." Hurriedly, Laura explained her reasons, her firmness cutting further complaints to a minimum.

After the first announcement, Jimmy exhibited boredom about the entire subject. Only five-year-old Cindy showed anything but reluctance. 33 January 1969

"Oh, I think that will be fun, to have a grandma-age lady at our house." Her friend Pamela had a grandmother to visit, which fascinated Cindy.

It was late afternoon the following day before Laura returned from Danville with Aunt Elva, two hours longer than she had budgeted for the trip. With an effort, she fought back the panic that kept pushing at her, helping Aunt Elva to get settled in the front bedroom. Dinner was a quickly-assembled noodle casserole and canned biscuits.

"Aw, Mom," Jimmy complained, "I never did like slippery dinners. Why can't we have a real...?" Laura silenced him with a glare, and they finished the meal in reasonable peace.

Before Laura could suggest a helping hand with the dishes, a horn sounded and Sherene grabbed her coat. "That's Mrs. Webb. She's driving us to our practice for the pageant. I'll be back before nine." Home to a teenager often was little more than a convenient filling station, Laura thought in resignation. And command post, she added, as Sherene turned at the door to remind, "Don't forget—I have to have my costume by Tuesday."

And now Jimmy reminded her, "And the cookies you promised for our Cub Scout Christmas party." Laura nodded, wanting to press her hands tightly over her ears, as Cindy did when refusing to hear a reprimand. But at least Jimmy's was one party which, mercifully, she hadn't been burdened with this time around.

"I do wish I might lend a hand," Aunt Elva apologized, as Laura began clearing away the dishes. "But this cast." "Of course you're not to help," Laura insisted. "You're our guest."

After a time, she felt rising impatience with the way Aunt Elva persisted in a constant reiteration of the past, the simple holiday celebrations when the families had gathered at Grandmother Dalton's place, each bringing a part of the meal and a great measure of anticipation.

"Remember Uncle Anson and his fiddle, do you?" the old lady queried. "The hours we spent, just hearing the Christmas songs over and over again. My, the way that man could bring the peace of Christmas right into the room to abide with us." She sighed. "Even during those depression years, when fear walked a few paces behind so many folks...."

Then Aunt Elva smiled. "And Aunt Melinda—every year it was the same. A handmade pincushion for every niece in the family."

Remembering, Laura laughed. "And Uncle Harmon, measuring each one of us kids to his belt buckle, that one day, every year. The size of Uncle Harm, both up and around, made it entirely plausible to me that giants walked the earth."

Abruptly, Laura turned away. Sure, it had been good. But standing here reminiscing didn't get her own Christmas preparations finished on time.

Grandma hadn't known about Cub Scouts, or a myriad other things that waited for Laura's attention. Before excusing herself for the night, Aunt Elva insisted, "I've not bothered much about breakfast in the years since Uncle Gib died, since I moved to that apartment in town. So, if you don't mind, dear, I'll just sleep in a bit."

"You'll do no such thing," the old lady declared. "Should I feel hungry, I can help myself to a glass of milk." Laura did not argue, though she wondered if this was Aunt Elva's way of giving them an opportunity to untangle the family for the morning, without a strange presence imposing.

At breakfast, the children were almost rude in their demands. "Mom, just put my costume in a box, so I can carry it easily," Sherene commanded. "I promised Beth that she could see it today, before the others do."

"The costume is not quite finished," Laura said, forcing impatience from her voice. "I'll work at it." "Not finished! Well, crying out loud, you said." "J said I'd try," Laura reminded. "Well, if you hadn't brought that old lady here, then there would be time to do things right."

"Honey," Laura said gently, "that old lady happens to be my aunt, a member of the family—and a member of the human family." "But why did she have to bother now?" Sherene demanded. Jonathan gave the answer that Laura had formed. "Because now is when she is hurt and needs help."

Make Room for Christmas

Swaynson, in those false whiskers and phony voice, pretending to be Santa Claus to a lot of equally ridiculous adults." Until now, she had not admitted, even to herself, how thoroughly bored she had become by these parties. "Jon, honey, at least for this time, you can collect the clever little toys for both of us." Suddenly Jonathan laughed. "Bless you. I'll be home early." And she noted that he was whistling as he backed his car from the garage. With the two older children at last on their way to the final day of school activities, and Cindy absorbed in one of Aunt Elva's 35 January 1969 tales of "the way it used to be," Laura rushed at her work. And then she stopped in alarm. That was just what she was doing—rushing at things—attacking them in her pent-up frustration, close to anger. What were they doing? This normally close family, snapping at each other, tempers frazzled, at a time that should be a joyous celebration. Having Aunt Elva come had cost her most of one precious day. But they had been on this impossible merry-go-round long before Aunt Elva's arrival. What a frightening reflection of their manner of observing Christmas, that Sherene should even think "Well, I'll be glad when all this is over." Where had Christmas gone, the true spirit of Christmas, "the way it used to be," as Aunt Elva had so vividly reminded? Where was the time just to hold close the sacredness of Christmas? It was buried, under an avalanche of unnecessary doing and having. That was where the difference lay. Christmas had once centered around people and spirit, not around things. But we can go back, Laura thought exultantly. We can make room for Christmas, in our hearts and in our lives. Bit by bit, they could cull out the nonessentials and find their way back to the spirit of peace, to the spirit of Christ, which could be found only in the quietness of each human heart.

AT YEAR'S BEGINNING

Great-grandfather's Bible has a special place on his walnut table, a crocheted fan, ribbon run, covers it. This and his "specs," steel-rimmed, in leather case, lie unused all year long. As December middles on to January, the book is opened to the Christmas story. Glasses handy on the page and chair close drawn remind that he once sat, just so,

On Christmas Eve.

Now his third great-grandchildren place a manger scene, turn on the lights. He knew not these—and read anew the old loved story.... Today at year's beginning I put the scene away and close the book again.

—Zara Sabin Norma A. Wrathall

Sometimes, a thing you handled long ago will span the years and carry you, suddenly, into a moment from the past. It was so with the bone hairpins, which I happened to find in the wooden box in which they were kept. Mama always used bone hairpins to hold her long wavy hair in place, coiled smoothly on top of her head. She said that wire hairpins scratched the hair and roughened it, and furthermore, couldn't be depended upon to hold firmly. I never recall seeing a wire hairpin in her hair at any time, nor did she ever wear a net. At night, the rich brown locks were combed to smoothness and braided into a long braid. Next morning, her hair was combed out, coiled softly, and pinned up before she ever set foot into the kitchen at six-thirty or so, to begin her day's work. Mama spent very little time, actually, caring for her hair, or for any other personal thing. She didn't have the time to spare. But every two weeks, she prepared to wash her hair, using rain water that was collected in a big barrel under the water spout during summer rains, or melted snow in winter. Lacking either of these, ditch water was used, after it had been dipped into a tub and the sediment allowed to settle out for at least a day. The ditch water came from melting snow in the mountains. We lived in a hard-water area, and this was before the days of water-softening compounds or bubbly shampoos. Mama would shave part of a bar of Packer's Tar Soap into a small pan, put some water with it, and let it stand on the back of the wood-and-coal range to melt, while she put a big pan of water on the front of the stove to heat, and spread newspapers over the middle part of the kitchen floor. Looking back, I wonder that she wasn't entitled to a bit of privacy; but my sister and I always watched her, sometimes handing the soap pan, or an extra towel, if needed.

Her. I'm still trying. In my opinion she is a perfect mother, and I know her children agree with me. They are her most important possessions and they know it. She is always patient and friendly towards them. They love her and are obedient because they love to please her. She takes time to listen to their problems and always tries to help them find a solution. She is constantly on the alert for teaching opportunities. She arises early and goes to bed late in order to keep her house in order. My friend is a tremendously spiritual person. She loves our Heavenly Father and she lives very close to him. She acknowledges his help in everything she does. She has a strong testimony of the gospel and never makes excuses for not living it. She firmly believes that we can do whatever the Lord asks us to do and she does it cheerfully. I will never forget a missionary conference where she bore her testimony. Our husbands worked together in the stake mission presidency and had been required to spend many hours away from home the previous few weeks. I had only two small children, but I had been feeling sorry for myself. During the conference, several stake missionaries and their wives bore their testimonies and then excused themselves for not having put in the expected number of hours by saying that their families needed them. In my heart I knew this was not right, but I nodded in agreement and wished my husband felt the same way. Then my friend stood, and with tears in her eyes, told how difficult it was for her to rear her children (seven now) with her husband gone so much. "But," she said, "I have found that if I do not complain and cheerfully let him go and do the work I know the Lord wants him to do, the Lord sends a special spirit into our home that takes the place of our father and priesthood bearer. This spirit protects, comforts, and helps me just as my husband would if he were at home."

My friend has so many wonderful qualities that it would take a whole book to tell all of them, but I must tell one more because it is so very rare.

When I had only known her a few weeks, I began telling her why I didn't like a neighbor. Instead of sympathizing with me and adding her own disparaging remarks, she said, "Well, I have known her for a long time and I'm sure when you really get to know her, you'll like her, too." I soon learned not to speak against anyone in her presence. She didn't dislike anyone. If someone did something of which she didn't approve, she would try to find out the motive. If she couldn't uncover a justifiable excuse, she would still not condemn.

My friend and I are separated by a thousand miles now and I miss her terribly. Whenever I have a spiritual experience or learn a new gospel truth, I long to call her and share it with her, knowing she would understand and truly rejoice with me. When I have a new discipline problem with my children or discover a successful way to manage them, I wish I could lift the receiver and say to her, "Do you have a minute to talk?" 43 WHO WILL SHOW HER HOW? Dorothy F. Condry

When my sister, Norma, came to see me last week, she handed me an old shoebox tied with string, saying, "I went by Aunt Cora's the other day and found her rummaging through her cedar chest. Suddenly she pulled out this box and handed it to me. I didn't know what to do with it, so I brought it to you."

"What in the world is it?" I asked.

"Why don't you open it and find out?"

I untied the string and lifted the lid. The box was literally filled with exquisite tatting, in a combination of blue and white thread.

"How beautiful!" I exclaimed.

"Isn't it!" Norma agreed.

As I carefully examined the contents, I discovered a number of bundles of completed circles of tatted edging, tied together according to size. At the very bottom of the box were several linen doilies to which some of the lace had been sewed. What a lovely table setting this would make! There would be doilies large enough to use under platters and small enough for tumblers, along with several in-between sizes.

"Grandma Dyer made the tatting for Aunt Cora years ago," Norma informed me. (Aunt Cora is now ninety years old.) "I thought it might be her work. It looks as though whoever started sewing the edging onto the doilies didn't keep at it very long."

"Oh, Aunt Cora was supposed to do that," Norma explained. "She didn't tell me why she gave up on the job, but I imagine it was for the same reason I don't want to tackle it—it's just too much needlework." Then she added, quickly, "But you have a lot of patience, Dorothy. Why don't you finish the set? It's yours, if you do!"

"Thanks for the compliment—and the tatting. I suppose you knew I would accept your challenge. I only wish it had come sooner. That good old arthritis is really bothering my hands these days."

As I undertake to complete this project on which Grandmother Dyer's fingers worked so diligently those many years ago, I am well aware of what a tedious task it will be. The linen circles first have to be finished with narrow, carefully rolled hems before the tatting can be sewed on with tiny stitches. But it will make such a gorgeous luncheon set, I am bound and determined to finish it—and in time to use it myself!

Why? Because I'm not at all sure any of my children, or grandchildren, would appreciate, or even care to own, this, their great-grandmother's heirloom. Girls today, our young homemakers and mothers, show little interest in handwork. Embroidering and tatting are rapidly becoming lost arts.

The other day I asked my young daughter-in-law, "Don't you want me to teach you how to tat?" She shrugged her shoulders and merely replied, "Plastic doilies suit me just fine. They're so easy to keep clean, too."

"But you have so many more gadgets to help with your housework than I did when I was your age, how is it I had time for handwork and you don't?"

She looked at me a full minute, carefully weighing her reply.

"When your mother was young, and even when you were my age, a mother was more or less relegated to her kitchen, or at least to one corner of the parlor, when politics, or public affairs were under discussion. A woman just wasn't supposed to know about such things, and her opinion was seldom sought on matters outside the home. Her opportunity for self-expression was what she could make with her hands. That's why. She spent so much time doing handwork."

"Times have changed. Young mothers today are well-educated and are expected to have opinions on important matters. The radio and TV help us keep posted on local and world news as we go about our housework. We are encouraged to participate in community projects and to vote in political contests. We have innumerable opportunities for self-expression and no longer need to keep our opinions and personalities bottled up while we sit in a corner and knit."

As she finished speaking, I just sat there, speechless.

"Please don't think I'm being rude," she quickly apologized. "But that's my answer to your question." I had to admit there was much truth in her explanation, but it left me feeling completely defeated in my effort to promote in her life what has so enriched mine.

When I was only twelve, my neighbor's fifteen-year-old niece came visiting. One day, as I watched her knitting, I asked if she would show me how. She was more than willing and proved an excellent teacher. I soon learned how to knit and also how to crochet. My mother had previously shown me how to embroider, and a few years later my grandmother helped me master the art of tatting.

I have thoroughly enjoyed these accomplishments through the years, and proudly use my handmade garments and home decorations. But now I find myself wondering—will these tokens of my efforts towards self-expression which I prize so highly be unappreciated and a lost art in the not too distant future? Recently, when my father's sister passed on, I became heir to some lovely doilies with drawn threads and intricate stitches—different from any I know how to make. There are also several centerpieces with edging made by combining crocheting and various kinds of braid, such as rickrack and coronation braid. I figured out how to make the edging, but the drawn work has me puzzled, and I know of no one who can show me how it was done.

As I studied over that lovely needlework, which, to me, is a lost art, I couldn't help wondering, suppose some day my granddaughter looks with admiring eyes at a piece of my handwork, and has a desire to learn how it was made, will there be anyone around who can show her how? THE DOLL WOMAN Widowed these years, and childless years before, she collects dolls. Ranged on window ledge, on door lintel, their bright bland faces vaguely smile or pout in miniature childishness, the while their moving or painted eyes in simulated candor look from each corner; their mock-animated poses liven every nook and shelf. She moves among them, lavishing herself in care of them. Each child-facsimile is carefully posed, arranged; daily she dusts each elf, each pretty puppet, lifeless eternally— for the children, oh, the children! —they flock to her from miles around, to touch, to exclaim, to see! —Katherine F. Larsen

45 Welcome The Task Chapter 3 Synopsis: Jennifer Miles, disquieted by a discussion with Steve Rey, the young man she had been dating, has gone to Houston to visit her mother's widowed cousin, Bea McPherson. Bea's stepson arranges for Jennifer to go on a blind date to the Astrodome.

@ Bea seemed amused by the look on Jennifer's pretty young face. "Now what could you have done that is so bad?" she asked smilingly. Jennifer kicked her shoes off. "Oh, Bea, have you ever laid eyes on that Jim Long?"

"Jimmy Long has been in the ward for a number of years, and he is good looking. Have you fallen for him already?" "Well, I could, given half a chance. And I guess I did sort of flirt with him a little." "You were just dazzled by all those white teeth and those blue eyes of his. How did you and Michele Bartmess as told by Annette Giles get along, or did you?"

Bea asked. "Well, it was nothing spectacular," Jennifer commented. "He is very pleasant, and extremely nice, but we didn't really hit it off. Perhaps I'm too young for him." "It is possible. Well, you run along and get some sleep, and dream about Jim, for we'll be seeing him in church tomorrow."

They did see Jim Long in church, and at many other places, too, for he was as interested in Jennifer as she was in him. He spent a great deal of time at Bea's home, after work, and he took Jennifer to some interesting places. Bea loved entertaining, and it was always easy to find a number of people who would enjoy steaks cooked out of doors and swimming in the large, lovely pool.

Jennifer delighted in attending church meetings in the mission field, for it seemed that being a member of a minority group pulled the members closer together. The singing of the hymns was enthusiastic, and Jennifer loved listening to Jim's excellent voice as she sat proudly beside him. She decided to send Steve a card and note, just to see if he would respond. She told him about the many things she was doing, but not with whom. She hoped he was having a good summer, although, she thought rather guiltily, working on construction was hot, tiring work.

She was both pleased and surprised to receive a letter from him the very next day, indicating that he had written even before she did. "Jenny, how is your mother's heart condition?" Bea inquired one afternoon. Jennifer's face clouded. "Well, the doctor at home says that he doesn't think he wants to operate." "Doesn't think!" Bea exploded. "Such indecision." "That's about how we feel. We want a definite answer from him about how Mother really is. It hurts to know that she suffers so much, yet never complains. She never has, but without an operation, she won't improve."

"She is one in a million," Bea said sincerely. "And she has reared quite a family." Jennifer colored. "We aren't quite reared yet. Sam is just twelve." "Just how are those three boys doing?" Bea asked. "They are quite a trio." Welcome the Task Jennifer thought of her three brothers, and wondered if anything should happen to her mother, what she would do? "Dave will be a junior this fall, and is quite a football player." "I knew your father would make one out of him," Bea said thoughtfully. "Yes, Dad has really helped and encouraged him all the way. Pete is a ninth grader, and, at times, quite a menace. Just before I left, he was using the freezer outlet in the garage for the heater for his pigeons, and he forgot to plug the freezer back in. When we discovered it, everything was floating."

"Oh, dear, was it a total loss?" "You know Mother, she gave some of the meat and vegetables to the Relief Society, it was really good meat, and she gave some to the neighbors, and was able to get a little remuneration for some of it. Still, it badly depleted the supply. Pete is really sorry, but he has to learn to think." "They all go through that stage," Bea commented. "Sam's a dear," Jennifer told her. "He will be in the sixth grade, and is smart as a whip. He has a temper to go along with that red hair of his, but Mother is working on that, too."

Just talking about her family made Jennifer miss them. She had been in Houston a month, and was enjoying every minute of it, but thoughts of home often pulled at her heartstrings. "How long are you staying here?" Jim inquired, as he assisted her into his bright blue sports car.

47 January 1969 "Bea wants me to remain until Labor Day," she smiled up at him, still somewhat dazzled by his good looks. "So do I, and longer if you would." "I'm a student, remember. School starts in September, and I've yet to discover a way of attending by proxy."

"I've yet to figure a way of keeping you here, but I'm working on it," Jim said, looking at her fondly. "You're smart enough already, Jenny. You don't need any more education. And you've done a world of good to Bea." Jennifer tried to put the skids on her wildly beating heart, for she was normally a level-headed girl and didn't want to ruin that reputation by falling for a young man so fast. Besides, she was afraid that Jim was the kind of man who dropped a girl as soon as he was certain that she was thoroughly and completely captivated by him.

She steered the conversation to what she hoped was a safer topic. "What about your school plans, Jim? I know that you are in pre-law." Jim loved to talk about himself, this Jennifer knew. "Well, I have one more semester here. Then I think I will go out to Utah." He looked at her meaningfully.

Jennifer decided that she had steered the conversation the wrong way. Keep your cool, she thought to herself. Keep him talking about himself. Don't let all those good looks and that easy flattery of his go to your head.

After all, you've known him scarcely a month; let it not be said that Jennifer Miles was swept off her feet, neither let it be said that she was a fool and deserved a broken heart. It only took a few questions to get Jim again talking about himself. He had his future well in mind, and he was planning to get ahead in the world. He was brilliant, but most of all he was determined. Jennifer wondered if he might not be above stepping on a few toes to get what he wanted. The one big difference between her and Jim, she decided, was that money, position, and appearances were quite important to him, while to her they were secondary.

It seemed that whenever there was a party at Bea's, Dick Craddock was there. Jennifer, although wrapped up in her own life, had not failed to notice that he was very attentive to Bea, in a mature, interested way. Some of the great sadness seemed to have left his eyes. It fell into pattern when Paula mentioned one evening that she thought Bea and Dick were good for one another.

"What do you mean?" Jennifer asked absently.

"They have both lost the one they love," Paula replied.

Jennifer's interest picked up. "Oh, really, is Dick a widower?"

Paula told her that Dick had lost his wife and two-year-old son in an automobile accident, in which he had been only slightly injured. Although the other driver had clearly been at fault, Dick had gone on blaming himself through many years.

Bea's good humor and infectious happiness, despite her trials, had made him apparently forget his own sadness a little, and he had mellowed a great deal toward his fellow workers. He always seemed genuinely concerned to see that Bea had an enjoyable time, and helped her as hostess.

"Of course," Paula said, "he hasn't rushed with any romantic overtures, but they certainly do seem to enjoy one another's company very much."

After that Jennifer was aware that there did seem to be an attraction between her cousin and the man with whom she had had a date the evening she first met Jim. She had been dating Jim for two months when he inquired as to the other men in her life, quite casually, and offhandedly.

Apparently her moment's hesitation made him think that there might be someone back in Utah. Although Jennifer had not thought too seriously of Steve throughout the summer, it made her bristle slightly to have Jim say matter-of-factly, "Well I'll be keeping you busy when I reach Utah in February."

Somehow she felt as though he was indicating that he was unconcerned that there was anyone who could possibly be competition, and that Jennifer might prefer to make her own decision. This sent her on a sentimental journey.

In her mind she saw Steve as an elder, bearing a humble, moving testimony; on Diversion Day, at Stratford Upon Avon, so impressed and interested; the night of his farewell at the mission home, asking her if she would write. There was Steve at a football game, excited and engrossed; at a play, comprehending the message and art; Welcome the Task Steve across from her in the library, intent on his writing, serious and thoughtful, never quite satisfied.

The memories could go on and on. She could see Steve with his mother, so devoted, or romping in the yard with her brothers, flushed and laughing, his blonde head gleaming with perspiration. For more than two years they had shared so much. How she suddenly yearned to see him.

Of course, to be fair, she had to admit that Jim had devoted a great deal more of his time to her in the two months than Steve ever would, but this was summer, and Jim wasn't forced to work long, hot hours to put himself through school, nor did he have a widowed mother to whom he felt an obligation.

"Why," she thought, "am I defending Steve so, and against what? I am afraid, my dear Mr. Long, there is competition, or at least I hope so."

Jim interrupted her silent thoughts. "You're awfully quiet, Jenny." She could think of no clever reply, so she merely smiled and said, "I'm sorry, I was just thinking."

"Of the past, present, or the future?" he questioned.

"A little of each," she confessed, without looking at Jim.

"Hmm," he said. "How about just the present for now?"

O. A rare evening when Bea prepared a meal to be eaten inside, she invited the bishop and his wife over. The bishop was well-known throughout the area as Dr. Hopper, director of the famed Texas Medical Center, one of the leaders in the field of heart disease and internal medicine.

"Perhaps it would be possible to arrange for the surgery."

The bishop was indeed an impressive man, Jennifer thought. Eventually the conversation got around to the topic of Elizabeth Miles' heart condition. He seemed very interested, and asked Jennifer several questions.

A little while later he said, "Jennifer, do you think that your mother might be willing to risk major heart surgery of a kind that hasn't been performed too many times on humans yet, but has been very successful?"

"Yes, I really think she would," Bishop. Why?"

"Have you ever heard of Dr. Benjamin Mayhew?" Jennifer had not, but Bea had, and was impressed.

Dr. Mayhew was one of the world's foremost heart specialists. Jennifer caught on, just as the bishop was saying, "I'm not certain, but it might be possible that we could arrange for your mother to undergo surgery here in Houston, providing she is fit, of course. This would require an examination, but Dr. Mayhew has been interested in performing a mitro operation."

Jennifer's heart raced. This man was director of the hospital; perhaps it would be possible, he had said, to arrange for the surgery. It wasn't certain, but...

That night Jennifer prayed fervently that things could be worked out so that her mother could be relieved of her misery. Jennifer realized that it might mean that she must drop out of school for awhile, but it would be well worth it. It would also mean that she was going to have to remain in Houston at least until it was decided whether Dr. Mayhew still wanted to perform such an operation.

Of course there was the question of whether the family wished to take the risk. There were many matters to be settled, but this seemed to Jennifer to be the answer to many prayers.

Northern Hemisphere: First Meeting, April 1969
Southern Hemisphere: September 1969

OBJECTIVE: The Latter-day Saint woman seeks to understand better how she may keep from being deceived by evil spirits.

INTRODUCTION A principal belief of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is that heavenly messengers minister today. When the mob in Jackson County, Missouri, issued a manifesto invoking the saints to leave that place under threat of death, it stated that the Mormons openly blasphemed God because they believed in direct communication from heaven. (Joseph Smith, History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, ed. B. H. Roberts; Salt Lake City: The Deseret Book Company, 1946, Vol. 1, pp. 374-376 [commonly called Documentary History of the Church; hereafter referred to as DHC].) Why should professed "Christian" people denounce the basic Bible teaching that communication from heaven may come through various media of revelation: visions, dreams, angels, and so forth? The Bible gives many examples of the ministration of holy beings from the other side of the veil. From the Old Testament we learn of many such 59 January 1969 examples. (Genesis 16:7-11; 22: 11-12; Exodus 3:2; Daniel 6:22.) Several accounts are also recorded in the New Testament. (Luke 1:11-13, 28; 22:43; Acts 1:10; 5:18-19.) Whenever a gospel dispensation has been on the earth, communication from heaven has been received from angels, as well as by other media of revelation.

THE RESTORATION OF THE GOSPEL

The fundamental Bible belief that God will direct his people today, as well as in the past, was renewed with the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. This doctrine, affirmed by example and by the witness of the Holy Ghost, has given new hope and faith in the Bible and in the justice of God. Latter-day Saints teach that the Church has been restored by direct revelation from heaven, and that the authority to perform ordinances of salvation has been given by angelic personages from heaven. The Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthoods were thus restored. (D&C 27:7-8, 12-13.) Elijah, Elias, and Moses conferred their keys of authority upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in the Kirtland Temple, on April 3, 1836. Ancient prophets have not only returned to the earth as angels, but they have prophesied the time when angels would minister in the last days. (Malachi 3:1-4; 4:5-6; Revelation 14:6-7.) The restoration of the ancient records of the Nephites by the angel Moroni has given a new book of scripture, which also records the ministry of angels in times past and of their messages concerning today and of the future. (1 Nephi 13 and 14.) The Prophet Joseph Smith became well acquainted with many persons of former dispensations who came as angelic persons to convey messages, powers, and authority. (D&C 128:20-21.)

Class Discussion What makes you believe that the ministry of angels is reasonable and scriptural?

HEAVENLY BEINGS

In vision the Prophet Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon saw the heavenly hosts composed of members of the Godhead and angels. Their testimony is: And we beheld the glory of the Son, on the right hand of the Father, and received of his fulness; and saw the holy angels, and them who are sanctified before His throne, worshipping God, and the Lamb, who worship him forever and ever. (D&C 76:20-21.) Another revelation speaks of two kinds of beings in heaven, namely, resurrected personages with bodies of flesh and bones, and the spirits of just men made perfect. (D&C 129:1-3.) It is also recorded that translated beings serve as heavenly messengers. An example is John the Revelator, the apostle of the Lord, who did not die but is engaged in the work of salvation. (D&C 7.) Among Latter-day Saints, the ministry of the Three Nephites, who are translated beings, is best known. These disciples of the Savior, appointed on the American Continent, desired that they might continue to labor for the salvation of men until the second coming of Christ. (3 Nephi 28.)

WHAT IS AN ANGEL?

Angels are heavenly beings who act in the capacity of envoys, or messengers between heaven and earth. They may be spirits who have never had bodies or spirits whose bodies lie in the grave, or they may be resurrected beings, or translated beings of flesh and bones who must yet die. The Prophet said that all angels who minister to this earth have either lived upon it or will live upon it. (D&C 130:5.) These truths concerning angels point out that angels are individuals with the same body structure as we are, and that they do not have wings, as popularly conceived. (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, Compiled by Joseph Fielding Smith; ninth printing; Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1956, p. 162.) Angels, as translated or resurrected beings, have advanced higher in knowledge and power than spirits, said the Prophet Joseph Smith, and they are subject to God. (DHC 6:51; 5:426-427.) In the meantime, resurrected or translated beings serve as divine messengers until they receive a greater glory, in bringing authority and instruction from God. (DHC 4:575-576). Such an one was Moroni, the custodian of the plates from which has come The Book of Mormon. The Prophet's description of Moroni's first appearance gives some characteristics of a resurrected angel: While I was thus in the act of calling upon God, I discovered a light appearing in my room, which continued to increase until the room was lighter than at noonday, when immediately a personage appeared at my bedside, standing in the air, for his feet did not touch the floor. He had on a loose robe of most exquisitive whiteness.

It was a whiteness beyond anything earthly I had ever seen; nor do I believe that any earthly thing could be made to appear so exceedingly white and brilliant. His hands were naked, and his arms also, a little above the wrist; so, also, were his feet naked, as were his legs, a little above the ankles. His head and neck were also bare. I could discover that he had no other clothing on but this robe, as it was open, so that I could see into his bosom. (Pearl of Great Price, Joseph Smith 2:30-31.)

FALLEN ANGELS

The revelations are clear as to the existence of the devil and his fallen angels. Lucifer rebelled in the premortal world and influenced one-third of the hosts of heaven to follow him, and thus they lost their place among the children of God. (Moses 4:1-3; Revelation 12:4; 2 Peter 2:4; D&C 29:36-38.)

These angels of Satan are personal beings, that is, they are in form and shape as human. Beings are, but of spirit. (D&C 131:7-8.) Evil spirits are sentient beings who have the characteristics of a person. (D&C 10:10-15, 20-27.)

The Lord has revealed the machinations of Satan's hosts toward mankind in order that Latter-day Saints may understand their operations. All evil comes from Satan for he persuadeth no man to do good. (Moroni 7:12, 17.) His desire is to deceive, foster contention, encourage hatred, murder, and to incite men to rage against good. (2 Nephi 9:9; 3 Nephi 11:29; €:2; 2 Nephi 28:7-9, 19-22.)

Satan and the Saints

Those who have made covenants with the Lord in baptism and in the temples are especial targets of Satan's hosts. To destroy the work of the Lord by deceiving the saints is one means by which Satan hopes to gain the victory. (D&C 76:28.) He has organized his forces, set up his kingdom to simulate the genuine in order to deceive the unwary. (DHC 6:364.) His approaches are many and devious, as well described in The Book of Mormon. (2 Nephi 28.)

The Prophet Joseph Smith said: The punishment of the devil was that he should not have a habitation like men. The devil's retaliation is, he comes into this world, binds up men's bodies, and occupies them himself. When the authorities come along, they eject him from a stolen habitation. (DHC 5:403.)

During the ministry of the Savior, evil spirits possessing the bodies of two persons were cast into a herd of swine at the request of the devils. (Matthew 8:28-32.) The first miracle in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was the casting of an evil spirit out of Newel Knight by the Prophet Joseph Smith. When the Prophet rebuked the spirit, Newel spoke out and said that he saw the devil leave him and vanish from his sight. (DHC 1:92-93.)

The Prophet recorded the following about this miracle: This scene was now entirely changed, for as soon as the devil had departed from our friend, his countenance became natural, his distortions of body ceased, and almost immediately the Spirit of the Lord descended upon him, and the visions of eternity were opened to his view. (DHC 1:82-83.)

Existence of Devils

Shortly after the gospel was introduced in England, Elders Heber C. Kimball, Orson Hyde, Willard Richards, and Isaac Russell, were beset by legions of devils who attempted to overcome and destroy these servants of the Lord. The elders heard and saw these spirits. (Orson F. Whitney, Life of Heber C. Kimball, Stevens and Wallis, Inc., Salt Lake City: second ed., 1945, pp. 129-132.)

President Wilford Woodruff had a similar experience in England, but through the intervention of messengers of God, the evil spirits were unable to accomplish their work of destruction. (The Deseret Weekly, November 7, 1896.) Many missionaries have experienced confrontations with evil beings from the unseen world. It seems that the devil is particularly interested in preventing the servants of God from accomplishing their missions.

Knowledge is Necessary

The Prophet once said that a man is saved no faster than he gains knowledge. (DHC 4:588; D&C 131:6.) Then he said: for if he does not get knowledge, he will be brought into captivity by some evil power in the other world, as evil spirits will have more knowledge, and consequently more power than many men who are on the earth. Hence it needs revelation to assist us, and give us knowledge of the things of God. (DHC 4:588.)

Class Discussion

What preparation should a Latter-day Saint make that he may not be deceived?

Bishops

The Lord has placed bishops in the stakes and branch presidents in the missions in his Church to preside over the people in their wards and branches. In their calling, the Lord has said the following: And unto the bishop of the church, and unto such as God shall appoint and ordain to watch over the church and to be elders unto the church, are to have it given unto them to discern all those gifts lest there shall be any among you professing and yet be not of God. (D&C 46:27.)

From the First Presidency instructions come to the stake presidents under whom the bishops in the stakes serve and to the branch presidents in the missions from the mission presidents. In the event the bishops or branch presidents may require counsel from their respective presidents, they may receive help. In a letter to these Church officers, the First Presidency so counseled the members of the Church. They further stated that if these stake and mission officers require the assistance of the First Presidency, they may ask for it, but the members should seek counsel from their local officers.

Implementation

With the restoration of the Church, the same teachings and practices of the gospel were restored. The ministry of angels and the gifts and blessings of the gospel are again on the earth. Ministering angels have come to the earth where a specific need existed. As President Wilford Woodruff, who had received such holy visitants, said, the Lord does not send an angel to a person simply to satisfy curiosity, but rather, to perform a work that only an angel can perform. (The Deseret Weekly, November 7, 1896.)

The members of the Church are principal targets of the Adversary, for if he can deceive them through false doctrines, false practices, and even by the false notion that there is no devil, nor a future existence, nor a judgment, he has gained a tremendous victory. If he can persuade them to believe in the ideas of men rather than the counsel of the leaders of the Church, his ends are attained.

On the other hand, if the saint will seek for the gifts of the Holy Ghost to which he is entitled, he will not be deceived; if he will gain knowledge from the scriptures he will not be deceived; if he will follow the counsel of his Church leaders through the line of authority of the First Presidency, stake presidency, and bishopric, he will find himself on the secure, safe path to peace in this life and eternal life in the world to come. (D&C 59:23.) 

63 VISITING TEACHER MESSAGE — Truths to Live By (Correlated With the Family Home Evening Manual, 1968-69) Message 7—"'... And I, the Lord, Remember Them No More." (D&C 58:42.)

Alice Colton Smith

Northern Hemisphere: First Meeting, April 1969
Southern Hemisphere: September 1969

OBJECTIVE: To understand that true repentance results in complete forgiveness by the Lord.

One afternoon a mission president sent to his wife for additional counseling a young lady missionary. The young missionary was heartbroken over a sin that she had committed. In her grief she sobbed, "I can never be forgiven, I can never forgive myself. I have forfeited all chance to be accepted in the celestial kingdom."

Nearly two thousand years ago, a woman stood before Jesus. She was condemned of one of the most serious crimes, one that struck at the heart of the family. Her accusers were adamant. She must pay the prescribed penalty. She must die. She was a sinner taken in the act.

When the scribes and Pharisees pressed him for judgment, Jesus replied, "He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her." (John 8:7.)

One by one her accusers stole away. When all had left, Jesus said unto her:... Woman, where are those thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee?

She said, No man, Lord.

And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.

Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. (John 8:10-12.)

Jesus pointed the way to true repentance and forgiveness for us all, the way out of darkness into light, when he said, "go, and sin no more."

We are to turn away from evil, struggle against our sins until they are overcome, and seek only the good.

Alma, the younger, said of himself, "... I had rebelled against my God; I had not kept his holy commandments. Yea, and I had murdered many of his children, or rather led them away unto destruction." (Alma 36:13-14.)

As he learned the meaning of repentance and God's graciousness, he said, "Behold, he sendeth an invitation unto all men, for the arms of mercy are extended towards them, and he saith: 'Repent, and I will receive you." (Alma 5:33.)

In Isaiah, we read: Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. (Isaiah 1:18.)

In our day, the Lord said, "By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins—behold, he will confess them and forsake them." (D&C 58:43.)

(Italics —E———— Lesson Department added.) "Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more." (D&C 58:42.)

If the Lord forgives and remembers our sins no more after we have repented, can we forgive ourselves and remember our sins no more? Can we forgive repentant others their sins and remember them no more?

Discussion 7—Let's Go Inside Celestia J. Taylor

Northern Hemisphere: Second Meeting, April 1969
Southern Hemisphere: August 1969

OBJECTIVE: To point out ways to beautify our home interiors, with emphasis on picture groupings and other wall accessories.

INTRODUCTION

One of the reasons why our homes reflect the personality of those who live in them is that we surround ourselves with the things we love, the things which complement ourselves, and the things which satisfy our yearnings for what to us is beautiful. Naturally, our foremost concern is to make the interiors of our homes as comfortable and inviting as possible, but for one reason or another we sometimes fail to achieve these ends.

Since not all of us are endowed with the gift of knowing exactly what to do and how to do it, we need a few guiding principles which will help us in the choice and arrangement of the things we put in our homes. We may differ in our cultural heritage and in our national and climatic environments, but the underlying problems are the same.

With the application of these principles and a little imagination, we can create a home which is not only individually our own but which is also beautiful and in good taste.

In this discussion we might say that good taste is the orderly arrangement of details which suit the function and design of the surroundings and are pleasing to look at. Sometimes the little things make all the difference.

Interior 65 January 1969 decorators are unanimous in their conclusion that the pictures and books, in particular, are of great importance in the home, not only for their decorative value but also for their contribution as denominators of the intellect and personality of the owners. Emphasis in this discussion will be focused on these "little things," the things we put on our walls—pictures, decorative hangings, mirrors, etc.

HOW SHALL WE CHOOSE OUR WALL ACCESSORIES?

1. By our personal taste. Our selection of wall accessories depends first of all upon our personal likes and dislikes—what we see on our walls certainly ought to be things we like and appreciate. However, in our selection and use of them we should constantly seek ways to grow in our knowledge and appreciation of what is good taste. This we can do by reading widely in current magazines and books, by observing beautiful homes (open houses, homes of friends, etc.), and by taking classes when possible.

2. By their suitability. The wrong kind of wall accessory or even the right kind in the wrong place can do much to mar the beauty and good taste of any room. Our choices should be suitable (1) to the wall space, (2) to the room, and (3) to the family's mode of living.

A. (1) Walls which already have scenic wallpaper or strongly-patterned paper do not require additional enrichment. A plain, neutral surface offers a good background for pictures or other decorative features.

(2) A picture or hanging of unusual decorative or esthetic value should be given ample wall space.

(The Oriental tradition of restraint—the use of only one picture or object of great beauty in a given space—is well recognized and commended.) 66 (3) Where numerous pictures of varying sizes and shapes are used, it is advisable to group them in close proximity so that they appear as a single unit, or in simple geometric arrangement to suit the particular space (stepladder grouping for stairway, straight-line grouping over sofa or chest, etc.) (4) To create an illusion of greater space or to accentuate particular centers of interest, mirrors are invaluable. B. Wall accessories should complement the room in which they are used in subject matter, style, and color. (1) They should harmonize with the entire room scheme (Any accessory which presents a note of discord should be eliminated.) (2) They should bring points of interest to the room. (3) They should add to the atmosphere or mood—gay, vivid subjects and colors; restful, soothing ones; those suitable for children or for grownups, depending on location, etc. (4) They should be appropriate to the room in size and style. (A small room should not be overpowered by a large, massive wall accessory, nor should a large room be cluttered with small insignificant ones.) To Discuss 1. How can I determine whether or not my home is in good taste? (Advise the use of magazines, libraries, and observation.) 2. How can those of us who have little means apply these principles to our homes? (Make it clear that money is not the criterion of either beauty or good taste—sometimes quite the opposite). 3. How can we develop good taste in our children? (Encourage children to be creative in the decorating of their own rooms.) CONCLUSION If we want our homes to be more than just a place for shelter, eating, and sleeping; just an en- closure to keep out inclement must be willing to put forth the elements—if we want our homes necessary effort in thought, study, to be a joy and an inspiration and planning which it takes to to provide peace and contentment make them places of beauty and uplift to our spirits—then we good taste. SOCIAL RELATIONS—Immortality and Eternal Life Lesson 7—"Not Where You Serve, But How" Alberta H. Christensen (Reference: Immortality and Eternal Life From the Writings and Messages of President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., Melchizedek Priesthood Manual, 1968-69) Northern Hemisphere: Third Meeting, April 1969 Southern Hemisphere: September 1969 OBJECTIVE: To stress the importance of President Clark's Statement, "In the service of the Lord, it is not where you serve, but how."* INTRODUCTION including that great area of priest- hood authority which is fundamental to the gospel of Jesus Christ. In a General Conference of the Church, April 9, 1951. The importance of the statement for all our Father's spirit children who serve in the Church and, particularly, to the Latter-day Saint woman, is the concern of their mortal birth. Of Abraham this lesson. We read: Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among these there were many of the noble and great ones: And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were organized before the world was, and hesaw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born. (Abraham 3:22-23.) The statement by President Clark, "... Not where you serve, but how," has important meaning for the Latter-day Saint woman, for she is familiar with the framework of Church organization and is, generally, aware of the numerous positions to be filled in order that the objectives of the Church may be accomplished. She may have had occasion to consider or may have held such positions in the ward as Relief Society president, class leader, special committee chairman, or may have been an administrative officer in the Primary or Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association. One of the great strengths of the organization of the Church lies in the numerous opportunities for leadership service offered to its general membership. Leadership assignments are for unspecified, sometimes short, periods of time, then other individuals are called to fill the vacant positions. Questions for Discussion (a) What are the values to the Church of this leadership rotation? (b) To the individual? GENERAL QUALIFICATIONS OF LEADERSHIP Question for Discussion What are some general qualifications for effective leadership? In addition to the general qualifications for effective leadership, such as: understanding the assignment, personal integrity, enthusiasm, ability to inspire, often there are specific qualifications needed for a particular leadership assignment. Examples are seen in the differing requirements for the following callings: ward Scoutmaster; stake patriarch; ward or stake Relief Society president; MIA dance director. (Other examples may be suggested.) IMPORTANCE OF "FOLLOWERSHIP" Question for Discussion How important is "followership"? Much has been said and written relative to successful leadership about the qualifications required of one who outlines the pattern for performance, of the qualities which the leader must demonstrate if she is to inspire and motivate others to follow. We speak of the personal qualities which strengthen the relationship between the few in number who map the course, and that numerous host who walk the charted road. But if to serve means to give aid, to help another, do they not also serve who follow? In an address to Relief Society sisters in a Relief Society Annual General Conference, President Clark said: I pray God to bless you, to bless you who preside and you who serve, and it is as blessed to serve as it is to preside, and with infinitely less responsibility. The humblest man, and the humblest woman, doing his duty in the place in which he is called to work, will deserve and receive just as much reward as the man who so serves and so acts in the highest position. The Lord always used the poor of the earth to illustrate how men should live. (President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., "The Prophet's Sailing Orders to Relief Society," The Relief Society Magazine, December 1949, p.

798.) The poet Milton wrote, "They also serve who only stand and wait" —applicable where enduring patience may be the needed virtue; a virtue manifest in the faithful soldier, waiting and watching through the long hours of the night, or the captain of a ship, who, not thinking of himself, waits until all passengers are safe in the lifeboats; a virtue which was not evidenced in the undependable watchman on the tower. (D&C 101:44-55.)

NOT WHERE, BUT HOW

Question for Discussion
If those who follow also serve, what is the human denominator which makes a difference in the quality of service? Much less, perhaps, has been written about the requirements for effective "followership" than about the qualifications of those who lead. Yet, "followership" also is important, and there is a factor in the rendering of service, wherever that service may be, which may make the difference between the partial or total success of any enterprise. It also may make the difference between personal growth and complacent mediocrity.

Willingness to accept counsel, to do whatever one is called to do in the service of the Lord, as opposed to reluctant, half-hearted compliance, may be the differing factor. Thus, it is not where one serves, but the spirit and diligence with which one serves that are all important. Nor is there any place, in the service to the Church, for honor-seeking or an attitude of jealousy, on the part of either those who lead or those who follow.

Lesson Department

For Class Consideration
Discuss the importance of attitude in the service a woman renders (a) her family; (b) her friends; (c) any position she may hold in the Church. Only when wisely directed leadership is matched by wise and dedicated "followership" may we hope for completely successful results.

The application of this principle is clearly evident in the successful operation of a ward or stake Relief Society. The message of the beautifully expressed address commemorating the coming of the Mormon pioneers 100 years before, delivered by President Clark at a session of the General Conference of the Church, October 5, 1947, is relevant to this statement.

Speaking of those who were of that "great trek, the mightiest trek that history records since Israel's flight from Egypt," President Clark pays impressive and humble tribute to: 

"especially to the meekest and lowliest of them, those great souls, majestic in the simplicity of their faith and in their living testimony of the truth of the restored gospel, to those souls in name unknown, unremembered, unhonored in the pages of history, but lovingly revered round the hearthstones of their children and their children's children who pass down from generation to generation the story of their faith and their mighty works, and the righteousness of their lives and living. Those souls who worked and worked, and prayed and followed, and wrought so gloriously."

It would not take away one word of praise or gratitude, honor or reverence from the great men who led these humble ones of ours. They were mighty men in brain and brawn, in courage and valor, in honesty and in love of truth, living near the Lord—Brothers Brigham and Heber and Wilford and Willard and Charles, the two Orsons and Parley and John and George and Erastus and Lorenzo and Daniel and Joseph and Jedediah, and a host of other giants, each and all richly blessed with the Lord's divine love and with that gift of the Holy Ghost that made them leaders truly like unto Moses of old. I yield, we yield, to no one in our gratitude for them and for their work of directing the conquest of the wilderness and of saving men's souls. Their names shine lustrously on those pages of history which record only the doings of the makers of epochs—those choice spirits, chosen before the foundation of the world, to be the leaders and builders of dispensations of God's dealings with men; and these leaders of ours to be the builders of that dispensation which of old was named the Dispensation of the Fullness of Time. Unnumbered eternities will remember and honor them.

But I should like now and here to say a few words about those who trod after where those giants led, some in the same companies that the Brethren piloted, some in later companies following that year and the years after, some in the fateful handcarts with their unexcelled devotion, heroism, and faith, all trickling forward in a never-failing, tiny stream, till they filled the valley they entered and then flowed out at the sides and ends, peopling this whole wilderness-waste which they fructified, making it to fulfil the ancient prophecy that the desert should blossom as the rose.

I would like to say something about the last wagon in each of the long wagon trains that toiled slowly over the plains, up mountain defiles, down steep, narrow canyons, and out into the valley floor that was to be home—this last wagon: last, because the ox team that pulled it was the smallest and leanest and weakest, and had the tenderest feet of any in the train; it was slow starting, and slow moving; last, because worn and creaking, it took more time to fix and to grease, for young Jimmy generally had trouble in getting the wagon jack under the "ex"; last, because its windrent cover was old and patched and took hours to mend and tie up to keep out the storm; last, because the wife, heavy with child, must rest till the very moment of starting; last, because sickly little Bill, the last born, poorly nourished, must be washed and coaxed to eat the rough food, all they had; last, because with all his tasks—helping little Bill, cooking and cleaning up the breakfast,—Mother was not able to help much—Father took a little longer to yoke his cattle and to gird himself for the day's labor; last, because his morning prayers took a few more minutes than the others spent—he had so many blessings to thank the Lord for and some special blessings to ask the Lord to grant, blessings of health and strength, especially for his wife, and for little Bill, and for the rest, and the blessings for himself that his own courage would not fail, but most of all for the blessing of faith, faith in God and in the Brethren who sometimes seemed so far away.

But back in the last wagon, not always could they see the Brethren way out in front and the blue heaven was often shut out from their sight by heavy, dense clouds of the dust of the earth. Yet day after day, they of the last wagon pressed forward, worn and tired, footsore, sometimes almost disheartened, borne up by their faith that God loved them, that the restored gospel was true, and that the Lord led and directed the Brethren out in front.

Sometimes, they in the last wagon glimpsed, for an instant, when faith surged strongest, the glories of a celestial world, but it seemed so far away, and the vision so quickly vanished, because want and weariness and heartache and sometimes discouragement were always pressing so near. When the vision faded, their hearts sank. But they prayed again and pushed on, with little praise, with not too much encouragement, and never with adulation. But yet in that last wagon there was devotion and loyalty and integrity, and above and beyond everything else, faith in the Brethren and in God's power and goodness...." (President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., One Hundred Eighteenth Conference Report, October 1947, pp. 155 ff.; President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., To Them of the Last Wagon.)

Class Involvement Questions
1. How important to the success of that Lesson Department great westward trek were the followers, even to the last wagon?
2. How important is it that the followers today have faith in the leaders of the Church, those who "are out in front''?

President Clark states that: "These tens of thousands who so moved and so built were the warp and the woof of Brother Brigham's great commonwealth. Without them Brother Brigham had failed his mission. These were the instruments—the shovelers, the plowers, and the sowers and reapers, the machinists, the architects, the masons, the woodworkers, the organ builders, the artisans, the mathematicians, the men of letters, all gathered from the four corners of the earth, furnished by the Lord to Brother Brigham and the prophet leaders who came after, that he and they might direct the working out of His purposes " (Ibid. Page 159.)

SUMMARY
All service which advances a righteous cause is important.
President Clark said further: In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, one takes the place to which one is duly called, which place one neither seeks nor declines...(Melchizedek Priesthood Manual, 1968-69, Lesson 35, page 187.)
It is the intent of the heart, the spirit of humble acceptance, and the diligence with which one serves that are important.
"Not where you serve, but how."

INTRODUCTION TO LITERATURE
Lesson A story is told which emphasizes the devices Satan uses to turn us from righteous endeavor. It depicts envy as an insidious needle and failure as a huge club in this graphic account.
Hardly calling attention to itself, at first glance, is a plain, much-used wedge which is finally identified as the most consistently effective of all Satan's tools. This wedge is labeled discouragement.
If we smile at the obvious symbolism in this tale, we should not miss its simple point. Discouragement is the precursor of most wrongdoing. When we lose faith in ourselves and in our
72 page 689.)

efforts, it is difficult to retain faith in principles and promises which seem beyond us.
The lesson for this month attempts to help us see that the bridge between discouragement and encouragement may well be persistence.

"Say Not the Struggle Nought Availeth"
Arthur Hugh Clough's poem "Say Not the Struggle Nought Availeth" is an excellent introduction to the realities of apparent defeat:
Say not, the struggle nought availeth,
The labour and the wounds are vain,
The enemy faints not, nor faileth,
And as things have been they remain.
If hopes were dupes, fears may be hars;
It may be, in you smoke concealed,
Your comrades chase e'en now the fliers,
And, but for you, possess the field.
For while the tired waves, vainly breaking,
Seem here no painful inch to gain,
Far back, through creeks and inlets making,
Comes silent, flooding in, the main.
And not by eastern windows only,
When day light comes, comes in the light,
In front, the sun climbs slow, how slowly,
But westward, look, the land is bright.

What makes this lyric memorable is its nice balance of the ideal and the real. The battle metaphor which is developed in the first two stanzas does not degenerate into superficial heroics.
We don't meet a victor in this poem so much as a determined participant who refuses to give up. For every negative assertion he has a positive counter. If his hopes have been blasted, his fears may be no more reliable. If the waves seem to be getting no place, the tide is flooding the shore. There is no attempt in this poem to suggest that the struggle makes difficulties easier to bear.
At the conclusion, the sun is still not coming up very rapidly. But trying to find hope is in itself hope-producing. Refusal to accept defeat keeps us sensitive to every possibility of victory.
In such sensitivity we are far more prepared to succeed than we would be if we let ourselves become so dulled by opposition that we couldn't recognize a positive opportunity when it appeared.

Discussion Question
In "Say Not the Struggle Nought Availeth" a clear view of the difficulties which the author faces does not keep Lesson Department him from looking on the positive possibilities of his situation. Is there ever a danger that too detailed an anticipated view of our circumstances may compromise our efforts to improve?

'"THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS"'
Oliver Wendell Holmes' poem "The Chambered Nautilus" treats discouragement only implicitly. The focus of this beloved poem is overwhelmingly positive:

THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS
by Oliver Wendell Holmes

This is the ship of pearl, which, poets feign,
Sails the unshadowed main—
The venturous bark that flings
On the sweet summer wind its purpled wings
In gulfs enchanted, where the Siren sings.
And coral reefs lie bare,
Where the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaming hair.

Its webs of living gauze no more unfurl;
Wrecked is the ship of pearl!
And every chambered cell,
Where its dim dreaming life was wont to dwell,
As the frail tenant shaped his growing shell,
Before thee lies revealed—
Its irised ceiling rent, its sunless crypt unsealed!

Year after year beheld the silent toil
That spread his lustrous coil;
Still, as the spiral grew,
He left the past year's dwelling for the new.
Stole with soft step its shining archway through,
Built up its idle door,
Stretched in his last-found home, and knew the old no more.

Thanks for the heavenly message brought by thee, Child of the wandering sea, Cast from her lap forlorn! From thy dead lips a clearer note is born Than ever Triton blew from wreathed horn! Through the deep caves of thought I hear a voice that sings:— 73 January 1969 Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul, As the swift seasons roll! Leave thy low-vaulted past! Let each new temple, nobler than the last, Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast, Till thou at length art free, Leaving thine outgrown shell by life's unresting sea! Where Clough is more realistic, Holmes is optimistic. After developing his image for three stanzas, he gives the "heavenly message" of growth and vision which the shell of the chambered or pearly nautilus had suggested to him. The final stanza is almost pure exhortation, for Holmes' optimism is meant to be acted upon. "More stately mansions" must be built; they are not achieved without endless effort. As we live up to the opportunities we currently enjoy, we become capable of still loftier and more rewarding experiences. We cannot be satisfied with present achievement lest we make a prison out of our limited horizon. Discussion Question "The Chambered Nautilus" has occasionally been cited as a poetic expression of the Latter-day Saint concept of eternal progression. How appropriate do you feel this comparison to be? "LEARNING THE RIVER" Mark Twain's "Learning the River" lets us participate so fully in the discouragement and frustration he experienced in becoming a river pilot that we relive our own youthful disillusionments. If occasional difficult tasks proved easier in the doing than in the anticipating, others were shockingly harder 74 BS =P MUSIC COMPANY 'Singing Mothers'' ''Choir Directors'' We specialize in Mail Order Service Sheet Music Pianos And Supplies Instruments Home of the world's finest Mason and Hamlin pianos Yes!

How true to our own experience is that fact that young 'Twain's teacher pilot simply wouldn't allow him to indulge himself in discouragement. The mechanical fact that he had a watch to stand every few hours made no allowance for the way he felt. How many of us might never have learned to play a musical instrument if our parents had not been equally persistent in seeing that we persisted! Discussion Question In writing about his youth, Mark Twain did not hesitate to exaggerate or play down his actual experience in order to achieve certain effects. At what point does such an attitude toward "fact" become a problem for the reader? "TALK" BY JOHN HOLMES "Talk" demonstrates how persuasively a local, personal situation can carry overtones of general truth when it is reported in its essence. The background given in the poem is quite scanty: a young boy loitering around the shop of a man who constructs minutely detailed ship models. Since the model builder is deaf, he rarely speaks. But what young John Holmes learns—and what we learn in sharing his reminiscence—are the inviolable rules of good craftsmanship. The facts of his experience speak to him as clearly as if they had been shouted aloud. In retrospect, they were part of the "best talk" he ever encountered. Many of us can recall similar maturing experiences. Holmes is particularly successful in evoking how difficult it is for young people 75 January 1969 to understand that effort—no matter how persistent or sincere—must result in accomplishment if it is to have its full meaning. Persistence without development gives routine activity more than its due. The boy in "Talk" does learn to appreciate the necessity for careful, continuing work, but he learns a good deal more than this in his watching and listening. He finally realizes that "however you build it, / The ship must sail; you can't explain to the ocean." Such an arresting comment gives labor its fulfillment. In an age given to explanation, which is often no more than justification for failure, we recognize how often we have tried to "explain to the ocean" while we were sinking. As we develop the positive attitudes in which all skills must be based, we begin to understand that doggedness is a minor virtue until it is completed by real achievement. Habit may simply reinforce error unless it supports a worthy goal. Discussion Question Does John Holmes convince you that the silences of his youthful hours in the model builder's shop were "some of the best talk" he ever experienced? How appropriate is the word "talk" here? "THE MARCH OF ZION'S CAMP" BY S. DILWORTH YOUNG To those who have read the history of the march which is commemorated in "The March of Zion's Camp," this poem speaks with special poignance. Few commandments in early Church history seemed more capable of testing faith and commitment than the order to march to the relief of their brothers and sisters in Missouri. Although five hundred men were thus called for, only about one hundred left Kirtland in May 1834. Along the way an additional hundred joined the group. Despite warning from the Prophet against disunity, some members of the company expressed dissatisfaction with the purpose and results of the expedition, and an epidemic of cholera left more than a score dead. The incident which is the dramatic center of Elder Young's account—the miraculous deliverance at Fishing River—helped many who were in the group to understand that the Lord requires our best efforts but is not dependent upon them. The form of this poem, with its apparently casual lines, is an interesting example of the loose but real organization which characterized Zion's Camp. Line lengths may vary but none really gets out of hand. Rhythm shifts with idea as the actual cadence of informally marching men adapts itself to terrain and circumstance. Although there is a clear narrative tone to this work, there is such tension in most of the lines that they are, at least, as much exhortation as they are part of a story.

The March of Zion's Camp" seems an appropriate conclusion for our section on persistence, for it aids us in seeing that the reward of sustained effort may not be the expected one. Those who left Ohio in this determined band thought that they were going to "redeem" Zion. When the Camp was disbanded, the saints in Missouri were still undergoing trial, and there were those who felt that the whole effort was unsuccessful. In retrospect, however, those who were to assume major positions in the Church had their faith tested under fire. In addition, the Lord was preparing men through this experience for the responsibility of Discussion Question.

If "The March of Zion's Camp" was not set on the page in poetic form it would still be poetry, although it might look like prose. What would make it unmistakably poetic? 

MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS USED ON THE CULTURAL REFINEMENT RECORDING FOR OCTOBER

The October lesson in the cultural refinement course presented music using ancient instruments. It is felt that a listing of these instruments and identification of the different groups might be of interest. Identifications are by Clawson Cannon, Assistant Dean of the College of Fine Arts, Brigham Young University.

Ancient Instruments
1. Vielle—an early version of the violin, held on the arm, rather than on the shoulder.
2. Gamba—forerunner of the cello
3. Tambour—two-headed drum
4. Recorder—flute-like instrument, comes in various sizes
5. Krumhorn—reed instrument, with the mouthpiece enclosed in a capsule. It has a very deep nasal tone.

6. Baroque oboe—old-fashioned oboe

Pe Instruments Used
Group I—vielle, gamba, and tambour
Group II—baroque oboe and recorder
Group III—same as group I
Group IV—two recorders, a vielle, and a gamba
Group V—three recorders and a krumhorn

THE GENERATION GAP

Experts say love can span the generation gap. This I believe to be very true. For the sweetest words anyone of any age can hear are simply "I love you." —Pauline B. Hills

VEIL THE FUTURE

If I knew then what I know now—that death would take you in your youth—would I with my protective cry inhibit your ascent to truth? Beneath the Lord's protective bough, time was your friend. Free as the sun, you smiled your warmth on everyone. Compassionate, wise, The One above veils the future with his love. —Norma Bowkett

STORM

With staccato emphasis a storm will try to toss your dream aside To leave a dark and trembling void, the whole of phantasy torn wide— With staccato emphasis And a blinding light, startling you from slumber in the deep of night. Storms so often brashly come In the lonely dark and cold when a dream is hardest to evaluate and hold. Yet, how the gentle-fingered dawn Reaching quietly across its wake will find the dream and more beside for your empty arms to take. —Dorothy J. Roberts
