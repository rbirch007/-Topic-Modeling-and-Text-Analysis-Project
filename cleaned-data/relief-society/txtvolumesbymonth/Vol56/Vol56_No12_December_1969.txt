CHRISTMAS LULLABY  
Hush, little baby, the snow lies deep,  
Filigree-frost on the window pane.  
Hush, little baby, and sleep...  
And sleep..., Christmas has come to the world again.  
Mary cradled a little son  
And sang him to slumber that other night,  
Looked on him gently, the Holy One,  
And shepherds watched and a star burned bright.  
Mary sang in the sweet soft hay  
While camel bells tinkled upon the air,  
And even the cattle knelt, they say,  
And the little gray donkey that brought her there.  
Hush, little baby, this Christmas night,  
The snow lies deep and the wind blows white,  
And bells make music and carols ring,  
And the world is worshipful, listening.  
The fires fade and the lights grow dim,  
And Mary is singing her song to him.

I want to thank you for the wonderful Magazine, and especially for the July and August issues. It has been some months since we had a Magazine since coming to the Canal Zone, and then we received two in one day. The poems in them by Hazel Loomis were especially dear to me because she is my cousin, and we have not seen each other in such a long time. I feel as if we have had a good visit ("By Handcart Came" July Frontispiece; "Patch Quilt," August 1969, page 589). The gospel is here, and the sisters are especially good to us.  
Ora M. Welch, Pacific Branch, Canal Zone  

Today my August Magazine came—but so did two little children to play with my own daughter while their mothers helped with our ward project. Three children between one and two years of age keep me hopping. Somehow I was able to fit the three completely different schedules into one—and now they are all napping.  
Picked up the Magazine, and the editorial "Leisure for Oneself," by Marianne C. Sharp, really hit the spot—a couple of hours of leisure time, well deserved and much needed. Thanks for all that The Relief Society Magazine stands for.  
Kenon King, Van Nuys, California  

Thanks so much for the wonderful Magazine. It helped me through many a lonely time when I was single. It contains beautiful stories that can uplift the soul of a lonely soldier far from home. Thanks again for the wonderful sisters of Relief Society.  
Sgt. Brent Boehme, Denver, Colorado  

I would like to thank my Aunt Millie Halladay and her family for sending me the lovely Relief Society Magazine. She recently passed away and is greatly missed by all who knew her, but the Magazine she left us is precious. It is the only link we have with our beloved Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We live too far away to attend any ward or branch. I love the dear poems of Bertha A. Kleinman whom I had the privilege of meeting in person in my home town—Mesa, Arizona. We appreciate the Magazine so much that we study it from cover to cover.  
Clella Roseberry Lewis, Fruitvale, Texas  

I am thankful that I have been a member of the Relief Society for fifty-one years. I used to read the Magazine before I married. When I married in January 1918, my husband's mother was the president of the Heyburn, Idaho, Ward Relief Society. We subscribed for the Magazine so that I could enjoy its teachings. We were blessed with eleven children, seven of whom are still living. I am thankful for the poems and lessons and the beautiful message of the gospel truths published in the Magazine.  
Olive Christensen Warner, Declo, Idaho  

The Magazine is a magnificent testimony builder—and I am now referring to the marvelous lessons that have been prepared for us all. I have been very fortunate to have been a spiritual living class leader for eight years, so I am familiar with these lessons.  
Marilyn Hershberger, Soldatna, Alaska  

I was so happy to receive the September Magazine. My health prevents me from attending Relief Society meetings as I would like to do, and so the Magazine has become "my home Relief Society." My daughters are three and one and a half. One of my most pleasant times is when three-year-old hops on the bed so that I can read the Magazine to her. We talk about the pictures and the stories and sometimes share the poems. I especially enjoyed the lovely color section in the September Magazine.

ERM President Hugh B. Brown Of the First Presidency [Address delivered at the General Session of Relief Society Annual General Conference, October 1, 1969.] @ My dear sisters of the Relief Society of the Church, it is an honor and a privilege to be asked to participate in the programs of this general conference. It is hoped that we may define and delineate some of the distinguishing characteristics of this great organization whose motto, as you have heard, is charity, and, may I add, whose slogan is service.

President David O. McKay would be here if he could. I am sure if he could have been given the choice of which session of the general conference he would attend, if he could only attend one, he would choose to attend this session. His spirit is with you, his heart is with you, and he sends his love and his greetings.

Religion has too often spent a large proportion of its effort on doings apart from the real business of life. One of life's problems is to establish a deep understanding of man's relationship to his fellow men. When that relationship is faulty, men are not living in the just, helpful, and cooperative fellowship which the Savior enjoined. On every hand we see an appalling human need awaiting the harness of religious power and zeal. One of mankind's most insistent needs is the interpretation of religion in terms of service.

Let us go back for instruction to the Hebrew Prophet Micah: Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself before the high God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?

He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? (Micah 6:6-8.)

Man's curious ability to keep divine relationships in one compartment of life and human relationships in another is wrong. They belong together. And in the Relief Society they are together. For the Relief Society knows no division of our obligations to God and to his children.

Too much of religion's driving power remains unharnessed to the needs that he all about us. The Prophet Isaiah spoke directly to this subject when he said, Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil; Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed.... (Isaiah 1:16-17.)

Fortunately, in the lives of many people, piety really does involve goodness, and faith involves justice, and worship, humaneness, and their life with God has a definite connection with their daily relationships. It makes them better home folk, better friends, neighbors, and citizens.

The prayer of Charles Kingsley could well become a part of our daily worship. He said, "Guide me, teach me, strengthen me till I become such a person as thou wouldst have me be, pure and gentle, trustful and rightminded, brave and able, courteous and generous, dutiful and useful." That sounds to me like a Relief Society prayer.

Religious life should inspire practical goodness and daily usefulness. God dwells in the hearts of the human family as well as in temples. The Lord said through the Prophet Hosea, "... I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings." (Hosea 6:6.)

Service

The Savior, while he lived among men, in order to emphasize the meaning of service, ate with the ceremonially unclean, transgressed the law of the Sabbath in the interest of human helpfulness, and gave his life as a service to mankind. Jesus emphasized the truth that God is not primarily in the Church, but in the midst of the needy, sinning, failing yet aspiring humanity.

Paraphrasing Henry Ward Beecher, religion means work. The battle of religion, like all other battles, means peril, blows given, but blows taken as well. Religion means transformation.

Dr. Wilford Grenfell, the Lincoln of Labrador, with whom I was briefly associated during the First World War, made the statement, "Whether we, our neighbor, or God is the judge, absolutely the only value of our religious life to ourselves or to anyone else is what it fits us for, and enables and inspires us to do."

Every man's religion should have practical issue, not merely emotional responsiveness which delights in hearing the gospel, but lacks diligence in living it. We must remember that religion is action, not diction.

Let us pray that God will deliver us from our dullness of conscience, from a feeble sense of duty, from thoughtless disregard of others, and from all half-heartedness in our work.

The Hebrew prophets had a supreme abhorrence of what they called "unmoral" religion, and the Master shared their conviction. He pilloried the Pharisees in everlasting scorn. Their pettiness, their quibbling, their false emphasis, their bigotry, and the uncharitableness of their lives, their lack of forthright honesty, aroused his indignation. Their religion made them worse, not better.

To the Master, religion meant graciousness and magnanimity, self-forgetfulness and self-denial, high purpose and deep joy in the ministry, boundless brotherhood and love blocked by no ingratitude or sin. There was inexhaustible goodwill in all of his teachings, and he emphasized over and over again the need and blessing of service—outgoing service to all those whose lives we touch.

No one can doubt the central place which service held in the life of the Savior, as it is referred to in the parable of the Good Samaritan or in that other solemn utterance where the standing of the dead before the throne of God depended upon whether they had fed the hungry, clothed the naked, given drink to the thirsty, and visited the imprisoned and the sick. He said of himself, "... The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many." (Matthew 20:28.)

He that is greatest among you should not call himself a disciple of the Master until he possesses the spirit and knows the meaning of service.

An aged and industrious Relief Society worker once said, "There's a lot of room in heaven, but there's no place to sit down!"

Today we are confronted with many social evils—we have war, poverty, disease, ignorance, vice—all of which have become commonplace in the modern world. One-third of the population of the globe, nominally Christian, has seemingly failed to realize the full meaning of Christianity. Religion must not become an isolated and uninfluential afterthought.

On Sundays, when the banks and stores are closed and the rest of life is still, when the finer forces stir within us, we go in company with our family and friends to the Church for formal worship. This is good.

But when it is over, we too often close the door on that experience and return to the routine and mundane affairs of life. The Relief Society, and all the members thereof, are, or should be, willingly harnessed to the task of serving their fellow men. And this is a continuing obligation and a continuing benediction. Strictly speaking, our worshiping assemblies on the Sabbath day should not be called "church service" for church _ service should begin on Monday morning and last all through the week. Church service is helpfulness to people. Public worship is but preparation for that helpfulness. Ours should be a life of ministry amidst the dust and din of daily business.

The Hebrew prophets directed their scorn against the religious trivialities of their day, and the Savior scorned the quibbling minds that tithed mint, anise, and cummin, yet neglected the weightier matters of the law. With the experience of two world wars behind us, and now the hapless war on foreign soil, thoughtful men are coming to realize that some things which were once deemed important are really of small account. We must somehow get rid of our ante-bellum concepts and address ourselves to the stupendous task of making over the shattered world preparatory to the millennium, when the battered and broken lives of the unfortunate and the sinful can be reclaimed; when our social life, its business, its statecraft, its international relationships can be transformed by the renewing of men.

With so much work to be done, so much action on many fronts, we cannot afford to ride theological hobbies or be obsessed with favorite fashions in religious phylacteries, else we shall miss the main issue of the gospel. He who travels widely and observes carefully is impressed by the spiritual desolation of millions of men who live near expensive churches but are impressed and disillusioned by the frivolous futility of much that is called religion. It becomes, in fact, a ghastly mockery.

When we think of the One who came to seek and to save those who were lost, and when we observe the apathy or, at best, the fitful interest in other than outward appearance, when we become concerned only with our meetinghouses, our tabernacles, and temples, let us look about us and see the millions who are not affected thereby. We should resolve to reach out our hands and save them from the inferno toward which they are moving, and we should concentrate all our energies on the united effort to rescue some, at least, of them whom Christ came to save.

Too many men accept religion, profess to love it, and cleave unto it, not from many unselfish motives but solely because of an inward peace, a quieted conscience, and the radiant hope which they themselves get from it. Religion then becomes not a stimulus but a sedative. It is used not as an inspiration to service, but as a substitute for service. We too often have mystical experiences of the spiritual, and a peaceful sense of being pardoned by God and reconciled with him, as we purr and primp in the shade of public praise. Religion reaches such men only on their receptive side. They are yielding to the lure of selfishness.

The Master and his disciples referred often to the tendency among their followers to become hearers of the word rather than doers. The Savior said, "And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand...." (Matthew 7:26.) And Paul wrote that not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law.

While we live, we should try to make each day a year so far as beauty, nobility, and a warm sense of brotherhood are concerned. In a time when there is so much cruelty abroad, we must generate the oxygen of love to keep the soul of the world still breathing. Religion should summon all of us to deepen the quality of life as compensation for diminution of its quantity, to treasure each other in the recognition that we do not know how long we shall have each other, to make life strong and brave and beautiful is our answer to the inexorable approach of the forces of death.

We must make up for the threatened brevity of life by heightening the intensity of life. Our very understanding of each other can serve to deepen life even when we cannot lengthen it. The mission of the Relief Society, and it is discharging this obligation admirably, is to establish in the hearts of men and women a love that involves unselfishness, willing sacrifice, mutual forbearance, absolute fidelity, boundless devotion.

There is a drawing power in love. You can feel it just as surely as you can feel heat or cold. "I will draw all men unto me," said Jesus. Whenever you come into the presence of a loving heart, if you are in tune, you will feel the heavenly power and will be drawn by the magnetism of love. Service is included in, and is a product of love. So long as we love, we serve.

"Not what we give but what we share, for the gift without the giver is bare," said Sir Launfal. And James Russell Lowell said, "All the beautiful sentiments in the world weigh less than a single lovely action." And from Sir Walter Scott, "It is greater to do a kind deed than to write a novel."

Let this ever be our prayer as we labor in Relief Society: "Help us, O Lord, to find those who need us." Too many are comfortable in the luxury of their self-approval as they listen with receptiveness to the consolations which come from those who hear the gospel message. Let everyone get under the load of responsibility, and realize that every doctrine has its associated duty, that every truth has its task.

The gospel when the Master first proclaimed it was not intended primarily for preaching—it was intended for action. Surely there is a challenge to all Christians who look about them and see the appalling sin, the haggard want, the infuriating oppression which befall millions of our fellow men—for every one of whom the Savior died.

Lord, we cannot serve thee as did Martha in those days,
But we can seek and find thee in a thousand other ways.
The poor, the hungry, and the weary cry out ceaselessly,
And every home, if filled with love, can be a Bethany.

The inevitable expression of real Christianity is a life of sacrificial service. No man can truly assimilate Christianity by impression alone; there must be expression as well.

But back came to me the stranger—his lamp was glowing fine; He held the precious flame and lighted mine.

I want to congratulate the President and her Counselors on their magnificent addresses this afternoon and I am humble in being asked to follow them. Surely we have no greater preachers of the gospel than you members of the Relief Society. We want you to know that we love, admire, support and depend upon you for the work of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It seems to me that the Relief Society is really the backbone of the Church. For that I humbly thank God, and being a married man, I know what it is to have the woman standing beside you, upholding and defending you and encouraging you when you are up against real problems.

May all of us be inspired to seize the torch and hold it high, remembering that we may from one candle light a thousand others without diminishing our own. May our lives be given to charity and service and thus may service become real servants of the Master. Thank you for permitting me to participate briefly, and may God's choicest blessings be with your General Presidency, the General Board, with your stake and ward, mission, branch officers and teachers, and with all the members of the Relief Society throughout the world.

O God, bless and sanctify the efforts of our sisters upon whom we depend so completely for their help and for their inspiration. We thank you so very much and pray God's blessing upon you in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

INVENTORY: A SNOWBALL TREE

Soon the year will end and I shall take
An inventory of all blessings sent
My way.
For future scantier years I'll make
A special note of how the snowball bent
Its thick-leafed branches toward my kitchen sink;
How leaf-green newness turned to blossomed snow
And lush cool shade, and lingered then, I think,
Long past the scheduled time for leaves to go,
Lingered while the sun poured red and rust
And amber gold through once-green leaf-veins.
Day after day I gloried in them, thinking they must
Fall soon. For all things earthy go the way
Of transient growth and bloom and then to dust.
Only the memories of their beauty stay;
Today my snowball tree, etched in frost,
Adds to this blessing and will not be lost.

Elder Marvin J. Ashton, former first assistant in the YMMIA general superintendency was sustained as an Assistant to the Council of the Twelve at the Friday afternoon session of the 139th Semi-Annual General Conference of the Church. Prior to his appointment, Elder Ashton had served eleven years in the YMMIA general superintendency and ten years on the general board of that organization. While in the superintendency he gave supervision to the MIA activities in music, dance, drama, speech, and athletics. He had much influence in developing the Church athletic program into what it is today. He also has served as senior president of the 315th Quorum of Seventy.

Only a week prior to his appointment as a General Authority, Elder Ashton had been appointed managing director of the Unified Social Services Committee, a new committee to function under direction of the Church Priesthood Correlation Committee. This committee will include the principal youth and child services of the Church: the Youth Guidance Program, the Relief Society Social Services, and the Indian Student Placement Program.

Elder Ashton was born in Salt Lake City, May 6, 1915, a son of Marvin O. And Rae J. Ashton. He attended Salt Lake City schools and was graduated from the University of Utah with a degree in business administration. Elder Ashton helped establish his reputation as a crusader for youth when, as a Utah State Senator from 1957-1961, he spearheaded legislation for improvement of statewide juvenile detention facilities. He serves on various committees for the betterment of youth, and has given long service to the Boy Scouts of America. He holds the organization's highest awards, and serves on a national committee.

Elder Ashton served a mission to England, and has traveled world-wide as a speaker, directing most of his efforts toward the youth. In 1940 he was married to Norma Berntson in the Salt Lake Temple. They are the parents of four children: John, Jonne Ashton Wheadon, Stephen, and Janice. Sister Ashton is a member of the General Board of Relief Society.

SOFT WHITE SNOW AND EVERGREENS
PHOTO BY ERIC M. SANFORD

A SNOWY MORNING

The snow sneaked in on us last night
On downy, padded feet.
So still it is as flakes float down
All muffled in the street.
The cars creep past like shrouded ghosts.
No children shout aloud.
The sky above is quiet, too;
One massive, great gray cloud.

How peaceful and serene earth lies
Under its coverlet of white.
That softly, silently drifted down
During the tranquil night.

The Relief Society Annual General Conference 1969

Mayola R. Miltenberger
General Secretary-Treasurer

@ "The fields of compassion have not all been plowed," said Elder Bruce R. McConkie as he addressed the opening session of the 1969 Annual General Conference of the Relief Society held October 1 and 2 in Salt Lake City. A colorful assembly of Relief Society women from various parts of the world heard revered priesthood and Relief Society leaders in numerous sessions give words of comfort and faith, of admonition and instruction to the Society.

"Religion must not become an isolated and uninfluential afterthought," but its "driving power must be harnessed" in order that the "needs of today be met." So

This group of Lamanite Singing Mothers performed in the Presidencies Department of the Annual Relief Society General Conference, October 2, 1969. Their singing was under the arrangement of Margaret E. Dahl, Supervisor, Northern Indian Mission Relief Society.

Spoke President Hugh B. Brown in the General Session of the conference. President Joseph Fielding Smith, Elder Mark E. Petersen, and Elder Marion G. Romney gave inspiring addresses urging women to use their powers (as women) to better the world, to strengthen their homes, to encourage their husbands; to place their confidence in the priesthood, to teach their sons to understand and honor their priesthood, and to "save souls" as they were originally instructed to do by the Prophet Joseph Smith.

The messages of the priesthood leaders and those of the Relief Society General Presidency and other participants of the conference together with the moving, and at times, ethereal music rendered by Singing Mothers choruses combined to make this conference, according to many, the "best ever."

New emphasis was given to excellence in music by the rendition of an hour-long choral presentation together with a narration during the Stake Board session in the Tabernacle. The combined Singing Mothers choruses of the Cottonwood, Mill Creek, Murray, and Wilford Regions, under the brilliant musicianship of Sister Ellen N. Barnes of the General Board, provided the conference with a new dimension in this phase of Relief Society work. The chorus was accompanied by Roy M. Darley, a Tabernacle organist.

The galaxy of nine departmental meetings held simultaneously produced ideas designed to assist in the various facets of Relief Society work. These meetings sparkled with exciting homemaking displays, original dramatizations set to specially composed music, with cogent addresses, visual aids, and demonstrations. The Official Instructions issued by President Belle S. Spafford, who presided at all major sessions, were given as guidelines for the governing of the world Society. President Spafford also challenged the women by her stirring address, "If It Is Right, We Can Do It." She said, "The task before us is great but it is not beyond our successful accomplishment." In her address Counselor Marianne C. Sharp reminded the women that "Charity Never Faileth," and Counselor Louise W. Madsen spoke of the "Spiritual Values of Homemaking."

Against beautiful settings in the Relief Society Building and Parley's Stake Center, women gathered the evening of October 1st personally to meet the Relief Society Presidency and members of the General Board. There they partook of refreshments and exchanged greetings during the annual reception honoring the visiting sisters.

The unifying of womankind into a world sisterhood—a goal of Relief Society—was particularly underscored by the attendance of a large group of Lamanite Relief Society sisters from the Northern Indian Mission. Sisters from cities with different sounding names such as Pago Pago and Sao Paulo mingled with those from Anaheim, Idaho Falls, Snowflake, Kansas City, and Kalamazoo. Surnames like Red Wolf, Jack Rabbit, Fadmausili, Gonzales, and Jones, smiled, embraced, and communed as "sisters" do.

When the conference closed at 4 p.m. Thursday, October 2nd, there seemed to be an eagerness to apply what had been seen and heard. The sisters returned to their homes with the words of President Hugh B. Brown ringing in their ears: "... The mission of Relief Society is to establish in the hearts of... Women a love that involves unselfishness, willing sacrifice, mutual forbearance, absolute fidelity, and dauntless devotion."

893

The howling wind made the tall old house rock and creak. It came down the chimney blowing puffs of smoke into the room from the big pot-bellied stove. The windows were rattling, and Mama was stuffing rags into the cracks to hold back the snow. I ran to her and held onto her skirt. Sternly she told me to let go so she could move around. She stopped for a minute, scraped frost from the glass pane, looked out, then started to cry.

Mama cried a lot these cold winter days. Papa said she was just homesick, but I knew better, for I heard them talking after they put me to bed. "There's no use in staying in this God-forsaken place," Mama said, "now that you have sold the cattle, we can go back to Southern Utah, and live like other people!" "I am not leaving the land I took in as part payment on the cattle," Papa said, "besides Canada is a coming country, already the land is fast being taken by homesteaders."

894

" Lila L. Sau

I did not know what a God-forsaken place was, or what homesteaders were, but I thought it must have something to do with all the snow and ice piling up outside, and something terrible would happen to us as it did to the people in the Bible, when God did not like them. It was dark when Papa and the boys came in, stomping the snow from their boots and clothes. Mama lit the lamp, and started supper.

"Is it time to put the nails in the wall for the stockings?" I asked Mama. "Yes, get your brothers to put them in behind the kitchen stove, so the things Santa puts in them won't freeze," Mama said looking at Papa. "Do you think Santa Claus can get through the deep snow?" I whispered to my big brother. "Sure," he said, "Mr. Taylor at the post office says he always gets through. Sometimes the mailman brings things for him."

I ran to get the stockings and started hanging them on the nails, but as I reached far over to the last nail my hand slipped and I touched the back of the hot stove. I let out a scream. Papa picked me up, and started soothing me. Mama did not say a word. She just reached for the Magic Bag from the top of the cupboard, took me from Papa, put salve that smelled of camphor on my burned arm, and wrapped a clean white cloth around it. She dried my eyes, kissed my cheek, and put me in the big rocker.

"You'll be all right now," she said with a smile. "Just think about it being Christmas Eve, and Santa coming." Somehow it did not hurt any longer, and I almost fell asleep as I smelled the loaves of brown bread Mama was taking from the oven, and watched her dish up hot stew for our supper.

The house did not creak anymore, and after supper my brothers rubbed the frost off the window so we could see the deep snow glistening in the moonlight. Papa said the storm was over, and Mama said, "After three days it is about time or we will all be buried alive!" We had just settled down to story reading when the knock came at the door. Papa opened it, and a big man in a fur coat and hat came in. He was covered with snow, and icicles hung from his eyebrows and mustache.

"I am Mr. Armstrong," he said, "my wife needs help, and I can't get through those drifts to Kimball to get Mrs. Talbot in time. I heard that your wife has had training with the sick, Mama and the Magic Bag so I came to ask her to help us." Mr. Armstrong was all out of breath when he had finished. Papa tried to take his coat and hat, but he said, "No, there is not time, I must get back."

Mama took down the Magic Bag, opened it to check the medicine inside, then I followed her into the bedroom and watched while she combed her long black hair. She whirled it round and round, then pinned it in a big bob on top of her head. She put on a clean white apron and let me kneel beside her while she said her prayers. Papa helped her into his big fur coat, he put Lorin's overshoes on her feet. She put a wool fascinator scarf around her head, then followed Mr. Armstrong into the cold frosty night.

I cried myself to sleep when Papa put me to bed. It was sad not to have Mama home when Santa Claus was coming. The room was still dark when I woke up and saw the light shining through the curtain over the doorway. I jumped out of bed and ran into the big room that was kitchen, boys' bedroom, and living room for our family. A blast of cold air came in the door with Mama and Mr. Armstrong. They were both covered with snow.



Mama said the horse could not pull them and the buggy through the deep drifts and they had to get out and walk. She looked tired and pale. Papa helped her off with the big coat. In my excitement at seeing Mama I had forgotten about Santa and the stockings. Then the boys jumped out of bed, and we went to look behind the stove. Santa had got through. The boys 895 December 1969 had skates, and standing beneath my stocking was a pretty Red Riding doll. But I lost interest in the doll when I heard Mr. Armstrong say that Mama had given them a beautiful baby boy for Christmas! The rest of the day I played with my doll, but kept looking at the Magic Bag on top of the cupboard in hopes another Christmas baby would come out. We ate our dinner of roast beef, mashed potatoes, and creamed carrots, topped off with Mama's suet pudding and sauce, which we could hardly choke down after Mama told us there would be no Christmas dinner at the Armstrongs, just potatoes, cabbage, and an egg if the hens laid enough. The early snow and freezing had covered their crop before it could be cut and threshed. After the boys had washed the dishes for Mama, Papa brought around the horses and sleigh to take Mama to see how Mrs. Armstrong and the baby were getting along, and we all went with them. The horses lunged through the deep snow, sending snowballs from their hoofs back into the sleigh. We laughed when the drifts were so high the sleigh bounced over the top, jarring us when it hit bottom. We arrived at the Armstrong house that looked like two boxes put together with a lean-to porch in between. Papa tied the horses and we followed Mama into one of the boxes. I looked at the other door, and just knew it must be the stable. The side we went in was a kitchen where four children sat with their coats on, huddled around the stove. "You better keep your coats on," the oldest boy said, "there's not enough wood to keep both stoves going, and Mama and the baby must be kept warm. Papa has gone over to an old shed to find more wood." Mama told me to take off my hood and mittens. But when I pulled off my mittens out came the two red apples I had carried clenched in my fists and they rolled on the floor. I was afraid Mama would scold— but she just smiled as I picked them up and gave them to the two little girls. Mama took the kettle from the stove and the Magic Bag and left for the stable. I helped the two girls cut out paper dolls from a catalog, and my two brothers played marbles with the two Armstrong boys. Papa came in carrying a big box. He took out Mama's big roaster and put it in the oven, then piled wood in the stove and a few chunks of coal. Soon Mama came to the door and told us we could come see the baby. When we went through the other door it wasn't a stable, but a big bedroom. The baby was in a cradle made of a wooden box, not a manger. He had a red face, but no halo on his head as it shows the Christmas Baby in the Bible stories! Then we left for home and the setting sun made the white world and clouds look pink. Mama said, "This has been a beautiful Christmas day." And we sang "Jingle Bells" to the sound of the squeaking sleigh runners cutting the crisp snow. When we arrived home Mama and I took off our wraps, my brother Ray brought in the coal, and Papa built up a warm fire. "What's for supper, Mama?" Lorin asked. "Oh, we can make sandwiches from the roast beef left from dinner," she said. "I don't think we can," Papa said, "I took it and the gravy to the Armstrongs. But we can have the rest of the suet pudding and sauce." Mama and the Magic Bag "No, we can't," Mama said, "I took that to Mrs. Armstrong." "Well, boys, let's have some of the nuts and candy from your stockings," Papa said, "because it won't matter if they do spoil our appetites now." "We can't give you any from our stockings, Papa, we took them to the Armstrong children," Ray said. Everyone laughed, and we made jokes and riddles while we ate our supper of bread and milk. From then on if anything was lost, we would ask, "Did you take it to the Armstrongs?" Mama never cried by the window any longer, she was too busy making carbolic salve, camphorated oil, liniment, and canker medicine from the recipes Grandpa Pugh had brought across the plains with him in the Magic Black Bag. They had been given to him by his Welsh ancestors, and given to Mama when she left for Canada. Mama always said she found a magic recipe for happiness in the Magic Bag that Christmas Eve, and she often told it to us: A lot of faith, with a lot of work will make everything turn out right. And never feel sorry for yourself—there is always someone in the world with more miseries than your own. All winter she went through blizzards, rain, winds, and floods to help children with croup, pneumonia, and broken bones. She left babies for ranch women, women on lonely homesteads, and women across the boundary line on the Indian reservation. Through it all she had a smile, time to tell us stories, and time to sing.

The 139th Semi-Annual Conference of the Church was held in the Tabernacle in Salt Lake City, Utah, the 3d, 4th, and 5th of October 1969, in a time of harvest in the mountain valleys, and in a spirit of gratitude and rejoicing for the everlasting gospel. By ships of the sea and by planes of the air, by train, by bus, and in private cars, the saints journeyed to the place of gathering. Many walked from nearby homes, and all who attended the meetings heard the words of salvation, authentic and inspiring as in other times and other places since the glorious restoration and organization of the Church in these latter days. From many lands and many nations, from the continents and the islands of the sea came the members of the Church to be comforted, renewed, blessed, and directed. The Tabernacle was filled to overflowing and other thousands heard the addresses and the uplifting music in the Assembly Hall and in the Salt Palace nearby. Foreign visitors were privileged to hear the proceedings by direct translation. By radio and television, other thousands in many parts of the world participated in a renewed dedication of their lives to spiritual ideals and a devotion to service and brotherhood in their daily lives.

In addition to the Tabernacle Choir, three other choruses sang during the meetings: The Brigham Young University Combined Chorus, the Singing Mothers from Cottonwood, Mill Creek, Murray, and Wilford regions; and the MIA Girls Centennial Chorus. President David O. McKay, from his nearby home, presided at all the conference sessions, and the meetings were conducted by President Hugh B. Brown, President Nathan Eldon Tanner, President Joseph Fielding Smith, and President Alvin R. Dyer of the First Presidency. President Thorpe B. Isaacson was in his place during the conference.

Elder Marvin J. Ashton, former First Assistant YMMIA Superintendent, was sustained as an Assistant to the Council of the Twelve. Words of appreciation and abiding love for Elder John Longden, an Assistant to the Council of the Twelve, who passed away in August, were expressed by General Authorities and by many others who missed the presence of a beloved leader and inspired counselor.

In his opening address, delivered by his son Robert R. McKay, President David O. McKay spoke of the astronauts and their journey into the realms of outer space, saying "Members of the Church have always known through revelation of the numberless creations of God." Although God has created the universe and all therein, "man is the jewel of God." This is just another way of saying that the earth was created for man and not man for the earth. God gave to man part of his divinity. He gave man the power of choice, and no other creature in the world has it. So he placed upon the individual the obligation of conducting himself as an eternal being.

You cannot think of any greater gift that could come to a man or woman than the freedom of choice. You alone are responsible, and by wielding and exercising that freedom of choice, you grow in character, you grow in intelligence, you approach divinity, and eventually may achieve that high exaltation. That is a great obligation. Very few people appreciate it.

The roads are clearly marked—one offering animal existence, the other life abundant. In his closing address, read by his son Robert, President McKay expressed his love for the saints in all the world, admonishing them to righteousness, and testifying of his own great faith: "I wish to emphasize the fact that this great conference has testified to the hundreds of thousands listening in from all over the world that God lives, and furthermore that Jesus is His Beloved Son, the Savior of the world. We have also testified to the world that man is not living for himself, that his selfish desires should be overcome and controlled, and that he should render service to others." I am grateful for and pray that God will continue to direct and bless our General Authorities who have inspired us with their messages during the sessions of this great conference.

Singing Mothers of Los Angeles Area to Present Christmas Program Over National Broadcasting Corporation Radio

On Monday evening, December 22, 1969 at 7:05 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, the Singing Mothers of the Los Angeles area will present the half hour "Voices of Christmas," program sponsored by the National Broadcasting Company.

Ellen N. Barnes of the General Board of Relief Society will conduct the Singing Mothers from Los Angeles, South Los Angeles, Santa Monica, Inglewood, and Huntington Park Stakes, assisted by Renee Sheranian Goates, harpist, and Melva Niles Barborka and Linda Hallett soprano soloists, with Jacqueline Young as accompanist. Eight Christmas songs will be presented, including "Silent Night," "It Came Upon a Midnight Clear," and "O Holy Night."

Relief Society women throughout the Church, and thousands of other listeners who have radio broadcasting available through NBC or its affiliates, will thus have an opportunity to hear representative Singing Mothers offering "The Voices of Christmas" over a wide network at a time of special remembrance and observance of a sacred season.

Mrs. Shirley Temple Black, former famous and beloved child actress of moving pictures, has been appointed one of the ten United States delegates to the United Nations General Assembly.

Mrs. Antoinette Concello has been a circus performer since 1929 when she joined a flying trapeze act. She retired for a time when her son was young, but now that he is in law school, she has reinvested her valuable experience to further the future of the circus and now serves Barnum and Bailey Circus as director of the aerial ballet.

Women Pilots in the United States number seventy who hold air transport ratings from the Federal Aviation Administration.

Approximately another 1700 hold commercial licenses, while an additional 500 are licensed flight instructors. The airlines do not hire women as air transport pilots. Mrs. Roxa Wright, Woman's Day needlework editor and herself a needlework designer, collected for the New York Hallmark Gallery's spring exhibit of America's needlework: past and present, many rare and breath-takingly beautiful items. Some, lent by museums and historical collections date from early eighteenth century. Embroidery, appliqué, elaborate petit-point, crochet, all kinds of handwork embellished utilitarian objects, and clothes demonstrate touchingly the skills of many countries and a depth and breadth of aesthetic feelings. Mrs. Lois Arnow and Mrs. Mary B. Kadesch are "plant librarians" at the University of Utah Herbarium, a plant reference library. The library furnishes information on many species of plants, identifies poisonous plants, edible and non-edible plants, and supplies data for medical research, as well as aiding air pollution experts and police officers and others in the identification of narcotic specimens.

Cutting the bright red ribbon to tie the holly paper covered box holding Christmas tree shaped cookies, my friend remarked to me: "It used to be that Christmas was a day. Now, Christmas is a season." We reflected together on these words as we continued wrapping gifts for a committee to take to anumber of senior citizens in our area. As I reached for the box of silver stars to fasten the foil paper, I remembered back to the silver star on top of the community Christmas tree when I was small. How eagerly we anticipated the surprises of that wonderful day of Christmas, living fully for one joyous day, remembering it for a whole year. In that moment of remembrance, I was glad that Christmas has been extended into an abundantly full season. How rich in friendship and fellowship and sharing is all the year because of active participation in a season of Christmas.

Trading of news and recipes is part of the Christmas season. One of the richest gifts I ever received for my kitchen came from a friend who lives in a convalescent home for the aged. She took time to copy from her re-tired missionary friends, who lived there, the various recipes from countries where they had served.

Just a step away from comparing recipes to the art of learning how to decorate differently for the Christmas season. Greenery and shrubbery which seem so familiar they are almost prosaic take on new luster when sprayed with gold or silver paint. Men who have never made an artistic design in their lives find it an absorbing hobby to see what they can do with the humble tumbleweed to turn it into a miniature Christmas tree.

Closely allied to this discovery of new talents in decorating is that of learning to express tastes through gift wrapping of packages. None of us can excel at everything, and if we decide we do not like to make fancy bows, we can learn to tie with red string or yarn, while the season of Christmas gives us a chance to try out our skills.

This is an opportunity for husband and wife to learn to work together in new ways, perhaps in painting a little red wagon, or enameling tins to hold cookies. Making things by hand helps to restore some of the joy of simplicity in Christmas planning, and one of the new ways in which this is expressed is through use of photography.

Pictures enable a family to make a gift showing their most precious possessions, their children. How eagerly we open the cards which seem destined to contain pictures of children and grandchildren. These seem to arrive in the mail earlier every year, a part of the trend of making a season of Christmas. This fellowship by mail is a good supplement to the companionship in person as evidenced by invitations to an open house.

Certain good friends in our community I do not see socially more than at Christmastime when their homes are opened to many friends. Yet the whole Christmas season is blessed when their invitations arrive for sharing "at home" courtesies. We enjoy their sandwiches and cookies, and may see the first candy canes of the season hanging from the limbs of the refreshment table tree.

One of the things we talk about during the social hour is the Christmas music to be presented soon. We discuss the annual Christmas festival of music held at the nearby university, and to which friends from out of town always make a pilgrimage, and where we have a chance to say "hello."

Not to be forgotten are the great gifts of Christmas music and drama offered by radio and television, for the Christmas season is universal in its appeal, cutting across boundaries of race and economic situation.

With all of these shared attractions, it is time to plan for the Season of Christmas. Christmas dinner and the day itself, within the walls of the home. Places are set for loved ones and perhaps a friend who would be lonely without this special invitation. The new doll is rocked, and the bicycle taken for its first ride, in homes where there are children. Older members open a book, but it may not be read fully because of happy memories which intrude.

Voices of the carolers who stopped by to sing in this block echo in my heart, interrupted by the paper carrier at the door who wants to say "thank you" for his new pencil set. Perhaps there is time to take all the family in the automobile out beneath the stars to see the specially decorated Christmas trees nearby.

Maybe there is an annual contest for the best outdoor decorations, and spotlights will be focused on a painted manger scene beneath a picture window. But all the houses seem to be specially decorated, each in its own way, significant tributes to the birthday of a King.

I think also of the homes far away from which messages of love and affection have come through the mail, and visualize the lights in their windows across mountains and oceans. The lights will not go out at the end of Christmas night. For it is the custom to extend decorations through to the coming of the New Year, and perhaps to Twelfth Night, as was done in earlier centuries.

In my heart is the light of hope and fellowship generated by this season of Christmas, and silently I say a prayer that its beauty may remain with me through all the routine busy days of the year ahead.

903 Petunias Fly High

Helen Hinckley Jones

Whenever I go to bed, usually tired or feeling locked behind high fences, my reach. This dream often of one I don't need to ask a psychologist what the dream means. It first started to portray against fences when out with my mother's parents in Provo, Utah. When Vera and Be off together, leaving me to suffer the pangs of being across the front of Grandfather's house and garden see as the stockades that protected settlers from the Indians.

I must ha stood why I was left behind. What use grown-up nine and t have for a six-year-old tag-along? Ye That is the way I remember that Proveswisit. V Bob never got on their way without hearing Mother's swe for Helen." Anyway, I still have this dream and I rouse myself to think of my Grandfather Cheever and the day we talked about petunias. Grandfather had an amazing garden, but the flowers in it were not for picking. Children could look at the blossoms, smell them, enjoy them, but never pick them. No one ever took the trouble to explain to us children that Grandfather was a nurseryman and that the beautiful flowers yielded seeds only when they were left on the vine, so we thought Grandfather liked flowers more than people and that he was perhaps just a little bit selfish.

One day, Grandfather found me shaking the gate with all my strength and crying. He gave me a grayish peppermint from his pocket and invited me to walk with him in the garden. This was an unusual invitation. Grandfather was very old, at least he seemed so to me. When I heard the Bible stories about Noah and Methuselah, I always thought of Grandfather. I knew that he had been older than was usual on the frontier when he married my grandmother and Mother was their tenth child. I thought he didn't like children, but perhaps that was wrong because once before when I had been left behind, he had asked me if I could count to a hundred. I had already learned the system. I could count into the billions and trillions. As I remember it, he begged me to stop counting before I got even to a thousand. This day he suggested a walk in the garden before I could say, "Nine hundred and ninety-nine."

We walked down a row of radiant snapdragons. Carefully he pinched off one little face and holding it between his thumb and forefinger, he showed me how it could open and close its mouth. "Let's pick some," I suggested hopefully, and his answer was just a shake of his head. He pointed with his cane and we moved over to the cinnamon pinks—I can still smell them. In another part of the garden, I admired the stock and the phlox. I don't know at what point in our walk I began to beg constantly to be allowed to pick at least one flower. Perhaps I had been tempted by the peonies which Grandfather raised mostly for funerals, or by the sticky-stemmed moss roses.

Ears old that she and voice calling, "Wait 904 ur Visit was Over." He went into the house to sit in his favorite platform rocker with the crocheted antimacassar. I went back to my vigil by the front gate. That second choices are "petunias" and that they are flowers, too. So I've gone through life picking flowers and quite a few of them have wonderfied daughters! Each of them has brought me a grown-up son that I didn't have the responsibility of rearing; and one of them shares with me three chapters 7 @ No man likes to antagonize his employer, but Kim was in a cold rage at Mr. Shelton's coming to his home and offering to buy Kim's father's beloved family homestead in Utah.

"I told you Dad's place was not for sale, Mr. Shelton." "So you did," said Mr. Shelton, ignoring the flashing anger in Kim's eyes. "I figured if I talked to the real owner we might do business. I'm prepared to offer twelve thousand, sight unseen, just from your description of the property." "T wasn't describing it for sale. It is not for sale," repeated Kim. "Why don't you let me talk to your father about it?" said Mr. Shelton. "There's no need to," said Kim's father with dignity. "The place is not for sale, has never been for sale." If Kim hasn't, if Kim didn't want to—"

He looked at Kim and was reassured by the expression on his son's face. "The place is not for sale," he finished. "Sorry," said Mr. Shelton. "No offense meant. I really want that place, though, from your son's description, and if you change your mind." "Dad won't change his mind," said Kim ominously, with finality.

After Mr. Shelton had gone, Kim's father continued to think about the offer. "Are you sure, Kim? Why do I cling onto my possessions? I can't live much longer, and I can't work any more. If I sold the place, I could divide the money and give each of you children your share of the inheritance." "None of us has a share of inheritance, Dad. An inheritance is something left from one who dies, and you are not dead. None of us knows previously the date of his death. When we had the accident, I thought for a moment it was mine—and Tommy's. You could easily live ten or even fifteen more years, so now let us not talk of inheritances." "T wouldn't mind living that much longer, if she were alive," his father said wistfully, and they left the subject.

It seemed to mark a change from the negative to the positive for the rest of the family. With only three months to go, Rosemary and her mother were plunged into sewing sessions whenever Cary was not there to help Rosemary with the refinishing of the bed or some other piece she had picked up. A letter came to her as a result of the note she had left at the pawn shop. A Mr. Feidler assured her he had all the silverware she needed to make up her twelve place settings except one fork and he would be happy to keep on the lookout for that. It was still available at half the market price for new silver. Rosemary was overjoyed, and bought it immediately, as she had been saving for just this opportunity.

"Mother, if you have the cash you can buy things much cheaper," she said. "But you have to buy on the spot or you lose out." Tommy had persisted until he made the opportunity to talk to Lizbeth King. He reported the circumstance to the family. "T don't have much time to do things the proper way," he had told her bluntly, cornering her in the hall. "I meant what I said Heart Room for Home about marrying you, and I feel you should give me the opportunity to tell you why, for me to tell you about myself and for me to find out more about you. Every girl owes it to herself to explore all possibilities."

"What did she say to that?" said Rosemary. "Her answer threw me— for a moment. She said that obviously I knew all about her or I wouldn't have asked her to marry me, so why didn't we take ten minutes for a lemonade while she learned all about me," related Tommy. "The ten minutes stretched into four hours and we cut three classes.

I took her to the beach by that rocky cove and she is coming to dinner next Sunday." "To dinner? Here?" exclaimed Tommy's mother. "Oh, my goodness! What can we serve?" "Tommy, how masterful!" said Rosemary. "If you weren't my brother, I'd marry you myself. Those fierce eyes! That commanding lip!" "I wouldn't marry a spoiled brat like you," said Tommy, but he planted on her lips the kiss he no doubt longed to plant on Lizbeth. Rosemary pretended a swoon. "Tommy," wailed Mary Ann. "These drapes! That couch! What do you want served?" "Bees' knees on cinnamon toast," said Tommy. "Now, Mom, don't do one thing you wouldn't do for an ordinary Sunday dinner. My campaign is based on simple honesty. If she doesn't like my family the way they are, she can't like me. I told her the worst parts of my nature first off, and all the mean things I ever thought in my life." "You dared to do that?" said Rosemary. "Sounds as if you were trying to drive her off." "That's what she said, but it intrigued her so much she had to come to dinner to see what a monstrous family I belonged to." Kim and his father had been taking in the scene behind the newspaper. "Her fellow, the one she's engaged to, what about him?" "I didn't ask and she didn't tell me," said Tommy. "That's better," commented his grandfather. "King Arthur's knights—they couldn't always see their opponents, either, dressed up in armor as they were. In the end a man has to stand on his own merits, not on the demerits of his opponent." Of course Mary Ann went all out for the Sunday dinner, roast beef and Parker House rolls, her specialty, cherry pie, the best linen and crystal, the silverware polished to a satiny finish. Lizbeth had been visiting a friend the first time Tommy saw her at Church, but she lived in Alhambra with her parents, except for school where she boarded with a friend. Then Tommy went to fetch her and the table was set, the food ready for serving when they arrived. Of course Cary was there, but the girls and their families were otherwise occupied. Seven at the table, including Father Freeman, were not too many and gave time for adult conversation. Lizbeth was socially gracious, but reserved, and she was all that Tommy said— with a regal bearing and proud eyes, dark blue fringed with black lashes, a rosepetal skin and shining black hair to her waist. What Mary Ann and Kim liked about her was her modesty of dress, feminine and sweet. "I went to BYU," she explained. She listened more than she talked, but when she did make a contribution it was brilliant and to the point. She didn't really melt until after the meal, when Rosemary invited her to the garage to show what they were doing with the furniture. Cary and Tommy tagged along and they came back all chattering at once. She was intensely interested and big-eyed over Rosemary's silver. "Tell me exactly how you got it," she said. "I want that man's name because I want to do likewise. I think it is fabulous." "I like your girl," said Mary Ann in an aside to Tommy. Watching the metamorphosis of Tommy from an ordinary college student, a familiar son, into a man in love was like seeing a cocoon unfold into a brilliant butterfly. There were the hours of despair, when Tommy came home and threw himself, moaning, onto his bed, behind locked doors, and the hours when he was illumined with the sweet secrets of his love for Lizbeth. Finally, there came the day when he appealed to his mother. "I've got to talk to you, Mother. All through this I have been thinking of myself. Me! Tommy Freeman, as if my own happiness was all that mattered. Sometimes I think of this poor guy she is engaged to. He must be a pretty nice fellow to appreciate Lizbeth enough to want to marry her, and he's in Vietnam, fighting for his country. What right do I have to barge in if they are in love and were happy without me?" "Why did you come to me? This is a man's problem. Why didn't you ask your father?" "No! It's a woman's problem. Tell me what you think, would think if you were Lizbeth. Then I'll talk to Dad." "Tommy, you stated it fully the first time you spoke to Lizbeth. Any girl deserves a choice. Girls have been choosing between the men who love them since Eve. It is a sad thing for a girl to marry a man only because she has no other choice. Now you have gone so far it is out of your hands. Now it is Lizbeth's problem. What you need to find out from your father is how to take it if she chooses the other man. That has been the man's role since Adam." "You don't think I should back off now, then?" "Certainly, if you can." "That's just it. I can't." "Well, there's your answer, Son." Time picked up momentum as the weeks passed. Mary Ann, beleaguered with wedding plans, had little time to worry about her father-in-law beyond his meals and clean clothes, and nobody else did. He said little and dodged the ladders and paint buckets along with the rest of them. Swarms of young people came and went, Rosemary's bridesmaids and their friends, Cary's young men friends. The refrigerator door banged constantly as stores of food disappeared like butter on hot corn. "Like Grand Central Station," grumbled Kim. "When it's over I'll hibernate," promised Mary Ann. "The more I think of Dad's cool place in the summer the more I long to be there." As if there wasn't enough to do, getting the house cleaned, the sewing done, the wedding lists made out, the garden ready—for Rosemary had decided to have her reception there, with windlamps reflected in the pool—Tommy approached her to type his thesis. "You're a good typist, Mom. How about it? It would save the money and it is only sixty-five pages. There is a rush on it because the Dean has asked me to present it as a paper at the symposium and I want it to do double duty." She was opening her mouth to say she couldn't possibly when she remembered that Rosemary had taken most of her time. It was only fair that Tommy have some of it. The thesis turned out to be seventy-five pages done in practically a non-stop marathon, painstaking work, tables, graphs, and charts, but among the families he used as case histories to support his title "The Place of the Aged in Today's Society," their own stood out. His grandfather was etched sharp as a diamond—"No, I never took steps to build social security; I don't believe in milking the Government," and "No, I don't believe in insurance companies. It seems too much like trying to get something for nothing."

I put my money in the bank and those in-909 December 1969 insurance fellows can do the same. That way we're both ahead." His impact on the family was there—Rosemary's right-about face from dependence to independence, Tommy's own, even the change of Mary Ann from a fashionable working woman to a homemaker, and Kim's emergence as the real head of the household. All because they had brought Kim's father to live with them instead of selling his beloved homestead and putting him in a home for the aged. Tommy was fair. He showed how this might not work for some families. He outlined his parents' dilemma—the unfinished payments on the mortgage, the upkeep of a too large home when the children were gone. Tommy offered no solution, and Mary Ann wished he would. He was merely the scientific observer, and said it would be interesting to see the drama played out to the end, with a satisfactory solution for them all, or failure, and that it deserved further study. There was no time to think of either alternative just now, but both hovered over Kim and Mary Ann like dark-winged birds. The thesis was done and approved barely in time for Tommy's flight to Washington and the symposium, where he made a brilliant presentation of his paper, according to the Dean. It would be published in the fall and included in the Society's Proceedings of the Thirty-Fifth Annual Symposium. The newspapers picked it up as a "Revolutionary Solution to the Care of the Aged," and featured Hite "About as revolutionary as Methuselah," drily. Several offers of professorships at various colleges came of it, and Tommy was invited to submit a proposal to a scientific foundation for a sizeable grant to support further research on it. Lizbeth was at the airport to meet him and she looked at him with respect. Mary Ann noted she was not wearing her engagement ring. This was just an interlude, for they went back to the bridal showers for Rosemary given by her friends, the trousseau tea at the Freeman home, with the excited female relatives, and some of the male ones, coming and going, then exclaiming over her matched outfits of clothing, her linens and silver, everything beautiful for a bride. Her ivory white satin wedding dress was sheathed in her closet, her accompanying temple clothing pressed and packed into a small white case. Rosemary, with her mother's help, had not missed a detail to make her wedding perfect. It was Rosemary who drew the family's attention to her grandfather. "I don't remember hearing him speak a word in three weeks," she said. "And he looks sad and frail. I so wanted him at my wedding, but not if it will be too much for him. Grandpa's all right, isn't he?" Her father looked suddenly frightened, and guilt swept over Mary Ann. There was no doubt she had neglected her father-in-law in the excitement and hubbub in the last few weeks, doing only what was necessary for him and leaving the rest to Kim. But Kim had been kept on the run from the minute he got home until he could no longer see, fixing up the place for the wedding. "Grandfather, you are coming with us to the temple, aren't you? You promised, remember?" "What's that, Rosemary?" her grandfather answered, dragging his gaze from its faraway place. His eyes burned unnaturally bright in his pale face, and his clothes looked like a half-filled sack, he was so thin. His white hair, usually so well-kept, and his shaggy white eyebrows, looked slightly wild. "You promised to come to my wedding in the temple. Are you able?" "If I promised, darling, I will come. I always keep a promise." They took him with misgivings, and then the day was out of their hands—the wedding breakfast and the last minute preparations for the reception that night. He went to his room "to rest" he said, and when it came time for the reception he made his excuses that he was too tired to join them. Mary Ann fixed a supper tray and took it in. The wedding reception was a highlight for their family, the hundreds of guests from the ward, from Kim's work, from Mary Ann's and the children's associations coming and going was a kaleidoscope of loveliness. One of Kim's friends from work was most impressed with their home, their yard and gardens, the swimming pool, now dramatized at their best by the event. "Kim, you plutocrat! I had no idea you lived in a place like this." Heart Room for Home This pleased Kim, of course, and he murmured something about its being adequate for the family. "We never would have bought so big a place for ourselves—but the children." "Yes, the children. We've got seven of them, you know, and they are bulging the walls out of our place. We'd sure like to have an outlay like this." "How would you like this one?" Kim asked jokingly. "Are you serious?" demanded his co-worker. "Oh, could we?" abetted. His wife A: long last the affair was over, the last guest gone, the bride and groom having changed quickly and departed in a decorated car trailing old shoes and peppered with rice. Tommy, Lisbeth's hand in his, had also gone, borrowing the little car and tucking her in. There was no mistaking the stars in her eyes, nor the love in his. Barbara, Jennefer, Heidi, and Carol and their husbands, aided by all the children who were still on their feet, were retrieving tissue paper from Rosemary's room, where the gifts had been unwrapped, and were on the patio putting the gifts away. "Let's check on your father," said Mary Ann. The supper tray was still on the little table beside his bed, untouched, and Kim's father was on the floor, where he had obviously fallen in an effort to reach the bathroom, because he had been nauseated. Kim was terrified. "My father is dying!" he said. (To be concluded) Sil December 1969 912 Christmas Tune HOUSE Today as I sit in a warm, comfortable home that God has given me, I look out across our valley. Beautiful white snow covers all with its frosty coverlet, having fallen last evening, making everything a white fairyland. Looking to the east, I see the church spire, beautiful and tall, reaching toward God, inviting us to reach also, and find him, ever willing to help us in our upward climb. Beyond the spire to the east, the magnificent Wasatch Mountains, rising in their stately beauty and majesty, standing tall as protecting warriors, overlooking our lovely valley. As I turn my gaze westward, I find the guarding Oquirrhs, with their array of towers and blinking lights, ever present as those on the east. Surrounded by nature's barriers, our valley is serene and wonderful, filled with loving friends and neighbors who feel the love of Christ in their hearts and homes. We are thankful for the Christmas season, the beautiful lights, trees, and carols, reminding us again of the light brought into this world by the birth of Jesus Christ.

May we ever feel the warmth and security of peaceful homes in a beautiful valley, and be able to feel this love for others expressed in the celebration of Christmas. —Marcella H. Morley

Christmas Tree with Radiant Boughs
For this graceful Christmas tree a branch from a garden shrub was used as a foundation for the decorative feature. The surplus small twigs were removed from the branch and green leaves from an orange tree were attached with green florist's wire. The decorative satin balls in predominating colors of purple and fuchsia were also attached with wire, and the small lights added. This arrangement is particularly appropriate in a home where floor space is limited.

A Tree Decorated With Yellow Flowers
The tree was sprayed white and the large flowers, made of crepe paper or tissue paper, were attached with florist's wire. A few blue-green satin balls were interspersed among the white boughs. Sister Christensen who trimmed this attractive tree formerly lived in Parleys Stake, Salt Lake City, and is now a resident of Frankfurt, Germany.

Celebrating Christmas Without Going Into Debt, Mary E. Bergman
In the early years of our marriage the available money for Christmas expenditures was scarce. After listening to friends expound on the pitfalls of charge accounts that would take months to pay off, lavish gifts to children that seldom pleased them for more than a few weeks, and fancy holiday parties, I realized that it would be most advantageous to fall back on my own resources.

Often, the innocence of childhood can be changed into selfishness by parents who are unable to withstand the onslaught of hardsell tactics employed at Christmas time. Our gifts to Cathy that year totaled an expenditure of fifty-nine cents, but required hours of time and preparation. She was delighted, and her enjoyment of our homemade toys led me to believe that I had stumbled on a precious secret.

Throughout the years, my children and I have learned together the satisfaction of counters filled with delicious home-baked goodies. Amid the pleasant aromas in our home, we stitched "God Bless Our Home" samplers for each adult on our list, and we made stuffed toys of all varieties for the children, and a boxful to be sent to the Primary Children's Hospital.

For the entire holiday season, we become absorbed in sewing, gluing, baking, molding salt clay, painting, building, and so on. Mark, being a normal energetic boy, doesn't always adapt to these quiet occupations. One afternoon while Cathy and I were engrossed in a project, I gave Mark a bowl of vegetables to chop for homemade soup that was bubbling on the stove. He was fascinated by the process of putting raw materials into the kettle and afterward being able to savor the taste of the resulting soup.

Thereafter he became the official soup maker, starting from scratch and doing the entire project himself. We poured this soup into decorated quart jars to be delivered to various people.

A Thing of Beauty Is a Joy Candles of Elegance, Edythe K. Watson, Member, General Board of Relief Society

Relief Society women are ingenious. Show them a thing of beauty and lo! With their own magic hands they can create its likeness. Since variety is a necessary requisite of any worthy Relief Society project, they change and add, putting a new detail here and color there, enhancing and beautifying most every object.

Such it was with the candlesticks made by the sisters of Valley View Eighth Ward, Valley View Stake, under the direction of Sister Janet G. Ogden. Each one was different in color and design, and each was decorated by the sisters to blend and add charm to the decor of the different homes. The tall, more ornate candlesticks were designed for use in the living room or family room areas. The shorter, smaller ones were planned to grace a dining room or kitchen table.

A variety of finishes was used. Some were painted with a flat paint and finished with an antique glaze. The smaller ones were covered with enamel paint; the large ringed candles were stained in walnut finish with an antique glaze added. Flowers, fruits, greens, and ribbons were used to decorate them. Some of the sisters made their own candles where a particular color and size was needed.

Wreaths for the Christmas Season
A Wreath for Welcoming
The large wreath, eight feet wide and eight feet high, was made from a circle of plywood, covered with linoleum. Pine cones and gold and brown pods were attached to the circle with airplane glue. A large bow of plastic ribbon, bright green in color, decorated the top of the wreath. Small gold lights illuminated the wreath which was hung on a peg and attached to the house so that the lower part of the wreath formed the threshold to the house.

Treasure Chests For Christmas Johna de St. Jeor, Member, General Board of Relief Society

CJ In previous issues of The Relief Society Magazine there have been articles detailing the skills of d�coupage, gold leafing, and antiquing.* Now let us combine these artistic crafts into gifts that will be novel and pleasing to the most important people on our Christmas lists. Don't be afraid to try some delightful new combinations of materials and techniques. All it takes is the desire and the will. So, if you want to make something more than a whimsy for a gift, go ahead and do it.

Flowers Are For Christmas
Arrangement by Jean Rigby Hawthorne Ward, Sugar House Stake (1)

A predominating color for the arrangement was selected for use with harmonizing tones and tints. In this arrangement, purple, rose, blue, and green have been chosen, with gold for accent. The artificial flowers made of various types of plastic and other materials (and which may have served previously for other purposes and been discarded) were spray painted with either lacquer or enamel and thoroughly dried. A hemp rope, dyed purple, was used as a foundation for the flowers and balls, which were attached with florist's wire. In this arrangement, an antique brass scale was used for making the attractive and graceful design. The candles pick up the deeper shades of color, and the wreaths add to the effectiveness of the design placed against avocado colored walls.

Refinished Furniture � More Beautiful Than New
Refinishing by Virginia Lattin Bodell Balli, President, East Mill Creek Relief Society (Cl)

The furniture in the picture was first sanded down to smoothness, a coat of base flat paint applied, then the color coat, and, finally, a finishing coat of antique enamel. Decals, free-hand painting, or other decorative features should be applied before the final finish, which may require more than one coat for effective protection and lasting beauty.

Working With Knit Fabrics
Myrene T. Alvord (O)

Available on the market today are lovely knit fabrics for home sewing. Knit fabrics can be purchased by the tube or the yard. Many are like sweater material, although made by machine. Knowing a few tricks in handling these materials can open up a whole new world of fashion. One of the professional touches you can add to your outfit is to edge it with embroidery and/or crocheting. To be most effective, this should be done from the same yarn as your sweater is knit from. To do this, you must unravel yarn from your tube, which requires patience and know-how. Most knit tubes are made from four separate strands of wool or yarn, each of which has been machine locked. These must be unraveled into four separate balls. Never cut the tubing to unravel the yarn. At the top of most tubes (not the ribbing end) there is a rough edge which you must pick through before you reach the regular yarn. After this top edge has been carefully picked off, unravel one strand all around the tube and lay the small ball aside. Pick up the next until you have four small balls of yarn. Then pick up the first ball and repeat this process until you have enough yarn for the work you wish to do.

Something Different For Your Home Arrangements
by Florence G. Williams (O)

The covers for these delightful pillows were crocheted by Kate Schleich. Sister Williams thought up the idea of applying the brightly colorful figures of yarn. These made delightful Christmas gifts for her grandchildren.

A lovely arrangement of petunias in a Sevres (a rare French) bowl graced the piano of the Williams home at Christmastime. The gold angel and scented candle symbolized the season. Such arrangements can be made easily by purchasing a certain product from a floral shop, putting it in the bottom of the vase or bowl, soaking it with water, and arranging the flowers to suit one's taste.

A delightful arrangement of wheat and nuts graced the door of the lovely Gilbert Williams home in Salt Lake City, Utah, at Thanksgiving time. The squirrels are handmade of wood and were a gift to Sister Florence Williams. She gathered the wheat and purchased the nuts.

Swedish Lucia Queen and Attendants (O)

Each year in the Swedish Branch of the Church in Salt Lake City, Utah, the Lucia festival is held. In Sweden this is known as Little Christmas, and is held on the 13th of December, the longest night of the year in Scandinavia. Lucia means Festival of Light, and is symbolic of the triumph over darkness. The Lucia Queen is the Queen of Light, and spreads cheer and light throughout the villages, with the help of her attendants. The candles are of course symbolic, and this crown is imported from Sweden. Part of the festival includes a parade through the building, and lovely music. Following the celebration, there are refreshments and a visit from Saint Nicholas.

Swedish Cookery For Christmas
Darlene C. Dedekind Member, General Board of Relief Society (L)

A typical Swedish holiday meal would be aptly termed a feast. Many varieties of seafood make up the first course. This is followed by baked ham and red cabbage, which is followed by meat balls and various kinds of cheeses. The main course of the meal is Lutfisk, a traditional Swedish dish served with potatoes and a white sauce. Lutfisk is available in package form in many import stores. Rice pudding is the popular dessert for such a feast, and there are several interesting customs surrounding it. Among these is that one almond is included in the recipe, and the person who gets this will be married within the year.

This person is not to tell MODEL NANCY ANN JOHANSSON Swedish cookery for Christmas that he or she has it, but the excitement runs so high among the single girls, it is nearly impossible to keep it a secret. Before eating the rice pudding, each person is supposed to say a little rhyme he or she has made up, then light a candle. The first candle that burns down indicates that person has been naughty during the year. Following the feast, Santa Claus generally appears and the delightful festivities of Christmas begin. The straw animals in the picture are traditional Swedish decorations.

CHRISTMAS TREASURE CHESTS (continued from page 923)
JEWEL CASE FOR A LADY
Materials needed  
1 box of your choice either old or new, with or without drawers  
1/2 pint gesso (a type of Latex paint)  
1 pint satin finish lacquer (20 minutes drying time)  
small tubes artists' oil color in desired shade plus white Dutch gold (gold leafing sheets)  
gold leaf size and antiquing glaze  
old-fashioned print lace medallions and trim (new or antique)

Step 1. Select box (remove any knobs on the box)
a. If old finish, sand to smoothness ready for new finish.
b. If new wood, sand lightly, apply 1 coat of lacquer to seal the wood.

Step 2. Apply lace using a good quality glue. Move lace around until you have a pleasing design.
Step 3. Apply several coats of gesso.

The purpose is to fully permeate the lace and make it hard enough not to absorb further coats of finish. Be sure to dry thoroughly between coats.

Step 4. Apply color. A high grade satin finish lacquer that takes about 20 minutes to dry is best. Mix with artist's oil paints to the desired shade. Prepare sufficient paint to cover the surface at least four times. Apply two to three coats to whole box, lace and all, allowing time for thorough drying between each coat.

Step 5. Following directions for gold leafing, apply gold to lace area. When size is almost dry (about 40 minutes) apply the gold leaf and make no attempt to remove the loose excess gold until dry (overnight). Next day remove extra gold with a clean dry brush, seal with one coat of lacquer, smooth the edges of gilt area with a light touch-up of color.

Step 6. The print selected is cut to fit the area and carefully glued into place, being careful to squeeze out any air bubbles from under the paper (I used only the center from an 8 x 10 print and cut it to fit the round section). When glue is thoroughly dry apply multiple coats of lacquer to picture face. Since this picture was bordered with lace, forming a dike, I was able almost to puddle the lacquer and let it dry overnight.

Step 4 Mix lacquer with oil colors sections two coats of wood color. Paint plastic

Step 5 Apply decals by blue points to gold leaf surface sure air bubbles are squeezed out from under the designs. Dry, and seal with clear lacquer.

Step 6 Apply wood tone aze liberally to whole surface. On partly dry, use rubber gloves and cheese cloth or paper towels wipe off aze. On plastic areas wipe back and forth leaving glaze streaked over high relief area. In exposed sections carefully reveal just the design through the glaze let dry.

Wouldn't you like to make one for your home or for a very special Christmas gift? Here are the instructions:

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL VARIETIES The bases can be purchased from a wood turning shop or most carpenters can make any design you wish. A great variety is possible. Those shown in the pictures ranged from eight to thirty-two inches in height. Fill in any visible cracks. Lightly sand base with either 00 steel wool or fine sandpaper. Apply a sealer coat and let dry for 10 to 12 hours.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR WOOD STAINED CANDLESTICK 1-inch paint brush soft cloths wood stain antique glaze Apply stain with small soft cloth, allow to stand for 45 minutes. Rub off excess stain with another soft cloth. If a darker shade is desired, apply stain again in the same manner. Dry thoroughly. Apply antique glaze with small brush, let stand for 2 or 3 minutes, wipe off as much as you wish for desired effect.

ENAMELED CANDLESTICKS 1 small can enamel paint in color of your choice 1 1-inch brush Apply several coats, allow sufficient time between each coat to dry thoroughly. Sand lightly between each coat. As many as five coats may be needed for a satisfactory finish. These are very attractive done in decorator colors, orange, green, pink, blue, red, etc.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR ANTIQUED CANDLESTICKS Flat paint in any color of your choice or small can Bisque Wax (ceramic paint) may be used in its stead. (This paint is very economical, easy to handle, and comes in many colors.) 1 1-inch paint brush small can dull varnish antique glaze Sister Ogden makes her own glaze which she finds very easy to handle and is low in cost: 3 tsp. Turpentine 1 tsp. Linseed oil 1 tbsp. Tube coloring, either raw umber, cool color, burnt umber, warm color

Cover candlestick base with 2 coats of either the flat paint or Bisque Wax. Allow to dry thoroughly after each coat. Apply 1 coat antique glaze. Let stand for two to five minutes. With soft cloth or toilet tissue remove as much as you wish for highlighting. Klondike gold paint was used on those in picture. Let dry for 2 to 3 days. Cover with dull varnish, let dry for 12 hours.

If you choose gold as the color, a special paint is needed. Klondike gold paint was used on those in picture. Be sure to stir thoroughly before using and handle with great care since gold has a tendency to lift.

For decoration, cut styrofoam to desired size, carving out center to hold candle. Spray with green paint. Place atop candlestick base. Dip flowers, greens, or fruit stems in glue and then insert into styrofoam as you desire. Now sit back and enjoy these things of beauty.

Celebrating Christmas Without Going Into Debt

CELEBRATING CHRISTMAS WITHOUT GOING INTO DEBT (continued from page 918)

Finding the names of people who might not have a pleasant Christmas, and sharing with them, has brought unspeakable joy and insight to our family. Time after time my children have demonstrated unselfishness, and have put other people's happiness before their own desires. Such times make a parent's heart burst with pride.

To develop fully a child's imagination, toys should be interchangeable. Therefore, a truck should not look too much like a truck. It should quickly convert to a bus, fire engine, moving van, or any other four-wheeled conveyance. With this in mind, Tom, my husband, has built ride-in box carts that have served every imaginable purpose. He has cut blocks in all sizes and shapes, built work benches, bulletin boards, and other household accessories. My contributions include stuffed animals, rag dolls, bean bag toys, special dresses or costumes, hand puppets, and similar items.

Our children's accomplishments show real imagination, and they improve continually. Celebrating Christmas this way means burning the midnight oil every night for weeks. It means tolerating horrible messes from cookie decorating, salt clay, and other projects. Projects are in various stages of completion and must be stored everywhere. Boxes of scraps, spools, detergent and bleach bottles, pop bottle caps, and numerous other things are stacked high in storage, awaiting time for construction. The ironing doesn't always get done, and the house seems to be in utter chaos, and Christmas morning finds us physically exhausted, but spiritually refreshed.

We strive to remember the true meaning of Christmas, and to give thanks for the birth of the Savior, together, as a family united.

SPIRITUAL LIVING

The Doctrine and Covenants Lesson 102—Another of Joseph Smith's Contributions—Doctrine and Covenants

Elder Roy W. Doxey (Reading Assignment: Doctrine and Covenants, Section 135.)

Northern Hemisphere: First Meeting, March 1970
Southern Hemisphere: August 1970

OBJECTIVE: As the Latter-day Saint woman gains a greater testimony that the Doctrine and Covenants was brought forth by the Prophet Joseph Smith through divine inspiration, she seeks to conform her life to its teachings.

INTRODUCTION

The Doctrine and Covenants gives direction to the fulfilling of the Lord's promises unto the ancient prophets. The importance of this book in the plan of salvation was given at the November 1831, conference of the Church, in the following words of the Prophet Joseph Smith:...

Being the foundation of the Church in these last days, and a benefit to the world, showing that the keys of the mysteries of the kingdom of our Savior are again entrusted to man; and the riches of eternity within the compass of those who are willing to live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God—therefore the conference voted that they prize the revelations to be worth to the Church the riches of the whole earth, speaking temporally.

938

In appreciation for the books of scripture received from the Lord by that time, the following was also indicated by that conference:

The great benefits to the world which result from the Book of Mormon and the revelations which the Lord has seen fit in His infinite wisdom to grant unto us for our salvation, and for the salvation of all that will believe, were duly appreciated.... (Joseph Smith, History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Vol. 1, pp. 235-36 [commonly called Documentary History of the Church; hereafter referred to as DHC}.)

THE SALVATION OF MEN IN THIS WORLD

Among the reasons for the evaluation that Joseph Smith had done more for the salvation of men in this world than any other, except Jesus, was his bringing "... Forth the revelations and commandments which compose this book of Doctrine and Covenants." (D&C 135:3.)

As a modern book of revelation, the Doctrine and Covenants is directed to the people of this generation. It is the voice of the Lord Jesus Christ revealing the way of salvation, both in this life and in the world to come. There are three ways in which the Doctrine and Covenants makes this contribution.

(1) It warns individuals and nations of impending destruction if repentance is not forthcoming.
(2) It sets forth, in plainness, the gospel of salvation.
(3) It witnesses to the truth that there is a life beyond the grave.

A VOICE OF WARNING

When the revelations received up to 1831 were presented to a conference of the Church, the Lord gave his "Preface" to those commandments. In that revelation, reference is made to the apostate condition of the religious world and the nearness of the second coming of Christ. (D&C 1:11-12.)

His word is to be known to all men in this life, and in the life to come. The turning away from and the changing of the gospel of Jesus Christ in the past have brought many to seek after false gods. (D&C 1:15-16.)

Despite the fact that the gospel has been restored in its fulness, men will continue in error until, as Isaiah said, they are desolate; "... Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left." (Isa. 24:5-6.)

And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days. (D&C 1:3-4.) As stated in another revelation, the people of the world are under the bondage of sin, and, like ancient Israel, they have hardened their hearts; therefore, if they continue in this condition, they shall not enter into the Lord's rest, which is the fulness of his glory. (D&C 84:24; 49-50.) The second reason for raising a warning voice in our day is to let all people know of the frightening events which will engulf the world preceding and at the time of the second coming of Christ. (D&C 1:11-14, 34-35.) Almost every page of the Doctrine and Covenants makes specific reference to or related reference to the judgments which will be poured out upon the earth because of gross wickedness. Class Discussion How are we, as Latter-day Saint women, heeding the "voice of warning" of the revelations? WARS AND OTHER CALAMITIES Before the Church was organized, the angel Moroni quoted several Biblical prophecies pertaining to the last days and said that they would soon be fulfilled. (Joseph Smith, 2:36-41.) Among these prophecies was Malachi's regarding the time when the wicked would be consumed by fire. (Joseph Smith, 2:36-37.) In 1831, it was revealed that peace would be taken from the earth in that generation. (D&C 1:34-35.) Subsequently, these warnings were given: Ye hear of wars in far countries, and you say that there will soon be great wars in far countries, but ye know not the hearts of men in your own land. (D&C 38:29.) Ye hear of wars in foreign lands; but, behold, I say unto you, they are nigh, even at your doors, and not many years hence ye shall hear of wars in your own lands. (D&C 45:63.) On Christmas day 1832, the Lord revealed some specific information about the wars of the last days. He said that after the war between the North and the South in the United States, war would be poured out upon all nations. (D&C 87:1-3.) Furthermore, conditions would develop whereby slaves would rise up against their masters, and the remnants of the land of America (Indians) would vex the United States with a sore vexation. (D&C 87:4-5.) The inhabitants of the earth would mourn because of plagues, famine, and earthquake until the chastening hand of the Almighty would make "... A full end of all nations." (D&C 87:6.) The word of the Lord concerning the American Civil War and subsequent wars is being fulfilled. Can anyone doubt the "voice of warning" of wars among the nations of the earth in these last days? Class Discussion Wherein do rumors of war and warfare contribute to your understanding of the Doctrine and Covenants as a "voice of warning"? THE PLAINNESS OF THE GOSPEL That man might escape the judgments of the last days and also the more enduring judgment of the future life, the Lord has given the plan of salvation anew in plainness and simplicity. Elder Harold B. Lee of the Council of the Twelve suggested the following four things to be done to prepare a people for the second coming of Christ: They should be taught: (1) the personality and nature of God and his Son, Jesus Christ, (2) the divinity of the mission of Jesus as the Savior, (3) the necessity of being cleansed and purified and sanctified to be made worthy to receive the Lord, and (4) acceptance of the divine mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith. (Conference Report, October 1956, pp. 61-62.) The Doctrine and Covenants makes a significant contribution to our understanding of these truths. THE PERSONALITY OF GOD To know God is to receive eternal life, to be like him, and to be in his presence forever. (John 17:3; D&C 132:24.) Elder Harold B. Lee indicates in the following passage what one great thinker has believed concerning the need to know God as a personal being: Professor Hacking of Harvard in his "Meaning of God in Human Experience," made even a more significant statement when he wrote: "The alternative to the thought of God as a person is the thought of Him as a substance, as mere energy, and chiefly as law. Just stop and consider for a moment what it would mean for us to try to obey the will of substance, of love, of energy, or worship law, and you will have some idea at least of how near this question of the personality of God comes to the heart of true religion." (Conference Report, October 1956, p. 61.) When the "Christian" religious world was teaching that God is a spirit only, without body, parts, and passions, the Lord revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith that the Father and the Son are personal beings of flesh and bones. (Joseph Smith 2:17; D&C 130:22-23.) With the true personality and nature of God restored, believing men know what and how to worship. (D&C 93:19.) THE DIVINITY OF JESUS CHRIST In the "Christian" world belief in Jesus Christ as the divine Son of God, who died for man's sins and who was resurrected, has lost ground over the past several decades. People agree that he was a great teacher, but there are those who will not accept his divinity. The irrationality of such a belief is expressed by President Stephen L Richards in the following passage: There is certainly no consistency in accepting Christ as Lord, without accepting the whole of his Gospel as divine. I have never been able to understand how intelligent, educated men could reconcile the logic or illogic of accepting the authenticity of that portion of the record of the Savior which sets forth his incomparable teachings and philosophy, and at the same time, deny the correctness of the same record, which proclaims his Divine Sonship and Lordship. What justification is there for credence in a part of the record and not all of it; or believing some of the things Lesson Department the Master said and not all that he said? I admit that it may be easier, in that it requires less faith, to accept some parts, rather than other parts, but from the standpoint of the authenticity and validity of the record itself, which is admittedly the source from which we obtain our knowledge and information of the Christ, how can one part be true without all being true? To that question I have never been able to discover a satisfactory answer. (Conference Report, April 1935, pp. 29-30.) Latter-day Saints know by revelation that Jesus Christ is divine, the literal Son of God. Jesus Christ was the sinless Son of God, and therefore, the only person who could make an atonement for man. The prophesied atonement gave these two benefits: (1) redemption from the grave through the resurrection, and (2) redemption from sins committed by the individual during the years of accountability. (2 Ne. 2:6-10.) CLEANSED AND PURIFIED Salvation from sin comes only through Jesus Christ, for man cannot be saved in his sins.

(Alma 11:37, 40.) There is no exaltation without the acceptance of Christ as the Savior, by faith in him, repentance of sin, baptism by immersion by one having authority, and the receiving of the gift of the Holy Ghost. (3 Ne. 11:31-41; D&C 20:25; 29:17.) In addition, keeping all the other commandments provides a retention of the remission of sins. (Mosiah 4:25-30.) ACCEPT THE DIVINE MISSION OF JOSEPH SMITH The fourth and final point Elder Lee believes is necessary to prepare a people for the second coming of Christ is the acceptance of Joseph Smith as a prophet. Latter-day Saints do not worship Joseph Smith, but they believe that he received revelations from God to perform a work which is greater than any other's except that of Jesus Christ. (D&C 135:3.) Missionaries of the Church teach investigators of the gospel to pray that the Holy Ghost will testify to them that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God, that the work established by him, under divine guidance, is God's plan. When a person learns by the Spirit that God has restored his Church and gospel through Joseph Smith, then he is prepared to accept all of the restored gospel. The convert's knowledge may not be extensive, but by the testimony of the Spirit he knows the fundamental truth that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the "only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth." (D&C 1:30.) God sent his holy angels to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery to confer upon them the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthoods so that saving ordinances could be performed by men holding the priesthood, which ordinances would be accepted by God. (D&C 27:7-8, 12-13.) The Doctrine and Covenants not only contributes information on the restoration of God's authority, but it also affirms the fact that without this authority the ordinances of salvation are invalid. (D&C 20:18-20; 84:18-22.) In several other ways the Doctrine and Covenants attests to the divine mission of Joseph Smith. Detailed information on Church organization and government is a unique contribution to the validity of this mission. (D&C 1:35; 49:24-25; 87; 130:12-13.) The Doctrine and Covenants contributes to the salvation of man by reaffirming and clarifying doctrines which are obscure or fragmentary in the Bible. Outstanding are the revelations concerning man's nature, the purpose of his life on earth, and of his future. It affirms that man is a child of God, born of divine Parents in a premortal world. (D&C 76:24; 93:29.) The Doctrine and Covenants reveals that by the spirit and the body becoming a soul in mortality, the resurrection through the atonement is assured, and through obedience to the principles of the gospel, man may receive a fulness of joy. (D&C 88:15-16; 93; 76:58-60; 132:20-21; 93:33-34.) Among some of the unique teachings of this book of scripture are tithing and the Word of Wisdom. (D&C 89; 119.) It is learned from these revelations that men may reach the divine destiny of godhood by obedience to gospel principles and ordinances, including marriage for eternity. (D&C 131:1-4; 132:15-21.) Class Discussion How do the four points given by Elder Lee to prepare a people for the second coming of Christ explain the fact that Joseph Smith contributed to the salvation of men in this world? REALITY OF THE FUTURE LIFE The third major way in which the modern revelations contribute to the salvation of men in this world is their attestation to the truth that man lives beyond the grave. They do this in two ways: (1) by testifying to the reality of the resurrection, and (2) by the testimonies of men who have seen the resurrected Christ. Man will be resurrected with a body of flesh and bones, never to experience death again. (D&C 88:27-32, 96:102; 130:18.) In addition to considerable light being given on man's resurrection, specific information is given concerning the appearance of resurrected beings in our day. (D&C 27:5, 7-8, 12-13; 110; 128:19-21.) Thus, further enlightenment is given concerning messages from, or the appearance of, individuals who have lived upon the earth, died, and then been raised to immortal life. In the Doctrine and Covenants three persons testify to a sight-knowledge of the Savior. Joseph Smith, Oliver Cowdery, and Sidney Rigdon beheld the resurrected Lord. The first two were in the Kirtland Temple, on April 3, 1836, when they saw the glorified Lord. (D&C 110:1-10.) Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon beheld God, Jesus Christ, and angels in vision at Hiram, Lesson Department Ohio, on February 16, 1832. (D&C 76:19-24.) Class Discussion How does the Doctrine and Covenants contribute to man's salvation by giving evidence to the reality of life after death? IMPLEMENTATION The Doctrine and Covenants was given by the Lord for this generation. Its message is intended to save people from their sins and to exalt them in the celestial kingdom. When one considers the great truths of salvation found in this book of scripture, he is impelled to exclaim that it is truly of God. In the words of President Wilford Woodruff: "We have the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, our Testament, which contains the most glorious, godlike, solemn and eternal truths ever recorded within the lids of a book on the earth." (Journal of Discourses 22:331.) Joseph Smith was the mortal instrument, under divine guidance, to bring forth this book of revelations. Blessings come not only by acquiring the understanding of doctrines and principles through study, but also by faith. (D&C 88:118.) POETIC URGE What is this flashing inside me? A surging, insistent demand For release. Perhaps I shall In giving form to light Find peace. —Margaret B. Jorgensen 943 VISITING TEACHER MESSAGE Truths to Live By (Correlated With the Family Home Evening Manual, 1968-69) Message 6—Faith in Christ Alice Colton Smith Northern Hemisphere: First Meeting, March 1970 Southern Hemisphere: August 1970 OBJECTIVE: To know that faith needs constant nourishment. He was the ideal to many: tall, handsome, eloquent, and congenial. A mighty speaker, he persuaded many to join the Church. Then one day, someone else was given a position that many thought would be his. Gradually a sour note crept into his conversations. He grew less and less active in the Church. Long before he died the mighty voice no longer thundered of faith in God. The warm personality became an unhappy critic. His influence dwindled until most people forgot that he had ever been a great leader in his community. Many are the reasons for lost faith in God. Each has its subtle poison. To avoid such loss, faith, like all knowledge, must be constantly renewed and expanded. How do we nourish faith? How do we keep it alive, vibrant with spiritual health? For many, faith is buffeted by winds of doubt as well as attacked by subtle poisons. How do we protect ourselves against such evils? Who can explain this better than Alma who once worked so hard to destroy faith? In a beautiful simile, Alma graphically explains faith's pattern of growth. His message of hope comparing faith to a seed begins by strengthening us with the knowledge that "..."

God is merciful unto all who believe on his name." (Alma 32:22.) This seed is enriched by humility and watered by the desire to believe. Faith is fed by open-mindedness and the search for truth. One must then exert oneself— in the words of Alma—"awake and arouse your faculties.." (Alma 32:27.) In our day of scientific interest, out of the past Alma invites us to experiment in seeking faith. What are the steps in this experiment? 

1. We must pray with a sincere heart. Unbelief has no place. No researcher finds an answer if he makes up his mind before he begins that he will not find it.
2. We must study. "Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me" (John 5:39) counseled Jesus.
3. We must be long-suffering. A dedicated scientist pursues truth regardless of obstacles, differences of opinion, or long years of effort.
4. We must be patient. Research scientists spend long hours in planning, work, analysis, and evaluation.
5. We must be diligent. The solution of difficulties requires perseverance.

How can we know when the experiment is producing favorable results? There is a swelling sensation within us. The soul is enlarged. The understanding is enlightened. The knowledge that there is something good floods the soul. Alma said that the fruit of all this effort "... Is sweet above all that is sweet, and white above all that is white, yea, and pure above all that is pure; and ye shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are filled, that ye hunger not, neither shall ye thirst." (Alma 32:42.)

Without nourishment faith dies. Properly fed it is "a tree springing up unto everlasting life." (Alma 32:41.)

HOMEMAKING—Development Through Homemaking Education
Woman's Role in Family Preparedness Discussion

6. "She Is Not Afraid of the Snow for Her Household: For All Her Household Are Clothed With Scarlet." (Proverbs 31:21)

Celestia J. Taylor

Northern Hemisphere: Second Meeting, March 1970
Southern Hemisphere: August 1970

OBJECTIVE: To alert the Latter-day Saint woman to the wisdom of preparing for family security through home storage of basic items other than food.

INTRODUCTION

If a family is to be self-sustaining over a period of at least a year ahead, provision must be made for other physical needs in addition to that of food. It is satisfying and rewarding to know the security of having a supply of food in the house, but with it we should not lose sight of the other basic needs. Food alone will not suffice if the family is cold, without sufficient clothing, or improperly housed. The sanitary and healthful needs of the family should also be taken into consideration if we are adequately to protect our families from sickness and want.

OUR CLOTHING NEEDS

One of the most important of the physical needs in our family preparedness program is that of clothing. To supply our family with clothing for a year ahead is not so difficult as it may appear to be. Certainly, it will not entail a significant stretching of our budget because, in many cases, we will find that we already have a very good start toward that year's supply. We should take inventory of the present wardrobe of each family member to determine what is needed and then proceed to complete the wardrobe needs as we are able to.

We should make our clothing purchases with the idea in mind of long-term wear, especially in such things as outer clothing and footwear. As in all our expenditures, the methods of wise buying and spending should be followed. We should be aware of good buys on yardage and have some on hand. Very often money can be saved by doing our own sewing. We should shop the clothing sales in the early autumn months and during the post-Christmas season. As much as fifty per cent can be saved on staple items of clothing which various members of the family will need during the year.

There are many items for sale which are not subject to style changes and which will be appropriate for not only one but several years. Included with regular clothing should be ample bed clothes— sheets, pillow cases, blankets, and quilts. Nothing is quite so uncomfortable as trying to sleep in an unheated room with inadequate bedding. In the event of a shutoff of gas or electricity or both, ample bedding is a safeguard and a protection.

HOW SHALL WE KEEP WARM?

We should make sure, to begin with, that our homes are insulated as fully as possible in the walls as well as the windows. Our fuel bills can be reduced considerably by taking such precautions.

1. A fireplace is a convenient asset.
2. A year's supply of fuel is advisable.
3. Bottled or canned heat can be stored for emergency cooking where a stove is not possible.

PRECAUTIONS FOR FAMILY HEALTH AND WELL-BEING

We need to feel assured that our family's health will not be jeopardized in the event of personal or national disaster. We should look ahead and invest in regular physical and dental examinations as a preventive measure against medical emergencies in the year ahead. It would also be wise to have on hand medical literature that will help under all conditions.

Satisfactory bandages can be prepared from clean sheeting material if they are rolled and then sterilized for twenty minutes in a 150° to 175° oven. They should then be carefully packed to keep in sterile condition.

SUGGESTED LIST OF STORAGE ITEMS OTHER THAN FOOD

Soaps (hand and laundry)
Cleansers
Toilet and other tissue paper
Towels and napkins
Paper plates and cups
Tooth paste and brushes
Shampoo:
Matches
Needles and pins
Thread and buttons
Scissors
Candles
Hammer, axe, and saw
Nails and screws
Flashlight and batteries
Can and bottle openers
Clean cloths
Pencils and paper
Personal items of other kinds

This list could be added to or deleted as circumstances might warrant. Many of these items are already a part of a family's permanent equipment.

CONCLUSION

We can rest securely when we know that the needs of our family will be met in the event of an emergency that might cut off our source of supply. We will be happy in the knowledge that we have followed the advice of our leaders in preparing our homes and families for whatever lies ahead.

SOCIAL RELATIONS—Immortality and Eternal Life

Lesson 6—A Position of Honor

Alberta H. Christensen (Reference: Immortality and Eternal Life, Vol. 2, Selections from the Writings and Messages of President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., Melchizedek Priesthood Course of Study, 1969-70, Lessons 1-5.)

Northern Hemisphere: Third Meeting, March 1970
Southern Hemisphere: August 1970

OBJECTIVE: To point out that the role of woman is essential to the eternal plan of creation and that she therefore occupies a position of honor.

Speaks with great understanding and appreciation of the important role of woman in the eternal plan of creation. He discusses the home, children, and the responsibilities of homemaking. Relief Society members, generally, are familiar with the essential teachings of the gospel relative to the importance of the woman-role. There are, however, occasions when a woman may ask in all honesty, "Is my role as a woman really important? If so, how important?" This lesson will, of necessity, be generally theological for the priesthood lessons with which it correlates are doctrinal in nature and we shall quote much from President Clark's addresses. All Latter-day Saint women should know why and how essential their contribution is to the purposes of the Lord.

ESSENTIALS TO CONSIDER -In order to discuss fully the position of the woman in the eternal plan, a review of fundamental facts generally familiar may be encouraging to all women and give assurance to the woman in doubt. Certain truths given to us through accepted scripture follow:

1. At the great pre-earth council in heaven, two plans for creating and peopling the earth were presented:
   (a) Satan's plan, which would destroy the agency of man, would insure redemption to every soul but it would prevent all growth and progress which are the results of overcoming obstacles.
   (b) The plan proposed by the Only Begotten and accepted by a majority of the spirit children of the Father, would leave man his free agency, thus giving him the opportunity to advance in wisdom and knowledge and righteousness by overcoming error and sin.

2. The plan of the Only Begotten, which was accepted, included the creation of an earth upon which these spirit children might dwell during a period of earth life. We read of this truth in the Book of Abraham: "We will go down for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell." (Abr. 3:24.)

3. According to the scriptural sequence, the earth was created in six creative periods. Abraham records the creation of man, which was directed by the Only Begotten, in these words:
   "And the Gods formed man from the dust of the ground, and took his spirit (that is, the man's spirit), and put it into him; and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul." (Abr. 5:7.)

4. The Lord planted a garden, recorded as the Garden of Eden, in which he planted two special, fateful trees—the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. He gave specific commandments to Adam about the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

5. Further scripture records:
   "And I, the Lord God, took the man, and put him into the Garden of Eden, to dress it, and to keep it." (948)
   "And out of the ground I, the Lord God, formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and commanded that they should come unto Adam, to see what he would call them; and they were also living souls; for I, God, breathed into them the breath of life, and commanded that whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that should be the name thereof." (Moses 3:15, 19-20.)

We read that all things were created spiritually before they were created temporally. Just how the creation was accomplished the scriptures do not tell us. Such information would, in fact, be of little importance to this lesson. It is important to note that:
   Up to this point all that had been accomplished, according to the scriptures, had been done by the priesthood, also that Adam was alone in the Garden of Eden, for there was no helpmeet for him. (See the foregoing scripture.)

President Clark suggests that perhaps Adam may have recalled "... The eternal truth of motherhood," so beautifully voiced by Eliza R. Snow in her great poem:
   "In the heavens are parents single? No; the thought makes reason stare!
   Truth is reason, truth eternal tells me I've a mother there." (Immortality and Eternal Life, Vol. 2, lesson 3.)

We recall that God gave Adam and Eve this commandment: "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth...." (Moses 2:28.) Upon fulfillment of this great command, so given, depended the whole plan of the great council in heaven, because those who kept their "first estate" must have opportunity to come to earth to obtain mortal bodies that they might be proved in this "second estate... To see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever." (Abr. 3:25-26.)

To provide mortal bodies and a mortal life and experience for the waiting spirits was the very purpose of the creation. Yet, notwithstanding the great powers of the Priesthood which he held, Adam was powerless to go forward by himself, to the providing of earthly tabernacles for the spirits eager to enter into their "second estate." Adam alone, no matter what his priesthood, could not bring this about. (Immortality and Eternal Life, Vol. 2, lesson 3.)

Our first earthly parents began an earthly family unit of which President Clark speaks in the following paragraph as he pictures the possible, ultimate destiny of the righteous earthly family:
   "Thus every earthly family unit that is properly begun by a marriage in a House of the Lord, performed by one having authority thereto, has within its reach this infinite opportunity of eventually becoming creators after eternities of schooling and preparation; they have the infinite opportunity of heading another celestial family, which means the power and opportunity of creating worlds and peopling them. This is the supreme work, the very highest glory of which God has told us. Even its appreciative contemplation is almost beyond our finite reach." (Ibid., lesson 1.)

(See also, Joseph Smith, History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Vol. 5, p. 391 [commonly called Documentary History of the Church; hereinafter referred to as DHC].)

There are the essential facts which form the basis for our understanding of the significance of the role of woman in the eternity of life.

Questions:
1. How may a review of these essential facts assure women that they hold a position of importance in this the "second estate"? Discuss.
2. Do you think that women who do not believe in a pre-existent life may find it difficult to cultivate an assurance of general importance in life? If so, why? Discuss.
3. What must we do to keep our "second estate"?

INTO THE GARDEN

From a word picture of the Garden of Eden and of our first mortal parents, Adam and Eve, we quote the following from President Clark: "So came Eve, an helpmeet to the priesthood mission of Adam—Eve the last created being in the creation of the world. Without whom the whole creation of the world and all that was in the world would have been in vain, and the purposes of God have come to naught. Receiving her, Adam took her in her purity, took her, radiant and divinely fair, into the Garden he had dressed and kept for her, into the bridal home he had built, into the Garden that from then till now has been the symbol of heaven on earth, there to begin together their earthly life, that was finally to bring opportunity for salvation and exaltation to the untold myriads of spirits then waiting for the mortal tabernacles these two were to make it possible for them to possess. The Only Begotten had fashioned the world, had filled it with beautiful flowers and lofty forests, with grasses and grains, and multitudes of living creatures; Adam had had some part in this. But the key to the glorious arch of temporal, earthly creation for man was still missing. So Eve came to build, to organize, through the power of the Father, the bodies of mortal man, to be a creator of bodies under the faculties given her by the Priesthood of God, so that God's design and the Great Plan might meet fruition. This was her calling; this was her blessing, bestowed by the priesthood. This is the place of our wives and of our mothers in the Eternal Plan. They are not the bearers of the priesthood; they are not charged with carrying out the duties and functions of the priesthood; nor are they laden with its responsibilities; 949 December 1969 they are builders and organizers under its power, and partakers of its blessings, possessing the complement of the priesthood powers and possessing a function as divinely called, as eternally important in its place as the priesthood itself.

The crowning glory of motherhood came to the daughters of Eve, when, in Bethlehem, there was born to Mary of Nazareth a mortal, the Christ child, begotten of the Father. (Immortality and Eternal Life, Vol. 2, lesson 3.)

TO KEEP IN MIND

Thus, for the woman who may wonder about her opportunity to make a worthwhile contribution, we repeat that righteous motherhood is fulfilling "... A function as divinely called, as eternally important in its place as the priesthood itself." (Ibid.) A teaching which has been expressed many times in Relief Society lessons, also is repeated here. Not all wives are mothers; not all adult women in the Church are wives, often from no fault of their own. Relevant to this situation President Joseph Fielding Smith states: "Now, just one more thought. You good sisters, who are single and alone, do not fear, do not feel that blessings are going to be withheld from you. You are not under any obligation or necessity of accepting some proposal that comes to you which is distasteful for fear you will come under condemnation. If in your hearts you feel that the gospel is true and would under proper conditions receive these ordinances and sealing blessings in the temple of the Lord, and that is your faith and your hope and your desire, and that does not come to you now, the Lord will make it up, and you shall be blessed— for no blessing shall be withheld. The Lord will judge you according to the desires of your hearts when blessings are withheld, and he is not going to condemn you for that which you cannot help." (Joseph Fielding Smith, Elijah the Prophet and His Mission, p. 51.)

FOR THE "SECOND ESTATE"

President Clark speaks of the ideal Latter-day Saint home where parents fulfill their responsibilities in righteousness. He impressively visualizes the return of the mothers from their earthly missions into the presence of the Father of all, to give account of their stewardship. The picture he projects is a glorious goal to which all Latter-day Saint mothers would do well to keep in mind.

When the souls shall return to the presence of the Father of all, the worthy mothers will be there to welcome their worthy children; and with humble pride born of righteous achievement, they will reverently bow and humbly speak: "Father, we come back to thee with the righteous souls whose earthly bodies thou lettest us to build, 'bone of our bone, flesh of our flesh,' all to thine everlasting honor and glory and to our blessing and exaltation forever. Blessed were our wombs, for they bore children, even as thou didst command, in the image of thine Only Begotten, who is in the image of thee. Great is the joy of this the end of our labors, for these souls have been saved with eternal life. Blessed were we in our example set, for thou gavest us the power to live worthily; in the teaching of thy children, thou didst give us a goodly measure of wisdom. Blessed were we in our understanding, for thou didst cause the Holy Ghost to enlighten our minds. Blessed were we in our living, for thou didst give us patience and kindliness, and forgiving natures, with charity and unbounded love. Blessed were we that thou didst send these spirits to the bodies which we by thy power fashioned, for they were choice spirits. Blessed were we in their companionship, for they were loving and kind, respectful and obedient to us. Blessed were we in the mortal fathers of our children's bodies, for they gave us comfort and help, and love and kindness unmeasured, and likewise walked worthily before thee. Our souls cry out to thee, our Father, in worship of thee, for thou hast been with us from the beginning and hast covenanted to be with us during all eternity. Honor and glory and love to thee forever, and forever.

Then we shall believe the Father will say to the mothers: "Well done, thou good and faithful handmaids, enter thou into the rest I have prepared for those who builded the mortal temples in which dwelt the spirits I created, that they might keep their second estate, for without the keeping of their second estate they could not have 'glory added upon their heads for ever and ever' (See Abraham 3:26)." And then the priesthood will wish to proclaim their debt to these their helpmeets without whom the priesthood could not have worked out their destiny. These, wives and mothers in Israel, are your rewards and your destinies. And your offspring, saved and exalted in the presence of God, will never forget you, will ever bless you, and will sing hymns of eternal gratitude for the bodies you gave them and taught them to make the temples of the Spirit of God.

GUEST ROOM Here, as a child I came to read Into its quiet before day's end, The great old Bible, too heavy to lift, With copied engravings and all it contained; I read, and reread, each of the prophets— My tears blurred the pages where Christ was arraigned. Now the home must go for mother's away, This beautiful room where a friend could stay; Lesson Department God be thanked for the knowledge he has given us of all this. (Immortality and Eternal Life, Vol. 2, lesson 3.) SUMMARY Thus in our existence here, we are carrying out the plan which was made for the great celestial family of which we are a part; we are going forward as the children of our God and fitting into the pattern he made for us. The place we shall hold in God's household, in God's family, in our heavenly and eternal home, whether it shall be in the inner family circle, or outside in the halls and anterooms, depends wholly upon what we ourselves do here. (Ibid., lesson 1.) Question Could a Latter-day Saint woman, after reading and discussing the foregoing essentials of the gospel plan, doubt the importance of her inherent role? For Home Doing Appreciate, in your own thinking, the enlightenment which the gospel gives us regarding the purposes of life. Put forth effort on at least one aspect of family life which will forward the family unit toward its high destiny. But the guests in the book were the ones we loved best, Isaiah, and Matthew, and all of the rest. Linnie F. Robinson 951 CULTURAL REFINEMENT Ideals of Womanhood in Relation to Home and the Family Lesson 5—The Necessity of Service Dr. Robert K. Thomas Textbook: Out of the Best Books, Volume 5 Community Responsibility, Section Five By Bruce B. Clark and Robert K. Thomas "Humblest service done by willing and discerning souls is glory." George Eliot Northern Hemisphere: Fourth Meeting, March 1970 Southern Hemisphere: July 1970 OBJECTIVE: To emphasize that service makes a citizen out of an inhabitant and a community out of a town. ART "The Blind Girl" by John Everett Millais (1829-1896) English (September 1969 Relief Society Magazine, p. 688.) Commentary on art selection by Floyd E. Breinholt, Chairman, Department of Art, Brigham Young University. (September 1969 Relief Society Magazine, p. 689.) What do you think of when you see this picture? "The Blind Girl" is not difficult to understand. It could be said to be true to nature with an obvious message. Try asking a group of people of any age to look at the painting and tell the story. Abstract the story into one word and see how often it will be "service." John Everett Millais was a precocious child. He was recognized as having great talent at age four. At seven he was drawing amazing likenesses of family and friends. At eleven he was accepted into the Royal Academy as its youngest student and was later elected to membership. Early in his career as an artist he and several friends formed a group known as Pre-Raphaelites, who set principles of painting somewhat contrary to the accepted manner of painting of the time. They believed art should be based upon and be true to nature and represent sincere expression of sincere beliefs and adhere to the gospel of thoroughness. As a result, Millais' work was full of detail, yet there was nothing harsh. The details were absorbed in the whole truth without detracting from the complete, satisfying beauty of the canvas. As is so often the case, he was severely criticized by the critics of his time. His most enduring work, "The Blind Girl," has proved to be one for which he was most condemned. One said, "We must protest against sweet, lollipop colours, raw green fields, and lace-up boots ostentaciously large." In Millais' time, he was a revolutionist and it is chiefly because of his revolutionary works that he lives today.... 952 INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS A woman may live in a particular neighborhood without identifying with it, but her most casual act of service to that neighborhood—if no more than soliciting the block in which she lives in behalf of a philanthropic fund—gives coherence and special meaning to an area and often helps set an attitude toward the larger whole of which her neighborhood is part. We can't serve and remain totally unconcerned—as anyone knows who has tried to recruit volunteers to canvas for worthy causes—even, however, it is difficult to find prospective helpers whose vision of their contribution is not bounded by the walls of their house and the fences of their yard. This is not to question the priority of home. But it does suggest that seeing one's home in context can prepare one to be more effective in every sense; for the happy, developing family is part of a neighborhood, a city, a country. The opening selections in this section on service, therefore, focus on an expanded view of the individual. "SONG OF MYSELF" BY WALT WHITMAN In volume two of Out of the Best Books we presented two poems by Walt Whitman and a brief biographical sketch. The stanzas we include in this section are from the work which is most characteristic of him—Leaves of Grass. What Whitman has to say to most of us in this poem is not to be afraid to enjoy life and to expand that capacity to its fullest. Lesson Department Only if we are keenly alive to that going on about us will we be able to serve at our highest capacity. In the final section which we reprint from Whitman's "Song of Myself," he stresses the insights which recognition of our common humanity can bring to us: These are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, they are not original with me, If they are not yours as much as mine they are nothing, or next to nothing, If they are not the riddle and the untying of the riddle they are nothing, If they are not just as close as they are distant they are nothing. This is the grass that grows wherever the land is and the water is, This the common air that bathes the globe. "TO FIGHT ALOUD" BY EMILY DICKINSON Whitman's identification with everything—both good and bad—needs the corrective of Emily Dickinson's discipline in "To Fight Aloud." To fight aloud is very brave, But gallanter, I know, Who charge within the bosom, The cavalry of woe. Who win, and nations do not see, Who fall, and none observe, Whose dying eyes no country Regards with Patriot Love. We trust, in plumed procession, For such the angels go, Rank after rank, with even feet And uniforms of snow. For someone committed to the gospel, Whitman's total identification is not sufficiently discriminating. We need to be aware of the world that surrounds us, but we are not content to accept its degradation as well as its exaltation. Awareness should not imply justification. 953 December 1969 Miss Dickinson's poem is a fine example of discriminating awareness in considering human potential.

She suggests that only if our view of ourselves transcends earthly concerns are we ready to see our divine possibilities.

"A Wreath for Miss Totten" by Hortense Calismer

In "A Wreath for Miss Totten," we encounter the selflessness which "To Fight Aloud" praised. This story may have a school setting but it is not so much a story of education as it is a revelation of that capacity and determination to help young people grow that distinguishes those who truly teach, whether in the school or the home.

As the writer of this touching story recalls, there was little, if any, recognition of the total effort Miss Totten was expending for Mooley Davis. Perhaps the principal was sensitive to the result of her labor, but few of the children seemed lastingly impressed. The writer is not at all sure that Mooley herself attended Miss Totten's funeral. The fact that her actions did have a permanent effect on at least one of her students, who was only indirectly involved, has little relevance to the actions themselves.

Miss Totten wasn't working for recognition; one has the feeling that she didn't expect gratitude. Service, for her, was as natural as breathing and as little thought about.

Question for Discussion: If, as the scriptures tell us, we find our lives in losing them, how might Miss Totten have found hers?

"CONCORD HYMN" by Ralph Waldo Emerson

A monument to the Minute Men who fought the British troops at Concord in 1775 was set up in the middle 1830's on a piece of land which had been presented to the town by one of Ralph Waldo Emerson's forbears. Although Emerson himself could not be present for the dedication of the monument on the Fourth of July, 1837, the hymn he had composed for the event was sung by a choir to the tune of "Old Hundred."

Although this poem has been so widely reprinted that its opening stanza is one of the best known in American poetry, its final lines are almost forgotten. It needs to be seen in its entirety if it is to be fully appreciated:

By the rude bridge that arched the flood,
Their flag to April's breeze unfurled,
Here once the embattled farmers stood
And fired the shot heard round the world.
The foe long since in silence slept;
Alike the conqueror silent sleeps;
And Time the ruined bridge has swept
Down the dark stream which seaward creeps.
On this green bank, by this soft stream,
We set today a votive stone;
That memory may their deed redeem,
When, like our sires, our sons are gone.
Spirit, that made those heroes dare
To die, and leave their children free,
Bid Time and Nature gently spare
The shaft we raise to them and thee.

The shot was not "heard round the world" because a few loosely organized men engaged in a skirmish with those they thought of as oppressors. History is full of defiant deeds in support of causes, and the Colonists in America appear to have been under the mildest of yokes. It is the attitude of those who were willing to die that Emerson would have us remember.

In mutually shared devotion to principles which seemed to them to be violated, they ceased being Colonists and became Americans.

Note, in the final stanza, that the memorial is not simply to the men who died or to the circumstances surrounding their sacrifice; it is also to the "spirit" which prompted them to serve their country nobly.

Question for Discussion: How might the same "spirit" Emerson talks of prompt us to serve our country today?

"AIRMAN'S LETTER"

Among the personal belongings of a young Royal Air Force pilot in a bomber squadron, who was killed in execution of his duty, was a letter to his mother, to be sent to her if he were killed. The letter was sent to the bereaved mother by the young officer's station commander, who asked for permission to publish it anonymously. The permission was granted.

The anonymous "Airman's Letter" is a more current example of the dedication Emerson discusses in "Concord Hymn." At a time when clamorous voices are being raised against the draft of young men to serve their country, the clear, committed voice of this British airman is reassuring.

Mother of Comptons

By Milton S. Mayer

"The Story of Jephthah's Daughter" - Judges, Chapter 11.

The final two selections in this section, "Mother of Comptons" and "The Story of Jephthah's Daughter," illustrate lives given over to Christian service. Mrs. Compton is explicit in citing the Bible as the source of the direction she and her husband provided for their children. The nameless daughter of Jephthah simply takes for granted the sacredness of her father's promise to the Lord.

Mrs. Compton is not playing at being a wife and mother; and she is not viewing her roles here so narrowly that she cannot be an inspiration whenever she needs to be. Jephthah's daughter would like to be a mother in Israel but she is quite prepared to accept the role that her father has imposed on her.

In the totality of their commitment, both Mrs. Compton and Jephthah's daughter face the consequences of their belief with confidence and serenity.

Question for Discussion:

1. Mrs. Compton lives for what she believes.
2. Jephthah's daughter dies for what she accepts.
3. What are the special problems which each type of service requires?

When stress and strain are rife,
And harsh words would be easiest to say,
Replace taut lines of doubt or bitterness,
With quiet threads of thoughtful understanding.

"Of the Dust"

Low, out of the dust atoms of lost cities,
Low, out of the dust the gentle, obedient men.
Thus in leaping tongues of flame old rebellions, passions, fires and the slain children.
Low, out of the dust he old kings, Jabin broken with years
From his tower. Gleaming on the city wall.
Weled from without and within, yet valiant.
Cry from the dust lost and heroic people, Holy men and evil...
Trumpet me to repentance and believing.
And on this golden morning
Shining on the land that once held him.
Pierce me with the sweetness
Behind him thorns and he shadowed cross,
And the rising on the third day...

Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also must bring...
Torments of darkness, hundreds of destructions,
And then the still small voice And the descending Son.
Hark, dark and lovely children of those who once saw him here...
Have kept in your legends
The eternal promise...

Help me to lift up my eyes to know  
That as he once stood here, so  
Shall he come again.  
Speak low, dust of Joseph,  
Build your words of his love,  
Speak to the children of all  
Of another day.  
Whisper, whisper out of the dust.
