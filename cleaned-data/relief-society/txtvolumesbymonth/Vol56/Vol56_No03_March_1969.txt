SPARROW'S WORTH  
I know that thou art mindful of each sparrow's fall and yet can guide a nation's destiny, then still be ready for answering a call from one who is in need of help like me. I feel secure in thy awareness of my needs and that I have been taught the power of prayer. I do not know of faith the size of mustard seeds; my faith is larger than my heart can bear. My faith is not the kind to be described by size, nor yet the sort dependent on a sign; it is root-deep in knowledge, Lord, that thou art wise and that thy will be done, thy will, not mine. I feel a kinship with each falling bird, I know my sparrow's worth of need is heard.

Having lost our first little baby, my wife and I were very touched by the poem "David" (by Udora Morris, December 1968). We felt that we could empathize quite strongly with "David's" parents, and so we were grateful for your having printed the poem.

Dear Relief Society Magazine: It is with regret and tears that I must say goodbye. My sight is so bad and no repairs can be given it, so I cannot read you anymore. For thirty years and more I have enjoyed you, but now I am unable to read the wonderful stories and articles. Goodbye Magazine. I hate so to see you go. I am eighty-four years old—and can see to get around but cannot see to read.  
Mrs. Amy Bennett, Downey, Idaho  

(Editor's note: Sister Bennett's letter has been referred to the Church department for the Sightless and she is now receiving the "New Messenger Talking Book Magazine," and the Relief Society Lessons and Gospel Doctrine Lessons on records.)  

The article written by Mae R. Winters in the November 1968 Magazine ("The Apron") recalled so many happy memories of the past and brought tears to my eyes as I pictured my mother Mary Jane Doney Lowe, truly a great pioneer, performing the very same tasks with her dear aprons. Thank you, Sister Winters, for bringing back those precious memories so beautifully written.  
I do love and appreciate our inspired Magazine. It has been in my home for more than half a century.

I was tickled pink when I picked up my December Relief Society Magazine and saw the article "Candy Animals—A Family Tradition." For almost six years my family and I have been making lollipops—the year around, using six different molds of cast aluminum. We have been using almost the same recipe as the one in the Magazine, using half a batch at a time to fill these six molds. Each mold has three cavities, allowing us to make eighteen lollipops at a time. We had just about given up on finding any molds after looking for years, and then we found them in Minnesota. These molds are so inexpensive almost anyone could afford at least one. The reindeer, Santas, and Christmas trees are ideal for Christmas. There is a turkey, a chicken, and a rooster for the rest of the year. Lollipop sticks, special flavoring and colorings may also be purchased through the company. The molds are $1.65—and you can have them to hand down to your children. A catalogue may be purchased for 25c.

During the last few months, since I have been on my mission, I have found the true beauty of the messages in The Relief Society Magazine. Periodically we receive copies of the Magazine to pass on to investigators—and always read it from cover to cover.

I would like to express my appreciation to Mrs. Berg of Heber City, Utah, for having The Relief Society Magazine sent to me, as I am not a member of the Church. The many articles and stories make most interesting reading to me and my Irish friends to whom I pass my Magazines along.

Relief Society in The Welfare Plan Elder Henry D. Taylor Assistant to the Council of the Twelve

It is an honor, sisters, to be invited to participate in this very important meeting here today. I have been asked to speak on some of the cardinal principles of the Welfare Plan. One of my major assignments as a General Authority, and one that brings me extreme personal satisfaction, is to be associated in the Welfare Program of the Church. This program has attracted much favorable publicity, and many have praised the members for their earnest and sincere desire to stand on their own feet, make their own way, and to care for each other without calling on public assistance.

Welfare principles are not new. From its very organization in 1830, the Church has:
1. Encouraged members to establish and maintain their economic independence.
2. Encouraged habits of thrift and avoiding debt.
3. Fostered the establishment of employment-creating industries.
4. Stood ready at all times to help needy, faithful members.

From the very beginning, the Lord has had great concern for the poor and has expressed this concern in the following words: "I, the Lord, stretched out the heavens, and built the earth, my very handiwork; and all things therein are mine. And it is my purpose to provide for my saints, for all things are mine. But it must needs be done in mine own way." (D&C 104:14-16.) (Italics added.)

As you read the Old Testament, the New Testament, the Doctrine and Covenants, and other Church works, you will discover that there is one theme which runs consistently through all of those scriptures, and that is, "remember the poor." The care of the poor and the needy was of special concern to Christ when he was here upon the earth. The scriptures voice the sentiment and doctrine that it is the duty of those who have to give. To those who are in want, and great blessings shall come to those who obey this law.

The early 1930's were dark days that tried men's souls. A deep economic depression had spread over the country. Fortunes were wiped out. Men of wealth became poverty stricken. Factories and businesses were closed. There was widespread unemployment. Bread lines formed, and there was want, hunger, and despair throughout the land.

In the wards and stakes of the Church, bishoprics and stake presidencies were doing everything possible to care for their members. The First Presidency was greatly concerned with this grave condition, and in 1933 sent a questionnaire to the Relief Society in The Welfare Plan wards to determine the resources in the hands of the bishops to care for their people. By 1936, after prayerful consideration, a plan had been formulated; and in the April General Conference, the First Presidency called for renewed emphasis upon the welfare phase of the gospel, and the Welfare Plan was announced.

In introducing the plan, the First Presidency explained the reason for its establishment in the following words: "Our primary purpose," said the First Presidency, "was to set up, in so far as it might be possible, a system under which the curse of idleness would be done away with, the evils of a dole abolished, and independence, industry, thrift, and self-respect be once more established amongst our people. The aim of the Church is to help the people to help themselves. Work is to be re-enthroned as the ruling principle of the lives of our Church membership." (Welfare Plan Handbook, page 1.)

It will be observed that idleness is denounced and work glorified in this statement. Our forefather Adam received the pronouncement from the Lord, "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground." (Genesis 3:19.) Again, the Lord said to the Church on February 9, 1831: "Thou shalt not be idle; for he that is idle shall not eat the bread nor wear the garments of the laborer." (D&C 42:42.) Thus, it is made plain that the Lord expects man to work. Church members should, therefore, be self-sustaining to the extent of their own powers. No true Latter-day Saint will, while physically able, voluntarily shift from himself to others the burden of his own support. So long as he can, under the inspiration of the Almighty, and with his own strength and labor, he will supply himself with the necessities of life.

A Church member who is unable to provide for himself should then look to his relatives for assistance. No person should become a charge upon the public welfare or the Church as long as his relatives are able to care for him. All Church members should accept the responsibility, insofar as they are able, to care for the needy among their own kin.

The Apostle Paul taught this doctrine when he stated: "But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel." (I Timothy 5:8.)

The late President Stephen L Richards aptly declared: "I think my food would choke me if I knew that while I could procure bread my aged father or mother or near kin were on public relief."

The concepts have been summarized in the following statement: "Church welfare accepts as fundamental truth the proposition that the responsibility for one's economic maintenance rests (1) upon himself, (2) upon his family, (3) upon the Church, if he is a faithful member thereof." (Welfare Plan Handbook, page 1.)

The Welfare Program stands ready to help those who cannot help themselves or who cannot obtain sufficient aid from family members, but no Latter-day Saint should anticipate that anyone, other than himself, will provide for his own needs.

What can we do to prepare ourselves to care for our own needs? I would suggest the following:
1. Obtain an adequate education; learn a trade, skill, or profession so that remunerative employment can be secured.
2. Live within our incomes. As I told you Relief Society sisters on a previous occasion: "Don't let mamma's yearnings exceed papa's earnings."
3. Avoid excessive debt. Necessary debt should be incurred only after very careful and prayerful thought, consideration, getting all the best advice that we possibly can, and keeping well within our ability to repay. We have been counseled to "Avoid debt as a plague."
4. Acquire and store a reserve of food, clothing, and cash on a sensible, well-planned basis.

In the matter of storing food, Elder Harold B. Lee has wisely counseled: "We have never laid down an exact formula for what anybody should store, and let me just make this comment: Perhaps if we think more in terms of what it would take to keep us alive in case we didn't have anything to eat, that last would be very easy to put in storage for a year... Just enough to keep us alive if we didn't have anything to eat."

We wouldn't get fat on it, but we would live; and if you think in terms of that kind of annual storage rather than a whole year's supply of everything that you're accustomed to eat, which, in most cases, is utterly impossible for the average family, I think we will come nearer to what President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., advised us way back in 1937. (See address of President Clark, Conference Report, April 1937, pp. 26-27.) The key figure in the Welfare Plan is the bishop: By word of the Lord, the sole mandate to care for and the sole discretion in caring for the poor of the Church is lodged in the bishop. It is his duty and his only to determine to whom, when, how, and how much shall be given to any member of his ward from Church funds and as ward help. Whoever and whatever the help he calls in to assist him perform his service, he is still responsible. (Welfare Plan Handbook, page 6.) Since the earliest days of the Church, the Relief Society has been and still is the bishop's chief help in administering to those in need. The Relief Society has been trained and prepared to handle certain phases of Welfare work better than any other agency. The bishop has at his disposal two major resources to carry out his responsibility in caring for the poor: Commodities generally produced on the 600 agricultural projects, and processed in canneries owned by the ward and stake members. A flour and feed mill, a coal mine, and clothing manufacturing projects are Church-owned. These commodities are used to stock the 102 bishops' storehouses, and from these, the bishops may requisition food, clothing, and other items to aid those in need. It is satisfying to note that the production budget has been filled 97.3 per cent on a Church-wide basis over the past twenty-two years. The other major resource at the disposal of the bishop is the fast offering fund. Contributions are from free-will cash offerings of members who abstain from two meals per month and pay the equivalent amount—or a more generous contribution to the bishop. He uses these funds to provide for the cash needs of welfare recipients, such as to pay rent, utilities, hospital, and medical bills. After the bishop's initial visit to the home of the needy, he will direct the Relief Society president to make a personal inspection of the home and review household needs and to let the family feel her sisterly solicitude and sustained interest in their welfare. He will indicate to her whether the family is to receive partial or full assistance. 

Relief Society in The Welfare Plan

When the Relief Society president analyzes and determines the needs, she will write out a bishop's order and return it to the bishop, for only he has the authority to sign and issue welfare orders. Your General Relief Society Presidency has outlined in detail specific recommendations and suggestions regarding these visits.

The Welfare Program is important. Caring for the poor is important. It has been stated that one of the foremost reasons for giving the financial law of the Church was so that the needy and the suffering might be cared for. It seems that this purpose had a preferential claim above all other purposes on the funds of the Church. It is understood that at one time when President Grant was instructing a stake presidency, he stated that before the Church would allow its members to suffer want, it would close every school, every seminary, and every temple.

Those physically able are urged and expected to work for the Church assistance they receive within the limits of their ability and health. The Church is strongly opposed to a dole of any kind, whether it be county, State, or Federal. (A dole to us means "receiving something and giving nothing in return.") Those receiving Church assistance are expected to work.

Brigham Young once said: My experience has taught me, and it has become a principle with me, that it is never any benefit to give out and out to man or woman, money, food, clothing, or anything else, if they are able-bodied and can work and earn what they need, when there is anything on the earth for them to do. This is my principle, and I try to act upon it. To pursue a contrary course would ruin any community in the world and make them idlers. (Discourses of Brigham Young, page 274.)

A few years ago, a man went to his bishop and practically demanded that the Church aid and assist him. The man was ninety-five per cent blind and used a white cane in his walking. He was thoroughly convinced that he was not able to earn a living. The bishop explained to him that if he were to receive assistance from the Church, he would have to earn that help. The man was most indignant to think that the bishop was so shortsighted and unsympathetic as to feel that he had to labor and earn what he was to receive. However, the bishop insisted, and the man responded.

The bishop personally took him to Welfare Square. He was assigned to label cans. The first few days and weeks were difficult. But, gradually, the young man gained more speed and skill, and, within a month's time, he was the fastest, neatest can labeler in the whole cannery. One day he came to the bishop and said if he could label cans this well and do a few other things which he had been taught, he surely ought to be able to take some training at the Blind Center. The bishop helped the young man and his mother during the time that the boy was in the school for the blind. At the conclusion of the course, the bishop assisted him in securing a job—a fine position. From that time on, he has been able to work and to support himself fully, and his mother, and has required no financial assistance from the Church or others.

Generally speaking, the Welfare Plan is regarded as a temporal program caring for the physical needs of the people, but the great spiritual aspects of the program should never be overlooked. To the Lord, all things are spiritual, for he has said: Wherefore, verily I say unto you that all things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal.... (D&C 29:24.)

In a talk given by President McKay, then a Counselor to President Grant, just six months after the announcement of the Welfare Plan in 1936, some prophetic utterances were made when President McKay said: I do not know of any activity with which we have been associated which promises more fruitful results in temporal and spiritual achievement than this Church Security Program. It is going to stand out in the Church history as significant... After all is said and done, the greatest blessings that will accrue from the Church Security Plan are spiritual.

Outwardly, every act seems to be directed toward the _ physical: re-making of dresses and suits of clothes, canning fruits and vegetables, storing foodstuffs, choosing fertile fields for settlement— all seem strictly temporal, but permeating all of these acts, inspiring and sanctifying them, is the element of spirituality. (Conference Report, October 1936, page 103.) The program is spiritual, but it is difficult to build a person up spiritually when he is physically cold and hungry. The temporal needs must first be met, and then spiritual blessings may follow. Although members of the Church contribute their time and their means, there should be more to it than that. There must be a sharing, and with their contributions should go their prayers, good wishes, a brotherly and sisterly concern, interest, and love. During 1967, some 46,519 of you good women of the Church assisted on various welfare projects—doing a temporal work to bring both temporal and spiritual blessings to others, and, incidentally, to yourselves, because of your unselfish participation. You sisters can give encouragement, sympathy, and inspiration where needed, and, certainly, can be responsible for a great spiritual uplift in the lives of those needing assistance. My dear sisters, the Welfare Program is not on trial. The foundation is firmly laid; it is well established and has been in operation for over thirty-two years. The basic concepts have been tested and proved to be sound. We know the road that we should travel. The Welfare Program is here to stay. Elder Harold B. Lee, who for a quarter of a century served as managing director of the General Church Welfare Committee, and who was associated with the program from its very beginning, has made this observation in reference to the permanency of the Welfare Plan: "This program will last as long as this Church exists as a Church." Shortly after the Church was organized, the Lord gave to the saints what might be considered the "perfect economic system." This was the law known as the United Order. For a variety of reasons, the saints were not able to live this law; and later tithing was given as a substitute law. We look forward to the time when we may again have the Relief Society in The Welfare Plan privilege of living the United Order. The First Presidency has made this prediction: "The United Order will be established by the Lord in his own due time and in accordance with the regular prescribed order of the Church." In the meantime, though, I have this assurance—the Welfare Program is a training field which will prepare us for that brighter day when we may again have the blessing of having the United Order. A statement from one of the brethren on this is instructive. He said: It is not asserted that the Welfare Plan is the United Order, but perhaps there is a much greater nearness of approach than we have been accustomed to think. Safe it is to say that a complete living of the law governing this plan, and the practice of the principles involved, would make the transition into the organization of the United Order not too difficult. (Albert E. Bowen, The Church Welfare Plan.) It is my strong and abiding testimony that the Welfare Program was instituted under the inspiration of our Heavenly Father, and that President Grant, through inspiration and revelation from the Holy Ghost, did set up this Welfare Plan. It is not something that was just thought up over night, and, being an inspired program, it will not fail. The Lord has declared that it is his purpose to provide for his saints, but it must needs be done in his own way. It is my firm conviction that the Welfare Plan is the Lord's way today of caring for his people, to which I testify in the name of the Lord, Jesus Christ. Amen.

169 "The Salt of the Earth"

Perhaps one of the greatest of all recorded discourses is that known to us as "The Sermon on the Mount" given by the Savior to his disciples and devoted adherents who followed him to a mountain near the Sea of Galilee in order that they might hear more of his teachings. These were people who had been attracted by the power of his matchless words and by the miracles he had performed. They felt constrained to forsake their all, and follow after him. In this great sermon, the Savior declared he had not come to destroy the law (the law of Moses) but to fulfill it. He taught the higher law—the law of love, "... Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you." (Matthew 5:44.) The beginning of The Sermon on the Mount sets forth the very essence of true religion and its attendant blessing. Then, in a mode of direct personal address, the Savior pronounced those disciples who sat listening to be the worthy benefactors of mankind when he declared: "Ye are the salt of the earth" (Matthew 5:13.) This is an interesting analogy. Salt is the great preservative. It prevents deterioration and spoilage. It freshens and sweetens. It serves as a corrective—a purifier. It brings out flavor and gives pungency. In using this analogy, the Savior made clear that the small band of righteous disciples would be as a condiment that would arrest corruption, purify mankind, and bring desirable flavor to earth life. Along with this pronouncement, however, the Savior sounded a warning note as he continued, "but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it [the earth] be salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out" (Matthew 5:13.) With this warning, the Savior demonstrated his recognition of the tendency of man, including the so-called righteous, to lose his saline or purifying qualities. He raised the pertinent question as to how, then, corruption should be stamped out, and the earth be purified. Thus he emphasized the urgency of his disciples' remaining steadfast.

Through the years, the term "the salt of the earth," has been appropriately applied to individuals and to groups whose character, purity, and nobility of life have served as leaven to inspire, uplift, and benefit others; those whose characters are above reproach, and whose acts are prompted by the most righteous of motives. Often I find myself applying the term, "the salt of the earth," to the great body of women who are Relief Society visiting teachers. Righteous in their lives, faithful in service, more than 132,000 sisters now go forth month after month in fair weather or foul, in their office and calling as representatives of Relief Society to uplift, to bless, and to exercise sisterly watchcare over the mothers and homemakers of the Church. Theirs is not an easy assignment. It involves conscientious study, prayer, countless hours of time, unselfish effort, and the strict regulation of their individual lives in order that they more fully may meet the requirements of the calling. Regardless of the demands made of them, however, these sisters go forth devotedly on their mission of love and mercy.

Many sisters have done so year after year; in some instances for a period of time that is almost comparable to the generally allotted span of life. During the past year, I attended a stake visiting teacher convention. Seated on the front row were some of the most angelic-looking women one might ever expect to see. They ranged in age from twenty-three to ninety-two years. All were visiting teachers who were being honored for their service. They had served in this calling from three to sixty-four years, respectively. I thought, how unlimited has been the good these sisters have accomplished. Could it have been precisely measured and then compiled with the records of tens of thousands of others who likewise have served, what an overwhelming account of righteous accomplishment would be revealed! These sisters, however, do not give this service out of a desire to make a record, or for personal recognition or credit. Such motives would not lead to the achievement of the worthy purposes for which the visiting teacher program is designed. What, then, does prompt them to so serve? May I suggest one or two of the major reasons: 1. Respect for Church calling. 2. The spirit of the gospel which animates their lives. 3. The compassionate nature of the work which is according to the nature of women. 4. The genuine need for such a program. While it is true that the great bulk of visiting teachers give continuously dependable and qualified service, we must recognize that there are times when, with some of the sisters, enthusiasm declines and effort grows lax; when, indeed, "The salt begins to lose its savour." At such a time, we remind ourselves of the words of the Savior spoken to his disciples, "if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted?" (Matthew 5:13). So the wise Relief Society president is alert for evidences of this. She asks herself, "What are its evidences, and how may they best be dealt with?" We suggest a few of the evidences as follows: Declining enthusiasm for the work; the attitude that it is merely a routine duty to be performed or a favor conferred upon or concession made to the presidency; irregularity in attendance at visiting teacher meetings, and even in making visits; a shift in the compelling motive of the visit from rendering a needed and qualified service to a striving for a record in number of visits made; a tiredness on the part of the teacher; even a questioning of the worth of the program. The key person in helping the visiting teacher to maintain the freshness and vitality of the service and to find joy and satisfaction in the calling is the ward Relief Society president, supported and wisely counseled by the stake Relief Society president. The General Board, too, feels concern and offers its suggestions as follows: Let there be a closeness between the word "Relief Society president" and the individual visiting teachers so that the president may be aware at the very outset of any adverse attitudes or unproductive efforts. Let her see her responsibilities in motivating the sisters to fruitful and happy effort. Let her so act in the very beginning, by following approved procedures in making the call. Let her frequently emphasize to the visiting teachers, individually and collectively, the lofty purposes of the program. Let her occasionally inquire of the visiting teachers individually as to how they are enjoying their work, thus affording them opportunity confidentially to apprise her of problems or, better still, to be strengthened by bearing testimony of their love for the calling; let her be sensitive to the relationship of compatible women who more or less complement one another, being assigned to serve as companions, and the general success of the visit. Upon occasion, it may be wise for the president to consider the desirability of a change in district assignments. Let her be quick to acknowledge individual as well as collective accomplishments, and to express appreciation for the devotion and the quality of work that brought this about. Let the teachers feel her personal faith and confidence in them, and her competence in dealing with the work because of her broad knowledge and understanding of the program and her strong personal conviction of its worthiness and the divinity that guides it. As we consider the type of women who make up the visiting teaching group (more than 139,000 of them), as we contemplate the motives which led them to make approximately 5,000,000 visits last year, as we ponder the uplift and comfort that has been brought into Latter-day Saint homes through their service, as we consider the gospel principles they have taught through precept and example, as we take into account the hands that have been strengthened and the homes that have been blessed, it does not seem inappropriate to refer to the visiting teachers as "The salt of the earth." So important, however, is the program that at no time or under any circumstance should those of us who are in charge of the work allow the salt to lose its savor because of laxity on our own parts. We bear in mind always that the important factor in helping any sister to maintain the savor in any Relief Society calling is to keep her testimony live and growing. Active participation in all aspects of Relief Society work is the open doorway to this.

Who am I?
Only my Heavenly Father knows,
For he created my spirit, and knew my intelligence.
What am I?
Again, he alone knows, now;
But he desires that I learn
To comprehend myself.
This requires eternity.
I could become a unique source
Of infinite responses to truth.
Why am I?
A prism needed
Through which truly may shine
In numberless hues,
That beauty and joy may be embodied.

"What Wilt Thou Have Me to Do?"
Afton W. Hunt
Member, General Board of Relief Society

It is recorded that, at one time, an individual had the opportunity to ask of the Lord Jesus Christ, this question, "What wilt thou have me to do?" The answer given to Saul was neither complicated nor difficult to understand. He was told to go to the city of Damascus where he would be shown that which he should do. The great overall rewards from Saul's obedience to these simple instructions in his new-found faith, resulted in immeasurable service to God, to mankind, and to himself.

What shall we do with our lives?
We who daily face crisis and frustration in the conflict between sin and righteousness, and whose families must be strengthened for an unpredictable future.

We, too, would ask, "What wilt thou have me to do?" [Address Delivered at the In essence is not this the question presented to the Prophet Relief Society Annual General Joseph Smith by the women of Conference, October 2, 1988] Nauvoo when they consulted him concerning their desire to be of greater service in the gospel effort? His answer to them was neither complicated nor difficult to understand, but it made plain our Heavenly Father's plan for the service, progress, and purposeful living of his daughters. With inspired vision, he organized the sisters that their efforts for service would be combined with opportunities for mental and spiritual growth, and provide ways and means whereby they could equip themselves to meet life's challenges in every age. Through obedience to this great plan, the accomplishments of Relief Society as an organization stand in first place among those of organized women of the world; so much so that those unacquainted with Relief Society, and the capabilities of its active individual members, are amazed in learning of it. An example of this is an experience of the cultural refinement class leader of my own ward Relief Society when she traveled with her medical doctor husband on a professional trip to a California hospital. As was her practice, she took with her the Relief Society textbook to study while she waited for him. And so it was that she happened to be in a California hospital waiting room reading Out of The Best Books, Volume 3, when she became aware of being closely observed by a refined appearing woman sitting across the table from her. At length the woman spoke to her saying, "Excuse me, please, but I see by the title of your book that you evidently belong to a literary study group." Our class leader replied that she did, and that the group was the women's organization of the Church to which she belonged. It seemed to surprise the woman to hear that a Church group studied literature, or anything other than theology. So our sister had the opportunity to explain to her the extensive educational and service program of Relief Society. On hearing of its variety, and broadness of scope of the studies and activities, the woman's reaction was one of amazement. Could it be that we who are so close to and engaged in our Heavenly Father's program for us, accept it as an ordinary privilege and fail to associate this blessing with its inspired source? Do our neighbors and friends recognize, through us, Relief Society's proffered opportunities? In every stake in the Church there are Latter-day Saint sisters, as well as those not of our faith, who are not yet acquainted with the strengthening influence of Relief Society. Are we using every opportunity to demonstrate its constructive force in our own lives? It has been said that the only Bible some people read is the example they see in the lives of others. As Relief Society sisters, even our small acts speak with power to those who are reading our lives. Evidence of the potency of Relief Society in lifting standards and accomplishments to the point of influencing others through example was recently brought to my attention. A woman from Australia applied at the Church Information Center for assistance in learning about so-called "Mormonism." She explained that she knew nothing about the Church but that she had a friend in Australia who, as she said, "joined the Mormons," and that she also belonged to "their women's organization." She reported that in a very short time it had completely remade the friend and changed her focus in life, that she had almost reversed her former practices and attitudes toward people. Most important of all, she now seemed to be enjoying a happiness one seldom sees in life. The visitor explained that while touring the United States, she had made special effort to come to Salt Lake City to learn the truth about such an organization. It is stimulating to know that the pattern and directives given to Relief Society sisters through the years are as applicable today in preparing us to meet the challenges of modern living as they have been throughout our history. How grateful we should be for this magnificent blessing that is ours to share. It gives us opportunity to light our spiritual candles every day as we live, that en masse we may become a light-house to those who are searching for truth. May we so pattern our lives that they will be a visible answer to every woman who is mentally asking, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" 

Aio THE SEAMSTRESS I have been sewing all these many years, It's queer how fast the seasons go, Still, sewing is just an avocation Wedged in between the other loves, you know. Between the summer's canning and the children's time, Between the constant meals—a little dress; On birthday party days the sewing room was locked Against the danger of my eagerness. For always there were times a child would come Seeking some fellowship—unnamable to say— Nothing particular—but needing something said =e. About his own well-being or some praise that day., 7. For hunger must be met in children's hearts And leisure hours be theirs to feel, Making a child know he's loved and special "A sort of stitching just for heart appeal. > And now, that all those things are gone, I think I do distinguish there More sowing than sewing, | guess you'd say, Yet, as a seamstress | was more than fair.

(John 3:5.) At the end of his earthly ministry, he placed the greatest possible stamp of authoritativeness on what he had taught and exemplified by giving up his life, not only to provide the basic requisite—victory over death—but to open the way to eternal membership in his Father's heavenly kingdom to all who have the desire and the will to attain to it. This is his Church—and through his prophets he has continued to emphasize the great joy and rewards that come through following the path he has charted. His greatest work was to offer and make possible salvation for others. The same is the responsibility of his Church—and its members. A brief study of the counsel given to us by all of our latter-day prophets will show how great this responsibility is on our part. The terms—"necessary," "essential," "greatest responsibility that God has placed upon us," "important duty," "great work," "absolutely necessary," "under condemnation" (if we do not), "cannot" (obtain the blessings)—are repeatedly found among the inspired spoken and written counsel that has been given to us in regard to temple work. The Prophet Joseph Smith used the following in his enlightening King Follett funeral sermon: hence the responsibility—the awful responsibility—that rests upon us in relation to our dead; for all of the spirits who have not obeyed the gospel in the flesh must either obey it in the spirit or be damned. Would that I had forty days and nights in which to tell you all. (DHC, Volume VI, pp. 312-313.) These things apply not only to all persons as individuals, but also to the continuance of family relationships. It is an inherent desire in the hearts of almost all people that their family relationships continue after they leave this life. So strong was this desire in the hearts of the parents of a young engaged couple who were killed in a recent automobile accident in the State of New York, that they arranged for the couple to be "symbolically married" before being buried side by side. The "keys of salvation" as administered in the house of the Lord are just what the term implies—keys—and there can be no opening of the door to the kingdom of God without them. We hold these keys which alone can open the door for our ancestors—for all the dead who died without a knowledge of them. They do not have them—they cannot get them—except through us, the living. A significant step is being taken under the inspired guidance of our Church leaders in the implementation of the GIANT (Genealogical Information and Name Tabulation) program which makes use of modern electronic techniques to process names for temple ordinance work. For more than ninety years, the diligent efforts of faithful members of the Church have provided many millions of departed spirits with the ordinances of salvation. By plodding research and manual methods of recording and submitting names, they have done a marvelous work. But as time and inspired ingenuity frequently change and improve upon what has gone before, so we must be willing to use advancing technology to assist in speeding up the work of salvation. We are told that the major activity of the people who dwell on the earth during the thousand-year millennial period will be temple work. Our leaders have repeatedly spoken of the time when thousands of temples will be dedicated to the work of salvation, in all parts of the world. (Prophet Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, Wilford Woodruff, and others, quoted in Latter-day Prophets Speak, Ludlow, pp. 130-136.) Known records of identifiable persons do not extend back much beyond 600 years, and, for most countries, much less than that. It is the responsibility of the members of the Church not only to find and provide the saving ordinances for these people who have died without a knowledge of the gospel, but to keep a record of all the ordinances that are performed. As the work increases and continues on into the millennial era, these record files will grow to vast proportions. The use of modern storage and retrieval techniques under the GIANT system will provide the necessary growth potential to take care of these filing needs. How long will it be before the temple ordinances for these persons will be completed? And beyond that? Doubt not—when records are no longer extant for extending ancestral pedigrees and linking generation to generation—that the Lord, in his great wisdom, will provide a way for accomplishing that which he commands. President Wilford Woodruff stated that the work will continue until the entire human race who merit a place in the family of Adam's posterity has been sealed. Only then can the Mediator between man and his God proclaim, "It is finished." (Wilford Woodruff as quoted in Latter-day Prophets Speak, page 133.)

EDITORIAL

The sweet, pleasing, harmonious sound of music, expressing the ideals, beliefs, and emotions of Relief Society sisters, has been heard in Relief Society meetings since that first meeting in Nauvoo when the Society was organized by the Prophet Joseph Smith. The minutes of the founding meeting record that the meeting commenced with singing "The Spirit of God Like a Fire Is Burning" and closed with "Come Let Us Rejoice in the Day of Salvation." How could the feelings of the sisters on that momentous occasion have been expressed more fervently; what could they have done that would have revealed their gratitude to the Lord in a way more pleasing to him than through song, for the Lord declared, "For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me" (D&C, 25-12)? Throughout its history, Relief Society has encouraged congregational and choral singing. It has urged mothers to see that children with talent are given training. It has encouraged music in the home because of its importance to the spiritual and cultural well-being of the home and family. Relief Society women have responded to the encouragement given and have shown joyful interest in the singing opportunities afforded them by Relief Society. Congregational singing, led by able choristers, has enriched Relief Society meetings and brought meaningful enjoyment to members.

Choral music in Relief Society has had an interesting history, and countless women have been brought into the Society as active members through the choral music program. Many non-Church members have joined Relief Society to sing in the chorus and have found it an open door to Church membership. Typical of the stake choruses in earlier days was the Salt Lake Stake Chorus, conducted by Agnes Olson Thomas. In an interview at her home in Salt Lake City in April 1942, Agnes Thomas said, "I was selected to the office of Relief Society chorister in the old Salt Lake Stake; I think it was in 1916, and I served for sixteen years. Our choir numbered about thirty-five, and we sang in the Assembly Hall at the stake conferences, and always had a program for Annual Day, and often sang at the monthly meetings. We had pleasant times." 

In 1914, Lizzie Thomas Edward, a brilliant soprano and musical director for the General Board, was selected by the General Board as chorister of a Central Relief Society Choir of selected voices. For a number of years this choir rendered many fine anthems and hymns at the general conferences of Relief Society. In April 1932, the Liberty Stake Chorus of selected voices from the several wards of that stake, directed by Charlotte O. Sackett, furnished music at the Relief Society General Conference. After this successful appearance, the chorus was sponsored by the Anna B. Hart Anne R. Gledhill Edith S. Elliott Belva B. Ashton Florence J. Madsen Zola J. McGhie Leone G. Layton Oa J. Cannon Blanche B. Stoddard Aleine M. Young Alberta H. Christensen Mildred B. Eyring Edith P. Backman Winniefred S. Manwaring Elna P. Haymond Mary R. Young Afton W. Hunt Elsa T. Peterson Fanny S.

Brown Reba C. Aldous Luella W. Finlinson Norma B. Ashton Mayola R. Miltenberger Maurine M. Haycock General Board, more singers were added from the Salt Lake stakes, and Mrs. Sackett was appointed director. This group, consisting of 250 mothers, furnished the music for the April Conference, 1933, appearing under the name of "Singing Mothers." 

In 1940 the central chorus of Relief Society Singing Mothers was released by the General Board in order to strengthen Relief Society choruses in the wards and stakes of Salt Lake City from which the central chorus of Singing Mothers had been drawn. Since that time, music for each general session of the Relief Society General Conference has been provided by a combined stake Singing Mothers Chorus made up of selected singers from the respective stakes. Such combined choruses come from various areas of the Church. The wisdom of the General Board in disbanding the central chorus in favor of promoting local choruses is reflected in the growth in the number and size of Relief Society Singing Mothers choruses throughout the Church. Today there are 3,612 Singing Mothers choruses, with more than 51,496 women participating. The General Board pays tribute to the outstanding choristers, both local and General Board, who, with skill and devotion, have used their talents to help develop choruses that have attracted wide attention and much favorable comment from competent judges, and contributed significantly to the growth and accomplishments of the Society. We acknowledge with gratitude the work of the talented accompanists and the instrumentalists whose work is so important in the success of a chorus. We acknowledge with appreciation the invitations extended by distinguished special musical programs.

In today's world where spiritual and cultural activities are so greatly needed, when the home needs the joyous uplift of good music, when mothers need the solace of song as they contend with the problems of life, Relief Society must press forward with its glorious program of congregational and choral singing. This we know will be pleasing unto the Lord.

To press my lips, upon a fair cheek or a brown,
Of my three sons, so long I have stooped down.
But suddenly today to my surprise,
I find that I must lift my eyes,
To meet their eyes;
That I must stand on toe tips,
And reach up to kiss their lips.
These tall young sons, THOMAS, each straight as any pine—
HAROLD, can they be mine?
AND RICHARD soon I must share them,
Soon I know that they will go.
But oh, I am so happy;
That I have had,
Three small sons to stoop to,
Three tall sons to reach to,
Clean sons to give,
That others may live.

183 Mission Of The American Red Cross
Emil E. Henderson @ The American Red Cross is the instrument chosen by the Congress to help carry out the obligations assumed by the United States under certain international treaties known as the Geneva or Red Cross Conventions. Specifically, its Congressional charter imposes on the American Red Cross the duties to act as the medium of voluntary relief and communication between the American people and their armed forces, and to carry on a system of national and international relief to prevent and mitigate suffering caused by disasters.

All the activities of the American Red Cross and its chapters support these duties. The accomplishment of its mission of health and welfare services at United States military installations in this Country and overseas and to the civilian population across the Nation is a task of great magnitude. Its success depends on the participation and involvement of thousands of volunteers enthusiastically willing to share their time and their talents in the service of others.

There is further dependence upon the generosity of those who contribute of their means to finance these humanitarian programs. Services offered by the Red Cross are many and all are dedicated to the health, safety, and peace of mind of people. Whether it be a Home Nursing course offered through cooperative efforts of Red Cross and the Relief Society—emergency action on behalf of a serviceman in Viet Nam—disaster aid to flood victims along the Mississippi—rescue of a drowning child and the administration of First Aid—blood supply in hospitals across the land—services to patients in hospitals by kindly volunteers—or food for the starving children in far away Biafra—every single effort is guided toward giving the ill more opportunity to regain health, the homeless a place of abode, and the discouraged hope for the future.

The Red Cross, as much as any organization on the American scene, has erased from the public mind the image of volunteers as serene dispensers of charity. Serene they may be, but they are workers. They do big jobs and small ones; they handle unpleasant tasks as well as pleasant ones. They bring skill and efficiency to their efforts along with understanding and compassion.

They come in all ages, sizes, and colors, bound together by one primary motivation—the desire to serve their neighbors.

In a recent statement, Mr. E. Roland Harriman, National Chairman, said, "The Red Cross is unquestionably the largest volunteer organization in the country, and in the volunteer spirit lies the Nation's greatest strength."

184 "A Gift of Love"
Addie Belknap Pierson @ Helen.
The first time I saw Helen was the day we moved into our first "real" home. She came over to borrow the proverbial cup of sugar, welcome us, and help. And help she did.

We were very new to the area; it was Jeff's first job after college. Between commencement day at his school and the commencement of his working days, we had had three days. All used in traveling. So there I sat amid boxes, barrels, and dirt that first morning. I was going over my agenda for the day—I was a modern organized house engineer—and had listed:

1. Make bed (the only thing we had unpacked the night before).
2. Clear away breakfast things (sweet roll wrappings and milk carton).
3. Get dressed.
4. Start unpacking.

I should have put No. 4 before No. 3, as all the clothes I had out were one traveling suit and one nightgown. As I was musing over the problem, there was a loud knock, a cheery hello, and, suddenly, "Say, could I borrow some sugar?" a tall angular woman, cup in hand, smile on face, was sprawled out across my very own kitchen floor.

Wondering how the smile had stayed on, and making a mental note to find a more convenient place to keep Jeff's books on mathematical data and abstract math than in the doorway, I offered my hand to help the poor lady up. She seemed to come up at all angles, brushing herself off, but with no need for assistance.

"My name is Helen—Mom should have called me Grace—Helen Jorgenson. I live in the duplex, closest side to you folks. Say, could I borrow some sugar? Don't have it all out yet? Well, why don't I just help you unpack it and a few of your other necessaries? Howard, that's my husband, and we were glad to hear someone had rented this place. With just a bit of elbow grease and water, it will be looking really pretty again. My goodness, no wonder I tripped—never was much good at arithmetic. I suppose abstract algebra has to do with arithmetic?"

The sudden silence in this running dialogue stunned me so that I could not answer, only watch as Helen stacked one box of books on the other, picked both up and walked into the hallway.

It was just as well. Evidently the silence was actually a fade-out, since I soon heard "Where do you keep your soap and water?" echoing back to me from the living room.

That's how Helen and I met. We were sort of a Mutt and Jeff team, she being about 5'10" to my 5'2". We had a difference in ages, she was thirty and I was only twenty-two.

Both our husbands were away a lot, Jeff was getting started in his chosen profession (work Helen always called it). Actually I never met Howard, her husband, for over a year. "My man is a sailorman," she told me later. "A good man but madly in love with the sea and anything that sails. We met during the war, you know. I worked in a factory near the harbor and I used to watch the ships dock. One day a bosun's mate came up. He stood in my pathway, and along comes Howard, my husband you know, just a seaman he was then, and he told the bosun to find another girl because I was taken. And I guess I have been ever since. Howard, that's my _ husband, hopes to be a Chief someday. Say, aren't you putting those ribbon ties on the wrong side?" This conversation took place over Edward Jefferson Harper the Second's wardrobe making. "That Eddie now, he's a regular little corker," was Helen's exclamation of approval over our own beautiful Edward Jefferson Harper the Second. When Eddie was three months old, Howard (Helen's husband) came home on leave. Jeff and I were very curious to meet Howard Jorgenson. We had visions of a large, blond Swedish-type sailor, with large tattoos on either arm. Even a prize fighter type. 'Howard, my husband, writes he has won the title in his weight class," she had told us once. When Helen brought him over to see "that little corker Eddie," we were both stunned speechless, as so often seems the case when we are with Helen. She is not shocking, just surprising. Anyway, there stood Howard, her husband, all 5'4" of him, and it was a good thing he was standing frontwise or we would have missed him. His boxing class was bantam weight, and he was just like a banty rooster. But how this little, quiet sailor could seem to make our large Helen feel so protected and feminine, I didn't know then. About six months later, with Howard back to sea, Helen was over watching me bathe Eddie one morning. As she sat down in the kitchen, she pulled out some beautiful pink yarn and began to knit. For such an ungainly, clumsy girl, Helen did beautiful sewing and handiwork. At last, I thought, Helen and Howard are going to be blessed with a "Now this next baby of yours," cut in Helen on my blissful thoughts for her, "will need warmer nighties and more sweaters than that big Eddie, there, needed. Winter babies are different from summer ones you know." Speechless again, I just stared. "Oh, I know all about babies except getting one, I guess," she went on. "I was the oldest in a family of nine. What are you going to name this next one? Tammy? Debbie? Vickie?" Those are all popular now." "Wait, just wait a minute!" I had to get a word in this time. "Helen, how do you know this one, whom I haven't even announced, is going to be a girl?" "Well, you need a girl. It's right and proper that you have one. This big Eddie takes after his Daddy, now you need a sweet pink and gold little baby girl to take after her mom. Your life is run right. You have everything as in a book. You had good rearing, went to college for an education, married your fellow. He is educated and has a good paying job, or profession as you call it. You have a lovely home that I've seen you fix up with bits and scraps, and yet it looks like a million dollars and you always look so—so fashionable yourself. You're a popular couple. You have everything to offer a pink and gold baby girl." "Now me, I should have had a half dozen boys, rowdy, tumbling, freckle-faced, and laughing boys—but a girl, well you know that would be ridiculous...." "Why?" I again edged in a word. "Why! That's as plain as your turned-up nose. I'm only Helen. Pioneer stock, born out of my time. I am built for hard work, and hard work I do. No man ever opens doors for me, carries my packages, or helps me change flat tires or anything. Oh, sure, Howard does when he's home, but poor Howard, a woman is a "A Gift of Love" lady no matter what she looks like to him. He doesn't see me plain as other folks do." "No! He sees you with 20/20 love and that's what's important. His vision of you." This final outburst startled all three of us, and Eddie began to cry. "Shame on you," was Helen's last word. 

By the time that beautiful pink sweater was used and all the other pink, warm nighties, socks, and bootees, Jeff and I had four beautiful, handsome, perfect little gentlemen of whom any parents would be proud. Edward Jefferson was so proud to be the leader of my little men. Michael Allen was a good boy, quiet and helpful. "Now that Mickey, he's the clever one. He will be a good businessman someday," Helen prophesied. James Joseph was going to be tall and, probably, a good ball player. "Oh, dear, did our Jimmy-Joe break another window?" she would sweetly remark. And our baby David John was sweet and gurgly. "Now, Davy Jones, my lad, when this boy catches up with his brothers, you folks are really going to have a whole houseful of rowdy, tumbling, laughing boys." "Oh, Helen! You are irrepressible and irreplaceable. But this house is already full." Now that I had the floor, I began talking in high gear. "Overflowing full! I'm afraid our little dreamhouse doesn't fit our large real life. Jeff and I have decided to look for a larger place, farther out. March 1969 Oh, Helen, I'm so excited. Jeff even says if we can't find what we want, we'll build. I have so many plans. I couldn't tell you before, but Jeff is getting another promotion, and now so many new things are happening that Jeff and I " My voice ran down rather like an old gramophone. Helen was speechless this time and white as a sheet. "Helen, what's the matter? Oh! Say now, we'll still see one another. Maybe not as often as we would like, we'll always be friends—but Helen, what is it?" "Oh, please—don't move yet for awhile, you're my only friend, my only family, really, since mine's all back East, and I'm, oh, well, I'm pregnant—that's what I am—at forty!" "Helen, you are not in old age! Now hush, don't cry, this isn't like you. Aren't you happy? Why I think its wonderful." "Happy! Certainly I'm happy, but I'm so scared. Howard will be on his last cruise before he retires. That sea is going to rob me of my one other strength when my time comes. You are my only hope. I'll be all alone with this baby—and—and I won't know what to do. I'll drop it." And again the wailing and tears started. "Helen! Helen, here now! You know I wouldn't leave you alone.

Our moving will just have to wait. After all, 've got to have my best mover on her feet." Then all 5'2" of me marched over to Howard and Helen's place to beard Howard in his den or forecastle or wherever sailors use for a hide-out on ship. Of course, when the sweet, helpful Howard answered my loud knock, I tried to muster all my organized self but all I squeaked out was, "Can't you stay home one cruise?" Since he just smiled at me as if humoring me, I finally burst out with, "How can you leave us at a time like this!" And I scurried back home. Something about Howard always unnerved me. I guess listening to Helen brag about her husband the many months while he was away made me shocked when I saw him. When Helen began knitting and sewing baby clothes (all blue) our routine settled down. Howard got his last long voyage changed to several short cruises to be able to help, as I had suggested. One night "Aunt" Helen told our boys that soon she would have a playmate for them, and, because her son would have no older brothers, they would have to help him learn to climb trees, play ball, tumble, and wrestle. Katrina Helene was born the next day. Katrina was for her Grandmother Jorgenson and Helene, well, Howard insisted on Helen, and Helen senior glamorized it a little. But this baby girl was no pink and gold baby. She was like Dresden china with beautiful silky black hair. And Helen! Why Helen became beautiful! People say that a bride is always beautiful on her wedding day. Well, a mother holding her newborn for the first time is even more beautiful. She had been all angles; now she was soft and lovely to behold. This clumsy, awkward woman had let her soul shine through. The baby was exquisite. She had Howard's small bones and features, but on her they were fine and delicate; she had her mother's dark hair and blue eyes. As a small baby she was happy and easily amused. She was never Kay or Kate—always Katrina. Even my rough boys were quiet and tried not to stumble so much around her.

"The time soon came for us to move. Howard and Helen, of course, were on hand to help. Naturally, Helen did most of the directing; none of us would let her do much actual work. Later, on one of their visits to our new dream home, I noticed Howard, Jeff, and all of our boys were doing special things for Helen. Noticing her dress, her hair, getting things for her or Katrina. When they had all gone down to the basement to put together the model ships Howard had brought the boys, Helen said, "So this is how you do it. Just be helpless and they'll help. I haven't told Howard yet, but I think he knows already. Katrina is such a blessing, but she will have to be everything. The Doctor says no more children. I really can't complain. We are so lucky to have her."

"Helen, oh my dear Helen, for whatever we're worth you have us. All six of us Harpers, lock, stock and barrel."

"That's right. I have. And I have had for ten years. Why, you've let me and Howard be in your family ever since we met. You even postponed your moving to this beautiful home. You've given me so much, I hope I can help you someday."

"A Gift of Love"

This last ten years hasn't been just a one-way street. Helen, you've given to me, too. Who kept my feet on the ground when I tried to get too high-faluting? Who helped sew all my children's clothes? Who calmed me down when Jimmy-Joe broke his collar bone and when Eddie had hiccups for two days and Davey Jones swallowed fifty-eight cents in assorted coins? Our friendship and love have been give and take all the way, and I think even I could argue with you about who got the most. You sound so solemn, as if it is a farewell address. What's going on? What are you and Howard up to?"

I demanded. "Well, uh Howard got this offer to teach in uh a private nautical school for boys and."

"Oh, no! This is too much" I laughed. "Your husband is going into a profession not a job. Oh, dear! Ha! Ha! Ha! Somewhere close around here on the West Coast, of course."

"Well its on the coast but it iss... Wellr: e."

"Mama, Mama, Auntie Helen and Uncle Howard are moving to a boat in the East. Can I go, too?"

"Me, too."

"Me, too."

"Can we, Mom?"

"Boys, of course not. You're so noisy and loud she wouldn't know what to do with you. We can visit."

My heart sank.

"Lots and lots?" asked Davey Jones.

"Lots' and lots, I hope," my voice echoed. I looked at my friend, and (Continued on page 220)

Homemaking.~ | Beauty, Utility, Charm Relief Society Annual General Conference, October 3, 1968 Myrtle R. Olson, Member, General Board of Relief Society Garden Scene (Winder Stake, Louise Free, President) As each individual entered the foyer of the Parley's Stake Center, the serenity and beauty of a garden was felt. Lovely blooming chrysanthemums, evergreens, and pyracantha bushes greeted the eye. A beautiful fountain further enhanced the atmosphere. Indeed, this gave a feeling to each sister, as Sister Celestia J. Taylor, the author of our homemaking discussions states: 'Gardens bring beauty and repose from the burdens of the day; they provide nourishment for the soul as well as for the body; they are a source of hospitality to our families and our friends." This setting created an atmosphere that would no doubt give to each sister the desire and enthusiasm to have a lovely garden of her own.

Beauty, Utility, Charm (Display Arranged by Anne R. Gledhill of the General Board of Relief Society) From the foyer one went to the entry of the cultural hall where the theme was effectively depicted: 'Homemaking Fair—Beauty, Utility, Charm." In the alcove was a cornucopia filled with many of the items which make up a fair. There were knitted articles, hand embroidery, a small quilt, an apron, a loaf of bread, canned fruit, vegetables, and other such objects. On a wall in the alcove hung a picture of our beloved prophet, President McKay, and Sister McKay depicting "Charm." A lovely bouquet of flowers brought out "Beauty." "Utility" was characterized by a dress made by one of the sisters. The lovely sign done in blue and gold, "Homemaking Fair—Beauty, Utility, Charm," also hung in the entry.

Bridal Display (Bountiful South Stake, Eulalia Butters, former President; Displays by Coy Tyson) The cultural hall was a scene of beauty as the various displays the sisters had so painstakingly prepared came into view. Many stakes and wards participated. The bridal display was "a thing of beauty" to behold.

Over five hundred white velour roses had been made by the sisters of the stake and fashioned into topiary trees to form a lovely setting for the live bride and bridesmaids. This would seem like a task most difficult to accomplish, but with ten wards in the stake, each ward was assigned to make fifty roses and this was done with enthusiasm and willingness. Each ward and each person was happy to be a part of such a 190 Homemaking Fair worthwhile project. The trees were lighted with tiny white lights to make them even more beautiful and effective. Every two hours a different lovely young bride and one or two bridesmaids appeared to complete the setting. The dresses which the brides and bridesmaids wore were made by the mothers of the bride, or someone else who loved to fashion a beautiful creation. These dresses showed that something just as lovely, if not more lovely, could be hand sewed rather than purchased. Many handmade trousseau items were displayed in beautiful old trunks that had been restored and antiqued and then lined with velvet. In the background was a wedding cake made by one of the sisters of the stake. A beautiful bouquet of cloth flowers made from dainty lace enhanced the punch table. Everything in this display made each one realize the beauty and charm of articles made by the sisters.

Christmas Beads (Parleys Stake, Mary Riley, President; Display by Valora Anderson) The Christmas beads which everyone so enjoys wearing at Christmas were attractively displayed on the tree which we see pictured. These are easily and quickly made. Materials needed: Gold or silver metallic thread, Christmas beads, crochet hook no. F, half-inch velvet ribbon, and a snap fastener. Thread enough beads on the metallic thread to complete one strand of beads and then proceed as follows: Chain 20 stitches, crochet a bead onto the thread, chain three stitches, and add another bead. Continue doing this until you have the desired length, approximately 26 inches, then crochet 20 stitches without any beads. Make as many strands as you desire, depending on how heavy you wish the beads to be (3, 6, or 9 strands). Then braid these strands together. Braiding takes up some length. Different size beads make the necklace more interesting. Finish with a small velvet bow sewed on one end and a small piece of velvet on the other end. Sew a snap fastener on the velvet ribbon to make the clasp. A purchased clasp could also be used.

Knitting (Holladay South Stake, Maurine B. Folsom, President; Display by Jane Reynolds) The old-fashioned spinning wheel used by our grandparents made a most appropriate setting for this charming knitting display. How practical yet elegant are the hand-knitted items shown: coats, dresses, sweaters, afghans, house slippers. There were knitted items for all ages, as well as for both men and women.

"Sweet" Village (Parleys Stake, Mary Riley, President; Castle made by Florence Halliday) The Sugar Castle enchanted all who viewed it. This was made with a cardboard box as the base. The spires were made from cardboard cylinders and topped with ice cream cones. The inside of the box was lined with colored paper and the outside frosted. The frosting was stippled. Candy decorations were also used to make this more attractive.

To make the frosting use: 2 egg whites, 1 lb. Powdered sugar, 1/4 to 1 tsp. Cream of tartar. Mix these ingredients together and beat well. If the mixture is too stiff, add a small amount of water. By using ingenuity a beautiful castle may be created by anyone.

Men's and Boys' Apparel (Valley View Stake, Madeleine Bacon, President) Not very often do we see a display made up entirely of men's and boys' apparel. The autumn leaves enhanced this display. Men's and boys' sweaters were, of course, featured, but there were also attractive suits for boys, and even a suit made for a man which was expertly tailored. A suede vest had been made which anyone would be proud to wear. This proves that if the need arises the sisters would be able to do sewing for men and boys, as well as for girls and women.

191 March 1969 Southwest Indian Mission, and Tongan Displays (Jeanette D. Tingey, Supervisor, Southwest Indian Mission; Display by Bess Ericksen; Supervisor Tongan Mission Relief Society, Jean S. Groberg) How proud we are of our Lamanite and Tongan sisters and the beautiful items which they displayed for us. In the Lamanite display were beautiful quilts, rugs, turquoise jewelry, hand-woven baskets and attractive pottery items. The Tongan sisters displayed place mats, woven slippers, purses made from shells, baskets, a toy elephant woven from straw. There were also items carved from wood.

Modern Quilt (Roy Stake, Kathleen J. Dunbar, President) There was displayed a quilt with a modern, unusual design. How it would please a young person with its lovely colors and the attractive appliqued design of butterflies and flowers.

"Vegetable People" (Craig Stake, Gwen N. Seeley, President) As the vegetable display was viewed, one was made to realize that something attractive can be made from almost nothing. Faces and hair and also hats were put on various shapes of potatoes and squash to make them attractive. One had to look very closely to realize they were vegetables. The top of the display was composed of such items as radish roses, carrot curls, celery strips, and green peppers cut in various shapes.

Beaded Jars (Holladay South Stake, Maurine B. Folsom, President; Jars made by Helen Peters) The apothecary jars and snifter pictured were made very elegant with a covering of metallic thread and pearls. To cover the snifter requires the following materials: approximately 100 pearl beads, snifter (approximately 3-1/2 inches high), 1 spool metallic elastic yarn, diameter base 3-1/4 inches, diameter top, No. 3 steel crochet hook 2 inches.

Instructions: String beads onto elastic yarn, Ch. 12 and join. Ist row 12 S. C. 2d row Ch. 2-S. C.-Ch. 3 until there are 12 spaces 3d row Ch. 3-S. C. In 2d Ch.

In each Ch, complete row 14th row repeat 13th row 6 times more 21st row slip st. Around and end Stretch and pull over glass.

Social Table (Bountiful Stake, Nora A. Stahle, President; Arlene Egan, Bountiful Eighteenth Ward) The social table would be most attractive for any Relief Society function. The sunflower in the center of the bouquet adds a gay note to the table. Individual loaves of bread on cutting boards are at each place. Red and white checked napkins also add charm to this setting.

Heslop ave @ Get your imagination working and let's make a rug. A rug, you say? Well, where do we begin? Let's begin by deciding where we need a throw rug, and the design which will be used. Now for the materials. You will need: e a piece of plywood, the size of the rug being made e carpet samples e a piece of plastic to put over the plywood e paint brush e light-weight denim or unbleached muslin e razor blade e patterns of designs to be made from carpet samples e band-aid for e water-proof adhesive recommended by a carpet dealer (latex) protecting fingers Put the plywood on the kitchen table. Cover it with plastic and tack the denim on. Denim should be about one inch larger than the rug is planned to be. This will be turned under and cemented for an edging. Mark your design on the back side of the carpet samples. Designs may be original drawings, commercial patterns, or they may be enlargements made from pictures in children's books. Cut the designs in the carpets with a razor blade. Paint the back side of design pieces with adhesive and lay them on the denim. Place the rug pieces as close together as possible, filling in the spaces around the design with pieces of a different kind of carpet sample. Light-weighting for ten minutes, until latex sets, will make a better rug. (I use a portable sewing machine as a weight and move it around as I work.) When all of the pieces are in place, turn the rug over and cement down the one inch edging. Let the rug dry, and, if desired, apply some decorative fringe or tassels with rug cement. How about another rug? A flowered one for Kathleen's and Kimberly's room, a striped one for the hall, a hexagon design for Gayle's room, a clown for Kevin's room? 204 Forsythia Spring Blossoms Defy The Winter Snow m Although springtime seems to arrive later and later each year, certain lovely blossoms defy the winds and snow, and, sometime in March in some areas of the Northern Hemisphere, their pretty blossoms offer hope for the new and welcome season. Many of these first blossoms appear on fruit trees, such as the apricot and quince blossoms. Forsythia blossoms traditionally bloom before the leaves. The lovely Red Emperor tulips create a radiant sight as they come into bloom long before other flowers greet the warm spring sunshine.

A Way to Remember Family and Friends Arabella Smart Parkinson Daines received many greeting cards, bouquets, books, and mementos, on her ninety-sixth birthday, October 23, 1968. Each remembrance spoke of appreciation, friendship, love, companionship—and each one mentioned the many long and fruitful years of a beloved mother, grand- +8. ' e &: h i' allie. Mother, great-grandmother—loyal Church worker and Relief Society officer and teacher. She was born in Franklin, Idaho, and as a young woman she worked in the Franklin store and also learned dressmaking. At eighteen she became head cook at the State Industrial School in Ogden, Utah. In May 1898 she was married to Robert H. Daines and they became the parents of five children, and they now have a large posterity of grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Sister Daines loves Relief Society, and through her years of service she has learned the usefulness and the beauty of the Relief Society program. She served as counselor under two Relief Society presidents in Preston, Idaho, and was a visiting teacher for many years. Her special fields' of compassionate service have been caring for the sick, visiting the homebound, cooking and taking meals to families in need, and teaching sewing and tailoring skills to many women and girls who have found the teachings useful in their homes. It is remembered that Arabella Smart Parkinson Daines taught her children loyalty, love, kindness, and concern for the welfare of others.

207 Transparency by Dorothy J. Roberts What A Lovely Thing To Do! Bouquets for the Chapel @ Each Sunday as one enters the chapel, eyes eagerly look for the unusually handsome flower arrangements—on the grand piano, on the secretary's table, in the entranceway. These are greetings especially for each member of the congregation, contribution to the Sabbath and to those she loves, and to the whole ward, from Bishop Lerwill Smith's wife Ruth, of the Portland, Oregon, Sixth Ward, Columbia River Stake. She is indeed a mother to the members. This is only one of her loving contributions to ward unity and joy. Her enchanting flower arrangements also beautify the homes of ward members and at special occasions. Some distinguishing marks of her bouquets are the drapes she often uses—satin, net, perhaps two-toned—twined through the flowers, fluffed around the base, with sometimes a figurine or two contributing to the effect. Always there is a thrilling harmony of color and design. She uses live flowers, artificial flowers, and mixtures of the two.

208 She says anyone can learn to arrange flowers beautifully. Here is what is needed and what is to be done: 1. Have suitable containers.
2. Get styrofoam in large pieces and cut out chunks to fit containers.
3. Have a spool of florist's wire to wire flowers and styrofoam to containers, and to attach bows and drapes.
4. Attach florist picks to droopy stems so they can be thrust into the styrofoam.
5. Use "Oasis," instead of styrofoam, for live flowers; soak it with water, then, when not in use, dry out for future use.
6. Use florist's 'tape to tape picks onto stems and to tape styrofoam to containers.
7. Pick garden flowers in the cool of the day and wrap in wet newspapers and set in deep cans of water after removing lower leaves and sharpening stems, if flowers are not too tender.
8. Separate flowers into groups of colors and sizes for easy selection.
9. Begin with a two or three flower center, to be the tallest part of the bouquet.
10. Build a shape, as the triangular, then fill the shape with the right flowers.
11. Have different textures, but not too much difference in sizes of flowers.
12. Grapes or fruits may be added.

Easter was brightened by her generous bouquet of lilacs, pink tulips, and artificial lilies twined with an orchid satin drape, gracing an elegant brass compote.

ALWAYS GREEN AND GROWING How extraordinary! Forsythia along the walk bursts bright and yellow in the spring; Its bell-shaped blossoms fling a jaunty song Denying grace to winter's lingering. Then, when the world is warmed beyond a frost And sweet with hyacinth or rose perfume, Forsythia turns to green, no beauty lost, And makes a blending backdrop for their bloom.

How extraordinary—to fashion thought That wakes an era; that flashes brilliant light Upon a wondering, waiting world, fraught With promise, penetrating mental night; That, always green and growing, will enfold The blossoming of truth, centuries old. —Mabel Jones Gabbott

MAKE YOUR HEIRLOOMS WITH DECOUPAGE (Continued from page 203)
Other Supplies pictures (gathered from cards, magazines, art stores, etc.)
plaques or boxes (buy at craft shops or have made at lumber stores)
gold filigree, trims, borders, corners (at craft stores—made of paper or gold)
antique glaze (many colors—medium brown is popular—in hobby shops)
clear liquid plastic varnish in spray cans called "finish" (from the hobby shops)
clear plastic varnish to be brushed on paint thinner water-base paints (from hobby shops)
cooking oil

Procedure 1. Pin the chosen picture flat on an old magazine, with the pins upright in the corners to keep the picture from curling. Then spray picture and desired gold filigree with "finish." This strengthens the picture. Let dry.
2. Sand the board or box with 221 sandpaper. Stain the board or box or paint with the desired color, using the small cans of water base paint; favorite colors are monde (earth green), ashen white, moss green, and butter yellow. Let dry.
3. Cut the background (all or part) from the picture very carefully and artistically. If pictures have print on the back, paint a thin layer of white water base paint over the print on the back of the picture. Let dry. Place the picture where desired on a board, box, or plaque, and outline it lightly with a pencil. Cover the back of the picture thinly with white glue.

(The glue may be diluted with a little water to spread more easily.) Place the picture within the outline and press from the center to the edges. Then roll with the roller to remove all air. With a damp cloth, wipe off all the glue from the article being made. 4. Apply varnish with brush over whole surface. Many coats are required to submerge the picture till it is even with the wood. Thirty to fifty coats will give a uniform finish with a beautiful surface. Allow each coat to dry thoroughly, six to twelve hours, depending on the temperature of the room and degree of moisture in the air. Test dryness by touching article with fingers. 5. When about twenty coats have been used, drop a few drops of water on the surface and then sand the surface lightly and evenly with No. 400 sandpaper, just to strike off the high spots. Sand thus after about every three to five coats of varnish. Much time may be saved by making a number of articles at one time and varnishing groups of articles at the same time. Then trim the edges and corners with gold filigree which has been sprayed. Glue into place and wipe away the excess glue with a damp cloth. 6. Apply antique glaze with brush, and wipe with cloth to get antique effect. Keep faces and hands in the picture clean of the antique glaze by keeping them wiped off with a cloth moistened with thinner, so they will not be darkened. Let dry. 7. Begin varnishing again, and varnish over entire surface. When imperfections show on surface, sand with 400 sandpaper, with three to five coats between sandings. Varnish will need straining through a nylon hose for the last third of the can and will need a little thinning toward the end. 8. Sand evenly and gently as directed, until there is no shine at all. Finish with 0000 steel wool. The more polishing, the better will be the finish. 9. Mix pumice with cooking oil to a paste. Apply with a piece of felt. Rub surface well and wipe away excess. Repeat, using rottenstone in place of pumice. Wipe the surface with paint thinner to remove any oil. Apply a wax-base furniture polish. If making wall plaques, apply felt on the backs and hang with a metal ring (from hobby store). Line the boxes with flocked paper or velveteen, or felt. Glue felt on base of boxes. Small hasps are available at craft stores.

1967-68 Annual Report

It is gratifying to note that, as of August 31, there were 311,871 women enrolled in Relief Society, an increase of 13,046 over the previous year. There were 3,065 Relief Society members who were not members of the Church, but who recognized the many opportunities for personal and spiritual development offered through membership in Relief Society. The report indicates not only growth in the number of women enrolled in Relief Society but also in the activities and achievements of the stake, mission, ward, and branch organizations. More than 207,550 members of Relief Society were given the opportunity to serve as officers and class leaders in the various organizations. Of this number 30,086 were appointed executive officers and directed the activities of the respective organizations; 12,839 served as organists, choristers, and magazine representatives; 25,579 class leaders helped to build and strengthen the testimonies of the sisters attending the various departments. There were 139,047 visiting teachers who faithfully visited the 626,998 Latter-day Saint families and 9,032 non-Latter-day Saint families listed in the Visiting Teacher Record Books. These devoted visiting teachers made a total of 5,063,077 visits to these homes carrying with them spiritual messages and the spirit of sisterly love. During the year there were 201,217 regular weekly meetings held in the wards and branches. In these meetings members studied the doctrines of the Church and thereby received spiritual development and increased testimonies. They participated in homemaking activities which helped them to develop their skills and talents and to become better homemakers. Instruction was given in ways to improve family relations, and opportunity for developing a greater appreciation for literature, art, and music was offered through a study of these subjects. The blessings of the Relief Society Magazine, printed in English, were extended to 277,386 homes. The Magazine printed in Spanish blessed the homes of 5,458 of the Spanish-speaking sisters. In the homemaking meetings, 1,449,337 articles were completed by members for themselves and for bazaars and welfare purposes. These articles consisted of quilts, clothing for children, men, and women, and household articles. The music program of Relief Society was enhanced through the services of 51,496 Singing Mothers who comprised the 3,612 Singing Mothers choruses organized in wards and branches in the Church. These choruses participated in concerts, stake conferences, and other functions and brought joy and happiness to those listening as well as cultural and spiritual development to those participating. The true spirit of Relief Society was manifested through the many hours of compassionate services rendered during the year. There were 25,738 eight-hour days spent in caring for the sick; 393,916 visits were made to the sick and homebound. Hours spent in other compassionate services amounted to 739,536. Relief Society members dressed 899 bodies for burial and assisted at 11,223 funerals, bringing comfort and solace to those bereaved. Under the direction of the priesthood, Relief Society continued to assist in the Church Welfare Program; 95,826 family visits and 93,915 other contacts were made by Relief Society presidents under the direction of the bishops to determine the needs of those being served through the welfare program. There were 60,546 Relief Society members who contributed 755,898 hours on welfare projects, such as canning foods and sewing needed clothing and other articles. The general board expresses grateful appreciation to Relief Society secretaries for the excellent recording of Relief Society activities that has made this report possible.

Neither of us could say more. Of course we didn't visit lots and lots. Helen was able to come when Timothy Bryan was born two years later. Her stay was not long enough. Katrina was a beautiful child, but by no means a model, just normal. I sensed a difference in Helen, though I couldn't pinpoint it. She was Helen, yet she seemed thoughtful, as if she had great matters of importance on her mind. After she went back East, years flew by as we wrote and exchanged many pictures. Katrina seemed never to hit an awkward stage as my five boys did. I guess she photographed well, and yet she just seemed to radiate from the snapshots. I knew she had Helen's outgoing spirit and strength, and Howard's sensitiveness and calmness. As for my boys—Eddie was gangling into teenage, Mickey lived up to his nickname, with red hair and freckles, Jimmy-Joe had finally quit breaking windows, at least ours, Davey Jones was beginning to love the ocean and ships, for some odd reason, and Timmy B. Seemed to be trying to surpass all his brothers. We had so much, Jeff and I, a moderate success, good health, and yet, sometimes, I wondered what was missing. I put it down as Helen, Howard, and Katrina. Just before Katrina's eighth birthday, Helen wrote and asked if we could come out for a special event, kind of make it a vacation trip; whatever it was, it was as important to her as when Ka— 220 (Continued from page 189) trina was born, and she wanted to share both times with us. Our whole family was excited; we got permission for the boys to leave school, and were half-packed when Timmy B. Came down with mumps. The last one left in our family to have them, but what a time to pick for mumps! Nor could he have them conveniently on both sides at once, making it possible for us to fly back East the last three days of our planned week. First the left and then the right! Both families felt sad and Helen still wouldn't explain what had happened so special. She said she wanted to see us face-to-face when she did. A month went by. Late one night the phone rang. Loud, sharp, and clear. It was Helen. A dull, lifeless voice—thousands of miles away, barely recognizable as our exuberant Helen. Howard was dead. Lost in his beloved sea. He had been caught in one of those Atlantic shoreline squalls. He and five boys in a small sailing yacht. He had trimmed the sails, got the boat going toward shore when a swell came, he slipped, and was gone. He had taught the boys well; they all made it in safely. We flew back for the services. Jeff helped wind up Howard's and Helen's affairs. I helped her pack. We all knew she and Katrina were coming home again. They were part of us. Katrina was a lost child. Davey Jones seemed to know just what to do and say to her, maybe because he was quiet and gentle like her father. I found I truly missed that quiet-in-the-background man. He had been so much more than I realized until he was gone. Helen was silent. Not quiet. Not cold. She talked, but she was silent. Like a lovely warm home, closed for a season. On our last evening there I went to the basement for paper to wrap the dishes in, and I found Helen and our Davey Jones going through Howard's foot locker. "Aunt Helen, I wish I were really Davey Jones. I'd give you back your Howard." Close to tears Davey tried to fold Howard's Navy dress whites. "David John, oh, no, son, son, Davey Jones doesn't have my Howard. No, not as good a man as he. Why, my Howard is in his glory. He has truly gone home, Davey, to his Father in heaven. He's at peace and is happier than our fondest dreams."

I grieve because I cannot see him for a time, and because Katrina must be reared without him, but someday Davey, if we are worthy, we can and will see him again, and all be together with Heavenly Father." Helen seemed almost her old self by the time we arrived home. Katrina was excited by flying, tired, and still a little confused. By the end of the week she seemed in much better spirits. In fact, both Helen and her daughter seemed excited on Friday evening when we all met in the family room as Helen had asked. We presumed it was to settle money arrangements and our living together as one family. Jeff was just starting to say something about all this to-do hardly being necessary, when Helen started to speak, not at the usual full-speed-ahead pace, but calmly, quietly.

"A Gift of Love" She and Howard had missed our family when they moved and had learned to appreciate the friendship we had all shared, but, especially, that shared by Helen and me. They kept trying to think of a gift suitable to show this appreciation.

"But we couldn't," she said, "because we didn't have the gift ourselves yet, so of course we couldn't give it." Just then the doorbell rang. "I'll get it," Helen called back over her shoulder, as she hurried out of the room. As I looked at my family I knew we were all trying to think of the gift one had to have oneself before one could give it to another. Katrina squirmed and tapped her foot, drummed her fingers, and smiled.

"Here we are," came Helen's voice as two clean-looking young men came in the room, then Helen herself. She introduced us first, then said, "These young men are called Mormon elders. Missionaries of our Heavenly Father, like these two, gave Howard, Katrina and me the gift of the true gospel, a beautiful gift that we would like you to have also." She looked at me, "Once you said I kept your feet on the ground, now I want you to reach for heaven itself. Please listen to them."

As the elders began to speak, my husband, our boys, and I looked at each other. Then I looked at Helen, my friend, and saw and heard again the scene back East in her basement. My heart seemed ready to open to the words to be given to us by the gift of love.

221 Julia Archibald Godfrey, Mount Ogden Stake, Utah, has made many friends and relatives happy with the gift of a lovely quilt. She has spent many hours teaching the art of quilting to others and has donated countless quilts to Relief Society. In addition to her quilting, Sister Godfrey does beautiful embroidery work. She has made many pairs of pillowcases and doilies, and makes lovely temple aprons. This dear sister is the mother of eight children.

Pst aed.* 7 vo 4 sae , Michele Bartmess as told by Annette Giles Synopsis: Jennifer Miles, a young girl of twenty-four, has been visiting friends in Houston. She has left behind Steve Rey, a young man to whom she is attracted. In Houston she meets handsome Jim Long who has devoted his attentions to her. The bishop of the ward is director of the famous Texas Heart Center. Jennifer's mother is suffering from a serious heart ailment, and a famous doctor has performed a delicate operation on her.

Mrs. Miles was pronounced well enough to return to Utah just five weeks after the surgery had been performed. It was a joyous day for all when Dr. Mayhew gave them the good news. Charles, Jennifer, and Elizabeth made plans to fly to Salt Lake City, where they would be met by a grateful and happy family. Jennifer's excitement at the prospect of returning home was not too severely dimmed by the necessity of bidding farewell to Jim, although she admitted that

Welcome the Task Chapter 5

she would miss him, and the attentions he had paid. He was serious that night.

"I'm glad your mother is better, Jenny, really I am. It is too bad she couldn't make it home for Christmas though."

"Yes, but everyone is just overjoyed that she is all right now. It was a lonely Christmas for the boys. Dad was willing to fly them here, but Dr. Mayhew felt the excitement might be too much."

"True. I personally am kind of glad you were here, however." He smiled down at her.

Jennifer had become quite accustomed to his good looks by this time. She knew this goodbye was going to be difficult for both, however it was only for two months, then he would be in Utah. There might even be more problems then.

223

Vee 8 yh ee March 1969 "What are your plans?" he asked.

"Well, if Mother doesn't need too much care, I'll resume classes in February, probably taking a light schedule so that I can be more helpful."

"And at the end of February, you're reserving time for me, right?"

"Of course, Jim, I'll see you. Mother has made it clear to you that you are welcome at the house."

"I'll want to see you alone, too," he reminded her.

She smiled at him. "Jim, you act as though we'll be apart forever. It is only two months; less than that, actually."

"I know," he said, "It's just that I hate to see you go. I've grown accustomed to having you around."

"Now, Jim," she teased. "Let's not make this hard, please."

"OK," he promised. "Just don't give your heart back to that fellow before I get there," he growled.

Jennifer smiled. "My heart isn't going anywhere for awhile, Jim." She laughed. "Now you smile, and tell me goodbye. I've got an early plane to catch, and you've an early radio show. I promise to listen to you on the way to the airport."

"And I'll play you a special song," he said, some of his old easy confidence beginning to come back.

Bea would miss Jennifer, but she was already occupied with her tiny granddaughter who had been born in early November. "It's so good to have a baby in the family at last," she announced proudly.

224 Elizabeth Miles was overjoyed at the prospect of returning to her sons and home. Dr. Mayhew gave Jennifer careful and detailed instructions concerning her care, which Jennifer took down in shorthand and typed for certain accuracy. As the plane circled the Salt Lake airport, Jennifer thought about the day when she had taken off, more than six months ago. She had been glad to go, but nothing could equal her joy upon returning. She had missed her home more in that six months than she had the entire time she spent in England. Yet, she had had such golden experiences in Houston, she would never regret having gone. The first people she saw as she followed her parents down the ramp were her three brothers, who could hardly stand still in their anticipation of being together as a family again, and especially of seeing their mother. Directly behind Sam stood Steve. She knew how to greet her brothers, but what about him? In the excitement of coming home, she had given that no thought. Tears fell freely as mother and sons, brothers and sister, and her mother's parents all greeted one another—the moment they had all hoped for but had dared not anticipate too much. "Mother stayed behind to have a good meal ready," Steve explained, as he smiled down at her in that old familiar way, taking her hand, and holding it a trifle longer than necessary. "We brought two cars," Dave said quietly. How he has grown, Jennifer thought. There was a maturity in his face and actions that had not been there when she left. His success in football had given him a new confidence, which her parents had prepared her for, but she was nevertheless surprised by his manly bearing and steady gaze. He broke into a smile and kissed her gently on the cheek. "I'm awfully glad you're back, Sis," he said. When she left, the last thing she would have expected from him was a show of affection of any kind. "I'm glad too, Dave, terribly glad," she said, with tears playing at her eyelids. "Count me in," Steve remarked. It was decided that Jennifer and Elizabeth's parents would ride to Springville with Steve, while the three boys would go with their parents. "They'll probably never stop chattering," Jennifer's sweet grandmother remarked. "It has been so long for them." "We are all so thankful she came back to us," her grandfather said. "It has been quite a strain on everyone." He was a stake president, and spoke with a matter-of-fact calmness that reminded Jennifer of the way her mother had always been, taking things as they came, worrying, but never sharing the worry, lest others be affected by it. The next few months were busy ones for Jennifer, as she carried out Dr. Mayhew's instructions regarding the care of her mother, and attempted to manage the home. No more did she feel the pangs of dissatisfaction which had plagued her earlier. Welcome the Task She was happy at home. And she knew she was where she should be and doing the thing she ought to be doing. Steve was more attentive, and she was able to help him by typing his papers. He was competing for an important scholarship that would enable him to do graduate work at the university of his choice, and much of his time was occupied with this. Jennifer had come to accept him as he was, demanding nothing. She had a letter from Jim Long telling her that he would be seeing her in February. She was looking forward to this and the start of a new semester. She was confused by her feeling for Jim and for Steve, so she took the problem to her mother. "It is a perplexing problem, Jenny," her mother told her. "But if you are faced with a decision between the two of them, you will know through prayer and your heart. Don't try to use logic in matters of the heart, for it's not always best. I'm not suggesting that you abandon your common sense, but don't get tangled up in it. You can't say, 'how this one is better looking, but that one has more money, or this one shows more promise of being—successful.' They seem to be pretty much equal in most things that count, like manners, grooming, integrity, Church activity. But if the time comes, my dear, you'll know which one is right for you, and which one needs you by his side. There is a great deal more to love than the physical attraction, but don't discount that either." They had many talks on the 225 "March 1969 qualities of a good wife and mother, each of which left Jennifer grateful for the example she had to follow. "Now, consider Pete," her mother told her during one of their talks. "He seems to be a pretty impetuous little fellow, never thinking, or really caring what the consequences of his actions will be, yet he's the most thoughtful character around here. Someday, and you mark my words, he is going to get himself into a jam, and he'll start thinking before he acts. I don't try to fight his personality too much, for to force a change on him would not be right. We have to mold character around what there is to begin with." Another time, she spoke of her eldest son. "Dave is growing up fast. One morning I discovered that he was becoming a man. It wasn't the smell of shaving lotion or the sudden quiet maturity, it was the over-all effect. He's a little like your grandfather, he doesn't say much, and it's hard to know what he is thinking. His biggest fault is that once he makes up his mind, it is very difficult to reason with him. Fortunately, he has learned well the difference between right and wrong. I suppose one of these days a girl will come along and he'll have to unbend a little. That is the beauty of life. We can't control them, but we can guide them in so many subtle ways." It seemed to Jennifer that the things her mother was saying were written indelibly on her mind. "Sammy's the one who is most like your father," her mother said one afternoon after Jennifer discovered that the youngster had dammed up the irrigation ditch in the field, causing a mild flood on the Miles property, and a great deal of indignation at the neighbor's. "You can be sure he wasn't in on it alone," her mother continued. "But, I am equally certain that he was the leader. Sammy needs discipline, but he also needs all the affection we can give him. I can't explain it, that self-confidence of his is a wondrous thing, but it has to be fed constantly. Do you understand what I mean?" "I think so," Jennifer replied, wondering if it would be possible to keep the boy out of mischief for even two hours at a time. He had been caught stealing apples from the neighbors again.

"I only took the ones that fell on the ground on our side of the fence," he stubbornly insisted. "And how did you make them fall?" his father asked. Sam was made to apologize and help pick the apples without remuneration. "Perhaps that will keep him busy for just a little while anyway," Charles commented when Sam left the room. The Miles family had never been closer. Mrs. Miles spent a good many hours at the piano, and the family, all of whom had been blessed with good singing voices, joined her. They sang all of the old family favorites and the hymns from the hymn book. Steve and also his mother often joined them for quiet evenings of enjoyment.

One afternoon in late January when Jennifer was visiting the campus with Steve, she met one of her former business instructors. "Jennifer, what a pleasant surprise. What are you doing with yourself these days?" Jennifer briefly explained to him what she had been doing. "You wouldn't happen to be interested in taking on some typing, on a rather permanent basis, would you?" he asked her. "Why, yes, Dr. Moran, I think I would enjoy that," she replied. "I am running this thesis typing service," he explained, "and I need a couple of really good typists who know the forms. It really pays quite well." Jennifer was excited. She enjoyed thesis typing, for the opportunity of learning in depth about so many different and fascinating subjects.

They made final arrangements, and Jennifer was once more gainfully employed. She had expected Jim Long to be rather shy at meeting the rest of her family. But the young man was full of confidence and impressed them all. He was excited and anxious to continue his law studies. She knew that he would make an excellent lawyer.

"Do you really like living in the country?" he asked her one day in the springtime. "I love it," Jennifer told him as she leaned against the walnut tree. "It is really a great place to visit," he commented, "but me, I have to have paved walks and lots of people around." He turned over on his stomach and gazed up at her. "I thought you liked Houston."

"It is a nice place for a visit," she answered, smiling. "Really welcome the task though, I am quite adaptable. There are advantages to both kinds of life, and I can be perfectly happy anywhere, if the circumstances are right." "That is what I call a well-adjusted person," he said, squeezing her hand.

She looked at the top of his dark head, such a contrast from Steve's blonde one. But that was the least of their differences, she thought. How was it possible for her to be attracted to both? After Jim left again, Steve was more attentive, but she suspected that was because he was leaving soon for California to complete a summer internship in journalism. He could afford to be attentive at times like that. She knew him too well to expect him to be jealous over Jim.

One afternoon, shortly before he was to leave, he came bounding across the lawn. She knew instantly that he had won the coveted scholarship. He hadn't mentioned where he would study. She knew that Columbia had a good journalism department, as did Stanford. Suddenly she didn't want him to go.

227 March 1969

She covered it up with a sincere display of interest and happiness. Perhaps it was best, she thought. He would leave for the summer, she was prepared for that, and she could work on forgetting him. Besides, Jim Long would return in September, she told herself.

"Where will you go this fall, Steve?" he looked serious for a moment, then grinned. "I will go to the Y, the same as if I hadn't received the scholarship." She was incredulous. "Why?"

"It's where I want to go," he told her. "I like it there, and it is rising each year on the scale of excellence as a graduate school. I can get everything I need and want there, and be near everyone who counts, too."

Mourned through the summer, Jennifer worried a great deal about her mother. She seemed to have weakened considerably. In late July she contracted a cold, with a racking cough that left her weak and exhausted after each attack. By mid-August she was no better; in fact, she seemed worse, and suffered a great deal of pain.

Jennifer's fears grew, and she sensed them also in her father. Bea had written to announce that she would be in Utah in late August, and Jennifer made feverish plans for her arrival. She seemed driven to have the house in perfect order. Still, she found time for the additional serious talks with her mother.

"Always welcome the task that takes you beyond yourself," her mother advised several times.

It was after visiting the doctor for a general check-up that it was suggested that Mrs. Miles enter the hospital. Jennifer could hardly bear the thought, for Elizabeth was so happy at home. But as the painful cough overtook her more and more frequently, Jennifer realized that only in the hospital could she receive the care and relief she needed so badly.

On the eve of the day Bea was to arrive, Jennifer fell into bed exhausted. The house was in order, some advance meals prepared and in the freezer, and desserts readied. It had been hectic. Jennifer could not recall ever working so hard.

Her mother had been in the hospital for a week, and that evening she had seemed somewhat better. "Goodbye, my darlings," she said softly as they prepared to leave. Each of the boys had been extra tender. Pete's goodbye had been most disturbing to Jennifer as she thought back over it. Each of them had kissed Mrs. Miles and said good night. Pete had leaned down and kissed her gently.

"Goodbye, Mother," he said softly. Mrs. Miles responded with her "Goodbye, my darlings."

Jennifer, though exhausted, lay awake for a long while. She had no idea how long she had been sleeping when the telephone downstairs sounded loudly in the dead silence of the night. Getting up quickly, she hurried downstairs just as her father was hanging up. He looked gray and frightened.

"Jenny," he said, "I think we had better go to the hospital."

Evalyn Olsen, President, Oquirrh East Stake Relief Society, reports: "The Spencer Third Ward presented a social with the theme, 'What's Cooking in Relief Society?' An original skit written by Connie Johns was presented. It featured a gaily covered table with a large kettle and spoon. Various spices and cooking ingredients were on the table. Each member of the presidency and the class leaders wore white chef's hats. During the course of the program, each leader gave a preview of her course and added to the cooking pot her special ingredients or objectives. "It was a well-planned and successful event. There were fifty-eight present at the social. The ward has an enrollment of forty-six." 229 March 1969 Gridley Stake (California), Chico Ward Holds "Toyland" Bazaar, June 26, 1968 Chico Ward Relief Society officers, left to right: Sharon Sheldon, homemaking leader; Leona Turley, Education Counselor; Johanna Millet, President; Joyce Atkin, Homemaking Counselor. Marietta White, President, Gridley Stake Relief Society, reports: "The Chico Ward held a most successful bazaar, with the theme, 'Toyland.' The main features of the bazaar were Raggedy Ann and Andy dolls and stuffed toys, made by the sisters. "It was a pleasant coincidence for President Millet to discover that she and both her counselors share the same birthdate, November 7. They have enjoyed the sisterhood they share through working in Relief Society, and this ward has progressed well under their leadership." Danish Mission, Jylland District Fall Social September 1968 Marva S. Christensen, Supervisor, Danish Mission Relief Society, reports: "The Relief Society sisters in Jylland District planned a gala event for a fall social. It was under the direction of Sisters Meta Dybvang; Sonja Lind Jensen; Karna Petersen; and Ruth Petersen. "All the sisters in the district gathered in Aarhus, and the officers met in a leadership meeting. The doors to the new lessons for the coming year were opened, and a demonstration on handicraft was presented. 'Following the meeting, the sisters and a member of the priesthood met for a lovely Danish meal. There were over 100 in attendance, who enjoyed the dinner and the entertainment provided by members of the local branch. The sisters had gathered heather from the hills and flowers from their gardens to make beautiful centerpieces for the tables."

Each ward presented a portion of the program. "Special honors were given to Sister Annie C. Esplin for her talents in writing which have brought so much joy to many people. Sister Esplin has had many articles published in The Relief Society Magazine. We are very proud of this wonderful sister and her dear spirit which adds so much to our meetings." 230 Nampa Stake (Idaho) Holds Fall Social And Style Show September 20, 1968 Ginger Fuhriman, Magazine representative, Nampa Stake Relief Society, modeling her lovely outfit. Ruth Davis, President, Nampa Stake Relief Society, reports: "Our fall social took the form of a style show, with many lovely outfits modeled by the sisters who made them. As each outfit was modeled, violin music and a piano played background music for a brief narration describing the material and style. "The stage was beautifully decorated with bright colored flowers and a picket fence. It was a successful social." American Fork Stake (Utah) 'Friendship Builds Membership" Luncheon Honors Ward Presidencies, August 21, 1968 Seated at the head of the table, left to right: Letha Durfey, First Counselor, American Fork Stake Relief Society; Alice Wilkinson, member, General Board of Relief Society; Ethel M. Mecham, President, American Fork Stake Relief Society; Thorma Beer, Second Counselor. Members of the stake board are seated among the guests. Sister Mecham reports: "A delightful luncheon, introducing the theme of our Relief Society for the coming year, 'Friendship Builds Membership,' honored our ward presidencies, with the stake board acting as hostesses. "The sisters received the message of the theme with great enthusiasm, and have taken back to their own wards posters, messages, skits, and songs. Each year we choose a theme to emphasize at leadership meetings, which helps us build the effectiveness of our Relief Society. "A most inspirational talk relevant to the theme was given by Sister Alice Wilkinson of the General Board."

Taylor Northern Hemisphere: Second Meeting, June 1969 Southern Hemisphere: October 1969 OBJECTIVE: To show how, by becoming aware of the necessity of outside as well as inside housekeeping, we can appraise our homes and determine any necessary improvements. INTRODUCTION One of our common human frailties is our inability to evaluate ourselves and our possessions honestly and objectively. There may be those who are able to make a fairly honest and moderate appraisal of themselves, but many of us tend to move from moderation in our self-evaluations toward one extreme or the other. Either we look with "a jaundiced eye" and nothing is commendable, or we go to the other extreme and fail to see any sign of blemish or fault in ourselves or in things which pertain to us personally. In either position we get a distorted view. The poet Robert Burns, recognizing this tendency in men and women, says, "O wad some power and gifti gie us, To see ourselves as others see us?" It is a wholesome practice to examine our lives occasionally and make an honest appraisal of ourselves and our surroundings. It might well be that we would find a new outlook�a motive and an incentive to take pride in our 237 March 1969 PLAN YOUR VACATION WITH US Annual Tours: * California Holiday July 5th-16th * Hill Cumorah Pageant 16 days and 23 days leaving July 26th * Black Hills Passion Play August 17th-24th * Canadian Rockies and Northwest August 18th-31st * Hawaiian Aloha Week October 11th-25th Call or Write for itineraries James Travel Tours 2230 Scenic Drive Salt Lake City, Utah 84109 Phone: 466-8723 'Total electric living UTAH POWER & LIGHT CO. 238 positive assets and to make adjustments toward improvement where the need is indicated. Since our external environment has much to do with our physical, mental, and spiritual makeup and development; and since our homes are actually, outside as well as inside, a reflection of ourselves, we need to become aware of this part of our life and living. This discussion will emphasize the importance of keeping the outside of our homes in good order by making an appraisal of the exteriors of the homes we live in and thereby determining the needed improvements. HOW SHALL WE APPROACH THE PROBLEM? Shall we take a walk around the block or area on which our home is located? As we look at the various houses we may be impressed by the well-kept appearance of each one in turn and be filled with a feeling of pride in belonging to such a neighborhood. Then we may ask ourselves, "What makes these places so attractive? What distinguishing features are characteristic of the exterior of a well-kept home? We will probably come to the conclusion that there are specific requirements in maintaining a satisfactory home exterior. WHAT DISTINGUISHES A WELL-KEPT EXTERIOR? 1. All wood surfaces should be kept painted or stained. (A coat of fresh paint or of varnish or wood stain can make a world of difference in the appearance of a house.) 2. Windows should be kept clean and shining. (The evidence of clean, fresh curtains or drapes adds considerable to the outside appearance of the home.) 3. Porches, entrances, and steps should be kept clean and uncluttered. 4. Gates, doors, and garage entrances should be clean and free from fingerprints, grime, and other disfigurements. 5. Awnings and shades should be kept in good repair�no sagging, ragged edges, faded and dingy colors, etc. 6. Garbage cans should be kept out of sight or inconspicuously placed. 7. Mail boxes should be appropriate to the surroundings and accessible. HOW DOES OUR OWN HOME COMPARE? As we come back to our own homes and examine them with a critical eye, are we pleased with what we see? Does the appearance of our home fill us with a well-deserved pride of possession, or do we look at it and feel that there are many improvements which could and should be made? Most of these requirements are not outside the financial limits of the least affluent of us.
