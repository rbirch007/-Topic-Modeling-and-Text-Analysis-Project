ONLY THE BELIEVER Dorothy J. Roberts How vast were the dreams that raised a temple spire Above the bitter sage of wilderness; How strong were driven hearts that did not tire And yield the coming generations less Of majesty.... Rock-hewn and poplar-lined, How wise to lay the highways broad and straight For even journeying by foot and mind. How far their sight an iron festooned gate, For unborn keepers of the dynasty, Arches their story and a city street. How true their vision, that a progeny Find wisdom, and with lips and hands repeat The prayer once kindled by celestial fire? The sculptured temple of their souls' desire. Never the cynic left a dream fulfilled, Graceful and granite in the atmosphere; But, moved by vision, the believer willed His calloused palm to chisel rock and year Into the image of his noblest dream; Only the dreamer carves its counterpart, A pointed steeple, with a silver seam Edging the pattern taken from his heart; Only the bearer of a flame of faith Etches his vision on the rough terrain. Never the skeptic leaves his futile breath Monumented over a conquered plain; Only the believer, with a dream held fast, Utters a mortared message from the past. The Cover: "Sea Gulls Over the Valley" Photograph by T. J. Howells, M. D. VOL. 33, NO. 7 JULY 1946 " HOLLYHOcks" From a Photograph by Grace O. Tuttle Opportunities at Brigham Young University for the Youth of the Church President Howard S. McDonald EVENTY years ago, President S Brigham Young called Karl G. Maeser to Provo to establish an institution of learning which should be fundamentally and essentially a Latter-day Saint school, a school wherein all functions would reflect fully and completely the spirit and genius of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Under the inspirational leadership of Presidents Karl G. Maeser, Benjamin Cluff, Jr., George H. Brimhall, and Franklin S. Harris, Brigham Young University has grown from a few students to the present enrollment of over thirty-two hundred young men and women. 'The physical facilities have grown from vacant rooms in downtown business houses to an entire block of buildings on the lower campus, and to four modern buildings on the upper campus. The building program for the future points to the realization of many more needed buildings for the University in the next few years. What does Brigham Young University offer to young men and women? In the college of applied science students may obtain bachelor of science degrees in the following fields: agronomy, animal husbandry, bacteriology, horticulture, landscape architecture, mechanic arts, and home economics. This article will not permit an extensive summary of each of the courses, but the main objective in our home economics course is to teach our young people the mechanics of operating a modern home, and to instill into the hearts of every student the ideals of the Latter-day Saint home. The primary purpose of the curriculum offered in the college of arts and sciences is to meet the needs of the students who desire a broad and liberal education that will enable them to find and take their places in the complex civilization of today. Abundant opportunity is provided for those who have ambition for specialized study in engineering, medicine, or law; or for those who desire to train for political or social leadership. Students who desire to prepare for the professions will find this college filled with studies which are fundamental. The college of commerce provides training for leadership in industry and finance. Courses are so arranged that students will be given the training that will best fit them for analyzing business conditions, for efficiency in office administration, and for the demands of the industrial and financial world. The college of education is one of the professional schools of the University. Its function is the training Page 435 436 of teachers. Never in the history of the world has there been such a demand for well-trained teachers. Today, four hundred thousand well-trained teachers are needed to fill the needs of the public schools in the United States. Brigham Young University meets the requirements of the Utah State Board of Education for the various grades of elementary and high school certification, and for certificates and diplomas in administration and supervision. The college of fine arts is excellently prepared to provide Opportunities to those who desire to follow these fields of study. Well organized courses are offered in the following fields: Art ? drawing, painting, modeling, design, history, and appreciation; Music theory, instrumental, vocal: Speech public speaking, dramatic art, play production, speech correction, radio. It is the purpose of the division of religion to carry out the important viewpoint of a proper blending of religious and moral values with secular knowledge. When a student has completed his courses at Brigham Young University, he should not be left in doubt in regard to the restored gospel of Jesus Christ as taught by the Prophet Joseph Smith. Brigham Young University has a fully organized graduate school where students may continue their studies for advanced degrees in the subjects taught in the various colleges. The master's degree has been recognized on the campus for many years. Plans are being formulated for the establishment of the doctor of philosophy degree in theology and other fields of study. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?JULY 1946 For the benefit of servicemen, a full quarter of eleven weeks will be conducted during the summer months. HE various courses offered at Brigham Young University have been very briefly summarized. Now, why do students from all parts of the world attend this University? Here are the reasons of four students: Willis Waite from San Diego, California, says: California is my home. In this State are found many of the most famous institutes of learning in the world; indeed, the educational opportunities for its youth are vast and varied. Notwithstanding these impressive facts, I found my inclinations, at that time in my life when it was necessary for me to choose at which university I should receive my education, led me to regard that belonging to my Church as the one ideally suited to my purpose and aspirations. I was not deterred by the realization that if I did become a student at Brigham Young University, it would inevitably mean I must travel some distance from my home, my loved ones, and my friends. I consequently made the whole project a matter of prayer. In the meantime, arrangements had been made for my enrollment at the University of California, but, in spite of this, without any hesitation I ultimately decided for the B. Y. U. I presented myself at the "Y" with full confidence that in so doing I was in harmony with the will of my Heavenly Father. I was immediately impressed with the unusual spirit which prevailed throughout the school. Everywhere, friendliness was the order of the day; and it not merely manifested itself among the students but in a close bond of helpful intimacy between students and faculty. From the first, the knowledge that those at the head of this institution and the professors in the classroom held the priesthood of God and had a knowledge of the gospel of Jesus Christ, which I so dearly love, gave me a wonderful feeling of confidence, a sense of deeper understanding which was not confined to the precincts of the classroom, but was a part of every social activity also. I have a grand feeling of belonging here, of being a part of the school. It offers me not only the best in academic learning, but teaches me (in contrast with so many of our universities) that there is a Father in heaven who loves his children. It teaches me the power of prayer. It teaches me, in general, the fundamentals of human happiness. The traditions of Bingham Young University have become important in my scheme of things. I have found so many things to admire, some to love, and not a few to make me exceedingly humble and thankful for my being here. Lucile Rose from New Jersey writes: What does Brigham Young University offer a young Mormon from New Jersey? I think that this question can be answered in three fields; that of education, of travel, and of everyday religious contacts. Besides the opportunity of a general education and specialized training in various fields, Brigham Young University opens one's eyes to the fact that the professors are, in themselves, remarkable people. In high school, one often felt his teachers were not real persons who had gone through similar experiences. There is much to be gained through associations with such accomplished persons as are on the Brigham Young University faculty. This school also offers everyone the equal chance to grow and to develop his talents. Each person may expand his personality in a school where money and clothes are not of first-rate importance. There is a constant cry for talent, and organizations like Lambda Delta Sigma, which are open to everyone, are a good way to develop one's talents. Second, Brigham Young University offers one from the East the opportunity to travel, not only on the journey here, but also during the week-ends and vacation periods. One becomes acquainted with many grand people who live here and who are only too glad to show you their communities. Some of the most beautiful land in the country is here in the West: national parks, mountains, and awe-inspiring canyons. These travels help one to know and understand the problems of other peoples. Thus, one's scope and culture are broadened. The third field, that of everyday religious contacts, is to me of utmost importance. Here, at Brigham Young University, we have the opportunity of observing and living with the Latter-day Saints in Zion. The lifelong friendships that are made with other Latter-day Saints from all parts of the country some even from outside the country are invaluable. In a school such as this the people are naturally more friendly because they have so much in common. Brigham Young University is often spoken of as a matrimonial school. This is very true and is easily comprehended. Our religion is quite different in many aspects from any other. Therefore, it is of much importance to us as individuals to marry someone who believes as we do. To this university come Latter-day Saints from everywhere, many hoping to meet the person with whom they would like to live for time and all eternity. With so much in common, it is only natural that many meet these partners and marry them. In conclusion, I would like to say that I believe that one's religion is put to more of a test here than in a place where there are very few Latter-day Saints. When in such a location one realizes that to the rest of the people he represents Mormonism and that he is watched every moment. As a Catholic friend of mine, who is attending the B. Y. U., feels that it is his mission so to live, so do we Latter-day Saints in the East feel that we are fulfilling an important mission by our very acts and deeds. Unfortunate as it may be, the majority of people in this world still judge by stereotypes. Therefore, we must be good examples, for we are told that not only shall we be accountable for our own deeds but also that we who possess a greater knowledge shall also be held responsible if we are stumbling blocks for anyone else. Here in Utah, one's religion is taken for granted, as so many of the people are Latter-day Saints. One does OPPORTUNITIES AT BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY 437 438 not have to defend himself in discussions or stand up for his beliefs as often as in other states. Therefore, many Jack 2 good knowledge of the gospel, something which every Latter-day Saint should have. Attending Brigham Young University has been an experience which I shall never forget. I only wish that I could thank all those who have been responsible for it. Moana Ballif from Provo, Utah, says: I came to Brigham Young University because: First, I believe the gospel of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and I had a keen desire to be in a school where my education would be guided by the standards it teaches. I wanted to come to a university which was founded and developed so that young people could learn their religion while they were learning other facts in other fields. Second, I wanted to live at home while I got my education. The adjustment to college life is difficult enough without having to adjust to a completely new home environment and living habits. The advantages of living at home with sympathetic and understanding parents are many and varied, and constitute a very valid reason for staying at home for my college education. Third, it is doubtful if there is any other campus in the world where a person can associate with people of uniform backgrounds who have been taught a recognition of the value of high moral codes. I believed that here at B. Y. U. I could find students with whom I would be proud to associate and from whom I could select friends and companions. Fourth, I believed that here on this campus I could find men and women expertly trained and brilliant in their fields under whom I could study. Here, education was for the asking only, and with a little effort on my part I could come as near the ultimate in cultural education as anywhere in the United States. Here, I could find a philosophy and an education within my grasp. Here, I could study with professors who could lift me into the realms somewhere near the stars. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE JULY 1946 Fifth, I decided that here was a school rich in a tradition which I wanted to have. Here, social life was given consideration on the campus. And, most important, the social program was filled with activities of a high standard in which | could participate and enjoy without being forced to decide between lowering, my standards or ignoring social life. Sixth, and finally, this was a school that I could help to build. It was a growing school on_ the road to unlimited development. Here was an institution dedicated to the principle of eternal progression, and, I thought, with all humility, that maybe I, too, could add a little bit to that pathway of eternal progression. I wanted to be one of the students who made positive the work of the men who founded this university with faith that others in the world might see our good works and realize the value of the gospel and what it means. Edith Russell, from London, England, writes: Oxford ? remote and unassailable. Study laborious striving to understand the obscure; without help, save that of prayer; without purpose, save that of self-vindication. A dread of ignorance and a passionate urge to emulate greatness. Absurd longings. Futile counting of pennies to buy the printed heritage of other men's brains. And then, democracy spilling over the ramparts of America, invading English shores. Opportunity. The distant University of Brigham Young opening wide its doors. Incredible. The consummate understanding and provision of God. 1 love it all; the quiet symphony of the great library; the muted music of struggle and achievement; the solemn tenor of slow-moving minds and the stimulating lilt of eager brains. And here, too, one may estimate with clearer eyes the noble heritage to which he is heir; feel the weight of it; experience the thrill of it; somewhere find the courage to accept it; and apply himself, vigorously, to carry it in his own two hands and lay it like balm on the wounds of the world. John H. Taylor President Richard L. Evans Of the First Council of Seventy JOHN H. TAYLOR LIFETIME career of service to the Church ended on Tuesday, May 28th, 1946, when death came to Elder John H. Taylor of the First Council of Seventy as he was standing before a class of missionaries at the Mission Home jin Salt Lake City. Six months before, President Taylor had had his first Warning of a heart ailment, but at the time of his passing, he was again performing Many of his duties. Including Participation as a member of the Missionary Committee. Death came quietly, peacefully, mercifully, as he Paused during his 'nstructions to the missionaries and asked to be excused. Those were the last words he spoke, and one of the Church's distinguished sons, one of its General Authorities, had gone to another field of labor, after nearly seventy-one years of consistent, interesting and earnest living. Funeral services for Brother Taylor were held in the Assembly Hall cn Temple Square at 12:30 P. M., Friday, May 31st, conducted by President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. In the absence of President George Albert Smith, who was In Mexico. President David O. McKay, Elder Stephen L Richards, and Elder Richard L. Evans were the speakers. Brother John Taylor's missionary Career included service in Great Britain from 1896 to 1898. After his return and marriage, to Rachel Grant, eldest child of President Heber J. Grant, he attended the Chicago College of Dental Surgery, being graduated in 1901, and immediately thereafter became a practicing dentist in Salt Lake City. This profession he interrupted to answer another call as a missionary, this lime to the Netherlands. 1907 to 1909, leaving his wife and two young children at home. After this second mission he did Post-graduate work, and resumed dental practice, but later gave up his successful profession to enter the full-time service of the Church, becoming a member of the General Board of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association in 1911, Continued on Page 465 Giga 57. Pioneer Stories and Incidents Indians on the Plains President Amy Brown Lyman This is the first in a series of true pioneer incidents to be published by The Relief Society Magazine in honor of the 1947 Utah Centennial celebration AMONG the many problems confronting the Mormon pioneers, both on the plains and afterward in "the Valley," were those connected with the Indians. Notwithstanding the precautions taken by the pioneers, and their desire to deal fairly with the Indians, many trying situations presented themselves. On their part, the Indians naturally resented the white people and, to add to the difficulties, there was enmity among the various Indian tribes. While the Indians on the plains, mostly Pawnees and Sioux, were apparently friendly to the pioneers, they were mercenary, and the temptation for them to steal horses and cattle was often too great for them to resist. Their method was to follow the pioneer tram quietly and stealthily, and, in the darkness of night, to creep in among the animals, cut their ropes, and foment a stampede. In most cases the animals would scatter in all directions, and the Indians usually succeeded in making off with some of them. In the Journal or the pioneer John Brown, we read: Next day we... Reached Ash Hollow near the Platte. We camped near the brush in the hollow after dark... I came on the second watch that night. The first guard told us to keep a sharp lookout. The mules were very uneasy. One man discovered something near where a Page 440 mule was staked, and threw a bone at it, supposing it to be a dog, but it ran off like a man half bent. About this time I discovered a horse going loose across the corral. I went and examined the rope which was about six feet long. I felt the end of it and pronounced it cut and immediately alarmed the camp and turned out all hands. We found several horses cut loose and one mare and two colts missing. We kept everything close till morning when a search was made and a trail up the hollow in the sand showed where the three animals had been driven off, and nine pairs of moccasin tracks in the trail were found.... Six men followed the trail that day but could find nothing (Autobiography of John Brown, page 8). On the return trip of the pioneers across the plains (September 20, 1847) at LaBorte in the Black Hills, pioneer Brown wrote: About an hour by sun we went to drive in our animals to start our journey. Brother G. A. Smith and myself had got about halfway to the horses when the guard gave the alarm that the Indians had charged upon the herd and we could hear them yelling and firing their guns. We, not having our arms with us, ran back to get them. I got my rifle and started back to the herd but had not gone more than 100 yards when I met the Indians, who were coming on both sides of the river and over the hills some two or three hundred in number. We were soon mixed up and the greatest confusion prevailed for a few minutes. Our animals were all secured but eleven head which the Indians succeeded in running off at the beginning. No one was hurt during the whole struggle. They took all my (Continued on page 463) The Settlement of Sanpete Valley Leda Thompson Jensen Former Member, Relief Society General Board PART II THE early communities that dotted Sanpete Valley from north to south were settled by groups of converts to the Church selected by Brigham Young. He used great judgment and wisdom in the selection of these groups of people to settle different localities, considering carefully their backgrounds, aptitudes, and previous training in connection with the possibilities of the region they were to settle. Most of the fifty families sent to Manti in 1849 were from the northeastern part of the United States or from England. In 1850, however, apostle Erastus Poe SS MS ERS. PSS Photograph by Grace O. Tuttle Snow was sent to Europe to open missions in the Scandinavian countries, and many converts from the "Northland" soon immigrated to the "Valleys of the Mountains." The altitude of Sanpete Valley is much higher than Salt Lake Valley, and hence, colder. Sanpete was, and always has been, essentially an agricultural section. When, in 1853, the first immigrants from Denmark arrived in Salt Lake City, they were sent on to Sanpete. These people, coming from countries where farming and cattle raising were the principal industries, understood how to meet the conditions in Sanpete MOUNT BALDY, NEAR THE HEAD OF TWELVE MILE CANYON This lofty summit, one of the most beautiful in Sanpete Valley, overlooks a wide area of scenic interest and rises above the plateau grazing lands, east of Gunnison, Utah. Page 441 442 ley; and it was not long before they built comfortable homes for themselves and roomy barns for their cattle. These Scandinavian converts, many of whom had traveled across the plains in the handcart companies, were now in the majority in Sanpete Valley, particularly in Ephraim, and several of the towns were affectionately called "Little Denmark." These hardy saints brought with them a knowledge of economy, conservation, and husbandry, a valuable contribution to the Valley commonwealth. At first, the Danish pioneers were somewhat misunderstood by the earlier settlers, but the young people soon became interested in one another and began to intermarry. The barriers of nationality were forgotten by the people of the second generation; and all worked together RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE JULY 1946 side by side, excellent citizens, loyal to their country and to the Church which had brought them together in a new land. No matter from what countries the Utah pioneers came, no matter what traditions of the old countries they brought with them, no matter what customs they had known before, they were all interested in working for the same objectives. Their first concern was to till the soil that life might be sustained, and to build homes that their families might be comfortably sheltered. The philosophy of community life held by the Church, and the natural conditions of the soil, the water supply, and the common enemy, the Indians all these forces, working together, produced a united front, strong and courageous. By 1860, the larger settlements? Manti, Spring City, Ephraim, CUTTING THE STONE FOR THE MANTI TEMPLE Out of an unbroken terrain was hewn the oolite stone to build the edifice and the protecting wall, BUILDING THE FOUNDA Mount Pleasant, Moroni, Gunnison, Fairview, and Fountain had all been located quarried Mountains, Mount Pleasant, Moroni, Gunnison, Fairview, and Fountain Green had all been located and were growing communities. Later, enterprising men from these towns branched out to nearby sites and founded the smaller villages � Indianola, Milburn, Chester, Sterling, Fayette, Mayfield, Centerfield, and Axtell. These communities were soon eager for more than a mere living. They looked forward to the acquisition of knowledge, to their cultural improvement, and to their spiritual betterment. The first public buildings erected were designed for Church gatherings and for schools. Often the same building was used for both purposes until time and means would permit the erection of another building. The materials close at hand were used to build the early meeting houses which were called tabernacles rather than ward chapels, as they are designated today. In the Wasatch Mountains bordering the Sanpete Valley to the east, were found ledges of oolite, a very beautiful white limestone. This was quarried out of the mountains, shaped and cut by expert stonecutters, and used for the building of the first meeting houses. The walls were thick and the structures so well built that nearly all of these first churches are still in use, although they have been remodeled to accommodate the growing and changing needs of the Church. Sanpete Stake was organized July 4, 1877, with Canute Peterson as president and Henry Beal and John B. Maiben as counselors. Thus, all the smaller ward units in the Valley were united with the larger settlements under one head, and unitedly they began the tremendous task of building a temple to the Most High. ON an August day in 1850, President Brigham Young, then on his first visit to the settlements in Sanpete Valley, had pointed to  THE MANTI TABERNACLE (1890) The women, dressed in Danish costumes, are assembled to take part in the celebration welcoming the railroad. Note the replica of a railroad engine near the top of the building. The evergreen decorations on each side were designed and contributed by the various Sanpete Valley towns. Manti Hill and prophesied that a temple should one day stand thereon. Heber C. Kimball, one of President Young's companions on the trip, further testified that this temple should be built of stone quarried from the very heart of the hill. More than twenty years later, April 25, 1877, President Young dedicated this temple site. With his cane, he indicated the spot on which the southwest corner of the building should stand. Faith and perseverance characterized the people in this great undertaking. The saints donated liberally of their scanty funds and work on the temple was donated freely, following the advice of Brigham Young when he said to the bishops: "Now bishops, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?JULY 1946 if any person should inquire what wages are to be paid for work done on this temple, let the answer be 'Not one cent.''"" From the unbroken terrain was hewn the oolite to build the edifice and the protecting wall. The best the people had to give in skill and industry was put into this great temple, and in eleven years it was completed. On the spring morning of May 20, 1888, the dedicatory services began. 'These services were repeated on the three following days in order to accommodate the many saints who desired to attend the sacred dedication. Although schools were established as soon as possible after the settlements were founded, and, during the winter months, men and women gifted in the art of teaching were called, or, by choice, acted as teachers, the early days in Sanpete Valley did not provide many educational opportunities. President Canute Peterson and other community leaders felt that there was a great need among the people for a school which would provide training beyond the grammar grades. The pioneers believed that their children should have educational advantages near their homes so that they might become leaders in their own communities. In 1888, the Sanpete Stake Academy was established at Ephraim, and, although it was, in the beginning, a school comparable to our modem high schools, it served as an institution of higher learning. Not only did its students come from all over Sanpete County, but from other counties as well. The beginnings of this Academy were humble, but through faith and persistence the school prospered and grew, and THE SETTLEMENT OF SANPETE VALLEY 445 Presidents of the Manti Temple: Daniel H.

That broadened the horizon for the the enthusiasm and spirituality of its students were sources of strength that broadened the horizon for the people of the Valley. This college, originally a Latter-day Saint institution, is now a State-supported junior college, and stands as a monument to the vision and the determination oft hose early pioneers. Construction of a courthouse was begun in 1864. The original building consisted of one room, built of adobe, and plastered on the outside. In 1873, an additional room, built of stone, was added, and a porch built on the west side. Additional improvements were made later and the building was in constant use until 1937, when a new building was erected and the old one torn down. The first means of communication with the outside world, aside from trips made on horseback or by horse or oxen-drawn conveyances, came in December 1866, when the Deseret Telegraph Line was completed to Manti. This placed Sanpete in direct  communication with the capital city, and gave the farmers and stockmen valuable information on the prices of grain and cattle, thus advising them when to start by team or horseback to market their products. In the early 79�s, the Valley was connected with the outside (Continued on page 464) Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent July 1 and July 15, 1886 For THE RIGHTS OF THE Women OF ZION AND THE Rights OF THE WOMEN or ALL NATIONS ETHICS OF WOMAN'S REST: Let every woman who finds her vital forces failing, who is growing nervous, whose chief longing is for rest of mind and body, who begins to feel that life is not worth the living, stop now and here. Cut off all expenditure of effort that is not an absolute necessity, and curtail that necessity as much as possible.... Remember this: It is important that you should keep a reserve of physical power on hand for future draughts, as that you should provide in a financial way for sickness, accidents, and declining years. ?Emily Bouton * * * *% TRUTHFUL REASONINGS: God, our Heavenly Father, is the great law giver or ruler over this planet. He has declared himself Lord of lords and King of kings. He at various periods of time has dethroned kings and mighty governments, and wrought marvelous changes in the destinies of nations. God has chosen agents to usher in His dispensations and decrees; but He is just, and before He takes an action to accomplish His purposes He holds out offers of mercy and salvation, and pleads with His children for many years. M. A. M. Pratt FROM TEBBSDALE, UTAH: We have a Relief Society organized here, presided over by Sister Hannah LeFevre, and though few in numbers, we consider it a pleasure as well as a duty to meet together in the interest of woman's rights and privileges, to exchange ideas and sentiments, and thus cultivate our minds and enlarge our abilities.... We take the Exponent and learn from it the spirit of the times and the advancement of woman, and we are deeply interested in the instruction it contains.... The most of us have large families and the consequent duties engross most of our time; having our clothing neat but plain, our food simple but wholesome and appetizing, we would be enabled to spare a little time in which to devote to intellectual pleasures.

Page 447 EDITORIAL ~~VOL. 33 JULY 1946 She Pioneering Heritage THE word "pioneer" usually symbolizes the successful surmounting of physical obstacles and hardships, the performance of deeds of courage and heroism. One pictures a long line of covered wagons lumbering heavily, clumsily, over rough, uneven ground. One hears the rumble of slowly-turning, creaking wheels, the dull thud of oxen hoofs, the crack of whips and the sound of raised voices, barely distinguishable through the thick, enveloping dust which seems to hang motionless, half obliterating the wagon train in the stifling, noonday heat. Or one may call to mind a more poignant scene one in which the company of pioneers moves even more slowly, more laboriously, as human beings pull and push rudely built handcarts, wearily, haltingly, agonizingly trying to keep moving by counting the steps taken, by counting the revolutions of the large wheels, seeking to refresh the mind with the remembrance of flowered hedgerows, of cool, flowing waters, far from the hot, parched plains stretching endlessly before them. Gone, however, are these pioneer modes of travel, and, in their place, today a low-slung, streamlined car races over that same road, now smoothed and graded, and, high in the air above, a plane spans the horizon in a matter of minutes. When one compares the two epochs there would seem to be little Page 448 in common between the pioneer folk of that earlier period and the folk of the present time. These contrasting pictures, however, do not take into account the woman seated in the covered wagon, the woman trudging along with the handcart, the woman driving the speeding car, and the woman in the plane. Human frailties and human strengths are found in each of the four women. Each passes through the same fundamental experiences birth and death, sorrow and anguish, happiness and joy. The type of home in which one lives, the mode of travel one uses, are not the deciding factors in whether or not one yields to temptation or overcomes evil and leads a life of righteousness. That is dependent upon the manner in which one meets disappointments and sorrows, on the inward growth one achieves through the exercise of faith, of moral courage, and of love. Ninety-nine years have passed since the entrance of the first pioneers into the valleys of the mountains. Those pioneers have all departed from this scene of existence with their great work accomplished. Unknown now are the physical perils and dangers of that earlier day; however, the spirit of pioneering continues to burn bright in Latter-day Saints who have had it bred in their bones and sinews by the strength and power of the gospel. EDITORIAL Latter-day Saints today pioneer in living according to Church standards in the midst of Babylon. Amid an orgy of waste and extravagance, they pioneer in frugality and saving. During an era of curtailed production and destruction, they pioneered in bounteous production and conservation. While idleness is being rewarded, they pioneer in earning their needs. At a time when evil forces strive to loosen and weaken family solidarity and family responsibility toward each other, they pioneer in loving care for their own, and even are setting forth 449 into an uncharted land seeking unselfishly to become their brothers' keepers. By ever following the call of divinely inspired leaders, Latter-day Saints will always be pioneers in traveling along a straight and narrow path, and as each generation emerges from the mountains of deception and worldly sophistries into the great valley of righteousness and the kingdom of heaven, it will pass on to its children the great pioneering heritage of its noble forefathers. M. C. S. Congratulations to Sister Augusta Winters G. Rant HE General Board of Relief Society, on behalf of its members in all the stakes and missions of the Church, takes this opportunity to congratulate Sister Augusta Winters Grant on her ninetieth birthday, July 7, 1946. It is with great appreciation for her fine example of Latter-day Saint womanhood, and for her years of service to the Church, that we pay tribute at this time. We are mindful of her devotion to our beloved President Heber J. Grant; we are grateful for the pattern of motherhood which she has set before us; and we rejoice that we are all heirs to the breadth and beauty of her spirit. Sister Grant, we wish you many happy returns of the day, and may you enjoy many more years in which to contribute the graciousness and the love which radiate from you to the women of the Church. ABUNDANCE Alice Morrey Bailey I find my life is filled with friends Too willing, far, to share, Who keep me ever in their debt? With God, who answers prayer, And, from my foolish asking, Gives too much for me to bear. NOTES TO THE FIELD New Courses of Study for 1946-47 IN presenting the courses of study for 1946-47, the General Board calls to the attention of Relief Society stake and mission officers two new courses which are being offered for optional use. The course on "Sewing" is intended for study on work meeting day by any ward or branch Relief Society, all or any part of whose members desire to learn the fundamentals of sewing. Such a course is offered in order to give every member of Relief Society an opportunity to learn how to sew, under helpful supervision. It is left optional with the individual ward or branch whether or not to undertake such a study, and also to set the time on work meeting day when the course is to be presented. In addition to the value which will accrue to individual Relief Society members from such a course, it is the hope of the General Board that the "Sewing" lessons will improve the styling, sizing, and sewing of clothing for the Church Welfare assignments. It should be kept in mind that the first responsibility for sewing to be done on work meeting day is to complete the Church Welfare budget assignment. This "Sewing" course should not in any way interfere with necessary Welfare or Relief Society sewing, = members who do not desire to participate in the "Sewing" course should not be asked to refrain from other sewing during the period of time devoted to the development of the monthly lesson on "Sewing." Wards and branches which adopt this course of study for use on work meeting day will offer to Latter-day Saint women a service which is fundamental to the responsibility of Relief Society; namely, to aid the women of the Church in improving their homemaking skills. By becoming proficient in the art of sewing, Relief Society members will prepare themselves to make clothing for their own families. The course "The Gospel as a Way of Life" is presented for optional use in stakes and missions which desire to study these lessons in place of the literature course "America as Revealed in Its Literature." The final decision as to which course a particular branch or ward will study, will rest with the respective Relief Society stake president or mission Relief Society president in consultation with the ward or branch Relief Society president. For further information in regard to these and the rest of the educational courses for 1946-47, see "Lesson Department" pages 472 to 504 in this issue of the Magazine. RESTORATION Grace D.

In the midst of so much radiant color, it is possible that the homemaker may forget some of the requirements for effective flower arrangements. She may use too many different kinds of flowers in the same bouquet; she may mass the blossoms too closely together; or she may not remember that beauty can be achieved by varying the design. Many of the summer flowers are too rich in color to be used without some type of contrast. White flowers, combined with colors, not only accentuate the radiance of the more ornate blossoms, but they also give to the arrangement a look of cool- " Ness and a light and graceful touch. Gypsophila (baby's breath), white daisies, and "snow on the mountain" are some of the daintier flowers that help to make summer bouquets attractive. Many homemakers use lightcolored figurines to accent the deep tones in summer flower arrangements. White vases and bowls, white doilies and table mats, also provide a pleasing contrast. Experiment with blossoms, containers, figurines, backgrounds, mats, and doilies, until you have obtained the flower arrangements that make you happy and add loveliness to your home. Grain for the Food of Man Eva Willes Wangsgaard HAT is earth's loveliest fragrance. According to a sailor who occupied our blue room during his interim between Farragut Naval Training Station and Harvard, it is the smell of baking bread.. A French baker spends many months learning the art of breadmaking, yet, with all our modern advantages, it is an art that any willing housewife can learn and derive a rich satisfaction in its practice. It is a comfortable feeling to know that there is good bread in the breadbox and fresh milk in the refrigerator. Cereal grains have been cultivated since early times. Among the Greeks and Romans, the cultivation of grain was a highly developed art. Such industry encouraged the settlement of towns, since grain is a food easily stored, and, without stored food, people lived as nomads following the game they used as food, or moving to better pastures for their sheep and cattle. The earliest cultivated grains were barley, wheat, and millet. Oats and rye came relatively late in man's development. Women took part in the farming and grinding as well as the breadmaking. Breadmaking has come a long way since the primitive peoples stored grain in crude, earthen jars and ate it raw or parched, or ground it into a coarse meal which they mixed with water and pressed into flat cakes which were dried in the sun or baked in the ashes. Such food has been Page 454 found among the ruins of the old Swiss lake dwellers and in the Egyptian tombs. Some people leavened _ their bread as long ago as 4,000 years. Their yeast was derived from air borne yeast spores. In the making of flour, the Romans progressed to the use of circular mills or querns operated by slave labor or beasts of burden. They also produced several grades of flour by means of sieving or bolting. Later, water wheels were used. The first querns were conical in shape, but were gradually changed to flattened stones, and these continued in general use throughout Europe and this country until 1870. With the advent of steam power and electric power, revolving pairs of rollers were invented and came into general use. This made possible the release of more of the floury kernel unmixed with fine bran and the germ, because of the more gradual breaking of the grains. Roller milling enabled the millers, especially of our Middle West, to make hard wheat into high quality flours. The milling of soft wheats, largely used for cake and pastry flours, was also improved by this process. And so these ancient arts of handling grain as part of the household tasks have developed into a highly technical modern industry. Maize, or Indian corn, sometimes called field corn, is considered native to the Americas. Traces of this grain have been unearthed in ancient Peruvian tombs, and the Indians in GRAIN FOR THE FOOD OF MAN many parts of the two continents cultivated it extensively. Our Pilgrim Fathers would have starved had they not been taught the virtues of corn as a food and been helped in its cultivation by the Indians of New England. Over one-half of the world's cultivated land is used for growing grain of one species or another. About four fifths of the earth's inhabitants prefer wheat or rice because these cereals are palatable, mild in flavor, and blend most successfully with other foods. Only for occasional use are the grains of stronger flavor, such as corn and rye; or they are used by peoples who have these grains in abundance, and to whom the more palatable ones are unavailable. The study of breadmaking is of no slight importance, and deserves more attention than it receives. Considering its great value, it is unnecessary, and even wrong, to find poor bread on any table. Wheat flour is best adapted for breadmaking as it contains gluten in the proper proportion to make the spongy dough necessary to retain the gas bubbles which create its lightness. Except for its slight deficiency in fat, wheat bread is a perfect food. It is this deficiency which led to the spreading of butter on our bread. Next to wheat flour, rye has the necessary gluten, but it is better used in combination with wheat flour. Corn, also, may be used in such combination. BREAD is made by mixing flour to a dough with a quantity of milk, or water and milk, or just water, along with salt and yeast. Sugar is often added to speed the rising. The mixture is kneaded until all 455 ingredients are blended into a smooth, resilient dough. Here is my stand-by recipe, which, if followed carefully, will produce bread of good texture and appetizing flavor. Yeast Bread 2 sifters all-purpose flour (sifted before measuring ), 1 qt. Whole milk, scalded and allowed to cool to tepid 2 tablespoons salt Ye cup sugar 1/8 Ib. Shortening 2 cakes brewer's yeast. Dissolve yeast in the warm milk into which the sugar has been stirred. It will tise and form a foamy mass on top. Sift salt and flour into a large bread pan and stir in the liquid gradually until all the flour has been moistened. Then knead until smooth and even. Well-kneaded dough will not stick to the pan unless it is allowed to become too warm. Cover, and wrap in a large dish towel or other cloth to help keep an even temperature. Stand the pan in a corner protected from drafts. It should double its bulk in three hours. If it is inconvenient to handle at this point, a little longer rising will not spoil the results. Push down and knead again thoroughly. This breaks up the bubbles and distributes the carbon dioxide evenly. Let rise again until double in bulk, about one hour. Push down, divide into three equal portions, mold carefully into loaves of uniform shape and size, place in well-greased loaf tins and set in protected place to rise. This time it must be watched carefully to prevent over rising which spoils the appearance and quality of the loaves and slices. While it rises, preheat the oven to 420?. When the loaves have risen even with the top of the loaf tins, or just below, place in the oven, turn the temperature to 375 or 400, and bake fifty minutes or one hour, depending upon the size of the loaves. This process may be considerably shortened by using more yeast, and the yeast cakes now available may be used without imparting an unsavory, yeasty taste to the bread. Also, the second rising may be omitted, but the handling of bread is 456 like the rearing of a child, if you want the finest results, don't try to hurry the process. This recipe may be used for the making of whole-wheat bread by substituting whole-wheat flour for half of the all-purpose flour. Also, brown sugar or molasses or honey may be used instead of white sugar in whole-wheat bread. Corn meal may be used for part of the flour, also, but since com has very little gluten, it should never exceed one third of the bulk. Raisins or finely chopped nuts may be kneaded into the dough either at the first kneading or, if only one loaf of "fancy" bread is desired, the fruit or nuts may be kneaded into the loaf at the time of molding. This takes time and patience, though, to get the materials evenly distributed in the resilient mixture. Part of the dough may be reserved for rolls, either plain or sweet. Roll the dough flat and cut with a biscuit cutter. Divide each biscuit partially by pressing the back of the knife across the middle of the dough. Put a spot of shortening on one half and fold the other over, pressing the edges firmly. Place on baking sheet to rise and put a cloth over the dough. If sweet rolls are desired, spread the rolled dough with shortening and sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon. Roll up like a blind and slice. Lay the slices on a baking sheet and Jet rise. These take longer in the rising than either bread or plain rolls. Rolls of both types should be baked in a hotter oven than that used for bread, 375 to 400 F. Before rolling, the dough for sweet rolls may be enriched by RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE JULY 1946 kneading a beaten egg into it, but the rolls are quite satisfactory without. Also, excellent bread may be made with warm water instead of milk, or with potato water, or with a liquid of half milk and half water, and without the use of shortening. However, if no shortening is used, a soft crust may be obtained by brushing the loaves with butter about ten minutes before removal from the oven. Golden Corn Bread 3/4 cup corn meal 11/4 cup flour 1/2 cup sugar 5 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 cup milk 1egg 1 or 2 tablespoons melted shortening Mix and sift dry ingredients; add milk, egg, well-beaten, and shortening. Bake in shallow greased pan in hot oven (400? F.) twenty minutes. Corn Bread (sweetened with molasses) 1 cup corn meal ?% cup flour 3/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup molasses 3/4 cup milk 1 beaten egg 1 tablespoon melted shortening Mix and bake as for Golden Corn Bread. Now, when famine conditions prevail over much of the world, when a large part of American wheat must be exported, it is more important than ever that we waste no cereals of any kind and that we use such substitutes as corn meal and other available cereals. About one-third mashed potatoes may be substituted for part of the flour in standard recipes. Rag Rug Weaving in Emigration Stake, Salt Lake City Lillie C. Adams President, Emigration Stake Relief Society This account of Tug weaving as carried out in Emigration Stake is typical of that activity in other stakes having a rug Weaving assignment as part of their Church Wel. Fare budget for 1946. THE Welfare assignment given Jl Emigration Stake Relief Society in January, included the weaving of 240 rag rugs. This was an innovation, a new experience. For this reason it seemed to us a rather difficult assignment. However, if we recall the achievements of our pioneer mothers, we will always be spurred on to enter into new fields of activity, ' In the accomplishment of any of our Welfare projects, the first question to be asked is, "Is there a need?" The next question may well be, "Does the Lord require it at our hands?" These two questions in regard to rug weaving were answered in the affirmative, because our Prophets today, led by God, have asked us to support wholeheartedly the Welfare Plan. Another requisite for the accomplishment of a project should be a prayerful attitude. Our prayers should be: "Father, we are willing to work. Show us the way, for we know the light comes to all who earnestly seek thee." We can be assured of his supporting and sustaining influence, for have we not read in I Nephi 3:7 I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them. Abraham Lincoln believed that it took both faith and works for any worthwhile accomplishment, for he said, "I pray as though all depended upon God, but I work as though everything depended upon myself." Now, may we tell you the procedure we followed in accomplishing our project of Tag Tug weaving? To locate a loom was the first essential. Through telephoning the Relief Society ward Presidents of the stake, we learned that a woman in one of the wards would rent us her loom. She was asked if she would Weave our rugs, but, fortunately for our development, she said that she was not able to do so on account of ill health, but would teach us the art. She proved to be a considerate, competent, and patient teacher. The next step was to find a place in which to set up the loom. The bishop of one of the wards kindly consented to have it placed in the Relief Society room of his ward. The afternoon the loom was set up and the warp put on, two rugs were woven. Eight pounds of tags had already been sewed, which made it Possible to weave the two Tugs. Page 457 458 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE JULY 1946 SISTER ETHEL L. GOATES OF THE THIRTEENTH WARD, EMIGRATION STAKE, AT THE LOOM That which is tangible intensifies interest, so these two rag rugs were taken to each ward to show what could be done. The next step was to find a sufficient supply of rags to use in the weaving of the rugs. Some of the bishops announced in the Sunday evening services that the Welfare Program required the collection of rags for rugs. The tags just rolled in on the following Tuesday which was Relief Society work meeting. Some of the brethren, even, carried sacks of rags to the Relief Society room to increase the supply. That very day the rooms were filled with busy women, tearing, cutting, and sewing rags. Those who could not see well enough to sew, wound into balls the rags which were already sewed, or cut or tore more rags. It required 4 pounds of sewed rags for each rug to measure 27x54 inches. It was deemed advisable to sew at least half the required weight of tags to fill a ward assignment before beginning to weave. As it took 160 pounds of rags to make forty rugs, therefore eighty pounds of rags were needed before beginning to weave, and the remaining half was sewed while the first part of the weaving progressed. The proper width to tear the rags depended upon the weight of the material. Thin rags torn about two inches wide, when twisted, rolled up to the size of a lead pencil. When sewing, the right side was placed to RUG WEAVING IN EMIGRATION STAKE the right side of the material, then the material was folded double be. Fore making the seam, and sewed. In order to save thread, the thread between the seams was not cut. This method enclosed the seams so that 0 Taw edges were left, and a smooth- 'T, neater rug was made. Before have no definite pattern, select Tags of colors which will blend harmoniously. Plain colors may be used for the center and the ends of the Tug may be bordered with Stripes of different colors. The pattern to be definitely planned and laid out before the Weaving is begun, f six or more women in a ward learn thoroughly the art of Weaving, struct another group of three or four women, thus eliminating the unequal task of having only a few participating. In each ward, select as many mechanically minded women as possible for the work of weaving, as difficulties do arise, and a little mechanical skill may be necessary for repairing the machine. Have a hammer, a pair of pliers, and some nails on hand. 459 It is important, when threading the machine, that as many observe the operation as Possible, because, when weaving, the warp may break. These women will then know how Manner similar is wound on a spool. Four of our wards have completed their rag Tug Weaving assignments and have handed in the Tugs at the Salt Lake Regional storehouse. Two themselves, and by so doing they can use? up materials that might otherwise be wasted and bring useful and beautiful articles into their homes, Through love, loyalty, diligence, C0-operation, consideration, and good works, our wonderful women of Emigration Stake have faithfully fulfilled their Tag rug assignments. ONE FAMILY Maude Blixt Trone Robert went to Washington, Harry went to sea, Kathryn went to Hollywood, And Grace to Italy, Claire stood on a windy hill And watched the dogwood blow, And felt a lifting of the heart: ? rest may never know, Faith Is a Heritage Christie Lund Coles CHAPTER 4 Synopsis: Enid Drage, wife of Tom Drage, who was killed in a. Factory accident, suddenly finds herself facing the future with a child and no means of support. She goes to her landlady, Miss Nobbitt, who tells her she need not worry about the rent. When Enid has almost decided to accept any type of work available, an attorney comes and tells her he wishes to speak to her. NID opened the door wider and invited the man to come in. As he did so, she hurriedly removed the clothes she had been mending from the rocker, and motioned him to sit in it. When he was seated, he began opening his brief case. "I'll get to the point as quickly as possible," he said. "The factory is prepared to make a fair settlement for your husband's death. It was most unfortunate. " She nodded. "Yes. Yes, it was. But this what do you mean?" He explained the technicalities, the legal reasons, behind the settlement; but, somehow, it didn't seem to register. She hadn't expected anything, hadn't even thought of it, though now she knew she should have expected something. The check he handed her was magnanimous. She knew it was right that the factory should do this, and she needed the money for herself and her child, yet, it seemed incredible that she should be taking money in exchange for Tom's life. Her instinct was to refuse it, to cry, "Oh, no. Nol" She forced herself to remain calm, Page 460 to take the check in her icy fingers. She even managed to whisper, "Thank you.-. Thank you very much." She signed the papers he asked her to sign, and he was gone again as swiftly as he had appeared. When her surprise and incredulity had subsided, she sat on in the darkness and a great sense of relief and of peace flooded over her. Now, there was no fear of being hungry, of being evicted from the apartment. Sharon could be taken care of. God was very good. Feeling now that she had a friend in Miss Nobbitt, the next morning Enid went to her door to tell her the good news. "And well they should make a settlement," the other woman said primly. Then, smiling, "Come in, my dear. This really helps doesn't it?" "Oh, yes. Now I can pay you the rent..." "The rent, fiddle-faddle. Now, you can make preparations for the future. This money won't last long. You must go back to school, get your degree to teach. Unless, of course, you intend to marry." "Oh, I don't.. Ever." "Ever is a long time. Know." Enid was hardly listening. Her soft, young forehead was suddenly creased with tiny, thoughtful lines. She murmured, "I should love to get my degree, but I'm tied here with Sharon. I couldn't leave her." And I FAITH IS A HERITAGE Miss Nobbitt's voice was tart, almost offended as she said, "Don't you suppose I could take good enough care of her?" Enid looked at her quickly, "Why of course you could. More than 800d enough. But | wouldn't think of asking you." "You're not asking me," her landlady assured her, "I'm asking you to let me. In fact, I'm insisting." Without stopping to think, Enid gave in to her instinct to Tush over and throw her arms about the tall, spindly woman, as she exclaimed, "You darling, you!" Miss Nobbitt squirmed, protesting irritably, "Oh, stop it." But Enid could see that she liked it. She could tell by the way her lower will have to decide whether I should ?0 to summer school two years or to college for the Tegular four quarters," ell, there's no hurry about your "Well, if you hurry maybe you can make it this summer." "This summer?" Enid asked, a little dismay in her voice, realizing that she would have to leave within a week or two. Sudden fear welled 461 over her. She looked at Miss Nobbitt imploringly, almost as if the woman Were passing sentence upon her and she was waiting for the verdict, NID did not speak. After all, been dead Such a There was no hurry. She couldn't bear to leave Sharon even though she knew she would have the best of care, Suddenly, Miss again, saying, "It's for your own ?00d, you know. This town isn't help you forget, will put a little flesh on your bones," Enid laughed, tremulously, "You should talk about flesh." The other woman continued, "You don't think I've heard you? crying in the night, walking the floor. Grief can destroy body and soul if one lets it" The girl wondered how nearly it 462 adorned, we begin to grow wise," Miss Nobbitt said. She turned, and Enid felt that the conversation was at an end. She started to leave. The other woman's voice stopped her, saying, softly, hesitantly, as if she did not know how to ask a favor, "Would you... Would you call me 'Manda'? That's my name, you know." "Why, yes, I'd love to. And Sharon can call you Aunt Manda. She will love that." "You think she will, really?" "Yes. I think she will... Really." SALT LAKE was much the same as Enid had remembered it. The summer was hot and the asphalt seemed to melt beneath her feet as she crossed the streets. At the university, however, it was comfortable. The buildings were not too hot and the campus was beautiful and cool. A breeze came from the mountains. The first day Enid climbed the hill, she had to keep her eyes averted while she passed the particular places where Tom and she had talked and laughed and found that exquisite, life-changing magic, love. Yet, as the days passed, she found that she could not only see the places, but she could pause there, could touch the very trees where his lean, young body had stood, where his fingers had touched the bark. Somehow, it gave her peace and joy. It made her feel older than her years, seeing the younger people, courting, laughing, and realizing that all of that was behind her, realizing that she had known motherhood, met tragedy and survived it, and that the future RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?JULY 1946 loomed rather frighteningly before her. It was on a Friday afternoon that she stopped near the tree where Tom had made his audacious proposal. She sat down upon the grass and opened one of her textbooks. It would be nice studying here, much nicer than in the one-room housekeeping apartment she had rented. She knew she must study hard so that she could get her credits. If she taught, she wanted to be a good teacher, one that the children would remember and perhaps even love as she had loved some of hers. But she would not start teaching until Sharon was in school, she could easily wait that long. The thought of her small, beautiful daughter sent loneliness, like a fever, through her body. She was so thankful that she had Sharon, so very, very thankful. Young people were passing, but she paid little attention to them. In fact, she did not even notice a group coming toward her until they paused and one of the girls said, "Hello," in a friendly voice. Enid looked up to see a girl who was in two of her classes and a couple of young men she had seen either in class or on the campus. "Hello," she greeted them in return, "believe it or not, I'm trying to study." The other girl, whose name, she remembered now, was Laura, laughed, "It's too nice to be studying here. Why not come with us down to the corner for a malted milk. You remember Milo here, don't you, and Sam Thurston?" Enid nodded, "I've seen them. I'm not very good at remembering names." FAITH IS A HERITAGE Milo, a rather slight young man about her own age, said, "I wish you'd come." She hesitated a moment while she assured herself it was quite all right. She couldn't be alone always. She smiled at him, murmuring, "Why not?" She was surprised how pleasant it was to fall in with their light talk, to laugh at inconsequential things, to eat a double-thick malted milk from a high stool. Pleasant, yet somehow unreal, as if it were someone else instead of herself. When they had finished with the malts, Milo said he would drive them home. All four got into his smart, blue roadster. Laura and Sam got out at Laura's home, and Milo smiled down at her, "Like to take a ride?" "Well.. It would be nice. If you wish.." "I certainly do wish. Many things." She noticed his clothes, his shoes, the make of his car. They all told her he had money. More than that, 463 the rather sulky set of his mouth, the weak line of his chin, told her he had been spoiled. Yet, he was entertaining, as they drove toward the mountains. Dusk was falling over the city as he stopped the car on the road leading to Parley's Canyon. "Some view from here," he told her. "That's the lake over there." "It looks like a great, beautiful jewel," she exclaimed, thrilled, as she had always been, by the beautiful valley surrounded by mountains. "It isn't as bright as your eyes," he told her. And she laughed, "Don't be silly." "I'm not silly," he insisted, slipping his arm about her shoulders, "You're extremely pretty. Why don't you stop acting as if you had to cram for dear life to finish this schooling." She looked up at him in surprise. "Do I?" She asked. He did not answer her, instead he leaned his face over hers, came closer. She knew he was going to kiss her.

Asked him why he had thus attacked us, as we were their friends. He said that he saw the smoke from our fires in the morning and thought it was the Crows, who are enemies of the Sioux. He said he was sorry that they had made such a mistake and that our animals should be returned. Some of the brethren went up to the Indian village... And the chief sent out into the hills for our horses.. They brought them all but two (one of my mules and a fine mare belonging to Brother Chesley). The chief said they would be sent to Fort Laramie. He pretended they could not find them. We saw some of the horses among these Indians that had been stolen from us at Strawberry Creek (Ibid, page 85). RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?JULY 1946 The Settlement of Sanpete Valley (Continued from page 445) world by the Sanpete Valley Railroad extending from Nephi through Salt Creek Canyon to Wales. This railroad was built, primarily, to reach the pioneer coal fields of Sanpete County which had been located in 1859, and which were, at the time the railroad was constructed, the only source of coal supply in Utah. During the years 1890 and 1891, the Rio Grande Westen Railway was extended through the entire County, from north to south, connecting all of the larger towns. The railroads opened the dormant channels of trade, established postal and express services, and placed all the settlements of the Valley on the great highway of commercial prosperity. The pioneering era had come to a close. Now, the beautiful Valley, with its high eastern mountains, its western hills, its clear streams, and wide fields, faces the future. Many of its young men and women have returned from the service of their country. Some are being called on missions. Others are establishing homes in the Valley. The beautiful temple, on its high hill, is an inspiration to all who see it. Travelers look upon the edifice with wonder, but the people of Sanpete Valley, who know its history, and the history of the pioneers, look upon it with reverence and great pride. ACRES OF WHEAT Gene Romolo Acres of wheat, yellow-ripe for the reaping, Acres of wheat to be garnered and sheaved And powdered by mills into flour for keeping A leash upon hunger and peace among nations; Acres of wheat to be leavened and kneaded Into thousands of loaves. Every farmer whose hands Have wheat-seeded acres and watered and weeded Those-acres with vigor and patience and skill, Has shared with the Lord in the work of creation And leaned from fruition the power of will.

Brother Taylor became one of the his appointment to the First Council of Seventy member of the Service Men's Committee. John H. Taylor was the grandson of President John Taylor, third President of the Church. He was the father of Lucy Taylor Andersen, of the Y. W. M. LA. General presidency, and of Heber G. Taylor. His life has been shared, his service has been encouraged, and in all his goings and comings he has been blessed by the loyal, devoted, and intelligent companionship of his be. Loved wife, Rachel Grant Taylor. John H - Taylor was a man of lovable character; cultured, appreciative of the arts, considerate of his fellow men, in his judgment, a gentleman. In every sense of the true meaning of who had an unwavering conviction of ultimate realities, In his life he gave faith and courage, comfort and understanding to all who came within the sphere of his influence.

Sister Ross explains, "We have earnestly tned to follow the admonition 'He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none' (Luke 3:11). Since most of the women in our Society have jobs outside their homes, we feel that we have had unusual success in our charitable efforts. There are only five families who live here permanently. The other members of our group are university students who stay with us a year or so.

PLEASE, GOD Edna S. Dustin Let me not be a teen-age travesty Holding tenaciously to youth. Instead, Let me relinquish those years graciously And hold with pride my platinum coiffured head, With tendril faith still shining in my eyes, With tip-toe eagerness, but feet well shod; Let me untie the ribbons of each day's surprise And leave my outgrown years to youth, dear God. Notes on the Authors of the Lessons Leone G. Layton Member, Relief Society General Board In answer to numerous requests from readers of the Magazine, the following information concerning the writers of Relief Society lessons for 1946-47 is presented: LDER HOWARD R. DRIGGS has contributed from the richness of his active mind and the wealth of long scholastic training to the preparation of the Relief Society literature lessons of the past few years: "The Bible as Literature"; "(New Testament Literature"; and the present course, "America as Revealed in Its Literature." He has used no textbook for these courses, because, in writing them, he has pioneered the way, keeping in mind the particular needs and interests of Latter-day Saint women. Born in Pleasant Grove, the son of Benjamin W. And Rosalia Cox Driggs, Elder Driggs pays tribute to the influence of such pioneer teachers as William M. Stewart, Augusta Winters Grant, and Rose Brown Hayes. After his graduation from Brigham Young University, Howard R. Driggs began his teaching career in Pleasant Grove. Later, he graduated from the University of Utah in the same class with President David O. McKay, and that same year he became instructor in English at the Branch Normal School at Cedar City. After attending the University of Chicago, he became instructor, and, later, professor of English at. The. University of Utah. He held the same position in New York University, from which institution he received his Ph. D. Degree, and where he is now professor emeritus of English. Elder Driggs has always been active in the Church, serving as a president of the Mutual Improvement Association, a Sunday School superintendent, stake board member, president of the Manhattan (New York) Branch, and member of the New York Stake high council. For many years he has been a member of the Deseret Sunday School Union Board. Elder Driggs has also served as president of the Library-Gymnasium Commission of Utah, and is now president of the Pioneer Trails Association and the Horace Mann League of the United States. He has written more than thirty books, mainly on English and the story of America's making. His latest book, now being published, is The Master's Art? An Activity Course in Gospel Teaching. ELDER H. WAYNE DRIGGS, the son of Howard R. Driggs and Eva May Frampton Driggs, is a man of many talents, interests, and accomplishments. His devoted and meticulous study of the history of Page 469 470 the Church has eminently qualified him to prepare the course "Church History" for 1944-1947. He is also the author of "Stories From the Book of Mormon," 1943-1944. Elder Driggs has studied at Columbia and New York universities, and holds the degree of doctor of philosophy. He has taught English and sociology in junior and senior high schools in Utah and New Jersey, and has been a professor of education at New York University, professor of English and director of English education at Brigham Young University, head of the department of English at New York State Teacher's College, and is at present director of the Branch Agricultural College at Cedar City, Utah. Elder Driggs has always been active in the church, and has generously contributed his talents in the field of writing. His pageant ? America's Witness of Christ ? was produced each summer from 1937 to 1941 on the Hill Cumorah before thousands of people. His Dramatic Approach to Teaching contains suggestions which have been highly praised by educators throughout the country. Elder Driggs is also a contributor to many educational journals. He is a member of the Horace Mann League and many other scholastic and honorary organizations. Elder Driggs owns and manages a fourteen-acre farm in Pleasant Grove, Utah, and with his wife, Susan Elizabeth Swenson Driggs, and their four sons, makes an enjoyable hobby of farming. FELDER T. EDGAR LYON, author of the Optional Lessons in RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?JULY 1946 Lieu of Literature, 1946-47?"The Gospel as a Way of Life" and author of ""The Restored Gospel Dispensation," 1941-1942, is an experienced teacher and a devoted missionary, and has a rich background from which to draw material. His many years of preaching the gospel in foreign countries and his inspiring instruction in the Latter-day Saint seminaries have broadened his outlook and increased his appreciation for the ideals of the Church. Brother Lyon was bom in Salt Lake City, the son of David R. And Mary C. Lyon. He attended the Latter-day Saint High School and was graduated from the University of Utah with a bachelor's degree. He also studied at Bingham Young University, the University of California, and received his master's degree from the University of Chicago. He has taught in Rigby (Idaho) High School, the Midway (Idaho) Seminary, Ricks College, and the Salt Lake City Institute of Religion. He has also served as a Sunday School and Mutual Improvement Association teacher, and is at present a member of the high council of East Mill Creek Stake (Utah). Brother Lyon served as a missionary in the Netherlands, and, before returning home, traveled in Europe, Egypt, Palestine, Syria, and Turkey. In 1933, he was called, with his wife, Hermana Forsberg Lyon, to return to the Netherlands and preside over that mission. Two of their six sons, twins, were born in Rotterdam. Relief Society women will enjoy the rare spiritual quality of Brother Lyon's lessons, and the breadth of his understanding and enthusiasm will be an inspiration to them. NOTES ON THE AUTHORS OF THE LESSONS ISTER AMY BROWN LYMAN, author of the visiting teachers' messages for 1946 - 47: "Our Pioneer Heritage: Pioneer Virtues," needs no introduction to the women of Relief Society, for she has worked with them for many years. Called to the General Board in 19009, she has served as a Board member, assistant general secretary, general secretary, general secretary-treasurer, first counselor in the general presidency, and as general president. She has seen the organization grow in scope and influence, and has been instrumental in directing that growth. Through her desire to render broader service to the Society, Sister Lyman has taken special training in social welfare work and she has given years of service in this field, receiving national and international recognition for her outstanding achievements. Active in civic welfare, Amy Lyman has been a member of the House of Representatives in the Utah State Legislature, and has served on numerous committees devoted to the social betterment of humanity. From her wide experience and 471 extensive travel, she has gathered many rich treasures of thought and a fund of interesting stories about famous people with whom she has been privileged to associate. In her childhood home, many of the early pioneers visited with her parents, John Brown, who led the Mississippi saints to Pueblo in 1846, and Margaret Zimmerman Brown. From them she heard many inspiring stories of Church history. Sister Lyman has always been a champion of the visiting teachers' program of the Relief Society. She understands its purposes and is aware of the great possibilities for good within it. We are sure that the visiting teachers will enjoy carrying the messages prepared by Sister Lyman into the homes of the Latter-day Saints. Note: For other references to President Amy Brown Lyman, see: Annie Wells Cannon: "Amy Brown Lyman," Relief Society Magazine, January 1940, pp. 3-6; "In Retrospect," January through December 1942; President Belle S. Spafford: "Amy Brown Lyman," Relief Society Magazine, May 1945, pp. 269- 271. DESERT BEAUTY Ethel VanHook Hopper Driving through a desert town Where growing things were scorched and brown, I saw beside a heaped-up load Of sagebrush on a dusty road, A woman in the heat and glare, With faded dress and wind-blown hair; She clutched white blossoms in her hand? Where had she found in this bare land Such beauty? Could the desert give These flowers that helped her soul to live I smiled she glanced with pleased surprise; What gratitude in those pale eyes! E} DEPARTMENT Suggestions and Instructions on the Educational Program?1946-47 COURSES for the coming educational year, 1946-47, October through May, are as follows: Theology ? "Church History" (Third and final year). Visiting Teachers' Messages  "Our Pioneer Heritage: Pioneer Virtues." Sewing A course in the fundamentals of sewing, optional for use by wards and branches. (See "Notes to the Field," page 450 of this issue of the Magazine for instructions to Relief Society officers. ) Literature America as Revealed in Its Literature." Optional Lessons in Lieu of Literature The Gospel as a Way of Life." (Instructions concerning the selection of one or the other of these two courses for the third Tuesday of each month may be found in "Notes to the Field," page 450 of this issue of the Magazine.) Social Science �The Family in the Gospel Plan." The aim of the courses to be given in Relief Society during the season 1946-47 is to make Relief Society members better Latter-day Saints, better mothers, and better citizens; and thus to strengthen the Latter-day Saint home. In order to accomplish these purposes, the General Board Page 472 presents lessons on Church doctrine; lessons in literature to interpret America as a land of freedom, calling attention to the need of upholding the Constitution of our land; lessons on fundamental concepts of Latter-day Saint family life; and simple lessons on sewing. The General Board feels that the diligent study of these various courses will give to Relief Society members a well-rounded development in matters essential to Latter-day Saint women in this day. Teaching in Relief Society Depending upon the skill of the teacher, many and varied methods of conducting a class period may be followed. All Relief Society teachers are not equally trained in teaching, and many fine teachers have not had professional training. The. Best teachers, however, are always eager to improve their methods and make more effective their teaching. It is of paramount importance, however highly skilled a teacher may be, that she teach in the spirit of the gospel and give prayerful and conscientious study to her lessons. In addition, however, to the preparation of the lesson by a teacher, she should present it in such a way as LESSON DEPARTMENT to awaken in the members of her class a wish to study and gain knowledge for themselves. This desired end may be obtained by a variety of methods by class participation either by an informal discussion, questions and answers, or by a more formal presentation such as a round table, panel discussion, etc., or by home study on the part of individual members. It is a great responsibility to undertake to teach a group of fellow Relief Society women. It is also a great privilege. From the hours of intensive study spent in preparation for each Relief Society lesson by a class leader, come intellectual growth and a greater understanding of the gospel. May each class leader in the coming season do her utmost to impart knowledge to her class members, and also awaken in them a desire to study and learn for themselves, so that the testimonies of all Relief Society members may be strengthened, and their lives be lived more in conformity with the principles of the gospel. Lesson titles and lesson aims for the entire year's courses of study are given in the previews, but these may be subject to change. Correspondence on Lessons Ward class leaders who desire help on any matter pertaining to a lesson should consult their stake leaders. Stake leaders desiring information may address such correspondence to General Board of Relief Society, 28 Bishop's Building, Salt Lake City 1, Utah. It is not desirable to address communications either to the authors of the lessons or to any other Church office. 473 Textbooks and Special References Textbooks should be supplied for the use of the respective class leaders from the funds of the Society. On the completion of the courses in May 1947, it is suggested that the counselor in charge of education see that all books bought during the year by Relief Society funds are collected and placed in the Relief Society library for future use. Many books which have been used in Relief Society in past years (such as The American Citizen's Handbook, in use by Relief Societies for the social science lessons in 1942-43, which will supply supplementary material for the literature course "America as Revealed in Its Literature" for 1946- 47) will be found of great worth in preparing the current year's lessons. It is important that books bought by Relief Society through the years be carefully preserved for future reference. Textbooks for courses for the year 1946-47 are as follows: Theology: Doctrine and Covenants, $1.00; Smith, Joseph Fielding: Essentials in Church History, $2.00. Sewing (Optional course for work meeting): The Complete Book of Sewing, Book Presentations, New York, 1943, $2.95.: These textbooks may be obtained from the Deseret Book Company, 44 East South Temple, Salt Lake City 10, Utah. A list of books to which references are made in the current year's lessons, and which will prove of lasting worth in a Relief Society library, follows: Standard Works of the Church Bible Book of Mormon Doctrine and Covenants Pearl of Great Price 474 Books by Latter-day Saint writers on Church subjects, referred to in Relief Society lessons for 1946-47: A Story to Tell, published by Sunday School and Primary (includes pioneer stories) Bowen, Albert E.: Constancy Amid Change Discourses of Brigham Young.

Wayne Driggs Preview of Lessons for 1946-47 A PREVIEW of the third and final year's course of study entitled "Church History" introduces the lessons for 1946-47. 'Titles for the last eight lessons and their objectives follow below. It will be remembered that the central theme for the course is to be found in the Savior's words, "By their fruits ye shall know them." Again we shall look at the fruits of Mormonism and find them good. By way of review we may summarize the three parts of the course once more. Part I for 1944-45 was devoted to the opening dispensation of the fulness of times and had as its objective the mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the coming of the "church out of the wilderness"'; Part II for 1945-46 outlines the story of the saints in their movement to "the place which God prepared" in the tops of the everlasting mountains; Part III for 1946-47 pertains to the coming-of-age period of the Church with its broadened activities meeting the swift sweep of our modern times. The main objective of the course is to narrate the more important events of Church history and to consider the revelations in their relation to the historical episodes. We revere the revelations contained in the book of the Doctrine and Covenant as the revealed word of God for our day. The titles of the eight lessons for this year's course follow: LESSON DEPARTMENT Lesson 17. The Organized Church Moves Forward Objective: To indicate how the expand. Ing functions and offices in the Restored Church developed, Lesson 18. The Priesthood Quorums Expanded: Objective To show how the worthy male membership of the Church is eligible to receive the powers and blessings of the Priesthood. Lesson 19. The Relief Society Developed Objective: To trace the steps which developed an organization to provide for the growth and joy of women in service. Lesson 20, Educational System Developed Objective: Objective: To show that God would have his children seek after all that is good. Lesson 21: More Auxiliary Organization of the Church Started Objective: To study how the Sunday School, the Mutual Improvement Association, and the Primary organization were soon given place to aid in the Church training program for youth. Lesson 22. The Welfare Plan Initiated Objective: To show how the Lord is helping his saints to face the problems of our day. Lesson 23. Unsung Heroes in Zion's Cause Objective: To appreciate the countless unheralded men and women who have stood firm within the Church to move forward the work of the Lord. Lesson 24. Over a Century oi Mormonism Objective: To review, in brief, the ushering in of the last and greatest dispensation� the fulness of times � and to point out what still lies ahead. In this concluding series of the Church history lessons, there will be  need for supplementary reading material in addition to the Doctrine and Covenants and Essentials in Church History, the textbook for his course. Handbooks of instruction for the Priesthood quorums, the Relief Society, the Mutual Improvement and Primary Associations, the Sunday School and the Welfare Plan should be available. These need not be purchased, since copies are always at hand with appointed officers of the auxiliary organizations of the wards and branches of the Church. Do not lose sight of the place of the Doctrine and Covenants in this study. Here, the words you will read are the words of the Lord which ever illuminate the enduring principles of life. Through all the study let us not forget our repeating phrase from lesson to lesson� we must ''give heed unto his word" which has been written especially for us in this day. As to the method of class discussion, bear the following in mind: Somehow, in too many lessons, practically all o f the material is given in the written lesson itself. The teacher covers this part fairly well. When, however, she reaches the discussion period, she poses questions that draw a weak response. To this she must then supplement her own contribution. In overcoming such difficulty, there is the necessity of putting real content into the discussion period. In the case of the present series, this is done by directing class members to the words of the Lord as recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants. Once a class, after attempting to answer a simple but searching question, is turned to the 476 clear and convincing facts as phrased by the Master, hearts are warmed; and minds, seeking ready confirmation of truth, recall personal illustrations which press for expression. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE JULY 1946 Testimonies result, and the teacher assumes her rightful role as director, rather than taskmaster of the hour. Lesson 17 The Organized Church Moves Forward For Tuesday, October 1, 1946 Objective: To indicate how the expanding functions and offices in the restored Church developed. THE might of a great people is measured collectively. Upon the group as a whole, rather than upon its individual members, must the ultimate worth of a cause be known. It has been significant throughout the story of the rise of the Latter-day Saints that the Lord, in speaking of his Church, has always done so in plural terms. The promise given for the keeping of the Word of Wisdom, for example, reads, "And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings..." (Doc. And Cov. 89:18), not, and each saint who keeps these sayings. This is a significant fact both for the development of the Church, as well as for the good of each individual member, ~ for therein lies a strength twofold. By directing his promises for good living to the saints, the Lord, in effect, says, align yourself with my people and their cause, and you may be assured of the ultimate triumph of good. Something happens to one when such a promise is given. Desire to hold fast is strengthened, and within the heart rests the comfort of those eternal values that remain amid a world of change. What better way could God be forever calling his children into line! In our study of Church history the past two years, many and varied have been the shifting scenes that have depicted the rise of a mighty people ? the modern Israel. At times, when the dark clouds of oppression blackened the skies, it must have seemed to those who suffered most in the beginning years, that the promises of the Lord might come to naught. Had it not been for that enduring faith kindled eternally within the hearts of his most stalwart saints, certainly there could have been no rise of a nation of men and women who came from the far corners of the earth to bring again Zion in the last days. But now, as we look back over the history of the Church for a hundred years and more, we must feel that the world, too, will come to realize how great was that first vision of the boy prophet, Joseph Smith, that spring morning in the year of 1820. Yes, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has come of age. No longer need her people rest solely upon the revealed word of the Lord to sustain and defend their cause. Literally, within the lives and deeds of thousands and thousands of worthy saints, there rests the living testimony of a great work. These people are the fruits of the good tree. They are they whose lives become the pattern by which one may know the truth. And now, for those of us who LESSON DEPARTMENT have grown into the grove of good trees of the third, fourth, and even the fifth generation, let us take stock of our rich heritage in order to more fully appreciate the expanding function of the modern restored Church of our day. Its roots are deep, its foundation secure, its plan for the perfecting of the saints certain. Within the years of the more than a century since the first vision of Joseph Smith, many and wonderful have been the accomplishments of the modern Israel. These, if marked off in decades, May suggest, chronologically, some of the more important high lights of the Church events we have been studying during this course in Church history. Considered in connection with Latter-day Saint beliefs, as these have been Stated in the Articles of Faith, the Student of history may see how the guiding principles 20f Mormonism have been translated] into action and accomplishment. 1820?Year of the First Vision God not only spoke from the heavens, but saw fit to appear personally in company with his Only Begotten Son. Years later, the Prophet wrote, "We believe in God the Eternal Father, and in His Son Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost." From the personal know]- edge of sight as well as hearing, Joseph placed with conviction each comma and conjunction in that sentence. God lives! He does speak! He can answer Prayer! He does direct his work to bring about the eternal life of man! Here is the firm foundation upon which the Church of Jesus Christ now rests, 477 1830?Year of Organization of the Church According to the laws of the State of New York and the nation of which it is a part, this religious body came into being. Since that day and as a result of the revelations given to the Prophet, there is upon the earth the same organization "that existed in the Primitive Church viz: apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, etc." 1840 Year of the Incorporation of the City of Nauvoo The most inspiring structure in the mother of Mormon towns Nauvoo the Beautiful was the temple. It was the second such to be erected in the dispensation of the fulness of times, Inspired and blessed by the revelations God had already given his saints in Kirtland, the people of his choice now knew for a certainty the power of "the gift of tongues, Prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues." Everywhere, the peace of beautiful homes and thriving industries made Nauvoo a haven of though, had seen the bitter darkness that lay just ahead for him and his people, even as he then stood radiant in the shafts of sunlight that pierced the thickly darkening clouds. 1850 Year of Territorial Organization of Utah When the Prophet saw in vision the saints as a mighty people in the heart of the Rocky Mountains, he set their thinking toward scriptural 478 fulfillment of the prophecies of Zion redeemed. Later he wrote as the tenth articles of faith, "We believe.. That Zion will be built upon this (the American) continent." President Brigham Young, who led the Church in the beginning days of the fulfillment of these prophecies, saw the need for a new land under the control of democratic, constitutional freedom such as the founding fathers of our nation envisioned. It was with joy, therefore, that he and the saints heralded the news of President Millard Fillmore's appointment of federal officers for the Territory of Utah, in September of 1850. Brigham Young thus became the governor of the Provisional State of Deseret. Zion of the Americas seemed nearer at hand. 1860 Departure of Johnston's Army from Utah The struggle for righteous living among the saints brought bitter opposition in all their journeyings, even to the outposts of civilization? the Rocky Mountains. Tenaciously they stated their right to worship freely as: follows, "We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may." The Johnston's army episode in Utah brought to an end the era of mobs and armed force. The army came to subdue rebellion, and left having found none.. Its departure marked the beginning of brighter days for the Church whose claim for the freedom of worship | still stands. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE JULY 1946 1870Stakes of Zion Organized (Nine in Number) The coming of the 1870's marked the organization of twenty stakes of Zion. From Bear Lake on the north to St. George on the south, President Young had set firmly these organizations for the Church. "The literal gathering of Israel" was well under way. Within the outer reaches of the Intermountain Empire were planted the secure posts of refuge for the growth and development of the saints. In seven years that followed the opening of this decade, eleven of the twenty stakes were organized, so that, by 1877, the year of Brigham Young's death, men and women from the far corners of the earth knew of the standard upon Zion's hilltop. 1880 Fiftieth Anniversary of the Organization of the Church President John Taylor, in the year of the Golden Jubilee, revived again an old custom of Israel as recorded in the twenty-fourth chapter of the Book of Leviticus. The year was to be one of forgiveness in the Church. Throughout the stakes of Zion the need of service to the less fortunate was stressed. It was a year of thankfulness and praise to the Lord. 1900 Fiftieth Anniversary of the Preaching of the Gospel in Scandinavia and Hawaii. Two oceans had been spanned by the dawning of the twentieth century. The good word of the gospel had gone over both. Truly, the search for honest souls had become world-wide. How real then to the saints became the words of the LESSON DEPARTMENT third article of faith, that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel." 1930 Year of the Centennial Celebration of the Church ? one hundred years of Mormonism was Portrayed in fitting word and song from Salt Lake City to the most remote branches of the mighty People rejoiced - and "hoped all things" for the greater days that lay ahead, Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggested readings given below, have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part of the text to discover wherein we must �give heed unto his word.� 1. Any man who would be truly great must first be humble. As it is with a single man, so it is with people. The great events of the first century of Mormonism came to pass because God found humble men in the world who would listen to his word. What are the  characteristics of t rue humility? Have read again in class, the whole of the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants, and note the parts for discussion which firmly uphold the qualities that have made our people great. 2. What historical events to be found in this lesson stand out for you as an illustration of the greatness of the Latterday Saints? Have members of the class discuss these in the light of the article of faith found therein. For further details of important Church events during the first century of Mormonism, refer to the appendix of Essentials in Church History, by Joseph Fielding Smith. Visiting Teachings� Messages-Our Pioneer Heritage President Amy Brown Lyman Preview of Lessons for 1946-47 "OUR PIONEER HERITAGE" is the general subject chosen for consideration in the Visiting teachers' department during the year 1046-47. Messages featuring pioneer virtues will be dwelt upon and will be discussed by the visiting teachers when making their monthly visits. These messages will be especially timely, appropriate, and interesting during this time� Utah's great centennial year� when the attention of members of the Church everywhere will be focused on the migration of the Latter-day Saints from Nauvoo, the City Beautiful, their trek across the dreary, uncharted plains, their dramatic entrance into their "Land of Promise," and their struggles to colonize a new, parched and barren wilderness. Of this migration the historian Bancroft says: There is no parallel in the world's history to this migration from Nauvoo. The exodus from Egypt was from a heathen land, a land of idolators, to a fertile region designated by the Lord for his chosen people . . . The pilgrim fathers in fleeing to America came from a bigoted people � a people making few pretentions to civil or religious liberty . . . Before this [migration] the Mormons had [already] been driven to the outskirts of civilization, where they had built themselves a city; this they must now abandon, and throw themselves upon the mercy of savages... (Bancroft's History of Utah, page 217). In our discussions and considerations we shall keep in mind, in addition to our 1847 pioneers, those who came in successive companies during the two decades which preceded the completion of the railroad to Salt Lake Valley, and also those other pioneers who settled in the outlying sections of Utah and in the adjoining states, and who demonstrated the same faith and courage, and experienced similar hardships and trials. We shall also remember the brave and courageous women the wives and mothers, whose help, encouragement, and service were mighty factors in all the great triumphs and outstanding successes of those early days. As we think of the accomplishments, the virtues, and the debt of gratitude we owe our own pioneers, we are very naturally reminded that in every phase of human endeavor there have been those who had the vision, the courage, and the daring to look ahead and prepare the way for others to follow. To all such who have made constructive contributions to the welfare of mankind, the whole world is indebted. Among these are those who have so successfully led the way into fields of scientific invention and discovery, who have so greatly advanced conditions of health and education, and who have made mighty progress in the direction of improved human relations. Many of these great leaders have been misunderstood and unappreciated, some have been RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE JULY 1946 reviled and persecuted, while still others have been actual martyrs to a cause for which they had already previously sacrificed and suffered. Our ever-faithful visiting teachers will no doubt receive this assignment of subject matter for 1946-47 with great satisfaction and enthusiasm. Like all other Latter-day Saints, they love the stories of the pioneers. With many of these, they may already be familiar. But they will probably enjoy refreshing their memories and searching for further interesting historical data. Incidents connected with the journey and labors of our peerless pioneers will awaken renewed admiration for their faith and courage, their dauntless spirit and fortitude, and will increase in their descendants and all other members of the Church, appreciation for their outstanding virtues and their marvelous, if not actually miraculous, accomplishments. It is hoped that the visiting teachers in carrying these messages to the homes will so stimulate Church members that there will be a revived interest in the lives and labors of the mighty men and women who were such important factors in the establishment of our great Western Empire; and cause Church members to seek to emulate the example set by the pioneers. Titles for the messages for the eight months follow: Lesson 1. Love of God Objective: To show that the pioneers had a fundamental love of God, shown in their simple obedience to the principles of his truth. Lesson 2. Love of Fellow Man Objective: To show that the pioneers LESSON DEPARTMENT possessed the qualities of character necessary to live the "second great commandment," love of neighbor. Lesson 3. Faith Objective: To show that the pioneers recognized and practiced the first principle of revealed religion, namely, faith ?faith in God, faith in their leaders, faith in one another, and faith in a great cause. Lesson 4. Courage Objective: To show that courage, an outstanding virtue, was possessed by the pioneers; not alone courage to meet physical dangers, but also courage to meet spiritual pitfalls. Lesson 5. Industry Objective: To acquaint the women with 48) the diligence and industry of the pioneers. Lesson 6. Self-Reliance Objective: To show that the pioneers were resourceful, creative, and _ self-reliant. Lesson 7. Dependability Objective: To understand more completely the great pioneer virtue ? dependability to show how the pioneers cherished honor in their dealings with their fellow men. Lesson 8. Thirst for Knowledge Objective: To inspire an appreciation in us of the pioneer thirst for knowledge, that urge to progress, that search for ultimate perfection. Lesson I Love of God For Tuesday, October 1, 1946 Objective: To show that the pioneers had a fundamental love of God, shown in their simple obedience to the principles of his truth. O the extent that man loves God, does he choose to keep the commandments of God. His love for his Maker is in a great measure proportionate to his desire and willingness to be obedient to divine laws and precepts, and to make personal sacrifices, when necessary, in order to conform to these laws and precepts. We read: If ye love me, keep my commandments. He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me.... If a man love me he will keep my words: and my Father will love him and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him (John 14:15, 21, 23). An outstanding example of a people united in their love of God, and in their faith in him is that of our pioneer forebears. For him and for the establishment of his kingdom, no sacrifice seemed too great. Like Job of old, they could say, "I know that my Redeemer liveth." They knew that he heard and answered prayers; that he came to earth and restored the gospel in these latter days; and that he commissioned the saints, through their Prophet, to help in the establishment of his Church and in spreading the glad tidings throughout the Church. 'To this cause they were committed. They loved the Lord and chose to be obedient to him in all things, even to leaving their dearly beloved city. Colonel Thomas L. Kane, the faithful and devoted friend of the saints, who called at Nauvoo in September 1846, reports the sad conditions he found after their departure. 482 I procured a skiff, and rowing across the river, landed at the chief wharf of the city. No one met me there. I looked and saw no one.... I walked through the solitary streets.... I went into empty workshops... No work people anywhere looked to know my errand... I could have supposed the people hidden in their houses, but the doors were unfastened; and when at last I timidly entered, I found dead ashes white upon the hearths,., Fields upon fields of heavy headed, yellow grain lay rotting ungathered upon the ground. No one was on hand to take in their rich harvest... And in and around the splendid temple which had been the chief object of my admiration, armed men were barracked, surrounded by their stacks of musketry and pieces of heavy ordnance. -. It was after nightfall when I was ready to cross the river on my return,... And I landed where a faint glimmering light invited me to steer. There among the dock RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?JULY 1946 and rushes, sheltered only by the darkness, with no roof between them and the sky, I came upon a crowd of several hundred human creatures... These were Mormons in Lee County, Iowa, in the 4th week of the month of September, in the year of our Lord 1846 (Whitney, Orson F., History of Utah, I, page 275). Love of God has been the activating principle in all the accomplishments of Latter-day Saints from the day of the organization of the Church to the present time. To the degree that Latter-day Saints love the Lord, as shown by their obedience to the counsel and admonitions of his leaders, will the Church go forward in this day and the Lord's work on earth be consummated. Meeting Sewing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting. See "Notes to the Field," page 450.) Work Meeting Committee, Velma N. Simonsen, Chairman Preview of Lessons for 1946-47 SEWING is quite properly spoken of as an art. It is an art in that it is a form of creative expression. The woman who sews finds relaxation in her work just as the painter does in his canvas or the writer does in his manuscript. Sewing is a practical art and should have a place in every woman's life. We have mothers in our own Society who are unable to lower the hems of their children's skirts, and who must hire a seamstress to do even the smallest of sewing tasks. This should not be so. Every girl should know the simple fundamentals of home sewing both as a convenience and also for economy's sake. When a person learns to sew she also discovers a new use for her hands and her leisure time, and the satisfaction she feels in the completed article is an experience she will want to repeat again and again. An assignment has been given to the Relief Society to stimulate, in the women of the Church, a keener interest and greater activity in some of the neglected arts of homemaking. Therefore, we are presenting a simple course in the fundamentals of home sewing. These lessons will LESSON DEPARTMENT be outlined in the Magazine for study in the months October through May. It is optional with each ward or branch whether or not it will adopt this course. (See "Notes to the Field," page 450.) While it is doubtful if, in any ward or branch, every member of the Relief Society would wish to participate in this dressmaking course, it is the hope that in every ward and branch there will be some who will desire to study it. 'Those not participating in the sewing course may go right on with the other activities of the work meeting. The day should be kept friendly and informal. Welfare sewing, of course, is the first responsibility for work meeting and this optional sewing course should in no way interfere with this assignment. These lessons, it is felt, can be used to advantage in raising the standard of the welfare sewing, as well as giving assistance to the inexperienced sewer in the making of her own and her children's clothing. They will give the experienced sewer an opportunity to render real service by assisting those less experienced and, at the same time, give some help, even to more experienced sewers, by offering simple, time-saving, professional methods of sewing. The teachers chosen for this course need not be experts or professional seamstresses. Any member of the Relief Society who is experienced in practical home sewing will be able to interpret the outlines and teach the fundamentals of this course. The sewing course is planned to be simple and applicable, covering 483 each step from the thimble to the finished article. Lessons in technique and practical application of principles will alternate. We hope, at the close of the season, a fashion show or an exhibit may be held, at which time the women may model and exhibit the clothes they have made during the Relief Society season. It is the hope that each ward and branch Relief Society will do everything possible to stimulate attendance at work meetings, and inspire an ambition in each member to make at least one article of clothing during the year, in addition to the service she will render the Society as such. The titles for the eight lessons follow: Lesson 1. Choosing Right Clothes Special attention will be given to colors, fabrics, basic styles, and lines. Lesson 2. Use of Tools and Treatment of Materials Lesson 3. Measuring Commercial patterns will be interpreted and adjusted to individual measurements and cutting. Lesson 4. Stitches Different kinds of bastings and uses and treatment of raw edges and seams will be demonstrated. Lesson 5. Pinning, Basting, Fitting, Pressing Lesson 6. Button Holes, Fastencrs Lesson Finishing, 'Trimming, Collars, Bands, Hems and Pockets Lesson 8. Exhibit or Fashion Show A display of articles made during Relief Society season will be shown. The textbook recommended for use is The Complete Book of Sewing. 484 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE JULY 1946 Lesson I Choosing the Right Clothes For Tuesday, October 8, 1946 Women were made to give our eyes delight A female sloven is an odious sight. 'Tis woman's duty to be charmingly dressed. It is not a question of how much money she spends, but the intelligent manner in which she spends her money. If the fundamental principles of sewing and good grooming are adhered to, a woman can be as correctly dressed in cotton as in silk or velvet. Every girl should be taught how to sew correctly and effectively. It is an accomplishment that is not only an economy but a means of attaining individuality and smartness, and one that brings rich rewards in relaxation and satisfaction. A wardrobe made by an individual may be twice as extensive as one purchased ready made. The first step in dressmaking is to choose the proper styles, fabrics, -and colors suitable to you and your personality. Study yourself in the mirror. It is your truest critic. Become familiar with your weak points Edward Young (early 18th century) as well as your strong points. Study your posture, your walk, your facial expression, and your hair-do. Comb your hair in various ways and choose the most becoming style. Accent your attractive features. You can give the illusion of gaining inches in height and losing pounds in weight through the proper choice of styles. Don't be afraid of changing your styles. Colors that were not becoming to you at twenty may be best for you at forty, and visa versa. Learn to be individual; never copy another person. The clever clothes worn by someone else may appear dowdy and unattractive on you. Suggestions to Class Leaders: Bring materials of different colors, patterns, and textures. Drape them on women of different types for good or bad effects. Experiment with different necklines. Textbook References: The Complete Book of Sewing, Book Presentations, N. Y. 1943, I and II. Line  As Revealed in its Literature Elder Howard R. Driggs Preview of Lessons for 1946-47 HISTORY tells what man has done; literature reflects how he felt about it. Within the songs, stories, orations, drama, and other types of creative expression may be felt the heartthrobs of a people. If these creations are in consonance with fact; if they are true to life, and particularly if they are true to truth, they help make of history a living reality. Our central purpose in this series of studies is to discover and enjoy literature that "rings true" to the inner spirit of America. This means an alluring search for the gold nuggets that lie in the common sand and gravel. It means a careful testing LESSON DEPARTMENT of literary selections to separate the true from the false to find that which is soundly based on the fundamental principles of real Americanism.. These principles are rooted in true religion. Our nation, someone has said, was Bible-born. Certain it is that literature which truly reflects its inmost spirit is soundly democratic in the highest sense is in accord with the spirit of true Christianity. We shall do well to discover and foster such upbuilding literature. It is protective and patriotic to do so.. In carrying forward this important study, a series of lessons covering two years' work is planned. During the first year, the unfolding epic of America, viewed in the high lights of its literature, will be presented. For the second year, a more intensive study of chosen types of truly American literature will be made. From such lessons, rich in content and systematically followed, should come a clearer vision of America as our founding fathers began it, and as our pioneers carried it "from sea to shining sea." Here is a wealth of good reading and spiritual uplift. In offering it, there is clear realization of a vast, rich field. A temptation will be constant for teachers and students to stray away from the main road to alluring byways. This must be resisted if the goal a clearer understanding of America, and more devotion to this land of liberty is to be achieved. Let that beacon light be the guide, and rich rewards from the work will be won. Units of Study Lesson 1. Our American Indians in Literature 485 Inwoven with the epic of America's making in vital ways is the story of the red men. To get a more appreciative understanding of this colorful race the first Americans we know is the aim of this study. Better understanding of Indians, their nature, their admirable traits, their helpful contributions to our developing settlement and civilization, will come as worthy literature portraying Indian life and thought is studied. This may be found both in what expression we have from Indians themselves, and in that produced by authors who have caught something of their true nature and spirit. Latter-day Saints have a special interest and added knowledge and light for a deeper insight into this alluring theme. Lesson 2. Colonial Founders of America in Literature Columbus, led by inspiration, opened a new world. Following the great discoverer came folk of varied types seeking adventure, gold, and opportunity for greater freedom. So far as our own land is concerned, most of these liberty seekers wanted a place where they could worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience. This study will be centered mainly on these courageous, God-fearing souls who builded better than they knew. From them has come to us a heritage that grows richer with the passing years. Our part is to get closer to the Bible loving folk who dared the wide sea in their frail craft, and planted on the shores of our America their homes, their churches and schools. From some of these homes came many of the founders of our faith. Lesson 3. America's First War for Freedom in Literature Man's struggle for liberty a long, hard upclimb through the ages flames into brilliant reality during our Revolutionary War. Songs, stories, orations and essays truly expressive of this fighting epoch, will help bring its inner significance to us. This literature is vibrant with aspiration and courage of a people who visioned clearly their "inalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." To secure this right they went through the fires of testing conflict. It is a precious 486 heritage they have bequeathed to us one we should study with devotion. Lesson 4. Youthtime of a Nation Dedicated to Freedom Winning a war is one thing; winning a lasting peace is a sequence of as profound significance. In the story of the drafting and adopting of our Constitution, is drama of quiet intensity not often realized by those who live under its provisions and protection. The Lord has told us that this great charter of freedom is God-inspired. We shall do well to understand it better to get closer to the story of its making. Some of the literature to be studied in this unit will help achieve that result. Lesson 5. Westward March of America in Literature Widening of national horizons, adventures in charting new roads, carrying the 'White Man's Book of Heaven'' to the Indians, the important part of the Book of Mormon in shaping the destiny of the Farther West all will be given attention in this study. Following the war for freedom, which gave us a realm reaching from the Atlantic to the "Father of Waters," came the Louisiana Purchase, which extended our boundaries to the Rocky Mountains, and, after that, the frontier advancement to the shores of the Pacific. Our effort will be directed here to get closer to the spirit and meaning of this westward movement through such literature as portrays it truthfully. Lesson 6, Implanting American Civilization Across a Continent In the wake of the explorers and mountain men who charted our country, came the home builders. Settlers of the "blue grass' and Tennessee regions, of the "Land of the Lone Star," covered-wagon pioneers to Oregon and Utah are in this great drama. The California gold rush, the conquest of arid spaces, which added new stars to the flag, are among the stirring general scenes portrayed in the literature of the period. Choice stories, songs, and other types will be studied to help in the re-creating of this phase of the epic of America's making. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE JULY 1946 Lesson 7. America through Testing Years This study, centering on the period of struggle to abolish slavery and the holding of the Union, offers opportunity to get closer to the hearts of the people of both sides of the conflict. A wealth of literature, portraying the varied phases of old plantation days, songs, stories, drama, is available. Orations also, dealing with the serious problems of the times, and revealing the inner spirit and meaning of America, as a freedom-loving nation, mark this period. There is also an abundance of literature expressive of the heroism on both sides of the testing conflict, and its aftermath of peace with the Union preserved. Lesson 8. America Land of All Nations Lured by the spirit of liberty and by expanded opportunity, people of every clime have come to make America their home. Under our protecting flag and Constitution, those of honest purpose are learning the American way of life, and becoming honest, useful, co-operative citizens. Latter-day Saints, having in large measure been gathered from all the world, and those who are "honest in heart" having learned how to work unitedly for the up-building of God's kingdom on earth, are in a position to give understanding help to those struggling to adapt themselves to the new life in this land of freedom to self-government. Literature, offered in this study, will help bring us closer to the problem will guide us in assisting others as well as ourselves to work concertedly in promoting civic righteousness, in making this a land of God-fearing folk, such as it must be to continue a land of liberty. General References: First, a good history of our country. Such a volume will doubtless be found in most home libraries. Certainly one may be rather readily obtained from the texts used in high schools, or in a public library. Second, a good collection of poems portraying our history. One of the best we have found is Poems of American History ? Revised Edition, Burton E. LESSON DEPARTMENT Stevenson. This in shorter form ? American History in Verse-?by the same editor, will serve helpfully. Third, specific references to poetry, 487 fiction, drama, oratory, and other literature are given with each study. Most of these may be found in home, school, and public libraries. Lesson I Our American Indians in Literature For Tuesday, October 15, 1946 Ye who love a nation's legends, Love the ballads of a people, That like voices from afar off Call to us to pause and listen, Speak in tones so plain and childlike, Scarcely can the ear distinguish Whether they are sung or spoken? Listen to this Indian legend, To this Song of Hiawatha! Ye whose hearts are fresh and simple, Who have faith in God and Nature, Who believe that in all ages Every human heart is human, That in even savage bosoms There are longings, yearnings, strivings For the good they comprehend not, That the feeble hands and helpless, Groping blindly in the darkness, Touch God's right hand in that darkness, And are lifted up and strengthened? Listen to this simple story, To this Song of Hiawatha! "THESE lines from the introduction to a great epic portraying the true heart and spirit of the red men, strike a clear keynote for this study. Not only has the poet Longfellow preserved in this epic many precious legends created by the Indians themselves, but he has revealed what too many folk overlook in these children of the open spaces? their truly religious nature. It was from a student of Indian life, Schoolcraft, that the poet Longfellow obtained first hand _ stories and other materials out of which much of the poem, Hiawatha, was created. How well the work was done is attested by the fact that the epic has won approval from those of high rank among the Indians themselves. "We look upon it as our poem," an educated Indian lady told the writer in Oklahoma a few years ago. "Hiawatha is our national hero." Any study of literature portraying the Indian may well begin with an appreciative study of the "Song of Hiawatha." Like other great epics, it is a hero tale made of many tales centered in a dominant character. Fact and fancy are inwoven to bring out the deeds and qualities of the hero. Naturally, one might expect in a tale of this kind depicting Indian life and ideals, a warlike leader. On the contrary, Hiawatha is a great peace-loving, constructive chieftain. The poem, according to Longfellow, "4s grounded on a tradition prevalent among the North American Indians of a personage of miraculous birth, who was sent among them to clear their rivers, forests, fishing grounds, and to teach them the arts of peace." All the admirable qualities of courage, kindliness, physical prowess turned to goodly deeds were in his nature. As portrayed by the poet, Hiawatha, son of the Westwind and the Prairie Lily, who dies deserted, is reared by his grandmother, Nokomis. We see him in a natural, Indian childhood, watch his developing 488 youth. Then, after a testing combat with his father, ending in the sire's acknowledgement of wrong and in reconciliation with his son, Hiawatha is given his commission of service for his people. Following this comes "Hiawatha's Fasting" a practice of purification for Indian youth. In this story ls the legend of the bringing of Indian come a precious gift of food from the Great Spirit. Through his faith and his fasting Hiawatha finally sees the youth, Mondamin: Dressed in garments green and yellow, Coming through the purple twilight, Through the splendor of the sunset; Plumes of green bent o'er his forehead, And his hair was soft and golden. And to Hiawatha faint from fasting this youth says: I, the friend of man, Mondamin, Come to warn you and instruct you, How by struggle and by labor You shall gain what you have prayed for... Rise, O youth, and wrestle with me. Added details of the interesting legend will be found in the poem. Suffice it to say here, that out of this testing struggle came at last the Indian corn: And before the summer ended Stood the maize in all its beauty, With its shining robes about it, And its long, soft, yellow tresses; And in rapture Hiawatha Cried aloud, "It is Mondamin! Yes, the friend of man, Mondamin!" Then he called to old Nokomis And Iagoo, the great boaster, Showed them where the maize was growing, Told them of his wondrous vision, Of his wrestling and his triumph, Of his new gift to the nations, Which should be their food forever. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE JULY 1946 Added to this legend, others of significance are woven into the epic of Hiawatha. Within the lines of these stories is also something more ? interesting, descriptive touches portraying the life and customs of our Indians. We see, for example, how they built their graceful birchbark canoes, how they fished and hunted, how they were entertained round the fireside with stories by those, like old Iagoo, who knew how to tell them. Best remembered among the parts of the epic are those portraying the romance of the hero with the Arrow-maker's daughter, Minnehaha. In "Hiawatha's Wooing," the Indian courtship is pictured with artistry; in "Hiawatha's Wedding Feast," we are given a close view of the customs and joys of Indian life. A few lines will serve here as illustrative of the sweet wholesomeness with which the poet has told the story: As unto a bow the cord is, So unto the man is woman; Though she bends him, she obeys him, Though she draws him, yet she follows; Useless each without the other! Thus the youthful Hiawatha Said within himself and pondered,... Dreaming still of Minnehaha, Of the lovely Laughing Water, In the land of the Dacotahs. "Wed a maiden of your people," Warning, said the old Nokomis;... "Like a fire upon the hearthstone Is a neighbor's homely daughter, Like the starlight or the moonlight Is the handsomest of strangers!...' Then, with a grandmother's solicitude, she adds: "Bring not here a useless woman, Hands unskillful, feet unwilling; Bring a wife with nimble fingers, Heart and hand that move together, Feet that run on willing errands!" LESSON DEPARTMENT To which the smiling youth replies: "In the land of the Dacotahs Lives the Arrow-maker's daughter, Minnehaha, Laughing Water, Handsomest of all the women... She shall run upon your errands, Be your starlight, moonlight, firelight, Be the sunlight of my people!" Straightway, in his moccasins of magic, he goes to win this lovely girl. As he nears her home, he kills a red deer, flings it across his strong shoulders, and, reaching the tepee of the Arrow-maker, responds to the welcome that awaits him by laying the deer at the doorway. This is a symbol of not only his skill, but of his ability to provide for his household. Minnehaha, with the consent of her father, follows her lover back to his homeland. In "Hiawatha's Wedding Feast," we are given the welcome of the home folk. After feasting on typical Indian food, came typical entertainment. Characters who perform for the guests are Chibbabos, who sings "Onaway, Awake Beloved," a sweet Indian love song; Iagoo, who tells an Indian story; and Pau-Puk-Keewis, spirit of the stormwind, who dances the dizzying Beggars Dance. In all this we see and feel Indian spirit and life done by the creative touch of a great American poet. In "Blessing the Cornfields," we see the red men at peace, carrying forward their varied activities. A sacred ceremony in which Minnehaha plays the leading role is also portrayed. Another canto, "Picture Writing," shows something of their record keeping and symbolism, an art ascribed to their teacher, Hiawatha, who, legend has it: 489 In his wisdom taught the people All the mysteries of painting,... On the smooth bark of the birch-tree, On the white skin of the reindeer, On the grave-posts of the village. Days of difficulty and sorrow follow the times of peace. Friends of Hiawatha pass away. Troublemakers spread evil among his people. Finally comes hunger and disease with attendant tragedy. In "The Famine," we are given a most vivid portrayal of the sufferings visited upon the hero and his loved ones, and the passing of his heart's dearest Minnehaha. Poetic description of high artistry and deep feeling ? springing, it has been said, out of the loss of the author's own beloved wife is in this part of the epic. What follows is likewise of high quality, and of historical significance. In "The White Man's Foot," beginning with a sweet legend of the springtime, we are given also the story by Iagoo of the coming of the white men. The Indian folk all laugh derisively at the strange tale all but Hiawatha, who says: "True is all Iagoo tells us; I have seen it in a vision... Seen the people with white faces,.. From the regions of the morning,.. The Great Spirit, the Creator,. Sends them to us with his message." In the last of the cantos, "Hiawatha's Departure," the coming of the white man is portrayed. To the tribes of the northland, in which the poem has its main setting, it was the black-robe chief, the Jesuit missionary. Welcomed by the Indian leader, this stranger tells the assembled red men "the purport of his mission" and relates to them the 490 sacred story of the Savior, "how he fasted, prayed and labored" for the blessing and uplift of all. Hiawatha, commending the words to his people, takes the kindly stranger into his wigwam, gives him food and rest. Then, feeling that a new light has come for the red men, and that his work of uplift and blessing has been done, he quietly bids farewell to old Nokomis, and departs ?sailing westward in his magic canoe: To the regions of the home-wind,.. To the Islands of the Blessed, To the Kingdom of Ponemah, To the Land of the Hereafter! It is a parting similar in spirit to that of King Arthur and of other heroes round whom epics have been created. As with these other hero tales, more than just the story of a great character comes from reading the composite tale. In the epic is portrayed the life, the customs, the legends, the spiritual nature of the people. Another thing of import: To get the feel, the music, the pictures of Hiawatha and other hero tales, one must follow the advice of Longfellow: Lend to the rhyme of the poet The beauty of thy voice. In the simple repetitious lines of this Indian tale, is rhythm, cadence, charm. Words from the tongue of the red men lend themselves to expressive oral reading. Observe, for example, the musical beauty of lines such as these: In the vale of Tawasentha In the green and silent valley, Dwelt the singer Nawadaha. Round about the Indian village Spread the meadows and the cornfields, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?JULY 1946 And beyond them stood the forest, Stood the groves of singing pine-trees. Every line of the poem, indeed, and each of the Indian words used to give it color and atmosphere, has a musical quality. 'To read the choice stories and lyrics in it aloud is to get recreation of sweet, wholesome type, is to get closer to the true heart of our American Indian. Moreover, an appreciative study of Hiawatha gives a basic knowledge of Indian life for the evaluation and enjoyment of other well - written, wholesome portrayals of the red men. What we have been given through the years, too frequently, is pictures of this people as savages. Doubtless they did exhibit savage qualities many times; perhaps we should nave done the same had we been forced to meet as they did the sawtooth edge of a rather cruel civilization. Despite the ruthlessness of uncivilized whites who fought and plundered, however, we do get some remarkable examples, at times, of nobility, kindliness, and good sense from the Indian men and women whom the varied groups of Americans met in the settlement of this vast country. With such names as Squanto, friend of the Pilgrims; Pocahontas, who he'ped save John Smith and the Virginia adventurers; Sacajawea, Bird Weman of the Lewis and Clark expedition; Washakie, friend of the Utah pioneers, ever come stories that lift our thoughts of the Indian to higher levels. Fortunately, some of our writers of earlier days and new, have portrayed for us the better side of the red men at the same time not forgetting the other side for LESSON DEPARTMENT "there ate Indians and Indians," just as there are white men and white men. James Fennimore Cooper is one of the authors who has given us a fair appraisal of Indian character. Both sides of the picture are portrayed in his classic Leatherstocking Tales, He was close enough to the Indian life in the region of the "Fingerlake country" of old New York to gather materials for his creative work. Most widely known of his novels is Last of the Mohicans ?frequently studied in high school. One admirable character in that intriguing story is Uncas, a young chieftain of high quality. Another author who has left us a classic Indian story is Helen Hunt Jackson. In her Ramona, a tale of old California, she gives us a picture of Indian life and characters during the closing days of the old missions. Impact with unscrupulous whites in the wake of the "gold rush" brings tragic consequences to the red men. It is a theme that stirred the righteous ire not only of this fine American writer, but of many others who felt the wrongs heaped on an inoffensive folk. Our Indians, it should be ever remembered, are human beings. Appreciating this truth, and it should be comparatively easy for those schooled in the gospel as taught by the Latter-day Saints to do so, we shall better understand the soul of the Indian. An experience of the writer, that of co-operating with "Uncle Nick" Wilson in creating The White Indian Boy, brought a nearer view of the real red folk in their home life, their struggles for food and clothing, their affection 491 for children, and their other human traits. 'To live through those days that this Mormon boy actually did for two years of tepee life as the adopted son of Chief Washakie's another, is to learn the true heart of the Indian. Another book of recent creation by Frank Linderman will bring something of the same knowledge _this from the Indian himself. In American, a firsthand life story of Chief Plenty Coos, of the Crow tribe, we live the life of an Indian boy. His training, his fasting, his fighting, his life contacts with not only Indians but whites, are simply, convincingly portrayed in the volume. In various dramas the red men have been portrayed, not, however, as major but rather as minor characters. One of our writers, who fora time lived in Utah, Edwin Milton Royle, created in his play The Squaw Man such a drama of popular appeal. Often in these days of photoplays, we have Indian characters, done less appreciatively, and generally with the red man depicted with too much savagery. Of Indian poetry and music much might be written, but only a few lines to stimulate further study can be offered here. To these red children, as to the Hawaiians and negroes, it seems just natural to sing. Thurlow Lieurance, creator of the popular song "By the Waters of Minnetonka," and an outstanding student of Indian music, says, "I am convinced that the Indian has a theme for every activity and characteristic of his life. His best songs are his spiritual songs." Some of these spontaneous songs 492 have been caught and recorded, it would seem, with fidelity to their spirit. Outstanding artist-students in this field are Natalie Curtis Burlin, who gave us a great contribution in The Indian's Book, and Mary Austin, author of The Path of the Rainbow and The American Rhythm. A few lines from poems found in these volumes will serve here to illustrate the delicate beauty and spirit of Indian lyrics at their best: These are from songs translated by Natalie Curtis Burlin: HOLY SONG All was revealed to me From the beginning Know I all, hear me! All was revealed to mel (Now saith the spirit, Tell of me; Dream thou!) SONG AFTER RAIN Now behold! Through bright clusters of flowers Yellow butterflies Are chasing at play, All through the blossoming beans Blue butterflies Are chasing at play. Ann Nolan Clark is another author who has given us some Indian lyrics of delicate quality (see History Sings by Hazel Gertrude Kinscella for the following and others): NIGHT Night is outside In his black blanket. I hear him Talking to the wind. I do not know him. He is outside. I am here In my mother's hogan, Warm in my sheepskin Close to my mother. The things I know are around me Like a blanket, Keeping me safe From these things RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE JULY 1946 Which are strange, Keeping me safe. All the trust of childhood, and the tenderness of mother love are in these lines. Natalie Curtis Burlin has suggested something of the difficulty and the conscientious work involved in delving into the "unexplored riches of the religious, poetic and musical thought of a stranger race" ?and setting before "the white race something of the art life (which is the soul life) of a simpler, yet more profound people." The Canadian Indian poet, Pauline Johnson, has written many excellent poems about her people. Some of the best known are published in the volume Flint and Feather. We all have much to learn from these first Americans. This study can only be an "Open Sesame" to the treasures in the theme. Latterday Saints, of all people, should be leaders in the search for these riches. Discussion and Activities 1. Hight lights from Hiawatha ? Be prepared to take part in reading aloud five to ten brief excerpts from this poem, assigned by the teacher, to give something of its spirit and its story. For example: "Wabun, the East Wind," Canto II. "Nokomis and Baby Hiawatha," Canto III. (Begin "At the door on summer evenings" to "Blossom in_ that _heaven above us.") Make other brief selections. Plan for ten to fifteen minutes presentation. 2. Indians in Fiction Be prepared to give an introduction of not more than two minutes to any one of the following characters: Uncas, Ramona, or another Indian character you feel is well portrayed in literature, fiction or drama. To make sure the introduction is held within two minutes, it will be well to write a paragraph or two on the character. 3.

Edgar Lyon Preview of Lessons for 1946-47
THIS course of lessons has been prepared for those Relief Societies in the stakes and missions that find the literature course unsuitable to their needs. Some Relief Societies are located in foreign-language missions, where the lessons dealing with American literature are not practicable. Many mission Relief Societies feel greater need for more gospel study, as the members are, for the most part, recent converts who desire doctrinal and religious instruction in preference to literary study. It is for situations of this type that these optional lessons have been prepared, and the choice of which course to study is left to the decision of the stake and mission Relief Society presidents.
The eight lessons in the course were planned as a survey of the gospel plan, emphasizing the place that our religious teachings should have in our daily lives. From the very inception of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, its leaders have attempted to lead the members to understand that the gospel is not a way of believing, or a mere mental assent to a group of doctrinal ideas. They have stressed the fact that true religion and life are inseparable. Even such an abstract doctrine as pre-existence has been interpreted in terms of its relationship to earth life, and the incentive it
might offer for the improvement of conduct during mortality.
During the year these lessons will trace the course of man's immortal life, beginning with his pre-earth existence and continuing on into the world in which we now live. A discussion of the first principles and ordinances of the gospel will be presented, not so much from the point of view of the scriptural proof for these practices, but rather from their meaning and significance in the lives of Church members today. Repentance is an eternal principle that must always find place in our lives. Baptism and the reception of the Holy Ghost, while usually experienced only once in a lifetime, become symbols of a new birth that should lead to a view of the newness of life that is ever changing and should be constantly improving. The interpretation of Church work as carried on by the members is interpreted as a means of seeking the abundant life Jesus pointed out as a goal.
The great amount of effort and means spent by the Church in the maintenance of its educational and recreational programs is discussed from the standpoint of their place in the philosophy of Mormonism, and in their application to our needs in the present social order. LESSON DEPARTMENT Lesson 1. Man's Earth Life Objective: To show that mankind passed through a pre-existent state, during which preparations were made for an earth life, in terms of a plan of salvation that might lead to exaltation. Lesson 2. The General Gospel Plan Objective: 'To inspire the members to realize the priceless value of their free agency as a necessary part of the gospel plan, and its part in eternal progression. Lesson 3. Faith Objective: 'To demonstrate that faith is a principle of action, giving power to the believer whereby great things may be achieved in life. Lesson 4. Repentance Objective: To illustrate the fact that repentance is a process through which we grow from wrong-doing to improved conduct, and draw closer to God. Lesson 5. Baptism Objective: To explain the symbolism and meaning of baptism in terms of its relationship to being "born again," into an improved way of living within the gospel fold. Lesson 6. Laying on of Hands for the Gift of the Holy Ghost Objective: To explain the nature of the Holy Ghost and its function in the lives of those who have had it bestowed upon them by proper authority. Lesson 7. The Abundant Life Objective: 'To show that service to one's fellow men and the observance of Church standards lead one to the enjoyment of abundant living here and hereafter. 495 Lesson 8. Education and Recreation Objective: To review the interest that the Church has always manifested in education and recreation, and to appreciate the part which these phases of Church endeavor now contribute to the lives of its members. References All the standard works of the Church have been used in the preparation of these lessons, and are referred to in the lessons themselves.

Lesson I Man's Pre-Earth Life For Tuesday, October 15, 1946 or several days Dr. And Mrs. Jones had looked forward to a night together at the theater. A much advertised three-act mystery play was the attraction. On the evening of the play, shortly before 496 time to depart for the show house, a telephone call notified the doctor of an accident, in which one of his patients was involved. Arranging for a taxi to take his wife to the theater, he promised to join her as soon as he had rendered the necessary assistance to the injured person. The curtain was rising on the second act when at last Dr. Jones took his place at the side of his wife. With his mind unprepared by the first act, he watched the second act develop the complicated mystery which had been introduced before his arrival. As the curtain fell, he had no clear conception of the play and hoped during the intermission to be enlightened by his wife concerning the nature of the plot as it had been portrayed during the first act. At that moment an usher tapped him on the shoulder and whispered, "Dr. Jones, there is a telephone call for you." A new emergency had arisen, and Dr. Jones was forced to leave the theater without having heard an explanation of the first act or having witnessed the clarification that the last would have given. His mind was in a state of bewilderment. The conduct of the actors, their conversation, and the implications and suspicions aroused during the second act of the play seemed to be a confusion of ideas. No wonder his opinion of the play was expressed by his words: "It's a meaningless jumble to me?it doesn't make sense!"' In similar fashion, most of mankind is bewildered by the spectacle of mortal existence, its confusion and the conflicts that are seen on every hand. 'The observable differences in mental capacity, color of RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE JULY 1946 skin, and geographic location of various peoples seem manifestly unfair in view of a belief in a just God. The manner in which apparent sinners are blessed, while the more righteous suffer untold hardships, anguish, and distress, cause misgivings in the minds of many people concerning the power of God in our lives.  The great number of people who choose evil instead of good or become confused in trying to decide what is most worthwhile in life, makes the scene of human existence one that may appear to be without ultimate purpose or goal. The reason for this apparent confusion is to be found in the fact that (according to our present knowledge) earth life is but the second act or period of a three-act drama of eternal living pre-existence and the hereafter being the first and the third. When an attempt is made to judge the entire plan on the basis of what we observe during its second phase only, it may seem as meaningless to us as the mystery drama did to Dr. Jones. We need to know something of the first period of existence to understand the purpose of the second state, and the third division of existence must be understood in order to comprehend the entire plan of salvation. One of the most basic truths taught by the restored gospel is the fact that man had a conscious existence before he was born on earth. In a revelation given to Joseph Smith, the Lord revealed some enlightening facts concerning the eternal nature of man. He declared:... I was in the beginning with the Father, and am the first-born... Ye were also in the beginning with the Father; LESSON DEPARTMENT that which is Spirit, even the Spirit of truth... Man was also in the beginning with God. Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be. All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, to act for itself, as all intelligence also, otherwise there is no existence. Behold, here is the agency of man, and here is the condemnation of man, because that which was from the beginning is plainly manifest unto them, and they receive not the light... For man is spirit. The elements are eternal, and spirit and element, inseparably connected, receiveth a fulness of joy (Doc. And Cov. 93:21, 23, 29, 3% 31, 33, 34)- Having fathered the spirits of mankind (see Numbers 16:22 and 27:16), God most certainly gave them opportunity for development in those things which were necessary for their advancement. The Eternal Father revealed to Moses that all of his physical creations are purposeful (see Moses 1:33). Knowing this, we can be sure that he would provide the spirits of mankind with some type of purposeful activity and instruction. Just what the nature of this training period was has never been revealed. It was certainly, however, calculated to prepare the spirits for the proper choice in the decision that each must ultimately make. When this training was completed a great council was called in heaven. Here the Father's will was revealed, and a plan proposed for the next stage in the development toward a fulness of joy The plan recognized the need for the creation of bodies of tangible matter in which the spirits that God had created could be embodied. But from this point onward Lucifer and Jesus differed markedly. Satan urged a universal salvation by compulsion for every spirit-child of God, and 497 in addition, he desired to take to himself the honor and glory which belonged to the Father (see Isaiah 14:12-14). Jesus agreed to carry out the Father's will and urged that the opportunity for salvation be given to all, contingent upon the exercise of the free agency of the individual and all the glory be to the Father forever. This was apparently in keeping both with the will of the Father and the previous training of his spirit children. Upon acceptance of the Father's will by Jesus, Satan attempted to impose his plan by force, and then each spirit was given the opportunity to exercise its intelligence and agency. Satan led away one-third of the spirits with him, but the others became heirs of salvation, depending upon their faithfulness and obedience (see Abraham 3:24-28). Individual differences must have existed in this pre-existent state just as they were to appear later in earth life. These differences were apparently the consequences of the effort and diligence exercised by the individual spirits. In a vision, Abraham was permitted to see something of this difference in development that had taken place during the period of pre-mortal existence: And the Lord said unto me: These two facts do exist, that there are two spirits, one being more intelligent than the other; there shall be another more intelligent than they; I am the Lord thy God, I am more intelligent than they all... 1 dwell in the midst of them all... I rule in the heavens above, and in the earth beneath _ over all the intelligences thine eyes have seen from the beginning; I came down in the beginning in the midst of all the intelligences thou hast seen. Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before 498 the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones; and God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits.. And he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born (Abraham 3:19,21-23). This scripture introduces us to the doctrine of foreordination. Abraham learned that he had been chosen to a position of spiritual leadership long before his earthly birth. A careful study of Abraham 3:19 and 21 indicates that his selection for leadership on earth must have come about because of his greater intelligence and superiority of character that had been gained during his pre-existent life. It was not a result of favoritism on the part of God, nor a capricious whim of the Eternal Father. Rather, it was a reward for meritorious service. God, who is all-wise, could certainly foresee the greatness of Abraham's character and trustworthiness. However, there was no compulsion attached to the selection. Abraham had the right to fulfill the position of leadership assigned to him in the pre-existence, but he could also have rejected the calling. In_ this manner we see that people may be foreordained for certain assignments, but they are not forced to comply. Biblical evidence of this doctrine of foreordination is found in the words of the Lord to the Prophet Jeremiah: Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and J ordained thee a prophet unto the nations (Jeremiah 1:5). RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?JULY 1946 Brigham Young explained the principle of foreordination in these words: It is a mistaken idea that God has decreed all things whatsoever that come to pass, for the volition of the creature is as free as air. You may inquire whether we believe in foreordination; we do, as strongly as any people in the world. We believe that Jesus was foreordained before the foundations of the world were built, and his mission was appointed him in eternity to be the Savior of the world, yet when he came in the flesh he was left free to choose or refuse to obey his Father... We also are free to choose or refuse the principles of eternal life. God has decreed and foreordained many things that have come to pass, and he will continue to do so; but when he decrees great blessings upon a nation or upon an individual they are decreed upon certain conditions (Discourses of Brigham Young, page 85; 1941 edition, page 55). Having progressed to the point in the pre-existent state that the organized spirits had undergone the necessary apprenticeship, they were ready for the second act of the eternal drama. It was necessary for these intelligent spirits to be embodied in mortality, where new experiences could be gained. Accordingly, preparations were made for this next period of development, namely, that of mortality on this earth. Discussion and Activity Problems. What can we learn concerning Jesus Christ from Ether 3:6-16 and John 1:1-14; 6:62; 16:28; and 17:1-5?. To what extent can an understanding of the pre-existence influence our daily conduct during mortality?. Practically all Christian sects believe  LESSON DEPART MENT that life begins at birth. What reasons can you resent to show that this view is both unsatisfying and inconsistent? Social Science The Family Social Science Committee, 499 References Smith, Pres.

Since these lessons deal primarily with basic Latter-day disciples, it expected that the women called to teach them will have firm conviction of their worth and importance, 4) that all references and subject matter taught will be in harmony with the teachings of the Church. We urge that reference material from volumes of Church literature by past and present General Authorities, be freely used. That through conformity to the celestial for eternity. We may gain everlasting jov and exaltation. 500 Lesson 2. The Family Organization Objective: To consider the qualifications necessary for happiness and development within the home, as well as the rights and responsibilities of various members of the family. Lesson 3. The Importance of Child Training Objective: To give specific guidance in child training and to stress the need of developing sound practices in the important calling of parenthood. Lesson 4. Observing a Principle of Prosperity Objective: To discuss wise spending, saving, home ownership, payment of tithes and fast offerings as contributing factors to the security and prosperity of the family. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE JULY 1946 Lesson 5. Importance of Religious Instruction in the Home Objective: To show why children should be given religious education in the home and what that instruction should include. Lesson 6. Constructive Use of Time Objective: To stress the necessity for prudent use of time so that the essential needs of life are balanced in correct proportion. Lesson 7. Gratitude in the Home Objective: To show that we should cultivate gratitude in our homes for the many blessings we enjoy and for each other's companionship, and that we should express appreciation to our Heavenly Father through prayer, and righteous living. Lesson The Family Unit Eternal For Tuesday, October 22, 1946.. Whatsoever you seal on earth shall be sealed in heaven; and whatsoever you bind on earth, in my name and by my word, saith the Lord, it shall be eternally bound in the heavens THE purpose of the family unit is twofold: first, to bring spirits into the world, that they may receive mortal bodies; and second, to provide an environment suitable to the proper growth and development of those spirits, that they may be worthy to return to the presence of God. The home is the foundation and bulwark of society. Its sanctity must be ever guarded if we are to achieve the glorious destiny God has planned for us. Family life as viewed by Latter-day Saints is a long-range program which reaches into eternity and is perfect in its concept. If we live the principles of the gospel, we shall be able to carry out the purposes of. (Doc. And Cov. 132: 46). God and receive great joy and glory therefrom. God's Eternal Design Our lives will be more purposeful if we understand that God designed an eternal existence for us. Though our memory of the pre-existence has been taken from us, the gospel teaches that we lived in a pre-mortal state. What did that pre-existence do for us? There we were born spiritually, in that home we associated with the Father of our spirits. That life was a necessary preparation for the one we live here. Our life there was free from coercion. We were permitted to live in full fellowship with our Father or to be faithless and rebellious. If we chose the course of obedience, we developed with those who were faithful. We learned that progress comes through the acceptance of the gospel plan. We developed to the point where it was necessary to receive mortal bodies in order to progress further.
Then we were ready for the second estate. The Lord disclosed his purpose for us before we came to mortality, for we read in the Pearl of Great Price:
And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell; And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them; And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; and they who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate; and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever (Abraham 3:24-26).
Being privileged to receive a body and enter into the second estate or mortal life is a great blessing.
We came to this earth that we might have a body and present it pure before God in the Celestial kingdom. The great principle of happiness consists in having a body. The devil has no body, and herein is his punishment. He is pleased when he can obtain the tabernacle of man, and when cast out by the Savior he asked to go into the herd of swine, showing that he would prefer a swine's body to having none (Joseph Smith, Richards and Little's Compendium�"Gems," page 288).
Receiving a body is not only an opportunity for experience and development, but with mortality comes responsibility. Man is given his free agency here upon earth. He is free to choose the path he will follow but must account for the actions of this life. Through proper living of the gospel we are entitled to know right from wrong, truth from error.
The gospel plan, if followed, will bring joy and happiness in this estate as well as in the life to come. The Prophet Joseph Smith said, "Happiness is the object and design of our existence and will be the end thereof if we pursue the path that leads to it."
Divine Institution of Marriage
The opening drama of human existence upon this earth was introduced by God, who created man. He approved the companionship of Adam and Eve for he said, "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an helpmeet for him . . . And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man" (Gen. 2:18,22).
President Joseph F. Smith said:
This institution of marriage is not a man-made institution . . . God not only commends but he commands marriage. . . He united our first parents in the bonds of holy matrimony, and commanded them to be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth . . . Marriage is the preserver of the human race. Without it, the purposes of God would be frustrated (Gospel Doctrine pp. 341, 342).
If those who enter into marriage would realize that it is God's eternal plan by which spirits come into the world, there would arise a new dedication and high resolve to faithfully fulfill the purpose of creation.
President Smith also said:
Neither are the relationships that exist, or should exist, between parents and children, and between children and parents, of an ephemeral nature, nor of a temporal character. They are of eternal consequence, reaching beyond the veil, in spite of all that we can do. The man, and the woman who are the agents, in the providence of God, to bring living souls into the world, are made before God and the heavens, as responsible for these acts as is God himself responsible for the works of his own hands, and for the revelation of his own wisdom. The man and the woman who engage in the ordinance of matrimony are engaging in something that is of such far-reaching character, and is of such vast importance, that thereby hangs life and death, and eternal increase. Thereupon depends eternal happiness, or eternal misery (Gospel Doctrine, page 342).
Marriage for Eternity
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believes in marriage for eternity. This is one of the great truths revealed in the latter days. When we enter worthily into one of the temples and have a servant of the living God marry us for time and eternity, there comes to us one of the greatest blessings bestowed upon mortals. Two lives have been united in companionship for eternity.
President Heber J. Grant said:
The blessings and promises that come from beginning life together, for time and eternity, in a temple of the Lord cannot be obtained in any other way. Worthy young Latter-day Saint men and women who so begin life together find that their eternal partnership under the everlasting covenant becomes the foundation upon which are built peace, happiness, virtue, love, and all of the other eternal verities of life, here and hereafter.
I believe that many of the troubles of
those Latter-day Saints who have sorrow in their homes and difficulties with their families come from neglect in carrying out the commandments of God, one of the most important of which concerns temple marriage. Much sorrow is chargeable to indifference to this and other requirements (Gospel Standards, page 153).
President Brigham Young said:
There is not a young man in our community who would not be willing to travel from here to England to be married right, if he understood things as they are; there is not a young woman in our community who loves the Gospel and wishes its blessings, that would be married in any other way (Discourses of Brigham Young, pp. 302-303).
Even the grave is not the end of our marriage, but only a gateway leading into an enlarged sphere of endless progression. As a loving companion gazes upon the lifeless remains of his beloved, he realizes that the spirit is not there but has gone to join those who have victoriously overcome the world. While in this life we have friends and relatives, there is an indescribable joy in having a devoted wife or husband with whom to share one's happiness. If that is true in this life, it will be increased in the world to come.
If marriage is solemnized in the temple, by those who hold the proper authority, a glorious opportunity is presented:
Then shall they be gods, because they have no end; therefore shall they be from everlasting to everlasting, because they continue; then shall they be above all, because all things are subject unto them. Then shall they be gods, because they have all power, and the angels are subject unto them (Doc. and Cov. 132:20).
Every Latter-day Saint should be inspired by this exalted destiny  LESSON DEPARTMENT offered to him. Our hearts should throb with a new determination to claim this blessing, and we should seek to impress on all our associates who do not understand it, the vital importance of obtaining this blessing. Eternal Glory Obtained by Obedience to Law The grandeur of this philosophy of eternal marriage should inspire us in our family circles to more righteous living. With this philosophy we should labor more diligently each day to secure our family unit eternally. There will be problems to solve each day, but with such an inspiring principle we should be able to surmount each crisis. 'The spirit of the Lord abiding in our homes will minimize the troubles and sorrows of life, and enhance the joys of companionship. When a couple is married in the temple, their blessing is predicated upon obedience to law. 'Transgression results in a denial of eternal blessings. Eternity is not gained in a single bound. Each day we build for eternity through righteous conduct in, our daily lives. Temple marriage is a glorious experience for any couple. 'The peaceful and beautiful surroundings are most impressive and uplifting. Having a servant of God perform the ceremony one holding the priesthood with the power to seal on earth and it shall be sealed in the heavens, makes the union sacred and binding. Young people should be trained from childhood to live up to the requirements for entrance into the House of the Lord, then last-minute 503 reforms will not be necessary. They should be taught the benefits of temple marriage so that they will prepare themselves and look forward to this great privilege. Our children who are born in the Priesthood are legal heirs, and entitled to the revelations of the Lord... (Discourses of Brigham Young, page 303). Our family units will be secured by our obedience to the law of the gospel, and this obedience will entitle us to "pass by the angels, and the gods, which are set there..." (Doc. And Cov. 132:19) to our exaltation. Guidance for Discussion 1, What truths are revealed in scripture regarding our pre-existence?

TO A GREAT LEADER Bertha M. Rosevear Like sentinels that guard a sacred shrine, Great towering mountains stand in martial line, And safe within their shadow, as foretold, A holy temple lifts its spires old, A testimony proud to pioneers Who colonized the western rough frontiers. Omnipotence revealed that favored land, And by his Prophet led a chosen band Of faithful saints, across a sun-parched plain; Their burning lips knew not the touch of rain, Unfaltering they trudged that weary space Until their leader said: "This is the place." Undaunted still, though far as eye could see The desert spread her arms, no friendly tree Or cooling stream bespoke of verdant field, Or hinted of a bounteous harvest yield, Humbly they breathed a fervent prayer to God, Then straightway rose to plow the virgin sod.
