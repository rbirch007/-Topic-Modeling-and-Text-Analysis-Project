RETURN OF SPRING Olive M. Nicholes Orion waves his jewelled sword on high And marches onward with the frosty stars; Fair Venus rises in the evening mists And hangs her lantern in the April sky. The crocus stirs beneath the frozen clod, The river slips its crystal barricade; The warm earth stirs and lives and breathes again And pours its bounty in the hands of God. The pale narcissus blooms in dappled shade, Blue violets embroider woodland trails; Among the pussy willows by the brook The veery flutes his vernal serenade. Why should I tremble when the planets swing Their sure, celestial pathway through the stars, When blighted gardens and the frozen hills Pass on to blaze a trail for fragrant spring? Though mankind barters for his brother's soul  This do I know, if all the world forgets, That the eternal mind of man shall move With certitude, unhurried to its goal. The Cover: "Desert Roses" from a photograph by Dr. Walter P. Cottam VOL. 33, NO. 4 APRIL 1946 "ON THE WAY To EMMAUs" Tom a Painting by Plockhorst "Concerning Jesus of Nazareth" 6  A ND, behold, two of them went that same day to the village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs. And they talked together of all these things which had happened. And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad? And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days? And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him. But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done. Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre; And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive. And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it seven so as the women had said: but him they saw not. Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken: Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further. But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them. Page 219 And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures? And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread. And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. (Luke 24:13-36) SPRINGTIME KNOLL Ivy Houtz Woolley God's carpet is a springtime knoll. The Master Weaver's best, A garden pattern on display, Superb from foot to crest. Aglow with green bedecked with buds, And sunshine gleaming through, A mindful skill this carpet shows Beneath the sky's cool blue. My carpet is a springtime knoll, Bloom-spattered meads my shrine  I worship in this lovely place, This house of God's and mine. 220 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE APRIL 1946 Before the Dawn Alice Morrey Bailey There is an hour of darkness in the night Beyond reflected rays of yesterday, Too early yet to catch the coming light Refracted from tomorrow' s newest ray. THE quotation, 'The darkest hour is just before the dawn/' is more than a matter of night and day, more than a certain num-ber of hours each of hght and dark- ness in the minds of men. This bit , of philosophy was perhaps created to hft the heart, heavy with burdens, and to shed the hght of hope into the darkness of despair. The "darkest hour" in the hves of men is made up of various ingredi-ents, not the least of which is dis-couragement and self-doubt at the soundless falling of carefully built structures of hope, when one stands in the ruins of a cherished theory, or counts the cost of time and effort that are now rubble at his feet. Pasteur, Koch� all the truth-seek-ers in the field of science are famil-iar with this form of darkness. Banting, an obscure Canadian doc-tor was one of these. February ii, 1922, Fred Banting was in his laboratory at the Univer-sity of Toronto. With him were two men. One was Charlie Best, his faithful helper through months and weeks of grilling research, nights of sleeplessness, and days of anxiety, while they had pursued an elusive, life-saving truth that had come to Dr. Banting in a flash of in-spiration during the night of Octo-ber 30, t wo years before. The other man was Joe Gilchrist, Dr. Bant-ing's dear friend, who was dying the slow, starving death of diabetes. This night was the culminating point, the night when their long fight was to be given the test� whether this new medicine would work on humans as well as it did on dogs. No one but a desperately sick man would have submitted to that test, for its failure might mean death. They fed him an ounce of pure glucose and tested his breath to see if his body would burn it. Of course it wouldn't! They shot the new medicine in with a hypodermic, and waited� one hour, two hours. Noth-ing happened. Banting was sick at heart. His medicine had failed. It was the old story! What would work on dogs might not work on hu-mans. Not daring to look at Joe, he left to catch a train. * � � * A differ e nttyp e of "dar k esth o ur"oftenco mestoonewh o has fought too hard for some prize, has paid too high a cost, and, having at-tained it,f inds that it is dust and ashes in his hands. In this category are all who forfeit morality, virtue, or honesty for people, possessions, or causes� things that may seem in and of themselves to be fine and desir-able. And yet "The leopard never changes his spots," is a human doc-trine, foreign to the teachings of One who died between two thieves. Those who have gone beyond the Page 221  222 moral boundaries are most in need of the helping hand. They have lost the power to discern tight from wrong; they are most dependent upon the clear and unselfish thinking of others, after floundering in a sea of confused values. Creative people are particularly prey to moods of exhilaration or despondency, so  much so that fits of "temperament" are expected of them. Perhaps itis because emotion is an integral part of creativeness, and emotion is by turns a flatterer and a depressant, but never a reliable pair of spectacles through which an artist may view his own creation. Robert Louis Stevenson, at Sherryvore, Bournemouth, England, once wrote feverishly for three days on a new story that had come to him in a dream ten thousand words a day, while the household went about masterpiece, finished, called his wife and her son, Lloyd Osbourne, sn and read them the manuscript with an intensity that made shivers Tun UP and down Lloyd's spine. When Stevenson came to the end, gazing Up at them in triumph and self-satisfaction, waited for the outbreak of enthusiasm from his wife, whose fine powers of criticism and analysis he relied upon. "Robert, you have missed the whole point," she said. "You've missed the whole allegory." angry, Lloyd trembling from the room, and his mother in tears to her apartment. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE APRIL 1946 RIGHTEOUS indignation at un just treatment is justifiable, but it is effective only when something can be done to relieve the situation, to undo the wrong: Henry Collins Brown sat in the hopelessness of an insane asylum contemplating suicide. He felt that death was a door behind which were the mental door; that he had the power to tum it, with every reason to do so, and no good reason not to. He had lost his lifework. He had formerly been curator and founder of the Museum of the City of New York, into which position he had put the best years of his life. He had fought for the preservation of valuable historical relics, for a home in which to collect and care for them. He had delivered many learned lectures and solicited funds for the cause. For many ye" he had struggled against the indifference of people until he had accomplished his He knew that, whether he lived or died, the museum was established and the work would go On, It was then that the Museum officials decided he was too old for the job he was sixty-five and removed nim, supplanting him with a "popinjay" from the West, who had never seen New York, and who affronted the cultivated patrons of the institution. Dr. Brown went down un der the weight of these injustices an from overwork. He believed there was nothing left to live for; it was too late to start over again, and this seemed to be the end. BEFORE THE DAWN These are isolated pictures of seemingly different human crises, but they have some things in common, as all human beings have certain things in common. As mortal beings, all people are subject to disappointments and even defeats which are inevitably to be met in one form or another during our sojourn upon the earth. The bottom drops out of the bucket of hope. Nature betrays the young; death assails security. Each man may look at his neighbor with envy, thinking he sees a man with no burdens, no problems. The soldier returning with the loss of an eye or an arm does not see spiritual death, mental and moral cripples, in the physically whole. The beautiful dreams of aspiring souls peace, brotherhood, wise parenthood, unselfish love and religious perfection are more often ideals to strive toward rather than realities which are ours. Nevertheless, they must be striven for, because they can be achieved, and simply, too, by obedience to divine and eternal laws of truth. "He that loseth his life shall find it," said Jesus. Death was not the end for him, but a new and glorious beginning. The morning of the resurrection was sweet and fair. The brightest hour in human history was when Mary, stooping to peer into the tomb, saw the empty linens of death, the angels robed in white at the foot and head of the tomb, and when Jesus revealed himself to her, asking: "Woman, why weepest thou?" (John 20:11-16). The Son of Man was not only personally victorious over the great enemy of life on earth, he laid a pattern through death to life again that every man can and will follow. 223 Moreover, the words of his wisdom, that fell some two thousand years ago on the ears of herdsmen and farmers, high priests and moneychangers, are still the patterns of wise living, and in no less measure applicable to men of today.... "And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free," he told them (John 8:32). CHARLES Banting had been doing just that seeking the truth to make men free. His story might well have ended on that night of September 11, 1922. The short time and sparse materials allotted to him for his research had been used long since. Any day now he would be dismissed by the more important heads of the institution, who had no patience with his harebrained idea anyhow. His thoughts were dark with discouragement as he boarded the train to go to his home. He didn't know that he had left too soon, that, back in Toronto, Charlie Best was saying: "Let's have another go at it, Joe," and that Joe was breathing much better, that suddenly, after months, his head was clear again and his legs had lost their heaviness that he was able to eat a good supper, after which he took a stroll, grinning and "walking on air," as he put it. By the time of Banting's arrival at his home the news had been telephoned, and Banting was given the message that freed millions from death by diabetes for Banting had discovered insulin. So narrow is the margin between success and failure! So small is the 224 moment when the heart touches bottom and wavers between disaster and the will to go on! Robert Louis Stevenson brooded for three days over his disappointment in his wife's verdict. Finally, he called her in, told her he had accepted her judgment, and, over her tearful protests, threw his feverishly written manuscript into the fire. If he tried to mend it, the result would be a patchwork of good and bad, he declared, so he was going to write it over! He wrote steadily for three more days, 10,000 words each day, and the tenth day after he had begun it, he sent off to the publishers the manuscript, replete with significance and rich with allegory, that lives to this day as one of the greatest stories ever to come from the pen of an author Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. can forgive, but I can't forget," is another fallacy humans cling to, though it is entirely foreign to the gospel of "seventy times seven." Dr. Brown, now gone down the long hall, beyond reach of human influence or the written word, reached toward the knob of suicide on the door of death, and, as he teached, he learned some eternal truths, notably that lack of controlled thinking had put him where he was, and that self-control was the only road back. He took that long way back, slipping many times, losing ground that had to be regained. With part of his mind "mislaid," the rest of it RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE APRIL 1946 went on functioning. He observed his fellow inmates and analyzed their difficulties. After three years at the Bloomingdale Hospital, Dr. Brown was a member of the free world once more. He carried with him a message of hope and encouragement from the most hopeless of all worlds, the world of the insane. He delivered lectures and gave verbal encouragement to hundreds who were in danger of losing their minds. At the age of seventy-five, his book A Mind Mislaid was published, a book particularly helpful to those subject to nervous breakdown, for in it are constructive truths that he learned at the doors of self-destruction: No matter how hard it is, one must forget, and once having forgotten, it is not hard to forgive. There is absolutely no virtue in repining; there is positive harm and real danger in thinking back to what might have been. The gentle gospel of the Master of "Beginning Again" contains all the essentials of joyful, successful living, and his words about faith, repentance, and forgiveness peace, and brotherly love are not platitudes, as we sometimes regard them, but hard and fast rules by which men must live, or come to the grief of war, failure, self-destruction, and even the destruction of others. Despair and discouragement are the tools of evil, and they are too much at hand in the darkest hour. April, with its returning life, holding, as it does, the resurrection of the Savior, is truly an especial time for new beginnings. It is the bright morning after the dark night of winter.. Echoes of Hope Marguerite Griffin THERE is peace in the scriptures, and purity of thought, poetry of form. There is poise for the perplexed, paeans of praise for the joyful, prophecy for the student, prayer for the tormented. There is strength in the scriptures, and sustenance for the soul, satisfaction for the heart. There is hope for a happier day, to which the anxious soul may cling as a weary bird to a haven of safety and refuge. Then read, O ye people who are weary and heavy-laden! Read the pages in which there is life, in which there is hope and strength, in which there is peace, the "peace which passeth all understanding," the peace that must first be born in the human heart before it can permanently live in the world of men. The kind of peace that alone can heal the bitter wounds of war, that alone can eliminate racial hatred and prejudice, that alone can make all people feel their brotherhood, their kinship. It is the peace that God, the Father of mankind, waits quietly to implant in the seeking heart. Though today the world suffers with the aftermath of war, I can find peace when I read the sacred word. I can keep that peace as a wall of strength about my vulnerable soul, only as I remember, only as I live by those words. I am weak. The winds of confusion, of fear, of pestilence, of death; blow hot upon my citadel. They 'scorch my defenses. They roar with terror in my ears. I must return Page 226 again and again, and yet again, to the well which is never dry. I must drink cooling draughts from it, else I cannot bear the heat of this perplexing day. Over and over I must remind myself, as King David did long years ago, that "the Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want." There is solace in this song because it rings with an answering echo from the spoken words of the Man of Galilee whose sojourn among men, though brief, can never be forgotten. His lips spoke gentle comfort to all men everywhere. His words were meek and kind and understanding. His life was lived to fulfill his Father's will and was offered on the cross because of his great love for you and me. Think upon him for a moment, how he lived only to give the world one great message, the simple story of love, love of God and love of all men. The world listened. The world remembered. But the world has never wholly heeded the precept. Yet the memory of this Man has endured and will always endure as long as there are souls who love truth and freedom as long as there are yet those who will read his words. Sit in the quiet of your room. Shut yourself in with the quiet precepts of this Jesus of Nazareth. Or, if your world has been blacked out, if all is dark around you, if your eyes have for the moment lost their vision, or if your Book is not at hand, let your heart repeat the ECHOES OF HOPE Christian's universal creed: "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want." You know the words. Let them peal with the solemnity of sweet-toned bells, and before the sound of each line shall have died away, like an echo, you can hear the words of the Son of God, speaking again, as he did so long ago, words of assurance, words of hope, words of peace. Listen! You can hear them even now. THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD; I SHALL NOT WANT. I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. But. He that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep. I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine. As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.... My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand (John 10: 11-15; 27-29). HE MAKETH ME TO LIE DOWN IN GREEN PASTURES: I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture (John 10:9). HE LEADETH ME BESIDE THE STILL WATERS. Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life (John 4:13-14). HE RESTORETH MY SOUL: I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live (John 11:25). HE LEADETH ME IN PATHS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS FOR HIS NAME'S SAKE. If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.... For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works (Matthew 16:24-27). YEA, THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH, I WILL FEAR NO EVIL: FOR THOU ART WITH ME; THY ROD AND THY STAFF THEY COM.- FORT ME. Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom (Luke 12:32). Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? And one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows (Matthew 10: 29-31). And, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world (Matthew 28:20). THOU PREPAREST A TABLE BEFORE ME IN THE PRESENCE OF MINE ENEMIES: THOU ANOINTEST MY HEAD WITH OIL; MY CUP RUNNETH OVER. If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you (John 15:18-19). SURELY GOODNESS AND MERCY SHALL FOLLOW ME ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE: AND I WILL DWELL IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD FOREVER. 228 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also (John 14:2-3). And then, like a benediction, I think I hear him praying, as he did when his life was so near its end, praying for you and for me. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.... I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from evil.. O nghteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me. And RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE APRIL 1946 I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them (John 17: 11, 15, 25, 26). O hear, all ye people! Hear and remember the words of the Man who has redeemed you with his blood. Hear and understand the message in this greatest Book of books. Hear, not alone with the ears, but with the mind, the heart, the soul. Hear and be comforted! Hear and be strong! Hear the words that speak of life eternal, the words that tell of hope, glorious and tnumphant, of love, deep and everlasting. Hear and know! When there is hope for the future, there is strength for today! WHEN HE RETURNS, REMEMBERING Dott J. Sartori After he has known suffering  This lad in khaki, in navy, in white  The thunder of hate, the rapier of greed, The heat and cold intemperate, After the white sheet of mercy is laid Cool and quiet across his wound, He will remember the Testament Where love was kindled and hate disowned. He will loose Christ from the printed Book, He will bring Easter against the tomb, When he returns, remembering, Back to this city and to this room. An Aria for Easter Vesta P. Crawford "I know that my redeemer liveth...." (Job. 19:25) HE greatest words in all the world, the most magnificent music this has been said for almost two hundred years by the millions who have heard the faultless aria from Handel's Messiah. Particularly, in a time of change and uncertainty, it is not surprising that so many Christian people are finding new beauty and new strength in this Easter message. The words carry the simple, eternal beauty of scripture, "I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth...." In these phrases there is no faltering, no question. Here is truth for the ages, for all who have doubted, for all who have believed. The music is a treasure that glows with brighter radiance through the years. Who was the matchless musician, the man Handel, who wrote this lofty and sacred music, who touched the utmost heights of composition? In the year 1685, a boy was born in Halle, Germany. His father said at once, "This child must be a lawyer. The shape of his head shows that he will have a great mind." His was a great mind, but not destined for the practice of law. Per. Haps, if he had become a lawyer, his name might long ago have been forgotten. Now, so long as music is repeated in the world, the name of George Frederick Handel will be imperishable. The young musician learned to play the harpsichord when he was only four years old and he was Teally no more than a child when he mastered the keys of the magnificent church organ in the Halle cathedral. This was the beginning of Handel's devotion to organ music. "The tones of the organ," he said, "bring harmonies from the immortals, and surely the angels are near when the great organ sings its theme of praise." The violin was the next instru. Ment mastered by Handel. He turned, then, to composition and wrote several operas in the style used by the Italians of his day. After his first opera was produced in London, in 1711, Handel was so toyally welcomed that he felt himself being adopted by the music-loving people of "green and rainy" England. It was not long before the German-born Handel became court musician to the King of England. George the First had a beautiful boat equipped with throne chairs. The boat sailed up and down the river Thames carrying the King of England and Handel, the King of Music. "Water Music" was the name given to the compositions that Handel played for the King as their boat plied the famous river. ANDEL, however, was seeking a medium greater than solitary compositions, greater, even, than operas. There was in his nature a deep spiritual yearning that finalPage 229 230 A Perry Picture GEORGE FREDERICK HANDEL ly found expression in writing oratorios. An oratorio resembles an opera in its telling of a dramatic story to the accompaniment of music. The oratorio, however, is usually based upon a sacred theme and the message of inspiration is delivered without a scenic background, without acting, and without costumes. The chorus, the orchestra, and the solo singers perform in magnificent unity. Sometimes, in a vast audience, you may see some of the listeners close their eyes in order that the message may come to them entirely through the medium of music. Handel's oratorio, using a Biblical text, possessed a lofty grandeur new to the world of music. His Israel in Egypt, Saul, and others, won the plaudits of the English nation. But it was the Messiah that held the people speechless with its strength and beauty. Here, the story of the life of Jesus is told in the matchless poetRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE APRIL 1946 ty of the Bible, and the music carnies the words sublimely as clouds are carried across the blue heavens. It is said that when the oratorio was completed, George Frederick Handel stood in his room, a sheaf of papers in his hands. Tears streamed down his face. The door slowly opened and a servant entered. Handel turned and cried out, "I thought I did see all heaven before me and the great God himself." The gifted composer was then fifty-six years old and this was the climax of his career, the high point of achievement. Although he could not then foresee the future, he realized, to some extent at least, that he had written immortal music. The narrative of the Messiah begins with the ancient prophecy, "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people. Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem... The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness." (Isaiah 40:1-3). These words are sung by tenor. The chorus takes up the refrain, "And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed. The first part of the oratorio tells the story of the birth of Jesus, using the words of St. Luke to describe the shepherds "abiding in the field." With a joyous refrain, the chorus repeats the glowing words, "Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given... And the government shall be upon his shoulder...." But the joyous phrases of the holy birth fade away as the story of Christ's life upon earth is unfolded. With shadowed intonations, the alto soloist sings the heart-breaking aria, "He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief...." And the AN ARIA FOR EASTER tenor takes up the dark measures, "Behold and see if there be _ SOTrow like unto his sorrow. THEN, from the shadows that precede the dawn, there comes the message of the resurrection, the thythm of new life, the measure of springtime, the eternal resurgence of the spirit. In words more clear than the tones of a bell, more lucid than falling water, the soprano sings, "I. Know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth......" This is the beloved Easter aria, words of hope and comfort, words that have sustained the followers of Christ for centuries. These are the Biblical words that were treasured long before Handel set them to mu- 231 sic. Yet, with Handel's spacious talent, these words have acquired an added luster, a brighter illumination. The exquisite words are sung against a background of violin music more elusive and beautiful than the gray dawn shadows that dissolve into the opal morning. One feels the ineffable unity of this earth, its past, its present, and the ages tocome. One feels that this earth is but a part of the vastness of creation. The treasured words of the Easter aria fall in silver cadence, each note a jewel. "But now is Christ risen from the dead, the first fruits of them that slept." It is a majestic thing to remember that when Handel was an old man and the tide of his health was ebbing low, he played the organ at one of the numerous renditions of HANDEL AND GEORGE I OF ENGLAND From a Painting by Hamman 232 the Messiah in England. He had been blind for many years, but he could not give up his music. Especially he could not live without touching the organ keys to make them speak the message of faith and hope. On this occasion, the skilled hands of the master musician stopped in the middle of a phrase. He trembled and almost fell from the seat. Ina few moments he recovered his powRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE APRIL 1946 ers and finished playing the accompaniment with his accustomed grandeur. But that was the last time his fingers touched an organ. On Saturday, April 14, 1759, early in the morning, the man who composed the Messiah was himself wrapped in sleep. He lies with EngJand's honored ones in the vast crypts of Westminster Abbey. His spirit lives forever in his unrivalled music. WHEN THE CHOIR BROADCASTS Ruth H.

Faith Is a Heritage Christie Lund Coles CHAPTER I on the wooden washboard and brushed a wayward curl from her forehead. Then she stepped noiselessly to the door leading to the front room which was both livingroom and bedroom. She smiled gently at the sight of her small daughter sleeping soundly, one arm thrown above a tousled, dark head. "You Angel," she whispered, kissing the pink cheek. Rising, she placed her hands on her hips to say, "T'm thinking you get to look more like your father every minute." As she went out into the April sunshine, with the blue skies overhead and the spring sunlight falling upon the expectant earth, she laughed with the sheer joy of living. A song found her lips as she took each piece of clothing, shook it, then pinned it upon the clothesline. A neighbor, hanging clothes across a high board fence, called, "One thing, it'll soon dry in this sunshine." Enid called back, "Yes, isn't it wonderful?" The other woman looked at her rather sharply, "I can't say it's so wonderful. Mud to be tracked in and out of the house... This sudden thaw. Wait till your baby can run in and out by herself. And wait till you get a couple more to wash and iron for." Then, as a last gloomy thought, she added, as she turned to enter the house, '""There's death in this weather, too, if you ask me." |e ID piled her starched clothes But Enid did not let her neighbor's pessimism spoil her day. She was twenty-three, she had a husband whom she loved and who loved her. She was strong and well and had the most beautiful baby in the world... She thought of these things as she cleaned up the large, old-fashioned kitchen before starting to set the table. Yet, catching herself pausing in her work, she thought, "I have no time to be dreaming even though it is wise to be counting my blessings. I must dress Sharon and feed her so she will be sweet for her adoring Daddy." There was none too much time. She was just wiping the last crumb from the small girl's mouth when she heard Tom's footsteps on the porch.. She would know the swift, strong sound of them any place. She hurriedly took Sharon up and rushed forward to meet him as he came in... Large and brown and smiling. Her husband, her Tom, her world... "Enid, Doll," he called her, taking her chin in his hand to tilt her face upward for his kiss. 'Then, to the baby, "If it isn't my big girl. Come here, you blue-eyed rascal." "Wonder where she gets those beautiful blue eyes?" Enid asked archly, looking at him from under dark, heavy lashes. "Now I wouldn't have the slightest idea," he returned laughingly, Page 233 taking the sixteen-months-old baby into his arms and Hfting her to his shoulder where she was carried into the two-room apartment which they were renting because it was the only thing available. As Enid served the meal which she had put into tlie oven before hang-ing her clothes, Tom said, '1 like washday. I know we'll have scal-loped potatoes." '' Andtoday, fruit cobbler," she told him . ''No kidding? Whatever did I do to deserve this?" He shook his head in wonderment at his good fortune, then his eyes became grave and his voice serious as he looked at her, say-ing, "Someday, Enid, and soon, we'll be building our own home. We won't live here very long. You'll have everything you want, be the finest lady in Pleasant View. I'm in line to become foreman at the fac-tory. By n ineteen twenty-nine I'll probably be the chief engineer." He toyed with his fork. "I'll be a good foreman. I won't drive the men like Hutchins does. There'll be fewer accidents, too . . . b etter work." "I'm not worried about your mak-ing good, Tom. Iknow you'll suc-ceed. But, as far as I'm concerned, I have everything I want right now. If I thought being the finest lady in town would make me any less hap-py, I wouldn't want to be that." She had served the cobbler as she spoke. Tasting it, he said, "This is mighty good. Mighty good, in-deed." After a moment he took up the thread of their conversation, "Yes, Enid, we have many good things. Maybe the best part of life is when you are young and full of dreams, full of faith in the future. Even so, I'll be glad to get you out of these two furnished rooms, trade a few of our dreams for some brick and mortar, a sunny bay window. You are going to have the best of everything." "Don't you think that might be a little bit selfish?" she teased, ad-ding soberly, "I think what you said first is right. Dreams and faith are the things men live by. Especially faith." He got up from the table, looked down at her fondly, "Be sure to keep your faith in me. Sweetheart. And in the future." WHEN the clothes had been gathered in and the dishes done and put away, Enid put on a clean voile dress, brushed her hair, and with the baby in her cart, started toward town to do her shopping. The people she met on the street were friendly. Though she was a comparative stranger, she knew most of them. Those she didn't know, however, knew her because her hus-band had lived here when he was a boy. His parents had been among the leaders of the church and the community. She thought, as she walked along, that it was strange that both of them should be orphans, without any near relatives. Her par-ents had died when she was quite a young child and she had been reared by an aunt in Salt Lake who had been very good to her. She was dead now, too, and both of Tom's parents had died during the flu epidemic when he was thirteen. Her heart yearned tenderly over him as she thought of him left alone with aging grandparents. She thought of his bewilderment and his hurt. It seemed even greaterFAITH IS A HERITAGE than her own because she had been so young. She must make up to him for his loss, for the years he had to work to get through school.

But Sharon changed that. Have it any different, not for worlds. The grocer was most kind when time," speaking about her as she left the id, "That's. Tom Drage's wife. Isn't she pretty?" The other answered, "Yes. We'll have to ask her to join our sewing club.� She walked hoe, unaware that the cloud had gathered overhead and a few large raindrops were beginning to fall. Rain, wind, cloud�it was still a beautiful day. ENID was rolling Tom's socks to put in his drawer when she heard a knock on the door. Rising to open it, she saw the tall gaunt woman from whom they rented standing in the doorway. She hoped they had done nothing to displease her. She was not married, and certainly not being too occupied in her own full life. "Miss Nobbit," she greeted her, �Do come in," 235 The other woman looking at her oddly for a long second. Enid felt the blood move to her face as she wondered again what could account for the unprecedently, kindly, "My dear, you must be brave...." Then, her words falling swiftly over one another, "They just phoned me from the sugar factory. Something happened to your husband. You musn't look 'like that, child, Here, let me get you a drink," way under her. She found herself on the bed, dazed and trembling, her breath coming fast, "He... He�Wasn't...?" She couldn't say the word, but Miss Nobbitt said, honestly, "I don't know. They told me they were bringing him home." Suddenly, Enid got to her feet, tan to the window. She could see several men carrying an improvised stretcher upon which lay a still, oh, an alarmingly still figure. Tom's figure, She heard Miss Nobbit say, "I've Phoned for the Doctor. He should be here any minute." She heard herself saying, "Thank you..." as her feet started toward the door, toward the street.... But, instead of going out, she suddenly turned and ran into the kitchen. Once there, she fell to her knees, buried her face in her hands, crying, "Oh, God, please give me strength. Give me strength. Please let him be all right," adding, almost grudgingly, "If it be thy will.. Please..." 236 When she returned to the room her face was paper-white but she carried her head bravely and her voice was almost calm as she said to the men, "Put him there, please. And do be careful." When they had laid his unconscious body on the bed, one of them awkwardly tried to explain that he had been trying to save time and, instead of stopping the machinery to adjust a belt, had tried to push it on with his foot. He had been caught in the horrible wheels. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE APRIL 1946 She shuddered as she thought of it. Somehow, she remembered his words that if he were foreman he wouldn't drive the men... She knelt beside him, stroked back his hair from the quiet forehead. She whispered, "Tom, Tom, darling. It's Enid...." But he did not hear her, and somehow, as she heard the doctor at the door, she knew with a dreadful certainty that he was dead.

A Perry Picture "CHRIST AND THE HOLY WOMEN" From a Painting by Golz The Infallible Spirit Etta Mai Scott "Help us, O Lord our God; for we rest on thee" (II Chronicles 14:11). WHEN this statement was made, Asa saw himself confronted by a vast army, steeds, and chariots, with no sign of any reinforcements to come to his relief. Holding his own in the face of all of this, was a feat he felt that he could not attain. Therefore, he turned to the Lord and made entreaty. Asa's problem was only the case of the normal human being confronted with tragedy. We rush out to battle with our fears, and just as long as we have them under control, or as long as we are sure we have reinforcements to back us up, we move along at a gallant pace. But just let the walls of sorrow, grief, or despair confront us, let the wall of friendship, with which we thought ourselves surrounded, crumble, and our fortunes disappear, and we find ourselves lost and dazed. Then it is that we, like Asa, turn our eyes toward God that great infallible Father to whom a flood of prayers is constantly ascending, that great Power whose word can stay the waves, move mountains, and calm the troubled souls of men. If only we would keep our eyes fixed upon him all the time instead of calling in our hour of distress: "Help us, O Lord our God; for we rest on thee." Page 237 There is Truth Eva Willes Wangsgaard
PROVIDENCE has a way of seeing that we get the right mates, if we're obedient. Anyway, that's how it was with Henry and me.
My father wanted me to marry Eph Wilson, and Brother Matt Wilson, Eph's father, was as eager as mine to see us make a go of it. I suppose they felt that a friendship at the as theirs could yield only good fruit.
When father asked me, "Why don't you like Eph, Elvira?" all I could say was, "He has big feet and he dances like a clodhopper," but Eph had more serious faults than that. My granddaughters would call him a wolf. You see, a girl couldn't tell her father that.
It mattered about the dancing though, too. Glory! How I loved to dance! Just the twang of a fiddle set my blood to leaping like a mountain brook. It still does.
But there was one reason why I enjoyed being squired around by Eph, and that was Melissa Bates. There was a girl for you, and she was wild about Eph. It wasn't just spite in me either. I had an old score to pay off with that young lady. See my hand. That scar. Still puckers my palm. Well, I owe that to her. Pushed me against a stove. She claimed it was an accident, but I saw her eyes.... But that's another story.
The best dance of the year was held on a midwinter's night, and the man you went with was supposed to be the one and only. We began to plan for a high after Christmas, and
the year I met Henry I had decided that I was going to have a new calico dress for that party. Mother had given me my first pair of boughten shoes, I mean, the first pair that had been made back East. They had shiny pointed toes and high heels and high tops. They were elegant and I was proud of them.
A calico dress wasn't bad, even for February, when you remember that we made our dresses with tight-fitting basques and lined them and had very full skirts. I knew I'd be happy in a new calico, much as I'd love a silk or velvet.
Sister Comer, out at the flour mill, needed a girl for two or three weeks, so I went to work for her, helping to cook for the mill hands and caring for her family and doing general housework. When I visited at home, Mother and I planned the new dress. But I couldn't see my way clear to getting hoops for it. I was earning two dollars a week, and that was good pay, too, but hoops cost four or five dollars and so would the calico, so how could I get both?
One night I was sitting by the Franklin stove in Mother's sewing rocker, crocheting lace, when father said, "Elvira, I suppose you'll be going to the big dance with Eph."
I felt panicky. Eph? The big dance? Suddenly I shouted, "No!"
Father went white and got up and strode outside. When he came back in, he said, "I've been figuring, and I think I'll be able to get the hoops for your dress." 
THERE IS TRUTH I looked up at him so relieved and happy that I must have shone. He fumbled for words before he added, "That is, if you'll consent to go with Eph." I laughed and hugged him and promised. How I did regret that promise! It was the very next day that I met Henry. I had two buckets of water I had just drawn from the well. I looked up from the windlass, and there stood a young man by the corner of the mill. He was bareheaded, his hair thick and yellow as wild currants, fit to dazzle my eyes. I stood with my mouth open staring like a little girl at her first boughten doll. Then I caught myself and turned away, my face burning clear back to my ears. But Henry called out, minute." So I stopped, and he came up to me and said, "You must be Elvira Lowham. My brother says you are working for his wife. I'm Henry Comer, Jim's brother, and I've come to live with them. Here, let me take that water." HE lifted both buckets. "They're too heavy for you," he said. "Jiminy cricket! You're no bigger than a linnet. Honest, are you seventeen? Jim says you are." I owned up to being seventeen and he carried the water into the house. But we didn't see much of each other after that, for all we worked so close together. We were too busy. But we did get snatches of talk now and then, evenings after the dough was set. Sometimes we stood out by the well, looking at the stars and the snow and the cold hills. I told him about the big dance 239 and found out that he was Crazy about dancing, too, and that he would be there. He wanted me to go with him, but there was my promise to father, and what could I do? Nobody was ever sorrier about a bargain than I was over that one. But how else could I get the hoops for my dress? I didn't lie awake nights, though, much as I was scheming and figuring. When you're up at five-thirty of a morning and are kept busy washing dishes, scrubbing floors, and bending over washtubs you're glad to hit the pillow at night, and you go to bed to sleep. My! My! But I hardly got a chance to see how pretty the sun was, shining on the snow, unless I was out after water or hanging out clothes. The Comers had a little boy, David, who was a joy to be around. The first day I came he treated me like a guest, taking me to see a tree that he said was a "tree-apple" because it had apples on before the snow came. He showed me the mill and the well. He was a happy little coot, in spite of his solemn talk and his grown-up ways. Henry adored him. He told me once that heaven could offer a man no greater blessing than a son like David. So the days went by and I was contented seeing Henry at meals, and sometimes in the evenings. I decided that it was better to go to the dance with Eph and get a few turns with Henry than to miss both, and I kept busier than corn in a poppet. First thing I knew, Mrs. Comer's niece came to help her and I was free to go home, and there were only three days left before the dance. Wilson's store had a piece of red calico with small figures of blue, 240 black, and white. I bought that because red was my color, what with my dark curls and brown eyes. I got some big black buttons, too. The colors in our calico were much harder than in the prints we buy now, but I thought that was pretty. It was, too, lots prettier than homespun. Mother was a good hand with the needle and she helped me cut out and fit the dress. But stitching at night by the unsteady flame of a small coal-oil lamp made doing a good job difficult, especially with so little time, and I was hard pressed to get my dress done. Fact is, I didn't get the buttonholes worked. I just cut them and hoped that, what with the lining, they'd hold, and what with the big buttons, they wouldn't show. But the worst of it was that the afternoon of the dance it started to snow, and by evening it had whipped up into a right smart storm. The dance hall was a good two miles from our home, and father began to worry. He kept window-watching the weather, and finally, he said, "Elvira, my girl, it looks as if there'd be no dancing for you tonight." I looked up from the dishes I was washing and turned toward him, "Why not?" He said, "Look at the weather." "Who cares about the weather?" I asked, and slashed at a plate that was already clean. "I do," said father, "you can't go out in that blizzard. You'd freeze." I began to cry and said, ""Why did I work that hard all those weeks? And what is there to live for?" and a lot of other things. Then I went out the back door to throw out the dishwater. The wind nearly tore the pan from my hands. I returned and RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE APRIL 1946 pushed the door shut by backing up hard against it, and wiped the dishpan and hung it up. FATHER said, "You're not going out in that storm tonight." His gray eyes were getting narrower and narrower and he'd begun to twist his heavy black forelock. I began to be afraid that I really would have to stay at home. So I began to pet and coax. Finally, he picked up a chair and set it down hard and said, "'All right. If you can stand out in that weather for five minutes, I'll let you go to the dance." Whew, it was cold! And the wind! I could barely pull the door to behind me, but I did, and I went out and stayed out. I couldn't tell how long five minutes was and I didn't dare to go back in for fear it would be too soon and I'd lose out. Father gave in first. He came out after me. So I got ready for the dance. I slipped on my new red calico and stood on a chair to see, by the mirror in mother's dresser, how the hoops hung. I climbed down and did a turn or two to view the tips of my new shoes before I calmed down and began to pin up my side curls and to coax my bangs to lie flat. I rubbed a little of the over-bright color of my cheeks down with a stolen pinch of mother's precious potato starch. After awhile Eph came and mother gave us some bricks she had warmed and wrapped for my feet, and I put on my heavy coat. We had quilts and robes, and the going wasn't so bad. Anyway, when I was off to a dance, I was too excited to feel cold. THERE IS TRUTH But on the road I kept scheming for a way to get a little extra time with Henry. I thought and thought so much that I didn't notice when we drew up in front of the dance hall, till the team stopped and Eph made ready to hop down and help me out. I felt his big hand on my shoulder and reacted without thinking. I gave a little kick at just the wrong time at just the wrong angle. He caught his foot in my hoops and down he went sprawling onto the snow where the horses had trampled it hard. I scrambled down to help him, and there, in a strip of light from the doorway, stood Melissa. The sight of her gave me an idea. Melissa lived only a short way from the hall; she was crazy over Eph. What a set-up! I knelt down and began to make over Eph. I knew he wasn't injured, but Melissa didn't, and she'd give anything to walk into that party with Eph, or, at least, to keep me from doing it. Melissa was beside us instantly and was helping Eph to his feet. She put her hand on his head, feeling for the bump. I stole a peek at the folks gathered around, and there was Henry, so I couldn't say another word. Besides, Eph was in tender hands, and capable ones, too. More capable than I knew. Melissa said, "Elvira, you can't do anything more to help. Why not go inside out of the cold? I'll take Eph over home. It's so near. I'll get him fixed up a little." She looked at Henry. "Do you know each other? I suppose not. Mr. Comer, may I present Miss Lowham? Perhaps, you wouldn't mind escorting her inside. That's a dear." And that settled 240 it for Melissa and Eph, and, I thought, for me and Henry, too. But I didn't know Henry. He crooked his arm and I took it and we hurried into the hall where the fiddlers were striking up a polka. I was thrilled! I do believe that if the lamps had been suddenly blown out, no one would have missed their light for the shine of me. And then I caught Henry's eyes. They were as cold and forbidding as winter seas. He danced the first number with me, as it was his duty to do, but after that he kept as far away as the hall allowed. I tried not to show how it hurt, and I danced madly, a polka, a schottische or two, and a quadrille. We were tripping a varsovienne when Eph came in with Melissa. He had a headache, mostly plain temper, and he was dour as a camel. He danced a little, but not with me. Mostly he sat on a bench and sulked. I saw Melissa arguing with Henry. After a time she came to me and said, "Eph isn't feeling well and wants to go home, but he doesn't want to disturb your pleasure. Mr. Comer will take care of you," and she was gone before I could say a thing. SOME fellow swung me off in a Virginia reel and it was then that the accident happened. He caught his finger in one of my unfinished buttonholes and made a rip in my basque. I grabbed it and held it together while I ran for my coat. When Henry asked if I wanted to go home, [T had no choice but to go with him, bad as he had treated me. All the way home all he'd sav was. "Yes." "Wiel" "No." When he got out to lift me down 242 from the sleigh I asked him pointblank what had come over him. He said, "Miss Lowham, there is truth and there isa lie. One is good and the other is bad, and a man lives by his choice of the two. It's like a fork in the road. You can take the one on the right or the one on the left, but there is no middle way." He climbed into the sleigh and drove off without a glance at me, and I stood there in the path, realizing now why Melissa had been bossing Henry around all night. They had come together and he had been standing in the shadow when Melissa stood in the light. He had seen and heard the whole show I had put on over Eph and had seen through it. I just stood and wondered how much shame and misery a_ heart could hold and still beat, and then I turned and went into the house. One thing I gained, I was rid of Eph. Melissa took care of him for me for life. They were married the very next month with a big reception and everything. Henry was at the party, but he might as well have been in Klondike, so great was the coldness and distance in him. I tried to act merry, but I made a sorry mess of it. Father thought that it was losing Eph that kept me low, because he knew nothing about me and Henty. I�ll say this for him, though, he didn't give me one word of censure. Spring came, and the spring dances, and I went with a different fellow every time, but even the dancing had lost its fun. Then the news came about the Comers. David had scarlet fever. Mrs. Comer's niece had got scared and gone home and left Mrs. Comer sick herself and with no help. I told Mother that I was going back, and I went. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE APRIL 1946 When I walked into the Comer house everything was at sixes and sevens, dishes piled on the table, floors dirty, beds tumbled, and Mrs. Comer, who was so ill she should have been in bed herself, was fussing over David. "Why, Elvira," she said and lit up with relief. Then her face clouded and she said, "But it's catching, you know, unless you've had it. Have you?" I hurried into the kitchen before she could go into details. For two weeks I was too busy to know that I was alive. The men weren't staying at home, so there weren't the heavy meals and housework to do, but David was very sick, and Mrs. Comer was too weak to help much. The little shaver grew worse and we were afraid that he couldn't pull through. I prayed and prayed, silently, as I worked. My heart ached, and when there wasn't something pressing to be done I went into the kitchen and washed. I washed until there was nothing left with a speck of soil on it, and the time went by. The doctor came every day and I tried to do everything that he ordered as well as a nurse would have done, if we could have found a nurse, and finally David began to improve. The fever went away and he lay, a small white ghost of himself, and my throat ached when I looked into his great dark eyes. "Vira," he'd say, "tell me a tory." And I told him all the wee-wee stories I knew and made up others. When I'd say, "I don't know any more, David," he'd say, "Shing to me then." And I'd sing even when the deep notes came out more like sobs. And when his appetite was so  light that it wouldn't fit a hummingbird, Fd p lay imaginary games with him. The day that I felt certain that he was safe, I went into my room and cried as I had never dared to cry before. Soon, both the mother and child were well and I wasn't needed any longer, and I went home. I was feeling sort of queer. The next morning I had a sore throat and it got more and more raw, and I became very ill. I don't know which hurt worse, my throat or the knowledge that now Henry would know that I had taken the wrong road ag a in. I hadn�t and scarlet fever, but I had it now. I w as so miserable that I wanted to die, but I began to get well disappointingly soon. One day, when I had recovered completely, I was out in the back yard washing clothes when mother came to the back door and called, "There's a young man to see you, Elvira." I shook my hands out of the water and didn't even stop to roll down my sleeves or slick up my hair as I passed the kitchen mirror. What did it matter? It was only one of the town boys after a date for the week-end dance. I strode into the parlor, and stopped dead still and pulled frantically at my sleeves. There stood Henry. "Oh! It's you," I said and made such an effort not to show surprise that the words came out flat, as if my whole life wasn't standing there by the parlor door, and yet completely out of my reach. Henry fidgeted and looked at his hat twirling round and round on his fist. He almost looked at me once, but dropped his eyes quickly, and finally he said, "I've come to apologize." "What for?" I blurted. Henry looked up from his hat, but his glance fell again to the copper toes of my work shoes. At last the words came in a rush, "I said, once, that there is truth, and there is a lie. One is good and the other is bad and a man lives by his choice of the two. I claimed that there was no middle road, and I didn't expect to think different, ever. But I know now that I didn't have the whole truth. Nothing is bad that saves a life." He gulped. I felt so sorry for him that I stepped closer. His fingers reached out and tightened and he drew me to him. "Oh, Elvira," he said, "we've wasted so much time!" My lips touched his cheek and I tasted tears; I couldn't tell whether they were mine or Henry's. It didn't matter. Everything was all right now, and it always would be. 244 THE MERRILL LOCUST TREE Rebecca Merrill Ostler My thoughts go back to the little house Of long remembered days, In dear simplicity it stood With unpretentious ways; And yet it was a restful place, Beneath the locust's shade, The spreading branches guarded well The home my parents made. I long for that old locust tree And for the birds to sing  My father often rested there In early days of spring.

Our Number One Enemy Cancer Compiled by the Field Army, Utah Division of the American Cancer Society HAT is cancer? Cancer is not a disease. It is the wild growth of lawless "gangster" cells that infiltrate the surrounding area and, if not treated or removed in time, "metastasize" (that is, break off and travel in the bloodstream or in the lymphatic fluids to other positions, where they set up in business again). The result is death to the individual by interference with vital organs, either at the site of the original growth or at a new site after metastasis. We dread cancer above all other diseases. Therefore, it stands rightly among the causes of suffering and death as mankind's Number One Enemy. Every year scientific advances make it possible to save more people from cancer. Every year we grow older, however, cancer increases as a personal danger. The race between these two factors is the vital thing which concerns us. Weare concerned with it in every age of life. Even among babies, children, and youths, cancer takes an appalling toll. This year it will kill nearly 2,000 American boys and girls who will never live to see their twenty-first birthday. Statistics indicate that between the ages of five and nineteen years, cancer kills more children than all of the following diseases combined: scarlet fever, infantile paralysis, typhoid fever, meningitis, peritonitis, diphtheria, dysentery, diarrhea, and malaria. One in every six deaths among people of middle age is caused by cancer. Even among the aged, cancer is not as high a cause of death proportionately. Thus, a vast number of cancer's victims are stricken when still at the height of their powers fathers and mothers with dependent children, men and women whom society and business can least spare. The Facts We Must Face The proportions of the cancer tragedy are shocking. Cancer killed 607,000 Americans between Pearl Harbor and V-J Day  more than twice as many as were slain by the Germans and Japs. Right now, cancer is killing 175,000 Americans a year 478 every day twenty every hour one every three minutes. Cancer is the greatest killer of American women between the ages of thirty-five and fifty-four the second greatest killer of American men. In America today, it is estimated conservatively that more than 700,000 persons are suffering from cancer, and the total may approach 1,000,000. Yet, we can face with real hope facts even as terrible as these. When detected in time and treated effectively, cancer can be cured in a large proportion of cases. In ninety-five per cent of the cases, cancer of the skin or lip can be cured in its early stages cancer of the breast or uterus in seventy-five per cent of the cases, if treated in time. It is estimated Page 245 246 that, on the basis of present knowledge alone, from thirty per cent to fifty per cent of all cancer can be cured through early recognition and effective treatment. For our nation as a whole, the cancer death rate is still alarmingly on the increase. But in those communities or among certain groups or citizens, where people have learned to recognize the danger signals of cancer and have proper facilities for treatment to which they turn quickly, cancer death rates are beginning to go down. For instance, one of our large insurance companies recently reported, for the first time, a definite downward trend in the cancer death rate among its white industrial policy holders over an entire decade. We ought to be turning the tide, however, not just for a part of our people, but for all of our people. This year, due largely to the efforts in which the American Cancer Society has played a leading part, the lives of 30,000 Americans will be saved from this terrible disease. But at least another 50,000 will die needlessly. They will die mainly because they lacked the knowledge to seek help early enough, or did not get the treatment they needed. We also have failed so far to do as much as we should to relieve the terrible suffering of those who cannot be saved and to increase constantly the proportion of those with good hope of salvation, through an adequate program of research. What We Must Do. We must press a comprehensive and relentless attack against cancer, upon all fronts through education, adequate treatment, and_ research. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE APRIL 1946 To do this, we need, first of all, an effective means for organizing and directing the fight against cancer. The basis for such an organization was laid in 1913 with the founding of the American Cancer Society. Although handicapped by insufficient funds, it pioneered the educational program which proved that an ever-increasing number of lives can be saved. The American Cancer Society now has enlisted the highest leadership, both medical and lay, that can be had. Last year it established a beachhead for a really comprehensive attack on cancer. With the aid of the National Research Council, it began the organization of a far-reaching program of cancer research. This year, it plans not only greatly to increase its research, but to increase facilities for the treatment of cancer patients. It is essential that people learn to consult a doctor at the first sign of possible cancer and that new and better ways to fight cancer be found through research. People must have places to turn for effective treatment. No matter what programs the government may propose for the study of cancer, there remains the need for private institutions to carry on cancer and other related basic research. In order to make a real start toward providing better care for cancer patients, the goal of the American Cancer Society this year is to raise $12,000,000. Utah's goal is $35,700.00.

A. Hunter presiding. After the usual opening exercises, President Hunter made a few opening remarks, during which Sisters Presendia Kimball and Helen Mar Whitney arrived from Salt Lake City. Sister Kimball was the first speaker. She gave a great deal of good counsel and advice, suitable to all the saints, both old and young. Sister Whitney spoke very interestingly, with remarks to suit all, and encouraged all to live up to their privileges, for we live in very critical times. ****Sisters Kimball and Whitney stopped all the week and visited and cheered the sisters for they were full of blessings, and on Saturday returned home to the city.

PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT: There is almost no limit to the physical development and health that may be gained and maintained by walking that is done for the purpose of exercise. Any one can find time and space in which to walk, and one can find congenial company for such trips. A prospective husband is not the best company at such times, for with him the walk will almost inevitably degenerate into a saunter; further, no woman can walk freely when custom or affection compels her to lean upon a masculine arm. To be beneficial, walking must be done in shoes broad enough to let the feet be placed firmly upon the ground at every step, and in clothing which will allow free play to the lungs and arms. The step should be as quick as can be maintained without causing uncomfortable increase in the action of the heart. The pedestrian should breathe through the nose, carry the head erect, and not be afraid of being high shouldered.

Cannon ITH famine, disease, and injustice still stalking the world, we are confronted at every turn with sharp reminders of that second great commandment of Jesus to love. One's neighbor as oneself. The people of America have done a valiant work in relieving suffering; but must we not come yet closer to the literal following of the Savior's pattern for living? RS. ELEANOR ROOSEVELT, our country's one woman delegate to the United Nations Organization conference in London, said, after traveling in Germany, that if people wanted to know the reason for the UNO, they should have a look at conditions in Germany. NORA WALN, Atlantic Monthly correspondent in the American zone in Germany, writes that out of 2866 births in August, 1148 deaths occurred, the principal cause being lack of food for mothers or babies. ANY young people in France have only half the daily amount of calories considered essential to health. A reputable French doctor believes that ninety-five per cent of the young people of Paris have tuberculosis. The French infant mortality rate is thirty-three per cent. The Chinese, East Indians, Malayans, and Filipinos have suffered excessively and still hunger. In India, in 1943, three million died of starvation. The present famine there is expected to be even worse. UTAH, since becoming a state in 1896, has had eight governors, including the present executive. The wives of four ex-Governors are still living. A fifth, Mrs. Charles R. Mabey, is only recently deceased. The surviving ladies, all widows, are: the State's first first-lady, Mrs. Heber M. Wells (1896-1904); Mrs. William Spry (1909-1917); Mrs. George H. Dern (1925-1933); Mrs. Henry Blood (1933-1941). S a small Indian girl, Rose Daniels, now ninety-one years old, was captured from her Navajo tribe by the Utes. As was done in many cases, the Mormons purchased her freedom. Living among her rescuers, she learned their ways. Later, married to a Ute and living on the barren reservation, she planted as the Mormons did, devising an irrigation system from the ditches, and improving her strains by working with the best seed. She has developed the only Lima bean that can be grown in the short, dry seasons of Utah, Wyoming, and South Dakota. Page 249 VOL. 33 EDITORIAL APRIL 1946 Patient in Spirit" PATIENCE is a virtue which is enjoined many times in Holy Writ upon those who would be, in reality, the children of God. It is classed with such other qualities as faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, and diligence. Patience, as an attribute of character, is extolled in the Epistle of James: Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain. Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.... Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience. Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy (James 5:7, 8, 10, 11). The "patience of Job" has come to be a common saying among men, and anyone can learn a lesson in patience from studying the life of this "perfect and upright" man. It is usually the case that one who _ habitually exercises patience has acquired this virtue from years of constant striving for its possession. Few individuals seem to be so fortunate as to be endowed with patience from Page 250 birth. It is a priceless acquisition for the wife and mother. Children rarely realize the major role which patience plays in their home life as the mother guides the daily affairs of the home. But when a daughter assumes the responsibilities of wifehood, she soon awakens to the necessity of being patient in order that her new home may be permeated with a spirit of love and understanding. With the addition of the duties and cares of motherhood, a still greater need for patience is felt. If it is difficult to be patient in one's own affairs, it is still more difficult to be patient in directing the conduct of others. Too many mothers impulsively slap or berate a child without stopping to use a more effective means of correction for the lasting benefit of the child. It also requires patience to cheerfully perform, hour after hour, day after day, month after month, the same household tasks over and over again. A spirit of patience is needed in order that joy may come from such inevitable tasks and not discontent or grumblings at the monotony and drudgery of a woman's housework. Only one who has learned by patience to curb hasty actions and govern an unruly tongue, allowing matters to proceed in a natural manner, realizes the constant surveillance he EDITORIAL must impose on himself. The tendency on the part of most people to seek to force an issue without letting the individual, properly guided, work out his own problems and thus gain invaluable experience for himself, is directly traceable to a lack of patience. Blessed is the home where patience abides as a cultivated and 251 nurtured member of the family. Blessed is any group which is presided over by one who is "patient in spirit." From an intimate association with patience one grows ever stronger in living according to the admonition of the Lord: "In your patience possess ye your souls" (Luke 21:19). MCS. Se Congratulations to President Smith ON HIS BIRTHDAY, APRIL 4th HE Relief Society General Presidency, on behalf of its world-wide membership, wishes to congratulate President George Albert Smith on the seventy-sixth anniversary of his birth. May this important milestone in his long career of outstanding service be a day of joy to him and a source of great satisfaction. We particularly remember that this is President Smith's first birthday as the President of the Church, and we wish him many more joyful anniversaries. May his health and strength be preserved, and may the prayers of the Relief Society sisters in his behalf, and their daily conduct be such as to help sustain him in his many responsibilities. May our love and appreciation go with him in his travels and abide with him in his home. May we teach our children the principles of high resolve, courage and devotion that President Smith has exemplified as a leader of his people. NOTES TO THE FIELD Relief Society No Longer to Share in the Use of the Evenings of the Stake Quarterly Conference Sundays The following letter from the First Presidency is published for the information of stake and ward Relief Society presidents: February 21, 1946 "TO: PRESIDENCIES OF STAKES GENERAL SUPERINTENDENTS AND GENERAL PRESIDENTS OF AUXILIARY ORGANIZATIONS Dear Brethren and Sisters: In a letter dated April 25, 1942, addressed to presidencies of stakes, bishops, presidents of missions, and presidents of branches, it was recommended that 'during the emergency the several stake auxiliary organizations will share in the use of the evenings of the stake quarterly conference Sundays for their stake auxiliary conferences and other programs under the assignment, direction, and discretion of the stake presidency.' At the regular meeting of the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve held January 31, 1946, it was decided, after due consideration of the matters of Sunday evening meetings held in connection with stake quarterly conferences, to advise that these meetings be given to the Young Men's and Young Women's Mutual Improvement Associations instead of being alternated among the various auxiliaries. Therefore, commencing as of this date, presidencies of stakes, superintendents and presidents of auxiliary associations will please arrange their programs in accordance with this recommendation. Regarding the holding of special auxiliary meetings in wards, we repeat the instructions heretofore given as follows: 'In the wards the Relief Society, the Sunday School, the Mutual Improvement Associations, the Primary Association, and the Genealogical Society will hold all their special meetings and annual conferences on the evenings of Page 252 Fast Sundays. The assignment of these evenings to the various auxiliaries will be made by the bishopric of the ward after consultation with the auxiliary organizations.' Sincerely your brethren, (Signed) Geo.

Then she raised her head and looked back up the dark way from whence she had come, and bewilderment seized her. Ere was she? Why was she here? All about her was darkness heavy, crushing She began to whimper as a child does when it awakens from a nightmare, and she closed her eyes and her head sang again to the ground. A familiar voice came to her echoing and re-echoing down the dark chasm. "Come back! Come back to me!" The woman recognized her mother's voice; and, at the sound, all the laughing carefree days of child- "Yes, yes, Mother!" to cry eagerly. "I am coming back." But she could not open her lips, could not move her tired body. Drowsiness her a drowsiness that numbed her senses and With difficult through a silvery mist, was a peaceful, green countryside with a cool stream winding lazily through a lush meadow. She had but to cross a small bridge and she would be in this coo] Paradise. Slowly she pulled her body over the hard ground toward the bridge, and one hand teached up and clung to the narrow railing. Again a dear voice called to her: "Come back! Come back to me!" It was the voice of her husband. The woman's head went up. Oh, she must go back! Somehow she must drag herself back up that steep Path. Her lips formed the word, "Coming!" Desperately she tried, but she could not rise, could not make her body do her will, And she was tired SO very, very tired. Suddenly, walked across the bridge she would become as strong and carefree as the child who had once raced through and rest peace such as she had never known, She raised herself up and put one foot on the bridge, As she did S0, a child's voice came to her. "Mother! Mother!" it called.   mother turned her head, and her body straightened. It was as "if the magic word, "Mother," had tapped a hidden spring of strength. Without hesitation, she turned her back on Paradise and started to climb the long, stony path to earth. Page 255 The White Picket Fence Sarah O. Moss PATRICIA hurriedly placed a half dozen card tables about her spacious living-room and spread dainty lunch cloths on each one with meticulous care. She took infinite pains with the one long table in the southeast corner and placed a centerpiece of roses in a glass bowl on the center of the lace cloth. Patricia) glanced with - satisfaction through the corner window at the majestic scene before her high, rolling mountains spread with autumn color, and then she looked at her own tailored lawns flanked by clean kept flower beds. She frowned at the broken pickets in the white fence that divided her yard from the tiny structure on the prized corner lot adjoining. "Tom," she called in a distressed voice, "you've promised me ever since that load of topsoil was delivered, that you'd fix those pickets the truck ruined, and here it is, the one day of my life when I wanted everything to be perfect and my guests will have to stare at the jagged fence. A broken fence, plus that little matchbox of a house." Tom came in from the breakfast room carrying a napkin which he laid on the hall table, as he picked up his hat. "I'll fix it tonight sure," he said, coming forward, and then, remembering, he added, "Sorry, Pat. That won't do you any good the party�ll be over." "If you only hadn't been so slow, Tom," said Patricia busying herself with the table, "we could have Page 256 owned that lot and had it all to ourselves. Now look at it." She threw him a pouty look. Tom put his arm across her shoulder, detaining her as she rushed about the room. "Say, listen," he told her firmly, "you are going to grow old hating that little house next door.. Those people have to live, too. They're a decent sort and mind their own business. I think they'll make good neighbors." Patricia gave him a wry smile. "I suppose you're night. Still, neighbors are the least of my worries. I rather enjoy being alone. But that little tiny house and those pickets, Tom, that's all Doris Banks will see if she sits at this table." Tom went toward the door. "Well, put her in front of a wall. She's nobody." "Oh, but she is, Tom," said Patricia suddenly and with firm confidence. ''She's vice-president of the Betterment League. She is important. And think of it! Mrs. Mathew James, a national figure, when it comes to civic affairs, will be here. They say she's a marvelous talker, too. I'm so glad for my lovely home, and thanks to Isabell Cottam, my party food will be perfect." "And I suppose you wear the new suit today?" said Tom with a satisfied. Smile on his face. "A swell looking president." "Uh hu, and I'll try to make time to stop in and see you," Patricia told her husband as he hurried away. There was so much to do. She THE WHITE PICKET FENCE picked up and polished silverware from the buffet and began placing it on the tables, but at the telephone's urgent tinging, she left her task to answer it in the back hall. It was Isabell Cottam on the line. Patricia's face turned red and white at intervals as she listened to a long speech from the other end. "But what shall I do, Isabell?" Patricia groaned. "Of course I'm sorry about your mother having a stroke, but goodness, I'm in a spot. I couldn't fix all that food and besides it worries me, J] get confused and my party'll be a flop." She hesitated again as she listened. "No, I don't know any of my neighbors well enough to ask them to come in and help. I've just never felt close enough to them." Again advice came from Isabell. "I wouldn't feel confident about that colored girl, Isabell. I'm sure she wouldn't know what to do if I left her as I'd planned." The conversation went on. Pa. Tricia became more discouraged the more she talked. Finally, she said. "I�ll: manage somehow, Isabell, ] know you have your hands full, and I'm terribly sorry about your mother." At last. The conversation ended. ATRICIA sat frozen to the chair in the hall. How perfectly awful! She did the only thing she felt like doing. She cried brokenly, without restraint, and her sobs shook her small body. "Is something wrong?" Patricia jumped, then, seeing the little figure from the small house, she rose to open the door, still crying. She told the neighbor as steadily as she could what had happened. "Perhaps T can help," said the 257 neighbor, who spoke with an accent. Patricia smiled. "You're kind," she said, with regret that she hadn't been more friendly through the month that the new people had lived next door. Without confidence, she led the way to the kitchen and surveyed the Prospect of creating a luncheon. "This is the menu I'd planned, but it's too elaborate. Now, let's see I'll have to stay and help. You see, I was to go to the airport to meet Mrs. James, our guest of honor, and then there was to have been a sight-seeing trip. Luncheon is scheduled for one o'clock, so I'll have to get something together that won't take too much time, or be too confusing.": She thought of all the lovely things that Isabell could make. She wished that the aged woman who was Isabell's mother had delayed having her stroke for a day. How silly! How selfish! Patricia managed to smile at her neighbor who stood waiting to start her work. "Tm sure everything will work out," said Mrs. Jarmen. But nothing was working out today. Patricia answered the telephone again, and before she had time to tell Doris about her own troubles, Doris told her that she wouldn't be able to 80 to the airport because her dressmaker who had altered her suit had to take out the hem. "It's just a half inch too long and you know what a half inch in a hem can do toa suit," she told Patricia. Patricia swayed. Doris, who was vice-president of the Betterment League, -couldn't go to the airport. That meant Patricia had to go. But the luncheon! What a morning! Patricia went back into the kitchen. 258 "I'll have to dress right now," she told Mrs. Jarmen. "Order some Parker House rolls from the bakery." She thought of Isabell's beaten biscuits. "And order some ice cream chocolate, from the Sherbet Shop. When I get back we'll make a salad of that chicken and some hot chocolate. If you'll wash the lettuce and drain it, and prepare the chickens, ['ll run and dress." Patricia vanished. She dressed quickly, then hurried down to pack out the car. She remembered that she hadn't taken time to properly thank Mrs. Jarmen for her proffer of help. She rushed back into the house.. "Mrs. Jarmen, you're like a Christmas gift. I don't understand how you happened along when you did. 1 do appreciate what you're doing." Patricia looked at the calm face before her. "Well, don't worry, Mrs. Wright. I'm glad that I didn't go out to work today." Her Mona Lisa smile disturbed Patricia. She felt that the woman was laughing at her. "I�ll get back as soon as I can," she told Mrs. Jarmen, with small spirit. "And will you order the tolls at once, and the ice cream?" Mrs. Jarmen waved and nodded. PATRICIA arrived at the airport with five minutes to wait, but when the plane arrived Mrs. James was not on it. "She's probably on a special plane that's due in half an hour," the clerk at the window told her. "A delegation of some sort is coming through." He proved to be right. Mrs. James was among the passengers. She was very charming, and Patricia was glad RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE APRIL 1946 when she expressed a desire to go directly to her hotel to freshen up. That would give Patricia an hour extra, and by that time Doris ought to be free to take over. She could take Mrs. James around the town, and the luncheon might turn out right after all. But nobody had figured on the press. Judy Raymond knew about Patricia's party and wanted to make the most of it for her society page. She talked long and freely to Mrs. James and seemed to take ages to get the proper pictures. If she'd only hurry. At an opportune interval, Patricia slipped to a telephone booth and called her home. "Did you get the order in for the rolls?" was her first concert, as Mrs. Jarmen answered. "No, we were too late for special orders, and the ice cream delivery doesn't get up this way in time for lunch, but I can make some biscuits Mrs. Wright. Don't worry." Worry! The woman didn't know what she was saying. The worry was sending her frantic. "I�ll pick up the ice cream, or run down for it, after I get home. I'm delayed, but I'll come as soon as I can." She didn't wait to hear what Mrs. Jarmen was saying. She couldn't wait. Mrs. James was looking for her. She was probably tired and was anxious to clean up. It was twenty minutes to one when Patricia finally turned the job over to Doris. She breathed a sigh of relief when she at last reached her own yard and rushed in through the back hall. She raced up the stairs to find a pretty apron, and, smelling the brown of hot biscuits, she conjectured what they might look like. Would they be big, family THE WHITE PICKET FENCE size discs, or what? Well it couldn't matter now. Things couldn't be any worse. With freshened face and a dainty apron, she went down the front stairs. She stood breathlessly still at the scene before her. The tables gleamed with beautiful creations  salad that looked like an advertisement, made of melon balls, cantaloupe, and grapes. Jellies in dainty dishes, rosebud radishes, and olives looked invitingly tempting to Patricia, as she came down the stairs and into the roomy kitchen. Mrs. Jarmen was bending over a huge pan of dollar-size hot bread, crusty and golden. On the stove stood the hot chocolate ready to pour. Chicken a la king was waiting to be served, and the concoctions in the other dishes Patricia couldn't name. On the table stood rows and rows of dainty tarts, her own menu carried out more elaborately even than she had dreamed. Patricia was overwhelmed. "Mrs. Jarmen," she said accusingly, "you should have told me you were a cateress." Mrs. Jarmen spread her honest looking smile across her features. "No need," she said, "that's the fun of having neighbors finding out about them." "It's all so lovely," said Patricia, 259 now understanding the Mona Lisa smile. Mrs. Jarmen had wanted to surprise her and she had succeeded famously. "How I can ever make this up to you will take me the rest of my life to figure out. You're a dear," she said as the doorbell rang and she went with pride to answer it. It was seven o'clock when Patricia stood by her kitchen window looking into the yard next door. She had already thought of a dozen ways she might show her appreciation to Mrs. Jarmen. The two girls might as well have the use of the piano that stood in the hall, so they wouldn't have to walk six blocks to the home of an aunt each day to practice. They must be persuaded to use the library upstairs, too, for their school work. She'd make Mrs. Jarmen an afghan and perhaps 'Tom could take Mr. Jarmen on a fishing trip. Tom spoiled her reverie when he came into the room with a saw and a hammer. "Have you seen any nails? I need some Pat, to fix your pickets." He looked at her questioningly. Patricia smiled slightly. "Tom," she said, with a sudden thought, 'let's not fix those pickets. Let's make a gate instead. It'll be so much handier than going way around."  APPLE TREE IN APRIL Katherine Fernelius Larsen Dew-washed and fragrant, at the very edge of day She stands, glowing with the prescience of dawn. To whisper her poem to the tantalizing breeze, Then, after, scatter pink-edged pages on the lawn! Digging for Happiness Elizabeth Adamson YRA'S thoughts, as she walked home from Relief Society meeting, were a trifle confused. She had hated to tell Sister Packham that she had definitely decided she wouldn't keep on with her class lessons. And Sister Packham had been so nice about it; but her parting words traced an indelible line through Myra's mind. "I hope you'll reconsider, Myra. You'll make a wonderful teacher. Just try it once more. We all have hidden talents that give us a pleasurable surprise when we dig them out and use them. And it's surprising how much. Genuine joy and satisfaction we get in the process of digging." The last sentence, particularly, kept running through her mind, once in awhile interspersed with a remark of Tim's, "If you would only try, use a little patience. Big things aren't done in a hurry." Even Tim thought she had something that so far had failed to materialize. Myra was at her own gate. This time, instead of hurrying into the house, for some reason, she stopped to gaze about her. It's funny, she thought, I've never especially noticed how inviting Tim has made our yard. It's taken a long time to make things look like this the white arbor, the flower beds, and even the grass. It's so orderly and peaceful out here that I hate to go in. She dropped down on the grass. Her thoughts kept on. What's the difference between Tim and me? He Page 260 gets results. He's happy and contented. He seldom complains. And I am practically the opposite. Why? Myra rested her head on her arms. Could there really be some magic in trying and doing instead of just dreaming and wishing? Suddenly Myra jumped to her feet, a look of resolution in her eyes. She would give Sister Packham's and Tim's hints a thoroughly honest try. She would stop dreaming about what she would like to have and do, and really find out for herself what applied effort would bring. Immediately upon making this decision, her blood began to pulsate with new life and she was filled with the need to go into action. Her mind raced ahead to the tasks and work she had to do. As she enumerated them one by one, and the list became longer, her determination began to ebb. There was Nancy's dress to finish, dishes to wash, ironing to be done, and dinner started, besides the other tasks she had left until she felt more in the mood. Oh, there were too many things! She never could get them all done. Ig was by sheer will power that Myra commandeered her fleeing energies to stop and come back to the battle front. "For," she said aloud, "it looks as if I really do have a battle, one of habit. That must be the way I've always been. When I have a stack of things to do, I either somehow back out and do them as I feel the urge, or rush through them DIGGING FOR HAPPINESS so fast nothing is done quite right. No wonder I'm never satisfied. But not this time. I'm going to prove to myself I can do things and do them well. I will! I will! I can, especially if the Lord will help me." She pushed open the door. As she glanced at the upheaval she had left when she went to Relief Society meeting she winced. But, undauntedly, she continued to her room. Here, at least, everything was in order. Tim generally came in here to do his work, and so she had thought he didn't particularly notice the rest of the house if this room was kept spic and span. Myra changed her clothes to some she could work in. Then she knelt down to pray and ask the Lord for help in carrying out her new resolution. When she arose, her eyes traveled to the desk. Of course, she thought, a schedule is what I need. It won't make so much difference if I'm slow getting started tonight if I know exactly what I'm going to do from now on. She sat down and began her list. She put in everything, including preparation for her Relief Society lesson. When she had completed it, she was astounded at the things there were to do, especially if she did things right. There was meal-planning, housework, sewing, time for the children, and all the little things that make a home seem to run on oiled wheels. After puzzling over her problem for several minutes, she decided to divide her list into a daily program, making sure each day saw something other than routine tasks done. Eventually, she was satisfied that her program covered all her duties. 261 She considered places to put the program, and at last decided that inside the cupboard door was handiest, where no one would be likely to notice it. For awhile that was what she wanted secrecy in making herself over. Also, being in the cupboard, the schedule would always be close at hand for checking on herself. Dinner was well under way when Tim Morgan opened the door. "Um-m-m. Something smells good. What are you cooking?" he asked, by way of greeting. "Just the usual thing," Myra said, looking up at him from the finishing touches of Nancy's dress. She wanted to surprise him tonight, and anyway getting interesting meals was to be a regular feature in her schedule. "Well, that's that," said Myra as she held the dress up for a final scrutiny. "It's finished." And, to herself, added that it did look pretty and neat. At least she wasn't ashamed of this one. She'd had to do a good deal of unpicking and resewing to get it satisfactory. The feeling of something well done began to exhilarate her. It was with some constraint that she refrained from telling Tim about her decision, especially when he remarked, "Things must have gone pretty well in Relief Society today." "But they didn't. I made such a mess of the lesson. I thought maybe I would resign. I did start to. Then Sister Packham asked me to think it over again before I really said no." "She's night. You should never quit until you are absolutely certain within yourself that you cannot do the job." Tim had encouraged her 262 to take the class. He thought they both might get something out of it. Dinner was over, and Myra had completed her dishes. It had been worth the extra effort to make the steamed pudding. Tim had seemed to really enjoy everything, even though there were no remarks made. But she dreaded doing her next job  sitting down to read over her next lesson. However, she reasoned with herself, if she started now she could think about it as she went to sleep and tomorrow she would be able to locate one of the references. She settled down to her reading. While she was finding her place a few paragraphs from an article in The Relief Society Magazine caught her eye: To live affirmatively, abundantly, is possible for each of us, and to do it is a major achievement. To fill one's days with useful work, to do well the task immediately in front of one is to be happy now and to make secure the future. A well-ordered life is free from lost time, lost motion, desultory effort, and needless worry. One of the secrets of really great living is having ideals and standards and then living up to them. When we cherish lofty ideals and strive heroically to attain them, we are made both strong and happy. Even the Magazine has remarks of strength in it for me, and are applicable to me, she thought. OMETIMES it was hard for Myra to carry out her resolution. Unexpected things came up. Her old habits were very strong upon her. And on those days that she let them RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE- -APRIL 1946 conquer she was as dissatisfied as she had ever been. But, on the days that her willpower won, she always went to bed happy. She even caught herself bursting into snatches of song. Tim, too, noticed the change. At first, he said nothing. Then, as things began to be easier for her to keep up with, he asked her if she had found a new formula for living. He had never seen things quite so nice, nor her quite so happy: But Myra told him nothing. She simply smiled and resolved to carry on even more strongly. Each day, too, she devoted a few minutes to study. Her crowning point of happiness was the ease and fluency with which she was able to present her Relief Society lesson. Not once did she falter, not even during a lively discussion. Tears of joy were in her eyes when Sister Packham put her arm around her after the meeting was over and said, "I believe that was one of the very best lessons | ever participated in. You do have a real knack for explaining the lesson and drawing us out." Silently Myra thanked the Lord and prayed for more help to carry on and gain even higher success and confidence in her abilities, that she might ever enjoy the satisfaction and joy of well-earned happiness. She knew she had only just begun. There. Were many more things to overcome and accomplish. But she would continue digging for happiness, for there was a veritable and great treasure to be gained. Between the Dusk and the Dark Alice Whitson Norton 66 BETWEEN the dusk and the dark did you ever stop to think of that one hour in the day, what it means to the countless mass of people who go and come by the clock?" asked a tired little saleswoman one afternoon, of a thoughtless customer who sat at one of the lace counters in a big department store, carelessly fingering the laces. "No," said the customer, "I never thought that that particular hour could mean very much to anybody; to me it's the hour that means I must be hurrying home in order to be there when my husband gets in. He is very particular about my being in the house when he comes home." "Isn't it wonderful," responded the saleswoman, "to be waiting for a kind man at the door of a home at the twilight hour?" "Sounds well enough for one who's never experienced the feeling," laughed the customer, "but to me twilight means getting home in time to let my husband in nothing more." With that, the customer arose and made a hasty exit, and the saleswoman turned to me, who, being a customer, was awaiting my turn to be served. "Funny expression, wasn't it?" she said with a meaning nod towards the departing figure. ""That's all some people see in the twilight hour but to me " "You must love the twilight hour," I interrupted. "Love it?" she asked, "It's the Page 264 sweetest time of day to me that one hour between dusk and dark, when every home-loving person begins to seek his own shelter." This statement was new to me, and believing the young woman on the other side of the counter had a vision worth sharing, I questioned her further. "I�ll call it the ecstasy hour," she said presently, "for in that one hour of the day I honestly believe that joy rules the world. You see," she went on softly, "it's the one hour in the whole twenty-four when people seemingly leave off their troubles  the thought of going home fills their minds, and trouble and business worries are laid away. You can feel the spirit of joyousness in the crowd that jams the street-cars at the twilight hour, and in their faces you can almost read what awaits them at the end of the journey. "You'll see the tired little mother eagerly watching for the glimpse of the street lamp where she leaves the car; the weary father leans anxiously towards the little bell on the car wall three blocks before it's time to ring it. The young husband, pretentiously reading the newspaper, folds it six blocks from his stopping place. That's the street-car side of it. Of course, that's a very small part now, for so many folks go and come in autos and buses. Even the auto, to me," laughed the girl, "plays an important part in this home-coming hour of mine." "You are quite an observing young lady," I said, by way of response. BETWEEN THE DUSK AND THE DARK "Perhaps," she answered, "I am a little too observing but back to the home-coming hour: I happen to live in the North Street triangle apartment house, and from. My window I can view three streets, and from close observation, have learned a lot about home-comers.� �FOR instance," she continued, "I often sit at the window and watch the cars come down Long Avenue. I can tell almost at a glance just where they are going to stop. One car, with four blazing lights, turns the corner slowly, stops before the biggest house on the street; then, even more slowly than the car approached, a man gets out and drags himself wearily up the long walk. Indifferently he turns the keys in the door and goes in." "Why indifferently?" 1 asked. "Because," answered the young woman, "nobody lives there but himself." "One little two-eyed car turns the comer like an ice skater, making a curve, and rolls swiftly to the curb before a tiny house. The driver gets out and, going in, is in keeping with the movement of the car he's in a hurry to get home." "You're sure about that?" I asked. "Quite sure," she answered sweetly, "there's a wife and baby waiting for him within the little house." "Next," she went on, a bit slowly, "usually comes a small coupe. This car belongs to a business woman. She drives her cat just as cate fully as she manages her business, and doesn't stop until she's inside the garage." "Ts she in a hurry?" I questioned eagerly. 265 "No," said the saleswoman, "she is neither rushed nor slow. To her this coming home hour is just part of the busy day. 'True, she has her parents to look after when she arrives, but, having provided for their comfort before she left home in the morning, she feels no need to hurry in the evening. "Then, there is another cat " For a minute the speaker paused and I was just beginning to feel as if she were going to leave off the most important one of all, when she smiled bravely. "I know it," she continued softly, "the instant it turns the curve on Long Avenue, because it doesn't run as smoothly as the others do, for the driver has only one arm, but as it comes wiggling up the street, my heart seems to come right up into my mouth, for in it comes the most lovable man in the world. He is my  my husband. We met each other in the twilight, we were married between the dusk and dark he enlisted in the great World War, between the dusk and dark, was wounded in action just as day was kissing the world goodbye. He came home bruised in body and broken in spirit, and for months it seemed as if nothing could save him. It was then that I began to work at this store, and, coming home one evening in the dusk, I found him waiting for me with a smile. So you see," she fin- 'shed softly, "what the home-coming hour means to me." "I see," I answered huskily, "and henceforth and forever the twilight hour will have a new meaning for me the home-coming hour the hour when troubles are laid aside in the joy of coming pack to those we love." A Floral Symphony Betti Williamson on a winter-darkened world like a miracle. Children's footsteps echo in glad rhythm along the sidewalk, and the "swish-swish" of the housewife's broom, sweeping the path, is a sound that comes to the eager ear with pure delight. Even the sound of the rake, gathering last fall's leaves from the driveway, is a note closely tuned to joy. The welcome sunlight   slants across the garden wall and turns the brown grass to verdant green. Almost beneath the gardener's watchful eye, the crocus unfurls its bright aureole of satin petals, and the tulip bud expands into a colored cup of waxen beauty. Regal as a queen, wearing the royal purple, the hyacinth reigns is first spring day breaks upon the court of springtime flowers. And yet the busy housewife, the hurried mother, may not find time to truly enjoy the most exquisite season, to breathe in the fragrance of flowers that fade all too fast. For this reason, many homemakers bring some of the springtime flowers into the house.. Pansies and violets, dug up in small clumps, with the roots protected by soil, may easily be transferred to a yellow bowl to grace the comer table or to adorn the top of the bookcase. Tulips, hyacinths, and daffodils, when the buds are ready to open, may be dug up and placed in flower pots for indoor blooming. A single blossom or a simple flower arrangement will delight the A FLORAL SYMPHONY family and bring to the housewife that abiding sense of beauty so necessary to the spirit of the home.

Fletcher THE occasional angry chord that T crashed out from the piano under the touch of Elaine Norris' fragile-looking, but very strong, pale hands betrayed the indignant climax to which her thoughts kept building. The emotional turmoil thus expressed had been started on its incendiary way by her husband's suggestion the previous evening after dinner, as they were enjoying a game of dominoes in their comfortable living-room, that they join a group which was planning to rent land and produce a four-acre vegetable garden. For a moment Elaine had been stunned by the proposition. Then: "But, John," she had almost wailed, "my music my Hands!" Elaine had always thought of her hands with a capital "H." John had smiled just a little, she remembered, as he had paused briefly to place the domino which had scored him a "twenty." "But it won't be as bad as all of that," he had assured her soothingly. "There will be a dozen families tending the garden, and so we shall each need to spend only a few hours two or three evenings a week to keep it in a first-class condition. I think it will be good for us to work in the soil." "I'm sure I'm in very good physical condition," Elaine had retorted haughtily. "I do my exercises every day." "But I'm sure you'll find a few unused muscles if you get to tending a garden," John had smiled in return. "But my USO work," Elaine had further protested, "and the Civic Opera! And do you forget that I am doing almost all of the work in keeping up this big house? As for you  don't you get enough contact with Mother Earth in caring for our grounds?" "With Tommy Wells mowing the grass, I don't have too much to do. A couple of hours in the morning will give me time to keep things in good condition. And you will not have to give up your weekly evening at the USO. I wouldn't want you to be unable to play for the Service Men's Broadcast. As for the opera the work in the garden at that time will not be so heavy that you'll be prevented from assisting with its presentation. Everyone, now, should raise a garden." "But you and I can afford to buy what we need." "Of course if there is food to be had. But I look at it this way, with Mary and Beth both moving so frequently from place to place in order to be with their husbands, they aren't going to be able to do any canning, and I'm sure Robert will be much better fed in the army, if we help to increase the food supply for ourselves here at home." Elaine's eyes had softened then, as they again softened now, and nostalgic notes throbbed from the piano. Her three children had departed almost simultaneously from the home nest, leaving the big house very empty. Though she had left much of their care to others, Elaine Page 269 270 had loved her children dearly, even if her accustomed aloofness toward everything except her music had prevented her demonstrating that affection. Under this softening spell, she had agreed rather vaguely that perhaps they had better join the garden group, and she and John had turned to the discussion of other things. THIS morning, however, alone at her piano for her usual several hours of practice, her resentment flared anew. John knew how carefully she must guard her hands, those members which had been given such painstaking care for as long, almost, as she could remember. "Your hands are just like Grandmother Elaine's,' her mother had told her, as she was growing through the period of small girlhood. "If we take care of them, you may some day become the great concert pianist which she gave promise of being." And John knows, too, that I don't care for intimate association with people that most of them bore me, Elaine told herself. This dwelling apart had begun early for Elaine, for while still very young, she had given proof that she had inherited, at least in some measure, her grandmother's gift. Her whole family had been trained by her mother to cherish her "Hands," though not without some grumbling on the part of her two sisters when they had to wash the dishes, scrub the floors, do the laundry, and perform numerous other tasks that the mother had thought would coarsen and stiffen Elaine's cherished fingers. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE APRIL 1946 To do Elaine justice, she had spent long hours practicing and had really become the outstanding musician in the small town where her family lived. Later, due to her mother's indomitable determination, the family's limited resources had been taxed to send her to Salt Lake City for further study. There, she had developed adequately, if not brilliantly. But before many more years had passed, various auditions had proved to her that she lacked the spark of greatness. Rather than admit this, however, she had married John Nomis, a young architect who was fast becoming well established in Denver. This marriage had given her the excuse for not attempting a concert career. They had been able to afford a maid almost from the first days of their life together, and later, a cook and a gardener. John had encouraged her to keep up her music, feeling, as Elaine had agreed, properly contrite that he had accepted so great a sacrifice at her hands. She had soon established herself in the musical circles of Denver, where her services were soon much in demand in connection with various civic enterprises. So meticulously had she devoted herself to her piano ever since that, even now, when she was well over forty, she was still considered one of the city's leading pianists. She was vaguely conscious at times of late, however, that there were better musicians who could take her place and she had to stifle a desire to let down a little she did have to practice very hard to keep up and give these younger ones a chance. EMULATING GRANDMOTHER UT habit was stronger than the voice of this inner desire. That was why it had dismayed her so much to lose her maids to more desirable employment, Now, she was able to get a woman only twice a week, and that at an exorbitant wage, grateful that she owned so many labor-saving devices and that the place Was in perfect repair, Otherwise, she was sure she could not have managed to keep it up, Something an impelling force within her had told her what she must do. Now, in addition to all of this, she had promised John, that she would assist in do8ing even more unaccustomed tasks. Of what had she been thinking. But, perhaps there be much work for her to do at the garden, after all. Toom and ended in 4 circling landing that gave access to the several Tooms on the second floor. Made from an old tintype and exhibited it proudly, although she laid much more stress on her ancestor's on her Pioneering achievements. Elaine's mind worked that way. Ere was the same oval face, with its wide-set haz. El eyes; the same golden-brown hair, "Grandmother," she told the portrait softly, "I know that if you could give me advice, you would tell me to cherish my ability to play well above was denied you. Well, don't worry, dear, wherever you are. I won't let you down. I�ll keep our music where it should be first and fore. Most. You had to give up your life of culture. I don't have to forsake Grandmother smiled serenely 272 down upon her. Grandmother did not look like a frustrated woman, Elaine thought, uncertainly. Her first few times at the garden bore out Elaine's belief that it would make but few claims upon her. A man who had the implements came to plow and harrow, and she and John drove out to survey the work he had done. Elaine found herself unwillingly aware of the sweetness of the early spring evening. It seemed to her the materialized spirit of great music. As the evening advanced a little, and moonlight whitened the earth, she felt that the silvery cadences of The Moonlight Sonata had become visible beauty. It was not until several weeks later that Elaine began to realize how demanding the garden was to be. John came in one evening to tell her that all of the women who could go would be needed the following evening to help in their first big planting of beans. "Well, I can wear gloves," Elaine promised herself. But the beans were hard to control with gloved hands; too many rolled out at a time. Finally, she removed the gloves and really got interested in placing her beans into the rows as fast as the other women could drop theirs. After a very short time, however, her muscles began to protest. So she was in condition, was she? She remembered her boast to John, and pride made her work doggedly on. Soon she got her "second wind" and was able to finish triumphantly. When John inquired rather anxiously as they were driving home how she felt, she answered that she was fine. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE APRIL 1946 "Not so much out of condition as you would have me believe," she laughed gaily. "Well then," he told her, "you'll be available for the corn planting tomorrow night." THUS it was that Elaine found herself planting corn the following evening. This wasn't as hard as the bean planting had been. She found she could stand upright and toss the kernels exactly where they should go. She helped plant corn again the next evening. However, when John made ready to go to the garden for the fourth consecutive time, Elaine protested. "But you said we'd have to spend only two or three evenings a week there," she reminded him. "So I did," agreed John. "However, the corn must be planted. We should have had it done if we had had a large enough turnout the other evenings, but we didn't, so those of us who will come out will have to complete the job. Of course, you don't need to go unless you want to." But Elaine found she had something within her that wouldn't allow her to be a quitter. She was rather chagrined the next day to find that she was too sleepy to practice effectively. She decided that she had better take a short nap. On her way up to her room, she paused before Grandmother's picture. The eyes above her seemed to twinkle. "I suppose that's why you went on, too," Elaine thought. "When there was a job to be done, you couldn't quit, either." Now, as weeds began to make their appearance, the garden became more and more demanding. Elaine hoed EMULATING GRANDMOTHER without regard for her hitherto carefully tended hands. Blisters and then callouses appeared, but she could not stop. The hoe could not remove the weeds from between the plants, therefore Elaine took off her gloves that she might carefully pull these by hand. Would they ever be able to catch up with the intruders! It seemed not, for there was never more than half of the garden group present to work. "If everyone would come out and help, we could keep this garden looking as it should," she wailed to John. Because the work was so pressing, Elaine found herself reluctant to take time off for the USO. She wasn't really needed there. 'There were others, younger women, who could do the job as well as she could, and she knew that the soldiers, for all their appreciation, preferred that the girls play for their song fests. Therefore, after a few weeks, Elaine automatically put on her slacks and went to the garden each evening. It was payment enough to see those tows of vegetables become clean and sturdy. "Well, Grandmother," she told her ancestor's portrait, as the protests within her subsided and were being replaced by patient contentment with her exacting work, "I'm getting to know you better, You found joy in doing a worthwhile job tight and were willing to take the consequences, just as I am." Soon the canning season arrived, and the days became crowded from dawn to late at night. To Elaine, it seemed that a new woman was emerging from the aloof, cool chrysalis of her former self, which had dwelt apart as the rather mechanical interpreter of music. The 273 piano was now much neglected; certainly the masters were, for Elaine found that when she sat down to the instrument, new melodies clamored for expression. Her fingers wandered over the keys, striving to give these life. HERE was something of the garden in these melodies and even something of the community canning kitchen and the people who worked there with her. The melodies also held the deep contentment which she felt at the end of each work-filled day. And now she found herself set. Ting down notes: a Piano concerto was being born. She had never dreamed that she might compose! In the concerto she traced wonderingly her contact with reality  with truth. Here, was the mauve of evening, the flame of sunset, the satisfaction of toil, the rhythm of growing things, and the expanding of a soul. Here, also, was the fruition of the harvest the jade, ruby, and gold treasures of the storehouse. Elaine played her composition exultantly. Interpreting the music of others was a delight, but in creating something of truth and beauty herself, her most marvelous experience had come to her. "So that was your secret, Grandmother," she told the portrait after her awakening. "You knew the supreme joy of creating, and your whole life, consequently, made music, 'Tm glad I'm truly like the real. You, now, Grandmother. I am not merely 'Hands,' but mind and heart as well." The inner Elaine has been set free. OFFERINGS Etta S. Robbins Thanks from our hearts we give For blessings small and great, For homes and ties that bind In this estate.

Bowen's hand was gentle on her arm, though his voice was firm. "It could be much worse, you know, Rowena. It's a clean scar; no infection, and it's on the side of your face." Rowena Marshall sat stiff and upright in her chair. Her left hand was moving on her face, following the ridge from the left temple down to her neck. "It isn't fair to have such a scar, just from tripping over a rug. If only that vase hadn't been there. I was always going to get rid of that big ugly thing." "That's the way it is, sometimes," the doctor said. "You musn't worry too much. You know, Rowena, most women would consider themselves lucky to be as good looking as you are, right now, scar included. Well there's nothing more I can do for you. I'll be on my way." "You you really think a plastic surgeon could take this away?" The doctor closed his bag with a snap. "Absolutely. But it takes a lot of money these days if you can find a good man who isn't busy patching up the wounded soldiers. Goodbye, Rowena." "Goodbye, Dr. Bowen," she answered dully and allowed him to let himself out of the apartment. When the door closed behind him, Rowena buried her face in her hands. Tears ran through her fingers. Then, as if on puppet strings, she jerkily took her handkerchief from her pocket and dabbed at her eyes. She arose woodenly from her chair and walked to the large oval mirror that hung on the west wall of the pleasantly furnished living room. Her glossy black hair had not begun to whiten. Her large, deep, violet-blue eyes were as flashing as ever, with brows like blackbirds' wings. Long thick lashes threw shadows on her cheeks. Rowena turned her head, first one side to the mirror and then the other. If people could see only the right side of her face, they would not see the scar. But, on the left side, they would see the thin, but rough and jagged line that stood out in contrast against the fine whiteness of her skin, the lovely ears, the classic outline of her jaw. Without the scar, she was lovely. People on the street always turned to watch her. Now they would tum to stare at the scar! Don would have felt sorry for her, but he would have had more sympathy for himself. She could almost see his handsome face with its golden curls, a huge, blond viking of a man with all the charm and arrogance of a young god, laughing over her shoulder. He loved perfection in everything. "You are beautiful, gorgeous! We belong together. Two perfect specimens," he had always said. When he was in the right mood he was the most thrilling man Rowena had ever known. But he was too mercurial to remain in one temperament for long, and the sudden changes Page 275  276 were extremely trying to her emotions. He would be just as dramatic in his penitence as in his anger. THEN, it seemed to Rowena, that Don's personality faded from the mirror, and Basil came into view. Basil, with his kind heart and his patched-up face that showed the patches only when he smiled. Dear Basil. He understood how she felt about her scar. He would never be chagrined because she was not a perfect specimen now. She was glad that it was Basil who was alive instead of Don, though she had loved Don more than anyone in the world. But she couldn't have borne Don's growing indifference because she wore a flaw. Rowena turned away from the mirror and began pacing the room. There was thankfulness in her heart that she was married to Basil now. He would do anything she asked, no matter what the personal sacrifice might be, to make her happy. He knew what her beauty meant. And she was glad that she had been beautiful, for she felt that such loveliness had procured for her everything she had felt worth having in life. Rowena could remember the first time Don had brought Basil home with him. She and Don had just returned to town from their honeymoon. Basil hadn't known Don was married. Don had insisted that his old friend come home with him to dinner and to meet his lovely bride. Rowena had been shocked almost beyond good manners when she saw the left side of Basil's face when he smiled. It hadn't been noticeable when his features were in repose. All that evening she had managed to RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE APRIL 1946 keep her eyes away from the disfigurement. She noticed that Basil always tried to have this unmarred side toward her. When Basil had gone she had asked Don about the scar. "If you must know the truth, my precious, that is the man who saved my life. I might have been the one with the false jaw and the grafted skin. I never could have stood it. I�d have committed suicide. Thank goodness, it's only noticeable on him when he smiles." "Poor thing. He's the kind of a man who has a smiling disposition, too. He rescued you and paid that price? Oh, Don, you owe him such a debt." Don had fidgeted impatiently. "Yes, my dear. He was a hero. He is my best friend. But I hadn't seen him in fifteen years. He was in the hospital and went through so many operations. He sort of kept to himself." "T like him, Don. He is sweet and kind. And very lonely." "Good! We'll be the Three Musketeers." They had been. 'Three good friends until the day Don died; both Rowena and Basil balance wheels for the effervescent Don. Don had been a petulant and exacting patient. He left Rowena with two little boys and no money. His illness had taken everything, and the life insurance went to pay accumulated bills. Rowena stopped her pacing by the living room windows to look out and see the cold bleakness outside. It was on just such a day that Basil had asked her to marry him. It had surprised her. It had never occurred to her that he would have the temerity to think that she would marry him. THE SCAR It presented a way out of her difficulties. Basil would be a good father to the children, and he loved her. She knew that if she hadn't been beautiful he would not have asked her to marry him. He didn't expect too much of her. He had said, "I know it couldn't be like it was with Don; but we aren't youngsters now. I want to take care of you and the boys." He had taken care of them. Her life with Basil had become sweet, peaceful, gracious. She had never known such a quiet happiness. The boys were grown now, and in college trying to complete their studies before being called into the army. Basil had been successful in business, though now things were becoming a bit difficult. He gave her everything she wanted. His sympathy over her accident had given her the courage to face things. He said very little; it hadn't been necessary. It was all there in his gentle eyes. He would think of some way that would enable them to get the money for a plastic operation. She would have to ask him more about it when he came home. The sound of a key in the latch caused Rowena to turn from the window. "Anybody home?" called Basil from the front hall. She hurriedly replaced her handkerchief, and pushed back her hair. "In the living room," she said. Basil came in, his cheeks red with the cold. He looked happy. "You're home early." He took her hands. News. Want to hear it?" "Of course." ""Let's sit down." He led her to the sofa, and sat down, as he always did, automatically 277 so she could see the right side of his face. Only now, he could see the left side of her face. "I've managed to get some money to have that scar taken away. Dr. Condon, the best in the world, is here at the Veteran's Hospital doing some special work. He'll do it." She sat quite still. "Basil, it would take an awful lot of money." "I have five thousand dollars." Her eyes filled with tears. "Oh, Basil, you are wonderful!" "I�ll want my wife to be happy," he said softly. "I I suppose men take things differently. Your face I I suppose you have become so accustomed to it that you forget you have the scar." He did not speak for a moment. Then he shrugged his shoulders. "My face doesn't matter. I've never been beautiful." ROWENA sat stunned. In a flash she knew what she had never been sensitive enough to realize before. Basil had never become accustomed to his disfigurement. He had gone through his first realizations of things just as she had done. He might not have been beautiful, but that was not the point. Feeling the pity of his friends and family as they tried to appear casual about his scar must have been torture. But Basil's scar had taught him tolerance, understanding, and kindness. Her scar had taught her nothing but self-pity. Basil's deep, quiet philosophy of life, she realized, had been the background of her happiness. Her life with Basil, from her point of view, had been based on a compassionate tolerance of his affection, like that of a beauty for one who worships at her shrine. 278 Basil had been a much better father to her sons than Don would have been. They had called him Uncle Basil at first, but it soon became shortened to Basil. Then, no one knew exactly when, he had become "Dad." Rowena knew she had been a good wife. She had never given herself to him unreservedly; but he hadn't expected her to. He had said so. He had been happy to bask in the warmth of her lovely graciousness, a family man with a hearth to warm his toes and the children's laughter to warm his heart. It came to her now, in this moment of self-revelation, that she had never tried to understand his real feelings. His one thought, and hers, had been for her happiness. She knew now what she wanted to do. Basil put his hand in hers as it rested on the cushion of the sofa. "Aren't you happy?" She curled her fingers inside of his but did not look at him. "S-suppose I didn't want the operation?" she said softly. His hand convulsed quickly over hers. "It's all right. I have the money. We won't go into debt. I RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE APRIL 1946 know, you see, how it feels to be marred. You're so lovely, I couldn't bear to see you so hurt." "T'm not so lovely with the scar, I know. But I think I'll keep it. To keep me humble. It may grow fainter after awhile. Unless unless you feel that it spoils my appearance too much. I know most men marry first with their eyes." He released her hand and stood, facing her. "Your scar doesn't matter to me. Did you think I married you because you were beautiful? Haven't you realized what a contrast we make? I loved you for your gallant spirit with Don, your kindness to me. And, I knew Don's nature much better than you. You you and the boys have given me the most wonderful years a man ever had. These are the things that count. Beautiful faces grow just as old and wrinkled as the plain ones." Rowena arose to face him, her eyes level with his. Her arms went around his neck. As he began to understand her, a flush of happiness spread over his face. His eyes were illumined by what he saw in her eyes. She kissed him. On the left side of his face. SPRING Beatrice K.

MESSAGES FROM THE MISSIONS (Continued) New England Mission, Concord Branch (New Hampshire) FROM the New England Mission where Sister Bertha S. Reeder is President of the Relief Society, the following communication has been received from the Concord Branch through Sister Donna S. Fletcher, President: "I understand that with the establishment of this Relief Society, that now we have a Relief Society in every state in the Union. Even though New Hampshire was the last state to have a Relief Society, I feel that our little group has made great progress in its year of organization. "We hold meetings every Tuesday. Every member except myself is a convert to the Church. Sometimes our members are few, as the NEW ENGLAND MISSION, CONCORD (NEW HAMPSHIRE) BRANCH RELIEF SOCIETY Left to right: Violet and Edna Jessman, Lela Hammond, Stella Jessman; Jennie Anderson, First Counselor; Donna S.

Page 279 heavy snowstorms and distance of travel make it impossible for everyone to attend regularly. "Last year we made a quilt and sent it, along with many bundles of clothing, to the New England mission home. My husband and I, as natives of Utah, are greatly enjoying our work in the Church in Concord. We feel it a privilege to be able to have so many wonderful people with whom to associate. May God bless The Relief Society Magazine for the fine service it renders." Southern States Mission EFFIE MEEKS, Relief society President, Southern States Mission, writes under date of October 20, 1945: "We are happy to get back to work after such an inspiring conference. I feel now as if I might be able to do double duty, and in fact, we have had it to do since we came back. Work really piles up when one is away for awhile. "Enclosed is the picture of the pillowcases which I promised to send you. These were all made from feed sacks and the women drew their own designs. They were made by the Sylacauga Branch in Alabama. In order to bleach the lettering from the sacks they are soaked in bleaching solutions, 'following directions on the package. "The Georgia District started a cookbook several years ago by gathering favorite recipes from people in their district and also from all mission president's wives that have been in the South. The book has never been completed and now I have an idea that I would like to suggest to them, that we encourage RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE APRIL 1946 all the women of the Mission to contribute their favorite recipes and make it a real Southern State's cookbook." Danish Mission THE following excerpts from a letter written to Second Counselor Gertrude R. Garff from Sister Eva Gregersen of the Danish Mission will prove of interest to Relief Society members everywhere: "President Benson and two other American elders here were supposed to arrive tomorrow, Saturday, and stay over Sunday. Suddenly my husband came running home and told me that they had arrived unexpectedly and that President West was not at home until later, so we had better go down to the mission home and help entertain them until President West came. "Oh, what a lovely time we had! The new apostle seems to be a very wonderful man. I was just thrilled to sit and listen to him. It was just like the good old days to have Americans around again. I am sure we will have some wonderful meetings on Sunday. "We have had many people out to the meetings lately. One of the reasons, I am sure, is that we have received these wonderful gifts from you, our dear friends of the United States. We have all received something. Especially am I happy for the wonderful blanket and the good quilt. Every member has received some kind of blanket or quilt, and I can tell you that it is badly needed. Ole [her son] got a nice pair of pants. It is his only pair. To say that we are thankful is putting it mildly, overwhelmed is the better word."

Photograph submitted by Effie Meeks, President Southern States Mission Relief Society. 282 Samoan Mission j= OQ. ADAMS, President of the Samoan Mission, reports an interesting activity in the islands: "Annually, in Samoa, the Relief Society goes over the mission with a fine-tooth comb inspecting, scrutinizing, pondering, suggesting, commending, condemning, judging, and even fining! It is a procedure effected in the spirit of kindness and the genuine desire to help raise the standards of the family, and hence of the Church as well. May we briefly follow such a group? "Relief Society officers and members of all ages are arranged in groups convenient in size and in proximity to the field to be inspected. The date is fixed so that each district knows when to expect the going over. "I saw one group in very efficient jovial operation at Pesega Mission headquarters. How the dozen keen eyed sisters, all faultlessly gowned, chuckled when one of them hoisted an office chair on our desk and found dust on its underside! They went over our spacious domicile from cellar to garret then ended up with the proverbial singing and dancing that make Samoa what it is a land of music, rhythm, and joy. "Where I have observed the plan in operation, it produces good results. Each family gets out all its dishes, utensils, bedding, mats, pillows, sheets, blankets, clothing, etc. All are expected to be clean, mended, and usable. First, the visiting party all bathe and change into clean clothes, and have the customary greetings of speeches, etc. It is the custom to give the people being visited crackers and cocoa. Then, the work is begun. A scrutinizing peep RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE APRIL 1946  or more than a peep is taken of the house and its contents and surroundings. If all is up to requirements, all well and good, the family receives commendation. If not, kindly and constructive criticism and suggestions are made, and the family may even be fined a few shillings, which goes into the Relief Society fund. "A house of a certain size requires a certain number of coarse floor mats, with better ones covering them, as the pebble floor would soon ruin the finer top ones. The same applies to fine beautiful bed mats. The woven shutters, which are always raised high unless it is raining hard, are part of the requirements. Pillows are filled with the native 'tree' cotton. Many families have mattresses made of this cotton and it serves well. The sisters also work beautiful designs on pillowcases in colored thread, also, on bedspreads, doilies, etc. There must be enough of everything to make the home comfortable for all its occupants enough mosquito nets, for instance. If the house leaks, renovation is pointed out as a pressing need. If the ground about the house is littered or weedy (and it seldom is in Samoa), pressure is brought to bear to have it cleaned. If cooking utensils and dishes are insufficient, getting some cheap ones is recommended. In no case are hardships imposed upon anyone, for almost any native can cut, dry, and sell enough coconuts to buy these necessities and comforts. "So these middle-aged and older Relief Society sisters of Samoa, with their unique, consistent and_ thorough system of encouraging their members to maintain model homes and surroundings, are pioneers in NOTES FROM THE FIELD 283 what might well be followed else what might well be followed elsewhere. Many a home in the U.S.A. would not pass inspection in Samoa!" Northwestern States Mission Coos Bay (Oregon) Branch MARTHA HUNT, President of Coos Bay Branch (Oregon) Relief Society, describes an unusually successful food sale and bazaar: 'In the southwestern corner of Oregon, on Coos Bay, nine Relief Society sisters have just held their annual bazaar and cooked food sale. These women put in long hours of work to make it a success and saved their sugar throughout the year, bit by bit, so as to make cakes, cookies and candies. Some of the members donated sugar and others took the time to prepare cakes, etc. Materials were scarce here this year, as everywhere, and a strike was in progress, but the fancy work and foodstuffs 'came forth' when bazaar time rolled around. "The receipts this year were around $160, of which $100 was given toward a building fund for a chapel in this branch. Plates and bowls were also purchased for use at annual dinners and Sunday School parties. "Our women have a motto: 'There is no task too big for the Coos Bay Relief Society.'

TANNER, President of the Juneau (Alaska) Branch Relief Society, describes a sacrament meeting program and other interesting activities: "March 4th (1945) the branch presidency gave the time in sacrament meeting allotted to speakers to the Relief Society. We carried out the program suggested in the Bulletin as closely as possible for our small group. The dialogue, all the talks, and: most of the musical selections were given. We enjoyed preparing and carrying out this program which was acclaimed as very interesting by the audience. "For further commemoration, on March 8th, our business and social evening, we prepared a special luncheon for our group and spent the evening sewing and relating reasons for our interest in Relief Society and the great need we have for the association and the uplift and knowledge we receive from the activities."

Page 286 Let's Make Dickies GPRING is here in all its glory. How about a "Dickie Day" for the Work-Meeting Tuesday? A change of dickies gives an old suit a teal rejuvenation. Where shall we get the material? Dickies require comparatively small pieces of material and they are easily cut. The only shaping necessary is at the neck, back and front, and a slight slope to the shoulder. Let's look in the scrap bag. Here is a piece of lawn. A twenty-inch length by a_ twelve-inch width will make a plain front. A strip one-inch wide, when finished down the front with narrow rickrack, and a bow at the neck to match, makes an interesting finishing. If there is enough material, the back of the dickie may be cut of the same material as the front. If not, a bleached sugar sack will do as well. Make an opening in the center back seven or eight inches long. 'This same style works nicely with plain or corded rayon and rayon rickrack. Tape is placed about one inch from the bottom and tied on each side to hold the dickie firm. Now, find a piece of georgette about seventeen inches wide and twenty inches long, plus some scraps for a bow, and we shall soon have another dickie. This one will be pintucked in groups of threes, three C4 = groups on each side of the front. Shape the neck, then make a net back which has an eight or nine inch opening down the center back, and bind the neck with a bias piece of the georgette. At the center front, place a bow made of a double piece of georgette. Pin tucks, lace, and insertion will work together effectively in a dickie of either lawn or batiste. A frilly jabot may be added; or the dickie may be left with a plain neck. A discarded organdy evening dress may be used to advantage in making sheer dickies. The tail of a man's shirt makes a neat, easily laundered dickie. These, and many otherwise unused materials, may be used advantageously in a "Dickie Day Project."
