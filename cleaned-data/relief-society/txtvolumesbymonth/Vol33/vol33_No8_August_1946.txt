THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE AND WHAT OF TIME Mabel Jones Gabbott And what of time? Is it a stream That flows in season's cycles through Life's valley? Is it running sand That turns life's hourglass for you? Can it be measured by the spring, The summer, the ensuing fall, Or charted into days and months To robin's chirp and wild geese call? Of time there is no measuring, For it is boundless. All the days Of yesteryear are voiced this dawn In our weak, fumbling, groping wavs; And all tomorrow's promise; all Its dreams are inextricably Linked with the doings of this hour To fashion our eternity. The Cover: "Mirror Lake in the High Uintahs." From a photograph by Grace O. Tuttle VOL. 33, NO. 8 AUGUST 1946 Photograph by Grace O. Tuttle "SYMPHONY IN BLUE AND WHITE" White Daisies and Turquoise Blue Delphiniums The Importance of Thrift Elder Alma Sonne Assistant to the Council of the Twelve Apostles HE Church, functioning and operating through its members, is the most effective character building agency in the world. It has always stood for night living and constructive thinking in all the phases of human life. It stands for intellectual, moral, and _ spiritual progress. Its aim is to strengthen the security, the happiness, and the independence of every home, and to protect the family against fallacious doctrines, subversive tendencies, and destructive forces that now threaten the stability of organized society. The family is the unit of everyday life. It is the moral, spiritual, and economic unit. Every stimulation and encouragement should be given to upbuild and protect the family and the home. Twenty-five hundred years ago the Greek, Socrates, told his students they would be happier if they would study the problems of the home and such fundamental things as thrift, industry, and the wise management of the family income. Surely, a measure of financial independence is as precious and important to men and women as political independence. It is worth all the striving and sacrifice necessary for its achievement. Much of the unhappiness in the world is due to poor economics, selfish pleasures, and thoughtless indulgences. An easy, carefree life, without purpose and plan, will undermine character and weaken the moral fiber of men and women. It has been said that Charles Dickens regarded the parable of the prodigal son as the most beautiful story in all literature. It is not difficult to picture the wayward son re. Turning to his home, disillusioned and thoroughly repentant. He had "wasted his substance with riotous living." Worse still, he had wasted his life and dissipated his powers. Therein lay the tragedy of a spendthrift's life. Haphazard use of time, money, and energy means a poor return and is devoid of satisfaction. Devotion to a purposeful plan calls for strength and determination, and lays the foundation for a well-ordered, independent life. A thrifty person looks ahead; he practices self control and prepares for emergencies that may arise. He faces life with a positive, self-reliant attitude and seeks to fit himself for an opportunity when it comes. Abraham Lincoln's life began in a wretched home amid poverty and discouragements. By sheer determination and a resolute spirit, he overcame, what appeared to be, an insurmountable handicap. He was motivated always by a strong desire to go forward and to improve his condition. All through his life he exemplified the principles of thrift and hard work, preparing carefully and thoughtfully for future responsibilities. In doing so, he gained Page 507 508 strength and wisdom, and thus fortified himself to withstand the forces which were conspiring against him. Nowhere is thrift more important than in the home. Nowhere are the consequences of extravagance and waste more destructive of human happiness. Ordinarily, the proper management of a home is a full-time job. It calls for wisdom, determination, and __ perseverance. The mother who neglects the home to augment the family income or to engage in futile amusements and social pastimes, frequently does so at a great cost and a sacrifice of family solidarity. It is estimated that seventy- -five per cent of the family income is spent either directly or indirectly by the housewife. This expenditure covers items which are essential to the happiness and well-being of the entire family. Any plan that will be helpful in solving the domestic problem of income and outgo is worthy of careful thinking and thorough consideration. To devise and to put into successful operation such a plan offers a challenge to the wisest and most businesslike household. The prudent and conscientious homemaker will welcome any suggestion that will strengthen the family economics. A budget is a financial plan by which the spending and investment of money is controlled. Its purpose is to avoid loose, thoughtless, and wasteful methods. It deals with such items as food, clothing, shelter, doctor bills, amusement, charity, insurance, savings, contributions, and many others that come up for consideration in a family. Adherence RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE AUGUST 1946 to a budget probably means a greater effort, a more frugal fare, and a severe discipline; but it also means a sense of security and worthiness, a conservation of resources, and a step towards a prosperous and productive life, and, certainly, a step away from vice, luxury, and ostentation. Calvin Coolidge, who had a reputation for frugality and thrift, speaking to a gathering of newspapermen, made the following statement: Extravagance lengthens the hours and diminishes the rewards of labor. I favor the policy of economy, not because I wish to save money, but because I wish to save people. Every dollar that we carelessly waste means that their life will be so much the more meager. Every dollar that we prudently save means that their life will be so much the more abundant. Thrift, in its broadest sense, consists of the efficient and productive direction of one's energies. It enters into every field of honorable endeavor. The artist who paints a picture employs thrifty habits, for he builds upon something he has already achieved. The housewife who patiently and methodically adds comfort and attractiveness to the home practices thrift. So does the farmer who plants, cultivates, fertilizes, and increases the productivity of his fields. There is no progress without thrift. It is the cornerstone of our entire industrial life. The old-fashioned economic virtues are as sound today as they were when the pioneers laid the foundations of all we have and are. They are fundamentally and _ essentially progressive, and point the way to a better and a more satisfying life. THE IMPORTANCE OF THRIFT EXTRAVAGANCE is misdirected and wasted energy. It is the road that leads to poverty and disappointment. It undermines character and robs one of the power to proceed safely and constructively. It is a source of embarrassment and discomfiture, and frustrates all] plans and purposes for better living and a more comfortable existence. It comes from a craving for things to which people are not entitled until they have worked and saved to provide such enjoyment and possession. There is no grander spectacle in the world than that of a husband and wife girding their loins for the battle of life, all barriers crumbling before them. To them belong the fruits of honest labor and persistent effort.. Waste in any form is an enemy to the individual, the home, and the nation. Brigham Young said: Let nothing go to waste. Never consider that you have bread enough around you to suffer your children to waste a crust or a crumb of it. If a man is worth millions of bushels of wheat and corn, he is not wealthy enough to suffer his servant girl to sweep a single kernel of it into the fire. Remember it, do not waste anything, but take care of everything. Such was the economic philosophy of the great pioneer colonizer whose wisdom and leadership subdued deserts, built towns and cities, and established a thriving commonwealth. But, above all things, Brigham Young was anxious to preserve the stability of the home. Waste and extravagance have wrecked homes and brought despair and misery to many families, Too many young people, as they assume the responsibility of home- 509 making, insist on beginning married life with all the comforts and conveniences of their parental home. They fail to take into consideration the long struggle and the frugal habits which have made possible the establishment and maintenance of that home. Often the parents are too indulgent with children and permit them to set up standards and to form habits far beyond their power and ability to sustain. The excessive use of the family automobile has lured many a youth away from the path of industry and duty. Extravagant tastes in the matter of food, clothing, amusements, and such other demands as clever advertising  promotes, have been allowed to develop without regard for the welfare and security of home and family. Frequently, a selfish desire and an unworthy ambition to outflaunt neighbors and friends, regardless of the means at one's disposal, are back of many ill-advised and unnecessary expenditures. National thrift is a bulwark against chaos and disintegration. It begins in the homes of the people, for no nation can rise above the stability, the integrity, the sanctity, and the coherence of its family group. Whatever perils the family, perils the nation. The laws of progress and growth are eternal. The pioneers survived because they were thrifty and industrious. They developed the virtue to struggle and wait and to possess their souls in patience. They looked ahead and made provisions for the future. Sometimes their rations were short and their food very simple, but they battled on against want and misery, and finally (Continued on page 550) Cache Valley Part of the Mormon Epic Caroline Eyring Miner N interesting chapter in the story of the colonization of Mormondom is the settlement of Cache Valley. The pioneers were a nature-loving people, and, as such, they found a paradise in the beautiful Cache Valley of Northern Utah and Southern Idaho. Letters, journals, and histories reveal that here, indeed, is a veritable cache of early Mormon history. This great valley a giant finger of Lake Bonneville was the hunting ground for many tribes of Indians, most of them belonging to the Shoshone family, who fished in the clear streams and hunted in the wooded canyons. There is reason to believe that buffalo roamed the lower valley, and that, in the severe winter of 1785, they were killed off. During the period from 1824 to 1847, the valley was visited by trappers who searched the rivers and creeks for beaver. The valley was then called Willow Valley, but later it came to be known as Cache Valley because caches of furs and food were made here. During this period, such celebrated American scouts and naturalists as Jim Bridger, Lewis and Clark, and Charles Fremont, are among the white men who first visited this verdant valley. Captain Stansbury, of the corps of topographical engineers for the United States Army, investigating Cache Valley, in 1849, for the possible Page 510  location of an army post, thus described it:.. Covered with a profusion of rich green grass and adorned and diversified by numerous clumps of willows. Speckled trout of large size abounded in the streams. The streams on the east side take their rise in a heavy range running to the north and constituting the eastern limit of the valley which has an average width of about ten miles. The canyons they form before leaving the mountains abound in timber. They afford facilities for irrigation, presenting at the same time advantageous sites for the erection of mills. These ravines abound in timber in quantities sufficient for fuel and building purposes. Looking for more grazing land, President Brigham Young and other Church leaders established the Church ranch, or farm, in 1855-56, between the places where Wellsville and Logan were later settled. Seven men and two women spent the first hard winter there. These were the first women to reside in Cache Valley, and they showed the great fortitude and patience typical of all Mormon pioneer women under trying circumstances.   Sister William A. Warner and Sister Stolworthy fed the men, grinding the wheat in coffee mills and making it into gruel. When food ran out, Brother Dowdle set out on foot for more. He returned with one sack of flour. Sister Warner writes: Out of my share of flour  one half pound a day I saved one cupful a week and it came in handy when conditions became even worse. Sister Stolworthy's baby was the first to be born in Cache Valley. The first house in Cache Valley was also built at this ranch in August 1855. During this first winter there were three thousand head of cattle at the ranch, and of the two thousand owned by the Church only four hundred twenty survived the winter snow which was four and one half feet deep on the level and ten feet deep in the canyons. To mention the name of Peter Maughan is to recall the real beginning of Cache Valley settlement. In 1856, he was chosen by President Brigham Young to take a small colony into the valley, where he arrived September 15, 1856, with his wife and sons, W. H., and John M., also Zial Riggs, George Ryan, Francis Gennel, and O. D. Thompson, and families. They settled at what is now Wellsville, and, September 27, a child was born to Mrs. Peter Maughan. This child was considered to be the first child born in Cache Valley until the journal of Sister Warner came to light. The Maughan child was born in a covered wagon after the first snowfall. Because of Indian trouble and the difficulties occasioned by the entrance of Johnston's army into Utah, these colonists moved into Southern Utah, but returned in 185g. It is interesting to note that Sister Maughan mentions in her journal that her chairs had been scattered all over, but that otherwise they found things much as they had left them. After 1859, the permanent settlement of Cache Valley began in earnest. In June of that year, thirtyfive families moved to the vicinity of Logan and began its settlement. Some of the prominent people in this enterprise were Hezekiah Thatcher, financier; William B. Preston, first bishop; Ezra T. Benson, colonel of the "minute men," and first stake president; and Edward W. Smith, the first school teacher. Among the many interesting incidents connected with early Logan history, it is worth mentioning that on March 7, 1870, the third election was held, and 265 votes were cast, fifty by women. THE FIRST RELIEF SOCIETY HOUSE IN MENDON, CACHE VALLEY CACHE VALLEY PART OF THE MORMON EPIC 511 PETER MAUGHAN This is indicative of the important part women have played in Mormondom. The fact that Logan very early prohibited the sale of liquor is also evidence of the high type of citizenship there. APOSTLE WILFORD WOOD.- RUFF visited Logan, in 1863, with President Brigham Young, and, noticing the people lined up on either side of the street to welcome them, was inspired to prophesy that a temple would be built in Logan. President Young said the prophecy would be fulfilled. Its fulfillment was begun May 18, 1877, when President Young and his counselors came to Logan to break ground for RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE AUGUST 1946 the temple. The stately edifice was dedicated May 17, 1884, by President John Taylor. The $608,000 structure was a monument to the sacrifice and co-operation of the pioneers of this section who, during the same period, built the tabernacle, which still stands on the beautiful square in the heart of the city. Logan has always been an outstanding educational and recreational center, and, even in this brief article, we must mention the establishment of Brigham Young College in 1877, and the Utah State Agricultural College, in 1890. Both schools began inauspiciously but grew rapidly and have done much good in Cache Valley. In 1858, the colony of Mendon was founded, and it is interesting to read how, in 1874, Mendon reported that its people could not go into the United Order until their bishop, Henry Hughes, returned from his mission. Then apostle Snow very quickly and effectively asked the question if the kingdom of God had to stop in Mendon because Bishop Hughes was on a mission. This settled the matter, and the Order was at once established, one third of the people being in the Order and two-thirds out. The people who joined the Order put in all they had, and all were paid according to the days they worked, no matter what they had contributed. Richmond was established in 1859, with Brother Bair and others in charge. Also, in the same year, Smithfield was settled, with John G. Smith as the first bishop. The town was named in his honor. In 1860, Hyrum was settled, being named Hyrum because it was in CACHE VALLEY PART OF THE MORMON EPIC a direct line with a proposed settlement at the Church farm which was to have been named Joseph. This settlement did not materialize. Also, in this same year, Millville and Hyde Park were established. Clarkston was settled in 1864, and is the burial place of Martin Harris who died in 1875. In 1869, Newton was settled, and, in 1870, Lewiston was established. Severe frosts killed the grain in July for three successive years, and very much discouraged the settlers in Lewiston. However, they persisted and now have a rich, thriving community. Benson was begun in 1871, Trenton in 1872, and College Ward in 1879. Franklin, the most northerly of the Cache Valley settlements, was begun in the spring of 1860. It holds the distinction of being the first permanent settlement in Idaho, but, in the beginning, was considered to be in Utah territory. In 1865, Weston was established, the first settlement in Cache Valley on the west side of Bear River. In 1877, Preston was settled at the end of the Utah Northern railroad, and it soon became the leading town in northern Cache Valley. The settlement of Cache Valley was very rapid, especially during the year 1860. As this valley had been the hunting ground of various Indian tribes, they moved through the settlements as the seasons changed and caused a good deal of trouble. The saints tried to handle their problem in several ways. First, they tried to follow the advice of President Brigham Young by attempting to feed rather than to fight the Indians. At the same time they built their communities in the form 513 of forts for protection. Also, they maintained armed "minute men" under Colonel Ezra T. Benson. In spite of all these precautions, a few children were stolen, and some of the settlers lost their lives. One of the bloodiest engagements between the white men and the Indians took place at Battle Creek, near Franklin. Hundreds of Indians and many of General Connor's men were killed. The following account of one settlement was typical of all: During the first season they built for themselves homes (usually log with sod roofs and in fort formation), planted and harvested crops of grain and vegetables, constructed roads into the canyons so they could get what timber and firewood they needed, dug a small irrigation canal, and erected a log school and meeting house.

Only whole-hearted co-operation and hard work, fired by faith in Photograph by R. M. Brown RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE AUGUST 1946 God and in their leaders and their religion, made it possible to establish the colonies in Cache Valley, as well as in all other parts of Mormondom.

Pioneer Stories and Incidents THE INDIANS OF UTAH AND THE BLACK HAWK WAR President Amy Brown Lyman {This story is the second in a series of true pioneer incidents to be published by The Relief Society Magazine in honor of the 1947 Utah Centennial celebration.  Ed. AMONG the Indian tribes encountered by the pioneers in Utah and the adjoining areas were the Utes, the Piutes, and the Bannocks all belonging to the Shoshone family. It was the policy of the pioneers to treat these Indians justly and fairly and to try to teach them the arts of civilization. According to the advice of Brigham Young, they were to be fed rather than to be fought. He warned against taking advantage of them in trade or otherwise, or even giving them offense. While the Indians seemed at times to appreciate this friendly attitude, and while some of their chiefs proved to be faithful friends, still, on the whole, in those early days the Indians were suspicious of the white man and revengeful as well. As they saw their lands taken from them, their freedom to roam and camp at will curtailed, and as plans of the Government to segregate them on reservations developed, they were filled with consternation, and they naturally felt that the white men were their enemies. And, to an Indian, it was no sin to steal from an enemy, or even to take the life of an enemy. Misunderstandings, therefore constantly arose, and, because of repeated hostilities and aggressions, and the frequent and wanton _attacks on the white settlers, it was necessary for the latter not only to defend themselves, but in some instances to take the offensive. As a result, there were, for a number of years, skirmishes and even wars. The most serious of these conflicts was the Black Hawk War, so called because Chief Black Hawk was the leader of hostilities. It began in Sanpete County in 1865, and involved Sevier County as well, lasting about three years. It was a desperate struggle and the white settlers in these counties were in constant danger. One of the saddest incidents of this war was that connected with the Kuhre family of Ephraim. The writer was fortunate in hearing this story from the lips of William D. Kuhre himself, for many years the bishop of the Sandy Ward, where he is today greatly loved and respected. Brother and Sister Martin P. Kuhre, were converts to the Church from Denmark, and upon their arrival in Utah, in 1862, they settled in Ephraim, Sanpete County, where they, engaged in farming. On an October day in 1865, they went out to their field on the edge of town to harvest their potatoes. With them were their son William, age two years, Elizabeth Page 515 516 Peterson, a girl of seventeen, who lived with the family, and a young man named Sorn Sorenson. As they went about their work, they were suddenly startled and terrified to see approaching them a band of Indians led by Black Hawk himself. Young Sorenson, who had known Black Hawk intimately before the war, walked over to the chief to try to engage him in conversation and to avert trouble, if possible, until aid might come to them. Black Hawk, who had visited the Sorenson home as a young Indian, and had eaten at their table, seemed a little ill at ease as he stood there facing Sorenson. However, the Indians only a few yards away did not hesitate to make an attack, which resulted in the death of Brother and Sister Kuhre and the young girl, Elizabeth. Sorenson was permitted to escape with his team. After this, the Indians, with about RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE AUGUST 1946 two hundred head of cattle they had acquired, started off toward the canyon. Later in the day, a party of white men went into the Kuhre field expecting to find them all dead. Imagine their surprise when they found the little boy, William, alive. He had been in the arms of his father when the latter was shot, but was uninjured himself. Left alone, he had crept over to where his mother lay, and he was found with a tearstained face, lying upon her breast asleep, with his clothing saturated with her blood. Having no relatives in America, the child was adopted by John and Ellen Dobbie, who tenderly reared him to manhood. The Black Hawk War cost the lives of over seventy white people and the destruction of much property. SKULL VALLEY Beatrice K.

Moyle HE limelight of the world will I be upon Utah during the year 1947, when we hold our great Centennial celebration. We have all been looking forward eagerly to this date. We have promised ourselves that when it arrived we would have our homes in order, our cities and towns beautified, and our gardens and surroundings made attractive so that we could present ourselves serenely to the world and prove that we have truly made the desert blossom as the rose. The planting around the Latter-day Saint home should receive the critical attention of every homeowner. Brigham Young considered this work of beautification of the greatest importance, even for the earliest log cabins and pioneer farms of our first settlers. President Young's counsel upon this subject is applicable to all of us as we approach the Centennial: Beautify your gardens, your houses, your farms; beautify the city. This will make us happy, and produce plenty. The earth is a good earth, the elements are good if - we will use them for our own benefit, in truth and righteousness. Then let us be content, and go to with our nights to make ourselves healthy, wealthy, and beautiful. And, speaking directly to the women of the Church, this great leader explained his ideals of homemaking in simple and exact terms: It is your right, wives, to ask your husbands to set out beautiful shade and fruit trees, and to get you some vines and flow and if your have not time, get them yourselves and plant them out. Some, perhaps, will say, "Q, I have nothing but a log house, and it is not worth that." Yes, it is worth it. I and get yines to run over the door, so that everybody who passes will say, "What a lovely little cottage!" This is your privilege and I wish you to exercise yourselves in your own rights. These words should spur our modern homeowners into action to make every home lovely with  green lawns and flowers for the coming year. But how are we to accomplish any real planting results in the short time that now remains? One answer to this problem lies in making full, abundant use of the planting season immediately before us, from the middle of August into September and early October. We can start to plant soon after the first of August with excellent results. The days are still hot, but the nights are beginning to grow cooler, with more dewfall. 'The earth is warm and fertile and teeming with vitality. Roots take hold easily in the soil at this time if they are kept moist and are shaded from the sun. Lawn seed planted in early fall germinates quickly and grows rapidly, soon forming a rich carpet of green. The lawn will then have Page 517 518 the entire fall in which to grow, and it will be well established by the time winter arrives and will continue to develop under the snow. When spring comes, the grass will leap into active growth with the first warm day. Perennial plants that are set out in the cold, wet ground of spring take root slowly, and are delayed in their blossoming, but plants that are given the advantage of early fall planting can easily become husky clumps with a full show of bloom the following year. Remember that the success of any planting depends upon four things: thorough preparation of soil; early planting (the earlier the better); shading of the plant from the hot sun while it is taking root and getting ready to grow; and constant. And abundant supply of moisture during the entire fall. And, should freezing weather arrive before the first snowfall, it will be wise to apply a mulch of leaves around the plants to protect them from being heaved out of the ground. Bestir yourself, if you would bring sparkle and color into your garden to help make the Centennial year festive and beautiful. Add such desirables to your garden as the small, low, cushion-like spring perennials that can make the season a thing of beauty. The sweet blue forget-menots for the shady spots; the foamy white arabis to bring a lacy froth along the path; the brilliant and dazzling show put out by that splendid alyssum, basket-of-gold, as many call it; or the equally brilliant and rich-toned purple aubretia, the purple rock cress. Purchase small plants of any of RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE AUGUST 1946 these and give them correct and regular care, and they will nestle down and spread out and prepare to display all their charms next spring, as well as during all the springs to come. These perennials are permanent subjects, well worth the efforts of any home gardener. Among the taller spring bloomers are anchusa myosotifolia, the forget-me-not anchusa, an eighteen-inch, blue-flowered charmer; yellow doronicum, bearing large, pure yellow, daisy-like blooms in great abundance. Doronicum is a splendid shade lover and very useful on this account. Consider columbine, too, in delicate pastel colors, and fragrant sweet rocket, to make a misty lavender haze. With these, and plenty of gay tulips, which will be available this fall, any garden can help to turn next spring into a veritable flower festival. Choose the new kinds of iris for August planting. If these are given plenty of moisture, you will enjoy good iris bloom next season. There are wonderful new kinds of oriental poppies. Find a nurseryman, if you can, who sells the new pink-colored ones. The variety "Wonderkind" is perhaps the finest of all, but many others are of unusual beauty and, once planted, will bloom punctually each year. These flowers demand early planting. Delphinium does best when moved while in active growth. Delphinium often rots if it is set out when the ground is cold and wet. However, this plant is worth all the care it requires, for there is no lovelier decoration for the late June and July garden. Our greatest concern, at present, Se Courtesy Jackson and Perkins Company Newark, New York should be for the flowers that bloom during the July Covered Wagon Days of the Centennial year. This will be the month when visitors Irom far and near will flock to every part of our State. Let us prepare well for this event by giving full space to midsummer bloomers. PHLOX, "PROGRESS" Courtesy Jackson and Perkins Company, Newark New York DELPHINIUM HYBRID, "GAYETY" This delphinium has the all-out-at-once characteristic of bloom, and the spike re-mains in fine condition for considerable time after the top buds have opened. Al-though the side shoots do not crowd the main spike, they come into bloom and continue the period of bloom for several weeks more. The growth is bushy and the blossoming is repeated in the fall. The color is a pink lavender, with an outer row of blue petals, which is very attractive. HOLLYHOCKS display their frilly show during July. Let them stand guard at the gate or by the fence. Shasta daisies make a sea of glistening white. Plant them in generous clumps. Most important of all perennials is the tall midsummer phlox which does well in almost every garden in the intermountain country. Set out generous plantings of this magnificent flower to glorify your July Centennial garden. Nurserymen can supply you with many excellent kinds in a wide range of vivid colors, from pure white through lovely pinks into rosy shades: cherry, salmon, mauve, lavender, scarlet, and purple. You can make a garden of color and perfume worthy of a great occasion with this fine flower alone. Small clumps of phlox can be moved while in full bloom, if they are well watered before being dug, and if they are kept well soaked after moving.

Select yours this year if you can. Many of them can be found still blooming, for their flowering .. season is a long one. Phlox plants require a well-enriched soil and prefer a spot receiving a little afternoon shade. They also appreciate additional mulches of manure placed directly over the  stems in fall and before the flowering season. If the garden is hot and phlox will need additional mulching to keep the surface from drying out. Lawn clippings or peat moss are excellent for this purpose.

Such attentions bring good returns in large heads of flowers and rich, deep colorings. Utah can blaze with color next midsummer, with iris, phlox, delphiniums, and other hardy perennials. In addition, we can have the bloom of many colorful annuals that can be planted next spring.

GARDEN MAKING FOR CENTENNIAL DAYS GARDEN OF MRS. JOHN H. BENNETT The graceful, curving brick walk and the arrangement of the border in front of the tulip beds, lend an Old World charm to this lovely garden. Night Callers Gladys Dewey VERY crack in the long, one-room log cabin had been covered. From the outside not one tiny slit of light could be seen. Nancy Parker fitted her white shawl comfortably around her shoulders and settled herself in her bees wax polished oak rocker. John and Martha had been put to bed, and everything was in readiness. All she could do now was wait. Her deep blue eyes wandered over the long room that had been her home for almost three years, falling first on the much-used flour sack that stood upright in the shadows behind the door, bulging with essentials. In it were a pair of homespun trousers John had outgrown, a dress Martha had worn, some red and yellow beads, an old, but still usable, coat of her husband's, and on top lay a mound of sweet cookies. They were all the right gifts. Nancy had filled that same sack so many times that she knew just what it should contain. At a murmured sound from Martha, her eyes darted to the place where two curly-haired children lay cuddled in a deep feather mattress, lying on the spotlessly clean pineboard floor. A multicolored patchwork quilt was over them. Satisfied that the children were both asleep, Nancy leaned her head against the back of her chair and watched the light from the crackling pine log in the fireplace as it played along the dark, low ceiling. She was very thankful for the fire. The day had been cloudy and chilly, but she Page 522 had not dared to build a fire, for smoke could be seen or smelled even though the cabin was far below the Indian village high up in the mist covered mountains. Having smoke coming from the chimney, if the Indians had seen Jim Parker's wagon leave, would be inviting trouble, for they would know that Nancy was alone. Night had come early and settled with foggy darkness so thick it seemed you would be able to reach out and touch it. Knowing that smoke could not penetrate such an atmosphere, she had hurriedly lit the fire. Not being one to sit with folded hands, Nancy took her knitting from the basket on the table beside her and began another row on her husband's socks. Jim Parker had gone on his yearly journey to the county seat. Pine City was forty miles away and it took three days to make the trip one day to go, one to transact his business and buy supplies for the winter, and one day to return. This was the first time that Nancy had not been with him, but the distance was too long, and the weather too uncertain to take the children, Martha, six, and John, eight. % * * In preparing for the trip, Jim had hitched his big bays, Maud and Pat, to his covered wagon loaded with feed for the team and a roll of bedding for himself. Before leaving, he had glanced at his watch, then scanned the heavens. If the NIGHT CALLERS late October sky had not been covered with a solid mass of dingy gray clouds, the sun would have been just peeking over the rim of the mountain, to splash in through the small window onto the children's bed. But that morning John and Martha had been up and dressed, listening carefully to every instruction their father had given them. Good-byes had been said and Nancy had stood in front of the cabin, holding each of the children - by the hand, until her husband had _ disappeared around the bend in the road, John had then withdrawn his hand from his mother's, for hadn't father made him head of the house during his absence? Then, with his shoulders thrown back, and his blue eyes sparkling with the magnitude of his new responsibility, he had looked at his mother and small sister, and echoed a phrase of his father's, "Time's a passing, so better get to our chores." Nancy had smiled at her children and gone into the cabin to "get to her chores," while John had hurried down the path toward the woodpile with six-year-old Martha coming on behind as fast as her short, stubby legs would let her. Jim Parker had sawed and split a huge pile of white pine and maple for the children to put in the lean-to shed just around the northern comer of the cabin. John had begun loading a pile of the big chunks in the crook of his arm, while Martha gathered the small kindling pieces. Back and forth they had gone until not one chunk was left. Then, tucking her long, black curls further under her bright red cap, Martha 523 had followed her brother as he fed the cows and pigs. Feeding the chickens had been their last chore. When John, imitating his father, had given her the task, Martha gleefully began laying tiny handfuls of wheat in a wide circle, counting each one, to be sure each of the fourteen fowls had her own share. Late in the afternoon Nancy had helped her son feed and milk the cows. Back in the cabin, Nancy had frequently left her work to glance through the window at the children, to assure herself that they were all tight. Although she had lived as a neighbor to the Indians for three years, she was still nervous when the children were out of the cabin. Her work had gone more smoothly after John and Martha had come in, early in the evening, removed their coats and toboggan caps, and sat by the fireplace carefully turning the pages of an old mail-order catalogue which Nancy had brought with her from Indiana. SUDDENLY Nancy's thoughts were interrupted. Dropping her knitting, she riveted her eyes on the heavily bolted door, shaken by loud knocking. Fear seized her and she gripped the arms of her chair. The knocking sounded again. Nancy arose and: went to the door, Sliding back the bolt, she felt certain she knew what she would see outside, and glanced at the gift-filled flour sack. But, instead of a begging old squaw croaking, "Give biscuit, Shoshone hungry," a tall, willow-straight Indian came into the room, rolled by two blanketed braves. The firelight sparkled in and out among the beads around his 524 magnificent headdress of many colored feathers, which rippled almost to the floor. The awe-inspiring presence of the great chief of the Shoshone Indians was terrifying to the small, dark-haired pioneer woman who stood before him. Chief Many Feathers spoke first. "White squaw go. Take papoose, or� Nancy's trembling lips parted to ask why. The chief went on, "Evil god of white man come. Descend for many days on Shoshone Chief wigwam. White man go, take evil one from body of Little Star." Nancy had never seen Little Star, but she knew she was the chief's daughter. The chief stood proudly erect, his arms folded, but his somber eyes were full of sorrow, an emotion unbefitting to a chief. Every pioneer had heard of the cruelties of some of the Indians, the Shoshone included. Nancy knew her position was precarious. There was but one thing to do. Guided by the same spirit that had made her a pioneer, she looked straight at Chief Many Feathers and said, "White squaw come, take care of Little Star, make her well again." Nancy could feel the eyes of the three tribesmen as they gazed at her. Many Feathers refused. "No, White squaw go. Take away evil one.". Desperation driving her on, Nancy began telling the chief what to do for his child. He listened as she explained each step, then he said, "White squaw come." The young mother quickly RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE AUGUST 1946 awakened her children, explaining what had happened as she helped them dress. Chief Many Feathers and his braves stood silent and erect near the door watching Nancy and her children. When John and Martha were dressed, Nancy put on her own coat and tied a blue shawl over her hair. She hurriedly took a clean, small bag from a shelf covered by brightly flowered calico curtains, and began filling it with all the things she would need. Before blowing out the lamp, she glanced around the cabin. Her eyes noticed the sack in the comer, but fearing to offend the Chief, she left it. Nancy followed Chief Many Feathers out the door with her children; the two braves came last. Stepping out into the night air, she noted with surprise that the heavy fog had lifted, and a small, pale moon showed through the clouds. The climb to the Shoshone village was an easy one. The chief, followed by his braves, led the way. Nancy came behind with John and Martha. None of the Indians offered any assistance; assisting a squaw would have been beneath the dignity of either a chief or a brave. Knowing this, Nancy did not expect help. The chief climbed silently and swiftly. The braves followed close behind him. The moon lighted the smooth, gently curving path. Nancy and the children moved almost as quietly as their escorts. But their pace was so swift, and the air so crisp, that soon it became difficult for them to breathe, and they fell some distance behind. Not until the Indians had reached NIGHT CALLERS the crest of the mountain did Chief Many Feathers look back. Standing tall, with folded arms, his face serene, he resembled a mighty statue in the moonlight as he waited for them to catch up. CHIEF MANY FEATHERS led -~ the way down into his village, then into a large, deerskin-covered wigwam. Near the fire lay a pile of furs and on top of them lay Little Star, with her mother, Yellow Blossom, sitting beside her. The child had the brown-skinned beauty of the Shoshone. Her hair was shining black and smooth; long braids lay on the dark furs beside her hot, drawn face. She breathed rapidly. Nancy fell on her knees beside the little Indian girl. She knew at once what must be done. Motioning to John, she instructed him to take the contents of the small, white bag and set them beside the mound of furs. An old squaw was ordered to bring hot water. Nancy gently removed the soft, doeskin dress of her tiny patient and began rubbing her chest and back with camphor and lard, until it became warm against her hand. A short time later she swiftly mixed a small amount of mustard, flour, and water which she spread on a clean white piece of cloth and applied it to her patient's chest. Chief Many Feathers and Yellow Blossom sat on the opposite side of the fire watching as Nancy rubbed and poulticed Little Star. John and Martha watched also, much too excited to sleep. The remainder of the night seemed hours long. While Nancy waited and worked with her patient, she began thinking of the con- 525 sequences if her efforts to save the chief's daughter should fail. Night finally passed, as did the next day. Nancy spent the time applying poultices, rubbing, and feeding the child hot herb tea. Fear kept her at her post and sleep from her eyes. The chief and his wife never left their side of the blazing fire. Very late the second morning Little Star's dark forehead felt cooler under the gentle touch of Nancy's hand. She was overjoyed, but she did not dare tell Chief Many Feathers and Yellow Blossom so soon. The hours passed; daylight came, and with it the assurance that Little Star would get well. The fever had gone and she slept soundly. After many hours of restful sleep, Little Star awoke. Chief Many Feathers and Yellow Blossom arose and came to her. Taking John and Martha by the hand, Nancy left them alone with their child. Outside the sky was brilliant blue, and the warm sun was high and golden. Climbing up the path, Nancy looked down into the valley from the top of the mountain above the Indian village. Suddenly, she realized that her husband would be home that evening. Taking the children, she hurried back down the path to the chief's wigwam. As she entered, Little Star smiled up at her from her luxurious fur bed. Chief Many Feathers stood before her with Yellow Blossom at his side. Their gratitude was overwhelming. In his efforts to thank her the chief's eyes became unnaturally bright, and (Continued on page 550) Photographing Your Children Willard Luce ILMS are back! Well, anyway, there's a roll in the store every once in awhile. But they don't stay long. Films have been scarce too long, and there are many children who have never had their pictures taken. This is especially true in the smaller towns which are unable to support a regular photographer. But films are back. There will be a better supply this summer, and more and more fond parents will be shaking the dust from their cameras to get a picture of little Johnnie or Betty. Yes, films are back, but it will be a long, long time before we can splash in the luxury of shooting a whole roll for one or two good prints. They should all be good. And now when thousands of fine pictures are published every month, our own attempts at photography should be better and more interesting than the usual snapshot. Any person, child or adult, who is forced to stand straight and stiff in front of a camera is ill at ease. It's the same feeling that comes to a child who walks onto a stage and sees forty dozen eyes staring right at him. He swallows a couple of times, and thinks maybe he ought to smile and he does. At least, he gets his lips twisted in the right direction, but his eyes aren't smiling, and his hands aren't smiling. All in all, he looks and acts about as comfortable as a cat in a dog show. Then, there is the snapshooter Page 526 who invariably stands the child in front of a tree. Most of the trunk is hidden by the child's body, and the rest seems to be growing right out of the top of his head. Now, some people don't mind that. Maybe they never studied botany and don't know trees aren't supposed to grow out of people's heads. But it isn't good photography. Which brings us to perhaps the two most important points in the photography of people backgrounds and posing. With only one exception, the accompanying photographs were taken BRUSHING UP OPERATIONS Watch your backgrounds! PHOTOGRAPHING YOUR CHILDREN 527 LIFE BEGINS ANY TIME Here are two pictures instead of one. The little girl at the left has no connection with the storytelling pose of the other two. Using the sky for the background. With proper filters and film, the sky can be made any shade from pure white to black. Even the clouds are not usually distracting, but rather give the impression of an outdoor atmosphere which is pleasing. The background of sky is certainly much better than the tree already mentioned, or a clothesline, billboard, telephone pole, and even trash pile. Some of these may seem a little far-fetched, but I have seen every one of them used, not once, but any number of times. It is well to understand here that it is sometimes better to use a poor background rather than to completely lose a picture. The photograph of the three children has an annoying background, as well as including two pictures instead of one. But to have worried about these would certainly have lost the interesting expressions on the two girls' faces. Little can be done about the background, but the two pictures can be separated in the darkroom either by enlarging or by masking. Place your hand over the smaller girl. You have left a storytelling picture of a small girl and boy holding hands, without the distraction of the first girl, who seems to have no connection whatsoever with the story. Cover the girl and the boy up, and you have the second picture. As for posing I don't know why people "freeze" when they face a camera, but they do. I "freeze," and most everyone I know does the same thing. When my son was only two years old, he would sit up and put on a smile that was as artificial as apple-blossoms at the North Pole, at the mere sight of me setting up the camera. Very few people are at ease in front of a camera. It's the photographer's job to talk them into relaxing or, better still, to give them something to do so that they can entirely forget the camera. FASHION PARADE Most children love to dress up, and all dressed up children make good camera subjects IN every picture in this series the child is doing something. There is really nothing a child likes to do better than to dress up. Girls gather up their mothers' old dresses and nigh-heeled shoes. With no more than that, they will play and parade by the hour, offering more entertainment for the bystander than a four-ring circus. Certainly there is camera material here. Even a belt is sometimes enough to make a boy feel dressed up and mature. Give him a belt, and he will swagger in a way that will make James Cagney resemble Little Lord Fauntleroy. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE AUGUST 1946 The girl at the lamppost was given a big hat and a purse, and posed in the manner of the fashion photographers of a former day. A bigger purse would have been even better. Right here is a good point to remember study the magazines and notice how the people ate posed, both in the illustrations and in the advertisements. If you find a Power's model posed in a way to suggest an interesting pose for your own child, try it. And you don't always have to be on a level with a model. Having the camera either below or above the model is often more effective, and breaks the monotony of repetition. Most of the accompanying photos were taken from a low camera angle. PUPPY LOVE The introduction of a pet into the photograph takes the child's attention from himself and places it on the pet. PHOTOGRAPHING YOUR CHILDREN CAMERA SHY Crying is often a more interesting, and, certainly, a truer expression than a forced smile. Another effective means of relaxing the child is to pose him with a pet a boy with his dog, or a boy with his horse. The mere presence of the pet forces the child's attention away from himself to his pet; and that is usually all that is necessary. The old cliche of "look at the birdie and smile" is as outmoded as the Wright Brothers' airplane. The child needs neither to look at the birdie nor to smile. In fact, just to watch some photographer sneak up on an unsuspecting child is enough not only to make the child scream, but the mother as well. However, a child, crying, lends much human interest, and certainly offers a more natural expression than a forced smile. 529 Framing the child in a doorway, a window, or in the square of a lattice gives the child something to do and provides an effective frame. With backgrounds of this type, however, you have to be especially. Careful of the way the light strikes the model. As most of you will have box cameras, or folding cameras, with little or no variation in focusing distance, it will be difficult to get closer to your models than eight feet. 'This is not necessarily as much of a handicap as you might, at first, suppose. Most photo finishers do enlarging, and will enlarge any section of a negative you desire. 'Then, too, portrait attachments which work GIVE A MAN A HORSE Just sitting on his favorite mount gives a boy a relaxed, at-home feeling which carries over into the photograph. 530 DISTANT HORIZONS Portrait attachments help to get closer to the subject. Adding the bicycle makes this informal portrait more interesting than a straight head shot would have been. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE AUGUST 1946 quite satisfactorily can be purchased. The same principles apply to a portrait that apply to any other picture. Merely asking the model to hold up his bicycle and look down the road, helps him to forget himself and makes for a more natural photograph. Of course, the inclusion of the handle bars or some part of the bicycle is necessary to round out the storytelling quality of the picture. And, contrary to the general belief that the sun must shine from behind the camera, the poser's features are much better modeled and more interesting if the light comes from one side and above. And remember, it isn't the camera half as much as the imagination, patience, and planning of the photographer, that determines the final product. STRANGER Jessie Miller Robinson In reverie, today, I met her  A creature fairylike with joy, I wondered how I could forget her, Allow the long years to destroy Our star-paved dreams, and love to cloy. Always with trust she met the morrow; Her thoughts were buds of purity, And brief as rain in spring, her sorrow: In faith she prayed, believing God Was good.... The child I used to be. THIS SILENT BARD Evelyn Fjelsted A rose, an affirmation of Life's wondrous beauty and reward, We hear its floral sermon, Pay tribute to this silent bard. A miracle that tells of love, In language understood by all, Whose influence benign, so like A benediction seems to fall. A mystery, this vision fair, Could it have strayed from worlds unseen, To be a guest in gardens here, A stranger on this mundane scene? And whence and how it came, who knows? A rose diffusing perfume rare, Whose silent glory testifies That God is here and everywhere.  Heavenly Harmony Rachel B. Ballantyne Do you ever stop and think how much the heavenly bodies the sun, moon, and stars are like a family of people? As they perform their work so faithfully and undeviatingly, they seem to be giving a silent lesson, day after day, as to how people could live and conduct their lives in order to have peace and harmony in their homes. If we could catch the lesson so beautifully portrayed above us, it would ensure happiness to the inmates of our earthly homes. Let us call the sun the father. He rises first in the morning, looks over the mountains, and sends a smile of radiance over this beautiful world of ours, then mounts the sky in power and splendor and, from his high vantage, sees and touches every detail of his responsible work, which is a mighty factor in keeping our world productive that life may exist hereon. In the evening, his work finished, he retires to rest. Then the moon, we'll call the mother, a dainty, silver rim, appears and calls her star children out to play and twinkle. After games, she retires. But each evening she returns, stays a little longer, that her influence and activity may give added light and effectiveness until she is full and glorious in gold and silver splendor, soaring and reigning queen of the night. Then, as she begins to weary, her triumphal beauty wanes, little by little, until she retires into a natural period of rest, away from public gaze. The star children are left to light the traveler's way and do their part in dispelling darkness, and to carry on in shining loveliness, for a season, alone. Thus, each planet and each orb has its opportunity in making this the grand old world it is. The father's task is much the same, day after day, carrying on in unwavering strength. The mother's work is more varied, but not less important in the plan. In all nature, as in the gospel plan, harmony prevails, giving each creation a place and a responsibility.

Page 533 EDITORIAL 9 VOL. 33 AUGUST 1946 Personal Development Through Service "He who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward" (Doc. And Cov. 59:23). OVER half of the Relief Society membership is engaged in service to the organization either as ward or stake officers, or as visiting teachers. These women have, for the most part, accepted their callings without thought of the personal development they would gain, but have entered into their work with zeal and enthusiasm, thinking only of ways and means to further the progress of the Relief Society. However, the Lord has promised us that: "He who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward," and all who work in the Relief Society benefit not only the Church, but themselves as well. Every one of us has potential abilities and talents, just as she has potential physical strength in her body. If the arms and legs are never used, the potential physical strength is undeveloped. Just so, if one does not use her special abilities and talents, they cannot be expected to develop and be of use to others. The women who work in Relief Society find many ways and opportunities to develop, because the program is so wide and varied. In general, these women develop spiritually and mentally, and they acquire many homemaking skills. Specifically, Relief Society women develop their talents according to their callings, as for example, the women occupying executive Page 534 positions. These women gain confidence and poise and the ability to stand before large gatherings and conduct meetings according to accepted procedure. Who in all the Relief Society gains as much from the lesson as the class leader herself? Many times, the teacher has taught herself a more valuable lesson than that received by the class members. The work meeting, the participation of Relief Society in the Welfare Program, the visiting teaching program, the Singing Mothers all furnish a wide variety of opportunities for self-service. Many times Relief Society sisters have been called to fill positions for which they felt inadequate and unqualified. However, these women have been magnified in their callings and made equal to the tasks before them. Later, these women have borne testimony to the development they, personally, received as they performed the duties, which they had felt were far beyond their capabilities. While Relief Society women do not accept positions for the personal advancement they may receive therefrom, yet we do recognize that great development comes to them, and are thankful that this is one of the rewards for them "who doeth the works of righteousness."  G. R. G. Notes TO THE FIELD Annual Relief Society General Conference THE annual Relief Society general conference will be held in Salt Lake City, Wednesday and Thursday, October 2 and 3, 1946. All stakes are urged to have in attendance as many of their stake board members as possible, since all the activities of Relief Society will be presented in departmental sessions on Wednesday, October 2. A reception for stake and mission officers and stake board members will be held on Wednesday evening from 8 p. M. To 10 P. M. In the Lafayette Ballroom, Hotel Utah. The final session, Thursday afternoon, to be held in the Tabernacle, will be open to the general membership of Relief Society. Detailed programs for all the conference sessions will be mailed to stakes and missions at an early date. HES May Anderson Friend of the Children 1864 - 1946 THE General Board of Relief Society, on behalf of the membership in all the stakes and missions of the Church, pays tribute at this time to the memory of Sister May Anderson. Long devoted to the service of children, Sister Anderson passed away June 10, 1946, at the age of eighty-two. She served the Primary Association with great devotion for forty-eight years, acting as secretary of the General Board, as a counselor, and, from 1925 to 1939, as general president. Under her enthusiastic and untiring direction, the Children's Friend was founded; her energy and her vision were largely responsible for the success of the Primary Children's Hospital. Sister Anderson's interests were varied, her talents outstanding. Thousands of children and their parents remember May Anderson with love and gratitude. Her influence and her sympathetic service will be of lasting benefit to the organization which she served so well, and to all who are devoted to the welfare of children. - Page 535 Menus By the Day Or By the Week Phyllis Snow Home Service Director, Mountain Fuel Supply Company O you plan your menus by the meal, by the day, or by the week, and have your results been all that you would wish? Most homemakers find that planning for only one or two meals at a time is likely to result in poorly balanced menus, unnecessary rush and worry and extra shopping, and that money becomes ever scarcer as the end of the month draws ever nearer. Planning by the week has been found to be much mote satisfactory, especially in balancing menus. Some foods are needed every day, and some only three or four times a week. By looking at all seven days at once, we can be certain that all the necessities will be included. The seven-day plan helps the budget, too. Instead of serving chicken, steak, and chops soon after payday, as we are tempted to do when we plan by the day of meal, we shall find it easy to scatter these delicacies over the week, and thus keep up the family's interest in meals. Having a written market list saves time when we go to the store, for we can buy in one trip all of the staples, canned goods, and potatoes that we shall need during the week. Of course, menus are subject to change! All of us know that invitations out to dinner, unexpected Page 536 guests, or other emergencies may alter plans. But this need not be a problem. Perishables can be kept in the refrigerator. Even greens will keep garden fresh in the hydrator sections. Revisions in your meals can be easily made. Set aside a definite period of time for meal planning. This may require an hour or two if the meals are to be well-balanced from all standpoints, and, at the same time, kept within the bounds of your food allowance! Thursday or Friday is a good day in which to plan the menus, for you can start with the week-end meals, and any tidbits left from Sunday may be used to good advantage early in the week. It is easier to write out all seven breakfasts first and then to plan the dinners. Finally, balance each day's account nutritionally with the lunches or suppers. Menus should be simple, and it is well to keep in mind that tasty, nutritious food, spick-and-span cleanliness, attractive table settings, proper table manners, and pleasant conversation all contribute to a successful meal. It is the combination of these, rather than a series of "fancy dishes," that is important! To make your planning easy, and to be certain that all food essentials are included in your meals, try using MENUS BY THE DAY OR BY THE WEEK the following outlines which have been devised by leading authorities in the field of nutrition, medicine, and homemaking, and which have MINIMUM DAILY REQUIREMENTS 537 been accepted as being among the most vital contributions that have been made to good eating in recent years.

Faith Is a Heritage Christie Lund Coles CHAPTER 5 Synopsis: Enid, wife of Tom Drage, who was killed in a factory accident, is faced with the problem of rearing her daughter Sharon. The factory makes a settlement, and Miss Nobbitt, the landlady, offers to take care of Sharon while Enid finishes the schooling required for a teacher's certificate. In Salt. Lake City, Enid registers at the University and begins her school work. She goes for a ride with Milo Ross, a fellow student. HE knew he was going to kiss her unless she acted swiftly. So, as his lips would have touched hers, she turned her head, at the same time pushing him from her with both hands. He tried to take her hands into his free one, as he said, "Don't tell me you�re going to be prudish. I like you." "If not letting you kiss me is being prudish, then I'm certainly going to be just that," she told him simply, flatly, "and if you don't mind I'd like to go home." There was that in her tone that told him she meant what she said. He straightened up, his mouth becoming sulkier than ever as he said, "Okay. You sound exactly like a school teacher." Her laugh was a little hysterical as she admitted, "I'm going to be a school teacher. And I'm glad of it. For that matter, I'm even glad that I give the impression of cramming, because I'm doing that, too. The sooner I finish, the sooner I can leave here and go home." Page 542 "There must be somebody very special waiting for you." "There is somebody very special," she assured him. He started the car and they drove toward town in silence. She found herself feeling just a little sorry for him, so wrapped was she in her own joy of thinking of the little town, Miss Nobbitt's large, old-fashioned house... And Sharon. Oh, yes, especially Sharon. The summer ended and Enid went home. The peaceful, uneventful weeks passed into months, and the months into another year, and Enid received her degree to teach. She put it carefully away in a bottom dresser drawer there to remain until the time would come when she and Sharon could go together to the red schoolhouse in the east part of town. The time passed so swiftly that that day came sooner than she had believed possible. Sharon's school started one Monday morning before the junior high school in which Enid was to teach. She had bought Sharon an adorable dress and hat for the occasion. It was an extravagance, but she wanted Sharon to look her very prettiest. Now, as she tied the large yellow sash and adjusted a golden yellow curl, she felt she had never seen anything more beautiful than this child of hers. But Sharon was frightened and a little dismayed. FAITH IS A HERITAGE "You'll stay there with me, won't you, Mommie?" she asked, her eyes dark and anxious. Enid told her, "I can't stay with you very long. But I will stay as long as possible. You mustn't be frightened, honey, most of the children are just little boys and girls that you know." "But there will be so many," the child lamented. Enid smiled, understanding that natural fear of great crowds. One or two people could always be met easily, but there was something about a group that made one feel alone and lonely. And Sharon was a shy little thing, anyway, sensitive and aloof. Enid had adjusted her own new hat at just the proper angle. She took Sharon's hand, and they started up the street together toward the schoolhouse, where the bell, high in the belfry, was already beginning to ring.   she entered the kindergarten room, especially when she saw that. The. Teacher was a young woman whom she had seen around town and who had always given her the impression of being proud and haughty. The impression was heightened when she introduced herself and Sharon. The girl glanced at the child, briefly, and, without looking directly at Enid, said, "She'll get along all night.". Enid asked, a bit hesitantly, "Is it all right if I stay a few moments?" "If you wish," she replied briefly. Then she told the child to be seated, and Enid walked to the back of the room where she found a chair and sat down. Her own legs shook just a little as 543. During the opening moments of the class, she caught Sharon looking around almost frantically for her, and she leaned forward smiling so that she would be in her line of vision. Unfortunately, Miss Hare, the teacher, saw, too, and a look of derision crossed her face. It was almost as though Enid could read her thoughts. She was probably thinking, Here is a spoiled youngster; they are poor, yet look at her clothes... AFTER a few moments, Miss Hare announced she would call the roll, and asked each child to raise his hand as his name was called. She started down the list. Sharon sat watching her, waiting for her name to be called. When the list was finished she put it aside, and still Sharon sat watching her, disappointed, still hoping that she would remember her mistake and call her name. But the teacher did not. Enid tried to tell herself that it was not deliberate, that it was unimportant and she wrinkled her nose at her daughter when she turned to her, trying to give assurance that it wasn't important. Later, Miss Hare asked how many of the children knew how to spell "cat." Sharon, among others, lifted her hand. When the teacher saw it, she said, "All right then, you, spell in Sharon stood up, looked about the room, and her face blanched. Enid could see her lower lip tremble as she tried to get the letters out and could not. Miss Hare turned from her to the board, saying sharply, sarcastically, 'I thought you knew how to spell 544 Sharon sat down and Enid felt as if she had been lashed with a cat-o'- nine-tails. Nothing in her own life had ever hurt her like this. Yet, she knew if she interceded, if she gave way to the emotions in her, it would be harder on Sharon than ever. The teacher would be even more unkind and Sharon would be more hurt. Enid decided to try and pass over the experience lightly, and to make Sharon believe there was some reason behind it, that the teacher was probably upset the first day, and was just thoughtless, that the slights didn't mean anything. But when Enid arrived home, she threw herself on the bed, and cried, bitterness and anger welling up in her. If ever she had a chance, she vowed, she would strike out against that kind of teaching. Sarcasm had no place in the handling of children... They were too fundamentally good, too untouched to be exposed to its sharp spears. Not only her own child deserved something better, but all children everywhere deserved to be treated with respect and kindness. Enid discovered to her amazement, when Sharon came home, that she seemed to have forgotten the incident. She quickly changed her clothes and ran outside to play with some neighbor children. They weren't the best-dressed nor the best-behaved children in town. Enid had had this truth brought home to her today when she had looked around the classroom and noticed the children from the homes on the east side of town. But what could she do? She had signed her contract now, and was bound to teach in this town. If she hadn't, she RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE AUGUST 1946 thought desperately, she would have left the town and never returned. After all, there was no one to bind her here.. Except Miss Nobbitt. But she really had been good to her, and she owed her a great deal. She would have to stay, of course. Things would work out. No one could know Sharon and not love her. Not even Miss Hare, Enid reflected hopefully. The next few days Enid was busy getting started with her own teaching. She felt a little shy among the carefree boys and girls she taught, who were at the age most difficult - to understand thirteen to fifteen years old some of them even sixteen. Yet, it had not been so very long since she had been that age herself. She could still remember the adjustments so difficult to make. She didn't believe young people were bad, fundamentally, only misunderstood, misdirected, and their only defense was youthful defiance. After the first few days, she was sure she was going to like teaching; she was sure that, on the whole, the children would be co-operative. Her thoughts were brought back to Sharon and to her teacher on a particular Friday when the child walked over to the high school building to meet her. "Hello," Enid greeted her happily as she saw her small figure in the doorway. "Come in. See the room where your mother teaches." The child walked in rather slowly, and Enid noticed the paleness of her face, the unhappy expression in her eyes. "What is it?" she asked, rising to reach her hand out to her, "Anything gone wrong?" FAITH IS A HERITAGE "No," Sharon said shortly, avoiding her mother's eyes, pretending to be interested in the blackboard beyond her. Enid didn't want to press the issue. She didn't want to put any ideas into her daughter's mind if none were there. She only asked casually, "How's school? Is Miss Hare nice?" She was unprepared for the sudden burst of tears, the fury of the words that came from the child. "No," she cried, sobbing, "she's mean. She says mean things to me. I don't like her, Mommie. She doesn't like me. She.. Doesn't.. 'like.. Me." The last was a heartbroken wail that held all the sorrow and misery of childhood. Enid felt a pain like a vise pressing within her breast. She gathered the child into her arms, feeling her own tears, her own anger rising to overflowing. But she kept silent until she was able to say, rather calmly, "I'm sure it isn't that bad. I'm sure she likes you. She is just gg busy, there are so many children.. Sharon shook her head in silent disagreement and Enid held her more tightly in her arms, as if, by doing so, she could protect her against anything that might ever hurt Sharon again. Enid wanted to cry out, but again she forced herself to say quietly, though she was trembling, "Why don't you take this dime and run over and get us a couple of ice-cream cones while I finish up here. Then, we'll walk home together." Sharon's face brightened momentarily as Enid dried her eyes, and in a moment she was off to the store. 545 That night when the child was asleep in her small bed, Enid sat in the lamplight, biting the end of a pen, staring at the white paper before her. Suddenly, the words seemed to start themselves and she began writing.. Swiftly.. Short, terse phrases... "I do not ask anything for my child that I do not ask for every child in the room.... The chance to be treated fairly.. An encouraging word for work well done..." She filled up the page, signed her name, folded it. Then she slipped it into an envelope, addressed it slowly, almost painfully. She wished there were some other way. She could go to the teacher in person, but she was afraid of her own emotions, afraid she would not be able to say what she wished to say. She sealed the envelope and set it beside the lamp where she would see it in the morning. Sometime, during the still hours, when the tears had spent themselves and she was staring into the darkness, it was almost as though a voice said to her, "Pray for those who despitefully use you." It seemed incredible to think of... To pray for Miss Hare with her haughtiness, her sharp tongue. Yet, as Enid thought of it, she was forced to admit that perhaps there was something back of it, some deep reason for her actions. Perhaps, it was a defense of some sort. How could one judge another.... Wise and gentle beyond her years, Enid closed her eyes and prayed for Miss Hare, prayed for her child. Prayed for wisdom for herself.

Dalton, President, Timpanogos Stake Relief Society 550 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE AUGUST 1946 The Importance of Thrift (Continued from page 509) established themselves firmly and securely "in the midst of the Rocky Mountains." Thrift is rooted deeply in human life and reflects the character of a people. Personal discipline and personal sacrifice are necessary to a strong character. Relief for the unfortunate and those handicapped calls for a great emotion, and can be supplied only by those who work and save. The modern world has been beguiled into a false sense of security and, sooner or later, it must learn that no social device can take the place of thrifty habits, frugal living, and hard work, in making people economically secure and politically free and independent.  Night Callers (Continued from page 525) his speech lapsed into his native Shoshone. Turning, he summoned his braves to his side and ordered all his people to come to the great lodge. The lodge was a high, long tepee, covered with buffalo skins and filled, for decoration, with the heads of many animals. Nancy and her children were given the seat of honor beside the chief and his braves. The celebration began with a tribal dance. A young brave, dressed in brilliant scarlet and black, came into the center of the lodge. Thirty braves, painted and enveloped in beads and tiny bells, formed a large circle around him. At the sound of his drum, they all began moving in perfect unison. The dance was followed by a feast. Pumpkin, potatoes, corn, deer steaks, everything that the tribe had, was brought to Nancy, seated beside the chief. At the close of the feast, Nancy explained to her host her need for returning to her cabin in' the valley. Chief Many Feathers consented, and accompanied them down the mountain into the valley. They arrived at the door of the cabin just as the sun was slipping behind the peaks of the western mountains. As there were no wagon tracks in the soft, powdery earth, Nancy knew that Jim had not yet returned. At the door of the cabin, Chief Many Feathers stopped. Raising his arms, he removed a beautiful handwoven red, yellow, and blue blanket from around his broad shoulders. Stooping, he gently placed it around Nancy, and, for the first time, his face lost its stern look of noble dignity in a smile. He said, "Great Spirit of Shoshone children, keep evil one from wigwam of white princess." Nancy, unable to speak, grasped a hand of each of her children, and through her tears she watched the great chief swiftly climb the mountain path back to his people. LESSON Theology Church History Lesson I8 The Priesthood Quorums Expanded Elder H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, November 5, 1946 Objective: To show that the worthy male membership of the Church is eligible to  STN my name they shall do many wonderful works," were the words of the Master to Joseph Smith and six elders assembled at Kirtland, Ohio, in September of the year 1832 (Doc. And Cov. 84:66). It was at this time that more light was thrown upon the Priesthood and its great powers and blessings for man. In my name they shall cast out devils; In my name they shall heal the sick; in my name they shall open the eyes of the blind, and unstop the ears of the deaf; And the tongue of the dumb shall speak; And if any man shall administer poison unto them it shall not hurt them. And the poison of a serpent shall not have power to harm them (Doc. And Cov. 84:67-72). Now, to note the next verse: But a commandment I give unto them; that they shall not boast themselves of these things, neither speak them before the world; for these things are given unto you for your profit and for salvation. The Lord would give unto all his sons, who had become worthy, the power he himself possessed to perform great works. And to what end? To the end that all who sought him might profit and gain personal salvation. Here is true brotherhood. In the Lord's Church, the plan is to have members banned together fraternally as a devoted body, and to work out a personal salvation b actively striving for others. This means that each male member of the Church must be given an equal chance with all others to act officially in the name of the Lord in matters pertaining to gospel ordinances. Hence came the holy Priesthood. It is a known fact today in sociology, that for successful group cooperation, there must needs be an equality of privilege, at least in so far as membership rights are concerned. How such a principle has been applied to the lay membership of churches of the world today still begs for an answer. In matters of religious ordinance and ritual it is only the priests or ministers who have the opportunity to act for the group. To select the few who might be granted powers, can but leave the average church convert a_ passive bystander. He will but look in upon ways of serving the Lord. Page 55] receive the powers and blessings of the Priesthood.. 552 It was apparent from the very beginning of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that the Lord had "his friends" (Doc. And Cov. 84:77), all of them, joining hands in the great call to serve. Every worthy member of the Church might expect the call for leadership in the Priesthood. But the plan of the Priesthood, as divinely instituted, means more than just providing men with the opportunity to serve in positions of trust. As a mortal, man sooner or later must face the personal problems of life in an intimate way. Sickness strikes, and medical aid fails. Help must come from a higher source. Trouble comes, and one feels the need to seek divine guidance. A child arrives at the age of baptism. A father's natural hope is to desire the right to perform all these ordinances for the family members. In the true Church, these personal privileges of a sacred nature may be performed by any worthy father in Zion who bears the Priesthood of God and receives the authorization from the man who holds the keys. The Lord has provided in his Priesthood for individual satisfaction as well as group service. All worthy members may have the right to act in his name, from the head of the Church to the last ordained member. Training for an understanding of this concept begins early. Boys at the age of twelve are ordained to the lesser Priesthood after the order of Aaron, as deacons. In company with other members of his quorum, each boy is assigned to the temporal duties of the Church by his bishop. He collects fast offerings, helps keep the chapel and its grounds RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE AUGUST 1946 attractive, serves on welfare projects, passes the Lord's sacrament at meetings, and responds to many other worthwhile assignments. These are duties all deacons can perform. For those in the quorum who show leadership, the call comes to serve as president, counselors, or secretary. While such offices require more responsibility, they do not add any additional rights to the office of a deacon which the least member in - the quorum holds. Not many years pass before a boy ordained as a deacon may be advanced to a teacher, and then to a priest which office is the highest in the lesser Priesthood. Within each of these callings are certain added responsibilities. These quicken a youth's religious convictions and function in his life because they provide him with activities that are of positive worth to his fellow quorum members and his Church. When the time arrives that a boy comes to the estate of young manhood, he may, through his worthiness, be advanced to the office of an elder. This calling sets him apart as a holder of the higher Priesthood after the order of Melchizedek, the great high priest who lived during the days of Abraham, and to whom Abraham came to pay tithes and offerings. The higher Priesthood bears the name of Melchizedek by express command for the purpose of avoiding the constant use of its real name, the Holy Priesthood of the Order of the Son of God. It is to this order that all worthy adult male members of the Church belong. Only special callings within this Priesthood set men apart as LESSON DEPARTMENT presidents, members of the Quorum of the Twelve, Seventies, etc. Every worthy father in Israel has the knowledge of the right this Priesthood gives him to administer to the sick, conduct a sacrament service for his family (if he lives apart from an organized ward or branch of the Church), and to teach his children the way of life with conviction as to his authoritative right to teach. In fact, such powers of the Priesthood as are given to all worthy members of the Lord's Church are so inclusive as to be the way of all life and good living both for here and hereafter. Once the full significance of the great plan of brotherhood, brought about through the function of the Priesthood, became clear to the members of the Church, the steady and enduring growth of God's kingdom upon earth was assured. It was as though the Lord had scattered abroad the good seeds of life which he knew would root and grow into the individual testimonies of thousands and thousands of saints. Today, throughout the world, Priesthood quorums are expanding. The pattern of these organizations has been so clearly marked and tested through the hundred years of growth that wherever groups of people come together and embrace 553 the faith there can be set up, immediately, the order of the Priesthood to provide the foundation and framework of the plan of life that builds character into the lives of boys and men. / These are the basic principles upon which the Lord, who is "no respecter of persons" (Acts 10:34), has builded his great Church in our day, until now, we no longer talk in terms of personalities and the personal drama of stirring events such as were known in the tender years of the little flock "who heard and believed the Prophet Joseph"; rather have we come to measure our strength in areas scattered over the face of the earth where our stakes, and our Priesthood quorums by the thousands, now exist. Yet beneath all these figures there still rests the simplicity of the gospel principle of brotherhood, upon which all great things are builded. Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggested reading given below, have the class carry on the discussion as follows: First answer the question; second, read the assigned part of the text to discover wherein we must "give heed unto his word." 1. The Lord has promised great things, as well as given words of warning to those who would obtain the two Priesthoods in his Church. What has he said? Read Doc. And Cov. 84: 32-41. > THE NEW TESTAMENT Dorothy ]. Roberts 'And Jesus said...." Here are his words Brought safely through the ages down to me, And, though I cannot thank the ones who saved them, I read, believing they were meant for me. 554 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE AUGUST 1946 Visiting Teachers' Messages Our Pioneer Heritage Lesson 2 Love of Fellow Man President Amy Brown Lyman For Tuesday, November 5, 1946 Objective: To show that the pioneers possessed the qualities of character necessary to live the "second great commandment," love of neighbor. And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? He said unto him, What is written in the law? How readest thou? And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself. And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live. But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, and who is my neighbor? (Luke 10:25-29). |e made answer by giving the parable of the good Samaritan, thus indicating that all men are neighbors to each other and should render unselfish and helpful service to their fellow men. After thus describing the unselfish service of the good Samaritan, he then said to the lawyer, "Go, and do thou likewise." It takes real strength of character as well as unselfishness to be neighborly and charitable in the broad sense which Jesus thus taught and thus emphasized. This doctrine is so strong and includes so much self-giving and self-sacrifice that living it strictly is a real test of strength. Church history, as well as the pioneer stories which have come down to us, testify to the neighborliness, co-operation, and true charity practiced by the Mormon pioneers.   Because of their common experiences, their common needs, and their common problems, they could well understand the inward feelings and desires, the hardships, sufferings, and heartaches of one another. They therefore sacrificed and shared together, they comforted one another, and thus helped to carry one another's burdens. In their preparation for the great western march and especially during the journey the pioneers traded and loaned their scant belongings, they divided and shared whatever they had in the way of food, clothing, bedding, and other supplies. One of the rules they adopted was, "Every man is to put as much interest in taking care of his brother's cattle as he would his own. And no man will be indulged in idleness." In those companies where space in the wagons for passengers was limited, and when there was hard pulling for the animals, in whatever wagons there was space, preference was given to little children, the aged, and those who were ill. After they reached the Valley, their co-operative efforts continued, and the stupendous work they accomplished in the first years was the result of their unselfishness; and LESSON DEPARTMENT the fraternal spirit that united and held them closely together, added to the spiritual guidance with which they were blessed. After the newcomers arrived, arrangements were soon made for their temporary employment. Public works were established on the temple block, 555 including shops for carpenters, blacksmiths, machinists, and others. In this way many received their first start in life in Utah. Thus, through their co-operation and neighborliness, they grew in understanding, unselfishness, benevolence, and brotherly love. Work Meeting  Sewing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting) Lesson 2 The Use of Tools and Treatment of Materials Work Meeting Committee, Velma N. Simonsen, Chairman For Tuesday November 12, 1946 Textbook Reference: The Complete Book of Sewing, Chapter III Treatment of Fabrics NEARLY all types of material need some preparation before cutting out a garment. This includes woolens, cottons, linens, silk, and rayons. Reputable companies usually label their materials so that the purchaser may be sure of the kind of treatment, if any, that may be required. Unless otherwise specified, all cottons should be shrunk before cutting. If the cloth is colorfast, shrink it in hot water in order that the fibers of the material may be thoroughly penetrated, For a complete soaking, it is advisable to leave the material in the water all night, if possible. If you wish to retain the new look of the fabric, do not unfold it during the shrinking process, and press it while it is still damp. Stretch the selvage before pressing the center of the material, and iron it lengthwise. Woolens, unless they are to be tubbed, can be successfully treated by pressing with a steam iron, or they may be shrunk according to the instructions given on page 30 of The Complete Book of Sewing. Always clip the selvage and press the cloth lengthwise. Silks and rayons, if they are to be dry-cleaned, need not be shrunk, but, if they are to be tubbed, they should be shrunk. The same method used for cottons can be applied for silks and rayons, except that cooler water should be used. A small amount of vinegar or water softener may be added to the water. Use of Tools Before you start any sewing, be sure that everything you will need 556 for your work is assembled in a large workbox. Never start working without the right tools and all necessary supplies. Use good tools. Have on hand a supply of needles in sizes 1-12 for handwork, and 00-4 for sewing machines. After a little experience, you will realize the importance of selecting the correct size in both needles and thread for various types of fabrics. The professional seamstress strictly obeys this rule. Make a practice of using dressmaker's pins. These pins are sharp and do not mar the fabric. Keep them in a box by themselves, and do not use them for other purposes. Many people believe that they cannot sew with a thimble. It is impossible to sew successfully without a thimble. Select one that fits perfectly, but do not attempt to sew with it while it seems awkward and in the way. It requires days to become accustomed even to a new ring. The thimble presents an even more difficult problem. Put the thimble on the correct finger and wear it for several hours each   day until it is no longer an annoyance. Then begin to sew. It is necessary to become well acquainted with all the parts of the sewing machine. Know the purpose of each part and how it works. For this purpose it is advisable to secure from the maker of your particular sewing machine a book of instructions. Refer to this book when difficulties arise. Never tur any of the screws on your sewing machine unless you know what you are doing. Keep the machine well-oiled and in good condition. A dress will have a homemade, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE AUGUST 1946 clumsy look if the fine pin fitting of the garment has been destroyed in pressing. After a garment has been fitted to the curves of the body, if it is pressed on a straight board, the curved portions will be pressed out flat. Therefore, the curved portions should be pressed on a curved cushion. This type of cushion is very easy to make, and you will find it one of your most necessary tools for the well-turned seam, especially in the pressing of the sleeves. How to Make a Curved Cushion for Pressing Take two circular pieces of muslin, 12 inches in diameter, and sew them together with a % inch seam, leaving a small opening for the insertion of wadding. 'Turn the material inside out so that the seam is on the inside, and fill it solidly with woolen batting or chipped woolen scraps, such as woolen underwear. It is not advisable to use cotton for this purpose, since cotton batting has a tendency to wad and become lumpy. After the cushion has been stuffed, close the opening by stitching it carefully. Assignment for the instructor: Bring materials and be prepared to demonstrate steam iron and sheet shrinkage of woolens. Assignments for sewing class members: The sewing instructor should make all assignments one week before the lesson is to be given. For the November lesson, the sisters should each bring two circular pieces of muslin, twelve inches in diameter, and the stuffing for making the curved cushion. Assignment for December: Bring to the sewing meeting a tape measure and sufficient shrunk material for making one garment. LESSON DEPARTMENT 557 Revealed in Its Literature Lesson 2 Colonial Founders of America in Literature Elder Howard R. Driggs For Tuesday, November 19, 1946 discovery, exploration, colonization are the first three steps in the epic of America's making. For the Latter-day Saints, the intriguing story reaches back to the days of Jared and Zarahemla, and down through the time of Lehi and his sons on their voyage to this goodly land for settlement and develop-. Ment. For other folk the beginning ~ of the epic is in the legends of the Viking, Lief the Lucky, who, it seems historically certain, found the shores of America about the year 1000 A. D., and remained with his followers for a brief period in a region they called Vineland. Then follows a lapse of nearly five hundred years before the land was rediscovered, as a "New World." Columbus, who believed as we do, that he was inspired by the Lord, piloted with dauntless courage the way across the fearsome Atlantic. In a stirring poem named for the great discoverer, Joaquin Miller makes one feel the heroic spirit and the vision of Columbus. Following are excerpts from this American lyric: Behind him lay the gray Azores, Behind the Gates of Hercules; Before him not the ghost of shores, Before him only shoreless seas. The good mate said: '"'Now must we pray, For lo! The very stars are gone. Brave Admiral, speak, what shall I say?" "Why, say, 'Sail on! Sail on! And on!' " Then, pale and worn, he paced the deck, And peered through darkness. Ah, that night Of all dark nights! And then a speck  A light! A light! At last a light! It grew, a starlit flag unfurled! It grew to be Time's burst of dawn. He gained a world; he gave that world Its grandest lesson: "On! Sail on!" Another poet who, with soul lifting lines, has portrayed the spirit, the achievement, and nobility of Columbus, is Tennyson. In his poem of that title, the hero is pictured in chains, recounting to a friend high lights of his own life story. Following are typical lines: Chains for the Admiral of the Ocean! Chains For him who gave a new heaven, a new earth, As holy John had prophesied to me.... Who push'd his prows into the setting sun, And made West East.... Were you at Salamanca? No. We fronted there the learning of all Spain.... No guess-work! I was certain of my goal; Some thought it heresy.... Against God's word. Thus was I beaten back, And chiefly to my sorrow by the Church, And thought to tum my face from Spain,... But our Queen Recalled me, for at last their Highnesses Were half-assured this earth might be a sphere. All glory to the all-blessed Trinity, All glory to the mother of our Lord,... I have accomplish'd what I came to do. One thing that stands out in the story of Columbus is his attributing to divinity first honor for the achievement that marks his name. The isle on which he first set foot in the New World was named San Salvador (Holy Savior). With the banner of Spain as emblem of possession of the discovered realm, was planted the cross of Christ as a symbol of dedication of the domain to God. Religion has been the potent force that has held America thus far true to its course. Though lure of gold, desire for land, adventure, brought many to the New World, yet only love of God, expressed through active goodness, has permitted them to carry forward in the constructive development of America. This, we know, is in accord with divine promise made by American prophets long before Columbus or Lief the Lucky. In essence, they have said that this land is consecrated to God, and that it shall be a land of liberty so long as those possessing it shall serve him and keep his commandments (see II Nephi 1:5,7,8; also Ether 2:8-12). Our own part of America was settled largely by varied groups of people seeking a place where they might worship the Lord in peace. Thus came Protestants of different creeds, and Catholics to establish their communities or colonies. Among these God-fearing folk were the Pilgrims, justly extolled in the following poem. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE AUGUST 1946 LANDING OF THE PILGRIM FATHERS The breaking waves dashed high On the stern and rockbound coast, And the woods against a stormy sky, Their giant branches tossed; And the heavy night hung dark The hills and waters o'er, When a band of exiles moored their bark On a wild New England shore. S * Amidst the storm they sang, And the stars heard, and the sea; And the sounding aisles of the dim woods rang To the anthem of the free!  There were men with hoary hair Amidst that pilgrim band; Why had they come to wither there, Away from their childhood's land? There was woman's fearless eye, Lit by her deep love's truth; There was manhood's brow, serenely high, And the fiery heart of youth. What sought they thus afar? Bright jewels of the mine? The wealth of seas, the spoils of war? They sought a faith's pure. Shrine. Aye, call it holy ground, The soil where first they trod! They have left unstained what there they found  Freedom to worship God!  Felicia Dorothea Hemans. Keeping this key thought clearly in mind that true Americanism is rooted in Christian religion and that our liberties are predicated on acting concertedly to keep in the path of God's righteousness let us follow through this study of colonial founders of America. Since time will not permit taking up every one of these groups of freedom seekers, attention will be mainly centered on three leading ones. LESSON DEPARTMENT Old Virginia, to begin with, was first among the English-American colonies. In 1607, under charter which provided among other things for the extending of the principles of English freedom, a band of adventurers sailed in three ships into Chesapeake Bay and up the James River for a short distance. A convincing, if somewhat melodramatic, portrayal of these old days in Virginia, may be found in To Have and To Hold, by Mary Johnston. Its plot is set in the incident of bringing English girls to Virginia to be purchased by the planters. Another worthy novel picturing later days in this colony is The Crossing, by Winston Churchill. There is indeed a wealth of literature poetry, fiction, oratory, which helps to bring the events and characters of the "Old Dominion," as the colony was sometimes called, vividly to us. At first glance, it might seem that there was little of religion connected with its founding and development. This, however, is far from true. Days of "the starving time," brought the adventurers, it would seem, to their knees. When Lord Baltimore with his relief ships sailed to the succor of the colony, he was hailed, it is said, "with chastened joy, and with the cry, 'It is the Lord of Hosts: God will raise our state and build his church in this excellent clime!'" Within this growing colony, the great son of Virginia, George Washington, was reared. With a Godfearing mother, and with religious influences about him, be became the Father of our Country. Though not a man of letters, he has left many precious words of counsel that re- 559 veal his truly religious spirit among them these: A good moral character is the first essential in man. It is our duty to make the best of our misfortunes. True religion affords government its surest support. Another thing, besides its return to and cultivation of religion, marks the colony of Virginia as a soundly American commonwealth. This is the continuing fight of its patriot leaders for the fundamental principles of liberty. Though its settlers, at first, were largely of aristocratic type, and though it did not, in the beginning, permit religious liberty, there gradually rose defenders of freedom. In 1676, Nathaniel Bacon led a successful revolt against the King-appointed tyrant, Governor Berkeley, but the patriot died in the midst of victory. Others succeeded Bacon only to die as martyrs for liberty. Out of their spirit, one hundred years later, other Virginians rose to play brilliant roles in our war for freedom. - In 1620, thirteen years after the first colonists had come to Virginia, another group of English folk landed at Plymouth Rock, on the shore of what soon was to become Massachusetts. Simple, God-fearing folk were these Pilgrims, seeking a haven where they could work and worship together in peace. In solemn agreement, made on board the ship that had borne them across the stormy Atlantic, they stated clearly their purpose, and covenanted before God to co-operate in framing "just and 560 equal laws" such as were deemed "for the general good of the colony" and promised obedience to these laws, enacted of their own free will and choice in their new homeland. This "Mayflower Compact" (see page 565) plainly set forth the basic principles of true Americanism. With its acceptance by these plain, honest folk, the cornerstone of our nation was laid. It was a dedication under God to the American way of life. To keep that pact, even now, is to assure us all of freedom in a realm consecrated to righteousness. A wealth of literature has been created around these Pilgrims and around another group of freedom seekers, the Massachusetts Bay Colony, who came ten years later to settle in the region where Boston, and nearby communities were developed. Some of these creations, doubtless read by many during school days, will yield new riches with rereading now to bring old colonial days, in thought, customs, and wholesome drama, closer to us. No finer picture of the Pilgrims has. Been given than Longfellow's poetic symphony "The Courtship of Miles Standish." Through its musical and artistic lines one feels the spirit of those earnest, God-fearing folk, sees them at work and worship, meets their serious problems, and realizes their fine courage and faith, their devotion to the Lord. Just a few excerpts here from the classic poem for illustration. These from the scenes of the return sailing of the Mayflower. John Alden, after his soul-searching experience with Priscilla and Miles Standish, is pictured as he: RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE AUGUST 1946 Joined in the morning prayer, and in the treading of Scripture, And, with the others, in haste went hurrying down to the sea-shore, Down to the Plymouth Rock, that had been to their feet as a doorstep Into a world unknown the comer-stone of a nation! He had resolved to go back with the ship, to forget his troubles: But as he gazed on the crowd, he beheld the form of Priscilla Standing dejected among them, unconscious of all that was passing. Suddenly his resolve changed and within himself he said: "Here I remain!... Yes, as my foot was the first that stepped on this rock at the landing, So, with the blessing of God, shall it be the last at the leaving!" Meanwhile the Master, alert, but with dignified air and important,... Walked about on the sands, and people crowded around him Saying a few last words, and enforcing his careful remembrance. Then, taking each by the hand, as if he were grasping a tiller, Into the boat he sprang, and in haste shoved off to his vessel, Glad in his heart to get rid of all this worry and flurry, Glad to be gone from a land of sand and sickness and sorrow, Short allowance of victual, and plenty of nothing but Gospel! Lost in the sound of the oars was the last farewell of the Pilgrims. O strong hearts and true! Not one went back in the Mayflower! the Long in silence they watched the receding sail of the vessel,... Then, as if filled with the spirit, and wrapt in a vision prophetic, Baring his hoary head, the excellent Elder of Plymouth Said, "Let us pray!" and they prayed, and thanked the Lord and took courage  LESSON DEPARTMENT So they returned to their homes; but Alden lingered a little, Musing alone on the shore, and watching the wash of the billows Round the base of the rock, and the sparkle and flash of the sunshine, Like the spirit of God, moving visibly over the waters. * e Ge Thinking of many things, and most of all of Priscilla;... Lo! As he turned to depart, Priscilla was standing beside him. Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter, portraying stern Puritanism, is another classic story. In "Mabel Martin," by Whittier, we have echoes of old witchcraft days. Another of his poems, "Snowbound," is an artistic portrayal of the wholesome family life of old New England. For bits of humor with colonial flavor yes, critics to the contrary notwithstanding, the Puritans did get some good fun out of living we may turn to such selections as "The Wonderful One Hoss Shay," by Holmes, "The Courtin'," by Lowell, or "The Pine Tree Shillings," by Hawthorne. A few excerpts, from the story last named, will serve here to illustrate this earlier day humor. Captain John Hull be it said for introduction  as mint-master of the colony, had by melting up battered silverware of all sorts, and transforming it into bright pine-tree shillings, and taking his honest toll for the service, made himself rich. Then came Samuel Sewell, a "personable young man," of. Good habits, and "a member of the church," courting the mint-master's only daughter, who is called Betsy. In describing her, the author says that she was "'by no means so slender as some young ladies in our own days. On the contrary, having always fed heartily on pumpkin pies, doughnuts, Indian puddings, and other Puritan dainties, she was as round and plump as a pudding herself." 561 To young Samuel, when he asked for her hand, the father said in his rough way, "Yes, you may take her; and you'll find her heavy burden enough...." On the wedding day we may suppose that honest John Hull dressed himself in a plum-colored coat, all the buttons of which were made of pine-tree shillings.... Thus attired he sat with great dignity in his armchair; and being a portly old gentleman, he completely filled it from elbow to elbow. On the opposite side of the room, between her bridesmaids, sat Miss Betsy. She was blushing with all her might, and looked like a full-blown peony or a big red apple. The mint-master was pleased with his new son-in-law, especially as he had courted her out of pure love, and had said nothing at all about her marriage portion, or dowry. So when the marriage ceremony was over, he whispered a word to two of his menservants, who immediately went out, and soon returned, lugging in a large pair of scales. They were such a pair as merchants use for weighing bulky commodities; and quite a bulky commodity was now to be weighed in them. "Daughter Betsy," said the mint-master, "get into one side of these scales." Miss Betsy or Mrs. Sewell, as we must call her did as she was bid, like a dutiful child.... But what her father could mean, unless to make her husband pay for her by the pound (in which case she would have been a dear bargain) she had not the least idea. "And now," said honest John Hull... "bring that box hither." The huge box was tugged across the floor. Unlocked by the father, it was found "full to the brim of bright pine-tree shillings." At the Captain's command, the servants heaped these, handful after handful, into one side of the scales, on the other side of which stood the bride. Finally, "plump and ponderous as she was, they fairly weighed the young lady from the floor." "There, son Sewell!" cried the honest mint-master, "take those shillings for my daughter's portion. Use her kindly and thank Heaven for her. It is not every wife that is worth her weight in silver." From Grandfather's Chair, by Hawthorne. 562 ~ Appreciative rereading of some of these classic selections will bring clearer pictures of colonial New England. The pictures were drawn when their creators were closer to that life. Better acquaintance with the earlier portrayals will also enhance the reading of more modern creations dealing with the same general materials and themes. In Western Star, by the late gifted poet, Stephen Vincent Benet, will be found a realistic and appreciative portrayal of modern cast, of the early Virginia colonists and the Pilgrims. This is a theme that has attracted authors of America through the years. It was in 1683 that Penn, on the good ship, Welcome, sailed up the Delaware River to join the people of his chosen faith who had preceded him to America. In response to the welcome that greeted him he said simply: "You shall be governed by laws of your own making, and live a free, and if you will, a sober and industrious people." On the banks of the Delaware, he laid out Philadelphia, the "City of Brotherly Love." A legislature appointed by the people was to make all the laws. There was to be no religious intolerance; those of every faith were welcomed. No tax could be levied, save by law. All that was required of freemen to vote and hold office was that they believe in God and keep his Sabbath day holy. Every child was to be taught some useful trade. Penn's peaceful policy in dealing with the red men is proverbial. Under a spreading elm at Shackamaxon, he met with their elders. "The RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE AUGUST 1946 friendship between you and me," he said to them, "I will not compare with a chain; for that the rains might rust.. We are all one flesh and blood."   Touched by the white leader's kindliness and sincerity, the Indians responded, "We will live in love with William Penn and his children as long as the sun and moon shall shine." On strings of wampum they kept record of the treaty, and would often rehearse its provisions. It is said to be the one and only treaty that was never sworn to, and never broken, Latter-day Saints will appreciate this story, for the policy adopted by President Young with the Indians of the West was in spirit and actions closely akin to that of William Penn. For a clearer view of old Philadelphia by one who knew it intimately, one should read The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin. As a boy in severe Boston, he sighed for a place more genial and friendly; and he found just this in the "City of Brotherly Love." His story of the trip he made there by working his passage on a boat through Long Island Sound, and afoot across New Jersey, again by boat down the Delaware until he came to the "quaint old Quaker town," and of the first days he spent there, are classic. Through his life story, much of it in this Philadelphia setting, one may get clear, convincing pictures of old colonial days. There is no better firsthand book dealing with those times. John Greenleaf Whittier, himself a Quaker, also brings us close to the heart of the followers of William Penn, Here are a few stanzas from LESSON DEPARTMENT a poem in which he pays tribute to these simple, God-fearing folk: The Quaker of the olden time! How calm and firm and true, Unspotted by its wrong and crime, He walked the dark earth. Through. He walked by faith and not by sight, By love and not by law; The presence of the wrong or right He rather felt than saw. He felt that wrong with wrong partakes, That nothing stands alone, That whoso gives the motive, makes His brother's sin his own. * *& * O Spirit of that early day, So pure and strong and true, Be with us in the narrow way Our faithful fathers knew. Necessary limits to this study preclude more than passing tribute to the other liberty-fostering colonies of our America. Each of these, picturesque and significant in contributions to the life and progress of our country towards freedom, has its own intriguing story and wealth of literature. In New York, formerly New Amsterdam, it was the sturdy Dutch who first made settlements. Popular portrayals in humorous, yet appreciative vein, by Irving, have given us entertainment through the years. We must read between the lines, however, of Rip Van Winkle and the Legend of Sleepy Hollow, to get at the true, thrifty, hardworking folk he playfully portrays. To the Dutch, America owes much for their promotion of free schools, their religious tolerance, their unwavering support of fundamental principles of free government. As one poet has written: 563 Yet deem them not for ridicule a theme, These worthy burghers and their spouses kind, Scorning of heartless pomp, the gilded dream, To deeds of peaceful industry inclined, In hospitality sincere and grave, Inflexible in truth, in simple virtue brave.  Mrs. Sigourney Maryland, settled by the persecuted Catholics, is another colony deserving of more extended study than can be given here. Under Lord Baltimore, who founded this haven for an oppressed people, two ships, the Ark and the Dove, sailed into Chesapeake Bay in 1629, and planted the city that bears this leader's name. Its charter gave to all freemen voice in making the laws. All sects were to be tolerated; and there was to be no taxing by England. Another group of religious refugees, the Huguenots from France, found a new home on the shores of America particularly in the Carolinas. They brought not only new fruits and flowers to that sunny clime, but also the refinements of their old French homeland, and withal they carried industry, charity, and morality, and love of freedom with them. Puritan intolerance was largely responsible for the founding of another colony of truly American spirit. Roger Williams, insistent on freedom of conscience in his worship, was made so uncomfortable in Massachusetts, that he finally left for the wilds and found welcome with the Narraganset Indians. Red men, be it said, seem not to have made differences in religion a bar to their hospitality. In essence, the story of many other colonies is of like spirit and purpose, planned as a haven of refuge. Georgia, founded by General Oglethorpe, was a refuge for freed debtors; New Jersey, a harbor for those who were largely of Episcopalian faith; Connecticut, like Rhode Island, became a homeland for many who left Massachusetts as followers of Thomas Hooker, and also of Anne Hutchinson, because they protested against the strictures of Puritan leadership.
Freedom of worship, freedom to share in the responsibilities of their own governing, freedom under self-made laws, were the fundamentals for these colonial builders of early America. In all the literature that truly voices the heart of these varied groups of earnest folk, this love of liberty�orderly liberty�is expressed. It was that for which they sought a home in the New World, for which they endured hardships and dangers. For this precious boon they lived; and for it they were ready to give their all.
Discussion and Activities
1. On what passages of scripture is this promise based: America shall be a land of liberty only so long as its people keep the commandments of God?
2. What are evidences that help
justify our belief that Columbus was inspired of the Lord in his discovery of the New World? (See 1 Nephi 13:12-13.)
3. Give the legend of Pocahontas and John Smith.
4. Select some lines from a poem, novel, short story, oration or other type of literature portraying colonial life, character, or ideals; and be prepared to read it aloud for others of the class.
5. Be ready, under the direction of the this leader, to present a series of excerpts from "The Courtship of Miles Standish," which will give, in condensed form, that story of the Pilgrims, with emphasis on the truly American ideals they exemplified.

Edgar Lyon For Tuesday, November 19, 1946 S pointed out in the lesson *" last month, one great principle which we struggled to maintain in the pre-existence was that of individual free agency. As a necessary step for the utilization of this principle, the earth was created and we were given mortal existence. Earth life thus became, in reality, a laboratory in which mortals were to | exercise the gift of free agency in the choice of good and evil. We believed in this plan so intently that we accepted the responsibility of earth life without any guarantee of our ultimate exaltation. It was a time "when the morning stars sang together, and the sons of God shouted for joy" (Job 38:7). Mankind was thus placed upon the earth to pass through a period of apprenticeship that would be a preparation for the next step in eternal progression. Certain things were expected of those who accepted mortality. First, obedience to the commandments of God was anticipated. And one that was like unto God had said, "And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them" (Abraham 3:25). From this scripture it is evident that obedience to divine law is the first requirement for readmittance into the presence of God, but it is merely the minimum requirement.   A second obligation in connection with the use of free agency and its exercise is that of taking the initiative to do more than give mere obedience to specific commandments. The Lord has instructed us to watch for opportunities to render service to others and assume the responsibility of taking the initiative in such matters. For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward. Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness; For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And _ inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward. But he that doeth not anything until he is commanded and receiveth a commandment with doubtful heart, and keepeth it with slothfulness, the same is damned... (Doc. And Cov. 58:26-29). This scripture is positive in its teaching that the Lord requires us to do more than merely observe commandments. We must be prepared to go "the second mile" (Matt. 5:41). There is a third item that needs to be observed in connection with LESSON DEPARTMENT our earthly probation. It is the attitude of mind that we should have toward life itself and the problems that present themselves in the course of life. Instead of viewing life as a mournful burden to be tolerated but not enjoyed, God would have us take an optimistic view of life, and rejoice in the process of seeking salvation. The Book of Mormon prophet, Jacob, expressed this idea as follows: Therefore, cheer up your hearts, and remember that ye are free to act for yourselves to choose the way of everlasting death or the way of eternal life (II Nephi 10:23). In this dispensation the Lord reiterated this doctrine through the Prophet Joseph Smith. In speaking of observing the Lord's day and other religious requirements, the revelation reads in part, "... Do these things with thanksgiving, with cheerful hearts and countenances..." (Doc. And Cov. 59:15). A fourth obligation of free agents who have accepted the gospel is to be diligent in the use of their agency for the welfare of the Church. Although the Lord has placed inspired leadership at the head of the Church, there is also a strong element of democracy in it. Ordinations to the Priesthood, selection of officers, and other functions demand that the inspired nominations by the appointed leaders be ratified or rejected by the membership. It is a fundamental teaching of the Lord to the Church that "And all things shall be done by common consent in the Church.. 2" (Doc and Cov. 26:2; see also 28:13). This teaching demands that each free agent 567 exercise his agency in the sustaining or rejecting of these propositions. One of our latter-day prophets, John Taylor, had very positive opinions concerning the use of his agency. He viewed it not only as a God-given blessing, but also as something that he was required to use to the best of his ability. The following quotation is indicative of his attitude: I have felt very decided... Ever since I could comprehend anything; that I would worship God as I pleased, without anybody's dictation, and that I would dictate to no man his faith, neither should any man dictate to me my faith... (B. H. Roberts, Life of John Taylor, pp. 422, 423). From the foregoing scriptural quotations and observations, it is apparent that the free agency of man is a divine principle. Furthermore, it places on mankind a tremendous responsibility for all human conduct. Few of us seem to fully sense either the true value of agency or our responsibility to make an intelligent use of it. In his letter to the saints at Rome, the apostle Paul defined the gospel of Christ as "... The power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth..." (Rom. 1:16). Brigham Young stated this idea with great clarity when he said: The Gospel of the Son of God that has been revealed is a plan or system of laws and ordinances, by strict obedience to which the people who inhabit this earth are assured that they may return again into the presence of the Father and the Son (Discourses of Brigham Young, page 1). These statements indicate that there are two elements in the gospel one is the saving power of 568 God, the other is the effort that people put forth to make their lives conform to God's Prescribed way of living, A thoughtful reading of the scriptures indicates that Christ was not teaching a mere system of belief. His message demanded action. Recall the parables of the good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37); the prodigal son (Luke 1511-32); the lost sheep (Luke 15:3-7); and the lost coin (Luke 15:8-10); and many others. Each parable demonstrates that Work is required of the true Christan. The man who fell among thieves on the Jericho road was not helped until the Samaritan rendered service. The Prodigal son was not benefited until he made the decision to return to his father. The lost sheep was not found until the shepherd went after it. The lost coin was recovered only after the woman swept the house and sought diligently for it. One of the frequent admonitions of Jesus, at the conclusion of a parable or illustration was, "Go, and do thou likewise" (Luke 10:37), The gospel of Christ is thus, in reality, a Way of living and acting, instead of just a way Of believing. The goal of mortal existence is to struggle upward through obedience to God's commands, the rendering of service, and belief in God and Christ, to a state of exaltation. Jesus had this in mind when he said, "Be ve therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect (Matt. 5:48). We its fulness. It was not until after the atonement of RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE AUGUST 1946 Jesus was completed, that the gospel plan was finally consummated. It is for this reason that we should fee] especially blessed to be allowed to come to earth in this, the dispensation of the fulness of times, when the knowledge of all former gospel ages has been revealed to us. "If you are relaxation, and ease, to say nothing earth." He probably thought he was witty, but he really spoke the truth. Some of the most appealing teachings of the Restored Church are those of never-ending development, opportunity for creative activity, and Progression toward a state of godhood. Many people, however, view these interesting ideals as things that are to be confined to the hereafter. The true interpretation that the gospel teaches us, however, is that today and yesterday are just as much a part of eternity as any day that is to come. This concept, if properly understood, should stimulate each Church member, each day, to make the most of his opportunities for Progress, service, and development. In discussing this interpretation, Brigham Young said:  and destroy yourselves, if you - + + I do not believe that the Lord delights in people who wish to die before they have accomplished the work that he designed for them to do... Instead of Preparing to die, Prepare to live in the midst of all the exaltations of the Gods. We are organized for the ex. LESSON DEPARTMENT press purpose of controlling the elements, of organizing and disorganizing, of ruling over kingdoms, principalities, and powers, and yet our affections are often too highly placed upon paltry, perishable objects. We love houses, gold, silver, and various kinds of property, and all who unduly prize any object there is beneath the celestial world are idolators. (Discourses of Brigham Young, pp. 135, 136, 137; 1941 Ed. Pp. 88, 89, go). President Joseph F. Smith aptly said: Some people dream... And teach that all the glory they ever expect to have in the world to come is to sit in the light and glory of the Son of God, and sing praises and songs of joy and gratitude all their immortal lives. We do not believe in any such things. We believe that every man will have his work to do in the other world, just as surely as he had it to do here, and a greater work than he can do here. We believe that we are on the road of advancement, of development in knowledge, in understanding, and in every good thing, and that we will continue to grow, advance, and develop throughout the eternities that are before us (Gospel Doctrine, page 453). The ultimate goal that we hope to achieve is the blessed state described in the Doctrine and Covenants. They are they who are priests and kings, who have received of his fulness. And of his glory; and are priests of the Most High, after the order of Melchizedek, which was after the order of Enoch, which was after the order of the Only Begotten Son. Wherefore, as it is written, they are gods, even the sons of God'? (Doc. And Cov. 76:56-58). 569 Then shall they be gods, because they have no end; therefore shall they be from everlasting to everlasting, because they continue; then shall they be above all, because all things are subject unto them. Then shall they be gods, because they have all power, and the angels are subject unto them (Doc. And Cov. 132:20). Discussion and Activity Problems 1. Why is it a good thing that our memory of the pre-existent state is taken from us during mortality?. What is required beyond obedience to the specific commandments of the gospel?. What do we mean when we say that the gospel is eternal? 4. Why do. You suppose the Latter-day Saints teach that heaven is a place of continued activity rather than a place of rest? 5- Have a class member read the words of song No. 37 in L. DS. Hymns, "Know This, that Every Soul Is Free." 6. If the lesson is properly presented, the sisters should be stimulated by its central thoughts to express their gratitude, during the discussion, for their agency and their hope for exaltation in the life to come.

Jacobs, Chairman For Tuesday, November 26, Lesson Link: 1946 In the previous lesson we considered the eternal nature of the family unit. We discussed briefly the pre-existence as the first stage of human development, then stressed the importance of mortality as a proving ground. We learned that marriage is ordained of God and is to be in effect throughout eternity. We shall now consider the practical workings of the family unit, the qualities that are essential for harmonious and successful family life, and the responsibilities of the various members of the family for the welfare of the whole. IN general conference of April 1945, President David O. McKay delivered a forceful address on the subject "Marriage and Divorce" (see Improvement Era for May 1945). He pointed out that "... Marriage is ordained of God unto man" and that, through having offspring, man enables the earth to "answer the end of its creation; And that it might be filled with the measure of man, according to his creation before the world was made" (Doc. And Cov. 49:15-17). President McKay states that: Marriage is a sacred relationship entered into for purposes that are well recognized primarily for the rearing of a family. To look upon marriage as a mere contract that may be entered into at pleasure in response to a romantic whim, or for selfish purposes, and severed at the first difficulty or misunderstanding that may arise, is an evil meriting severe condemnation, especially in cases wherein children are made to suffer because of such separation. With such a lofty and serious concept, how can Latter-day Saint husbands and wives have other than the deepest respect for the marital bonds? It is a wise providence that provides two parents in a_ family. "Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord" (I Cor. 11:11). One parent cannot say to the other, "My place is more important than yours." Latter-day Saints believe in the equality of the sexes, each in its own sphere. Woman is not considered inferior to man but only different in make-up, as he, in his way, is different from woman. The proper rearing of children is so complex and important that it requires the loving co-operation of both a father and a mother to do it full justice. Moreover, the father and mother, in their divergent personalities, backgrounds, and accomplishments, complement and strengthen each other, and thus build solidarity into the home. When it becomes necessary for one parent to assume the responsibilities of both, there occurs a gap which can never be entirely filled. In general, the responsibility of the father in the home is that of providing sustenance for the family and that of the mother is the bearing LESSON DEPARTMENT and rearing of children. He js fitted by nature to be the protector and leader, while the capabilities of Yet in all important matters, the judgment and influence of both are True Latter-day Saints believe in having large families. It could not be otherwise when we consider that God's first command to man, after his creation, was to multiply and replenish the earth. That admonition is as binding today as it was to our first Parents in the Garden of Eden. President George Albert Smith has said, "it was in the plan of our Heavenly Father that every living thing that he created should reproduce after its kind." Children are Priceless treasures. No greater joy can come to mortals than that experienced through bringing spirits into the world and rearing them accord. Mg to righteous Principles. "Ag allows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth. Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them..." (Psalms 127:4-5), Opportunities for development in a family of several children are greater than in a small family. The associations in large families tend to develop qualities of character and disposition that make for genuine success and happiness. And take" children to live more harmoniously with those both within fines of the home. An authority on child welfare has said that an only child has a twenty per cent handicap 577 in marriage, because he has less chance of making a satisfactory adjustment than 4 child who has brothers and sisters, Attributes of Parents Parents, first of all, must love each other dearly and should exhibit love and tenderness toward each other. Affection between Parents is not a thing of which to be ashamed, yet some parents seem embarrassed to display their affection before the children. This makes it appear an unnatural demonstration, Affection among members of the family is beautiful and refining. How can children be expected to exhibit love and tenderness toward Parents and toward each other if the parents themselves do not set the example? For one Parent to criticize or make disparaging remarks about the other is disastrous to the unity of the family, Children are embarrassed when this occurs. The oneness of the family is questioned. Hey may even take sides with one or the other parent or become disillusioned in both. Parents should uphold the decisions of each other before the children and always present a united front. If mother says "No," father should not say "Yes." For example: If father has told Peter he cannot go to scout meeting until the lawn is cut, mother should not allow him to go before the task is completed. F mother is disciplining Alice for, father should not sympathize and tell her to come out before the time is up. Parents must try to see each other's viewpoint and respect each other�s 572 opinions even though they may differ. The fact that Mr. And Mrs. Brown have different views on the advisability of buying a car, or sending Johnny to college, or taking a vacation, does not necessarily mean that they are at loggerheads with each other. Pros and cons can be discussed amicably until a united decision is reached. It is not a sign of weakness to give in or to change one's mind in fact, many times it is a sign of courage or unselfishness. And, when an agreement is reached on any problem, both parents should stand by that decision. With no feeling of resentment or animosity. Father's Place and Responsibility in the Home The father is the recognized head of the family, the bearer of the Priesthood. There is no higher authority in matters relating to the family organization, and especially when that organization is presided over by one holding the higher Priesthood, than that of the father. The authority is time honored, and among the people of God in all dispensations it has been highly respected and often emphasized by the teachings of the prophets who were inspired of God. The patriarchal order is of divine origin and will continue throughout time and eternity..... Wives and children should be taught to feel that the patriarchal order in the kingdom of God has been established for a wise and beneficent purpose, and should sustain the head of the household and encourage him in the discharge of his duties, and do all in their power to aid him in the exercise of the rights and privileges which God has bestowed upon the head of the home.... It is not merely a question of who is perhaps the best qualified.. Neither is it wholly a question of who is living the most worthy life. It is a question largely of law and order... (Gospel Doctrine, pp. 359, 360). RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE AUGUST 1946 When the Priesthood is magnified by the father, the entire family may receive its blessings and inspiration. It is the privilege of the father to exercise the Priesthood in the administration of the sick in his home and to unite his faith with members of the family for the restoration of health. When others are called in to assist in this ordinance, it is the father's place to preside. A father should take pride and joy in blessing and naming his children, in baptizing and confirming them members of the Church, and in taking part in ordinations to the Priesthood of members of the family. It is his responsibility to preside at the table, at family prayers, and in giving general direction to the family. He should be a worthy example in attending to Church duties and in all matters of conduct. It is the responsibility of the father to provide an adequate living for his family. This means food and clothing sufficient for health and self-respect, a respectable home, medical attention, and some provision for wholesome recreation. It is not wise to give to children all the things they wish. President Joseph F. Smith says of this: When indulgent parents fancy that they are adding to the pleasure of their children's lives by giving to them whatever they wish, such parents are in fact destroying the capacity of their children to enjoy the gratification of desires weakened and perverted by over-indulgence. The ability to give to children wisely is indeed a rare attainment, and is acquired only by a thoughtful and prudent exercise of the highest sense of duty which parents can feel for their children. Duty is always preferable to indulgence (Gospel Doctrine, page 373). LESSON DEPARTMENT A father should be a companion to his wife and children. Recreation and amusement should be planned whereby the family may associate together and enjoy each other's company. A father who enjoys playing games with the children, going on hikes and excursions, usually keeps close to his children. There are few circumstances under which family members learn to love and appreciate each other more than when they play together. At such times there is an excellent opportunity to teach children some of the great lessons of life, without their being aware of it without preachment. Occasions arise when fair play, truthfulness, courtesy, fulfilling one's word, cooperation, and many other sterling qualities may be firmly implanted in their lives. Mother's Responsibility in the Home Motherhood is a sublime calling. No public career contributes as much to humanity as does the successful rearing of children. Brigham Young said, ""The mothers are the moving instruments in the hands of Providence to guide the destinies of nations." A mother should first of all uphold her husband as head of the family and in all righteous endeavors. If she sets the example in upholding him, the children will naturally follow her example. She should sustain him in all his Church duties, be proud of his work in the things of God, and encourage and assist him to faithfully fulfill his obligations. Latter-day saint wives enjoy a privilege of which other women know nothing; the heads of their 573 households are men holding the Priesthood of God. Sister Augusta Winters Grant, wife of President Heber J. Grant, said, in an article in The Relief Society Magazine: As a Latter-day Saint wife I honor my husband as a man holding the Priesthood. It is my firm conviction that if the women of our Church would rely unfalteringly upon the inspiration of their husbands, in all important matters concerning their family affairs, they would find that their husbands would grow in the power of discernment and decision through the exercise of their Priesthood (Relief Society Magazine, Nov. 1936, page 671). Not only is motherhood a divine calling, but it is a practical one as well. A mother needs skill in various fields. She must be able to prepare nutritious and appetizing meals, and to make her home attractive and comfortable a place where friends and relatives may feel the warmth of hospitality. Birthdays, anniversaries, and holidays should be made occasions of special significance and pleasure to the family. 'The mother should know the fundamentals of home nursing, that the health of her family may be safeguarded. She must know how to budget the family income wisely so that full value is received and the necessities of life provided. Brigham Young gave this definition of a woman's responsibilities: It is the calling of the wife and mother to know what to do with everything that is brought into the house, laboring to make  her home desirable to her husband and children, making herself an Eve in the midst of a little paradise of her own creating, securing her husband's love and confidence, and tying her offspring to her- 574 self, with a love that is stronger than death... (Discourses of Brigham Young, page 307; 1941 Ed., page 198). It is the duty of both parents to teach their children, from infancy, upright conduct, but this responsibility devolves upon mothers far more than upon fathers, for mothers are with their children a greater part of the time. At a mothers knee children should be taught all good habits and practices. Gospel training must not be left to the auxiliary organizations of the Church. 'They only supplement the fuller teaching children should receive in the home. Children's Responsibilities  Versus -Rights Responsibilities Children are under obligation to render respect and obedience to their parents. "Honor thy father and thy mother" is a command that will ever be in effect. Life is a great gift, and for this gift alone, children should respect and honor parents. Children should be willing to work and share with members of the family and to sacrifice, if necessary, for the welfare of any of the group. Work is a blessing and each child should have duties to perform in proportion to his age and strength. It is good for children to learn the value of money. A certain family for several years had a maid who did the housework; but after some years of service, the maid married and left their employ. At this juncture, the children of the family said, "Why cannot we do the work and earn the money she received?� RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE AUGUST 1946  The parents thought it a splendid suggestion and, since that time, the children have each assumed responsibility for certain household tasks, in return for which they have been given money for clothes and recreation. They have learned the value of money, developed skill in housekeeping, and gained a feeling of usefulness and independence. When parents become old or dependent it should be the joy, as well as the duty, of children to support and lovingly care for their parents. Rights Children have rights in the home as well as responsibilities. 'They have a right, as they grow older, to a voice in certain family decisions and problems. Sharing in family problems matures children and proves to them that they are an integral part of the family unit. They should have the privilege of inviting their friends to the home and of being assured that the friends will receive cordial treatment. President McKay has said: There are three fundamental things to which every child is entitled: (1) a respected name, (2) a sense of security, (3) opportunities for development. The family gives to the child his name and standing in the community. A child wants his family to be as good as those of his friends. He wants to be able to point with pride to his father, and to feel an inspiration always as he thinks of his mother... A child has the right to feel that in his home he has a place of refuge, a place of protection from the dangers and evils of the outside world. Family unity and integrity are necessary to supply this need. He needs parents who are happy in their adjustment to each other, who are working hopefully toward the fulfilment LESSON DEPARTMENT of an ideal of living, who love their children with a sincere and unselfish love; in short, who are well-balanced individuals, gifted with a certain amount of insight, who are able to provide the child with a wholesome emotional background which will contribute more to his development than material advantages.... No man or woman can create a true home who is not willing in the outset to embrace life heroically, to encounter labor and sacrifice. Only to such, can this divinest power be given to create on earth that which is the nearest image of heaven (Improvement Era, May 1945, Pp. 239- 314). Questions for Discussion 1. How does friction between parents affect children?. What are the advantages to children of belonging to large families? 3. How can the Priesthood be honored by the mother? 4. Why is a sense of security so important to a child? 5- Discuss the value of having children earn money. IS] 575 6. Discuss the value of family councils wherein each member may express an opinion. 7- Show that co-operation among members of a family and sacrifice for each other is essential.
