THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE THE INFINITE Grace Sayre Where day has swept her silken sails of gold The sunset sky holds brightly bannered light; Beneath the evening's fast-diminishing glow The wet sand hollows lie in saucered mold. Upon the rocky ledge here at my hand I reach to lift a star-beam from the pool Of saucered sand, and dip my finger tips To place it on a shelving rock to cool. I lift my two cupped hands, high up, to hold The star that slips through trickling sands of gold. Where does this beauty go, when tides have cleaned The star-beams from each hollowed spot of sand? Why does the tide sweep loveliness away When I have held the universe in my hand? I can but trust my world to him to hold Who made the stars, the tides, the ocean's gold. The Cover: "Silhouette of Trees" from a photograph by Grace O. Tuttle. VOL. 33, NO. 1 JANUARY 1946 GENERAL PRESIDENCY OF RELIEF SOCIETY President Belle S. Spafford, Counselors Marianne C. Sharp and Gertrude R. Garff New Year's Greetings N behalf of the General Board of Relief Society we extend love and 8) New Year's greetings to Relief Society members throughout the world, and we pray that this new year will bring them comfort, spiritual strength, and j joy. Relief Society women, like everyone else the world over, have passed through dark days during the past war years. They have had difficult and heartbreaking experiences, but they have met these experiences with a fortitude born of faith?a faith that God was at the helm directing in the affairs of men and that ultimately right would triumph over wrong. They have worked and prayed. They have been courageous in their individual lives. They have bound up the brokenhearted and have earnestly sought after peace. And the spirit of God has been upon them even as it was upon Isaiah of old when he bound up the brokenhearted. They have been given strength according to their faith as was Alma when he broke the prison cords unto deliverance. And now the new year is upon us. The mighty nations have bidden their armies to lay down their weapons of war. For this we are truly grateful and we acknowledge the goodness of our Heavenly Father. But we also know that the new year, too, will exact of us strong faith, great courage, devotion to human welfare and a continued striving for peace. 5 This is a time when we might with profit read the vision of Lehi when he beheld a rod of iron which extended along the bank of the river and led to the tree by which he stood. And the iron rod was the word of God which led to the fountain of living waters, or to the tree of life; which waters were a representation of the love of God. And many caught hold of the rod of iron but did not hold fast and were drowned in the depths of the fountain, and many loosed their hold and wandered into strange roads and were lost (I Nephi 11). Only as we cling fast to the iron rod will we be secure. As we cling fast to the word of God, the spirit of God will attend us, his love will be poured forth upon us; we will receive strength and courage according to our needs, and we shall have peace, that true inner peace, that quietness and assurance which the Prophet Isaiah told us was the work of righteousness. And our righteousness shall be a leaven unto the wickedness of the world. We shall be like a lamp that burneth in the darkness, and "Gentiles shall see our righteousness and kings our glory." The prayers of the General Board are ever with the sisters of the Relief Society whether they abide in our own or foreign lands, May we all so conduct our lives that nothing will stand between us and the blessings we seek at God's hands. Belle S. Spafford Marianne C. Sharp Gertrude R. Garff, General Presidency. Page 3 Margaret Cummock Pickering President Amy Brown Lyman MARGARET Cummock Pickering, appointed General Secretary-Treasurer of the Relief Society October 31, 1945, is well known in both the Church and the community as an untiring, efficient, and willing worker. In Church and other humanitarian Causes, and in the promotion of civic enterprise and improvements, she has given so fully of her time and talents that it has been said of her that "she majors in volunteer service." In her new and responsible calling her best effort will be put forth to carry forward the important work and other duties thus assigned to her and to maintain high standards; and she will bring to this position a wealth of knowledge and experience which will be helpful to Relief Society women in solving their practical problems. A devoted Latter-day Saint, Sister Pickering has cheerfully accepted calls made of her by the Church, and she has performed faithfully every duty and responsibility these important calls have placed upon her. While she has served in various Church Capacities, her chief work has been in connection with the Reer of the Relief Society of the South Eighteenth W. Ard, and also of the General Secretary-Treasurer at Relief Society headquarters, Her civic and community activities have been unusually varied and extensive. Because of her wide acquaintance, her Organizing ability, and her willingness to render Service, she has been an important factor in the work of many State and local agencies. She was the first executive secretary of the Woman's Civic Center, where she helped to organize and establish this worthy and helpful institution; the first secretary of the Utah State Society For Mental Hygiene; a member of the executive committee of the Community Chest, which agency she has continuously supported; and for many years she has served as a director of Robertson Cummock who accepted the gospel message in far-away Scotland and left their home to emigrate man of ability and head of the Pickering Advertising Agency. MARGARET CUMMOCK PICKERING He is a cultured, kindly gentleman, devoted to his wife and home and always ready and willing to support her in all her work and undertakings. Sister Pickering received her  education in the public schools of Salt Lake City and the Latter-day Saints College from which she was graduated. She has also taken special courses at the Utah State Agricultural College and at the University of Utah. I first met Margaret Cummock when, as a young girl, she was employed at the general headquarters of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association as office secretary, and I was serving in the headquarters of the Relief Society as General Secretary. At that time, the general offices of the Y. M. M. I. A. Were located on the south side of the second floor of the Bishop's Building, and those of the Relief Society on the north side, with only the long hall separating them. Margaret was, for a number of years, a worker in the Era office, where she very naturally became intimately associated with us Relief Society workers across the hall, and greatly interested in our work. She was in and out of our offices as we planned the publication and launched the Relief Society Bulletin in 1914, and The Relief Society Magazine in 1915. Our group of Relief Society workers at that time included, among others, Aunt Em Wells, General President, Susa Young Gates, and Jeanette A. Hyde, editor and business manager, respectively, of The Relief Society Magazine. I am sure it was during these early years of her life that Margaret learned to love, understand, and appreciate the work of the great Relief Society organization which has all through the years been so dear to her. MARGARET CUMMOCK PICKERING Margaret was fortunate in her office experience, having been assigned principally to the editorial department of the Era when she worked under the direction of that scholarly and faithful Latter-day Saint and editor, Edward H. Anderson. The work she was doing also brought her in close and frequent contact with many of the General Authorities of the Church, including President Heber J. Grant who at that time was personally supervising the financial affairs of the Era. President Grant was, therefore, a frequent caller at the Era office where he checked and examined records and reports and dictated letters. I heard him say many times in those days that no one else could please him quite so well in taking and transcribing dictation as could Margaret Cummock. This association with prominent Church workers was a fine influence in her life, and, no doubt, her knowledge of the gospel was increased and her testimony strengthened.

BS Page 6 Prize- (inning (Poems Eliza Roxey Snow Memorial Prize Poem Contest EVA WILLES WANGSGAARD First Prize Poem Star of Gold Eva Willes Wangsgaard 1 ? My neighbor's Where last year window frames a golden stat hung its counterpart in blue, A sharp reminder of one gone too fat To walk again the friendly street he knew. Long weeks ago his mother hung it there And still the dusk of grief is in her eyes And loneliness impossible to share Ox mitigate by kneeling where he lies. She neither dwells upon him nor evades The mention of his name when others ask; Though memory wounds each day with deeper blades, She goes with normal mien from task to task. At what a cost her courage has been won! I've seen her hang her pillow in the sun. Page 7 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?JANUARY 1946 II ? This star is many sons in one to her: A gurgling baby showing his first tooth, A tear-stained youngster pleading for a cur, A proud boy scout, a gangling, earnest youth. She knew his untried strength, his zest for life, Ideals he thought worth fighting to uphold, The girl he loved and hoped to make his wife And sharp cessation in this star of gold. To me, it is a symbol of the loss Of myriads of men who went beyond The lonely foxhole to the small white cross In Libyan sands or brushed by tropic frond. Oh, modern wise men, kneel in reverence Before this star and offer recompense! III ? The roaring wings that tore the world apart And made a mockery of miles and weather Can fly the lanes of peace and make a start Toward landing fields where all men walk together As neighbors should. Then, though he lies in sands Long burned by suns, or under shaggy palm Or chestnut tree or where the linden stands, His timeless sleeping shall be sound and calm. There was another star, another cross, Another wound that grew a rose as red; They hold the answer to my neighbor's loss. This star can lead us as the other led The shepherd's feet. Though high the goal and far, Can we deny the beckoning of a star? Eva Willes Wangsgaard, Ogden, Utah, is the author of three books of poetry: Singing Hearts, Down This Road, and After the Blossoming. Her poems have appeared in many national periodicals including the American Mercury, the Saturday Evening Post, the New York Times, and the Washington D. C. Post, and in such poetry magazines as Wings, Spirit, and the Florida Magazine of Verse. She placed first in the Huckelberry Mountain Colony's Poetry Contest in 1943, the only time in the history of the contest when all five of the judges chose the same poem. There were 1500 entries. Mrs. Wangsgaard has won awards in many other contests, including: The Deseret News Christmas Poetry Contest, 1938, 1939, 1940, and 1942; first in the Eliza R. Snow Memorial Prize Poem Contest in 1941 and second in 1938; first in the Utah Federation of Women's Clubs Poetry Contest, 1939; first in the League of Utah Writer's Poetry Contest 1940 and 1942, and second in 1941. Her poem "To Betsy Ross" first published in the New York Herald-Tribune, June 14, 1945, was reprinted in various newspapers and broadcast on the "World Homemakers" program from Chicago on "V-J" Day. Wife of David Wangsgaard, Assistant Superintendent of Ogden City Schools, Mrs. Wangsgaard is the mother of three children, the oldest a first lieutenant stationed in Tokyo.

CAROLINE EYRING MINER Third Prize Poem She Good Inheritance Caroline Eyring Miner I ? Earth All this is mine: the warm and fertile earth That yearns to yield her body to the seed Of purpling grape, of grain, of flower; the speed Of swallow darting through the dusk to find His mate; the miracle of human birth; The beauty of the changing sky; the need Of sun and rain for growth; the slender reed That trails the stream and sways against the wind And echoes back all songs the world has known; The hour when the sun has set, and light Along the mountains frames one Star alone; The heat of summer and the shade's delight. All this, the earth, the sea, the sky, in mood Both gay and sad, God gave, and called it good. II ?

Prize-Winning Story Annual Relief Society Short Story Contest First Prize Story Spring Festival Mary Ek Knowles IT was Josef Straubel's fiftieth birthday, but he had forgotten all about that. As he stood on the corner of Main and Second Street waiting for his bus, his mind was troubled with last minute anxieties concerning the Spring Festival which was to be presented at eight o'clock that evening. Again he went over the program, his head moving slowly from side to side like a metronome as mentally he checked off each act. The kindergarten class? A Spring Flower Garden . . . first grade? Presenting Robin Red Breast . . . second grade . . . and so on down the program to seventh grade? Violin Solo? Mendelssohn's "Spring Song"? Greta Johanson. The program must be a success! Mr. Jessop and Mr. Bard of the school board were going to be there. Maybe if they saw how hard everyone had worked to make the Festival a success despite the handicap of only an antiquated gymnasium in which to present the program, they would see that Lincoln School got an auditorium. Doubts chilled Josef. The red velvet curtains donated by Mrs. O'Toole were very heavy. Would the wire stretched across one end of the gym hold! The spotlight? pray that Benny Lee controlled the imp in him, and kept it trained on the stage. Would the audience grow tired sitting on the backless benches? What if the fifth grade a cappella choir sang off key. And Greta Johanson? could he depend on her or would the weakness he had detected in h er character betray them at the last moment! 14 So Josef worried, and then suddenly a warm breeze caressed his cheek, and, rising above the confusion of the busy street, the smell of oil and gasoline, there was the scent of hyacinths. A crowded bus parked at the curb whizzed away and for a moment Josef's view was unobstructed. Across the street was the public square, like a painting done in water colors, hyacinths, lacy maple trees, a flowering almond bush, a golden forsythia, bright as sunshine. Josef breathed deep and his blood tingled. It was spring again. The opening bars of "Spring Song'? pianissimo, and with much expression?danced through his brain. One hand fell to his side, his fingers drummed out the notes on his trouser leg. In that moment Josef felt that the Festival would be a success. Lincoln School would get its auditorium. His heart was singing the "Spring Song" now, his fingers moving rapidly, crescendo, fortissimo... A shiny black car drove up to the curb and blotted out spring. A tall, heavy-set man got out. He slammed the car door, and gave clipped orders to his chauffeur. Then he turned. Josef saw his face, and his memory fumbled around like fingers searching for the right key on the piano. There was something familiar about the thin-lipped mouth, the square jaw. The man pushed his way through the crowd like a football player carrying the ball. Josef's memory found the right key, and the note was clear and true. Henry Biglow! Forward on the Camden University team, class of 1914! "Henry!" Josef called. "Henry Biglow!" RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?JANUARY 1946 The man stopped and looked back. Josef hurried forward, smiling. "Henry, you old culprit! Are you?" Henry Biglow frowned down at Josef, ignoring the outstretched hand. Then, slowly, recognition dawned, and he started to laugh, softly at first, then a roaring laugh so that people turned and stared. "Josef Straubel! What are you doing in Sanford?" "Tm teaching music at Lincoln School." "In the slums! Why, the last time I saw you, you were all set with a scholarship at Boston Conservatory of Music. What happened?" OSEF did not answer. He remembered the scholarship, and how young and eager he had been, and the memory was like the sweet strains of some forgotten melody. How to tell Henry Biglow that an undersized kid in a ragged, striped jersey had changed his plans. A skinny kid saying, "Mr. Straubel, you ain't goin' away, are yu?" "Still the idealist, aren't you?" Henry's laugh cut deep, and his small black eyes missed nothing. He took his hand out of his pocket, and Josef saw the diamond on his little finger sparkle. 'Well, I'm still the hardheaded realist. Get what I mean? Bye!" Still laughing, he pushed his way through the crowd. Yes, Josef "got" what his former classmate had meant. "You be an idealist," Henry used to say in those college days. "I'll be a realist, and we'll see who comes out on top." Josef winced as he remembered the scorn in Biglow's voice. Somehow he had never thought of his life in terms of failure or success. SPRING FESTIVAL Time had passed so rapidly, days into weeks, weeks into months, and suddenly there were years, thirty of them. He remembered then that today was his birthday and he was fifty years old. He saw his reflection in the plate glass of the hotel door. It was not reassuring. He saw a short fat man in a shabby black suit, the jacket of which was stretched almost to the breaking point so that the top button could be buttoned. A gray felt hat of ancient vintage was perched atop his head. Under his left arm he carried a portfolio full to bursting. His right hand toyed with a fraternity pin dangling from the watch chain looped across his vest. He heard someone say, "There's the Willowcreek bus now!" He remembered the Spring Festival and that if he missed this bus he would have to wait a half hour for another. He ran for the bus. Josef Straubel lived at No. 7 Gunnel Court. The advertisement had described the house as within easy walking distance of town, furnished. Josef, the graduate, had found the rent cheap, the house a two-room frame, small, but with a bit of rearranging, large enough for his baby grand piano, his books and his music. Plenty good enough to live in for the short time until he went to Boston. He had paid a month's rent in advance. He had stayed thirty years. The light was on, and when Josef opened the door and walked into the small crowded front room, Mrs. Hennessey, his landlady, came out of the tiny kitchen, a spoon in her hand, a starched percale apron covering her ample form. "Hope you don't mind my just barging in like this," she said, "with you gone and all. But it was getting late, and I knew you'd be rushed, what with your big program and all, so I come over and brought you a bit of stew and a piece of rhubarb "That was very kind of you!" Warmth for Mrs. Hennessey with her friendly manner, and her gray hair crimped about her big face, filled him. He had a sudden impulse to tell Mrs. Hennessey what Henry Bigelow had said. After all he had known her for thirty years. He would tell her 'a she would say, "Well, the high and mighty, who does he think he is, anyhow!" And they would laugh, and the feeling that swept over him like nausea every time he remembered what Henry had said would go away. He opened his mouth to speak, then shut it again. He just wanted to forget the whole thing. He laid his portfolio on the grand piano, tossed his hat on a chair. "Come, eat up, now," Mrs. Hennessey said as she walked back into the kitchen. "Get the food while it's hot!" JOSEF saw that Mrs. Hennessey had straightened the lean-to kitchen, washed the breakfast dishes and set the narrow table. He went to the sink, ran water into the enamel basin, and washed his hands and face. "I ironed your shirt, but I told Pa, 'Hennessey,' I said, 'how much longer Mr. Straubel thinks this shirt'll last I don't know.? Had to patch it again on the elbow. And your suit! It's that shiny in the seat!" Through the mirror Josef saw her 16 stand with hands on her broad hips. "Grew Brothers are havin' a sale this week. Good white shirts $1.97 and suits $25.89. Whyn't you let me buy you some clothes? You only have to pay five down and five a month." Josef suppressed a groan. Money, money! Somehow he never had enough to go around. This month he'd be lucky if he had enough left over to pay his rent and buy food. There was the bill at Kendall Music Company, the last payment on the loan at Friendly Credit. He smiled ruefully at himself in the mirror and the lines at the corners of his mouth deepened. "I?ll have to do that, Mrs. Hennessey. One of these days I'll have to do that." "And where have I heard that before!" Mrs. Hennessey threw a jacket around her shoulders, and her face was red. "It's just about time, Josef Straubel, that you started thinkin' of yourself for a change. So all-fired generous with them students of yourn. And do they appreciate it! Mark my words, someday you'll be sorry you was such a soft touch!" "Next month, Mrs. Hennessey. Next month I'm going to outfit myself like a dude. You'll see!" "W ell?we'll just see." Mrs. Hennessey hesitated, her hand on the front doorknob, her voice gentler. "Hope your program goes off all right, and you get your auditorium." "Thank you, Mrs. Hennessey." Left alone, Josef stood in the center of the room and looked around him. The room seemed to have shrunk in size. The piano took almost half the space. Everywhere were books, filling the three-shelf bookcase, piled on top, stacked on RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?JANUARY 1946 the floor in the corner. Music was piled on the piano?music for operettas, choruses, a half-completed Christmas cantata. Photographs of former students were hung on the wall above the piano. Somewhere among the clutter was a letter informing Josef Straubel that he had won a scholarship. He had placed it there that spring day long ago. He had come home from school with Eddie Thompson's words ringing in his ears, he had thought, I'll stay on at Lincoln just long enough to help straighten Eddie out. Thirty years, he thought, and this is all I have. This and a pile of debts, a worn suit and a patched shirt. It was so still that the ticking of the clock on the wall sounded loud. He remembered the Spring Festival. If only Lincoln got its auditorium, then it would be as if the days and weeks and months of that thirty years were blended into a triumphant song. WHEN he reached Lincoln School, the lights were on, and cars were parked on both sides of the street for blocks. All the fears came back, and he hurried through the side door, down the long hall that smelled of chalk and that oil peculiarly' like citronella. He opened the door of room one. Paperclad children rushed to him. "Here's Mr. Straubel now!" Miss Deal smiled toothily. "They were afraid you might muss the bus!" Josef saw Robin Red Breast, the members of the a cappella choir, the flower garden... But no Greta Johanson. "Where's Greta?" he asked. SPRING FESTIVAL Miss Deal looked worried. "I haven't seen her. It's getting late, too!" He went to look for her, the apprehension within him deepening. He couldn't depend on her, then. All these months had been for nothing! I he passed the music room, a voice called to him. "Oh, here you are Greta!"' Relief swept over him. Greta held her violin tight in her hands. "Mr. Straubel, I'm scared. All those people out there, all those faces watching me. What if I forget the music, what if I play off key!" So it was only stage fright. Josef looked at Greta's broad, pale face, saw the fear in her blue eyes. He saw, too, the new blue taffeta dress, obviously homemade, yet covering so proudly the tall lanky body. He took her hand in his. It was like ice. "Greta," he said kindly, "listen to me. I know what you can do. I know that you are going to forget everything but your violin and the song you want it to play. You're going to be a big success, Greta." She looked at him for a long moment, and seemed to draw strength from his words. She smiled. "I'll try awful hard, Mr. Straubel." The small gym was so crowded that people were sitting in the windows, standing in doorways. He saw Mr. Jessop and Mr. Bard sitting on chairs right in front. Mr. Jessop looked over the crowd, then bent and whispered to Mr. Bard. This should convince them we need an auditorium, Josef thought. He stood before the orchestra and raised his baton. He led them through the overture, held his breath 17 as two brown elves pulled back the red velvet drapes. But the wire held firm, and for the next hour and a half Josef forgot himself, he forgot Henry Biglow. The show was going over. One by one the acts came on, did their parts, bowed their way out to enthusiastic applause. And soon it was the last act. Greta Johanson stood before them, and as she played, Josef listened with the critical ear of a musician, He heard clear tone, a sureness of touch. But there was something else, too, an emotion that was Greta's own, that something that no teacher, no matter how excellent, could give her. He looked at Greta. There was something regal about the lanky figure in the cheap dress. He remembered Greta as she was that day two years ago when he kept her after class. "Don't you like music, Greta?" Her defiant attitude during class had been very noticeable. "Music!" she sneered. Her childish face was thick with make-up, her hair a tangled mop, her clothes too tight, too short on her tall body. Jors= had said nothing, but sometimes when the orchestra was playing, he had seen a look in Greta's eyes. He once took his violin from the top of the piano and played a few bars of Schubert's "Serenade." Greta was at his side. "That's what I wanna do," she choked. "Play the violin!" "Then why don't you?" "You kiddin'?" Her eyes filled with tears. "My old man ain't got enough money to feed us, let alone buy me a violin." "I have an inexpensive violin I could let you borrow, and I could give you the first lessons." Josef came back to the present as "The Spring Song" ended with two perfectly blended chords played softly. Since then there had been times when Greta had been unpredictable, unstable, but now he knew suddenly that she was going to be all right. There was a moment's hushed silence, then the audience burst into thunderous applause. Josef arose, satisfaction for a job well done filling him. Lincoln would get its auditorium. He turned to see Mr. Jessop and Mr. Bard walking out the side door. People were filing out without so much as a backward glance. In a surprisingly short time, the crowd was gone, and Josef was alone standing by the piano, his hand outstretched. He sank down weakly on the piano stool. He had been mistaken, then, and the program hadn't been a success. Even in this he was a failure. Disappointment was like a heavy stone crushing him. "Mr. Straubel, please!" Josef turned. A woman stood beside him. A red kerchief was tied over her head, a shabby black coat was draped on her tall form. Her work-worn hands were clasped tight before her. "Oh?hello, Mrs. Johanson." She spoke with a thick accent. "Mr. Straubel. I come to thank you. Tonight I sit there, I listen my Greta play, I think, so is she now, sweet and good, playing like a musician on the radio, yet. But so it was not always. How many nights I wait up, not knowing where is Greta?" "Greta was never bad, Mrs. Johanson," Josef defended. "It was RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?JANUARY 1946 just that she had this restlessness, this?all she needed was to have that great energy directed into the right channels." "Yah, I know! But nobody knew how to doit. Nobody but you?" "I just loaned her my violin?" "Nah! You not have one to loan. You buy her one." "Such an inexpensive one!" "You not foolin' me. Professor Lanz, he say it a good one.. Yah, I know. To everyone else Professor Lanz is three dollars, to mine Greta fifty cents." Tears were running down her lined face. Embarrassed, Josef looked away from her. "Someday we pay you back, Mr. Straubel. But now?all I can give you is a mother's blessin'. God bless you, Mr. Straubel!" She turned and hurried out of the gymnasium. Josef Straubel stared in the direction in which she had gone. It was true, of course. For eighteen months he had been paying for her lessons. From the first he had known Greta had unusual talent. How could he see it go to waste? Since that day when little Eddie looked up at him so pleadingly, he had not been able to turn a gifted child away. He had never tried to put the thought into words before, but now it came to him that the soul of a wayward child was like music played in discord, but if the melody could be found, then it would be like a symphony. He thought of the different students he had known. "Incorrigibles," he had heard them called. Never had he failed to reach them through music. Bob Ginsburg?the cornet had appealed to him. Marie Serpentine?the accordion for her. Sammy Lewis... Mose Washington. SPRING FESTIVAL Mose had been a puzzler until Josef saw the look on his ebony face when the drummer went through his tricks. The money it had cost him, he had not missed. A few minutes later he was walking home through the spring night. "Josef Straubel," he told himself, "Henry Biglow was right. You're fifty years old, and a failure." But he didn't care. He knew that if he had his life to live over, he would do just as he had done. He was sorry about the auditorium, but somehow they'd manage. He knew the quiet peace of a man who has found his destiny. It was late when he reached the small house. He turned the key in 19 the lock, opened the door. Lights flashed on, the night rang with cries of, "Happy Birthday!" Josef stood quite still, his hand on the doorknob. He saw the faces of students, teachers, the smiling face of Mrs. Hennessey. On the kitchen table was a birthday cake, and gifts stacked high. Mr. Jessop and Mr. Bard came toward him smiling, and he knew that Lincoln School would get its auditorium. In that moment he would not have traded places with all the Henry Biglows in the world. The little house was full, so full that it seemed the walls would burst, yet even so, not so full as Josef Straubel's heart. Mary Ek Knowles of Ogden, Utah, is the wife of Roland C.

Even the deaf feel vibrations. Some people have their feelings for music pent up in them, are musically tongue-tied, unable to produce a sound in key. Some people, when in the country, may not be aware that birds are singing, may not feel the romantic influence of music, and yet may have music within them needing only an awakening ?Anonymous. Nicholas G. Smith?A Tribute Elder Marion G. Romney Assistant to the Council of the Twelve N all my memory pictures of Nicholas G. Smith, there stands at his side Florence Gay Smith, his life's companion. They exemplified the Master's teaching, "For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh. Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh" (Matt. 19:5-6). From Salt Lake City to South Africa, from Southern California to the Northwest and Alaska, at home and abroad, their lives ran together in an undivided current. Under their guidance, there developed in their home an unusually fine relationship between themselves as parents and their four sons. Rarely do parents enjoy the unrestrained confidence of their children as did they. Nicholas shared with his wife and family the fullness of his rich life, and judged in the light of eternity, his life was rich indeed. All but eight of his adult years he spent filling some major assignment in his Master's service. Often he had more than one such assignment at a time. Between thirteen and fourteen years he spent in the mission field; eighteen months as a high councilman; twelve and one-half years on the General Board of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association; twelve years as bishop of the Seventeenth Ward; three years as Acting Patriarch to the Church; three years in the presidency of the Salt Lake Temple; and four and one-half years Page 20 NICHOLAS G. SMITH as an Assistant to the Council of the Twelve Apostles. As I think of this service, the 37th verse of the 13th chapter of First Nephi comes to my mind: And blessed are they who shall seek to bring forth my Zion at that day, (when the Book of Mormon should come forth) for they shall have the gift and the power of the Holy Ghost: and if they endure unto the end they shall be lifted up at the last day, and shall be saved in the everlasting kingdom of the Lamb; and whoso shall publish peace, yea, tidings of great joy, how beautiful upon the mountains shall they be. NICHOLAS G. SMITH?A TRIBUTE The strength of his youth and the wisdom of his maturity he freely gave in publishing peace and declaring tidings of great joy. The whole purpose of his life was to assist in _ bringing forth Zion. And he endured to the end, which is the condition upon which the blessings of eternal life and exaltation are predicated. 21 Surely he was of the blessed who are described as being "beautiful upon the mountains." He and his family had before his passing, and his family now has, a sure hope that he shall be lifted up at the last day. AFTER A WHILE Maude Hatch Benedict After a while when lessons are all learned And we no longer need this vale of tears, The dreads, the heartaches, suffered by all men Will lift like pearly dawn, to banish fears. Thrown on the velvet blackness of the scroll God's hand will be revealed to startled gaze, As stars shine brightest in the deepest blue, The truth will gleam in radiance to amaze. We then shall know how blinding griefs of ours Have seemed to pass unnoticed by his eye, The things we prayed and longed for most of all, Unanswered, unattained, we knew not why. Perhaps his wisdom keeps from us today Our soul's desire, spoken or unexpressed, But we shall come to know his plans go on, And gratefully concede he knoweth best. Life may not be God's greatest gift to man, The "after while" will prove, and we shall know The hand of death, though grim, sometimes conceals The fairest gift his mercy can bestow. We cannot tear aside the screening veil, But when life's race is run, and tired feet Are come at last to rest, we then shall know The wisdom of his ways is love complete! Drifting?Or Sailing To A Charted Course? Lella Marler Hoggan Illustrations by Dora Marler Williams RE you drifting on the sea of life without compass, oar, or rudder? Do you think that by some chance of fate your frail craft will reach a safe harbor? The experience of all the years can hold out no such hope for you. Whatever course you travel, you have no assurance of a satisfactory journey and a safe arrival at your desired destination unless you have some sort of guidance. Those going before us have charted the seas and set signal lights on the rocky coasts. They have made beaten paths through the dark forests and placed guideposts along the highway of life. For hundreds of years civilization has been patrolling the roads that men's feet must travel, in order that humanity might have a less perilous and a more comfortable journey. The high privileges and great advantages that we now enjoy were not easily won. Many of them have come to us over the altar of sacrifice. Men have literally gone through fire and blood and death to remove barriers to progress and_ to establish the light of truth. Among the unforgettable ideals that have helped to shape the course of man's destiny, are the rules that Moses brought to the Children of Israel. Graven on tablets of stone by a divine hand, they come down Page 22 the years to us, and now stand as the foundation of civil law. Another eternal document that has come to us from the past for our guidance and safety, is the Master's Sermon on the Mount. Had mankind but followed the light of this divine beacon, probably we would not have experienced the most cruel and devastating war of all time. These inspired rules of life, these fundamental truths, outline safe paths that lead to a desirable destination. Is it not prudent that we should follow them, that we should walk in the light of the torch of experience to our own betterment? The past has endowed us with priceless gifts of achievement. All of the wisdom and the beauty and the power that the centuries have accumulated has been poured into the vast reservoir of common knowledge. And the child of today has free access to this golden store. Although these blessings are free to all men, we can claim them only through our personal effort. We have to dig and delve to secure the gold that is hidden in the dark recesses of the earth. Other treasures are acquired in a similar manner. We must pay the price if we would receive the reward. We cannot drift with the tide and yet hope to reach the harbor of our dreams. If we desire to enjoy the rich heritage that life holds in store for us, we may be sure we shall have to follow a charted course to a definite goal. Obedience to accepted rules of conduct saves us from becoming human driftwood. A long time ago Confucius declared that "Personal character can only be established on fixed principles." And Aristotle asserted, "Freedom is obedience to self-formulated rules." I is true that "we can write our own price-tags."" But we cannot give ourselves double promotions unless we are able to pass the tests. The germs of truth and beauty that lie dormant within us will come to a full flowering only through study, prayer, work, and suffering. Honesty and integrity, courage and reliability, do not come by chance. Like other worth-while characteristics, they are developed through cultivation and training. We have to live the law to obtain the blessing. Our loved poet Ella Wheeler Wilcox wrote: Who sows in weakness cannot reap in strength, That which we plant we gather in at length. You can be your own worst enemy or your own best friend. Don't be wheedled into wrecking your own life. It is lack of ambition that lets today's convenience outweigh tomorrow's development. Why permit yourself to drift with the tide and be tossed about by the fitful winds of circumstances like a scrap of bleached deadwood? If you find that your impulses are carrying you downstream, let judgment grasp the oars and reverse the course of your sailing. "Make yourself responsible for yourself," urges a modern divine. We can spend our days loitering listlessly along in the lowlands of life or we can lift ourselves to the stars. In charting our course of action, let us accept the guidance that the wisdom of the years provides. Whether our journey be short or ? longer, we can make life richer, more radiant, and altogether more satisfying, if we work with a purpose toward a definite achievement. DRIFTING?OR SAILING TO A CHARTED COURSE 23 24 And be assured we are never alone in our efforts; for now, as always, "God helps those who help themselves." No matter what other guidance we accept, let us so live that we may always be able to hear "the still, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?JANUARY 1946 small voice of the Spirit," which the Master said would guide us unto all truth. The person who holds daily communion with the Most High is sustained and directed by the great: est power in the universe. ELIJAH Alice Morrey Bailey ?? TRANSLATION OF ELIJAH Elijah's hour was near, his years bent low, Though yet he walked with God in faith. The birds Had fed him in the wilderness. So runs This ancient drama?told in ancient words. Elisha walked beside him as he went, And out of every town came bold men?young? And asked him: "Knowest thou his hour is come?" He answered: "Yea! I know it. Hold thy tongue!" And when Elijah bade him: "'Tarry here, I pray thee, for the Lord hath sent me on." He answered: "As He liveth, and as lives thy soul, I will not leave thee! But ere thou hast gone Give me of thy spirit?much?a double share." Through all these hallowed towns they walked: Gilgal, Bethel, Jericho?beyond The Jordan's flood. As they went on?and talked Behold there came a chariot of fire, And fiery steeds?and they were thrust apart. Elijah, spared the bitterness of death, Went up to heaven in a whirlwind's heart. ? THE VISION Thus is he a link of death and life? Eternally of both?of heaven, earth. He is the key, long chosen, fitted, forged ELIJAH 25 To turn our hearts to them who gave us birth. The centuries roll away, and time is full, Once again men build a house to God; A prophet and his aide kneeling in prayer? Before their eyes 4 glorious vision shines And Jesus stands before this righteous pair. His eyes are as a flame of fire?as snow His hair?his face shines brighter than the sun? His feet rest on an amber work of gold? The voice of God as rushing water comes. "I am the first and last and he who lives, And who was slain?your brother. I espouse Your cause before the throne. Your sins are gone. My name ls here and I accept this house." THE KEYS He is gone, and in his place is (ne Who gathered Israel out of Egypt's hold, Now this same Moses comes and brings the keys To gather Israel out of all the world. He is gone. Elias comes?who stood Transfigured with the Savior up on high? And brings a dispensation's key, that men And nations will be blessed. The time is nigh; The great and dreadful day is at the door. Foretold by Malachi, Elijah comes, Lest all the earth be smitten with a curse, To touch a kinsman's bond in fathers, A hundred years and more have passed since then; His spirit moves On men in every land, Regardless of their birth and heart and creed; Their books and records mount as he has planned. Baal and Jezebel and Ahab?all are gone. Now, lest an altar drown in sloth and shirk, May Elijah's hand stretch forth in power And kindle into flame desire to work! Unceasing Crusade The National Foundation For Infantile Paralysis HE prayers of the nation for those stricken in infantile paralyses epidemics are answered each January by millions of Americans through the March of Dimes. America's record contributions to the 1945 appeal of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis poured new strength into the crusade against the Great Crippler. Poliomyelitis, merciless enemy of both adults and children, claimed more than 13,000 victims in this country last year, fourth worst polio year on record. Epidemics raged in Tennessee, Utah, Illinois, New York, and Montana, while outbreaks of the disease occurred so generally that 26 states reported more cases than in 1944, worst year since 1916. The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, with its local chapters throughout the country, joined forces with local and state health authorities to combat polio wherever it struck. Living up to its pledge that "no victim of polio shall go untreated for lack of funds, regardless of age, race, creed or color," the National Foundation sent nearly $1,000,000 in emergency aid to epidemic areas, supplementing the dwindling funds of local chapters. Poliomyelitis is one of the most expensive diseases known to medicine. Many victims of past epidemics must receive continuing care, sometimes for several years. Each year's outbreaks add new names to the steadily growing list. Hospitalization for a single patient costs more than Page 26 $2,500 per year. Very few family budgets can stand such a strain. Eight years ago, the late Franklin D. Roosevelt founded the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis in fulfillment of the growing need for an organized fight against polio and a '"'general staff" to direct that fight. Basil O'Connor, personal friend and former law partner of Mr. Roosevelt, has been the Foundation's president since its formation. Before the National Foundation was launched, infantile paralysis was considered a "local affair." From the most isolated farm to the largest city, men, women, and children often had to fight the disease with inadequate resources. Today, a national network of local Foundation chapters stands ready to combat polio wherever it appears and to provide continuing care for patients from former outbreaks. Each chapter, wherever it may be, has the total backing of the National organization. Last summer a Tennessee chapter desperately needed an "iron lung." ?The National Foundation had one flown from New York City. North Carolina chapters needed. Funds to provide care and treatment for scores of patients stricken during the Hickory epidemic of 1944. The National Foundation last year sent more than $200,000 to North Carolina for that purpose. Rockford, Illinois, was the center of a serious epidemic last summer. Stephenson County in the same state was badly hit. The Foundation last UNCEASING CRUSADE year advanced more than a quarter million dollars in epidemic aid to local chapters in that state. Action and aid in epidemics are the more obvious and dramatic aspects of the National Foundation's work. Everyone who has seen a polio outbreak knows this part of the organization's work. But there is another, less spectacular and less familiar, aspect: science. The Foundation, in its eight-year history, has appropriated $7,673,113 for scientific work: for research toward the goal of a Preventive and a cure for infantile paralysis, for the training of physicians, nurses, physical therapists, medical social workers and others in modern methods of treating and helping polio victims, for a broad program of education? a never-ending campaign to give the facts about polio to the people of America. The fight is costly and grows more costly as the National Founda. Tion expands all phases of its activities and meets the cost of polio epidemics. Of all contributions in any county to the annual March of Dimes conducted by the Foundation, half is retained by the local chapter for special equipment, hospitalization, transportation, treatment and care of polio patients. The other half goes to the national organization for research, education, and emergency aid in epidemics. Standing ready to give battle on every Sector of the polio front, the National: Foundation for Infantile Paralysis is a vital weapon of the working people?a weapon against the common enemy, poliomyelitis.

She was full of life and zest. She had then, as she has now, an unusually attractive personality. She was admired and loved by all her associates, She was beautiful in appearance then, as a girl, and she is beautiful now as a woman. THE WEIGHT OF YOUR CLOUD Edna S.

Clark Brigham Young University Copyright 1946 1?DOLLY MADISON AND THE OUTCAST MORMONS (First installment of a series of articles on early Latter-day Saint history) RESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR., recently said in a conference address:.. In this crisis we turn to the women of the earth... To save us men from ourselves. So it has been, in reality, in every great world crisis, however much it may have seemed otherwise. This statement recalled to my memory a bit of forgotten Mormon history of nearly one hundred years ago. It was October 1847. The Mormons had been driven out of Illinois and across the neighboring states to the West. Some of them had reached the Great Salt Lake and established new homes. Countless other thousands were still homeless 'in Iowa. 'These were faced that winter with some of the same problems that the millions in Europe face this winter of 1946?lack of food, lack of shelter, and lack of clothing. They, too, in 1847, had just escaped from armed conflict. What was to be done? Who would step forward and alleviate the suffering of these thousands in the "wilderness of the Far West?" Who was to bind up the wounds of war? Was there no one in the nation who would champion Page 28 the cause of the unpopular Mormons? Yes. A great metropolitan newspaper owner, James Gordon Bennett, the same who sent Stanley to rescue Livingston, became the Mormon champion. While Bennett was lending the weight of his powerful New York Daily Herald to the cause, in Washington, D. C., the women of the capital led by Dolly Madison, wife of James Madison, ex-president of the United States, and Mrs. James K. Polk, the first lady of the land, were united in raising funds for the outcast Mormons. The New York Herald for October 29, 1847, said: The Ladies' Tea-Party for the Benefit of the Mormons The ladies' tea party for the relief of the 1,500 Mormons in the wilderness of the Far West, was opened this evening at Carusi's, and a most successful opening it was. We shall have something to say about it tomorrow. Suffice it for the present, that the ladies of all denominations, all over the city, headed by the mayor and the clergy went heart and hand into the work. MORMONISM IN THE EYES OF THE PRESS The venerable Mrs. Ex-president Madison, Mrs. Polk, Mrs. General Macomb, and many others of the most influential and highly respected and most beautiful of the metropolis, were united in this benevolent of these ladies, their exertions and their Contributions heart to feel, and a head to appreciate true charity, the will be as A fortnight since, Mr. Dana came to this city ( Washington ) and asked for help for the suffering Mormons driven off into the uninhabited wilds of Iowa. Of the city was published meeting was accordingly held; but Prejudice was well nigh a famishing People, their Motto is, we must help them; and they Straightway set to Work about it. 29 So they did in this case, Prejudice was against them, The Mormons, by many persons, are regarded as a miserable, degraded gang of outcasts, not entitled to the common sympathies of humanity. But the ladies of Washington ruled that these people were entitled to relief, and that they must have it. Accordingly, the Benevolent Society held several preliminary meetings at the house of Mrs. Reed, late of Mississippi, a daughter of General Duff Green, residing now on C Street; and the result of these deliberations was a resolution for a tea party. So a few mornings since, a large number of delegates, appointed by said society, sallied out to canvas the city, for the distribution, at fifty cents each, of the following ticket of admission . . . and so last night the affair came off; the house was full ? a refined and benevolent audience. The ticket secured a dish of coffee or tea of the best; the extras were oysters in every style, meats and confectionary, and bouquets. The dispensers of these things were among the best and most elevated and beautiful of the metropolis. Then, at intervals, we had the music of the marine band and the songs of the European Minstrels, a new company of singers, with Mr. T. V. H. Crosby at their head. Then there was a promenade in progress all the time, and from first to last the entertainment was elegant and agreeable to young and old of all sexes, ages and denominations. Mrs. Ex-President Madison, that good and venerable lady, was a contributor, and, but for indisposition, would have been present last night to have parcelled out that large cake which contains the magic gold ring. In her absence, the office was awarded unanimously to Mrs. General Macomb, a Ways active in an work of charity; but the division of the cake was reserved fir this evening. Mrs. President Polk, never forgetful of the claims of the destitute, sent down a number of rare bouquets, and a liberal supply of confectionary, including a cedar tree hung full of French candies, kisses and sugar plumbs. No such fruit as that grows in the gardens of Jalapa. Mrs. P. has been suffering from the chills, or she would have given the party a call during the evening.  30 While this tea Party and the publicity it received in the New York Herald may not have greatly altered Mormon history, the fact that it remains unrecorded in Mormon history books may cause us to fail to appreciate the fact that there were champions of the Mormon cause outside the Church even in the darkest hours of 1847, and the fact that this sympathy and support came from the famous Dolly Madison and from the "First Lady of the Land," Mrs. James K. Polk, should cause the women of Mormondom to be proud that it was those of their sex who reached out the hand of charity when all others had refused or failed. So: "In times of crisis we turn to the women of the earth." RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?JANUARY 1946 SHOPPING FOR A DOLL Hazel Jones Owen I started out early to shop for a doll? It must be the dearest and sweetest of all. I searched every store, seeking my prize, But I couldn't decide on the color of eyes. And should it have golden or dark brown hair? (What kind of clothes, I didn't much care) Should each little cheek have a dimple in? Or should it have one dimple just in its chin? I wearied of searching and looking about, And quite faint heartedly went home without The doll I so eagerly set out to find Because I just couldn't make up my mind. That night as I sat by her wee little bed, A faint light shining on her tousled head, I wondered, dear Lord, did you have such a time In choosing this loveliest baby of mine? Let Us Fittingly Mark the Land Elder Howard R. Driggs (Prepared at the Request of the Church Beautification Committee) home town of Pleasant Grove to Salt Lake City the other day, we saw an out-of-state car pausing before the roadside marker the Highway Commission has built to tell of the first battle of the pioneers with the Indians in Utah. Again, as we rounded the "Point of the Mountain," we observed another such car parked at the monument built by members of the adult Aaronic priesthood to commemorate the Pony Express. As the children in the party were reading the story on the bronze plaque, the father was taking a snapshot. Vivid memories of the first fast mail of the West, these young Americans would carry away to their home and schools. A letter from a dear old friend from Ohio was awaiting me when we reached our apartment. In part it read: I recall with a great deal of happiness our trip to the top of the Big Mountain and then down into the Valley following the route of the famous migration, and am glad to know that an appropriate memorial is to be erected. A nation without monuments, memorials and shrines is one without worth-while history. What makes travel interesting? Impressive scenery, yes; well-kept homes and farms, certainly; well-bred folk, of course. Yet, added to all this, is another thing that gives spiritual meaning to any tip. That is drama. People love to linger around places where things of import have been enacted. Precious landmarks and story spots lure travelers to linger and learn. Our National Capital with its throbbing activities is ever a place of a thousand attractions. It is there one may feel the pulse of the whole world. Yet most folk who visit the city are likely to remember best and longest?if they have the privilege? the trip down the quiet old Potomac to the home and the tomb of Washington. And all who go there are profoundly grateful that a patriotic group of Americans preserved in its beauty and storied significance the sacred shrine?Mount Vernon. Likewise are visitors to Philadelphia filled with gratitude that old Independence Hall, the home of Betsy Ross, and other shrines have been saved. We are deeply indebted, also, to those who have kept for us such historic landmarks as Old South Church, Paul Revere's home in Boston, the Alamo in San Antonio, Sutter's Fort in Sacramento. And our hearts go out always to the group of surveyors of the Burlington Railroad, who, finding the tire-marked grave of Rebecca Winters on the Mormon Trail, changed the survey to let this pioneer mother rest in peace. These sacred shrines, we should remember, do not save themselves. Nor do the old trails, where "Pilgrim feet?a thoroughfare for freedom beat across the wilderness," mark themselves. Page 31 32 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?JANUARY 1946 OLD CENTRAL SCHOOL, PLEASANT GROVE, UTAH The wing at the left was built in part from the adobes used in the first Pleasant Grove schoolhouse built in 1852. The building is now used as a Hall of Memories by the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers and the centerpiece of a park dedicated to these nation builders. Someone has to take the initiative in this labor of love. Others of kindred spirit must join in the work. And such patriotic service is done not merely to remember the past; it is ever for the living present and the future. Our West, like other realms in their youth-time, has been somewhat slow in conserving its wealth of historical resources. Old things that seemed to be in the path of progress have often been not only neglected, but at times _ ruthlessly cleared away for more modem, less significant creations. This is not only unsound patriotism, but poor business. Let us face for a moment the suggestion that there is real money value in storied landmarks. The writer once asked of the late curator of Sutter's Fort?who had helped to change a run-down story spot to one of historic attractiveness?"How many out-of-town visitors registered at this old Fort last year?" "Considerably more 100,000," was the reply. "How much money, would you estimate, did each visitor leave in this city?" "That would be difficult to say; but certainly $5.00 each would be conservative." "What other business in this town brings in as much outside money?" was a final question. APPLY this to the throng of tourists attracted into Salt Lake City by reason of its historical and other attractions, or put the test to other cities that have kept their storied shrines. Whatever may be the conclusions as to the amount of money that comes from a proper preservation of such resources, it must be agreed that they pay richly for the effort. LET US FITTINGLY MARK THE LAND Any community that fails to keep and develop its historical heritage is financially short-sighted. There is, however, a deeper tea son for doing so. That is the preservation and development of the character of the community. In the lives of our pioneers is a spiritual force to be treasured and perpetuated. Through the prophet saving of the storied places that vibrate their spirit?the marking of the trails they made historic?we keep reminders of their sterling worth. To appreciate the worthy past is to fortify the future. 33 Not all landmarks, of course, are worth saving. Those that do exemplify the sturdy virtues of our nation-builders?that are filled with cherished memories?are priceless. There should ever be discrimination in this work?selection and development, to conserve historical monuments and to make them educationally attractive and upbuilding. It is a pleasure here to commend the town of my birth?Pleasant Grove. Through the devoted work of the Daughters of the Pioneers there and the understanding help of the city officials, the old schoolhouse has been preserved as a monument to the pioneers, and the lot on which it stands made a park dedicated to their memory. PRESIDENT GEORGE ALBERT SMITH AT TRAPPERS' RENDEZVOUS, BEAR LAKE Photograph by John D. Giles, taken in August 1937. 34 Plans are to develop this story spot, with the city, Daughters and Sons of the Pioneers, and the schools co-operating, into a fine memorial. Here is a pattern which other communities might follow in their own fine ways with profit. What has gone into the building of a town or state makes its character ?gives it individuality. Communities that treasure their fine traditions, that preserve landmarks and relics to keep the courageous past alive and vibrant, stand out for all who live there or who visit them. Places that become merely a collection of houses and stores and service stations are passed by unremembered. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?JANUARY 1946 It should be the pride of every town to develop its individuality. Certainly one of its storied buildings should be made a hall of memory?and it should have at least one block dedicated to the heroic men and women who gave their lives to the founding of the community. Another vital point: See that the historic trails that lead to your town are interestingly marked. Every community is linked with some such storied highway or byway?trails of the Indians, the pathfinding trappers, the pioneers. Many of these faded trails are in danger of oblivion. Here is challenging activity for young scouts, older ones who remember, and others, to reclaim a heritage and add to the attractiveness of the town and to travel. RECLAIMING A PONY EXPRESS STATION, "PASS" (DRY STATION) IN THE UTAH DESERT LET US FITTINGLY MARK THE LAND An awakening has come along these vital lines over the land. Many commendable things have already been accomplished by devoted, clear-seeing leaders in marking the trails and story spots, in developing wayside rests where travelers may linger and learn. Much more can be done. America is already again on the move. Years ahead will see throngs traveling. What is needed right now is well-directed, co-operative effort to help make this travel more 35 Why not center our efforts on teaching America? Why not do more to lure the speeding folk to linger and learn the dramatic story of the old trails? Why not stir every community to rise to its best?to bring out its fine American tradition ?its stirring pioneer story?its forward-looking history?, Nothing will do more for our country and the world than to keep alive the spirit of those who have given their all that this might be a land of freedom based on eternal righteousness. Opportunity is before every community to help impress this on the hearts of ??~<-? PROMISE Christie Lund Coles The world will go on much the same When I am gone, The night will come as stealthily As will the dawn. The silver evening, hushed and still, Will be as sweet, And children's laughter will resound Along the street; But this awareness, wild in me, As wind or bird, This sense of being, will it lie With flesh, interred, Within the earth that it has loved, Beneath the sky That its proud heart could circumvent, Must, must it die? The spring in splendor will return The bud, the leaf, I, too, will be aware again Beyond all grief. Fruitful?more spiritually uplifting.

The modest daisy still lifts its unassuming head and offers a singularly vigorous resistance to the encroachments of King Frost; an occasional dandelion puts in a half-starved appearance; a few clover blossoms even yet are warmed by the sunshine when it strikes some sequestered spot.... As the days creep on, the trees and hedges become bare.... All things tend to one common end.... Winter is coming with its sure and inevitable tread. The recurrence of the seasons to those who have the wisdom to learn, is not without profit; the return of each is a silent monitor which Infinite Goodness has set before the children of men to point a moral and so adorn the story of our lives as may fit us for the coming of that hour when we, too, shall fade as flowers?pass away unnoticed as a dry leaf in boundless forests?from among the habitations of the human race, and be hidden from memory's sight by the snows and frosts of time.?Wandering Boy. WOMAN'S INFLUENCE: We are inclined to think but few women are aware of the influence which women might wield, were they disposed to labor more earnestly in that field in which the Creator has placed them, instead of reaching out to untried fields of labor for which nature has not qualified them. We believe a large majority of the women of the present day are willing to work in that sphere of usefulness which God in his wisdom assigned to them, and, in conclusion, we will say your mission is an high and honorable one; therefore "be not weary in well-doing."?Selected.

BRITAIN'S only woman cabinet minister, "wee Ellen" Wilkinson, Minister of Education, grew up in a home where the father never earned more than $16.00 per week. She acquired her education through scholarships, which, by the way, are becoming more and more available to Britain's humbly born. As a fiery Member of Parliament for Jarrow during the depression, she worked for prevention of starvation among her constituents. In 1942, during the Nazi raids, she was responsible for her country's civil defense, having supervision of more than two million paid and volunteer workers.

The one said, "Well, she is spending enough time working for the Church, I hope it is worth it." The other declared, "I have been working in the Church for five years and now I'm going to take a rest." In speaking to his servants in September of 1831, the Lord said: Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundations of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great. Behold, the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind; and the willing and obedient shall eat the good of the land of Zion in these last days (Doc. And Cov. 64:33-34)- One of the most potent forces which a mother possesses in influencing the lives of her children to righteousness is the power of example which she sets her children by her daily living. She may not fully realize this as she lives out her crowded days, but when a beloved mother passes on to her reward, the memories of her which live on with her children and are treasured by them in the long days of separation, are the memories of the deeds of loving service she showered on her family at all times, and the innumerable acts of kindness and service she rendered those outside her own home circle. Her children recall the tedious hours she was wont to spend in making quilts, in cutting out and Page 38 preparing intricate patterns to be appliqued on the quilts on sewing day in Relief Society, and the hours of service she gave after the meeting, in finishing the quilts. They remember the times when she left her home to minister to the sick or visit with the homebound. They picture the happy afternoon socials she gave for a group of lonely sisters far from their families and homelands, and the remembrance of their smiling faces floods back to bring enrichment to the souls of her children. The picture also comes to their minds of that same mother dressed in a beautiful evening gown as she left home to enjoy an evening in the home of friends. This picture, also, provides a fond memory, but does not carry the power to move her children to better or nobler living, as do the memories of the deeds of personal kindness she extended to others. The pleasure of the one is transitory?as was the occasion to the recipient?while the recollection of. The blessings she bestowed on the less fortunate of her friends lives on in the memory, and is nourished by the heartfelt words of appreciation for their mother which are spoken to them by others for years to come. "Be not weary in well-doing," admonished the Lord. Do not labor unselfishly for others for a few months or even years and then decide that one has served long EDITORIAL enough, turning thereafter to the pursuit of one's own pleasure, and leaving to those who do not weary in well-doing future service for others. The benefits of such selfish living "shall melt away as the hoar frost melteth before the burning rays of the sun." Blessed is the child who, in later years, has an anchor to his soul and an example to follow in the remembrance of the life led by his mother ?of a mother who extended her love to draw into the warmth of her friendship the poor, the lonely, and the friendless, who freely, throughout her entire life, gave of her own talents for the upbuilding of the Church she loved beyond all else. 2 And just as sure as one renders service to others, so sure will be the rewards which will follow. "Cast thy bread upon the waters; for thou shalt find it after many days," said Ecclesiastes. "The Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind," we of this day have been told with the promise, "and the willing and obedient shall eat the good of the land of Zion in these last days." Certainly, to the mothers of Zion, one of the "good" things of the land of Zion for the willing and obedient will be the joy of seeing their children following their example, working in the Church, and not becoming weary in well-doing. M. C. S. Howard S McDonald inaugurated President of Brigham Young University Wednesday, November 14, 1945, Howard S. McDonald was inaugurated president of Brigham Young University. Against a background of snow-clad peaks, the academic procession marched across the upper campus and entered the stately Joseph Smith Memorial Hall for the traditional ceremony. The principal address, delivered by Dr. Edwin A. Lee, dean of the school of education of the University of California at Los Angeles, stressed the theme?"The Glory of God Is Intelligence'"?and urged the young people of today to develop spirituality and brotherhood. Elder J. Reuben Clark of the First Presidency, in giving the charge to President McDonald, emphasized the fact that spiritual values must always take precedence over secular values, for the spiritual life is based upon eternal truth. President McDonald, in accepting this charge, said that he visioned the Bigham Young University as a great institution with students from all sections of the earth coming to learn the teachings of their Church as well as to acquire knowledge in the regular academic field. Relief Society women throughout the Church are grateful for the establishment of the Brigham Young University and for the great and good men who have been called to guide its work. We are grateful that many of us and our sons and daughters have been privileged to partake of the spirituality and the vision which have characterized our Church university. President Belle S. Spafford represented the Relief Society at the inaugural ceremonies. 40 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?JANUARY 1946 Blanche B. Stoddard Resigns as General Secretary-Treasurer THE General Board wishes to express appreciation for the faithful and devoted service of Blanche Black Stoddard as General Secretary-Treasurer from May 22 to October 31, 1945. Because of increased home responsibilities, Sister Stoddard found it necessary to be relieved of the exacting duties of the secretarial office. However, she will continue to serve the Society as a member of the General, Board, where her devotion to Relief Society work, her charming personality, and her gift for leadership will be of great value to the women of the Church. For a biographical sketch and a photograph of Blanche Black Stoddard, see the Magazine for July 1945, page 403. In Memoriam Elder Joseph J Cannon and Elder Burton K. Farnsworth HE members of Relief Society throughout the Church pay tribute at this time to the service and accomplishments of two outstanding leaders?the counselors in the superintendency of the Y. M. M.1. A. Elder Joseph J. Cannon, first assistant general superintendent, died at his home in Salt Lake City, November 4, 1945, after an illness of several weeks. Throughout his life Elder Cannon was an ardent Church worker, serving as a missionary in Sweden, editor of the Millennial Star, superintendent of the Ensign Stake Y. M. M. LA., president of the British Mission, president of the Temple Square Mission, editor of the Deseret News, and author of religious dramas, and in 1937 he was appointed first counselor in the general superintendency of the Y. M. M. I. A.. Members of the Relief Society will remember Elder Cannon particularly for his excellent reports on general conference sessions which have appeared from time to time in the Magazine. The sisters of Relief Society extend love and sympathy to Sister Cannon who assembles the interesting department, "Woman's Sphere." Elder Burton K. Farnsworth, second assistant in the general superintendency of the Y. M. M. LA., passed away October 27, 1945, in Seattle, Washington, where he had gone to attend an M. I. A. Convention. Elder Farnsworth was a loving father, an effective teacher, a dynamic leader, and an exemplar of the work and the faith of the Church. Born in Beaver, Utah, of pioneer parents, he became interested in education at an early age, secured his Ph. D. From the University of California, and became one of Utah's leading school officials and Church executives. We extend to Sister Farnsworth and the family our deepest sympathy in their loss, and our appreciation for the good life of this Latter-day Saint leader. Notes to the field Only One Relief Society General Conference To Be Held Each Year THE General Board announces, as of January 1946, the discontinuance of the custom of holding two general Relief Society conferences each year. Beginning with the year 1946, only one general Relief Society conference will be held a year.
This action has been taken because it is deemed inadvisable to require the sisters to leave their homes and to spend the necessary money to make two yearly trips to Salt Lake City in the interest of Relief Society, as it is felt that the program for the conference can be so arranged that all needed instructions for departmental work and recommendations in all phases of Relief
Society work can be given at one general conference a year.
Since the educational program of Relief Society commences each October and ends the last of May and Relief Society activities are modified in the summer months, it has been decided to hold the general Relief Society conference each year, beginning with 1946, in October?just prior to the semi-annual general conference of the Church.
In view of the fact that hereafter only one general Relief Society conference will be held a year, it is expected that Relief Society officers will put forth every effort to be present at the October annual Relief Society general conference.
Relief Society Assigned Evening Meeting of Fast Sunday In March
THE Sunday night meeting to be held on Fast Day in March 1946 has been assigned by the First Presidency for use by the Relief Society.
Suggestive plans for this evening meeting are being prepared by the
General Board and will be sent to the stakes in bulletin form.
It is suggested that ward Relief Society presidents confer with their bishops at once in regard to the conducting of this meeting by the Relief Society.Page 41 1. EDITORIAL POLICY a. Suggestions to Contributors We reserve the right to edit all accepted manuscripts according to the needs of the Magazine. Where the changes are slight, the contributor will not be contacted regarding them. However, where more important changes may be necessary, the author will be consulted whenever this is possible. We do not solicit reprints and we publish material of this type only by special arrangements. Therefore, do not send us material of any kind which has been published or is in the hands of a publisher. Payments are made on publication and, due to overstocked files, no promises can be made as to when accepted manuscripts will be published. If an author wishes to have a manuscript, which has been accepted and is being held for publication, returned, he should request this to be done and enclose postage for return of the manuscript. Seasonal material should reach us four to six months prior to publication date. We cannot offer detailed criticism of rejected manuscripts. 2. PREPARATION OF MANUSCRIPTS a. WE. Manuscripts should be typed (double-spaced) on one side only of regulation 8 1/2"x11" paper. Authors are asked to retain carbon copies of all manuscripts submitted to The Relief Society Magazine.. For submitting manuscripts it is convenient for authors to use envelopes of two sizes, the larger envelope for the outgoing manuscript and the smaller envelope, bearing the writer's name and address, for return in case the manuscript is not accepted. Envelopes designated in the stationer's trade as No. 8 and No. 9g are suitable for poems and short manuscripts. For stories and longer articles 6"x9" and 6 1/2?x9 1/2" envelopes may be used.. Adequate postage should be provided for both outgoing and return envelopes. Manuscripts, which must always be sent first class, require (for the United States, Canada, and Mexico) three cents for each ounce or fraction thereof.. Correct spelling, paragraphing, and punctuation are definite aids in the acceptance of a manuscript. All factual material should be carefully checked for accuracy. Page 42 3. CURRENT NEEDS a. Stories, preferably short stories between 1500 and 3,000 words. Serials of eight to ten chapters of about 2,000 words each. For serials, submit at first only chapters one and two and an outline of the remainder. B. Articles, from 500 to 1500 words. Material should follow a definite outline with an interesting beginning and a logical sequence. C. Poetry, of definite pattern in stanza, form, and meter. Since many of our poems are used as fillers, we can more readily accept short poems (4-12 lines) than longer contributions. The use of archaic words, inversions, and contractions should be avoided. D. Photographs, glossy black and white, size 8"x10", suitable for cover or frontispiece. I KNOW A ROAD Violet Harris Hendrickson I know a road Running straight and true, Like a ribbon Through towering pines. It goes to the east To meet the sun, And west, Where the day's death shines. A high straight road In the mountain tops Where the air Is clean and clear, Where pine-fingers point To a cobalt sky And heaven itself Seems near. A Christmas-tree lane Under shining peaks With never a twist Nor bend Where, after its toiling And climbing, It leads us To journey's end. SUGGESTIONS TO CONTRIBUTORS 43 And For Eternity Olive Woolley Burt CHAPTER VIII SYNOPSIS Delsa Marriott, trying to find a way to make her friends think that she is the one who has broken her engagement to Hugh Temple, who has asked to be released so that he can marry an Australian girl, shows an interest in Alec Windsor, a marine on furlough in the town. But when Alec asks Delsa to marry him, she remembers that he thinks of marriage as for time, only, while to her it means a contract for time and for eternity. Jeff Holden, the father of two children, has told Delsa he loves her, but she thinks he is merely lonely for his dead wife. WHEN Delsa awoke the next morning, her purpose had crystallized. Without knowing just how she had arrived at her decision, she nevertheless was absolutely sure of what she had to do. It had happened, I've grown up!" she thought to herself, smiling a little wistfully in remembrance of the girl who had ridden off yesterday morning?the girl who was going to cling to her childhood sweetheart in spite of everything. But when her ringless hand reached for the hairbrush and she Page 44 realized what it meant and what she would have to do today, she hesitated. But only fora moment. Shaking herself as she might shake a reluctant child, she thought, Be adult, Delsa! If you are ever going to do it, do it now?make a clean, sharp break and have it over with. Later she added softly, "Hugh will come back here with his wife and you can have his friendship, sweet and whole, if you do the right thing now. And if you never find the man with whom you wish to live forever and ever and ever?why, that is just your bad luck, Delsa." She dressed carefully, wanting to look her best today, not wanting anyone to feel sorry for her or to think she was unhappy. She went blithely down the stairs, finding that she was not having to act?that she really felt happiness through her whole body since she had come to her decision. She was reaching for the cream when her mother noticed her bare finger. "Delsa!" she cried, "your ring! You'll lose it if you keep taking it off and laying it around." Delsa smiled at her mother. "I've taken it off for good, Mother," she said quietly. "I am not going to put it on again." Her mother looked at her with stricken eyes. "Delsa, you haven't let a passing fancy?" Delsa felt her father regarding AND FOR ETERNITY her, and she turned her eyes to him. "It is not like you to jest about such things, Daughter," he said, and a worried question was behind his words. "I'm not jesting. I've thought it all out. Listen, Mother, Dad. When Hugh wrote to me last, he asked me to release him from his promise. He wants to marry an Australian girl he's met and fallen in love with. I thought at first I couldn't?" Her mother rose quickly and came around the table to her. "Darling!" she said. "I felt something was wrong. Why didn't you tell me? Hugh can't be serious! Oh, we'll work this out!" Delsa smiled reassuringly. "I've already worked it out, Mother," she said. "As I said, at first I thought I couldn't bear to give Hugh up. I was thinking, I know, more of what everyone would say than I was of my own loss. But now I see that Hugh is right to ask for his freedom if he wants it." "But how can he want it?" her father asked indignantly. ''After all these years, after all we've done for him. He must have gone crazy down there!" "He was lonely, no doubt," Delsa defended, "and he needed someone right there, someone real that he could touch and love. But there's more to it than that, Dad. Hugh was just a boy when he went away? I was just a girl. He's grown up since he left, and now that he's a man, he's chosen someone else." "Delsa, how can you defend him?" her mother asked. "As if you couldn't make a grown man a wife. You've grown up, too. You'd be a suitable mate?" "Yes," Delsa said thoughtfully, and "I?ve grown up, too. And that's why I see Hugh's point of view." SHE paused. It was proving to be difficult, all right, but not in the way she had thought. They just couldn't understand, that was all. And they must understand; they must still love Hugh. She tried, "You must think of Hugh as a man, Dad?a man _ far away from Utah and from the things he has always known and the things he has always planned. As an independent adult he has found that the things he wanted as a boy are not the things he wants right now. We must understand that, and grant Hugh the right to do as he sees fit." "Not when it means throwing you over after he has asked you to marry him!" her father cried indignantly. "Not if it means breaking your heart, leaving you to be a spinster?" "My heart is not broken, Father, and if I am a spinster, it will be my fault, not Hugh's." Her mother shook her head sadly. "You don't realize what you are saying, what you are doing when you release Hugh, Delsa. 'Think it over; let's talk it over some more before you do anything. His mother can't know?" "Not yet. Hugh said for me to break the news any way I wished. I am going to tell Aunt Martha today ?and anyone else who cares to know about it, or has a right to know," she added. They looked at her sadly, at a loss what to do when she seemed so calm, so decisive. To them she was still their little girl, capable of being hurt, and they wanted fiercely to protect her. But they loved Hugh, too, be- 46 yond the ordinary love for a neighbor's child who has grown up almost in the family. Delsa came around the table, put an arm around each of her parents, and bent and kissed them gently. "It's all might, dears," she whispered. "You'll see! I must run now, or I'll be late for Sunday School." As she came to the corner of the street on which the church house stood she met Jeff Holden, carrying Trudy and with Davy running like a young colt at his side. When Davy saw Delsa he let out a whoop and ran toward her, his chubby arms outstretched. He flung himself against her knees, crying "Delsa! Delsa!" Trudy held out her baby arms and said, "Della!" They all laughed, but Delsa noticed at once that Jeff's laugh was not as clear and gay as it usually was. He's tired, she thought, and reproached herself for not having gone over the day before to help him with the children. Delsa took one of Davy's hands - and they started down the street together. Suddenly Delsa was aware that Jeff's eyes were on her hand?the hand that held Davy's, and she remembered that Hugh's ring was no longer there. She looked straight at Jeff. "Hugh has asked me to release him from our engagement, Jeff," she said quietly. EFF did not answer at once, and Delsa saw a shadow cross his clear gray eyes. Then he turned his eyes away and walked on, in silence. "What's the matter?" Delsa asked, and as Jeff did not answer she flushed RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?JANUARY 1946 and said uncomfortably, "Oh, Jeff! If you're being bothered about that nonsense you were saying the other night?forget it! I knew it didn't mean anything?it was the moonlight and the music and all?" Jeff's voice was distant as he said, making no acknowledgment of Delsa's words, "Did you have a nice ride yesterday?" For a moment Delsa was stunned with surprise and shock that Jeff, whom she had considered one of her best friends, paid no attention to an announcement fraught with so much importance to her. She stammered, "Ride? What do you mean, Jeff?" The bitterness in his voice could not be mistaken. "I saw you and Windsor ride off into the canyon and I surmised you were trying to help him enjoy his furlough?but I didn't think it would lead to the discarding of Hugh's ring and all the fine loyalty you've made such a show of!" His meaning struck her like a blow and she was furious. She dropped Davy's hand and walked ahead so swiftly that the child stumbled after her crying, "Delsa, wait for Davy!" But she didn't stop. 'Then she heard Jeff say sharply, "Come back, David. Come here!" and she felt tears sting the edge of her eyelids at the hurt in his voice. Delsa didn't give herself time to think. She went straight to her place with her class and from that moment on she was busy. Butas she followed the preliminary service, as she went with her class into their own room and directed the lesson, the ghost of a thought was moving shapeless and inarticulate through her heart. AND FOR ETERNITY She was eager for the service to be over. She wanted to go home, to get out Blue Star and ride, ride, ride, until she had thought this thing through. But it wasn't to be that easy. Delsa slipped out of the church and cut through the lot, planning to get home unseen by any of her friends, for she had no heart now to tell her news to any others. But there, as if he had read her plans, Alec stood leaning against a poplar tree, waiting for her. He came forward eagerly. "I figured you'd be hurrying home after Sunday School," he grinned, "and would take this short cut." DELSA smiled in spite of herself. He was so young, so impatient. "You figured?with Millie's help I'll bet!" she said teasingly. Alec laughed. "Nope! I figured it all alone. You were helping your ma do the washing, so I thought you'd probably help her get Sunday dinner." "And you'd probably get invited to help Dad eat it!" "Sure! Sure!" He took her arm and they walked along together. In a way, Delsa thought, it was lucky that Alec was there waiting? that he was going home with her. It kept her from thinking of what Jeff had said. If she got time to think of that, she would find out, doubtless, what the rest of the town would say once they heard. And again her old fear of being pitied, of being looked at with commiseration stirred. It would be better to marry Alec, right now, and tell them all afterward. But she was being childish 47 again?she was going back to the immature deceit of the past days?the deceit she had cast off up there on the boulder. She would take this respite that Alec offered and enjoy it?so she laughed with him and joked with him, and when he caught her paying scant attention and chided her, she laughed lightly and volunteered no excuse. She saw her mother's worried frown when she brought Alec in to dinner, and went over and put her arms about her. "I've brought Alec home to dinner, Mother," she said quietly. "He'll be a good tonic for all of us." Her father gave her a sharp look as if to say, "You can put off reckoning for a time, my dear, but it will come." The meal, in spite of this, was gay with banter and laughter. Delsa was sure that Alec had noticed that she had not put Hugh's ring on again and that he was taking this as a tacit acknowledgment of his own candidacy for the place Hugh had once held. But she wouldn't let that worry her. After dinner Hugh's mother came in and Delsa was glad that Alec insisted that her mother sit with Mrs. Temple while he and Delsa did the dishes. Now Hugh's mother would not notice her ringless finger for awhile. Delsa shrank from telling her what Hugh had done, even though she knew this task must sooner or later be faced. Now in the kitchen with Alec, she tried to forget all the unpleasant aspects of being jilted, and to concentrate only on the happier ones. She was free now to look at Alec with affection, even with love, if she 
chose. 48 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?JANUARY 1946 She was free to accept his kisses, if they were the kisses she wanted. She was free as she had never in all her life before been free, because always before Hugh had laid first claim on her thoughts and her affection.
She was a little giddy with this new freedom and a little panic with the worry she wouldn't admit, so that she laughed too quickly and too often, and Alec saw that she was not calm and composed.
He put his arms around her.
"The symbol of the pledge is gone, Delsa, darling! darling!" he whispered. "What does that mean, dearest? What does it mean?"
She felt his strong, young heart beating against her cheek. She thought, I can let him believe I am in love with him?maybe I am! I can let him think that is why I took off Hugh's ring!
She said softly, "Oh, Alec, it doesn't mean anything except that Hugh has asked me to take it off."
ALEC drew back from her. He took her shoulders in his hands and turned her towards the light so that he could look into her face.
"Do you mean you are really free, Delsa? But how? When?" He was almost incredulous.
"A long time ago," Delsa said wearily. "A long time ago."
"But yesterday you said?"
"I said that the ring was the symbol of a pledge. When you suggested taking it off, throwing it away, I saw suddenly that that was all I had to do?"
"But why hadn't you done that before, if he asked you so long ago?"
"Oh, it was really only a few days
ago," Delsa said softly, smiling at the thought of how she had changed since that evening. "But I was afraid, Alec! I was afraid to take it off! I was afraid of what everyone would say and think. I was afraid of being left alone."
"Well, you don't need to be afraid of that any longer!" he cried and had her in his arms again.
Delsa felt like weeping. She felt as if she were his mother, and he was asking her to assure him of her love and she couldn't, and she felt that she was betraying him. She put her hands against his shoulders.
"No, Alec, no!" she cried softly.
She withdrew from the circle of his arms and stood leaning against the table, looking at him with compassion. He was so young, so alone, so defenseless against his emotions. Hugh would have been just like this?even with all the growing up the way would have given him. They were only boys! Her throat ached, and she thought, I am no older than Alec, really! It must be that my heart has grown old suddenly!
Alec stood looking at her, leaning toward her in that slanting, eager way of his, his brown eyes troubled at her mood.
She stepped forward and put her hands on his arm and raised her eyes to his face.
"Don't be troubled, Alec!" she begged. "I don't know which way I'm going yet. All I want is happiness for you and for Hugh and for all this troubled, crazy, reeling world. But I don't know which way happiness lies?for anyone?just now."
She felt the tears heavy on her lashes, and suddenly she was the little one, turning to lay her head against him and weep as only a child can weep.
Alec put his arms about her and held her gently, tenderly.
"There, little girl!" he whispered against her hair. "I'm clumsy and thoughtless, ruining you like this. Forgive me. I just get panicky when I think how little time there is. But dry your eyes and forget it! We'll go slow, sweetheart. We'll take it easy. Don't cry, kid!"
She felt it crazy desire to laugh at
that, but she saw that he was in desperate earnest?he was the strong one, the adult one, the protector?and she shook her head, wondering that he could be so naive.
She turned back to the neglected dishes, and as she dipped her hands into the suds she felt a little chill of fear and shuddered. Maybe my heart is really dead! she thought, and began to wash plates vigorously to hide her fright.

MESSAGES FROM THE MISSIONS New England Mission MYRTLE BERNARDS, auxiliary supervisor of the New England Mission, reports: "In October of 1944 the Relief Society in the Providence Branch was discontinued because of the lack of members. Three families had moved to Salt Lake City and one to Mississippi. Since the first of the year, however, membership in the branch increased by the baptism of converts and other members moving in. The Relief Society was reopened in March with Sister Alice Lyon as president. One of the rooms in the branch chapel wasn't being used so the new Relief Society made their first project the redecorating of this room for their own use.. "The priesthood members replastered the walls and the Relief Society carried on from there. They had the floors covered with a dark green linoleum, painted the walls and woodwork and made curtains and drapes for the windows. The Providence chapel at one time had been used as a theater and the stage curtains had been left. These curtains were made up into drapes for all the windows in the chapel. This first project has been completed and the members of the Relief Society now have a lovely place to meet in Page 50 and carry on their regular outlined work. The priesthood members of the branch have recently completed a baptismal font and are now beautifying the grounds. On work nights the Relief Society sisters cook dinner at the chapel so the brethren may come right from their work, have dinner, and work outside around the chapel while it is still light. The Relief Society of this branch has greatly helped to increase activity and unity." Eastern States Mission ALBERTA O. DOXEY, president of the Eastern States Mission Relief Society, reports: "I have been able to visit a few of the branches of the mission and on these occasions I have found the sisters laboring under great difficulties due to scattered membership and scarcity of gasoline to reach meeting places but carrying on just the same, and their devotion to duty and accomplishments has indeed been inspiring. Many of our members are actively participating in some war service along with their Relief Society work and we have one member, a widow and officer in the Princeton Branch Relief Society, who has just donated her ninth pint of blood to the American Red Cross. BUFFALO BRANCH RELIEF SOCIETY, EASTERN STATES MISSION, CHRISTMAS TOY DISPLAY Photograph submitted by Alberta O. Doxey, President Eastern States Mission Relief Society 52 Some notable accomplishments of some of our branches follow: "The small branch Relief Society at Newburgh, New York, with five active members, sponsored a bazaar on April 14, 1944, which netted a clear profit of $80.75 through the sale of refreshments and many beautiful articles made by the hands of these few sisters. "On August 24, the Altoona Branch Relief Society, with a total of seven active members, held a rummage sale which made a net profit of $61.49. All of the goods sold was donated by members and it was felt that the sale was a success in view of the amount made and the fact that only two months preparation was given to it. "The Buffalo Branch Relief Society had a notable project in September. It was decided that because of the scarcity and poor quality of toys that would be available, the branch Relief Society would make Christmas toys. As a result of many hours of work, quite a collection of adorable stuffed animals, some attractive bean bags, rag dolls, and the beginnings of drums, sets of blocks, costume jewelry for the older girls, scrap books, and other such things were made. Because of the infantile paralysis epidemic in Buffalo, the Crippled Children's Guild Hospital was overcrowded and _ it was thought it would be best to remember these children with the toys. Therefore, 130 separate toys and gifts were made and wrapped and most of them delivered to the children's ward of the Meyer Memorial Hospital on December 23. The remainder of the toys were distributed to the children of the Buffalo Branch at the annual Christmas RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?JANUARY 1946 party on Saturday evening, December 23, 1944. (See picture on preceding page. ) "Another project of interest was that of the Lancaster Branch Relief Society which gathered 106 articles of clothing and packed them and sent them to war refugees.: "In Syracuse, New York, the Syracuse Branch Relief Society held its annual bazaar on November 14. The Fulton, New York, Branch Relief Society joined with a booth of handiwork, as well as food. Such articles as hand-embroidered and crocheted linen of various descriptions were on sale, as well as pies, cakes, cookies, hot dogs, sweet cider, and homemade candy. A fish pond provided entertainment for adults and children as well. Though none of these sisters had ever made or worked on a quilt before, the beautifully appliqued quilt which they had ready for the bazaar sold for $26. The total proceeds from the bazaar amounted to $63.03. "The Philadelphia Branch Relief Society, with an active membership of ten, held a bazaar on December g which was well attended by the branch membership. The entertainment provided by the missionaries laboring in the mission office was especially enjoyable. A profit of $87.12 was realized." Northwestern States Mission HEA STOTT, counselor in the Golden Ridge Branch Relief Society, Great Falls District, reports as follows: "The Golden Ridge Relief Society, consisting of fifteen members, under the able leadership of Sister Armida Hanberg, president, has sponsored two outstanding NOTES FROM THE FIELD entertainments during the 1944-45 season. "A bazaar was sponsored in November. Articles were donated by members and some non-members. The Relief Society collected rags and prepared them for rugs at work meetings. Fourteen rugs were woven and sold at the bazaar. Materials for a quilt were donated by some of the members. It was quilted at work meetings and also sold at the bazaar. When all expenses were paid a profit of $163 was made. "On March 17 the organization sponsored the Annual Day entertainment. A delicious banquet, furnished by the members, was served on a_ beautifully decorated table. The table was arranged with candles, place cards, napkins and favors to carry out the Relief Society colors, blue and gold. All members and partners were in attendance. A dance was enjoyed after the banquet." Australian Mission GERTRUDE SHIRRA, counselor in the Brisbane Branch Relief Society, Queensland, Australia, writes: "Far away here in sunny Queensland we Relief Society sisters wish to express our appreciation to the General Board for the excellent suggestion of a patriotic program honoring our boys in the services, their mothers, wives and children. On Sunday, July 27, 1943, we celebrated our Society's twelfth anniversary by staging this patriotic program in the evening's meeting. "The church was suitably decorated with American and British flags. The congregation sang, "The Star Spangled Banner," and 53 ?National Anthem." The foreword and conclusion were given by Sister Irene Boulton in patriotic costume. A talk was given by Sister May Sharman on 'Our Boys as Missionary Soldiers.' A chorus, 'Lest We Forget,' was rendered by the Singing Mothers and daughters. "A Salute to the Flag," by two boy scouts. All servicemen present and wives and mothers of those away were then honored and had patriotic ribbons pinned on them. "After a talk by Sister Gertrude Shirra on 'Our Church Stands Ever Ready to Defend the Cause of Freedom,' the congregation joined in singing "Victory Hymn.' "Community hymn _ singing. Which, as a regular feature for the entertainment of our visiting servicemen, follows each Sunday night's service, was then enjoyed, as were also refreshments. Lights were turned out and twelve candles were lit on a three-tiered birthday cake made and donated by Sister Ida Parker. Our president, Sister Harriet Dean, then blew out the candles successfully in one breath and our eldest member of the Relief Society, Sister Anna Gilbert, seventy-six, came forward and cut the cake which was passed to all. "We truly felt our efforts were immeasurably compensated. "Similarly, we celebrated our 13th anniversary and we acclaim both patriotic evenings as memorable occasions. "With Sister Harriet Dean, Sister Ethel Orth, and myself as a presidency, we are extremely happy to' mention that love and unity and enthusiasm pervade all our meetings and because of this we are truly grateful to our loving Father in 54 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?JANUARY 1946 MEXICAN MISSION RELIEF SOCIETY President Mary D. Pierce and six Relief Society branch presidents. Antonia Cardenas, Ermita Branch, Mexico City; Salome Flores, San Pedro right: Left to Branch, Federal District; Lucia Morales, Cuautla Branch, State of Morelos; President Mary Done Pierce; Jovita Bravo, Santiago Branch, State of Hidalgo; America Tapia, Toluca Branch, State of Mexico; Clementina Esperon Juarez, Tierra Blanca Branch, State of Veracruz. Heaven who sheds his spirit upon us so bountifully." Mexican Mission "THE following is a report from the Mexican Mission by Sister Mary D. Pierce, president: "The regular semi-annual conference of the Mexican Mission was held May 18, 19, and 20. This year an exposition was held of work completed by the members of our mission in Relief Societies and in their homes. A medium-sized room of the chapel was filled with the articles brought in. Several quilts covered one wall, and the other three were covered by a variety of articles. There were lace tablecloths, embroidery work on towels, pillowcases, luncheon cloths, etc., drawn work, dolls, a child's crocheted dress, and a yellow organdy formal. On a table in the center of the room was a miniature plush living room set, several artificial flowers, a pair of leather gloves and a carved wooden plaque, tinted, of the Prophet Joseph Smith, made by one of the brethren. 'There was also a wall plaque of plaster that was very pretty "Immediately after the second session of the conference, everyone was invited to see the exposition, and a demonstration was given by Sister Pauline Green, under the direction of Sister Mary D. Pierce, NOTES FROM THE FIELD The members were shown how to cover the end of a quilt, so as to be -able to keep it clean longer. Sister Green also told them how to wash a quilt to get the best results. A demonstration was then given on how to paint cloth with crayolas and keep the color in, even after washing. This is very simple and easy to do, and you can make very pretty curtains, bedspreads, etc. With it. Each member was then given printed instructions on how to make pot holders, and two types of aprons that are especially useful. They were also shown the finished articles. "The demonstration ended with Sister Pierce telling the members that the project for the Relief Society this coming year is to have every family in the mission supplied with the number of quilts they need. "The exposition itself continued until the end of the conference. It was a real success, and if the members express a desire for it, we plan on having another one next conference." The mission further reports: "In one of the smaller branches of the Mexican Mission which is located in Atlixco, Puebla, a tiny Indian town about eighty-five miles southwest of Mexico City, a handful of faithful Mexican sisters carry on the regular Relief Society lesson work and activity. A typical example of their work is the special program which was held a short time ago in commemoration of the organization 55 of the Relief Society, March 17, 1842. Sister Mary D. Pierce reports that on the evening of March 19 a special celebration was held at the home of one of the members to which all of their husbands were also invited. "A play was presented centered about the lives of the six Relief Society presidents and each Mexican sister taking part gave a short sketch of the life and activities of one of the presidents. Two recitations and a song then were given with a short skit on temperance ending the program. Ice cream and cookies were served to those present. "The entire program was very simple and unelaborate, but it demonstrates that even among those of humble birth and little or no formal education, the Relief Society can go forward in the true spirit of our Church and carry on activities in which the whole group participates. The sisters of the Atlixco Branch, several of whom do not know how to read nor write, are all very poor and their lives are not much affected by this modern world, but they all joined together in planning and taking part in an evening of enjoyable entertainment in honor of the organization to which they belong. A detailed report of this program was sent in to Sister Pierce at the mission home in Mexico City by Sister Concepcion de Lara, Relief Society president in Atlixco." Lesson DEPARTMENT Theology Church History Lesson 15?The United Order Begun and Its Establishment in the Settlements Dr. H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, April 2, 1946 Objective: To show how the Lord strives always to have his children seek the more perfect social order of living. THE gospel of Jesus Christ has been sent to the earth for the salvation of mankind. In many cases the saints, and more especially people of the world, have felt that this salvation is meant only for happiness hereafter. While no one can deny that it is the joy of eternal peace that is the ultimate goal of living, yet to insure such a hope it is necessary to labor for salvation in this mortal existence. Such being the case, anything, then, that blights and dwarfs our living here should be alleviated. Sick men cannot work. Poverty-stricken people have no spirit to do, nor can those who are trapped in the wages of sin find joy in future living. The Lord would stamp out all things that shackle the souls of men. This, of course, can only be done when men co-operate. The Lord can show the way, but if the benefits of his counsel are to be realized, his children must learn to listen and obey. Page 56 One of the first things the Master taught the early members of his Church was the need for working together. They were to share, as a group, the sorrows as well as the joys. There would always be poor among them. Just as sure as the rising sun, disappointments and reverses would always be a part of this life, and suffering would come as a result. The widow and the fatherless, the invalid and the weak, all must be assisted. The human heart is tender and the human soul has pride. Both of these must be considered even above the immediate relief of physical want. If they are not, the spirit and will to rise above difficulties breaks, leaving often but the shell of man, the outward form bereft of the divine light of his inner spirit. Few sights are more heart-rending LESSON DEPARTMENT than those to be viewed upon the park benches of great cities?human driftwood, cut free from the moorings of purpose in life. In his wisdom the Lord knows that there can be no true salvation for his people unless the evils of poverty and destitution can be controlled. This was the reason that, in the very beginning of the establishment of his Church in the latter days, he tried to bring about what is known as the law of the United Order or consecration of properties, To fully understand this law and its far-reaching effects swells the heart with love and kindness, for what greater joy is given man than to know he is of worth to others? You will recall that the Prophet Joseph Smith, before the fatal return to Nauvoo, said: "If my life is of no value to my friends, it is of none to While, as a People, the saints of early days were not quite equal to the responsibility of accepting this higher law of social living, still it has not all been loss to know of their failure. "A man's Teach should exceed his grasp, else what's a heaven for," writes the poet, Robert Browning. The lesson for this month can have but little in the way of history in a few communities in the far west, such as Orderville in Southern Utah. - in practice, the brethren in Missouri got away, in their attempts to set up the United Order, from the principles set out 57 in the revelations. This is also true of the organizations set up here in Utah after the saints came to the valleys. I the departure came by way of the nature of the title which was given to the Church and of the title which was reconveyed to the donor?in Practice it was a sort of "Tend-lease arrangement" as finally developed. The revelations and the instructions of the Prophet called for a fee simple conveyance of real estate by the donor to the bishop and an absolute bill of sale of the personal property of the donor also to the bishop. The bishop then granted back to the donor by the same sort of documents the donor's 'portion,' 'stewardship,' or ' inheritance.' In the Orderville experiment a regular communal organization apparently was set up and all property held in common. The Prophet Joseph had time and time again declared that the Church was not a communal organization. On one occasion, while attending a lecture on socialism, he declared, "I said I did not believe the doctrine." This was in 1843. ? ?President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. Today on a Church-wide scale we may be nearing something of a United Order under the present Welfare Plan. Says President J. Reuben Clark, Jr.: Perhaps... When the Welfare Plan gets thoroughly into operation... We shall not be so very far from Carrying out the great fundamentals of the United Order, If the Welfare Plan is fully operative, we shall be able to care for every destitute Latterday Saint wherever he may be (Conference Address, 1942).  The law of consecration or the United Order is not, as some have supposed, a law doing away with Private Ownership. On the contrary, under this law each family in the Church would legally own enough Property to satisfy "his family, according to his circumstances and his wants and needs, inasmuch as his wants are just?" (Doc. And Coy, 58 82:17; 78:5-8). This would mean that the amount of property. Owned by the various families in the Church would of necessity vary since the needs of families are different. There would be equality, however, in that all families would have their needs. When the Prophet Joseph Smith was asked if the Mormon people believed in having all things in common his answer was "No." (D. H. C.. Vol. III, p. 28) In order to understand the true spirit of the law of the United Order it must be understood that basically all that we are and have really belongs to the Lord. He, therefore, can call upon us for our property as well as our lives since both are his in the first place (Doc. And Cov. 104: 14-17, 47-57). The amount of a man's property which should be retained by the Church and the amount he should receive back was to be determined as follows, as presented by the Prophet in a letter dated June 25, 1833 and addressed to Edward Partridge: "I proceed to answer your questions, concerning the consecration of property:? First, it is not right to condescend to very great particulars in taking inventories. The fact is this, a man is bound by the law of the Church, to consecrate to the Bishop, before he can be considered a legal heir to the kingdom of Zion; and _ this, too, without constraint; and unless he does this, he cannot be acknowledged before the Lord on the Church books: therefore, to condescend to particulars, I will tell you that every man must be his own judge how much he should receive and how much he should suffer to remain in the hands of the Bishop. I speak of those who consecrate more than they need for the' support of themselves and their families. "The matter of consecration must be done by the mutual consent of both parties; for to give the Bishop power to say how much every man shall have, and he be obliged to comply with the Bishop's judgment, is giving to the Bishop more RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?JANUARY 1946 power than a king has; and upon the other hand, to let every man say how much he needs, and the Bishop be obliged to comply with his judgment, is to throw Zion into confusion, and make a slave of the Bishop. The fact is, there must be a balance or equilibrium of power between the Bishop and the people, and thus harmony and goodwill may be preserved among you. "Therefore, those persons consecrating property to the Bishop in Zion, and then receiving an inheritance back, must reasonably show to the Bishop that they need as much as they claim. But in case the two parties cannot come to a mutual agreement, the Bishop is to have nothing ~ to do about receiving such consecrations; and the case must be laid before a council of twelve High Priests, the Bishop not being one of the council, but he is to lay the case before them." (Doc. Hist. 364- 65)?President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. When the parties reached an agreement, then the bishop would deed in fee simple the property agreed upon to the Church member. This the member would own outright as private property. The part of the member's property which was not turned back to him after these transactions had been made then became the common property of the Church to be used for the support of the poor in the Church. If a whole community of saints would thus comply with the law of the United Order there would be a feeling of equality among them, for all having been fair at first declaring their earthly possessions, they might by the same token feel free to call upon the bishop's store in time of need. The bishop, in tum, would be in the best position to administer such a "residue" of property (Doc. And Cov. 42:34-36), since he and his community would know that all had complied legally with the law of the Lord. Thus each saint would LESSON DEPARTMENT have his "Portion" or "Inheritance" from the common pool of properties or land first deeded to the Churchy. It was within the very first years of the Church that the Lord commanded his saints to obey the law of the United Order. By February of 1831, a number of the new converts had assembled in and about Kirtland, Ohio. It was the will of the Lord to have the members of the Church in New York assemble in Ohio. There would of necessity need to be preparations made for these people. Accordingly, Bishop Partridge was instructed to assign them lands after their arrival. At this time, the law of consecration was set into effect. The head of each family after having turned in his property was, in turn, issued a certificate for his portion and inheritance in the Church. Trouble came soon after this law went into effect since not all group played fair, The members of the Church from Colesville, New York, on their arrival in Ohio, were located at a place called Thompson, about sixteen miles northwest of Kirtland. Here, as we have learned, they were directed to live according to the Lord's law, that is, the order of stewardship and consecration of properties. Among these people there resided a man named Leman Copley, who was a member of the 'Shaking Quakers' before he joined the Church. He owned a large tract of land which he agreed to turn over to the Colesville branch to occupy in this manner of stewardship, agreeable with the revelation they had received. It appears that Copley had not been fully converted to the Gospel and he, with some others, later rebelled and broke the covenant of consecration. This caused confusion among the Colesville saints and placed them at the mercy of their enemies, as well as in jeopardy before the Lord. In their distress they sent Knight, who was in charge of the branch at Thompson, to the Prophet to learn what they should do. The Lord spoke unto them saying that their covenant had been broken and therefore was of no effect, and it would have been better for the one who was responsible for the offense, 'had he been drowned in the depth of the sea.' The members of the branch were now commanded to journey to Missouri, unto the borders of the Lamanites,' and there they were to seek 'a living like unto men' until the Lord might prepare a place for them (Essentials in Church History, page 127).  The Stories of other attempts to live the law of United Order are not unlike this one as to the Outcome some d e the Saints at times succeeded, but as a group they seemed not ready to comply with the will of the Lord in these matters. Today, with so many schemes abroad as to the best solution for a perfect social order, we as members of the Church might well look into the Lord's words and learn his will as did the people of Enoch. Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggestive readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part of the text to discover wherein we must "give heed unto his word." 1 . "And all things shall be done by common consent in the Church . . ." (Doc. and Cov. 26:2). What does this mean? Note pages 178-179 following Sec. 26 in the Commentary. 2. Is a person disloyal to the government who acknowledges God as the supreme ruler? (Read Doc. and Cov. 58:21-22) For further class discussion or home study on the United Order read, "Private Ownership Under the United Order" by President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., Conference Address, October 1942; see also Improvement Era, November 1942.

Visiting Seachers' Messages Sources of Strength?Charity Lesson 7?Charity Hopeth All Things, Charity Endureth All Things Dr. Lowell L. Bennion For Tuesday, April 2, 1946 Objective: To show that charity meets offense with patience, understanding, and hope. Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you,... Do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven (Matt. 5:43-45). THIS is strong doctrine. Man seems to be more inclined by nature to give blow for blow than love for hate or good for evil. Critics and skeptics call this Christian ideal good for the kingdom of heaven, but not for this world. Still, we may ask, what does experience teach us? Not infrequently when a person is dealt with unfairly his first impulse is to fight for his rights, to rally the support of his friends, or even to return evil for evil in order to teach the offender the error of his ways. Experience reveals the folly of such a course of action, for argument only stirs more argument as the wind stirs the open fire; and evil not only increases evil, but justifies it in the mind of the first offender. A person of charity knows a better way to deal with an offense against him. Since "charity seeketh not her own," his first reaction to injury or criticism is not to engage in self-defense, but to look within himself to find the cause for the real or imagined offense. If, after making careful study and receiving wise counsel, he finds no cause within himself for the offense, then he is happy that the accusation against him is not justified. And since "'charity rejoiceth in the truth" he is willing to wait, to hope, and even to endure until truth can be his vindicator which it can be and will be far more effectively than he himself could ever be. Hardship and suffering make up a normal part of a person's life. The rains descend, the floods come, and the winds blow, and beat upon every life (See Matt. 7:24-27). Sometimes these things come upon us as
natural consequences of our own ignorance and sins; often they are 
the result of the ignorance and sins of others or of the natural conditions
of earth-life. Whatever their cause, they do not leave us untouched. One
who comes face-to-face with real struggle and suffering will never be
the same person again. Either he will increase in cynicism, bitterness,
melancholy or self-pity, or he will grow in humility, compassion, understanding,
and love. It isn't what happens to us, and more especially what is said about us, that matters, but our attitude towards these things and toward those who offend us. Charity is an unfailing source of strength which enables us to meet
life with courage and faith, with patience, understanding, and love. It
relieves its possessor of the burden of a wounded self and of the need
to waste energy in self-excuse and self-defense, in blame, or retaliation.
It frees the mind and heart for their larger task of knowing the truth and
loving the right. Charity does not mean submission to wrong and to
error; it means more strength for the right and for the truth. LESSON DEPARTMENT
Literature The Bible in our Literature Lesson 7-Bible Influence as Revealed in Sermons Essays, and Orations. Dr. Howard R. Driggs For Tuesday, April 16, 1946 Added the treasured songs, stories, and Plays that have been created for our recreation, we have we have
a wealth of choice sermons, essays, and orations. As distinguished
from the lyric, epic, and dramatic types of literature, already presented
in these lessons, the sermon, essay, and oration are in a general sense
more didactic in purpose and spirit. They teach or portray facts and
truths of life with more directness. At times, this didactic type of literature
rises to classic heights. All Down the Stream of time men h Voiced their thoughts and feelings have voiced their thoughts and feelings have tried to do what they felt was
right. Often what was said rang with such force that it echoed and
re-echoed through the years. For illustration: We hold these truths to be Self-evident that all men are Created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. ? Declaration oi Independence, Thomas Jefferson. 62 It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us; that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion. That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain. That this nation, _ under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth. ?Gettysburg Speech, Abraham Lincoln Only great occasions bring forth such soul-stirring expressions. When a nation is at a crisis, some leader usually rises to voice the heart of the people. When truth is soundly, aptly spoken, the words are caught up and passed on as maxims for guidance, as clarion calls to duty. Usually such expressions, as the ones above, are simple,. Direct, rhythmic, easy to remember. In word or spirit, they reveal Bible inspiration. In "times that try men's souls," those who bear the responsibility of leadership, almost unfailingly turn to Holy Writ for light and strength. During Britain's darkest days of World War II, when Winston Churchill could promise his people only "blood, sweat, toil and tears," he constantly held faith and courage before them in words such as these: The task which has been set us is not beyond our strength; its pangs and toils are not beyond our endurance. As long as we have faith in our cause, and unconquerable will power, salvation will not be denied us. In the words of the Psalmist: RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?JANUARY 1946 "He shall not be afraid of evil tidings, his heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord." Later, when the clouds had lifted, he could look back through the dark days and say: All the world, even our best friends, thought that our end had come.... We were united in that solemn, majestic hour.... We faced our duty, and by the mercy of God we were preserved. Such bracing of men and women for their duties is by no means limited to times of deepest distress. In less degree it comes with everyday needs. All of us, great or small, are constantly saying things to try to help the world along. One thing that marks our daily talk is folk sayings that have come down as a homely heritage of wisdom. Everyone will recall some of these old, time-tested bits of advice that fell from the lips of grandmother, grandfather or parents, or some helpful-spirited neighbor. Here are just a few samples: Don't let the grass grow under your feet. Remember, a stitch in time saves nine. Honesty is the best policy. Handsome is as handsome does. Frequently a bit of wisdom came in verse, as: The Devil was sick?the Devil a monk would be; The Devil was well?the Devil a monk was he. ?Rabelais A goodly part of our didactic literature, indeed, is cast into verse form?this to make it easier to learn by heart. Songs sung in religious services are in large measure more didactic than lyric. A central purpose in their creation is to impress a gospel lesson. For illustration, take these typical lines: Count your many blessings Name them one by one; And it will surprise you What the Lord hath done. Let us oft speak kind words to each other, At home or where'er we may be. LESSON DEPARTMENT Poets, dramatists, novelists, frequently let life lessons flower forth in their creations. Oliver Wendell Holmes, for example, after pondering over a broken shell of a chambered. Nautilus, created a beautiful lyric on its life and growth, and closed with a message for himself and for all of us. Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul, As the swift seasons roll! Leave thy low-vaulted past! Let each new temple, nobler than the last, Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast, Till thou at length art free, Leaving thine outgrown shell by life's unresting sea! Bryant's "To a Waterfowl," in which the poet pictures a bird winging its solitary way through the sky into the night, closes with these impressive lines: He who, from zone to zone, Guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight, In the long way that I must tread alone, Will lead my steps aright. Life lessons such as these, which blossom naturally out of songs, stories or plays, are diamond truths in their settings. Our literature is sprinkled with like gems of thought ?made the more impressive because they are artistically presented. In harmony with all true teaching, they lead, guide, persuade, but do not "force the human mind." Preachers will do well to keep this basic principle, so marvelously exemplified in the life of the Master Teacher, constantly in mind. Our most effective ones do. Indirectly, rather than directly, they present 63 their lessons of life. As with the Savior, they often make the truth walk and talk through a well-told story. Occasionally when conditions demand, they speak with plainness, as did Jesus when he drove the money changers out of the temple, and when he rebuked the scribes and Pharisees. Generally, however, the approach to the hearts and minds is such that folk are stirred with the impulse not merely to be good but to do good. A few illustrations of what may be called persuasive preaching or teaching are the following: I sometimes think that we expect too much of Christmas Day. We try to crowd into it the long arrears of kindliness and humanity for the whole year. As for me, I like to take my Christmas a little at a time, all through the year. And thus I drift along into the holidays?let them overtake me unexpectedly?waking up some fine morning and suddenly saying to myself: "Why, this is Christmas Day." ?The Friendly Road, David Grayson It. Is hard for me to see how a great man can be an atheist. Without the sustaining influence of faith in a divine power we could have little faith in ourselves. We need to feel that behind us is intelligence and love. Doubters do not achieve; skeptics do not contribute; cynics do not create. Faith is the great motive power; and no man realizes his full possibilities unless he has the deep conviction that life is eternally important and that his work, well done, is a part of an unending plan. ?Fundamentals of a Successful Life, Calvin Coolidge. There is no real wealth in gold. People talk about being wealthy?about being rich; but place the richest banking company in the world upon a barren rock, with their gold piled around them, with no possible chance of exchanging it, and destitute of the creature comforts, and they would be poor indeed.... 64 Men and women who are trying to make themselves happy in the possession of wealth or power will miss it, for nothing short of the Gospel of the Son of God can make the inhabitants of the earth happy, and prepare them to enjoy heaven here and hereafter. Discourses of Brigham Young, pages 473-4, 483. Our national welfare should always be a theme deeply rooted in our minds and exemplified in our individual lives, and the desire for our nation's good should be stronger than political party adherence. The nation's welfare means the welfare of every one of its citizens. To be a worthy and a prosperous nation, it must possess those qualities which belong to individual virtues. The attitude of our country toward other nations should always be honest and above suspicion, and every good citizen should be jealous of our nation's reputation both at home and abroad. National patriotism is, therefore, something more than mere expression of willingness to fight, if need be. Gospel Doctrine, Joseph F. Smith, page 517. Latter-day Saints, of all people, should show excellence in didactic literature. Opportunity for such expression is abundantly afforded them. And they will grow in grace and power if they study and practice expressing uplifting thoughts that come to them?not in just commonplace style?but with sincerity, and simple artistry. As a practical suggestion: Appreciate the ideas God gives you by writing them in your own best language; also keep inspirational thoughts others express?a few strikingly effective ones that have impressed you. With such practice and appreciation, skill to write and to speak will grow in you. Thousands upon thousands of choice sermons, essays, orations have been created and will continue to be created down the years. Again, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?JANUARY 1946 if time is not to be wasted on the mediocre, we must cultivate a sense of selection.. No two of us will choose the same; our backgrounds for appreciation differ; even our moods change. Yet, if there is to be an upbuilding of our lives, only that which promotes a love for the good, the beautiful, and the true will claim our time and attention. This does not mean that we shall choose only those selections which plainly are linked with the Bible in word or spirit. Much of our didactic literature, particularly of the essay type, is created largely to inform or entertain. Observe, for example, the following paragraph from one of John Burrough's nature sketches, The Apple: How they resist the cold! Holding out almost as long as the red cheeks of the boys do. A frost that destroys the potatoes and other roots only makes the apple more crisp and vigorous; they peep out from the chance November snows unscathed. When I see the fruit vendor on the street comer stamping his feet and beating his hands to keep them warm, and his naked apples lying exposed to the blasts, I wonder if they do not ache to clap their hands and enliven their circulation. But they can stand it nearly as long as the vendor can. No mention of the Bible in this apple sketch, yet it brings enjoyment and stirs good memories, as do all well-written and wholesome essays on nature. Literature that takes us out-of-doors, that opens our eyes to the wonder world around us, that lets us travel far and wide, even though we do not leave our firesides to do it?is always helpful, if it is clean and pure. We may get not only information, but interpretation of human folk and also some good fun from such reading. LESSON DEPARTMENT A classic book of travel that spreads a feast of geography, history, descriptions of nature and human nature for us, with bits of humor thrown in to spice the trip, is Mark Twain's Innocents Abroad. Most folk think of this great writer as merely a humorist. He is all that and more. Observe, for example, these soul-lifting lines from the book just named: Night is the time to see Galilee. ... Its history and its associations are its chiefest charm, in any eyes, and the spells they weave are feeble in the searching light of the sun. Then we scarcely feel the fetters. Our thoughts wander constantly to the practical things of life. . . . But when day is done, even the most unimpressionable must yield to the dreamy influences of this tranquil starlight. ... In the lapping of the waves upon the beach, he hears the dip of ghostly oars; in the secret noises of the night he hears spirit voices; in the soft sweep of the breeze, the rush of invisible wings. Phantom ships are on the sea, the dead of twenty centuries come forth from the tombs, and in the dirges of the night wind the songs of forgotten ages find utterance again. In the starlight, Galilee has no boundaries but the broad compass of the heavens, and is a theater meet for great events; meet for the birth of a religion able to save the world; and meet for the stately Figure appointed to stand upon its stage and pro-claim its high decrees. . . . One can com-prehend it only when night has hidden all incongruities and created a theater proper for so grand a drama. With his vivid word pictures, his humorous touches, his sharp shafts at the sham and show and mockeries that bring unholiness to sacred placess, the author takes us round the land of Palestine, and leaves us, as he does in the above paragraphs, with deeper appreciation of the inner meaning and significance of storied places round which we linger with him in that Holy Land. Another selection which brings us closer to the spirit of religion and to the heart of a great American, comes from a treasured book, presented to the writer by President Grant, Abra-ham Lincoln? Man oi God, by John Wesley Hill. In this volume, rich with incidents of Lincoln, is a story told by one of his boyhood friends. This friend, on invitation, had ac-companied Lincoln to the home of a woman who had but a few hours to live. She had requested that her will be made before she passed away. When this was done, she said to Lincoln, "Now I have my affairs in this world arranged satisfactorily. I have also made preparation for the life to come. I do not fear death. I am glad that I am soon to meet those who have gone before." ' T our faith in God is wise and strong," said Lincoln. "Your hope of a future life is blessed." She then asked him if he would not read a few verses from the Bible. They offered him the Book; he did not take it but began reciting from memory the Twenty- third Psalm. Then he quoted the first part of the fourteenth chapter of John, 'In my Father?s house are many mansions; if it were not so I would have told you.? After he had given these and other quotations from the scriptures, he recited several hymns, closing with "Rock of Ages, Cleft for Me." "A little while after the woman passed to her reward," said the friend. "As we rode home in the buggy, I expressed surprise that he should have acted as pastor as well as attorney so perfectly, and Lincoln replied, 'God and eternity were very near me today.'

Social Science Modern Applications of Moral Principles Lesson 13?Some Broader Applications of Social Ethics Dr. Harold T. Christensen For Tuesday, April 23, 1946 Lesson link: Moral aspects of courtship, marriage, widowhood, and other phases of family life were analyzed last time. It was shown that family stability is necessary to the building and maintaining of morals, and that morality in turn is fundamental to family stability. Selfishness was regarded as the major reason for family breakdown, the primary source of immorality in marriage; and, in contrast, love, co-operation, and helpfulness were named as the essence of family ethics. Lesson aim: To examine some of the inequalities and inhumanities existent in the world today, and to show that justice, when not violated, leads to both peace and happiness. LESSON DEPARTMENT LOOKING back over previous lessons, and remembering particularly the brotherhood principle, we can see that morality is offended whenever justice is violated. Advancements and satisfactions based upon self-interest alone are not enough when it comes to ethics; self-righteousness is no righteousness at all. Real morality is based upon love, equality, fraternity, and justice.
Need and Greed
In 1933, the middle of the great depression, America had between twelve and seventeen million workers unemployed. Several million are unemployed regularly, even in normal years. Furthermore, income varies greatly among those who are able to find work, as shown by the fact that in the 1935-36 period nearly half of America's families received yearly incomes of less than $1,000 each and the 195,000 highest income families received as much as the 13,000,000 families with lowest income. It was President Franklin D. Roosevelt who said that at least one-third of our families are "ill-housed, ill-clothed, ill-fed." During depression years the percentage of poverty goes even lower than that. In America, "the land of opportunity," the land favored with an abundance of natural resources as in no other spot on the earth, poverty and pauperism exist side by side with surplus and waste, people starve in the midst of plenty.
Greed is the explanation for much of the need in the world today. Our great maldistribution of wealth, which permits all of this suffering, is not to be explained on the basis of power and privilege more than ability and effort. It is true, of course, that individuals differ in capacities and abilities as well as in application and effort, so that it is utterly impossible to imagine any individual or level economic equality over a long stretch of time; wealth will quite naturally gravitate to those with ability and industry, and to some extent it should. Even so, any real justice tempered with Christian mercy would require that no one be permitted to go without the necessities of life; the "haves" should feel a responsibility for the "have nots." But more serious even than the widespread tendency on the part of the fortunate to refuse charities and ignore the handicapped, is the fact that economic fortune is so often related to luck, privilege, and a willingness to cheat. While we cannot expect equality so far as ability and industry are concerned, we do not even have an equality of opportunity. Wealth depends too much upon special advantage and deceit, not enough upon effort and honesty.
The profit motive in business, industry, labor groups, and some professions is apparently amoral in its nature, for it takes little heed of ethics or public welfare; expediency is the thing; profit is placed above principle. Advertising all too frequently overplays the qualities of the product in order to sell for profit. Merchandising has likewise in too many instances become a game of deceiving and tricking the public; note the technique of high-pressure salesmanship, for example; and the practice of making goods in order to mark them down again for a "sale"; and the tendency to reduce the quality of goods, jump price ceilings, and in other ways profiteer in wartime. Many big-time industrialists are still ready and willing to exploit the laborer and cheat the consumer in order to build up power and accumulate huge profits. And organized labor, on the other hand, has frequently resorted to work slowdowns, wage holdups, and other questionable devices; in its legitimate struggle for equality, labor has frequently gone rabid and extreme; its cry for justice has too often become a demand for power and special privilege. Professional ethics is probably more highly developed than business, industrial, or labor ethics, but even here is the frequent spirit of money madness. Unless the profit motive can somehow or other be tempered or oriented in the direction of social welfare in all fields of economic activity, justice will never be reached and morality will remain a thing talked about but seldom practiced.
Latter-day Saints should be appreciative of the Church Welfare Program, for its aim is that of security through both self-effort and brotherly love. Emphasis is upon helping people to help themselves rather than encouraging them to accept something for nothing. This is a high moral principle. Personal effort and individual responsibility are of primary concern, as they must always be in any true moral system. But also in the plan is the idea that mercy must go beyond mere justice; greed give way to brotherhood, and the actual needs of people be met by the individual himself if he is able to work, next by his family, and finally by the Church. By sustaining the dignity of labor this program avoids pauperization. By insisting upon moral responsibility toward both self and neighbors it builds character. Fundamentally it is a program of security through industry and mutual aid in the spirit of Christ.
Racketeering
Defined broadly, racketeering simply means to obtain money by fraud, swindle, or other immoral procedures. Sometimes it is outside the law, but often, too, it is technically within the law though beyond all bounds of ethics. The essential idea in racketeering is the circumvention of law for the sake of big money; it is the idea of extortion, or taking money with trickery or force without earning it. The law is evaded sometimes by direct defiance, as in the case of the so-called criminal; sometimes by hiring clever lawyers to find legal loopholes and technical escape valves; and sometimes by bribing public officials for the sake of protection. But always in racketeering there is the spirit of getting something for nothing; the idea that "only the foolish work."
Following are some of the leading types of rackets: (1) Organized robbery, burglary, and larceny. This is usually carried on by criminal gangs and is, of course, in defiance of the law. (2) Dishonest business dealings such as misrepresenting funds, "watering" stock, profiteering on war contracts, promoting fake enterprises, managing banks, stock exchanges, or corporations fraudulent in kind and other varieties. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?JANUARY 1946 LESSON DEPARTMENT (3) Organized racketeering of industries. Sometimes this is spoken of as "gangster" control, actually, although this kind of criminal more often escapes the hand of the law, white-collar crime cheats the public out of far more money each year than do the more obvious types of stealing. (3) Kidnapping. This extremely depraved form of racket flourished here some ten or fifteen years ago but the Lindbergh law, which prescribes the death penalty for kidnappers, and the activities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation have practically put an end to it. (4) Bootlegging and the black market. During the prohibition era bootlegging became so prevalent as to constitute a national scandal, and during World War II the black market has expanded to similar proportions. In both cases millions of people have shown themselves willing to take advantage of an artificial legal scarcity and to run against the law for the sake of personal profit. (5) Professional gambling. By playing upon people's willingness to take a chance in order to "get rich quick," and resorting to underhanded trickery, professional gamblers are able to take millions of dollars away from the American public each year. In some areas this is legal, but in most places where gambling establishments operate they do so outside the law. (6) Tribute for "protection." Organized gangs, in the larger cities particularly where they often have an "understanding" with the political machine in power, sometimes extort large sums of money from the various business establishments on the farce of "protection." Unless each establishment hands over to these gangsters the requested sum, it will find its buildings wrecked with a bomb, its goods destroyed with acid, or some other mysterious disaster happening to it?and knowing this, the 69 establishment usually ? comes through. This is one of the most vicious types of racketeering. (7) Betrayal of public office. Where public officials accept bribes, let contracts at inflated figures with the understanding that they will get a "cut" from the contractor, sell their own goods to the government at padded values, or in any other way use their office dishonestly for personal profit, they are betraying the public and deserting all claim to morality. Political Corruption But this is exactly what is happening in so many cases-Organized crime and racketeering, discussed above; would have a difficult time surviving if it were not for the "big fix" where unscrupulous politicians agree to protect criminals, of both the overall and white-collar varieties, in return for votes and money. Political machines are closely organized party organizations that are primarily interested in votes and power regardless of how these are obtained. Party "bosses" with numerous henchmen under them administer their machines in an arbitrary, dictatorial manner. Votes are bought with money and_ personal favors; public jobs are handed out to supporters of the machine regardless of qualifications, and sometimes even jobs, which carry large compensations but little or no work, are created on the books for "faithful" party members; occasionally there is illegal control at the polls and a miscounting of votes. Machine politics is corrupt at its very core for it caters to vested interests, to pressure groups, and not to the will of the people. Corrupt politics is not confined to ~~ any one political party. Blind bigoted party loyalty, with little concern for the issues or the personalities involved, is as un-democratic as it is un-American; and yet we have and have had much of it. Narrow expediency in party politics, at the sacrifice of principle, is as un-Christian as it is immoral; and yet it abounds on every hand., As said in an earlier lesson, what we need is 'more statesmen and fewer politicians?more who are courageous enough to put justice and public welfare before private profit, and fewer who are willing to fleece the public for their own good. Since much of the inefficiency and corruption that is permitted to exist in government circles is there because of an uninformed and indifferent voting public, it follows that the only solution is an enlightened and aroused citizenry. War and Peace The periodic continuation of war throughout the ages, and the tendency for modern wars to be even more total in their brutality and their destructive tendencies than earlier ones is a pretty sad reflection upon the moral progress of mankind. War is basically immoral for it leads to suffering and sorrow rather than peace and happiness. And yet war persists and grows in intensity. But though war is an evil of considerable magnitude, it is not the greatest evil in the world today. Peace is highly desirable, but peace at any price is indefensible and inconceivable. The greatest evil of mankind is injustice, and until this can be eliminated wars will be inevitable and, to some extent, justifiable. There is no point in appeasing the perpetuators of wrong and Oppression; any compromise with error and evil is unthinkable. As wrong as war is, if it is a war for justice, truth, and righteousness it has some justification. (For a justification of killing for righteous purposes see 1 Nephi, chap. 4.) Permanent peace, the goal of mankind and the capstone of moral progress, can hardly be realized without the establishment first of all of equality and justice. Unless democracy and Christianity can be felt internally and lived nationally, there 'is little hope for any world-wide or universal application of these principles. Until we are wise enough and big enough to clean up our own house there is little chance that we will ever be able to help much in the building of a better world. Real happiness, then, can never come without peace, nor peace without justice, justice without brotherhood. The key to peace and happiness in this life, or the life to come, is and will always be love, equality, and justice. Problems for Thought and Action 1. Cite figures to show the great maldistribution of wealth in this country. Are all men equal in ability, in industry or effort, in opportunity? Give reasons for your answers. How do inequalities in ability, effort, and opportunity explain the inequalities in wealth? Which of these do you think are justified? Show how the profit motive often operates in defiance of ethics, Give illustrations from the various fields of economic activity, and discuss each.

Richardson Dear Emma: So you think I am feeble? how little you know About your big sister out here in the snow; I'll tell you about it, I'll be honest as of yore, In a very short time I will be eighty-four. To begin with, last year, I had passed eighty-three, Just what I could do, Santa Claus told to me. So I made fourteen doilies? some large and some small. Four pillow cases? handmade lace and all. I crocheted three shopping bags, they are handy and neat To take down to the stores and use on the street. To carry small parcels, Christmas ribbons and tags. To help out the salvage and save paper bags. Then came two house dresses? all trimmed with stitchin', Five calico aprons to wear in the kitchen. I help make my dresses, I trim hats and mend. One can always find sewing that never does end. Now I wash and I iron, I sweep with a broom; I mop and I cook and I clean my own room; I write dozens of letters, and this is no joke, If it weren't for me. Uncle Sam would go broke. To Relief Society sometimes I go To work on the quilts and help others sew; They sent me a bag of soft flannel scraps To make little quilts for sick men's laps. If my friends take the notion to have a nice lunch And if I'm invited, I go with the bunch; I dance and I sing, I have plenty to say. With the help of a stick I can walk every day. Old age makes one slow? I've lost all my speed. But you'll have to confess that I've not gone to seed. I get pretty tired, but I'm willing to try; And I'll never give up till the day that I die. I count all my blessings, dear sister, a score. Then why should I care if I am eighty-four! So I'm hoping these lines will bring consolation. Brigham Young University Welcomes?
