THE TRAVELER Margery S. Stewart Did Mary wait beside the village inn, Grateful for shadows, sheltering and cool, And smile in answer to a small boy's smile, As he went whistling to the sun-warmed pool? Did women pause and murmur gentle things, Wondering at Mary's face, its radiant awe, Before they hurried to the shaded well, Telling the first one there to haste and draw A gourd of water for the burdened girl? Did Mary hold again, with gentle hands, The swaddling clothes so finely spun and made, Seeing her baby in their tender bands, Feeling the hour grow nigh with quickening dusk? Did she see Joseph coming, and rise up And go to meet him, glad for journey's end, Lifting in silence every mother's cup? The Cover: "Rock Canyon in Winter," Photograph by Dr. Walter P. Cottam MARY OF NAZARETH From the painting "Star of Bethlehem" by Piglhein Our Wives and Our Mothers in the Eternal Plan President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. [Delivered at the general session of the general Relief Society conference held in the Tabernacle, Thursday afternoon, October 3, 1946.] S I look out over this great audience, Sister Spafford, I wonder where you are going to put the Priesthood tomorrow. I am greatly honored in being asked to address you again. It seems to me only last conference that this honor was accorded me before. I would like to endorse all that our good sisters have said here today, and to congratulate Sister Spafford on the far vision which she has of the work of your great organization, the greatest organization of its kind in the world. I pray that the blessings of the Lord may be with the Relief Society, for you do a service which no other organization in the Church can do. My subject today is a request subject. Some months ago, before a stake conference, I gave a little talk which some of your officers heard, and thought that you might be interested if I repeated it, elaborating it somewhat. I apologize for reading it but I had so much to say that I wanted to say reasonably carefully, that I thought my only safety would be in writing it out, and therefore, I shall read it to you. To find the place of our wives and mothers in the eternal plan, we must trace out the creation and peopling of this earth from "the beginning," yet remembering the Lord has said that "unto myself my works have no end, neither beginning" (Doc. And Cov. 29:33; and see Doc. And Cov. 39:1; 20:26; 61:1; 76:4; 88; 6:13; 93:8-10; Moses 1:3; Ps. 90:2; 102:27) and remembering also that as to this earth John declared: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God," (John 1:1-2) and remembering further that, in our day, the Lord has made clear that for this earth "Man was also in the beginning with God" (Doc. And Cov. 93:29). I shall trace out the account of the creation according to my understanding of the sequence of the scriptures. The Lord has declared to us in our day that he "looked upon the wide expanse of eternity, and all the seraphic hosts of heaven, before the world was made" (Doc. And Cov. 38:1). He told Abraham, having first shown him "the intelligences that were organized before the world was": "I came down in the beginning in the midst of all the intelligences thou hast seen" and "organized" them (Abraham 3:21-22). Thereafter, God held, in the due course of our mundane creation as recorded in scriptural sequence, a Great Council in Heaven, in which it seems all of us may have participated, Page 795 796 and he told Abraham that he, God, then stood in the midst of these intelligences, and "among all these there were many of the noble and great ones; And God saw these souls that they were good... And he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits... And he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born" (Abraham 3:22-23). [N the Great Council, so convened, two plans were presented for creating and peopling an earth. The one by Satan proposed to destroy the agency of man and to redeem all mankind that not one soul be lost. Men were to be mere automatons (Moses 4:1-4). 'This plan was rejected because all growth and progress come by work and overcoming obstacles. The other plan, proposed by the Only Begotten, left man his free agency, that he might become strong and advance in learning, knowledge, wisdom, and righteousness by conquering error.. As part of his plan the Only Begotten proposed: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell" (Abraham 3:24). This plan was accepted. 'And then," says the record, "the Lord said: Let us go down. And they went down at the beginning, and they, that is the Gods, organized and formed the heavens and the earth" (Abraham 4:1). The scriptures hold one language, that the Only Begotten Son was the actual workman who built the world, as well as all that exists upon RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�DECEMBER 1946 it, plant, animal, and man. John, in his great hymn opening his Gospel, from which I have already quoted, sang: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men... And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, ) full of grace and truth (John 1:1-4, 14). Moreover, in a mighty vision, Moses, by the Spirit of God: Beheld the earth, yea even all of it; and there was not a particle of it which he did not behold,.... And he beheld also the inhabitants thereof, and there was not a soul which he beheld not; and he discerned them by the Spirit of God; and their numbers were great, even numberless as the sand upon the sea shore.... And the Lord God said unto Moses: For mine own purpose have I made these things. Here is wisdom and it remaineth in me. And by the word of my power, have I created them, which is mine Only Begotten Son, who is full of grace and truth (Moses 1:27-28, 31-32). We might observe, furthermore, that God has other worlds in the universe. He declared to Moses: And worlds without number have I created; and I also created them for mine own purpose; and by the Son I created them, which is mine Only Begotten.... For behold, there are many worlds that have passed away by the word of my power. And there are many that now stand, and innumerable are they unto man; but all things are numbered unto me, for they are mine and I know them (Moses 1:33, 353 7:30, 36). ' After the Lord described the creation of the earth in the six "days" mentioned in Genesis and in the Book of Moses, or in the six "times" mentioned in the Book of Abraham, he made to Moses the following declaration, paralleled in his words to Abraham: For I, the Lord God, created all things, of which I have spoken, spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth. For I, the Lord God, had not caused it to rain upon the face of the earth. And I, the Lord God, had created all the children of men; and not yet a man to till the ground; for in heaven created I them; and there was not yet flesh upon the earth, neither in the water, neither in the air; But I, the Lord God, spake, and there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. And I, the Lord God, formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul, the first flesh upon the earth, the first man also; nevertheless, all things were before created; but spiritually were they created and made according to my word (Moses 3:5-7). Abraham records the creation of man in these words: And the Gods formed man from the dust of the ground, and took his spirit (that is, the man's spirit), and put it into him; and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul (Abraham 5:7). HUS, as to this earth, there were two creations, first the spiritual (Gen. 1; 2:5; Moses 2; 3:5; 6:51; Abraham 4; 5:5), and then the temporal (Gen. 2:1-25; Moses 3: 6-24; Abraham 5:6-18; Doc. And Cov. 29:31), as we name them, though we should remember that, in our day, the Lord has told us, speaking of things "temporal" and things "spiritual," and contrasting them, "all things unto me are spiritual." (Doc. And Cov. 29:34.) According to the sequence of the scriptural record, the Lord, after making man "from the dust of the ground," planted a Garden, "eastward in Eden"; then made plant life to grow "out of the ground," with "living souls." In Eden, God planted also the two fateful trees�the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, concerning which God gave specific commandments to Adam. He caused a river to flow "out of Eden to water the garden." (Moses 3:8-14; Abraham 5:7 ff.; Gen. 2:8 ff.) The Lord then recorded: And I, the Lord God, took the man, and put him into the Garden of Eden, to dress it, and to keep it (Moses 3:15; and see Abraham 5:11; Gen. 2:15). Following this in the scriptural sequence, the record reads: And out of the ground I, the Lord God, formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and commanded that they should come unto Adam, to see what he would call them; and they were also living souls; for I, God, breathed into them the breath of life, 4nd commanded that whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that should be the name thereof.... But as for Adam, there was not found an help meet for him (Moses 3:19- 20; and see Abraham 5:20; Gen. 2:19). Thus Adam had some part in this temporal creation, just what part is not definitely set out in the scriptural record, except that he did give the animals their names. By this we might possibly understand that at least he took a sort of census, checked over the creations, perhaps making sure that each of the great animal families was represented by types that were capable of being the progenitors from which might spring and develop the various types and sub-types and species now extant, in the same way and by the same natural processes that the different OUR WIVES AND OUR MOTHERS IN THE ETERNAL PLAN 797 798 races and peoples of today's earth stem back to a common progenitor pair�Adam and Eve. Thus, on the scriptural record, Adam's service may have determined when the creation was complete. But that point is not important in our discussion today. What were the processes of creation? How was it done? Paul declared to the Hebrews that "Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God" (Hebrews 11:3)�faith which is declared to be the gift of God (Rom. 10:17; I Cor. 12:9). Now Paul defined faith as "the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen" (Heb. WT Orson Pratt said: And as faith is the moving cause of all action in temporal concerns, so it is in spiritual.... By this we understand that the principle of power which existed in the bosom of God, by which the worlds were framed, was faith.... Had it not been for the principle of faith the worlds would never have been framed, neither would man have been formed of the dust (Lectures on Faith, Sec. 1:12, 15-16). Through what instrumentality was this faith employed? We have already given the scriptures declaring that the Only Begotten did the work, with help from others acting under the authority and command of the Father (Abraham 4). What was this authority? Brigham Young said: If anybody wants to know what the Priesthood of the Son of God is, it is the law by which the worlds are, were, and will continue for ever and ever. It is that system which brings worlds into existence and peoples them, gives them their revolutions�their days, weeks, months, years, their seasons and times and by which they are rolled up as a scroll, as it RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�DECEMBER 1946 were, and go into a higher state of existence (Discourses, page 201; 1941 edition, page 130). The Prophet Joseph has told us: The Priesthood is an everlasting principle, and existed with God from eternity, and will to eternity, without beginning of days or end of years; that Christ is the Great High Priest; Adam next and that Adam obtained his priesthood in the Creation, before the world was formed (Smith's Teachings, pp. 157-158). Up to this point in the eternal course of world progression, as recorded in the scriptures, the Priesthood had performed the full service rendered, all had been done in the spiritual and temporal creations by the Great High Priest, with Adam, who stands "next," and others assisting (See Abraham 4). Plant life had been so created that by the laws of reproduction set up to govern that life, plants might propagate their own kinds; animal life had been created, male and female, that they might reproduce each its own kind. NOW: again following the scriptural order of events, it is recorded before the record is made that Adam was given a body 'from the dust of the earth,' that God said to him (and it may be to all the hosts assembled): "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth" (Moses 2:28; Abraham 4:28). Upon the fulfillment of this command, so given, depended the whole Plan of the Great Council in Heaven, because those who kept their "first estate," must have opportunity to come to earth, to obtain mortal bodies, that they might then be proved in this "second estate," "to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them... And they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever" (Abra- _ ham 3:25-26). To provide mortal bodies and a mortal life and experience for the waiting spirits, was the very purpose of the creation. Adam, still in intimate association with the Lord, must have remembered at least a part of what he knew before he was made "'from the dust of the ground," and, if so, he must have recalled the eternal truth of motherhood, so beautifully voiced by Eliza R. Snow in her great poem: In the heavens are parents single? No; the thought makes reason stare! Truth is reason, truth eternal Tells me I've a mother there. Yet, notwithstanding the great powers of the Priesthood which he held, Adam was powerless to go forward by himself, to the providing of earthly tabernacles for the spirits eager to enter into their "second estate," so that, as the Lord's plan provided, they might have opportunity to "prove" themselves, and, so doing, "have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever." Under the eternal law, there must be a father not only, but a mother as well. "And I, God," declared the Father, "created man in mine own image, in the image of mine Only Begotten created I him; male and female created I them" (Moses 2:27; Gen. 1:27). To work all this out, it was indispensable that the Priesthood, powerful as it was, must have help. Adam must have an helpmeet. We will recall that, according to the sequence of the record, the Lord, after he laid out the Garden of Eden and watered it, said: And I, the Lord God, took the man, and put him into the Garden of Eden, to dress it, and to keep it (Moses 3:15; Abraham 5:11; Gen. 2:15). Thereafter, the Lord explained to Adam and gave to him the commandments regarding the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. After the Lord God placed Adam in the Garden, he spoke thus: And I, the Lord God, said unto mine Only Begotten, that it was not good that the man should be alone; wherefore, I will make an help meet for him (Moses 3:18; Abraham 5:14; Gen. 2:18). NE may easily believe that some longing or unexpressed desire of Adam, alone in the magnificence and glory of Eden, drew this expression of purpose from the loving Father. For Adam, still in communion with the Father, not yet forgetting that in Heaven parents are not single and that he had a mother there, and still recalling (as we have just pointed out) the Great Plan presented to the Council of Heaven which provided that all the intelligences there assembled were to have the chance to come to earth, receive bodies, and, desiring it, "keep their second estate," (Abraham 3:25 ff) Adam, with all this in mind, must have realized the great responsibility which rested upon him; he must have known the part he was to play (for, we must remember, not yet was he shut out from the Father), and he knew, what later, after the Fall, Eve was to sing, (Moses 5:11) that 'he must have seed, that he must know good from evil, that he might have the joy of redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient OUR WIVES AND OUR MOTHERS IN THE ETERNAL PLAN 799 Adam alone, no matter what his Priesthood, could not bring this about. He must have a helper. But, Adam wandered alone in the glorious Garden in Eden, which he had dressed and adorned�the Garden of Eden with its stately trees, its lovely flowers heavy with sweet odors, its grassy swards, its magnificent vistas with the far reaches of its placid rivers, with its gaily plumed 'birds, its lordly and graceful beasts, all at peace, for sin was not yet in the world. Through all this magnificence Adam wandered, lonely, unsolaced, uncompanioned, the only being of his kind in the whole world, his life unshared in a solitude: of exquisite elegance, and, what was of far greater moment, his mission, as he knew it to be, impossible of fulfillment, except the Father gave him an helpmeet. So, obedient to the necessities of the commandment given that man should multiply and replenish the earth; pursuant to his promise, after he had placed Adam in the Garden of Eden, that since it was not good that man should be alone, God would make an helpmeet for him; and resultant from his observation, following the record of the creation of the animal kingdom "out of the ground" (Moses 3:19-20), that 'there was not found an helpmeet for Adam,' the Father created and brought to Adam, his wife, Eve. Then Adam cried aloud: This I know now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man (Moses 3:23). Glorified by the joy of this great blessing that had come to him, Adam announced the great law of marriage, the union of man and wife, joined together by the power of the � Priesthood for time and for all eternity: Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife; and they shall be one flesh (Moses 3:24; Abraham 5:18; Genesis 2:24). So came Eve, an helpmeet to the Priesthood mission of Adam�Eve the last created being in the creation of the world, without whom the whole creation of the world and all that was in the world would have been in vain and the "purposes of God have come to naught. Receiving her, Adam took her in her purity, took her, radiant and divinely fair, into the Garden he had dressed and kept for her, into the bridal home he had built, into the Garden that from then till now has been the symbol of heaven on earth, there to begin together their earthly life, that was finally to bring opportunity for salvation and exaltation to the untold myriads of spirits then waiting for the mortal tabernacles these two were to make it possible for them to possess. THE Only Begotten had fashioned the world, had filled it with beautiful flowers and lofty forests, with grasses and grains, and multitudes of living creatures; Adam had had some part in this. But the key to the glorious arch of temporal, earthly creation for man was still missing. So Eve came to build, to organize, through the power of the Father, the bodies of mortal men, to be a creator of bodies under the faculties given her by the Priesthood of God, so that God's design and the Great Plan might meet fruition. 800 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�DECEMBER 1946 This was her calling; this was her blessing, bestowed by the Priesthood. This is the place of our wives and of our mothers in the Eternal Plan. They are not bearers of the Priesthood; they are not charged with carrying out the duties and functions of the Priesthood; nor are they laden with its responsibilities; they are builders and organizers under its power, and partakers of its blessings, possessing the complement of the Priesthood powers and possessing a function as divinely called, as eternally important in its place as the Priesthood itself. Millenniums later, Paul, under the inspiration of God, was to declare: Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord. For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God (I Cor. 11:11-12), When, after the Fall, both Adam and Eve knowing good from evil, the Lord promised them redemption and Adam prophesied concerning their posterity. Eve, hearing the glorious Plan and the destiny of herself and Adam, was gladdened, and broke into a great song of praise: Were it not for our transgression we never should have had seed, and never should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient (Moses 5:11). From that day, when Eve thus placed first among her blessings the power to bear children, the greatest glory of true womanhood has been motherhood. What a miracle is motherhood; how nearly infinite is mother. She fashions in her womb the most complex structure known to man, the whole visible universe being, in contrast, the simplest of creations. From the cell she herself has built from the dust of the earth, fructified by the father cell formed also of dust of the earth by the father, she mounts cell on cell, each born of clay, till the normal man is brought into the world�built of head and trunk and limbs, of bone and flesh and blood, of brain, eyes, ears, and mouth, of muscles and sinews and nerves, of heart and lungs and stomach and intestines, of liver and spleen and kidneys, of glands and lymphs, of arms, hands and fingers, of legs, feet and toes, all of these and every vein and artery and nerve, every nail upon the fingers, every joint and muscle, each and every one in its never-varying place (save some prank of malformation), never the feet where the head should be, never the heart and lungs below and the liver and spleen and kidneys above, but all in perfect order, every man brought forth organized as were those who went before, as they will be who come after, the pattern in all its infinite detail faithfully followed down to the last jot and tittle of the human frame�a body fashioned in the very image of the Son who was in the image of the Father. What an infinitely glorious concept, what a supreme destiny, and what a divine-like achievement. This is wife's and mother's task and opportunity and did she fail so. That new body-forms came or that none came, then the Great Plan would fail and God's purposes would come to naught. They must build in the likeness of the Father and "the 'Son. "lls must ewer change. OUR WIVES AND OUR MOTHERS IN THE ETERNAL PLAN 801 THYs she must go forward always, from now till time, being no more, merges into eternity, that all the spirits keeping their "first estate," shall come into their "second estate" to prove whether they shall live that estate and be given life everlasting. Thus Eve's daughters, under the destiny God gave to them, must build for every spirit, a body that the spirit can call its own for the span of time not only, but for the expanse of eternity through the resurrection, so that every soul, willing to work and sacrifice for it, can Become perfect even as our Father in Heaven is perfect.' Eve's daughters only can do the service that thus makes possible this perfection. The Priesthood cannot do this without the helpmeet. Her spirit breathing to her mind this divine truth, the mother folds the newborn to her breast, and into her soul comes the mother love that lives thence forever, for this tiny being is 'bone of her bone, flesh of her flesh.' The crowning glory of motherhood came to the daughters of Eve, when, in Bethlehem, there was born to Mary of Nazareth, a mortal, the Christ child, begot of the Father. Gabriel "sent from God," had foretold to Mary, "Hail... Highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed... Thou among women" (Luke 1:28). And later Mary's cousin Elisabeth, about to bear John, the Great Forerunner of whom the Christ declared, "Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist" (Matt. 11:11; see Luke 7:28). Elisabeth "filled with the Holy Ghost, spake out with a loud voice" to Mary, who came _ to visit her, saying, "Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb" (Luke 1:41-42). Then Mary, likewise inspired, broke forth into her great song of joy and humble triumph: My soul doth magnify the Lord, And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden; for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name. And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation. He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree. He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away. He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy; As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever (Luke 1:46 ff.). So spake this mortal mother soon to bear the mortal, yet deified Christ. The spirit of prophecy entered her soul, and, recalling the past, and being enlightened as to the future, she forecast the. Work and service, the love and character of him whom she was to bring forth �the Christ, the Redeemer of the World. S� measurably may every mother who has lived and is living righteously, envision something of the destiny of her offspring, if it be God's will. But the full glory of motherhood is not yet reached when her child comes forth into this world of trial, nor is her opportunity for service passed when her creation breathes 802 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�DECEMBER 1946 the breath of life. Still from the dust of the earth she must fabricate the food that keeps alive and nourishes the little one. She feeds not only, but clothes it. She cares for it by day and watches over it by night. When illness comes, she nurses it with that near divine love that fills her heart. She gently leads its faltering steps, till it walks alone. She helps to frame its first lisps and teaches it the full art of speech. As consciousness matures, she deftly sows into the plastic mind the love of God, of truth, and, as the years flow by and youth comes on, she adds the love of honor, of honesty, of sobriety, of industry, of chastity. She teaches, bit by bit, loyalty and reverence and devotion. She implants and makes part of the growing, virgin intellect an under. Standing of the restored gospel. She steadies the swaying will when temptation first comes. She builds into the warp and woof of her creation, self-control, independence, righteousness, love of God, and a desire and will to serve him. Thus to the full stature of manhood and womanhood, mother guides, incites, entreats, instructs, directs, on occasion commands, the soul for which she built the earthly home, in its march onward to exaltation. God gives the soul its destiny, but mother leads it along the Way. When the souls Shall return 'to ' the presence of the Father of All, the worthy mothers will be there to welcome their worthy children, and bow and humbly speak: FATHER, we come back to thee with the righteous souls whose earthly bodies thou lettest us to build, 'bone of our bone, flesh of our flesh,' all to thine everlasting honor and glory and to our blessing and exaltation forever. Blessed were our wombs, for they bore children, even as thou didst command, in the image. Of thine Only Begotten, who is in the image of thee. Richly fruitful have been our blessings on earth, for we come back home to thee with these thy children. Great is the joy of this the end of our labors, for these souls have been saved with eternal life. Blessed were we in our example set, for thou gavest us the power to live worthily; in the teaching of thy children, thou didst give us a goodly measure of wisdom, Blessed were we in our faith, for thou didst richly endow us with this thy gift. Blessed were we in our understanding, for thou didst cause the Holy Ghost to enlighten our minds. Blessed were we in our living, for thou didst give us patience and kindliness, and forgiving natures, with charity and unbounded love. Blessed were we that thou didst send these spirits to the bodies which we by thy power fashioned, for they were choice spirits. Blessed were we in their Tearing, for they walked always in thy paths: and in their maturity they departed not from the ways of their youth. Blessed were in their companionship, for they were loving and kind, respectful and obedient to us. Blessed were we in the mortal fathers of our children's bodies, for they gave us comfort and help, and love and kindness unmeasured, and OUR WIVES AND OUR MOTHERS IN THE ETERNAL PLAN 803 804 likewise walked worthily before thee. Our souls cry out to thee, our Father, in worship of thee, for thou hast been with us from the beginning and hast covenanted to be with us during all eternity. Honor and Glory and Love to thee forever, and forever. Then we shall believe the Father will say to the mothers: Well done, thou good and faithful handmaids, enter thou into the rest I have prepared for those who builded the mortal temples in which dwelt the spirits I created, that they might keep their second estate, for without the keeping of their second estate they could not have "glory added upon their heads for ever and ever" (Abraham 3:26). And then the Priesthood will wish to proclaim their debt to these their helpmeets without whom the Priesthood could not have worked out their destiny. And the Priesthood shall bow in reverence and in love RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�DECEMBER 1946 unbounded before these mothers who did the service the Priesthood could not do, and thank and praise them for bearing their children, a service without which God's purposes had failed and the intelligences which God called around him "in the beginning" had been deprived of the divine destiny God marked out for them in the Great Council held in Heaven before the earth was formed. These, Wives and Mothers in Israel, are your rewards and your destinies. And � your offspring, saved and exalted in the presence of God, will never forget you, will ever bless you, and will sing hymns of eternal gratitude for the bodies you gave them and taught them to make the Temples of the Spirit of God. God be thanked for the knowledge he has given us of all this. Overflow our hearts with gratitude for this great destiny, I ask, in the name of Jesus, the Christ, Amen.

Before the dawn, Perhaps beyond the city's whir, He would find space Where she could bear her child.... The world, to know his peace on earth, Must be as humble as his place of birth, And look to the chosen Bethlehem, There where the holy symbols are� The stable, the manger, and the star., Hearken to Counsel Elder Joseph Fielding Smith Of the council of the Twelve [Delivered at the officers� meeting of the general Relief Society conference, held in the Assembly Hall, Thursday morning, October 3, 1946.] I THINK that we are all very much aware of the fact that we are living in perilous times, a day of trouble, so the prophets have said, when Satan is raging in the hearts of the people, and for that reason members of the Church should be just a little more careful, a little more prayerful, a little more diligent in keeping the commandments of the Lord.
Now, I will be just as brief as I can, and say a few things that I think will be of importance, and I think also, necessary.
Throughout the Church, as well as throughout the world, there is a spirit of indifference, a spirit that is not inclined to hearken to counsel, and Satan is raging to a very large extent in the hearts of many members of the Church.
In a magazine that was published here a few months ago, there appeared a very startling article calling attention to the fact that the great majority of crimes being committed today are by boys ranging from eight years up to twenty. Now, that is a very sad reflection upon our civilization, and a very sad reflection upon the homes of the people, but such a condition ought not, of course, to be found among Latter-day Saints. Our children ought to be faithful and true. They ought to be taught the principles of the Gospel; but we also discover throughout the Church and in our homes there is need for improvement. There is a lack of prayer.
I have said in stake conferences many times that we are no longer a praying people. Family prayer has practically disappeared. We are not teaching our children to pray, one of the great commandments the Lord has given us. And many of the women throughout the Church are too busy to attend to Church duties, but are given to pleasures, and neglect their children and their homes.
My attention has been called several times recently at stake conferences and within the week, to one evil practice which needs attention, and that is card playing. And I thought that it would not be amiss to say something about that along with some other things here this morning. From the time of the organization of the Church until now, all the Presidents of the Church have pleaded with the members not to play cards. Now this seems to be a fault among the sisters, perhaps, more than among the brethren, and yet the brethren are given to a very alarming extent. The report has come to me, frequently, that in our stakes the sisters will get together to play cards, notwithstanding the fact that they have been counseled so frequently against this evil, and it is an evil.


 About two weeks ago, a good sister in one of our stakes put a magazine in my hands, and it is a woman's magazine, which goes into the homes of many of our people. In that magazine, there was a very enticing article advising the parents in the home to teach their children, just as soon as they are able to be taught anything, to play cards, a most abominable thing. And I said to the sister, "Well, if I were subscribing to a magazine like that I would tell them to suspend the subscription. I would not have it.. I would not like to have a thing like that in my home." I have written down one or two statements here from President Joseph F. Smith. I have not had time, or I would have taken statements from others of the brethren. Before I read this, I will call attention, however, to this fact: That when the Mormon Battalion was ready to leave Leavenworth on their journey �I am not sure that it was not from Winter Quarters�President Brigham Young, in other advice that he gave to the Battalion, said they should not take cards with them, nor spend their time playing cards, and he called attention to the evils that result from it. NOW, I want to read you three paragraphs that I copied on this question. They are all from President Joseph F. Smith: Young people in their recreation should strive to form a love for that which will not be injurious. It is not true that only that recreation can be enjoyed that is detrimental to the body and spirit. We should train ourselves to find pleasure in that which invigorates, not stupifies and destroys the body, that which leads upward and not down, that which brightens, not dulls and stunts the intellect, that which elevates and exalts the spirit and not that which clogs and depresses it. So shall we please the Lord, enhance our own enjoyment and save ourselves and our children from impending sins, at the root of which, like the evil genius, lurks the spirit of cards and gaming. You will find that in The Improvement Era of June 1911. It is not an uncommon thing for women, young and middle aged, to spend whole afternoons and many of their evenings as well, in playing cards, thus wasting hours and days of precious time in this useless and unprofitable way. Yet those same people when approached declare they have no time to attend either Sunday School or meetings. Their Church duties are neglected for lack of time, yet they spend hours, day after day, at cards. They are thereby encouraged and become possessed of a spirit of indolence, and their minds are filled with a vile drunkenness, hallucination, charm and fascination that take possession of the habitual card player to the exclusion of all spiritual and religious feelings. Such a spirit detracts from all sacred thought or sentiment. These players at length do not quite know whether they are Jew, Gentile or Saint, and they do not care a fig. Cards are the most perfect and common instrumentalities of the gambler that have been devised, and the companionship of cards, like the companionship of most other games, is that of the gambling den and of the saloon, but cards do not stand alone in our enticement to evil. Any game that ultimately leads to questionable society, because it is the chief pleasure of such society, should be excluded from the home where innocent games cannot satisfy the required pleasures of the homie without encouraging card playing (Juvenile Instructor, September 1, 1903). RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�DECEMBER 1946 HEARKEN TO COUNSEL 806 Now, I say, that it has come to my attention so frequently that J thought it would not be amiss to call the sisters' attention to it, and I think you ought to use your influence to stop it, in your wards and in your stakes, by teaching your sisters through the Relief Society and other organizations, the evils of this thing which the Lord has condemned through his servants, the prophets. The Savior said to his disciples one time when he got very much annoyed: "Why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?" (Luke 6:46). We raise our hands and say we will support the President of the Church and the Authorities of the Church. Are we doing it? I am speaking not of you sisters here, but I am speaking, when I say that, of the members of the Church. Now I say, these are perilous times. The Devil is raging, and there are more temptations, more avenues for sinning today, among our people, than ever before in the history of the Church. Every good thing that comes for the benefit of man, the Devil takes possession of: the radio, for instance. What a wonderful instrument it is, what a means to educate the people, and yet ninety per cent of the programs that come over the radio should not be heard at all. You can hardly ever turn one on without hearing a tobacco ad, a very alluring one, or something else of an evil nature. In the programs, many of them, that are given for entertainment, things are presented that are, well, shady; the jokes, and all these things are listened to by our young people. How can they grow up in the knowledge of the truth, in the love of the truth, with such things before them? Another thing we ought to keep our children from, and you as mothers should use your influence, is the public dance. I do not know of 807 anything which is a greater evil than the public dance, where, promiscuously, people gather, no questions asked as long as they pay their price, and out of it comes sin. Again, may I, dare I, speak about it, even to you mothers, of modern dress. It is not what the Lord has indicated he would have. He gave to the Church a law which you can find recorded in section 42 of the Doctrine and Covenants, in which he says, "Let all thy garments be plain, and their beauty the beauty of the work of thine own hands," but they are not. I am speaking of the women's dress. I do not think they dress modestly. 'This comes from the world and we partake very largely of these fashions. I suppose perhaps the women think they are pleasing the men. From my understanding, and considering the men [ associate with, they are not pleased, not at all. Men in the world may be, I do not know, but not men in the Church, Latter-day Saints. And why do we have to follow the customs and the fashions of the world? OW, there are so many other things that are evil I cannot take time to mention them, that are placed before our people today, both old and young, and I want to tell you sisters, many among us cannot help, when we see things constantly, from being influenced. All the time we have portrayed before us the advertisements of tobacco and liquor, and all kinds of ads in the magazines, that are unwholesome. In some magazines that many among us like to buy, there are pictures of scantily dressed women. Can we expect our young people to grow up very much with the spirit of the 808. Gospel in them under such conditions? I wonder if we, ourselves, are not more or less affected by it, seeing and hearing these things constantly. Now, the papers are telling us all the time that the condition throughout this nation is terrible in regard to divorce. We find it right here among our own people. There was a time when divorce was much less within the Church than it is today, but in recent years it has been increasing. Why? All of these modem sins tend to it, everything to weaken and destroy the influence of the home. People are losing the love for the home, for the family, today, and that brings upon us these divorce difficulties. And so many of our young people are not looking upon marriage as the Lord would have them look upon it. They do not realize what it means. They are willing to be married outside of the Temple. Why? Because _ their mothers, particularly so their mothers, have failed to teach them the proper kind of marriage. Fathers have failed also, but the mothers are with the children more of the time in the home. And young people born under the covenant are being married outside of the Church, or outside of the Temple, and ofttimes we see in the papers their pictures, and the parents seem to be elated over it, and so they put the pictures in the papers and advertise the fact that the marriage is to be outside the Temple. I should thing they would be ashamed. May I tell you this? In the early days of my life, occasionally my father would hold a meeting with his family, and he would talk to us. And he has told us in those meetings, RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�DECEMBER 1946 time and time again, he would rather take his children to the grave and lay them away, knowing that they were in their purity and entitled to come up in the resurrection to receive the blessings of exaltation in the Kingdom of God, than to have them marry out of the Church or out of the Temple if that would deprive them of these blessings, which it would, unless they should repent. And yet a lot of our people are teaching their sons and their daughters that it does not matter. It comes to my attention that mothers are telling their daughters not to go to the Temple. When they get old then they can go to the Temple, but they do not want to go to the Temple until they get old, until their "charms," whatever that means, have disappeared. Maybe you know what that means. I do not think a woman's charms should ever disappear. I do not think age should make the difference. And so I would like to read to you just one paragraph that I wrote a long time ago, and that is all I will have time to do: Nothing is more pitiful than to see a broken, dismembered family where husband and wife have separated and children know not what to do. Sad are the stories which come to the officials in the Temples and difficult are the problems which they are asked to unravel. Parents, think of your children. Do not let petty troubles, trifling difficulties and misunderstandings come between you. Children have a right to the blessings of the sacred' union, love and happiness which belong to the family. They have an eternal claim upon their parents, and when these parents, through some foolishness, some whim or needless anger, permit themselves to be separated, the children are the great sufferers. What will the Lord (Continued on page 843) The Place of Relief Society in the Welfare Plan Elder Harold B. Lee Of the Council of the Twelve [Delivered at the officers' meeting of the general Relief Society conference, held in the Assembly Hall, Thursday morning, October 3, 1946.] T is not likely that I shall say anything new to you on this subject of the Relief Society in the Church Welfare Program, and | shall only attempt this morning to lay down a few general, broad principles that might aid you as Relief Society leaders to more clearly see your place and to fill it, in the accomplishment of that which we have been assigned to do under what has been popularly, or otherwise, known as the Church Welfare Plan. I should first like to discuss the relationship that the Relief Society organization has to the Priesthood. The Apostle Paul said to the Corinthians: Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord (I Cor. 11:11). Now, while that had reference to marriage, I would like to paraphrase that to give strength to this point: Neither the brethren of the Priesthood can succeed in the Welfare Program without the sisters of the Relief Society, nor can the Relief Society succeed without the brethren of the Priesthood. President Joseph F. Smith, who has analyzed for us this relationship, has made two very significant expressions on this subject at various times, and I read those statements: I have in mind our auxiliary organizations; What are they? Helps to the standard organizations of the Church. They are not independent. I want to say to the Young Men's and Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement Associations, and to the Relief Society, and to the Primaries, and to the Sunday Schools... And all the rest of the organizations in the Church, that not one of them is independent of the Priesthood of the Son of God. Not any of them can exist a moment in the acceptance of the Lord when they withdraw from the voice and from the counsel of those who hold the Priesthood and preside over them. 'They are subject to the powers and authority of the Church, and they are not independent of them; nor can they exercise any rights in their organizations independently of the Priesthood and of the Church (President Joseph F. Smith, Gospel Doctrine, page 479). And then he said this: We expect to see the day, if we live long enough, and if some of us do not live long enough to see it, there are others who will, when every council of the Priesthood in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will understand its duty�will assume its own responsibility, will magnify its calling and fill its place in the Church to the utmost, according to the intelligence and ability possessed by it. When that day shall come, there will not be so much necessity for work that is now being done by the auxiliary organizations because it will be done by the regular quorums of the priesthood (Gospel Doctrine, p. 199, 31d Ed; April C-R_ 1906, page 3). How much time will pass before that will take place none of us know, but until that time comes, we Page 809 must invite and expect the great body of sisters, represented in this leadership here this morning, and the other auxiliary organizations, to give assistance to the Priesthood as they are now expected to do. There will be said to you in every stake welfare meeting where our General Committee members assemble with you, there will be said in the General Welfare meeting which will be held Saturday morning in the Tabernacle, beginning at eight o'clock, some of the phases of the essential parts of the Welfare Program that I shall discuss with you here this morning for a few moments. As we see it, after ten and a half years of intensive activity, there are three essentials to an effective program in every stake of the Church if the welfare objectives are to be realized. The first essential is that there must be welfare projects conducted and developed on a permanent basis to produce the commodities adjudged necessary to take care of those who may have to be assisted. AY I be specific as to what we mean by that kind of a project. For that to be realized, our wheat must be produced on land owned and operated by a ward or Priesthood quorum or by the stake. Our beef must be procured from cattle which we pasture, and feed, and slaughter in the Welfare Program. Our milk must be obtained from cows which we own and which are fed with hav and grain which we produce, from cows which are sheltered in sheds and barns, built from lumber which we obtain in the Welfare Program, and milked by brethren who are unemployed and need assistance. And the milk that comes from those cows must be processed in milk plants and in dairies and in condenseries and churns in order to produce the milk and the cheese and the butter that we need to take care of our people. Our shoes must come from hides that we procure from the cattle that we slaughter to provide our meat. And the hides must be tanned in our own tanneries, and manufactured in our own plants which employ people who otherwise would be unemployed, or who must be trained in order to take their place in private industry. I am hoping for the day to come when we can take the raw cotton and the raw wool which we now obtain as an assignment in the Welfare Program and have that raw material spun into yarns, and that yarn woven into cloth, and then have our sisters direct the processing of that cloth we thus produce, into bedding, clothing, mattresses, and the other things we need in the Welfare Program. That is what we mean by permanent welfare projects, and until we move forward in that program to as near the hundred per cent production of our needs in the Welfare Program, we are not striking a maximum efficiency. President Wilford Woodruff made a significant statement, about fifty years ago, in an address that he delivered at the Weber Stake conference, and this is what he said: So far as temporal matters are. Concerned we have got to go to work and provide for ourselves. The day will come when�as we have been told�we shall all see the necessity of making our own shoes and clothing and raising our own' food, 810 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�DECEMBER 1946 RELIEF SOCIETY IN THE WELFARE PLAN and uniting together to carty out the purposes of the Lord. We will be preserved in the mountains of Israel in the day of God's judgment. I, therefore, say to you, my brethren and sisters, prepare for that which is to come ( Weber Stake Conference, Oct. 8, 1894; MS. 56:643-4)- That warning and that prophecy ought not to fall on deaf ears. NOW: where is the place of the Relief Society in the accomplishment of this essential objective? Years ago when the Welfare Program was just getting underway, Surveys were made throughout the Church of the homes where difficulty and want and distress were to be found. We found a very startling situation. In the great majority of those homes�and | would suppose ninety to ninety-five per cent, or even more�the mothers in the homes of most of those families did not know how to bake their own bread; they did not know how to remodel or remake their clothes; they did not know how to preserve fruits and vegetables, and their husbands were unskilled laborers. I want you to look at that picture, you sisters, and then ask yourselves � that kind of a home is prepared to withstand the shock of unemployment and want and distress. We discovered in this Welfare Program that we had lost many of those pioneer skills that made for independence and thrift and industry. Thank the Lord, through the guidance of wise men, we are bringing back some of those old skills; we are learning how to make rugs, and, as I go throughout the Church, I find that after you have made your, shall I say, arduous assignment of rugs, that you have agonized about in many cases, I find that you are finding 811 the opportunity and the materials to make a few of those extra lovely rugs to grace your own homes. It is a splendid thing, as I see, that homemade rugs that you have learned how to make yourselves in the Welfare Program, are finding a place in our homes. Breadmaking, dressmaking, food preservation�there was never a time in our lives when there was as fine 4 training program for the mothers of this Church as there is at the present time '1 those essential and fundamental skills, and may I now impress this one thought: We are failing in this Welfare Program if and when we have mothers of homes receiving assistance who are able bodied and can do so, when they are not brought into the production assignments, in sewing and breadmaking and tug weaving. You Sisters must see to it that all able bodied persons, whose home conditions permit them to do so, brought in to help to be producers in that program from which they receive sustenance. We fail in that, and we fail in one of the prime requirements of the Welfare Program. Even though they may not be able to come to your centers, even though it may require someone being sent into their homes to teach them if they cannot come to a center, you presidents should see to it that someone teaches them, and they have work to do in their own homes where they may have to be surrounded by their own children. There is another essential in this program before we can move forward, and that is that there must be a storehouse, adequately stocked with a full supply of welfare-produced commodities, and within the reach of every bishop, and of course his Relief Society president, who is his right-hand assistant in this work. Now, where do you fit into that Program? As I go throughout the Church, I frequently ask how many presidents have seen the Food Distribution Guide, and I am startled ofttimes to find that not even the stake Relief Society president has ever seen a Food Distribution Guide. You cannot be of very effective assistance in this distribution program unless you know two things: One is that you know what foods are in the storehouse, available for distribution; and the second, that you have some comprehension of the estimated amount families of average size will require. Possession and understanding and use of that Food Distribution Guide will help to answer both questions. Without it, you are in the dark: with it, you become effective tools in the Welfare Program. Now, in order for you to give that kind of assistance, there is another thing you must know and_ understand. What are the resources that the Church has, or you might call them assets, in order to solve an individual welfare problem? How do you start to solve it? Suppose I should ask you this question at this time. Suppose that tonight a telephone call comes to the father of a family where he is at work, bringing him the distressing word that his little son has been hit with an automobile and has been rushed to the hospital, critically injured. This family is making only a very low income, just barely enough to keep the family together with food and the essentials. Now there faces the family immediately, a doctor bill, a hospital bill�how in the world are you going to handle it? I fear if I should ask you that question and have you answer it here, most of you would say: "Well, we will call on the fast offering funds." And that is not the way the Welfare Program begins, and that is where we make our error. In the first place, we start out with the individual himself. We do not move from that point until we have helped the individual to do all he can to help his own problem. Now, sentiment and our emotional sympathy might push us to other conclusions, but that is the first, and then we reach out to the immediate relatives of that family. We are losing the family solidarity, we are losing the strength that comes from family unity, when we fail to give opportunity and to help to direct a way by which immediate relatives of that family, so distressed, can come to the aid of their own. HEN, the next point we move to is to call on the storehouse for the immediate necessities. In a home like that I have just described, I want you to see the advantage of giving to that family the clothing, the food, bedding, fuel that they need for a couple of months in order to relieve the cash that they otherwise would spend to pay for that emergency hospital bill, rather than merely taking fast offerings and passing it out to them in money. In the instance of giving commodities from the storehouse, you are merely giving that family a drawing account on the commodities which they themselves have helped to produce, or that have been exchanged for that which they 812 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�DECEMBER 1946 RELIEF SOCIETY IN THE WELFARE PLAN helped to produce. You will find that which we receive as compensation in that indirect way for work done, will uplift and preserve the pride and help that individual to be more independent than if we start with this other and easiest course, without following the Welfare way. Now, beyond what you can do from the storehouse, then the next thing, of course, is to recommend to the bishop the use of the fast offering fund, which, he has been schooled, is to be used first from that which he provides from his own efforts and the efforts of his leaders. To that end, we must always put the gathering of fast offerings and the increasing of the fast offerings, and teaching the law of fasting, as one of the foremost parts of the Welfare Plan. In some places we have got away from that, and especially in centers where they have not many people in need. But keep in mind the law of the fast, and the increasing of fast offerings to a point where everybody is fasting from two meals and paying the full equivalent cost of those two meals as a contribution. That is one of the prime things to provide the substance to meet that. In this teaching, the Relief Society has a responsibility. Now then, following from that, we come to the rehabilitation aspects of our problems. There the Relief Society, and there the Priesthood quorums play their major part. Now what is the Relief Society's part in a rehabilitation program? Well, the first thing you do, as you visit the home of a distressed family, is to do as the bishop requires, make an analysis of the conditions of the home. I am going to talk about that in a few moments to indicate 813 why I think the Lord has given us a marvelous program in sending sisters of your attainments into such homes. OU go there to make the analysis, find out conditions, and to make an order on the storehouse, if that be necessary, and report back to your bishop the needs of the family for his approval and withdrawal from the storehouse, or from funds that he has in his Possession, if that be necessary. The second thing you do is to make certain that the home management problems of that home are studied, and that there be set in motion such direction that will help to cure the evils that are there. You must stand ready to meet home emergencies, sickness, death, and other conditions of that kind, that call upon a sisterly sympathy that ought to be expressed by the Relief Society Then, too, you must be always morale builders in this part of the program. Yours must be the uplifting hand, yours the one to steady the family situation through the emergency. As I think about this part of the program, I realize how keenly you folks need, and how you desire, a close relationship with your brethren in the Priesthood, and that brings me to the third essential before this Program can succeed. | know sometimes when | mention this, now, you feel yourselves quite helpless, but I am going to urge you to be a little more patient, a little more energetic in urging. The third is that there must be a regular weekly meeting of the Ward Welfare Committee, and there must be a monthly meeting of the Stake Welfare Committee which supervises the work of the ward. We cannot go forward without that essential meeting together. Now, sisters, I think you, in your kindly way�and keep in mind that these men who preside in the ward as bishops and Priesthood leaders are husbands and fathers; you are their wives and you have a lot of training in how to get a man into action�you can now use those tactics where necessary, kindly, but effectively, in seeing that the weekly Ward Welfare Committee meeting is held. I would like to think this: A wife in a home, a woman, is expected to be not just a scrub woman and a housekeeper, but she is expected to be an intelligent and inspired participant in the family partnership. That is just where we think the place of the Relief Society is in the Welfare Program. We do not expect that the Relief Society shall merely be scrub women and housekeepers. We expect that they shall be invited in as intelligent participants in the planning of the Welfare partnership, and without that invitation and without that opportunity, we are not going to get the solidarity that we otherwise could expect. O may we ask you sisters to redouble your efforts to see that that meeting is held. Once a month is not often enough. A meeting that is only held when it is thought it is necessary is never held. We know that. That is a pure subterfuge. This meeting, to be effective, must be held regularly and that regularity must be once a week, and the only places where the Welfare Program is moving forward as it should is in those wards where they are holding the weekly Welfare Committee meeting, properly supervised by an active Stake Welfare Committee. Now, I should like to call your attention to another thing that the Lord has said by revelation, that describes his plan. In the 104th Section of the Doctrine and Covenants, I think the 14th verse, the Lord says this. And in these few words, if we understand them as I am sure the Lord wants us to understand them, we have as clearly defined in as few words the Welfare Program as anything I know. Now listen to what the Lord says: I, the Lord, stretched out the heavens, and built the earth, my very handiwork; and all things therein are mine. And it is my purpose to provide for my saints. Now, you listen to that when somebody tells you that we pay taxes and we ought to turn our people onto public relief. Did you hear what the Lord said? It is my purpose to provide for my saints, for all things are mine... But it must needs be done in mine own way. Not the Government's way, not some crackpot philosopher's way, but it is to be done in the Lord's way: And behold this is the way that I, the Lord, have decreed to provide for my saints. Now, get the significance of this one statement: That the poor shall be exalted, in that the rich are made low. Now, that is the plan. I am going to speak of that for just a moment. Then the Lord goes on to say: For the earth is full, and there is enough and to spare; yea, I prepared all things, and have given unto the children of men to be agents unto themselves. Therefore, 814 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�DECEMBER 1946 RELIEF SOCIETY IN THE WELFARE PLAN if any man shall take of the abundance which I have made, and impart not his portion, according to the law of my gospel, unto the poor and the needy, he shall, with the wicked, lift up his eyes in hell, being in torment. 'There are your fast offerings, there is your tithing. Now, what does he mean by this phrase? His way is, "that the poor shall be exalted, in that the rich are made low" (Doc. And Cov. 104:14-18). "Exalt," in the. Language of the dictionary, and the definition that I am sure the Lord is trying to convey means: ""To lift up with pride and joy to success." That is how we should lift the poor up, "with pride and joy to success," and how are we to do it? By the rich being made low. Now, do not mistake that word "rich." That does not always mean a man who has a lot of money. That man may be poor in money,' but he may be rich in skill. He may be rich in judgment. He may be rich in good example. He may be rich in splendid optimism, and in a lot of other qualities that are necessary. And when individual Priesthood quorum members unite themselves together, we usually find all those rare qualities necessary to lift up the needy and distressed with pride and joy to success in the accomplishment. There could not be a more perfect working of the Lord's plan than that. Now, keep in mind this further thought, that the Lord has told us time and again that the objective of all his work is spiritual. Do you remember what he said in the 29th section of the Doctrine and Covenants? Wherefore, verily I say unto you that all things unto me are spiritual, and not 815 at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal; neither any man, nor the children of men; neither Adam, your father, whom I created (Doc. And Cov. 29:34). Can you see that in your handling of these affairs? Do you let everything you do be with an eye single to the glory of that individual, the ultimate triumph of his spiritual over his physical? The whole purpose of the Lord in life is to so help us and direct us that at the end of our lives we are prepared for a celestial inheritance. Is not that it? Can you give every basket of food you give, can you give every service that you render with that great objective in mind? Is this the way to do it in order to help my brother or my sister to better attain and lay hold upon his celestial inheritance? That is the objective that the Lord sets. OW, if that be the objective, cannot you see how important it is that you, as the presidents of the Relief Society make such an approach that will determine in large part whether or not we succeed or whether or not we fail? Well, as I thought about this subject and worried about it in the last few weeks, realizing what a fearsome task it was to stand here and talk to you, this many sisters, I got to thinking about this thing called sympathy, and I went into the psychology books and I found a psychologist dividing sympathy into three categories. First, he said, there is the kind of sympathy that is a sort of self-pity. We go with this feeling, "My, I feel sorry for you,' which is another way of saying, "If I were in your place, I do not think I would be able to go through it." And I thought back on my _ experience and I remembered meeting a man who was dying with cancer. The doctor had told him that he could not live for another month. My companion and I walked into his sick room, and before we had a chance to say anything, he said: "Do you know, brethren, I am going to get a big club and stand it right here by my bed?" We told him that that was a rather interesting introduction to friends, and asked: "What are you going to use that club for?" He replied: "I am going to hit the next man over the head who says to me, 'I feel sorry for you.'" Now, is that the kind of sympathy that uplifts? I fear not. 66" RHERE is another kind of sympathy," the psychologist said, "that follows convention rather than tells the truth and that fails in making people face the facts by telling them the truth." Then he, to illustrate that, told about a rich woman who was lying there with all her fineries, dressed in a beautiful gown, lying there with a mysterious ailment that no one could diagnose, and one of her friends came to her on this occasion and she said: "O I wish I were with Jesus." The visitor said to her: "You have no right to be with him. Your place is to get up from this bed and take care of your husband and your children as you ought to." Oh, she did not like it, but that was the truth, and stirred by that "sympathy," that kind of sympathy, she got up from her bed and her mysterious ailment began to cure itself. I saw that in my own office over here in the distant past, and I think I can tell it without anyone knowing of whom I speak. We had someone who was very much in distress, so she thought, and needed a sum of money, rather a large sum, and she came, thinking that it might be borrowed from the Welfare Program. We had discussed the whole question. We felt it was not the proper way to apply these sacred funds that are entrusted to the Welfare Committee by the First Presidency, and so we said, "No," and I was the one who had to say "No." I learned to say "No" in more languages than I had ever known before, over there. And she became angry at first and then she cried� and that is always a weapon a woman uses on a man�but fortunately, I guess, for the Church, I could not be the only one affected, and she could not cry before all who had said "No," and, finally, she began to plead, and then she began to argue. Well, I went through a distressing hour but there sat at my side a very wise man and, finally, when she paused, he said to her: "May I tell you a story?" And he told her the story of Joseph sold into Egypt, and he said: "You remember the eleven brothers that were up there toasting their shins in Canaan! They could hear the lowing of the cattle out in the farmyard. 'There were pans of milk in the pantry and they had all they wanted to eat, and it was warm inside. Their brother was down in a dungeon in jail in Egypt, but despite all their comfort, by comparison, they were very poor indeed, because Joseph in the dungeon could walk and talk with God." 816 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�DECEMBER 1946 RELIEF SOCIETY IN THE WELFARE PLAN I think I have never seen a woman change so. She looked at him fora few moments as the full import of that great lesson came upon her, and she brightened her tears and said: "I know what you mean. I, too, have a way." The truth, sometimes, is the most difficult kind of sympathy to give, but ofttimes it is the most effective. Never let your sympathy be merely the conventional kind, just because you think you say what they would like to have you say, when you know that what your sympathy is saying is not the truth. But this last, and this valued kind of sympathy, is the kind that I want you to exercise, if you would be helpful to this Program, and that is the sympathy that is not merely trying to see another one's problems through your eyes, but it is the sympathy that tries to see their trouble through their eyes. It is the kind of sympathy that tries to put oneself in the place of the sufferer. I want you to think about that for a moment. I listened to one of our leaders tell me about how he approached the knotty problems that came in their council meetings, and he said: "When it gets to a point where I do not know which way to turn and what to answer, I sit for a few moments and reflect if the Master were here in our place�and this is his work�how would the Master set about it. What would be his answer to this problem? And then I begin to see how kindly he approached his tasks. I begin to see how he got into the individual hearts of his people." When I heard our leader describing his approach I thought of the 817 picture that I had seen of Jesus sitting on the seashore, teaching old Zebedee and his two sons, James and John�have you seen the beautiful painting? Old Zebedee, for fifty or more years, has only thought in one groove. He sits there as much as to say: "You try to teach me anything different than I have been thinking." James and John, his younger sons, seem to be listening more intently, but here sits the Master. He has placed his hand kindly on the forearm of this old grizzled veteran, Zebedee. The Master does not seem to be in a hurry. He has no trains to catch nor any appointments to keep. He looks like he can sit there all day and all next week, and all next month if it were necessary. It looks, from the expression on his face, that he is willing to illustrate, to put it anew, to repeat it, if necessary, in order to make it sink in. WELL that is the way. He could teach because he was seeing Zebedee's life through Zebedee's own eyes. That is why he was the perfect teacher. He was not sitting back and trying to make Zebedee see through his eyes. He was trying, as the perfect teacher, to help the learner through his own thinking. I want you, again, to see another picture where Jesus has set us a great example. He is hanged upon the cross. Cruel spikes have been driven into his hands and into his feet. A spear has been thrust in his side to hasten his death. Cruel thorns have been mashed down upon his brow. The blood is now trickling down in his eves and over his cheeks. (Continued on page 841 ) Bruce Redd McConkie Sustained a Member of First Council of Seventy Counselor Marianne C. Sharp THE BRUCE R. McCONKIE FAMILY Elder Bruce R. McConkie, new member of the First Council of Seventy, with his wife, Amelia Smith McConkie, and their children: Vivian, age six; Stanford Smith, age three; Mary Ethel, age five months; Joseph Fielding, age five. N October 6, 1946, Bruce Redd McConkie was_ sustained as a member of the First Council of Seventy, filling the vacancy caused by the death, last May, of Elder John H. Taylor. This action brings to the Council a man thirty-one years of age, one in the full vigor and power of mind and body, called to become one of the "traveling ministers unto the Gentiles first and also unto the Jews." Elder McConkie comes to this high calling richly endowed by native ability, parental training, and self-improvement. Page 818 He was reared in a house of faith where his parents, Oscar W. McConkie and Vivian Redd McConkie, taught the gospel by precept and also by daily example. Asa young boy, Bruce exhibited those traits of character that a BRUCE REDD McCONKIE Latter-day Saint teacher would wish in a student. He was a thoughtful, obedient lad of a sober disposition, faithful and true, courteous in all his actions, but ever ready to defend the truth. Even as a child, he possessed an unusual knowledge of the scriptures, and, as he has grown to full maturity, his early promise has been realized, until today he is of such a stature that the Lord, through his servants, has chosen him as one to help carry on his great work in these latter days. Brother McConkie has had thorough training and outstanding experience in his chosen profession �the law. He spent four years in the army engaged in security and intelligence work and, during those years, he was promoted from a first lieutenant to a lieutenant colonel. He comes well trained to his new calling, for he has been serving as senior president of the 340th Quorum of Seventy in Monument Park Ward of Bonneville Stake. He will receive full support in his 819 devoted wife, Amelia Smith McConkie, daughter of Elder Joseph Fielding Smith of the Quorum of the Twelve and the late Ethel Reynolds Smith. Sister McConkie's home training has been such as to give her an understanding and appreciation of the added responsibilities which, as the wife of a General Authority, will be hers in rearing her children during the times when her husband will be absent from home on his Church duties. Relief Society women will feel particularly well acquainted with the McConkie family since the mothers of both Brother and Sister McConkie served, for many years, as faithful and capable members of the Relief Society General Board. Elder McConkie assumes his new duties with a keen sense of the honor and responsibility which have come to him so early in life, and he can be relied upon to give to the Lord's work full measure, running over, of his great faith, devotion, new Church assignment from his pa CHRISTMAS-EVE MAGIC Mary J.

(The Christmas silhouettes upon the snow; The childish whisper; the feet upon the stairs; The smell of spices; the holly berries' glow; Accentuate a world released from cares. ) Above it all a star is standing by Until the gleams from proteges are found, And then it leads the way across the sky To shine once more on pure and holy ground.

ASHTON On October 9, 1946, all that was mortal of Bishop Marvin O. Ashton was laid to rest in the Sunset Lawn Cemetery, Salt Lake City, Utah, attended by a vast concourse of people eager to pay tribute to the man they loved. He lived abundantly, generously, and finished superbly. In the afternoon of the last day of his life, he preached a great sermon before the general conference of the Church; and while the words scarcely ceased Page 820 A GREAT Commoner has gone. Echoing in the hearts of those who listened, he passed away. Death came in his sleep early the following morning. Three score and three years make up the span of his mortal days. His way of doing things was different, original, individualistic. Marvin Ashton was interested in widows, orphans, poor people, and boys. No better example of Christian living can be found than the record of his deeds. "He went about doing good." The philosophy of his life was made up of common sense, human kindness, generosity, and humor. He was a rare type of man� one of the common people grown great, indeed a great commoner. There are few such men. You rarely meet them, and when you do, you never forget them. People in need of help went to Bishop Ashton and he never failed them. He was a good citizen, a devoted husband, a great father, a delightful companion, a friend of youth, and a leader whom the people loved to follow. The entire Church and the community have sustained an irreparable loss in his passing. He has left behind a sweet and shining memory and sons and daughters worthy of the name they bear. Chiefest among the mourners is the wonderful woman who has walked by his side for forty years, the mother of his children. May the sweet influence that emanates from above comfort and solace her heart and the hearts of all who mourn. Christmas and the True Christian Spirit Elder T. Edgar Lyon HE festive season known as Christmas is more universally celebrated by Christians than any other seasonal _ tradition. Although it is usually thought of as the birthday of the Savior, both historical evidence and modern revelation indicate that Jesus of Nazareth was born in the springtime. In the early centuries, the birth of the Savior was celebrated in various places in January, March, April, and May. Apparently, the celebration of Christ's birth was established on December 25th because of pagan influence. Prior to the Christian era, this day and others, a few days before and after it, had been celebrated by pagan peoples as the feast of the winter solstice or the birthday of Mithras, one of the most popular pagan deities. It appears that Christian leaders finally decided, after attempting to suppress these pagan feasts, without success, to designate December 25th as the birthday of Christ. Many ancient pagan customs, such as the use of holly and mistletoe, the yule log, lighted trees, spiced punches, and fruitcake, were kept as part of the celebration, because they were such powerful social traditions, and the new symbolism gave to them Christian meanings. In America, the celebration of Christmas became further complicated and farther removed from the real spirit of Christianity through the addition of the mystical figure of Saint Nicholas, or Santa Claus, as he has come to be popularly designated. Until less than three centuries ago, there was no relation between Saint Nicholas and Christmas. But, when the Netherlands acquired a colonial foothold in the New World, and sent their colonists to New Amsterdam and the Hudson Valley, these sturdy Dutchmen brought with them the tradition of St. Nicholas. According to their tradition, St. Nicholas was a bishop of Myra (a | city in Asia Minor) who served his flock of Christians early in the fourth century. He had been a man of wealth, and, upon becoming a Christian bishop, had used his means to aid the unfortunate and to make children happy, recalling the saying of Jesus, "of such is the kingdom of heaven." In doing this, he had been attempting to follow the teachings of Jesus and the early Christian leaders, who had stressed service to their fellow men as the greatest manifestation of the love of God that could come into the human soul. In the true Christian spirit of neither seeking nor allowing public acclaim for deeds of charity and love, he swore all his benefactors to secrecy. Following his death, however, many of the people whom he had aided told of his munificence, and his fame spread Page 821 far and wide into Europe, the Near East, and parts of Asia. Popular tradition created of him a supernatural figure who went about once a year, distributing gifts. In America, "St. Nicholas" became corrupted by the Dutch children into "Sinter Klaas," which was soon shortened into "Santa Claus." When the British assumed possession of the colonies of the Netherlands, they attempted to suppress the annual visits of the Saint, because of his Catholic background. The Dutch settlers, however, unwilling to rob their children of the annual festival which meant so much to them, changed the time of the traditional visit of St. Nicholas to coincide with Christmas, and his clothing was changed from the robe of a Catholic bishop to that of a resident of a northern land. In this manner, Santa Claus, as we know the tradition, is a creation that occurred on American soil, having been adapted from an old-world background. ODAY, many young people in America make no distinction between the celebration of Christmas, and the annual visit of Santa Claus. Because of the fact that tangible toys and gifts are found in the wake of his nocturnal visits, Santa Claus, the intruder, is often in their thoughts more than Jesus, whose birthday is being commemorated. Due to the great commercial opportunities which the Santa Claus celebration has created, we feel certain that he is here to stay. We cannot oust the usurper. But there are things that individuals and families within the Church can do to counteract some of the commercial elements of this part of Christmas, and substitute for it a truer Christian spirit that will survive throughout life. Latter-day Saint parents are often heard to complain: "There was not so much commercialism about Christmas when I was young as there is today." This lament is only relatively true. There was a great deal of commercialism a half century or more ago, but two factors made it seem less. One was the fact that people had little money to spend compared to what is available today, and so there was not the production of the vast amount of Christmas goods that we have today. It is true that children received less, but, in proportion to the available money, it was probably about as great as present expenditures. The second factor in the growth of the commercialization of Christmas has been the development of more effective advertising. Formerly a paper was limited in its size because it was hand set and hand printed. Yet a perusal of daily papers of fifty or seventy-five years ago indicates that a good portion of their limited advertising space was occupied with appeals to purchase Christmas gifts and the necessary luxuries for sumptuous Christmas dinners. 'Today, with mechanical typesetters and automatic speed presses, daily papers can be made large enough to carry both advertising and news. Alluring advertisements, impossible before the advent of photoengraving, now urge us to buy gifts for Christmas. The radio carries the appeal into our homes, and lighted window displays, decorated streets, and Christmas carols 822 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�DECEMBER 1946 broadcasted from Powerful public address system, - create an atmosphere that makes gift buying inevitable. Our increased standard of living and the powerful commercial appeals of today are factors which threaten Latter-day Saints with their greatest challenge to enhance the true significance of Christ's birth as a mortal. We could not change these habits and Practices of the world even if we desired. Although We are aware that December 2 5th is not the true birthday of Jesus, we hardly care to ignore the traditional season when others celebrate the event. What, then, can we do to make Christmas a Christ-centered event and cultivate the spirit of giving which he exemplified, in the midst of a Santa Claus-minded world? OME of the fondest memories of childhood that an adult carries into mature life are the remembrances of Christmas at home and in church. We recall such things as the tension of mystery that was about the house before Christmas, the odors of the holiday foods, the plans for special parties, the anticipation of the surprises that awaited on Christmas morning, and the abundance of wonderful gifts that were received; the beautiful music of the Christmas carols, the cheerfulness of the Christmas tree, with its colored lights; the Preparation of baskets of food or gifts for the less fortunate in the neighborhood; the special Sunday School programs and the singing of the little children; a special Christmas sermon at sacrament meeting, and Prayers of gratitude for the gift of the Christ Child. These are the memories that live on and on in the minds of men and women long after Christmas has ceased to mean Santa Claus and the hurry and worry of shopping. If Christmas is to remain an impressive event in the lives of our children with its Proper religious significance, parents should carry on some of the practices which were a part of their own youthful observances of Christmas. The first thing that they should do js to make up their minds that they will endeavor to live the Principles of the Christian life in the home at all times. Here is an Opportunity to take stock of oneself and to notice the things in one's conduct that are not in accordance with the teachings of Jesus, such as the loss of self-control, Sarcastic comments to other members of the family, unkind deeds, harsh words, dishonest acts, unwillingness to forgive others, deception and hypocrisy, Christmas time offers the Opportunity of T�-examining our souls to see how far we have departed from Christian forms of living. Christmas also presents us with an opportunity of having the family work together as a unit in unselfish service to others, Not only must we learn the theory of Christian service and brotherly love, but we need a laboratory in which to let the theory function, that the ideal of service may be transformed into a habit of conduct that will become a habitual wav of living throughout life. Bible passages concerning the joy of giving, the value of giving as compared with receiving, and the great love that God had for the world which caused him to give his Only Begotten Son to save it, can be used to form the background for this experiment in Christian living. CHRISTMAS AND THE TRUE CHRISTIAN SPIRIT 823  Some project should be selected by the family�one of unselfish giving to less fortunate or to lonely people. One should then see to it that each member of the family is given a responsibility that will require time and sacrifices. Even little tots can be taught unselfish service by such activities. 'The parents should not provide everything, but should see to it that each member of the family supplies something by contributing a good toy, a nearly new doll, or some of his Christmas money. No better method of teaching unselfishness and sympathy for others can be found than such a project. Those who have tried such activities on a family basis bear testimony to its great value and wholesome effect on the outlook of their children. United activities of this type are the finest manifestation of Christian teaching. Throughout this season of the year, great stress should be placed on the spiritual aspect of Christmas. Plans should be made to have the family group read together the inspiring story of the nativity as found in Luke 2:1-20. For very small children, perhaps, a first reading from a Bible storybook would be helpful. In addition, the family could make much of carol singing at such a time. Libraries have many publications containing the story of the composing of famous Christmas carols. Such information makes the singing of a carol more meaningful. The family could plan a home Christmas service, with carols sung, played by instrument, or heard from records. Each child could participate with the story of a carol, and a Bible reading. Here, it is interesting to note that the timeless words and music of our beautiful carols all deal with the advent of Jesus and the joy that the world has found in this event. Youth is a time when ideals are most readily fixed in the mind, an age of spontaneous enthusiasm for things new, a period of simple religious faith and confidence, the most receptive time for teaching those values that should last throughout life, and the period of greatest habit formation. Parents who utilize the teaching possibilities of the Christmas season will accomplish four things: They will impress their children with the needs and values of the true Christian way of life; they will encourage in them habits of unselfish service which will last throughout life; they will instill in their children the spiritual enjoyment of participating in religious services; and last, but by no means least, they will give to their children a rich treasure of memories of true Christmas joy to carry throughout their lives.

It is the fitting time to make our homes as attractive and Magic changes festive as possible. Are easily achieved by little touches here and there. The fireplace is the focal point of the room. We can make it ornamental and gay for the holiday season. Greens tied together and festooned over the mantel. Colored Christmas tree ornaments at the center and the sides. Or red candles, lend a graceful air. For bright accents, tie Candelabra, with white Page 825 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�DECEMBER 1946 Holly is always symbolical of Christmas. Bank it along the mantel with bright candles. Candles of different lengths are most effective, and they are beautiful in a group of three. Place a piece of celotex or a square of cork or heavy cardboard over the mantel. Frame it with greens, cedar, pine, fir, or holly. Attach your Christmas cards with thumb tacks to the square. This is very gay. Perhaps you have a lovely old copper tray or a bright plate. Either of these used as a background for a single candle, with a few sprigs of pine, will make a very effective arrangement. CHRISTMAS ON THE MANTEL Decorate your mantel with symbolic Christmas figurines: the Wise Men from the East, bringing gifts to the Child in the cradle. Candles and pine boughs form the background. If your fireplace is a modern one, without a mantel, pin a large bow of bright red tarlatan or silk above the grate. Attach pine cones, holly, and little bells to the bow. If you have a pet antique, such as an old clock, dress it up with greens and see how distinctive it becomes, telling the time for the holidays. Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, December 1, and December 15, 1886 "For THE RIGHTS OF. THE Women of ZION; AND THE RIGHTs OF THE Women OF ALL Nations" ESSAY ON CHRISTMAS: Christmas time, of all the year, is a time of rejoicing for all Christian sects. It is a time of festivity and merrymaking, and I sometimes think that in our mirth and pleasure we are apt to forget the real and most worthy cause of joy and rejoicing�the birth of our Savior, the babe in Bethlehem, the meek and lowly Jesus, who came to this earth in the meridian of time, as it had been ordained in the courts above, before the creation of this world....

Tom Clark, Attorney 'General of the United States, acting for the Department of Justice, called a national conference on juvenile delinquency for November, in Washington, D.

VOL. 33 DECEMBER 1946 NO. 12 A Sie That Binds "And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the babe lying in a manger" (Luke 2:16). THs family scene of father, mother, and child greeted the shepherds early on the morning of the first Christmas day. How appropriate that the succeeding Christmas celebrations down through the years have centered about the family. Most of the beloved traditions surrounding this holiday are directly concerned with the family observance of this day. Many people have been heard to say, "After all, Christmas is just for the children." But Christmas is also for the parents. Yuletide brings parents an opportunity to establish family traditions and customs that tie and bind the family group together. As children grow into adults, and the world, with its influences, intrudes with increasing force into their lives, very often it is the observance of a family Christmas tradition that strengthens the influence of a wholesome family and weakens the outside forces. Mothers are unusually busy at Christmas time, and it would be easy to exclude the children from many of the preparations they find exciting. The memory of a dear little grandmother making "curly gingerbread," by a recipe brought Page 230 from England in the early 1860's, cheerily singing an old English ballad "The Mistletoe Bough" to entertain and make happy the grandchildren clustered around her, has not only enriched each Christmas season for one woman, but has inspired her to try to adopt the virtues of an unusually fine and spiritual grandmother. A mother began, with her first child, a custom that has become dear to each child as he joined the family circle. On Christmas Eve, the very last thing before being tucked into bed, the mother and her children sit before the fireplace where the stockings are hung, and the mother reads the story of the birth of the Christ Child. Even the tiniest child, too young to understand the full import of the story, knows the pictures and knows that Christmas is celebrated not only because of Santa Claus, but more important because the birth of little "baby Jesus" is celebrated on that day. Yes, Christmas is for patents, as well as for children. Let this season of peace and good will make the Christmas celebration a tie to bind the family group together. G. R. G. Yn Memoriam Grace Elizabeth Pack Callis HE General Board of Relief Society and the membership in all the stakes and missions of the Church pay tribute at this time to an outstanding and greatly loved Latter-day Saint woman Grace Elizabeth Pack Callis. Sister Callis, wife of Elder Charles A. Callis, passed away October 12, 1946, at the age of seventy-three. Her life was filled with the satisfaction and happiness that come from devoted and unselfish service. A helpful and gifted wife, Sister Callis accompanied her husband on many of his missionary journeys, and, with him, spent nearly twenty-eight years in the Southern States Mission. There she organized and directed the activities of the Relief Societies and Young Women's Mutual Improvement Associations. She was an inspirational speaker, and her lovable personality attracted many sincere friends. After Brother Callis became an apostle, Sister Callis accompanied him on visits to ten missions, including the Hawaiian and the Japanese. She was the mother of eight children, six of whom were born in the South. She will long be remembered as an ideal woman who achieved a rich fulfillment of her life as a wife. Mother, and a faithful worker in the Church she loved. THE STAR STILL SHINES Jeanette P. Parry I do not mind dark Christmas skies tonight, And ruthless winds invading naked trees; The selfsame star still shines on Bethlehem That brought the frightened shepherds to their knees. I wish I might have heard the angels sing When all the world in silver silence lay, And Mary, mother of the Son of God, Delivered, rested on the manger hay. I do not see him on a rough hewn cross With crown of cruel thorns upon his head; I see the glory of the virgin's smile That left a halo on his lowly bed. The memory still glows in spite of evil deeds, Of fear and greed and hearts bowed low with pain, He walks upon the hills to give us hope His star will shine in all the world again.

Yost ING Winter laid his ermine K carpet of snow in readiness for the coming yuletide. Strings of gay, colored lights winked from every shrub and pine. Festive wreaths hung on the doors. Every house on Oak Street seemed ready to greet the eve of Christmas except one. Even inside that house, however, a pudding bubbled on the kitchen coal range, permeating the air with its fragrance and steaming the windows to invisibility. Granny Crockett stood at her worktable, stuffing the last morsel of dressing into the fat rooster, but her heart was heavy. It was mighty hard rearing Mary and Baill, her two grandchildren, in this fast age, when she herself was nearing seventy. It had been a struggle for Granny both financially and physically, since her son Ronald and his wife Vie and two of their children had been killed in an automobile accident. Granny well remembered the day. She had been tending Mary, the tiny baby, for them and Bill, who was eight, had been left with her to help out. That span of eight gapping years between them, had somehow made the job of rearing them even more of a problem, and now Bill was in college, studying law. Granny thought of the problems at hand. Bill had come home from college the week before, but he seemed changed. He never stayed at home. And he hung around Sue Rankin's far too much, Girl friends Page 834 meant added problems, knew only too well. Then, too, there was something wrong with Mary. Granny had given the child every chance to pow out her troubles on Granny's shoulder, but to no avail. A child of twelve should have been bubbling over with the Christmas spirit, but Mary seemed quiet and solemn. "Mary dear, bring Granny a threaded needle to sew up this fowl." Granny's face wrinkled into a smile made of many tiny crow's-feet. Granny "Yes, Granny." Mary's ? face flushed. "Land sakes, child, you don't mind havin' chicken 'stead of turkey this Christmas, do ya?" "Oh, no, Granny. Turkey couldn't be half as good as you cook chicken." "Is it cause of not havin' a tree this year?" "No, Granny, I don't mind going without a tree, honest. We can save that much toward Bill's fare back to school." Mary brought the thread to Granny. She glanced at the clock. It was almost six. She caught a sob before it did any damage. It was hard keeping things from Granny. She was wise as two, maybe three, owls. The clock itself somehow brought back everything to Mary. 'The remembrance of the night Bill had come home from college to spend the holidays moved before her, as a motion picture run too rapidly, and blurred a little. PRELUDE TO CHRISTMAS It had been a Friday evening. Mary had been sitting on her bed counting out her Christmas money. Three dollars and ninety-eight cents altogether. Mary had seen a lovely, lavender, hand-knit shawl of wool, with tiny flowers embroidered on it, and had decided it was the very present for Granny. Mary could imagine her with the shawl wrapped about her shoulders, her eyes shining kind of moist, and her soft gray hair falling in waves over her ears. The shawl had been marked two dollars, and it was a real bargain, So Mary had set aside two dollars in a separate pile, for the shawl. In another store, Mary had seen the cleverest perfume sets. Five tiny bottles, each holding a different scent, dressed like quintuplets. On the lids of each bottle had been painted a face, and each per fume doll had worn a different colored ribbon dress. Marty knew Carma and Reah, her best friends, would simply adore such a gift, so she had set aside another dollar for two sets of perfume. That had left ninety-seven cents for stationery for Bill, and wrapping paper and ribbon. Yes, there would be just enough money, and, as tomorrow was Saturday, she would do her shopping then. Just then a tap had been heard on her door. Mary had quickly gathered up the money, and tucked it in its hiding place, and gone to open the door. "Can I come in, Sis?" almost whispered. "Sure!" Mary had closed the door behind him. Bill was tall and bronzed, a living reminder of the summer that was Bill had 835 past. He had sat on the edge of Mary's bed. "Got any money?" in his cheeks twitched. "M'm-h'm." "Say, Mary, I got roped in on a theater party with Sue and the gang tonight, and I haven't a ted cent." Their eyes had met in the mirror, above Mary's dresser, and Bill had rushed on to explain: "J just can't ask Granny for spending money: Could you make me a loan?" Then he had added coyly, "Mary, old pal." Mary had visualized her money. She could spare maybe a dollar and a half. She guessed she could give Carma and Reah hankies instead of the perfume sets. She could buy cheaper stationery for Bill. But Granny must have that very shawl! Mary had gone to the dresser drawer and fished down under the hankie pile. She had brought out an old watch box and opened jit "How much do you need?" "How much you got?" The muscles M'8* had poured the contents on the dresser scarf. Each coin seemed like an old friend with its own life story. This papet dollar was for cleaning wall paper all day at the Sorenson's one Saturday. The other dollar told about the dirty Parker basement Mary had set in order. Each quarter told of a show she had passed up, and the nickels and dimes were gum and candy Mary had denied herself. "There's three dollars and ninety-eight cents altogether." "I�ll take it all. Thanks, Sis." Bull had gathered up the money m a scoop and put it loose in his pocket. Despair had closed Mary's throat. She just couldn't make her vocal cords explain to Bill that that was her Christmas money, that he just couldn't have all of it! Mary had looked at the calendar. She had been crossing off the days until Christmas. There were just six left! That night, Mary couldn't face Granny the way she felt. Automatically she had brushed her teeth, jerked open the window, and crept shivering between the sheets. "Our Father...." Hours later she had awakened shaking, had sat up in bed and felt the chill of December through her flannel pajamas. She had shaken her brown curls. No? it hadn't been a dream. Bill really had borrowed her Christmas money...! Each afternoon after that, Mary had walked downtown after school to make certain the shawl for Granny hadn't been sold. Once she had almost asked the clerk to put the shawl away for her, but had decided there wasn't any use. She wouldn't be able to earn two dollars before Christmas. OW it was Christmas Eve. Bill had never mentioned the money. Mary wished for the thousandth time that she had told Bill it was Christmas money and had just not let him have it! She found herself almost wishing Bill hadn't even come home for Christmas, just stayed at the school. She could have sent him a present then. Now, who would give Granny a present? Mary knew Bill didn't have anything, because he always showed her his present for Granny. Poor old Granny? she dotes on Christmas so much, thought Marv. If her stocking were empty on Christmas morning... Mary couldn't bear the thought. She hid behind the curtain so Granny wouldn't see, as she dried her moist eyes. Tiny snowflakes, like down feathers, fluttered to the ground, each flake intent on building a fresh white path for Santa's-sleigh before the eventide. Suddenly, Mary noticed Reah and Carma coming up the walk. They were each carrying gifts wrapped in tissue. Mary turned from the window quickly. "Granny, Carma and Reah are coming. Please tell them I'm not home. Please, Granny." Mary started to run up the stairs. "Wait, child. You wouldn't make your old Granny tell a lie would you?" "All night, Granny, but I wish I really wasn't home. I... I wish I were dead!" "There, there, child. Go to the door, and greet your friends with a cheery Christmas wish." Then she thought: When these girls are gone I�ll have a talk with Mary. She's evaded me long enough. That child's in some sort of trouble, and I mean to get to the bottom of it. Mary opened the door as the girls knocked. "Hello, Granny Crockett, and Mary," Carma bubbled, "we brought over a little gift to put under your tree." "Why! Why, we haven't decorated our tree yet," Mary stammered. "Well, we'll just put them here on the table then, for now," Reah smiled. The cutting cold had stung her ears to redness. "I... I haven't wrapped your presents yet, kids. We're late this year." 836 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE DECEMBER 1946 PRELUDE To CHRISTMAS Mary wore an expression of bewilderment. "Mary, the whole gang is going caroling tonight. They're going to meet at my place about nine o'clock. Please come, your alto is so good," Carma invited. "I'm afraid I can't g0. You see... Granny isn't feeling well." Mary stopped short. Granny had said never to lie, and she seemed to be telling one right after another. Mary felt ill at ease and sighed with relief when her friends finally left. MARY turned to Granny. She could see that she would have to make an explanation of some kind for her actions, She would tell just one more lie. Granny must never know about Bill's having taken the money. Just then the back door opened. It was Bill, for he always entered like a gust of wind. He had Sue Rankin with him. "Hello, Mary and Gran. 'm home." Bill favored them with a grade "A" grin. "Say, Granny, I want to let you in on a secret. Sue's promised to wait for me 'till I get my shingle up. And she even wants to Wear my frat pin 'stead of a sparkler, Imagine that! I brought her over to help decorate this tree. It's the Prettiest one in town." Bill displayed a well-shaped evergreen, its branches shimmering with fresh snowflakes beneath the kitchen light. "Why, hello, Sue," Granny welcomed Bill's friend warmly, Bill pulled out his purse. It was bulging. He started to thing, but Granny, with a wide-eyed on earth did you get that 837 money this time of year, young man?" Granny spoke firmly. It was her job to check up on such things, and she intended to do it even in front of Sue, if necessary, "Why, Granny, I've worked all week at Tyler's, delivering orders," Bill stated proudly. Then, turning to Mary, "Here's five dollars, Mary. A dollar and two cents interest. I'd have paid you back sooner, but they just this minute paid me off." "But Bill... Five dollars!" started to protest. "That's okay, Sis. Banks charge more interest when they don't require security." A hard, painful little kernel in the center of Mary's being seemed to be melting out of existence. At sight of her, Bill's heart was swelled to bursting. He caught Mary in his arms and held her hard. "J thought you knew I'd pay in time for Christmas. Look at the clock. There are still two more hours before the stores close," Maty's face was shining as she looked up. "Granny, may I go down town?" Then in a whisper for Granny's ears alone, "I'm going to buy some mistletoe for Sue and Bill." She hurried for her wraps. "Granny, I think I'll go caroling with the gang before I come home." Granny left Sue and Bill to decorate the tree, Mary manger that first Christmas, many, Many years ago, the making and buying of presents was the prelude to Christmas, Faith Is a Heritage Christie Lund Coles CHAPTER 9 Synopsis: Kid Drage, young, attractive widow of 'Tom Drage, is teaching in the small town where she and her daughter Sharon live in Miss Nobbit's small apartment. Sharon complains of their lack of a home and Enid considers marrying the town banker who has tried to court her. Miss Nobbit dies suddenly and leaves her property to Enid. HOUGH it had been hard, at first, to handle the other woman's things and to live in her house, as the days and weeks passed, Enid found herself singing while she polished windows, furniture, silver, as she added a touch here and there to take the formal coldness from the house and make it more livable. Sharon helped her, touching the things with a little awe, saying, "I wonder where she got this ornate vase?" or, "How long do you suppose she has had these darling cups and saucers?" One day Sharon looked up with lovely, surprised eyes as her mother asked, "Do you know why we are cleaning everything so well?" "Yes. So it will seem more like our Own." "Well, not exactly. I'm going to have a party for you. What kind would you like?" Sharon paused a moment, looked about the large dining room and at the pretty dishes in the china cupboard. "I'd like a dinner party. I've always wanted one. Can we ask some boys, too?" "Don't you think you're a little young?"' Page 838 "Don't say that," Sharon begged, "sixteen is not young any more." "But you're not quite sixteen yet." "Soon will be." "Yes. But you're entitled to be fifteen until your birthday." "T don't want to wait that long." They both laughed, and Enid, graciously, conceded, "All right. There will be boys. Which ones... And what shall we eat?" "The eating will be your department. Which boys... Well, Ray Millersberg for one... Donald Web- @... "You rather like Ray, don't you?" Enid had been wanting to ask that for the past year, ever since she had noticed that he occasionally carried her books home and loitered by the gate. He was a nice boy; he had good, upright parents. She had never broached the subject before, because, somehow, she wanted to put off the day, as long as possible, when Sharon would be going out, would be interested in boys. Yet, she wanted that part of life for her daughter, just as she wanted every normal, good experience for her, every happy, wonderful phase of living. And the unhappy moments, too, if they would make her a better woman, a more understanding and unselfish wife. Sharon had taken her time to answer. Now she said, simply, "Yes. I like Ray. He's simply swell." "Come now, isn't there a better word for it than that? You wouldn't FAITH IS A HERITAGE suppose your mother had ever taught school." "I shouldn't want anyone to suppose it, if it meant I had to talk different from the rest of the crowd." Enid sighed. She hated to preach, though sometimes she wondered about this "crowd" thing. Young people seemed almost to have been turned out in a mold one after another, the same words, the same clothes, the same possessions. She supposed it had been so when she was in school, though it seemed much more evident now with all the "jive" talk, the sloppy joe sweaters, and the saddle oxfords that were imperative to a girl's enjoyment of school. She began carefully, "Why do you suppose it is, honey, that you have to be so much like the crowd?" Sharon answered it simply and quickly. And quite. Satisfactorily, "Why, it's important because then we feel that we belong, that we're not a fifth wheel on the social station wagon." Enid laughed again, using a popular slang term herself as she told her daughter, "You're sharp. And undoubtedly right. It would be too bad if we felt ourselves too let out of the parade. Even so, remember that really fine people have the courage of their convictions, they dare to be different, to grow slowly and surely..." "I know, Mom," Sharon answered. "Now, why don't you rest a few moments and figure out a super menu?" The menu was good, and the dinner a fine success. All the young people seemed to have an amazing amount of fun. She had fun being with them, watching them. When 839 it was time for them to leave, Sharon asked her mother, quietly, "Mom, Ray wants to know if I can go over to Springdale to their prom next week, he wants to know tonight." There had to be a first time, sooner or later. Enid knew her daughter would be sixteen in two weeks. She felt she had done pretty well to keep Sharon home at nights this long, when she saw the twelve and thirteen-year-old girls in their high heels and make-up, going out at nights when they should still be in bed getting long hours of sleep. She gave her consent. Later, she saw the smile on the boy's face as Sharon told him.... She remembered Tom's smile with a sudden, shaking vividness. Quietly, she went to bed. HE night Sharon went to the dance, Enid walked from one empty room to another. The house seemed unearthly quiet, except for the ticking of the grandfather's clock which stood in one corner of the living room. It seemed to be ticking the moments off grudgingly. It seemed to say, "You'll have to get used to this. She'll be gone many nights; you'll be alone. Someday, she'll marry... Then... You... Will... Be... Alone." She tried to read, to embroider, listened to the radio. Yet, in the end, she settled down in a large chair to dream of the past and just wait.. The past seemed so close. Perhaps that was why it was hard to feel she was being an adequate mother... She seemed so young herself. Perhaps people never really felt old within themselves, never thought of themselves as changing much with the passing of time. That seemed proof of the spirit's immortality. She stirred quickly as the clock struck twelve. Sharon had promised to be home at midnight. She wanted her to come, wanted to see her, touch her, help her out of her pretty dress into the clean, soft bed. She would give her some warm milk so she would be certain to relax and sleep, for well she remembered her first dance and how she had re-lived every moment for hours after. But there was no sudden opening of the door, no smiling, radiant girl coming in. The world was still. The clock ticked on. It was twelve-thirty, and when one o'clock came, her anger was replaced by apprehension. Something must have happened, something awful. She was tempted to call the marshal. Yet, she couldn't do that. If anything had happened she would have been notified; practically everyone knew Sharon, knew to whom she belonged. GHE walked out on the front porch, sat down on the railing looking toward the east, waiting. There was nothing to be seen. Then she saw the lights of a car, peering like a cat's eyes through the darkness as it came around the corner. She could hear it was making a strange noise, saw it slow down as it neared her house. She slipped, unseen, into the hall, saying to herself that she wouldn't be the kind of mother who embarrassed her daughter before her friends. She wouldn't make a scene. She wouldn't! Still, as Sharon came through the door, she couldn't help asking sharply, "Where have you been?" Sharon started to speak, then Enid noticed that Ray was with her. His clothes were dusty, there was a smear of grease on his cheek. He said quickly, "I'd like to explain to you, Mrs. Drage. I'm awfully sorry about keeping her out. We left the dance at eleven-thirty and thought we would have plenty of time. Then we had a flat. I didn't have a spare." Sharon spoke now, telling her, "We tried to hail a car and get a lift but we couldn't. Finally, the boys took the tire off and we came in on the nm." She looked so round-eyed and sweet, and the boy looked so frightened and earnest, that Enid wanted to laugh, wanted to tell them of a similar experience she had had when she was young, but she wasn't sure that would be wise, so instead she told them, "Well, let's try to see it doesn't happen again." Ray assured her, "It won't, Mrs. Drage. I promise you." He turned to leave, and she asked quietly, "Wouldn't you like to have a cup of warm milk and a cookie with Sharon?" He flushed, looked at Sharon, "Why, certainly. I'd like it very much." When they had finished their snack in the kitchen and he had left, Sharon, a little disheveled now, and sleepy, went into her mother's arms. "Tt was such fun," she told her, "even the tire. We laughed and laughed... That is, until I began worrying about you." After a moment, she added, wistfully, "My first dance." "The first of many," Enid assured her, "And now into bed with you." (To be concluded ) 840 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?DECEMBER 1946 The Place of Relief Society in the Welfare Plan (Continued from page 817) When he became thirsty from that terrible agony, he asked for a drink and they dipped the sponge in vinegar and thrust it to his lips. They mocked him, they spit upon him, they taunted him. Can you imagine more human suffering than the Master suffered, but he was not thinking of himself in those last hours, for down near the foot of the cross there huddled a little figure, her shawl pulled tightly about her face. Few friends had gathered around, and only one of the disciples, apparently. The Master had been looking down upon that little woman, and I fancy he had reached into her very soul with understanding. If her Son, this one upon the cross, should pass, who was going to care for her; who was going to take care of her and shepherd her against the pitfalls of one as lonely as she would then feel? The Master apparently thought about that, for he said, in one of the closing thoughts of his life: "Woman," as he nodded to her, "behold thy son," meaning John who stood near; and to John he said: "John, behold thy mother." And John knew what he meant, and straightway after the death of Jesus took the mother into his home and cared for her tenderly. If you would give true sympathy, then, let yours be the understanding that looks through the eyes of the sufferers and tries to see their problem from their standpoint. That is the only genuine sympathy that I know, and the only kind that should characterize the work of the Relief Society. I was up at the L. D. S. Hospital some years ago. One of my dearest friends, a man who had grown old in the service, and a grand old patriarch, was lying there with just a few hours to live. Most of the bodily processes that sustained life had ceased to function. His wife was lying down in the southeast part of the city, paralyzed and helpless. Oh, how he would have liked in that moment to have seen his dear companion, but he knew that was impossible because he had had to lift her about, she could not walk, and every move would bring pain to her wracked body. But this little woman down there in her home thought differently. She, too, had that desire, and so she had her children put her in a wheel chair. They put the wheel chair in the back of a truck and they came up to the L. D. S. Hospital and wheeled her up just outside the door where the father was dying. The daughter slipped in and said: "Daddy, would you like to see Mother "Oh, I should say I would, but I know that is not possible. Give her my love." "But, if we should bring Mother to you, would it shock you too much?" He said: "No, I don't think so." "Well, now don't let it surprise you too much, but Mother is outside the door. We will bring her in in a few moments." And so the Mother came in. I stood watching that sacred scene. Keep in mind that he was so near death that he could not move to embrace her, and she, in her paralyzed condition, could not bend over to Page 841 embrace him, nor to caress him. She just sat there and patted his hand as he reached it out toward her, and this is what she said to him: "Daddy, you and I have met a lot of problems in our life, haven't we? We know what it is to go through poverty, don't we, Daddy? We know what it is to go through sickness together, don't we? We know what it is to go through sorrow, don't we; Daddy?" And he said: "Yes, we do." "Well, now, Daddy, we know how to go through this, too, don't we?" He said: "Yes, dear." And she turned to her children and said: "That is all, I am ready to go." Ah, the understanding of that lovely wife. She gave him the kind of comfort that helped him through the portals of death with a peace that only one with such understanding could have given. Do you not see now, you sisters, why it is a great Program that the Lord has established. Which does not put the delicate work of contacting those in distress in the hands of a merely paid professional. Cannot you see why a mother who has reared her family, who has gone through these experiences, who lives neighbors to that mother, cannot you see why the Lord has put it upon the mothers of the Relief Society to visit these homes? Because, next to the Master himself, there are none in his Church who have a more lovely touch, a more complete understanding of the hearts and the lives of these individuals who are so precious in his sight. May the Lord bless you, my dear sisters, to carry on the great work that you have carried on through these years. You are loved as angels of mercy, as true angels of mercy. God give you the strength, the insight, and the determination, and the loyalty. Never let there be spoken in your hearing, without defense, criticism against the bishop, or against the Welfare Program, or against the Authorities of this Church. If there should come some from these whom you are trying to persuade kindly to co-operate with the bishop, in co-operating with the Welfare Program, where a Program has been developed for ten years to make for the security and peace of our people, when you find them in the homes, do not let yours ever be the voice that joins with them in criticism and saying, "Well, there must be some politics in this, or something else." You always say to them, if you are true to your responsibility as the sisters of the Relief Society: "My brother, my sister, if it were not for the fact that the Presidency of this Church knew that the Welfare Program was God inspired, and was for the blessing and benefit of the children of our Heavenly Father, who are members of this Church, we know that never would it have been given to us." If you will take that attitude, I want to tell you that power and strength will come to you, and influence for good that cannot be wielded by any other organization on the face of this earth. God bless you to measure up to your high responsibility and do the things that our Father has assigned to the Relief Society in this Welfare Program, I pray humbly, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, Amen. 842 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?DECEMBER 1946 (Continued from page 808) do with you if you are guilty of this farreaching offense? What will become of your children? Do you think the Lord will countenance your evil in which so many are made to suffer? Do you think that you can make another covenant when you have not been justified in the breaking of a former covenant, which brought misery to the children God entrusted to your care? Do not be deceived. The Father will not be mocked, nor will he permit us to trample his holy ordinance under our feet at will simply because of some trifling dissatisfaction. There will have to be many adjustments and our plans, if they are not in harmony with the law the Lord has given, will not stand in and after the resurrection. Some of us may find that we have deprived ourselves of these eternal blessings because of our petty and evil actions. Let us beware how we hold the covenants of the Lord, lest we be judged, and. being found guilty, lose the whole. The Lord bless you, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. DRESSING A DOLL Maude Blixt Trone How very gay 4 little dress can be! I think that I shall bind the neck with blue, And sew some little buttons on it, too, And make a pinafore of dimity. She'd better have a little coat of fur, For Jane will want to go to church with her. And she must have a lovely party dress With lace frills and ribbons, and, I guess, Flowers for her hair. Oh, I must hurry For children's years, like little rabbits, scurry Away so fast, just barely leaving Time enough for happiness or grieving Over the dolls that come and go away. Hurry! Janie has so little time to play. PRECIOUS SEASONS Thelma Ireland Spring makes me think of iron, Plowed earth so rich and brown, While summer is more golden, Grain fields like yellow down. And Autumn is like copper, That Jack Frost changed one night, But Winter is like platinum, So brittle, hard, and white. Fach season has its metal, Fach valuable and dear, So we should value every day And every precious year. LESSON DEPARTMENT Theology Church History Lesson 22 The Welfare Plan Initiated Elder H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, March 4, 1947 Objective: To show how the Lord is helping his saints to face the problems of our day. INNER spiritual strength comes often through suffering. To be called upon to share enriches the soul. The Lord would have his people experience the joys of the greater love known through service to others. From the very beginning, the restored Church of our day has been forced through persecution and hardship into the close bonds of brotherhood. From the early days of the Church in New York, across the rolling hills of Ohio, on to the level prairies of the Mississippi, and thence to the mountains of the great West, the saints have been forced to share alike in joys and sorrows. Poor in material goods and the promise of great worldly wealth, the pioneers of Utah learned to seek the inner joys of the spirit which God gives to his people. No man can understand these promptings of the heart who has not first complied with the gospel principles. Only these signs shall follow them that believe and enter in at the straight and narrow gate. Quietly, but effectively forward have moved the Lord's people, until today they number their strength by the thousands. Their roots are deep. Winds of Page 844 adversity have only anchored them more firmly, and now, amid the storms that rage at home and abroad, may be seen the wisdom of God in keeping his people one. The world will never fully understand the Church Welfare Plan, which had its beginning in August of 1933, with public announcement by the First Presidency at April conference 1936, until it can more fully accept the Lord's way of caring for those in need: Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world (James 1:27). It is the spiritual value of this present plan that is at the basis of its operation. The passage, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself," remembered most as a New Testament quotation, is God's will as recorded first in the Old Testament (Lev. 19:18). Men must learn these unchanging truths if they would honestly care for their less fortunate brothers. In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the enduring values of the Lord's will have ever been taught. Saints humbly trust in his unfailing promises and strive to receive his word. LESSON DEPARTMENT To them, the heavens are not closed. God still speaks through his properly ordained servants today as of old. 'These facts must be kept in mind if one would truly understand the genius of the present Welfare Plan of the Church. Based, then, upon the will of the Lord, the Latter-day Saints take literally his express will as follows: first, they believe that it is more blessed to give than to receive (Acts 20:35); and second, they have learned his command to labor. From Sinai came the words, "Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work... Thou shalt not steal... Thou shalt not covet..." Ex. 20::9, 15,17). Said President J. Reuben Clark, Jr.: Thus the Divine commands to the Church and the directions of its leaders to the people, require as a fundamental principle of their religion that Church members not in distress shall care for the needy widow and orphan, and for the poor, and that these latter shall not lay their hands on other men's goods, they shall not be greedy or covetous, they shall not be idlers, and the physically fit shall work for what they get. No exception has been made to these commands, and no person has been taken out from under them. The Church vigorously decries idleness. Industry, economy, and thrift are extolled. Deceit, avarice, dishonesty, lying, greed, graft are condemned. Honesty, truthfulness, sobriety, willingness to give, love for fellowmen, sympathy for woe, misery, and want, service to and for others, are urged to the point of command. These are the reasons for setting up the Church Welfare Plan; they are the principles underlying it. We claim no monopoly on the virtues which have made our achievements possible. These virtues have been the common heritage of every pioneer out-thrusting in America. Save perhaps in degree, our experience 845 has been the experience of all the pioneers of Western America. None were subsidized, none had easy money, none either asked for or received, government gratuities. Had they waited for these, indeed had they got them, America would never have been built. Some justify our present economic course by saying, 'times have changed." So they have, but character-building has not. The laws of righteousness and progress are eternal. 'There is no escape from them, either for the individual or for the nation. An uncorrupted citizenry builds a great State; no State ever built an uncorrupted citizenry. No man is politically free who depends upon the State for his sustenance. A planned and subsidized economy beats down initiative, wipes out industry, destroys character, and prostitutes the electorate. I repeat In view of all these considerations, the Church has felt that in setting up its Welfare Plan, it was not only meeting its prescribed duty as a Church to its members, but was performing a duty of patriotism to our country ("Church Welfare Program, A Discussion," by President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., Estes Park, Colorado, June 20, 1939, pp. 5, 6, 7, 8). Over thirteen years have passed since the present Welfare Plan of the Church had its beginning. It was started in 1933, with public announcement by the First Presidency at the general conference, April 1936. 'The worst depression ever to grip the world then threatened to engulf thousands. Sensing the effect this suffering would have, not only upon the physical well-being of the saints, but also what the enslavement of temporary jobs and the dole would bring, the General Authorities of the Church sought the Lord's will as it had been given and envisioned a timely plan that would be "a very present help in trouble" (Psalms 46:1). It seemed then to many who were called to lay in a year's supply of food and clothing that there might be undue alarm for giving such instructions. Quietly, however, the organization of the Priesthood in the wards and stakes was marshalled. The bishop, as father of the ward, called his counselors and clerk and began a closer check up of suffering and unemployed among his families. The ward teachers brought in upon new card forms, information which would help to keep in constant touch with each ward member. Relief Society sisters stimulated again the pioneer virtues of their grandparents, preserved foodstuffs, prepared clothing, and established sewing and cooking centers where larger groups could learn and encourage one another in the arts of industry and thrift. Household budgets were studied and prepared, the fainthearted were given encouragement, despair and distress were turned to hope and faith. From the small towns to the crowded cities, saints, often slow at first to comprehend, finally respond. Ed to the call of the Church. A new security developed. There was strength in unity, and problems which seemed hard in the dark days of want grew less, as members accepted the role of being their brothers' keepers. Today, the objectives of the Church Welfare Plan, as outlined in the L. D. S. Church: Welfare Handbook of Instructions, indicate the wisdom and inspiration which brought this much-needed help to the Church. Truly a people cannot perish with such divine vision: OBJECTIVES: The Church Welfare Plan is a program designed to relieve distress among Church members who may be in need; to strengthen the economic condition of all who participate by utilizing surpluses of time, talents, effort and substance, and to promote the general welfare of the Church members at large. Its detailed objectives include the following: 1. That no member of the Church shall want for sustenance. 2. That needed assistance be rendered in times of sickness, accident, death, or other distress to all for whom the Church is responsible. 3. That whenever and wherever worthy employable members are unable to find gainful employment sufficient for their needs, they shall be provided an opportunity to work on a welfare project. 4. That any person who receives welfare assistance, unless unemployable, shall work in the Program. 5- That benefits received for such work be mainly in terms of welfare produced food and commodities, supplemented by other supplies and cash if necessary, the total amount of which shall be based on the needs of the family unit rather than on a fixed compensation per unit of time. There may be some exceptions to this general rule where specific amounts of cash and commodities are given for service rendered. But even in these cases, where such fixed earnings are not sufficient for the needs of the family they may be supplemented by additional commodities from a bishops' storehouse. 6. That the terms "dole" and "charity," as generally understood, have no place in this program. Worthy members who, through age or other disability, are incapable of working in the Program, and who have no other logical means of support, shall be sustained by their respective Church communities from the resources of the Welfare Plan, not as charity but in recognition of their faithful support and services to the Church. 7. That families that are closely associated as neighbors, or through quorum, ward or other Church organizational activities, be encouraged to form small productive groups for co-operatively helping each other to plant and harvest crops, can, process and store foods, or carry out other projects for their mutual advantage and well-being. 846 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE DECEMBER 1946 LESSON DEPARTMENT Such activities are to be carried on separate and apart from the bishops' storehouse program in many localities. Welfare central, equipment and supplies are made available to those carrying out of such projects.
SCOPE: The Welfare Plan is Church wide, reaching to every Latter-day Saint ward and branch in the stakes of the Church. In the missions, welfare work is limited to an effort to solve local problems.
PARTICIPANTS may potentially comprise all members of the Church. Those who are in need of sustenance, relief of distress, or rehabilitation may participate on the receiving end, at the same time being expected to contribute their own time, talents and substance toward their own support. Others are urged to participate on the giving end�to give part of their energy, produce or finances to the general pool for the common good. All members have an opportunity to join with their neighbors and associates in carrying on worthwhile projects for their mutual benefit and blessing.
WORKERS may be classified as:
1. Those who, regardless of circumstances, are provided employment on a welfare project and in return have their needs supplied from the bishops' storehouses.
2. Those who donate part of their time and energy towards the production of food and other commodities for the benefit of the program as a whole, but who themselves receive no direct benefit or compensation for such services.
3. Those who are employed on a part or full time basis to be supervisors or key workers.
4. Those who are called to direct the program, whether in general capacities, regional, stake or ward.
FUNCTIONS: In order to reach the objectives of the Welfare Plan with any degree of completeness, there must be a clear conception of the necessary functions of the Welfare organization.
These basic functions are:
1. To determine the needs of the people.
2. To gather needed control commodities and commodity contributions.
3. To render needed assistance and to provide employment through work projects.
4. To manage the storage and distribution of commodities.
5. To meet the physical needs of ward members requiring assistance.
6. To promote Welfare work in Melchizedek and Aaronic Priesthood units.
7. To guide agricultural and other rehabilitation.
8. To provide hospitalization for Church cases. (L. D. S. Church Welfare Handbook of Instructions, pp. 7-10.)
Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion
With the help of the suggested readings given below, have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part of the Doctrine and Covenants to discover wherein we must "give heed unto his word," which has been written for our life in this day.
There are but a few active Church members today who have not, in part at least, learned the workings of the Church Welfare plan either through adolescent lessons, Melchizedek Priesthood quorum instruction on Latter-day Saint Church Welfare, or have had complete or outlining the operation of this plan. A copy of this pamphlet should be at hand during the class discussion of this lesson. For the best discussion of the period let us center upon the spiritual outcomes of this plan as these may be discussed from the questions and readings that follow.
1. Who may fall under the condemnation of the Lord given in the passage? Read Doc. and Cov. 56:16-20.
2. On April 23, 1832, in Independence, Missouri, the Prophet was given a revelation as he sat in council with his brethren. Read what the Lord said on that occasion. (Doc. and Cov. 83:1. What significance has this new interpretation to the old one of "love thy neighbor" as given in this revelation?
3. The Lord would have his people seek the welfare of eternity. This, he said, could not be done with eyes full of greediness. (Doc. and Cov. 68:25-32). Why not? What were his commands concerning the sharing of one's properties? (Read Doc. and Cov. 42:30-31; 104:11-18.)

Visiting Teachers' Messages Our Pioneer Heritage Lesson 6?Self-Reliance President Amy Brown Lyman For Tuesday, March 4, 1947 Objective: 'To show that the pioneers were resourceful, creative, and self-reliant. NE of the distinctive differences between the first settlers of Utah and other early settlers in Western America was that the Latter-day Saint colonizers came from a larger number of different localities than did those of any other group. There were among them representatives from practically every state in the Union, from Canada, and from several European countries. 'Then, too, among the Latter-day Saints there were farmers, tradesmen, factory workers, teachers, physicians, clerks, etc. This variation in background, training, and experience was a great advantage to these colonists as individuals as it was also to the communities as a whole. It resulted in greater vision, a broader viewpoint, and added to their efficiency in planning and in carrying out their plans successfully. It has often been said that necessity is the mother of invention. It might be added that necessity is also the mother of resourcefulness. And it is resourcefulness which enables people to manage well. It helps them to accomplish things. It begets self-reliance. In resourcefulness, creative ability, and_ self-reliance, the pioneers of Utah were masters of the highest order. With wisdom and foresight, Brigham Young had advised those who were planning to emigrate to Utah to bring with them choice seeds, good tools of every description, machinery not only for farming but also for spinning and weaving. All these things stood them in good stead in their efforts at community building. During the first year in Utah, there was great activity in plowing, planting, and in irrigating. The pioneers soon learned that in this desert land irrigation was a necessity. Gristmills and sawmills were soon built. A tannery for making leather for shoes and harnesses had to be constructed. Other industries were gradually established, and fortunately those were found who, because of past experience in mills, shops, factories, and mercantile establishments, were able to carry on the work required. Upon their arrival in the Valley. The pioneers lived in their wagons until they were able to cut and saw and haul logs from the canyons for the building of cabins. Later, for home building, they used adobe or bricks made of clay and dried in the sun. Cobblestones in clay and soft rocks were also used. Old-fashioned fireplaces were installed for heating and cooking. The fuel used was sage and oak brush. A few pieces 848 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE DECEMBER 1946 , LESSON DEPARTMENT of furniture were brought across the plains, but most of the furniture was made by the pioneers out of native wood. It consisted, in the main, of tables, cupboards, bureaus, beds, and chairs with willow seats. Dirt floors were the rule in the beginning. Later, floors made from logs flattened on one side, and not always too smooth, were used; and, finally, braided rugs and homemade carpets were added.
The attribute of self-reliance is inherent in the gospel of the Master. One should employ all his own inventiveness and exert himself to the utmost before expecting the Lord or anyone else to come to his aid. It would be well for members of the Church in this day to emulate the example of the pioneers in developing and strengthening, in themselves, the power to be found in self-reliance.

(A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting)
Lesson 6�Finishing, Trimming, Collars, Bands, Hems
Work Meeting Committee, Velma N. Simonsen, Chairman
For Tuesday March 11, 1947
Objective: To demonstrate the use of different trimmings, and the adjusting of necklines and hems.
Reference: The Complete Book of Sewing, Chapters 8, 9, 16, 21.
Trimmings
Very often a perfectly fitted and correctly lined garment is completely spoiled by its trimmings. Study line, balance, and proportion carefully for trimmings. The decorative items of a costume should never look as if they had been fastened on the garment, but they should be blended into its very lines. (See The Complete Book of Sewing, Chapter 21.)
Collars
Collar fashions change from one season to another, but the basic method never changes. The foundation is always the same, the dress neck.
The fit and shape of a dress neck govern the fit of the collar. A perfect neckline that hugs the base of the neck is most essential. A smart, comfortable collar can never be perfected on a weak foundation. Figure A illustrates how a dress neckline must fit to the base of the neck to make a proper fitting collar. Figure B illustrates a poor dress neckline which is cut too low at the back.
[Two illustrated profile drawings of women's heads showing correct (A) and incorrect (B) neckline fits]
850 To alter a poor dress neckline, recut the shoulders and the neck, if the blouse is long enough. If not, add a piece of material, as from 1-2 shown on Figure B. (See The Complete Book of Sewing, Chapter 16, pp. 110-115). Hems Know the purpose of hems. 'Too many sewers think the only purpose of a hem is to dispose of, or hide, the raw edge at the bottom of a dress. A hem is a finish for the lower edge, or on other parts of a garment. All types of Hems should be even, without the slightest variation. The method of sewing in place depends on the design of the garment and the type of fabric. Some hems serve only as a finish, while others are decorative as well. The average person pulls the stitches too tight and over RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE DECEMBER 1946 stitches when hemming. For the average weight material, stitches should be from 3/8 to 3/4 inches apart. The stitches should have sufficient ease to prevent an imprint of the stitch from showing on the right side of the garment. Never put a hem in silks, woolens, or fine muslin with a sewing machine. Hems in materials of these types should always be put in by hand. The usual depth of a hem for dresses and skirts is about 2 inches, unless the skirt is flared or circular, then the hem should be narrower. The fullness at the top of a circular hem, if it is made too deep, causes a bulky, heavy top, resulting in a pronounced hemline on the right side of the garment. Assignment for April: Bring the dress you have completed, ready for fasteners, and bring the type of fasteners desired. Literature America as Revealed in Its Literature Lesson 6 Carrying America Across a Continent Elder Howard R. Driggs For Tuesday, March 4, 1947 AT one time, the writer, visiting the historical museum at Portland, Oregon, was shown by its veteran custodian, George Himes, an intriguing exhibit. "This corner," said the pioneer, "has a relic from each state east of the Mississippi. Here, for example, is a clock that ticked time in Vermont; here a scythe that mowed blue grass in Kentucky; here a Franklin stove that warmed a home in Pennsylvania; and here a cradle in which a baby was rocked as its parents crossed the plains from Indiana." "That is most interesting," was the response. "Wouldn't it be fine, too, if we could show something else those pioneers carried into their great conquest of the West?" "What is that?" "Oh, I was just thinking of their high American ideals based on a spirit of true Christianity. They came to build homes, and with them schools, and churches. They came to found communities of the American pattern and spirit." "Yes, indeed, they did," agreed the pioneer, "and they even sprinkled our map with names of their old towns. Portland, for instance, is named for Portland, Maine. There are thirty-two Salems, I am told, in the United States; and I don't know how many Springfields, and Farmingtons." Here was truly a transplanting of our civilization across a continent. In the story of this great westward march of America, there is something of deeper significance than just the outward, the material aspects of pioneering. It was  
spiritual urge that, perhaps unknowingly with some individuals and groups, gave motive and  purpose to the mighty movement. Inspired by such a thought as this, Katherine Lee Bates wrote these lines in her ''America, the Beautiful": O Beautiful for pilgrim feet. Whose stern,  impassioned stress, A thoroughfare for freedom beat, Across the wilderness! America! America! God mend thine every flaw, Confirm thy soul in self-control. Thy liberty in law! One rather common, fallacious idea about the pioneers needs to be corrected. They were not, as too often portrayed in plays and pageants, just rough, uncultured, gray-haired folk. Far from it. Our westward march of America was in large part a youth movement; most of those who survived the rigors of that testing journey into the new homeland were in their early manhood and  womanhood; all were youthful in strength and spirit. Age records and achievements prove this. Further, there were many truly cultured souls and artists and real leaders among the builders of  our West. Hardships, at times, held back their finest expression, yet not altogether. Often, some poet�like our own Eliza R. Snow� would record precious thoughts in a journal, or voice inmost feelings in a lyric. Leaders, counselling the people, often rose to eloquence; and,  occasionally, as tory would be recorded portraying with artistry the life and character of the true western pioneers. A few lines from Oxteam Days, by Ezra Meeker, who, at twentytwo years of age, went with his wife and their babe along the old Oregon Trail into what is now the State of Washington, takes us into their humble home: In the cabins there was as wide variance in habits as there is in more pretentious homes today. Some of the women were careless and untidy about their housekeeping, while others believed "cleanliness is next to godliness." . . . Flower gardens soon appeared in every dooryard to enliven the homes, and spread contentment in the households. You must not think that we had no recreation and that we were a sorrowful set. There never was a happier lot of people than the hard-working pioneers and their families. We had joy and amusements as well as labor. My mind harks back to our happy home life in the little cabin in the forest � to the twilight concert of the bird songsters; to the dripping dews of the dense foliage of the trees; to the pleasant gatherings within the cabin; to the old-time music of the violin, flute, melodeon, mingled with the voices of many now hushed and hidden from us ... .No Christmas ever went by without a Christmas tree, at which the whole neighborhood joined. The Fourth of July was never passed without a celebration. We made presents for the tree if we could not buy them, and supplied the musicians, reader and orator for the celebration. Everybody had something to do, and that very fact made us all happy. In his little book of boyhood mem Overland in a Covered Wagon, Joaquin Miller, poet of the Sierras, brings to us with literary touch something of the same spirit with pictures of pioneer days. In the poem "When Little Sister Came," he says: We dwelt in the woods of the Tippecanoe, In a lone, lost cabin, with never a view Of the full day's sun for a whole year through. With strange half hints through the russet com We three were hurried one night. Next morn There was frost on the trees, and a sprinkle of snow And tracks on the ground. Through the door, And a girl baby cried and then we were four. We burst Just a touch here of the joy three pioneer lads had in welcoming a little sister to their group. The Miller home in old Indiana, and later in Oregon, was, though isolated, one of simple culture. The father was a teacher; the mother of gentle, refined spirit. Books they had good books and the joy of these was shared by the family. Later, one son caught the "gold fever' and drifted into California, where he became a poet. His love and appreciation of babes was later expressed in another of his poems, "Utah's Best Crop." In carrying America "from sea to shining sea," the pioneers exemplified their love for the simple, basic things of life. Home and children, friends and neighbors, devotion to the principles of Christianity were of first moment with the honest settlers of our great land. With these came a desire for learning and culture and true recreation. Finally, to assure these blessings, the government of the free American pattern was established in the communities and states that were developed out of the new domain. The late Senator William E. Borah pays this eloquent tribute to these nation builders who added new stars to our flag: Invading a wilderness, a region without order, a vast country without law, traveling strange paths, and adopting sometimes harsh and startling methods, nevertheless the ultimate aim was great commonwealths, a country dedicated to orderly and regulated liberty. The pioneer was not merely an adventurer seeking gold, he was an empire builder; he laid a broad and firm foundation for these great commonwealths. They are in the true sense the real monuments to the pioneer. Reference to the pioneer, however brief, would be both incomplete and unfair without special mention of the pioneer woman.... What a marvel of patience, of devotion, of indefinable charm and tenderness, even amid the roughest environments of the desert; and above all, what self-control and courage in the hour of imminent peril! Some gifted pen will sometime, I trust, pay a fitting tribute to this sublime exhibition of American womanhood. (From Introduction to Frontier Law.) At least one really artistic expression honoring the pioneer woman has come within recent years. This is from the pen of one of Utah's gifted poets, Ann Woodbury Hafen, by whose gracious permission we are privileged to present here: MY MOTHER'S HAND Today I looked upon a map of the West? my mother's hand. Flesh geography of the old frontier. In the strong blue veins that ridged the furrowed skin,. In the eddied knuckles, weathered nails, and gullied palm I saw the raw West shape a woman's hand As that hand shaped the West. A picture map deep-etched this hand that worked a hoe, 852 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?DECEMBER 1946 LESSON DEPARTMENT Scythed alfalfa bribes for evening milk, Carried adobes for the long-dreamed - house, Scrubbed out irrigation's mud and sweat. This steady hand that pressed the danger trigger Delivered newborn, needled shrouds, and washed the dead. Ninety beauty-hungry years, through four generations of weddings The sure hand moved, a self-willed dynamo creating Sixty stitches to a minute, twenty pieces to a quilt-block, Forty blocks to a quilt of rainbow wedding rings To warm the matings. In an Old World garden, velvet white, this hand Secreted seeds in a young bride's deepest pocket, Guarded them from hunger's blind devouring Through six thousand alien miles And fed them at last to the black volcanic ash Of the Rocky Mountains. Out of a woman's bended labor, Watered by a widow's tearful prayers, Stirred by courage of a mother's hand The sleeping land awoke to food and flowers. Flesh geography of the West I touched today. In the seamed erosions of a weathered palm I saw a nation's story carved in glory. Dynamic map of life, my mother's hand. Another poetic picture this of a pioneer father by the same artist, under the title, "Another Lincoln," printed in Mrs. Hafen's book of poems Quenched Fire, portrays the culture and beauty of life of our pioneers amid exacting hardships. Some of our authors are beginning to bring out, with artistic strokes, the inner spirit and true character of the stalwart, yet tender men and women who carried our civilization across a continent. Nowhere is all this home-building, 853 community-founding conquest of the West more plainly shown, than in the stirring story of our own pioneers. Unlike other home seekers, those true to the Latter-day Saint faith, went westward not "'on their own," nor in hastily formed, temporary groups, but as carefully organized caravans, trusting in leaders they believed to be inspired. As a result, their percentage of casualties on the dangerous trail across plains and mountains was comparatively much lower; and the colonization of the new homeland relatively of greater success. A clear, concrete picture of 'the great work of founding communities in the valleys of the mountains a region no one else wanted may be found in the book, Brigham Young, by Preston Nibley. It is an American epic of challenging interest, this story of the planting of towns throughout the arid region with practical and spiritual guidance, and with the principles of freedom exemplified in their government. Within the first decade after the arrival of the pioneer vanguard, these self-sustaining, self-governing communities had been established by our people not only over Utah, but in what is now Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada, and California. More to our present purpose, the spiritual and cultural side of life was splendidly remembered in this planting. Churches, temples, schools, and even theaters were built along with homes. Religion, education, recreation all went hand in hand with industry. Authors and artists and actors were encouraged in their creative work, yet all these varied activities, it was taught, were to be infused with the spirit of the gospel if the blessings of the Lord were to be upon them. Pictures of such a God-inspired homeland stirred one youthful-spirited poet in far-off England, Charles W. Penrose, to write these lyric lines: O ye mountains high, where the clear blue sky Arches over the vales of the free, Where the pure breezes blow and the clear streamlets flow, How I've longed to your bosom to flee! O Zion! Dear Zion! Land of the free, Now my own mountain home, unto thee I have come? All my fond hopes are centered in thee. In later years, another poet, contemplating the America that might have been visioned by those who laid its foundations on the principles of freedom, wrote: O beautiful for patriot dream That sees beyond the years; Thine alabaster cities gleam Undimmed by human tears! America! America! God shed his grace on thee, And crown thy good with brotherhood, From sea to shining seal Katherine Lee Bates All this brings us to a concluding thought which may be made clear and concrete with a simple analogy. In their westward march, the pioneers stretched the warp of true Americanism stout and taut and true "from sea to shining sea." Into that tested warp, through the years, has been woven the woof that makes the heroic, the colorful epic of our country. It is of vital concern to every American that the warp hold that it be kept stout and true? and also that there be in the woof beauty and artistry in harmony with the true spirit of America as the founding fathers and our pioneers dreamed it.

Edgar Lyon For Tuesday, March 18, 1947 LATTER day Saint theology differs greatly from all other Christian interpretations of the Godhead, because of its teaching concerning the personalities that constitute this trinity. In regard to the Holy Ghost, our teaching is different and more positive than others. Most confessing Christians believe that the Holy Ghost is nothing more than a spirit that is part of the Eternal God, radiating from him in much the same way that light and heat are radiated from a central source of supply. Latter-day revelation has given us the true conception. Verses twenty-two and twenty-three of section 130 in the Doctrine and Covenants instruct us as follows: The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us. A man may receive the Holy Ghost, and it may descend upon him and not tarry with him. This scripture teaches specifically that the Holy Ghost is a personage separate from either the Father or the Son, being without a tangible body, yet possessed of individuality and personality, and having the ability to dwell within a mortal soul. However, this indwelling may be either temporary or permanent, according to the worthiness of the person, the needs of the person, or the manner in which it was _bestowed upon him. If bestowed according to the prescribed rules of the Church, the person receives the gift of the Holy Ghost, which should be a lasting, vital part of his life and his faith, The Prophet Joseph Smith explained this in a statement that has become a classic description of the difference between the gift of the Holy Ghost that one receives at confirmation, and the temporary descent that the Holy Ghost may make on special occasions. There is a difference between the Holy Ghost and the gift of the Holy Ghost. Cornelius received the Holy Ghost before he was baptized, which was the convincing power of God unto him of the truth of the Gospel, but he could not receive the gift of the Holy Ghost until after he was baptized. Had he not taken this sign or ordinance upon him, the Holy Ghost which convinced him of the truth of God, would have left him. Until he obeyed these ordinances and received the gift of the Holy Ghost, by the laying on of hands, according to the order of God, he could not have healed the sick or commanded an evil spirit to come out of a man, and it obey him; for the spirits might say unto him, as they did to the sons of Sceva: "Paul we know and Jesus we know, but 856 who are ye?" (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, page 199). It is necessary to distinguish between the Holy Ghost and the divine spirit that is to be found everywhere on earth among mortals of all races, creeds, and colors. President Joseph F. Smith very pointedly explained this difference: It is not the Holy Ghost who in person lighteth every man who is born into the world, but it is the light of Christ, the Spirit of Truth, which proceeds from the source of intelligence, which permeates all nature, which lighteth every man and fills the immensity of space. You may call it the Spirit of God, you may call it the influence of God's intelligence, you may call it the substance of his power, no matter what it is called, it is the spirit of intelligence that permeates the universe and gives to the spirits of men understanding (Gospel Doctrine, pp. 73-74). What then, is the function of the Holy Ghost that is conferred upon us as a gift at the time of confirmation? It gives to those receiving the gift, if they are faithful, the right to the companionship of the Holy Ghost. It is also the completion of the symbolic representation of a rebirth that is part of the acceptance of the gospel of Jesus Christ. When John the Baptist appeared in the towns and villages of Judea, he preached a powerful message of repentance, calling upon the people to straighten out their crooked ways of living and bring forth the fruits of righteous living. Then, when this had been done, he urged them to accept baptism by immersion that symbolized the washing away of sins and the burial of the old, sinful self. John did not end his work with the accomplishment of the ordinance of baptism. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?DECEMBER 1946He stressed the fact that there must still be a rebirth by the Spirit, to complete the act of regeneration to a new life. He said:. I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you whom ye know not; He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.... The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me. And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.... I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him. And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost (John 1:26-33). The elderly gentleman referred to in lesson five who did not count the first forty-five years of his life, had fully caught the significance of this idea that John was preaching. Jesus told Nicodemus that unless a person were born again "of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" (John 3:5). This idea of the rebirth to a newness of life through water baptism and the reception of the Holy Ghost became the fundamental message of the Christian Church in its public preaching. After having completed a "Bath of Regeneration," as some have called baptism, our elderly friend had had hands laid upon him. The conferring of the Holy Ghost upon him had, in his estimation, completed his rebirth as much as the entrance of his spirit into his body at physical birth had given him mortal existence. Jesus spoke of the Holy Ghost as LESSON DEPARTMENT a "Comforter." On_ several occasions he informed his apostles that, following his departure from them, they should be comforted in his absence by the Spirit that would be sent them from the presence of the Father. As the years passed and these apostles went into the world to proclaim the good tidings of the gospel, they were literally comforted by the Holy Ghost. It gave to them the comforting testimony of the reality of the cause for which they were forced to suffer and endure opposition and hardships (see Acts 2:1-4; I Cor. 2:9-16). Another function of the Holy Ghost is to lead those who receive it in paths of truth. If one lives in accordance with gospel teachings, loves his neighbor, and serves God, the guarantee is given that the Holy Ghost will be a constant companion. If this companionship is enjoyed, truth will always be discernible, and error will have no power over the mind. Evil, which is the embodiment of error, will be shunned, and good will be chosen in its place. The Savior promised his apostles that the Comforter should act as their inspirer, giving to them words to speak as occasion arose, recalling to their memory needful experiences and ideals (John 14:26). He promised it would make them equal to every occasion that might arise. Furthermore, he promised them that it would serve as the spirit of revelation, that they might speak revealed truths and give utterance to prophetic teachings. There remains yet another function of the Holy Ghost. It has the power of aiding in the acquisition of the spiritual gifts of God. We cannot all be apostles or prophets or 857 stake presidents or bishops or hold other offices of trust. But each Latter-day Saint can diligently seek to gain the promised spiritual gifts. Various passages of scripture describe them as the virtues of patience, forgiveness, humility, longsuffering, kindness, meekness, control of the tongue, pure thoughts, courage in the face of trial or disappointment, faith in the gospel and the atonement, chastity, service to fellow men and unselfishness. Without the acquisition of these qualities, the Christian character is deficient. The ordinance by which the Holy Ghost is conferred upon the individual is commonly known as "the laying on of hands," although this procedure is also used for ordinations to the Priesthood, for patriarchal blessings, and when one is set apart for a specific office or calling within the Church. Accompanying the laying on of hands by those authorized to confer the Holy Ghost, the following words are spoken: "In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ receive ye the Holy Ghost." Only those bearing the Melchizedek Priesthood have authority to officiate in the laying on of hands. Scriptural evidence is available, indicating that only such authorized bestowal has been recognized. In Acts 19:1-6, there is an account that is illustrative of this necessary power. Arriving at Ephesus on his missionary travels, the Apostle Paul found a group of about twelve professing Christians, who had ?????undergone some type of baptism. Paul inquired if the Holy Ghost had been conferred upon them, to which they replied that they had never heard that there was such a thing. Paul instructed them more fully, came to the conclusion that their baptism had apparently been performed by someone who was not divinely authorized, and rebaptized them. Then he laid his hands upon them and conferred the Holy Ghost upon them, with miraculous results. The eighth chapter of Acts likewise contains evidence of the practice of the laying on of hands. A sorcerer or magician, having observed Peter and John confer the Holy Ghost through the laying on of hands, offered the apostles a sum of money if they would grant him the gift to lay on hands for the bestowal of the divine power (see Acts 8:9-24). Discussion and Activity Problems 1. Name as many functions as you can that are ascribed to the Holy Ghost. 2. In what sense was the Holy Ghost that fell upon Cornelius and his associates (see Acts 10:34-48) different from the Holy Ghost that was given to you following your baptism? 3. What is the value of the Holy Ghost in our religious thinking and daily living? 4. Have a class member either read or relate the material found in the second chapter of Moroni, concerning the bestowal of the Holy Ghost by the Nephite twelve. 5. In preparation for the discussion period, stress the part that the Holy Ghost should play in the development of Christian conduct. References Smith, Pres.

Social Science The Family in the Gospel Plan Lesson 5?Importance of Religious Instruction in the Home Social Science Committee, Leone O. Jacobs, Chairman For Tuesday, March 25, 1947 RELIGION should be a part of every life. "Man does not live by bread alone." 'There are other hungers and other needs than the purely physical. Religion is as necessary to the soul as food and drink to the body. An authority on child welfare has said: What causes young people to commit crimes is the poverty of the spirit, a spiritual starvation, and we who, as a people, reared children on that stinted ration must acknowledge the error and make haste to amend it in home and school and society. Human beings are complex creatures, and the wisest of men know little about their inner selves. But of one thing, the dullest among us are certain. Man is a creature of spirit and body. One part cannot thrive without the support of the other. If either is ignored, both suffer. In the last quarter century the 858 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE DECEMBER 1946 LESSON DEPARTMENT spiritual growth of children has been rather neglected. We should set about remedying the matter without quibbling. President Grant has said: I have heard men and women say that they were going to let their sons and daughters grow to maturity before they sought to teach them the principles of the gospel, that they were not going to cram the gospel down them in their childhood, before they were able to comprehend it.... The Lord has said it is our duty to teach our children in their youth.... It is folly to imagine that our children will grow up with a knowledge of the gospel without teaching (Gospel Standards, page 155). Parents would not think of saying, "I will not teach my child obedience, honesty or virtue, but will wait until he is grown and let him then choose for himself whether or not he wishes to live such principles." It is just as unwise to let a child grow up bereft of religious education and expect him to acquire it later. By the time a child is grown, his character is already formed. When he is mature it is usually too late to introduce to him a new phase of life. Most likely a child who has grown up with no religious background will never choose a religion by himself. His life having developed thus far without spiritual training, he may never see a need for it later. Importance of Parental Example As in the training of children along other lines, the example set in religious training by the parents is of prime importance. It is unusual for a child to seek religion if his parents have not shown interest or activity in this regard. President Joseph F. Smith said: 859 It does not need argument to convince our minds that our children will be just about what we make them. They are born without knowledge or understanding? the most helpless creatures of the animal creation born into the world.. And the child will be largely what its environment and its parents and teachers make it (Gospel Doctrine, page 367). The Responsibility of Parents As Latter-day Saint parents, we are charged with a sacred responsibility to teach our children the gospel. From the Doctrine and Covenants 68:25, 28, we read: And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents.... And they shall also teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord. As President Joseph F'. Smith said: One of the most important duties devolving upon the Latter-day Saints is the proper training and rearing of their children in the faith of the gospel. The gospel is the greatest thing in all the world. There is nothing to compare with it. The possessions of this earth are of no consequence when compared with the blessings of the gospel. Naked we came into the world, and naked we will go out of the world, so far as earthly things are concerned; for we must leave them behind; but the eternal possessions which are ours through obedience to the gospel of Jesus Christ do not perish (Gospel Doctrine, page 392). Parents sometimes suppose that if, they send or take their children to" Sunday School, Primary, and to the Mutual Improvement Association, they have fulfilled their obligations concerning gospel training. Far too many risk their children's spiritual guidance to chance, or to others rather than to themselves, and think that organizations suffice for religious training. Our temporal bodies would soon become emaciated, if we fed them only once a week, or twice, as some of us are in the habit of feeding our spiritual and religious bodies.... No; on the other hand, this should be done every day, and in the home, by precept, teaching and example Spend ten minutes in reading a chapter from the words of the Lord in the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, before you retire, or before you go to your daily toil. Feed your spiritual selves at home, as well as in public places (Gospel Doctrine, page 377). Nothing can take the place of religious instruction in the home. Teachings of the auxiliary organizations only augment and supplement. The foundation, the groundwork, must be given in the home. Habit can be a great aid in any endeavor. People remark, "There doesn't seem to be any time for family reading or teaching. How can we find time to give our children religious training? 'They are never at home at the same time." There are two solutions to this problem. The first is: Begin teaching your children while they are still small, when they are at home the greater part of the time, and make it your first duty to be at home with them to give them what they should have. The second solution lies in appointing a regular time, most convenient to all. Fifteen minutes will perhaps be enough. Keep to the schedule. Perhaps dinner could be set a little, early and fifteen minutes immediately afterward reserved for reading. Even if every member of the family could not be in attendance every evening, they could participate most of the time. Habit is the surest assurance of success. The benefit to be derived from even a fifteen minute period of gospel study each day cannot be estimated. What to Teach What should be included in this religious instruction? President Joseph F. Smith said: It is the duty of Latter-day Saints to teach their children the truth, to bring them up in the way they should go, to teach them the first principles of the gospel, the necessity of baptism for the remission of sins, and for membership in the Church of Christ;... Necessity of receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, which will lead them into all truth. Teach your children the love of God, teach them to love the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Teach them to love their fellow men, and especially to love their fellow members in the Church, that they may be true to their fellowship with the people of God. Teach them to honor the Priesthood, to honor the authority that God has bestowed upon his Church for the proper government of his Church.... Teach them that the Prophet Joseph Smith had restored to him the Priesthood that was held by Peter and James and John, who were ordained under the hands of the Savior himself.... Teach your children to respect their bishops and the teachers that come to their homes to teach them. Teach your children to respect old age, gray hairs, and feeble frames. Teach them to venerate and to hold in honorable remembrance their parents, and to help all those who are helpless and needy. Teach your children to honor the law of God and the law of the state and the law of our country. Teach them to respect and hold in honor those who are chosen by the people to stand at their head and execute justice and administer the law. Teach them to be loyal to their country, loyal to righteousness and uprightness and honor.... 860 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE DECEMBER 1946 LESSON DEPARTMENT Children should be taught early in life that death is really a necessity as well as a blessing, and that we would not and could not be satisfied and supremely happy without it.... No explanation of death to a child's mind can anywhere be found that is more simple and convincing than is the death of our Master, connected as it is and ever must be with the glorious resurrection (Gospel Doctrine, pp. 364, 365, 366). Children should be prepared to meet the issues of life before they come face to face with them. They should be prepared for courtship, for marriage in the temple, for the duties of parenthood. Young people going to attend universities should be taught to evaluate correctly the courses of study offered them. "Latter-day Saints accept every scientific fact, but rate theories based upon the facts as human explanations of the facts, likely to change as new facts appear.... Any theory that leaves out God as a personal, purposeful Being, and accepts chance as a first cause, cannot be accepted by Latter-day Saints." (See Widtsoe's Evidences and Reconciliations, PP- 154, 155.) That which is demonstrated, we accept with joy, but vain philosophy, human theory and mere speculations of men we do not accept, nor do we adopt anything contrary to divine revelation or to good common sense, but everything that tends to right conduct, that harmonizes with sound morality and increases faith in Deity, finds favor with us, no matter where it may be found (Gospel Doctrine, page 48). Home Evenings Church authorities advise that we make a practice of having a weekly "home evening," wherein our families may get together to discuss family affairs, study the gospel and, in general, enjoy each other's society. The home has in many cases ceased to be the center of attraction as it used to be, and members of the family often have so many outside interests that they scarcely see each other. A return to a more simple routine is advisable. The successful home evening would be a stride in this direction. Here again it is wisdom to begin early. When the children are small, conditions are ideal for setting the home evening habit? There are not many demands on the time of small children, the parents have them to themselves, and the home evening can be an occasion to be anticipated. It should be planned so that it is such. Sometimes there might be group singing around the piano, retold or reread stories, appropriate for the children, and a short discussion on proper conduct and gospel teaching. This is an excellent opportunity to teach the gospel a little at a time. If the program is varied, it will have greater appeal. Family problems might be discussed, with all old enough voicing opinions. Then games might be introduced and refreshments served. Members of the family might take turns planning the program. This would give the children a feeling of importance and encourage initiative, and the one in charge of the evening should be complimented upon the success of the evening. When the children are older, the home evening should still be continued. An evening should be chosen when most members will be at home, but if one or another cannot be in attendance, the home evening should be held anyway. All will be able to be present at least on some of the evenings, and will receive great benefit from the family gatherings. Table tennis, part singing, topics of interest in world affairs, or any other activity might be introduced to foster a close association of members of the family. Part of the time, however, should be devoted to reading or discussion of gospel principles. The maxim "Where there's a will there's a way," is very applicable to the success of the home evening project. If the will to put it over is there, it can certainly be worked out satisfactorily. Any program which becomes a fixed routine is accepted. When children are grown, they will look back on the weekly home evenings as being some of their most treasured memories times of nearness and dearness to each other. Questions for Discussion 1. Of how much importance is religious training in the home? Discuss. 2. What is the fallacy in letting children grow up and then choose the religion they wish? 3. What is the responsibility of parents in regard to religious instruction? Have someone read Doctrine and Covenants 68: 25-29. 4. What part do the auxiliaries play in gospel training? 5- What constitutes a successful "home evening'? Urge Relief Society sisters to begin home evenings among their respective families. 6. Why should the home evening be inaugurated when the children are young? 7. Have members tell of happy and profitable home evenings they have experienced. 8. A short demonstration might be given of a successful home evening program. References Doctrine and Covenants, 68:25-29.
