ls — for" Apri L gazine ar a cotie a oem To each of you, each loved and loving sister, the General Board of Relief Society extends our warmest wishes for a joyous New Year. We acknowledge with gratitude your valued contributions to the success which has attended the work of Relief Society this past year and your support of its programs. Our prayer is that you have received benefit, your life has been blessed, your happiness increased, and your knowledge expanded. As the old calendar comes down, the year 1964 becomes history. One last look at the calendar pages reveals much that is worth remembering, many days to be treasured, and, perhaps, some that brought sorrow. Good memories remain to bring a glow to living. Rewarding growth, both spiritual and mental, becomes evident in an evaluation of a year's activities. Some of the past year may be what Emily Dickinson would call an "amethyst remembrance," jewel bright, with a touch of nostalgia and a whisper 'of melancholy among its beauties. "The past is prologue" Shakespeare elucidates. That which has gone before, the prefatory act upon which what will come is based, may make the future better if wisdom is gained and judgment attained. The new calendar goes up. Twelve, new pages appear marked off into 365 days, each of which is full of promise, offering precious time to learn, to do, to achieve. They offer opportunities to give, to serve, to receive, to extend the mind, to enlarge the soul, to fulfill in fuller measure potentialities of character. The new year lies ahead, a pathway to tomorrow. It is well to walk this path with faith. It is wise to observe the guideposts along the way. It is good to walk in the company of family and friends, all with the same worthy destination. It is joyous, indeed, to take the path that Jesus trod and follow in his footsteps. May 1965 bring you greater happiness, finer accomplishment, and more dedicated devotion to the gospel. Our sincere love bears our greetings.

The Relief Society Organized by Revelation 'Tuts is a wonderful sight. It is a pleasure to stand before this vast congregation of sisters who are actively engaged in the wonderful work of salvation and in strengthening spiritually the good sisters of the Church. The Prophet Joseph Smith was divinely inspired by the Lord to give to the Church such a_ wonderful organization in which the sisters might find a most important activity, an activity which is not only beneficial to those who are called to take part, but to all who hold membership in the Church. They are in very deed sisters of mercy carrying on one of the great departments of the Church in the spirit of humility and faith, which is indeed commendable and inspired. In the days of Paul's ministry, evidently no such organization had been devised. It appears from the reading of the scriptures that in that day there was no place of importance for the sisters. Paul wrote of this condition and said: Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law. 4 President Joseph Fielding Smith of The Council of the Twelve (Address Delivered at the Officers Meeting, Relief Society Annual General Conference, September 30, 1964) And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church (I Cor. 14:34-35). How grateful we ought to be to have the privilege of living in this dispensation when the views have been expanded to be more consistent with divine truth. Moreover, there is a place in the Church in which the wives and mothers can serve. The Relief Society was revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith as a fundamental part of the gospel. Moreover, how grateful we should be for the enlightened age in which we live. The Lord has truly kept his word. Knowledge, according to his prediction, has been increased. The grand opportunity is now before every member of the Church, male and female, to give service and to obtain authority in the building up and advancement of the kingdom of God. All of this is in fulfillment of the prophetic utterances of the prophets of old. The gospel of Jesus Christ is not a system of government, the duties of which are confined solely to those who hold the divine Priesthood. There is a labor for the sisters to per-: form, responsibilities assigned to them which they can carry far more expeditiously than could their husbands who hold the divine authority of Priesthood. Nothing has been overlooked or forgotten in the restoration of the gospel. The Lord has provided ways and means by which every soul may find something to do for the advancement of the kingdom of God. There is no place in the Church for idleness. The hymn, "T Have Work Enough to Do," states this clearly. It was written by Josephine Pollard, and is as follows: I have work enough to do, Ere the sun goes down, For myself and kindred, too, Ere the sun goes down; Every idle whisper stilling With a purpose firm and willing, All my daily tasks fulfilling, Ere the sun goes down. I must speak the loving word, Ere the sun goes down; I must let my voice be heard, Ere the sun goes down; Every cry of pity heeding, For the injured interceding, To the light the lost ones leading, Ere the sun goes down. As I journey on my way, Ere the sun goes down, God's commands I must obey, Ere the sun goes down; There are sins that need confessing; There are wrongs that need redressing, If I would obtain the blessing, Ere the sun goes down. In the restoration of the gospel the Lord did not overlook anything. He says, truthfully, that the "fulness" of the gospel has been revealed. Provisions have been made so that every soul, who will, may find something to do. It appears from the writings of Paul to the members THE RELIEF SOCIETY ORGANIZED BY REVELATION of the Church in Corinth, that in that day there was no place either in civil government or in the Church for activity performed by the sisters of the Church. If they hearkened to the counsel of their husbands, their salvation would be secured. Evidently this was not the thought anciently in Israel, and may have been a condition imposed upon the people in the days of Roman and Greek dominion. We read that in earlier days of Israel women were active and had duties to perform, that there were actually prophetesses among them. Such a noted character was Deborah, who is spoken of as being a prophetess unto whom the people went for counsel, and she became a judge in Israel. It appears in the account of the exodus of Israel from Egypt, that Miriam, sister of Moses and Aaron, who is spoken of as being a prophetess (Exodus 15:20), evidently had been given authority, particularly in relation to the affairs of the women of Israel. Now, in this the greatest dispensation of all, because it is the last, the women of the Church are given some measure of divine authority, particularly in the direction of government and _ instruction in behalf of the women of the Church. The Relief Society is_ well named, for it was organized for the guidance, instruction, and development of the female members. There is no question that the Prophet Joseph Smith was divinely inspired to organize the sisters and give them duties to perform for the benefit and strengthening of the women, 5 JANUARY 1965 spiritually and temporally. Salvation is open to all, both male and female, through the faithful obedience to the principles of salvation. Surely The Church of Jesus Christ would not have been completely organized had not this wonderful organization come into existence. There are so many things that can be performed by the sisters, in nursing, teaching, and giving aid to the sisters in matters spiritually and temporally. This restoration would not have been complete without the Relief Society in which the sisters are able to accomplish a divinely appointed service so essential to the welfare of the Church. May the Lord bless you one and all. Snow at Night Christie Lund Coles This is as near to silence as earth comes — No leaf stirs, birds are still; the stencilled night Seems mesmerized by the motion of the snow, Falling as soft as breath or break of light. The earth is fleeced, there is a sheen before The lamppost near my window; and the trees Stand poised as slim swans just before their flight. The starless sky is colorless as these. ~ The heart grows quiet too before this scene Where a snow-packed wire almost, almost hums, And knows a benediction on this night As near to silence as earth ever comes.

Place of Mothers inthe Plan of C Teaching the Gospel in the Home [Address Delivered in Presidencies Department, Relief Society Annual General Conference, October 1, 1964] Mou might be interested to know the nature of the meeting from which Elder Romney and I have just come. We have done as apparently the worthies of another dispensation did. "They went to the House of the Lord and took sweet counsel together," the scriptures say. We have done that since nine o'clock this morning: Having come fasting, we have engaged in the. Holiest order of prayer; we have witnessed a rich outpouring; and I think in the language of the scriptures, "we have to take sweet counsel together.' It is just one of those meetings that brings us nigh to heaven in a place and at a time when we need so much of the blessings of the Almighty. When Brother John A: Widtsoe was alive, he used to tell us of a meeting he held at a stake conference, wherethey asked how. Long it had been since the Church had received a revelation. He stroked his chin thoughtfully and said, "Oh, probably since last Thursday." And that startled them — to realize that here and now, week by week — he knew as Elder Romney and I know — we see evidences of constant; divine guidance. Today we bear that witness to. You sisters, that there has been a real. Outpouring of spiritual light and truth. — I am glad that this body of sisters is constituted as you-are, as the presidencies, the leaders, of the Relief Society organizations of the stakesand mission districts. More and more, I think, we will come tothe time where we must, as General Authorities and general board members, instruct the leaders of the stakes and the missions, and then. Expect: you. To be so well schooled that: you are prepared and able; to move down to the next level of authority in the wards and branches and so instruct them that they are then prepared to. Instruct the people. Today, you will receive instructions regarding the Correlating Program, about which Sister Spafford in her excellent message which she delivered so ably. Yes-- terday, spoke to you. Therefore, what I shall say will be in several different categories. JANUARY 1965 First, I sat down the other night and combed through many statements about the importance of the home, to get some sort of "punch lines," if you might call it that, to give to you from the viewpoint of thinkers, leaders in various fields — how they have construed the importance of maintaining the integrity of the home. Then I am going to move to some scriptures from the various dispensations of the past, to show you how the prophets have schooled the people as to the responsibility of the parents with regard to their children. Then I am going to come down a little closer and bring to you some quotations about Family Home Night, as it has been taught to us, beginning with President Joseph F. Smith, and even statements preceding that time, about our responsibility as parents in the home. And then, finally, to get down to the specifics of the thing that we shortly will have to give to you by way of instructions, by which we hope the parents will be better prepared to do the work which the Lord has commanded them to do. I was at a conference in Idaho, and I shall not talk too specifically about it, because I nearly blundered by speaking too bluntly about the carelessness of this stake in naming a husband and wife to an organization which took them both out of the home, without leaving one or the other there to tend the children; that they ought to be careful and assign a mother to one organization so the father could be home, and then when the father had to be gone, so the mother could be home. Well, I found that I had 8 given some offense because of my statement, when stake leaders freely predicted a wholesale resignation as a result of my rather blunt: remarks. In the afternoon, I looked to have someone to support my contention. I was sitting by the stake Relief Society president, and I think she probably is here today. She had raised nine children, all of them married now, and all of them in the temple; a very successful mother; and all her life, all the time she was raising her family, she had been a leader in one of the women's organizations. So I asked her to tell us how she had been able to be a leader and yet had been able to raise such a remarkable family. This lovely sister could not have given a more perfect talk from my standpoint than if I had schooled her on what to say. She said: "In the first place, what success I have had in raising my family, I owe to my angel mother. I raised my children as my wonderful mother raised us, and that chain reaction, which she started, has gone through my family, and I hope I have transferred it on to my children." The importance of a mother was pinpointed by someone who said, ""When you teach a boy, you are just teaching another individual, but when you teach a woman or a girl, you are teaching a whole family." The second thing, she said: "I married a wonderful companion. Daddy always felt that I should be active just as well as he should be active, and so whenever we were asked to hold a position, we sat down with the bishop or the PLACE OF MOTHERS IN THE PLAN OF TEACHING THE GOSPEL IN THE HOME stake president to see if we could take the position that was being offered, and yet see that our family would not be neglected. We have worked it out all through our married life, so that our children never have been unattended. One of us has been home with the children." And then, the third thing she said was, "I have an unshakeable testimony in the divine mission of the Lord, Jesus Christ." I submit to you that there can hardly be three things said which would make for more successful motherhood than these three things mentioned by this wonderful stake Relief Society president. Someone said, "A home is a roof over a good woman." Another said, ''A hundred men may make an encampment, but it takes a woman to make a home." You will never know until you have had the experience of walking into a house without a mother and one's companion there. It is like walking into a darkened room without the light turned on. The first intimation of domestic happiness you may _ recognize when members of a family say how they love their home. That is the indication of real domestic happiness. "'Where the home is ruled according to the Word of God, angels might be asked to stay, and they would not find themselves out of their element," one thinker wrote: Households there may be, well ordered and abiding in comfort; families there may be whose various members live in harmony and love; but homes in their true sense there cannot be where there is no one whom manly choice has made a wife, and infant lips have learned to honor the name of mother. Another wrote: Six things are requisite to a happy home. Integrity must be the architect; and tidiness the upholsterer. It must be warmed by affection, lighted up with cheerfulness, and industry must be the ventilator, renewing the atmosphere and bringing in fresh salubrity day by day, while over all as a protecting canopy and glory, nothing will suffice except the blessing of God. "The best school and discipline is home; family life is God's own method of training the young," so our newspaper the other morning said. Home is the seminary of all other institutions; it is the cradle of character and Christianity. Eighty per cent of our criminals come from unsympathetic homes. The most essential element in any home is God. Christianity begins at home; we build our characters there, and what we become in after years is largely determined by our training and home environment. I heard a humble man out in one of our country stakes say something of great wisdom. Whether or not it was original with him, I do not know, but his statement was: "What we are hereafter depends on what we are after here." I think that, translated into a_ sermon, this would provide some worthwhile thoughts. To Adam, the Lord said, concerning children: And it is given unto them to know good from evil.... Wherefore, teach it unto your children, that all men, everywhere, must repent, or they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God, for no unclean thing can dwell there, or dwell in his presence; for, in the language of Adam, Man of Holiness is his name, and the name of his Only JANUARY 1965 Begetten is the Son of Man, even Jesus 'Christ, a: righteous Judge; who shall come in the meridian of time. Therefore-I give unto-you a commandment, to teach these things freely unto your children... (Moses 6:56-58). Now, that's one of the earliest instructions I could find, where parents and leaders were to teach children. King Benjamin to his people said: And ye will not suffer your children that they go hungry; or naked; neither will ye suffer that they transgress the laws of God, and fight and quarrel one with another, and: serve the devil, who is the master of sin, or who is the evil spirit which has been spoken of by our fathers, he being an enemy to all righteousness. But ye will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness; ye will teachthem to love one another, and to serve one another (Mosiah 4:14, 15). In the book of Deuteronomy, in the. Old Testament, we. Find this being said. By Moses, as the Lord instructed him: And thou shalt_love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with al] thy soul, and with all thy might. And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: And thou shalt teach them diligently: unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up (Deut. 6:5-7). Now, our leaders today have said something. From the discourses of President Woodruff, I have a quotation: I consider that the mother has a greater influence over her posterity than any other person can. Have. And the question has arisen some time "When does this education begin?" Our prophets have said, "When the spirit life from God enters into the 10 tabernacle." The condition of the mother at that time will have its effect upon the fruit of her womb; and from the birth of the child, and all through life, the 'teachings and the example of the mother govern and control in a great measure, that child, and her influence is felt by it through time and eternity. I have long been satisfied that the devil was making great exertions to drive a wedge in between parents and children — trying to inspire and instil into the minds of the sons and daughters of the Saints those corrupting notions that will prevent them from following the footsteps of their fathers and mothers: but this cannot be done! The sons. And daughters of this people, if we do our duty, will be held by the strength and in the name of Israel's God. (The Discourses of Wilford. Woodruff, pp. 269-270). President Grant has made two: very important: comments: There seems: to: be. A power which the mother -possesses in shaping the life of the child that is far superior. A mother's love seemsto be the most perfect and most sincere, the strongest of any love we know anything about. I, for one, rejoice in it because of its wonderful example to me. If we as parents will so order: our lives-that our children will know. And: realize in their hearts that we are in very deed Latter-day Saints, that. We actually knowwhat we are talking about; they, by seeking: after the Lord, wil get that same testimony (Gospel Standards, pp. 152, 154). What a tremendous comfort and. Promise that must be! President McKay has _ these comments to make: God has placed upon parents the responsibility of instilling these principles into the minds of. Children. Church schools, Sunday Schools, Mutual Improvement Associations, Primary organizations are all helps in government, established here to assist PLACE OF MOTHERS IN THE PLAN OF TEACHING THE GOSPEL IN THE HOME in the upbuilding and guidance of the youth, but none of these — great and important factors as they are in the lives of youth — can supplant the permanence and the influence of the parents in the home (Pathways to Happiness, page 118). President Joseph F. Smith said: Another great and important duty devolving upon this people is to teach their children, from their cradle until they become men and women, every principle of the gospel, and endeavor, so far as lies in the power of the parents, to instil into their hearts a love for God, the truth, virtue, honesty, honor and integrity to everything that is good. That is important for all men and women who stand at the head of a family in the household of faith. Teach your children the love of God, teach them to love the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Teach them to love their fellowmen, and especially to love their fellow members in the Church that they be true to their fellowship with the people of God. Teach them to honor the Priesthood, to honor the authority that God has bestowed upon his Church for the proper government of his Church (Gospel Doctrine, pp 292-293). And here is another quotation from President McKay: No matter what they may be without, are your homes pure within? Are morning prayers offered there regularly? Or do the things of this world take you away from your home and make you deprive yourself of morning prayers with the children? Woe to that home where the mother abandons her holy mission or neglects the divine instruction, influence, and example — while she bows, a devotee, at the shrine of social pleasure; or neglects the essential duties in her own household, in her enthusiasm to promote public reform (Gospel Ideals, page 481). Now that is well pointed, and I hope all our mothers can get the message. Then he added: ''God has placed upon you parents the responsibility of instilling these principles into the minds of children." Finally, this quotation from President Brigham Young: If you mothers will live your religion, then in the love and fear of God teach your children constantly and thoroughly in the way of life and salvation, training them up in the way they should go, when they are old they will not depart from it (Discourses of Brigham Young, page 206). The Home Teaching Program Now this coming Saturday night, President McKay has directed that the theme of the general Priesthood meeting will be a program, announced Churchwide, on teaching of the gospel in the home. In this there will be defined the beginning of the program which will be initiated beginning January 1, 1965, in which the Relief Society organization will play a very vital part. Now, one of the questions that is frequently asked, and upon which there seems to be some confusion, is with reference to the visiting teacher program of the Relief Society, which is thought, in some cases, to conflict with the Home Teaching Program. Now, may I say to you that in all our discussions as a Correlation Committee we have never thought to give direction or instruction that the Home Teaching Program should discontinue the visiting teaching program of the Relief Society. But the visiting teacher program now has an objective that is a little different and beyond an auxiliary to the Home Teaching Program. 1 JANUARY 1965 Now, for example, as I attempted to think this through, the word that you use in connection with your Relief Society work, is that of the ''compassionate service" side of Relief Society. That is contemplated in every visit in the home of the Relief Society visiting teachers. Now, in that visitation there may be such things as homemaking instructions, where you see a loosely knit home and poorly kept by a mother who doesn't understand — this might be the golden opportunity for the Relief Society to inject its instruction in that compassionate way. Watchful attention to the needs of the sick and the infirm is encompassed in the visit of the visiting teacher, and the keeping of Relief Society presidents apprised of temporal, as well as spiritual needs, also. Now, as I thought of that, I remembered something I read a year or so ago. A general from Europe had just returned from an assignment over there, where he had witnessed the terrible devastation of those great cities in Southern and Western Europe. Someone had asked him a question that followed his talk as to what he thought the greatest needs in Europe were. And he gave three words: "They need food, fuel, and faith," and then he added, "Without the latter, the first two are useless; and without the first two, the third is impossible." THAT is a true statement. Those of us who work, Brother Romney and I and you Relief Society presidents, close to the Welfare Program, can tell that when a home is shattered because 12 of the needs of food and shelter and clothing and fuel, that the first thing we have to do is to build a sense of security, a sense of material well-being, before we can begin to lift the family to the plane where we can instil in them, faith. That is the beginning, but unless we have the objective of what we do as to the building of faith, the mere giving of material aid fails. Now, we must understand that, if we just try to build faith without first filling their stomachs and seeing that they are properly clothed and properly housed and properly warmed, perhaps we will fail in the building of faith. Relationship of Relief Society to the Home Teaching Program Now, in order to give to the sisters a perspective of this responsibility which is coming to them, I would like first to introduce that by showing the relationship which the Relief Society should have with the Home Teachers. I am talking now of the Priesthood Home Teachers. We have had some confusion, as you can understand, when a new program is announced, there is always some lack of comprehension in the beginning of any new program or plan. We try to explain with the best vocabulary we have, which is sometimes very limited; and then, unfortunately, the people who listen have a worse vocabulary to listen with than we have to talk with; and with that limited equipment we try to get across a few ideas. I have often said to the brethren that the all-important thing is not what we say at a. Stake PLACE OF MOTHERS IN THE PLAN OF TEACHING THE GOSPEL IN THE HOME conference or at a general conference, but the all-important thing is what people think we said. That is the important thing. Well, now, some people have thought we said certain things that we did not say, or at least, we have repented of, if we seemed to have said it; and it is now about some of these things I wish to speak. Now about the Primary Home Partnership. Said that seemed to negate all of that good work of the Primary trying to carry the Primary lessons into the home; and likewise the Sunday School had a similar kind of program. We_ were asked to make some comments about that. The Ward Council Meeting One of the weekly meetings of the executive committee of each Priesthood group in the ward is to be held each month, and is resolved into what we call a ward council meeting, where all the heads of the auxiliaries and all the heads of the Priesthood groups will meet together. The bishop will bring to this group the assignments which need to be made to the auxiliaries. The place of the auxiliary is there determined, primarily by the outcome of the studies or the visits of the Home Teachers, as revealed by oral or written reports, which are sifted by the secretary of the Home Teaching committee, or assistant ward clerk, and the bishopric. Relationship Between Priesthood Home Teachers and Auxiliary Workers on Enlistment There have been some questions asked relative to the Some things were | relationship between Priesthood Home Teachers and the auxiliary workers, relating to enlistment work necessary for an individual child or adult member. During last month we held a seminar of all Priesthood representatives of the four Priesthood committees — Home Teaching, Missionary, Genealogy, and Welfare. In that meeting, this very question came up, and in the discussion, they seemed to draw an interesting distinction between the enlistment work necessary for a longtime inactive family or one which had never been active, and the infrequent absence of a child who had skipped going to Sunday School or who had skipped going to Primary for a week or more. The enlistment work can be considered as one thing, the visit of a child who is ill or occasionally absent, is another. In one stake I visited I conferred with the Relief Society and Primary board workers, after their all-day sessions with stake leaders, and I found that only fifty per cent of the mothers in that stake were enrolled in Relief Society; and there were 225 children of Primary age who were not participating in Primary. Whose business is this? Is this just the business of the Relief Society and the teachers of the various classes? Is it just the business of the Primary and the teachers of the Primary classes? It is the business of the total Priesthood of the Church to see, so far as it is possible, that every mother is induced to come to Relief Society, and that every child of Primary age is induced to participate in the Primary program. Now, by analogy, that means 13 JANUARY 1965 MIA age, Sunday School, and sO on. Illustrations. The bishop should have on his -agenda for this council meeting, when all the auxiliary heads are there with the Priesthood workers and the bishopric, the special items that pertain to specific problems. 'Women are not to be called to serve as Home Teachers, but they may go by specific assignment if the bishop, after consultation with the Home Teachers, feels that in a given case, for a month or two or more, it would be a benefit to a particular family because of a particular situation. Well now, I think it is understandable in a case like that, as Sister Spafford observed when we were talking about this, if there has been given a special assignment to Family A, for a special sister to work with a special case, for that period of specialized work, the visiting teachers might not be asked to visit that home, because they might confuse this specialist's work already going forward. Now, whether or not there will be one or more or many visits will depend upon the results of the discussion of the bishop with his Home Teachers, and then with the specific auxiliary concerned. It may be Relief Society; it may be MIA; it may be Sunday School; it may be Primary. The hope is that we are not too far away, maybe a year away, from having not just a Primary Home Partnership or a Sunday School Home Partnership, but a total Church Home Partnership. It will bring all the lessons for a 14 I merely use these as planned and responsible teaching into the home. In other words, we are giving parents now for this year lessons that they are going to teach their children — actually planned lessons, for parents to teach in the home. And we hope this will become a total partnership program, involving not just the Primary and the Sunday School, but every organization.. Now, these are two phases which you must keep in mind when you tackle this subject. Don't just say, "Now, since this Home Teaching program, we are not getting as many new members out as we used to before." Well, if you are not, it is your fault. You sit in on that monthly ward council meeting, and if that ward council meeting is not being held, or you are not invited into it, then somebody ought to be harassed and importuned until that meeting is held; and you ought to be so alert to the needs of your organization that not one member who ought to be in Relief Society is overlooked by the Home Teachers, and that plans are made for an orderly recruitment of all members into Primary, or the Mutual Improvement Association, or the Sunday School, as the case may be. If you can do this, if you will have in mind that what we are planning now is a program that will reach every member of the Church, and when anyone comes complaining that we have fallen off in this or that because of the Home Teaching Program, we ask them, why don't you ask to be allowed to participate more fully in the specific. Cases where the Home Teachers are not effective, PLACE OF MOTHERS IN THE PLAN OF TEACHING THE GOSPEL IN THE HOME or where the Home Teachers have not fully sensed that they need a specialist's work in order to enlist some-members of the family who are not now active? Teaching the Gospel in the Home With that in mind, Sister Spafford told you that there will be given to you now a lesson once a month in: the Relief Society. I have 'before me the first lesson which they have proposed in this 'series, the teaching of which will commence the first of the year. I am going to read you one or two paragraphs, which can say this 'better than I do, to give you the perspective: In order to cooperate fully with this program, the Latter-day Saint mother must understand the place of the family in the divine "scheme of things." She must strive to establish the kind of relationship among family members that will be favorable to an acceptance of this gospelteaching program. She should realize that her attitude will be an important influence for good or a deterrent to the progress of the work, and she, herself, must become more informed as to the primciples of the restored gospel. The purpose of these Relief Society lessons is, therefore, to help the mother become an effective instrunrent with her husband in_ teaching the gospel to the family. How often, in past years, have you heard a Latter-day Saint mother say, "IT wish my husband 'could have heard the discussion today. Had he done so, I am'sure he would feel differently about a particular problem we have in our home." It is a realistic observation that with widely divergent points of view, the efforts of one parent often may nullify the efforts of the other parent, sometimes with great detriment to the persons involved and to the problem which needs. To be resolved. The correlation of these -lessons with those being studied -by the Priesthood quorums. Can be of great value, since it will bring to both parents an awareness of their joint respansibility to teach their children the fundamentals of the. Gospel. In fact, it is hoped that through a mutual understanding of this responsibility, Latterday Saint parents will work unitedly to meet this teaching. ChaHenge, and that they will strive earnestly to bring a fullness of the blessings of the gospel into their -homes. And then they summarize with these important instructions: To assist parents in carrying out the responsibility given them by the Lord, the leaders of the Church through inspiration have. Developed the home 'program, which is a Priesthood administrative responsibility. The 'Family Home Evening Program will involve every member of the Church, for its fundamental concern is that every Church member be more fully instructed m Church doctrine. "Therefore, every family unit, however scomposed, 'should participate in the instruction program." Couples without children, a single person living alone, roommates, as well as families, can all benefit from ~the newly instituted program. The lessons will include material adapted to the particular needs of special types of families, where such adaptation is necessary. An instruction period, similar to that planned for the family night, is to be held. In addition to the gospel lessons, the manual gives suggestions for family activities which should set a general clmmate for the home throughout the month. 'Then they conclude with this: Each year the lessons in the Family Home Evening Program manual will consider fundamental principles of the gospel, and they will deal with four universal concerns of the Latterday Saints. The emphasis will be placed upon application of the truths 15 JANUARY 1965 in these universals. Lessons prepared for Priesthood quorums and Relief Society will likewise emphasize the importance of translating the gospel teachings into action. The relationship of the individual to his family, to others, and to the community will be emphasized. Now can you see that plan in action? Mothers being taught in a monthly lesson in Relief Society, fathers in their weekly Priesthood meeting; a lesson actually planned for the parents in the home in a family manual; and then the Home Teachers once a month, given instructions to check to see that the parents understand how these lessons are to be taught, and any questions or problems ironed out. In other words, we are not going to be like someone said: ""You talk about it, but what have you done about it?" Now, these are some definite fundamental steps which you, as the leaders of the women of the Church, must implement. Now this is the thing we want you to carry out. We must do our jobs so well in these lessons that we give to every mother her fundamental instructions necessary for her to know what her place is with her husband in the teaching of the gospel to the children in the home. Now, with these things that I have read you preliminary to this, you begin to get something of what our leaders have urged. I said here, you are not to be Home 'Teachers, so appointed regularly as such. In one of the stakes, the first month, we took a look at it, and half of the Home Teachers were women, and I think if we had gone another 16 three months, all the Home Teaching would have been done by the Relief Society. We would have had no Home Teachers. You are to stand ready to assist the Home Teachers, in a manner directed by the bishop. And you are to instruct your leaders in that ward council meeting to plead constantly and urge your Priesthood leaders, if you feel that your part of the work is not receiving the specific attention that it deserves and needs to save some particular home situation; and then to give specific aid to mothers who are struggling with insurmountable problems. Problems That Beset Us Today Only yesterday Sister Lee and I ran into two problems that are right here. One of them: a mother called to say, "Our son is attending college, and every day his teacher is indoctrinating him with socialism, and what are we going to do about it?" she asked. And another, a fine, handsome boy just starting to college said, "Every day I attend this particular class in philosophy there have been created doubts in my mind and questionings of the faith and _ teachings of the Church. How can I rise above it?" That is the problem, probably, of every home where they have college sons and daughters. Now what is the answer? The answer is, or the solution is that we fortify our children by giving them truths on which they can build a testimony that will fortify them against these things which are in the world and striking at the faith of our children. PLACE OF MOTHERS IN THE PLAN OF TEACHING THE GOSPEL IN THE HOME In a recent book on science and religion the author states his belief that there is abroad in the world today a great revival in religion, and that this revival is a challenge to scientists and religious leaders to cooperate in working for the hopes and dreams of mankind. A Challenge to the Church The greatest challenge the Church has today is to proclaim the faith of their fathers in the language of the children of today. And that, I submit to you, is, in one sentence, the challenge that we face in this program of teaching the gospel in the home. I came across an address that President Clark delivered to the conference of the Relief Society sometime ago, in which he said: Thus the Latter-day Saint family, in a Latter-day Saint home, has three great functions to perform. First, — it must bring to its members such lives as will enable them to return to the inner circles of that celestial home from which they came, — a dwelling with the Heavenly Father and Mother throughout' the eternities. Second, — it must so carry out its duties, rights, and functions as to enable it, in turn, to found a celestial home that shall in some eternity hereafter be equal in power, opportunity, and dignity with the celestial home from which we came and to which we shall return. Third, — it must so live its life as to provide for the spirits yet waiting to come to this earth for their fleshly tabernacles, both bodies and minds that shall be healthy, for the spirits coming through them are the choice spirits, which have earned the right by their lives in their first estate, to come for their second estate, to the righteous homes — to the families of greatest worth, promise, and opportunity; and this family must provide for this spirit which it invites to come to its hearthstone, an environment that shall meet the strictest requirements of righteousness (The Relief Society Magazine, December 1940, page 808). Now those are powerful observations — three great family functions. Well, perhaps I have said enough and maybe a summary of that is to say something that is a bit delicate and a bit personal, but all of us who go as General Authorities throughout the Church or sit in our offices, are confronted almost constantly with a question. Here is a lovely mother who is struggling against the odds of a faithless husband, or one who will not be active in the Church and will not do anything, and the question of the mother is should she withdraw from that husband and seek a separation with the thought that if they cannot work out a happy home life here, then why try to think of getting into the temple to be sealed for eternity? Now we have had that problem constantly before us. Let me read you something which President Brigham Young said that I think strikes at this thing and gives to you, as leaders, something on which you ought to dwell constantly whenever distraught mothers come to you with any such thoughts as to pull away from the husband because he is not presently giving the attention to the Church that he ought. President Young said: I know you good women get annoyed and provoked and out of patience many times with your husbands; and at times, justly so. They are not always as considerate of you VW JANUARY 1965 as they ought to be; but if they provide for you, they are kind to you, and otherwise treat you right, stay with them. I think it has been taught by some that as we lay our bodies down, they will so rise again in the resurrection with all the impediments and imperfections that they had here; and that if a wife does not love her husband in this state she cannot love him in the next. This is not so. Those who attain to the blessings of the first or celestial resurrection will be pure and holy, and perfect in body. Every man and woman who reaches to this unspeakable attainment will be as beautiful as the angels that surround the throne of God. If you can, by faithfulness in this life, obtain the right to come up in the morning of the resurrection, you need entertain no fears that the wife will be dissatisfied with her husband or the husband with the wife; for those of the first resurrection will be free from sin and from the consequences and power of sin. This body is "sown in corruption, it is raised. In incorruption; it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body." "And as we have borne the image of the earthly, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly" (Journal of Discourses 10, page 24). Now, let me close with an illustration. Sister Lee and I were back at the time of the Singing Mothers on the East Coast, when they put on that remarkable presentation, as President Tanner told you yesterday, that resulted in a tremendous publicity all over the country. They left hundreds and hundreds of children, with husbands, we hope, to be attended somewhere and cared for while the mothers were gone. There came up at the close of that meeting a lovely singer, who sang one of the solo parts. She had been a convert of only 18 a year or two before, and she had been singing with the Metropolitan Opera Company. But she said she recalled that I had been back to the stake conference where she lived, and we had talked about temple marriage while there, and her husband was a professor in a university back there. Despite all her efforts to try to get him interested he just pulled away, wanted to have nothing to do with it. Furthermore he was urging her to go his way into activities contrary to the standards of the Church. Well, I suppose I had laid a pretty heavy hand on the small percentage of temple marriages, and on those who were not working up towards a sealing in the temple. This sister came up as the conference closed, and asked me, "What am I going to do about it?" She told me just a bit about her home situation, and she reminded me. It shocked me when I heard her say it. (I can think how it shocked her when I said it.) She said, 'You said, in answer to my question 'Well, I don't understand that the Lord ever expected a woman to follow her husband to hell!'"' And so, stiffened by that rather stern and, perhaps a bit crude, perhaps inspired, comment, she thought, "This is ever the time to strike," so she went home to her husband. (He had been in that session, by the way.) She didn't tell us the whole story of what may have happened and what he said back to her. She left that to our imagination, but then, as the tears came rolling down her cheeks, she said, "Today is our PLACE OF MOTHERS IN THE PLAN OF TEACHING THE GOSPEL IN THE HOME fifteenth wedding anniversary, and my husband is being baptized tonight a member of the Church." And he was back there to help, as one of those appointed to take care of all the physical arrangements for the Singing Mothers as they arranged themselves for that great concert. It is that kind of salvation which maybe some faithful wife will have to help her husband one day to achieve. Remember what the apostle Paul said, "The unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife." Now, I am not talking of a husband who is unfaithful to the point of endangering his wife's health, immoral, and probably has almost deprived himself of the right of life itself, but I am talking merely of one who presently seems to show no interest, or has his mind presently upon worldly things. If we will do our part as mothers, wives, with patience and prayer, and with the power of the Priesthood now concentrated, as we hope it will be, we may hope in the years that lie ahead to see a tremendous resurrection of interest, unity, faith, and the strengthening of the Latter-day Saint homes of this people. Now, dear, sisters, you must give leadership to this. It will not go unless the mothers take the initiative in many homes. Put father in his place and urge him to take that place, and help him to be the teacher and leader that the Lord expects fathers to be, as holders of the Priesthood. So I leave you my blessing this afternoon, again expressing my great delight at what I heard of the general session. How proud I was to hear your President, Sister Spafford, and these wonderful counselors. I think the word "great" is not an exaggeration — to say these are great women who are leading you, loyal, devoted, untiring, faithful. Sister Spafford has attained a world-wide stature. When she goes to foreign lands, she is well known to women's groups everywhere. She has addressed them on many occasions. She will leave this conference shortly to go to one similar conference back East. She has earned her place because she has maintained her standards and she has taught the gospel of Jesus Christ. I am grateful to be here in the presence of Brother Romney. I think his talk to you yesterday was one of the finest expressions on one of the great needs of developing an awareness of the Spirit and how we must strive to get that Spirit and keep it. I think that is something that ought to be printed and reprinted and read and re-read, as Brother Romney has given it to you yesterday. May I say, parenthetically, that the loyalty that brought him from a long meeting to sit through this hour, that may not have been, shall I say, too engaging, indicates the kind of loyalty and strength that I have always felt in Elder Marion G. Romney, than whom I have never known a more loyal, a more faithful, and a more dear companion in the earnest work that belongs to the kingdom of God. I commend what has been said and done and commend you to the further responsibilities that 19 JANUARY 1965 this new program will place squarely upon you as leaders. You must teach it now to those who work under your direction, and don't just let this go for your instruction; but for you to see that those who work under you are given instructions. I bear you my testimony that this has come, as all such instructions do come, by the inspiration, revelations of the Lord to this people in this day — to concentrate the forces of the kingdom to combat the evils and the insurmountable problems that are coming upon homes, which can _ only be stemmed as we teach our children the gospel of Jesus Christ. And so I bear humble testimony and leave you my blessing in the name of Jesus Christ. 20 Pine Knots and Irritations Mabel Jones Gabbott The door was made of the forest pine, rough hewn And varnished lightly against the rain and snow; The knots, like jewels in the sun's rich glow, Sang of its reaching like a glad tree tune. | thought of oysters on the inlet shore, Producing pearls from irritations, dust Specks in a foreign field, small hurts that must In healing make jewels in its very core.

FIRST PRIZE POEM Lenora Hansen The wind blew in my valley, The always, everlasting wind. -Rabbits scooted through its sand drive For the shelter of gray cedar bark. A coyote sent his lonely cry upon its crest. A hawk sailed its up current And swooped in its down draft. Red sand was hurled against raw earth; And cedars clawed beneath the rock For gust lashed rain. Wind's minor cadence sang my lullaby. Wind waited for the child, outside the schoolroom door, And swept him, racing, down the street. Youth turned his face and strode into wind's blast. Wind whispered in the place where lovers meet. Wind howled around the cabin of the man and wife And the young babe. It flung its grit into your teeth, And blasted new-sown crops And scoured the sky And winnowed souls, And knifed through sham and pomp, And bade man send his roots down deep — Or die! A still small voice spoke underneath the whirl; The night wind bore a soul back to its God And keened the funeral hymn. | am sick for red sand Blown against raw earth. | must turn home. SECOND PRIZE POEM ° Pearle M. Olsen They come to us naked and dependent, Having nothing but instinct To aid their grasp at existence. And we warm-clothe them And suckle their searching lips. We cuddle and cherish them, And the miracle of nature Is made manifest before our eyes, As mystified, we witness growth. And in our strength we take the gentle clay Into our fumbling hands, Knowing the intelligence within Makes of the substance something special, Even something precious and infinite. And with lowered heads, and eyes, and hearts We seek for high direction In the molding of the buoyant clay, And in the fashioning of it. We sometimes falter as we are led To work the mold, and, groping For a design, we sometimes stumble Because of our limited sight. Then, with renewed patience, We smooth the rough, polish the smooth, So character is shaped In the souls of models of comeliness. And we sing in our happiness! Then quietly, as butterflies emerging From their warm chrysalis, One, then too soon, another Of the models of beauty, stretches, Flutters, and firmly floats on wings, As do all butterflies. And we awake one day to wonder About the transitory nature of time And the intangible past years Of unfolding, of doing, earning, And spending. And now in this year Of slower feet and tired hands, We pause longer to reflect, with longing In our hearts, about the tender clay And the symbolic flight of butterflies. Then we are prompted to tune our ears to the clamor of empty rooms Swelling with hoarded echoes!; } 24 Love's Gifts Lila Bennett Spencer When spring came the children danced with magic feet Across the bald, uneven fields, | To find the flowers' hiding places. Bright buffalo beans in gay profusion spilling from their arms, They ran to greet their mother. | With worship at her fingertips, she took their proffered blooms, And all the glory that was spring Was captured in their rooms. In June they found the wild rose blooming — A tiny splash of color on the plains, | And clusters shy beside the road. Not minding thorns, their eager fingers plucked, And made a wreath to give her. She smelled the sweetness; put them in her hair, 4 And al! The loveliness of earth Seemed centered there. They told her when the rainbow came, After a fickie spat of rain, One parched and heavy summer day. She stopped her work, and raised her eyes to drink the beauty in, And on her cheeks the soft tears lay. "Sheer gossamer,'' they heard her raptly cry. "How like a bolt of fairy silk Suspended in the sky!"' When autumn came, and leaves ali orange and brown, Hung listlessly upon the trees, They heard the wild geese call. She stood there, with her arms around them alli, as overhead They watched the ordered flight. Her lips were silent, but her trembling arms said more, Shared freedom's wondrous pull, and urged Each sluggish soul to soar. Through ail the months, Through all the years, They brought her gifts. She took them in her ample hold. Sometimes in tears, Sometimes in smiles, And gave them back An hundredfold. Lenora Hansen, af lives in Snowflake, Ari local ward and Ss yet been Publj 'S.

A 25 The Relief Society General Board is pleased to announce the award winners in the Annual Relief Society Short Story Contest, which was announced in the May 1964 issue of the Magazine, and which closed August 15, 1964. The first prize of seventy-five dollars is awarded to Venda Brown Castleberry, Provo, Utah, for her story ''Heart Room.'' The second prize of sixty dollars is awarded to Lael J. Littke, Monterey Park, California, for her story ''Among Strangers.'' The third prize of fifty dollars is awarded to Norma A. Wrathall, Sunnyvale, California, for her story ''A Doll for Emarita.'"'. The Annual Relief Society Short Story Contest was first conducted by the Relief Society General Board in 1942, as a feature of the Relief Society Centennial observance, and was made an annual contest in 1943. The contest is open to Latter-day Saint women who have had at least one literary composition published or accepted for publication in a periodical of recognized merit. The three prize-winning stories will be published consecutively in the first three issues of The Relief Society Magazine for 1965. Fifty-five stories were entered in the contest for 1964, including submissions from Canada, Australia, England, and Wales. Mrs. Castleberry is a firsttime winner in the contest; Mrs. Littke is represented for the second time; and Mrs. Wrathall is a fourth-time winner. The contest was initiated to encourage Latter-day Saint women to express themselves in the field of fiction. The General Board feels that the response to this opportunity continues to increase the literary quality of The Relief Society Magazine and aids the women of the Church in the development of their gifts in creative writing. This year's submissions were of an excellent quality. Prize-winning stories are the property of the General Board of Relief Society and may not be used for publication by others except upon written permission from the General Board. The General Board reserves the right to publish any of the other stories submitted, paying for them at the time of publication at the regular Magazine rate. A writer who has received the first prize for two consecutive years must wait for two years before she is again eligible to enter the contest. 26 Venda Brown Castleberry FIRST PRIZE-WINNING STORY Annual Relief Society Short Story Contest I was bringing grandpa home to live with us, and I hadn't even talked it over with Jim. Grandpa was asleep on the back seat now, as the tires whispered on the highway, unraveling it around gently rising hills and spinning it out in a gray-black ribbon up the valley behind. Asleep. Like a child, I thought, trusting the dangers of the road to another's hands. At the beginning we trust so much, we need so much. Calves, lambs, babies — all knowing that if they call for help there is something — an inborn something — in another that will answer their need. But at the end — why is there no answer? "Come on," I. Said _ aloud, switching on the radio, ''what is there about driving on a long road that brings out the philosopher in me? As Jim would say, 'My feet just don't fit on a limb.' " I wished that a_ telephone booth — a real one — would pop up in one of the heat mirages that made shimmering lakes in the road ahead. I needed to hear Jim's voice. After fifteen years of marriage, the tone of a voice tells a lot. It would tell me how Jim felt about Grandpa coming to us. I had tried to call, but, of course, Jim, children, everyone had been in the hay field. A telegram that the operator would call to the ranch had been the best I could do. "Listen, Hon," Jim said, after he had read Aunt Liz's letter, "why don't you get in the car and drive on down? She's right, you know, some of us should be there, and your Mom being in the hospital and all. I wish I could be with you!" But the hay was down, and we all scanned the sky each morn- 27 ing, hoping we could get the winter's supply of feed up before rain turned it to a musty, black waste. And Jim was the one who led the haying crew, early to late. My hands were sweaty and achy; I had gripped the steering wheel hard, thinking of the family meeting called to decide 'what to do about Grandpa." * * K T uty 'were all waiting when I got there, in the living room of the old house, with Grandpa on the other side of the sliding doors, waiting like the accused while the jury is out deliberating. "He simply cannot stay alone any longer," Aunt Liz had said, "it's a disgrace to the family, that's what it is! The things he does — people are starting to say he's — he's — well, funny. He 28 won't use the new range we got him — insists on building a fire in that old wood stove out in the cabin to roast those awful old potatoes, which he ~ certainly shouldn't eat at his age, half done and all. And he forgets — and with the fire and all." My cousin Claire broke in. "Sister Moss says she offered to do up his shirts and take his suit to the cleaners, but he told her his wife always sees to it that the family's clothes are ready for Sunday. That old suit — we tried to get him to buy a new one, but he wouldn't. And _ those awful old wide silk ties — spots of food spilled all over." Claire moved closer to Dick, there on the old leather lounge, and put her hand on his knee. "We took Dick's grandma to Resthaven the other day. It's as Dick says, they like to be with other old people. When there are little ones around you camt " Aunt Lucy couldn't wait to get in her two cents' worth. "You remember when we took him over Easter? Well, it didn't work out at all." Uncle Burt nodded his head up and down to reinforce his wife's words. As if he's about to shout Hallelujah and amen, I had thought. Aunt Lucy went on, 'When there're young people dating and all — so embarrassing. One night Ellie came home with her beau, and they were sitting out in the car and Father went out — in his nightgown, mind you — and told Ellie to come in the house. Burt and I weren't even home — and a mercy, probably, too, or I'm afraid there'd have been words! He acts as if he can't hear, but if you notice, he can hear what he wants to — like Ellie's beau's car that night. I tell you, there's no house big enough for three generations!"' My Uncle Charles took his cue here. He built houses for a living. "That's just it," he said, "with these planned homes the way they are, there's no place to put extra people. They're built for a certain sized family, and that's it. Why, a family just about has to move when there's a new baby! Sure don't know where we'd put Papa — and I know youv're all in the same boat." While he was talking I had looked through the window at the log cabin just outside the yard fence. Just HEART ROOM "It's so small!' I had said to Grandpa once, after I had first been away to college, "how did you ever raise eight children in there?" Grandpa had stooped to pull up a pigweed near the old wooden step, straightened to look over the hand-niched logs, graybleached by weather and time. I watched his face and knew this was going to be a serious answer. "Yes, it does seem little, don't it though, out here by the big one. But it never did seem little or big or any size to Diana and me, those years. It was our home, and it just naturally stretched to cover us all — first Diana and me, and then her mother was widowed and she came to us. "The babies came along — I don't remember ever wondering if there was room — our. Home just took them in, and they had their share, just like your heart takes them all in — without getting one whit bigger in actual size." Grandpa had twisted a cobweb that hung from the doorway around his finger. "T can just see Diana spreading out quilts on the floor to make an extra bed, the company all the time saying that it was too much trouble, and they really ought to go on. She'd give the quilt a flip to straighten it out and say, 'Don't say another thing about it now! Where there's heart room, there's always house room!' "' * Ke OK * I turned for a quick look in the back seat now. Such a slight figure, really, not nearly covering the seat. He had given me so much. What had I been doing 29 JANUARY 1965 these years that I hadn't seen him change from the Grandpa of my needful years, to this Grandpa who had run out of giving, and who had today been judged for his crime? "Oh, Jim, I couldn't listen any more," I whispered aloud, ''and now you and the kids are involved, and it wasn't right not to talk it over with you, but, Jim, what if it had been you, with a roomful of people talking as if you were some old thing — like — like a furnace or something that they had to do something about? They don't remember, Jim, they just don't want to remember!"' kK K There had been more uncomfortable excuses. There had been more reinforcing looks between spouses. Suddenly my voice was speaking, and I wondered who had turned it on. "If you all don't care, I'd like to take Grandpa home with me. The last thing Jim said to me was 'bring him home with you if he'll come.' " They were relieved. They tried to object a little, to warn me. But they were relieved. "You don't know what you're getting into," Claire had _ said. "He's cross with children now. He just wants to sit. I don't know how — food all over when he eats — they get so slovenly — you won't dare have anyone im " Uncle Charles said, "Maybe we could build him a little place on the back of your house, so's he'd be kind of away from the family." Aunt Lucy was the speakingout one. She said, "I tell you, he doesn't care where he is — why should he when he can't hear 30 thunder — or at least acts like he can't — lives in the past, and when he does join in talking that's all he'll talk about. I still think a good rest home." I hadn't felt angry. I knew they were all truthful in what they said. But, I had felt sick, sort of, the way you do when a child is abused — as if in not protecting the helpless, the family — and the whole world — were somehow losing their dignity. * eK K OF THE sun sank behind the hills to the right, its reflected light turning them into purple-black, cardboard shapes, with a black fringe of pines outlining their curves against the mauve sky I turned the headlights on. It was as if their beam pulled the car along through darkness. There were just Grandpa and I. The hum of the motor and the whisper of the tires powered a_ time-machine that hurtled us backward, and we were once again a little girl and her Grandpa — in the needing and the giving years. Grandpa had always made me feel as if I were his favorite in all the world. Cherished and loved. In a world where grownups were often unpredictable, he was always the same, my security and my refuge. Mother might be cross, father punish unjustly, brother might run away and hide from me, but Grandpa was there to make me feel loved and accepted again. We had a little game. When I would cry, he would say, "Come here and let me count your ribs." We both knew that I was too ticklish to let him count past the third one! By that time I was giggling and squirming — my reason for crying forgotten. The healing was complete when I was on his lap, my ear over the ticking watch in his overalls pocket. I loved the way Grandpa looked. His hair was auburn, with a suggestion of gray, thick and curly. His eyes were a lively brown under bushy red eyebrows. His mustache drooped down, cut short so that you could see the crinkles at the corners of his mouth. I could always tell if Grandpa was going to speak seriously or jokingly, just by watching those crinkles. He was so clean! It was an ever-living wonder to me that he washed his hair and mustache every time he washed his face! Such splashing and blowing noises he would make as he bent over the low washbench in a corner of the kitchen. First a good lather, then a rinse with many dippersful of cold water from the pail nearby. The comb was in the oilcloth wall pocket above the washbench, under the mirror. Grandpa would flex his knees a bit as he scrunched to look into the mirror. He would part his mustache, comb it carefully, and then comb his hair until it lay in crisp waves. SometTiMes Grandpa and I would get to stay home alone all day — just the two of us. We would have baked potatoes for lunch, crispy on the outside, with golden butter melting into their fluffy insides — and plenty of salt and pepper. Grandpa would brew "peppermint tea' for us, and add lots of sugar and milk. Sipping this from a china cup with a grownup saucer under it was living! The first time my brother and HEART ROOM I were to be left alone for the evening, I felt utterly deserted. When I heard the crunch of the buggy wheels outside, and knew everybody — even Grandpa — was gone, I wailed like a Banshee. "Don't cry, Sis,' my brother said, to comfort me, "Grandpa's in the other room." Well, if Grandpa was there, the world was right-side-up again. I went to sleep. It was many years later that we learned that Grandpa was in the other room. The sight of my woebegone face was too much for him; he stayed to listen, to see how I got along! The gifts Grandpa gave me were right from one heart to another. There were always hard, round peppermint candies in his inside coat pocket when he came. One night he opened his coat as if to invite me to have some candy, and there I touched a coalblack puppy, his eyes shining from his dark, warm hiding place. Such a surge of love and _ protectiveness I felt, as I snuggled his cold, wet little nose down to my neck! Grandpa was never too busy to go for a walk with me. I would put my hand in his and away we'd go, skirting the barnyard, crossing two canals on wobbly plank bridges, running the last little way to the orchard fence. This was adventure to a fouryear-old! Sometimes Grandpa would hand his hat to me, and up a tree he'd go, and down again, with birds' eggs to show me. If there was a robin's egg, he would hold it up to my face and tell me it was just the color of my eyes. I learned from Grandpa how sad Mrs. Bird would be if she came home and 31 JANUARY 1965 found even one egg missing. We must put them all back, and not handle them very much. If there were babies in the nest, we would sit down under the tree and be very quiet, in hopes that Mrs. Bird would heed her babies' discordant ''peep-peeps" and come to feed them. When she did, we would watch them stretch their bare, wrinkled necks up above the edge of the nest, their mouths wide open to take the squirming worms Mrs. Bird dropped in. One day we watched the devotion of a mother bird — her patience — as she taught her newly feathered fledglings to fly. One day we saw Trixie the cat kill a bird. Grandpa talked to me about it, gently. Trixie was not cruel; she was doing what Heavenly Father expected her to do. He had given her rules to obey, too, but what was wrong for us was not always wrong for animals. THERE must have been times when I tried his patience, but I had no memory of a cross word from my Grandpa. There must have been times when he was tired — when his own affairs weighed heavily upon him, but I found him always ready with the comfort, the support, the protection I needed. By the gift of his utter love and absolute devotion Grandpa had given me an unforgettable memory of warm security. His was the kind of love that every child should have from someone, sometime. A sudden wrench of the steering wheel startled me. I had turned off the highway into the loose gravel of our ranch road. Under the gateway with the 32 tangle of deer antlers across the top, and our brand burned at crazy angles all over the bleached gray poles; off the gravel and onto the dusty road that led to the yard fence. The lights were on all over the house. The living room curtains moved. The yard light went on, and the porch light. I prayed a quick prayer as I stopped the car, "Oh, Jim, it's for the little girl with her hand in her Grandpa's — but for you and me, too — when we're old and funny." I was out and around the car. Jim was through the litile gate. So big, so alive, so shiny clean, with comb marks in his damp hair! But I had to feel him, hear him, to know if it was all right. We kissed, hard, and then looked at each other for a long moment, there by the car, with Grandpa inside. "T tried to call. " I said. Jim said, "I know. Elsie told me when she phoned out the message. You didn't need to, you know." My face started to crumple up. I felt it start in my knees and spread all over me. When I felt my face breaking up, I put my hands over it, pushing hard. Jim took my hands down, and I could feel his hands over my ears — holding the hair out and away from my head, while he kissed my forehead, down to my nose, and then my salty lips. "Baby, it's all right. It's all right. After you left I kicked myself for not telling you to bring him home with you. I figured vou'd have a rough time — I should have gone." I was feeling for a handkerchief. Jim handed me a clean folded one from his back pocket. "There will be times when we " I said, but Jim had turned to open the back car door. HEART ROOM me help you. It's been a long trip for an old-timer like you. You must be tired plumb out." There was no reproach in his voice — for either Grandpa or me. "Grandpa!" he was saying, "I thought you'd never get here.

The New Year is a sunrise of promise, a time for considering our present place in the lifetime journey, and the pathway we will choose for the purpose of the years. This sunrise of the new day and the New Year comes to each of us — to those who have cause for rejoicing, and to all who must search their hearts for hope and courage; the sunrise comes to those who walk in strength, and to those who must, at times, lean on others. The morning of the New Year comes with special sounds and special silence to the mother in the home where children begin their early adventures — even before the time of morning prayer. Then, when the silence comes to the circle of faith, there is the feeling of unity in that pattern and in that family, which, though it will be changed, will never be lost. The father's voice is a blessing to his family, and it will be long remembered. The mother's bowed head and the quietness of the children will be a sheltering peace over many years. It seems a rich dwelling place to many women when they consider the blessed walls of home, the doors and the windows — the domain of shaping and sharing — of bending and straightening — the homeplace — so large and so wide that there is neither earthly nor heavenly limitation to its influence. Each task, whether simple or com- plex, difficult or smooth — each triumph and each sorrow are part of the day that follows the morning and looks always toward another year and another morning. The New Year and the new morning are for every young mother and every older mother, and for every woman, for every child to contemplate, as may be in their power, of the ways of repentance and res titution. Forgiveness or pardon is appropriate for the new morning and the New Year — and for all of time. Where once was divergence and estrangement, reconciliation and rejoicing may come, and with them, the uplifting feeling of a new opportunity and a new accomplishment. Even for those who are physically handicapped, and those who must live within the limitations of illness or age, there can be experiences that reflect the sunlight of morning. A woman, who for a time was homebound and then bedridden, marked her mornings and her days with a new interest and a new dimension. She asked her Relief Society president for the names of other women who were similarly handicapped, and there arose among them a companionship of greetings and encouragement — the exchanging of scriptural thoughts or a few brief lines of poetry. And the small world of each one became wider, for it encompassed the worlds of others. For all who have saluted the morning and the New Year with the desire and the purpose of polishing every jewel of time with spiritual strength, there will come that glow of sunrise which is part of the Lord's promise to all who have been given life upon the earth.

Voss Vice President for Public Relations MARCH OF DIMES The National Foundation The 1965 March of Dimes campaign which opens January 2 is dedicated to the fight against birth defects. Each year more than 250,000 of our children are born with serious birth defects. In numbers alone, the problem of birth defects is much greater than polio ever was. More complex, too, since birth defects have many causes and take many forms.. Even so, research can lead us toward prevention of many of these defects. Highest quality medical care can often help children already born, crippled in mind and body. The success of the work of The National Foundation March of Dimes has always depended on a partnership between the public and scientists. Scientists in many laboratories and hospitals are seeking the diverse and elusive causes of birth defects. What's more, the public is growing more concerned about this problem. One in every ten American families experiences the suffering caused by the birth of a seriously defective child. So many of these babies die. So many are disfigured or crippled for life. So many are clouded in mind. This is a tragedy. It must be stopped. You can help by giving\ to the March of Dimes to support research and treatment. FIGHT BIRTH DEFECTS — JOIN THE MARCH OF DIMES 36 Mrs. Dorothy Lewis, President of the American Mothers Committee, is sponsoring the organization of Young Mothers Councils in many cities of the United States. In Salt Lake City, Utah, in October, Mrs. Lewis declared: ''Today's mother cannot cope with her young children's discipline problems because she herself likely has had little or. No discipline shown her. Parental delinquency is at the root of this trouble. Youths need spiritual training, concepts of conformity to law — within and without the family.'' While in Salt Lake City, Mrs. Lewis called on Relief Society General President Belle S. Spafford, a close friend, and was taken on a tour of the Relief Society building. Mrs. Carma Noble, Hurricane, Utah, mother of seven children, is the leader of a remarkable beautification effort which has attracted national attention to Hurricane and has given that city of 1400 population several outstanding State awards. Mrs. Noble, in cooperation with the City Beautification Club which she organized, has supervised the planting of 450 trees, the painting of fifty houses and commercial buildings, the tearing down of 88 barns, corrals, sheds, and chicken coops, the hauling away of several dozen old car bodies, the placing of litter cans on streets, and the paving of forty blocks of streets. All but two families in Hurricane cooperated on these projects. Mrs. Jean Scott, mother of four, from Lincoln, England, administrative nead of all social work done by the Women's Voluntary Service in Lincoln, while touring the United States and visiting many welfare programs, was a guest of the General Board of Relief Society in October. She met with the First Presidency of the Church, visited Welfare Square and many production and distribution centers under Church management. Mrs. Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin, a teacher at Oxford University, England, won the 1964 Nobel Prize in chemistry. She is the first woman to receive this coveted award since Madame Marie Curie in 1911. Her contribution to science is an X-ray technique for photographing such mysteries as the molecular structure of chemicals. Cathy Ferguson, a sixteen-year-old high school girl from Burbank, California, won one of the United States' thirty-six gold medals in the Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan, in late October. Hers was for swimming in the 100-meter backstroke event, setting a world's record of one minute, seven and nine-tenths seconds. The only other American girl to win a gold medal was Lesley Bush, of Princeton, New Jersey, for her high dive. Three Russian women won gold medals and Vera Caslavaska of Czechoslovakia won three gold medals in the women's gymnastic events. 37 Wait up for me, Jenny Sara O. Moss JENNY put a change of underwear, a flannel shirt and two pairs of socks in the brown duffle bag. "T'll put this big sweater here, too, Doug. It's cold in Colorado," said Jenny. Douglas Pearson got up from the breakfast table. "It's not cold, Jenny," he teased confidently. "It's just fresh, but if it makes you feel better I'll throw this on the seat."" He picked up the sweater and duffle bag, then hesitated a moment as he looked at his wife. He drew her close and held her, almost hiding her slender frame with his strong arms, the duffle bag and sweater dangling at her back. "Tt'll be Christmas Eve when I come back, Jen, it's sure sneaked up on us this year," said Douglas. "T can't believe it's so close either, Doug." Jenny felt the rough wool of her husband's coat against her face. 'Oh, but I'm glad Mr. Smith is going to have a real Christmas this vear. You know, I just can't enjoy the holidays unless my neighbors are happy. You should see all the deliveries that have been coming to the house. Toys, food, and gifts, everything that suggests Christmas." "Kids and all for the holidays," smiled Douglas. "Vernal is not so far but what Julie Anne could 38 make the effort to get down here oftener than she does." "Yes," agreed Jenny, "'it's five years since Mrs. Smith died, and we have had Mr. Smith for Christmas every year but one. Oh, I don't mind, Doug — not a bit, but he is so thrilled that Julie Anne and her family are coming. I hope she won't disappoint her father this year." Douglas released Jenny and opened the door. The whirr of a big motor could be heard. Big Bertha had been warming up for a journey. Douglas kissed Jenny hurriedly, then rushed to the big van in the driveway and entered the cab. ''As soon as I drop this load of iron pipe at Steamboat Springs, Ill pick up a load of mattresses and start back. Tell Sharen goodbye for me, and tell her to help you." He smiled and waved, then stuck his head out the window. "Wait up for me, Jenny." Then Doug was gone. Jenny felt the loneliness throughout the house, and started her routine work and waited for Sharen to come downstairs. She felt so secure, so safe when Doug was home. The work never seemed to pile up like this. There was so much to do and Christmas was less than a week away. Finally Sharen came leisurely down the stairs. ''Good morning, Mom," she said. "Did Dad get an early start?" "Tt was past seven when he left,' said the older woman. "I hated to see him leave so: close to Christmas. It's up to you to trim the tree, dear. And then there's Amy! We'll have to get her Christmas ready, too. How are we going to get everything done?" Jenny looked at her daughter, as she ate her breakfast. Cool, lovely, and tailored looking in her girlish school clothes, Sharen ate toast and jelly and sipped her milk with apparent enjoyment. "Don't worry about everyone, Mother," said Sharon. "Christmas has a way of coming right to your door on Christmas Eve. I'll help Amy." Jenny felt relief, but with neighbors on each side of her, who needed Christmas brought to ' them, it did worry Jenny. JENNY had gone over to Amy's house soon after Sharen left for school. She found Amy struggling with a screaming infant who wanted its bottle in a hurry. Amy was white and sick looking as she tried to make the formula. "Now you: get back on the bed," said Jenny. "You can't do these things yet. I should have come over earlier."" Jenny took over, and with all the needs to be met, she was busy in the small household until afternoon. *"T'll be back over later," said Jenny as Amy lay resting on the couch. "I think you look better than I've seen you for weeks." "T couldn't help but get better with a neighbor like you, and the WAIT UP FOR ME, JENNY way you're taking care of me," said Amy. Jenny went home and met Mr. Smith coming along the driveway. He had come to borrow a wrench with which to fix a water tap. "'m almost ready for the folks," he said, a broad smile shining on his weathered face. "I have a big turkey in the icebox, six pies, and a fruit cake. I've put just about everything I could think of in the freezer, too. I hope I haven't forgotten anything." "Cranberries?" asked Jenny. Mr. Smith snapped his fingers. "I did forget cranberries," he said. ''What's turkey without cranberries?" "And candy and nuts for the children's stockings?" Jenny filled in. "Oh, I thought of that," smiled Mr. Smith. ''And did you see my wreath on the door, Mrs. Pearson?" "Tt's beautiful," said Jenny. "Simply beautiful." Jenny watched Mr. Smith hurry away. She was sure his Christmas would. Be just that — simply beautiful. ' ~ IT was early morning on the day of Christmas Eve, when Jenny heard the rustle of the curtains in her bedroom, and the whining of the wind as the branches of the bare trees lashed against the house. Storm! It always meant a hard storm when the wind blew like that from the east. She got up hastily and shut the windows. "Tt just can't storm now. It's Christmas Eve," said Jenny complainingly, as she passed Sharen's door, the fine snowflakes already dancing in the wind. "Let it snow," said Sharen 39 JANUARY 1965 sleepily. "It'll be more like Christmas. Just what we need." "A lot you know about it," said Jenny grudgingly. ""With your father out there, somewhere on the highway, trying to get home for Christmas, and Mr. Smith expecting Julie Anne and her family to make the day for him — of course I don't want it to snow." Sharen was wide awake now, with concern for her mother. "You know Big Bertha gets Dad through anything, Mom, and we can always take care of Mr. Smith on Christmas. We've done it before. But why give up already! Julie Anne's husband might just drive them through easily." Jenny didn't know why fear had suddenly engulfed her, but she had no heart for Christmas now. She busied herself with routine housework, and _ soon Sharen came down the stairs in cool confidence. Jenny ate breakfast with her, as the weather outside grew more blustery. "Let's both run over to Amy's and give her a hand with the. Housework. Ralph's been gone to work for several hours by now." Jenny shuddered. "They say the mail's real heavy this year. Poor fellow, having to buck weather like this. Sharen rose. "I love this weather," she said. 'It makes one feel so safe inside." "Young hearts," said Jenny. "I wish [ didn't have to worry about neighbors and snowstorms and Christmas, but I can't help it. Come on, let's go over to Amy's."' THE two women wrapped up in warm clothing to face the blizzard outside. It was now in full 40 force, and the snow was drifting in little piles here and there. Jenny and Sharen started out the door, when the phone rang. 'You go ahead and I'll answer the phone," Jenny said, and Sharen hurried up the road east to Amy's house. "Doug!" Jenny was overjoyed when she lifted up the receiver, to find the call was from her husband. "I've been so worried. Can you get through?" They talked on. The storm was rough. Some roads were closed. He had stopped for lunch and wanted her to know he was on the way. "T']ll make it," said Douglas confidently. 'You can count on Bertha to get through anything. But if I don't — just think of me comfortably asleep on a load of soft mattresses. "Wait up for me, Jenny. It's Christmas Eve." His last words made Jenny feel gay and light. There was no need to worry. Doug would be home. She looked around her rooms. There was beauty here and comfort. There was a quiet Christmas spirit that she could now feel. She had been too worried and busy to really see the tree that Sharen had finally found time to trim. It was beautiful, an artistic job. The lights winked at Jenny with friendliness, and the big pine cones on the mantle, with greenery, were a perfect correlation to the rest of the room. SHAREN was vacuuming the floors when Jenny entered. Amy was holding her baby, and the two small children were cutting picture books. Then the news came _ over the radio. Daniel's Canyon was closed. Road blocks were general throughout the State. Jenny burst into tears. Then Doug wouldn't get through. '"I'd counted on it so. A good Christmas for everyone. How can we ever have Christmas without your father?" Jenny looked at Sharen helplessly. ''And Mr. Smith! He was so sure that Julie Anne would come." "Mother, Dad will get through," said Sharen protectingly putting an arm around her mother. '"You'll see." Jenny wrapped herself in her coat and scarf. "I'll go and see how Mr. Smith is taking this," she said. ''He'll be so disappointed." She went to her home, leaving Sharen to stay with Amy. No sooner had she entered her house when the doorbell rang loudly. Jenny opened the door, and there stood Mr. Smith, the wind whipping about him. He looked unhappy and dejected. Jenny hurried him into the house. "T suppose you've heard! Canyon's closed," he said. "Yes," said Jenny. "The radio announced that it might be closed for several days, depending on when the storm subsides." "T've tried to call my daughter, but the wires are down up in that area where they live, and I have no way of knowing whether they started out or not." "But, Mr. Smith!" Jenny grew excited. '"There's still a possibility that your family might come. Food and things away." Jenny was sorry for her fine old neighbor. The snow beat against the windows in fierce persistence, as she tried to watch The You shouldn't give your: WAIT UP FOR ME, JENNY his bent figure going to his home. He had said he would return with a sleigh and together they would go to Amy's, taking the things that had given him so much joy in preparation for the anticipated visit of his daughter and her family. It was not long before Mr. Smith returned with a large hand sleigh stacked high with the good things that he had gathered together for Amy's Christmas. A large basket held the turkey and all the trimmings. There were pies, cookies, and various breads, packaged vegetables, and candy and nuts and popcorn balls. In a few minutes, the beauty of Christmas moved into Amy's small household. The wreath went on the door, the turkey was put in the oven to roast, the toys were done up by Sharen in gay wrappings. Amy could only look on in honest gratitude, and the children stood around in wonderment as they saw the larder filled with many good things. '"'Now for the tree,' said Mr. Smith. "I'll bring it up, but PI leave the trimming to you, Sharen." "But, Mr. Smith!" exclaimed Jenny, "you'll have to keep your tree! Why, your children would expect that more than any part of Christmas." C. Mr. Smith was determined in his purpose. "They won't be here," he said with finality. "Anyway, these children need the tree." The tree was brought, and Sharen trimmed it with the ornaments in Amy's basement. "Merry Christmas!" said Amy, with moist eyes. "Imagine what 41 JANUARY 1965 Ralph will think, coming home to — this. He'll think Santa Claus is real for sure. Mr. Smith, Jenny, and Sharen, I can't thank you enough, but when I get on my feet, I'll try. Indeed, I will.'"' Amy cried softly from sheer joy. "Now you just enjoy everything. That's all that we want," said Mr. Smith. He looked glad again. | THE three put on their coats and took their leave. They walked home in the early dusk. The wind had died, and the snow was coming straight down, the heavy flakes covering everything like a white mantle. When they got to the driveway Jenny paused. 'Now there's no object in your going to that lonely house on Christmas Eve. You come in with us, Mr. Smith, and spend the evening. "T've cooked a ham and I'll fix us some supper," she continued, as her aged neighbor smiled his acceptance. "And we'd better eat some of the pies, too," said Sharen, "if Father isn't coming for Christmas " "Stop it!" said Jenny vehemently. "Your Father has_ to come. I'm waiting up for him," she added, with firm determination. Sharen laughed. "I guess [ll wait up for him, teo, Mom," she said, as she opened the door and turned on the lights. Jenny lit the fire and settled Mr. Smith in front of it, with the newspaper, while she and Sharen bustled about in the kitchen fixing the supper on the trays: In minutes they were all 42 enjoying a festive repast in front of the crackling fire. Soon young people began to come, Sharen's friends who were out making their Christmas Eve calls. They sang and laughed and talked. Jenny was glad when they left, taking Sharen with them. Tonight, she just couldn't enter into their gaiety. She wanted to think of Douglas, and listen for the sound of the big motor, that might not come. She and Mr. Smith were left by themselves. "We might as well watch the program," said Jenny, turning on the television. ''The music is usually pretty good on Christmas Eve." Tue hours slipped by. Jenny hardly followed any of the bits on the screen. She could only think of Douglas out there in the wilderness of snow. Where was he?. When it was eleven o'clock Jenny shut off the music. "Sometimes it's just too much, Mr. Smith. Music makes me lonely," said Jenny. And suddenly she heard the sound — the familiar whirring, dinning noise of a powerful motor in the distance. She sat tense and motionless on the edge of her chair listening. "It's Doug, Mr. Smith!" cried Jenny, rushing to the window. "Tt's my husband, I know it is." She looked far up the street to the east. Now she could see the lights, casting big reflections before them. And then she saw the van, with the flashing red lights at the top of the cab. It really was Doug. He was safe at home. Jenny screamed with delight and ran outside, not minding the snow that had piled in drifts all around her. Doug was just getting out, and in a moment, Jenny was in his arms. "T knew you'd come," she said. "Oh, I just knew it."" Her voice trailed off, as she saw people getting out of the cab. A man and a woman emerged from _ the shadows. "Julie Anne," said Jenny. "You got here for Christmas! Mr. Smith, oh, Mr. Smith, they're here!" Mik. Smith had come to the door. Now he had the full impact of the excitement. And her husband were coming toward him. "T'll get that rear door open," said Douglas. "I'll bet these kids are sound asleep on the mattresses." One by one the four children tumbled out from the back end of the van. "Well, this is great," said Mr. Smith, as his grandchildren came toward him. "You mean you're all here?" "Indeed we are," said Julie Anne, as she hugged her father, and the children gathered around sleepy-eyed. "And here's your Christmas tree," said Douglas, setting a fully trimmed tree before them in a snowdrift. "We brought everything," laughed Julie Anne. 'Turkey, food, gifts, and things for Santa Claus for the little ones. Doug said there was still lots of room in the van, so why not the Christmas tree?" Julie Anne | WAIT UP FOR ME, JENNY "And lucky you did," said Mr. Smith, with a wink at Jenny. The little procession began, led by Mr. Smith to his own house. Everyone carried something — baskets, suitcases, and carton boxes loaded with things for a happy holiday. Julie Anne's husband carried the tree. Soon they were all on the threshold of the big, old house. "Merry Christmas," they all called." "Merry Christmas!" returned Doug and Jenny. 'We'll see you tomorrow." "How did you ever strike it so lucky?" asked Jenny, as she and Doug went into the house. "I had no idea that you really would bring them." "After you suggested over the phone that I stop and see them, I did, and I gave them ten minutes to get loaded into the van. Julie Anne really wanted to come, and you should have seen them scramble. We got into the canyon just before it was closed for travel." "It was certainly thoughtful of you to bring the tree," laughed Jenny. "Well, it's like Sharen said, just after you left, and there was so much uncertainty about getting everything done for Christmas, 'Christmas has a way, Mom, of coming right to your door when the big day comes,' and it has."" Jenny smiled up at Doug. "And here comes Sharen." Jenny could hear the cars in the driveway. Douglas stretched his long arms, then closed them around Jenny. "I'm glad you waited up for me," he said affectionately. "Merry Christmas." 43 - ie * Pa re POSH F ev ge ey Laura L.

At the Station she is bade goodbye by her mother and younger sister, Maria, as well as by Karl Ernst, a Church member who has recently come from Munich. In Salt Lake City, Elsa is met by the parents of Clay Knowlton, a member of the United States Armed Forces stationed in Heidelberg, who are sponsoring her. TuHE Knowltons drove through the downtown - Streets to give Elsa her first view of the city, and then out to their home in the southeast. The mountains seemed so close it looked as if she could almost reach out and _ touch them. They also looked extremely high and rugged. At the house she was welcomed by fourteen-year-old Jean, and Burt, just turned seventeen. They were full of questions about their brother, whom they had not seen Mabel Harmer now for more than a year. Elsa had the feeling that they thought _ there was something more serious between her and Clay than was actually the case. She wished that she knew just what to do about it, but decided she couldn't very well say, "Now, look here. J am not engaged to marry your brother. I probably never shal] be." Burt at once constituted himself her escort and stand-in for his absent brother, "There's a dance in the ward tonight," he said. "Wouldn't you like to go?" "Thank you very much," she said, "but, after riding on a bus for three nights I can't think of a more inviting place to go than to bed." "I guess you're right," he agreed. 'Well, there'l] be others. I told Clay that I'd look 45 JANUARY 1965 after you. Anyway, tomorrow is Saturday and no school, so we can go someplace. Do you like football?" "T don't know. What is it?" "Boy! Didn't you ever see a football game? That will be the ticket!" It was indeed the '"'ticket'' as far as Elsa was concerned. The cheering and wild enthusiasm from both sides of the stadium were something she never could have imagined. Burt tried to explain something of the intricacies of the game, but without too much success. She had no difficulty, however, in mastering a "hot dog' and, on the whole, found the afternoon highly exciting and enjoyable. That evening Barbara Wilkins, from next door, came over to get acquainted. When they talked about Clay, Elsa couldn't help but notice the girl's heightened color and interest. She wondered how much, if anything, there was between them. Clay had never mentioned a girl back home who meant anything special to him, but that didn't mean _ there couldn't be one. THE next day Elsa went with the Knowltons to church. What a difference there was in the several hundred people in this ward and the few dozen at home! Everyone was very cordial, however, and made her most welcome. On the whole, she decided that she rather enjoyed the larger crowd. She was very anxious to find work and wanted to start looking on Monday morning. Mrs. Knowlton tried to persuade her to wait for a few days and get 46 acquainted with the city, but Elsa replied, ""No, I may get homesick if I don't get busy. And that will never do at this distance. The only way I could get back now would be by walking and swimming." Since her only experience had been as a saleswoman, she went to several downtown stores and registered. The only encouragement she could get was for work after Thanksgiving, when the holiday buying would begin, and that might be only temporary. Thanksgiving was a whole month away. She simply had to find something to do before then. She couldn't impose upon the hospitality of the Knowltons much longer, although they were doing everything in their power to make her feel welcome. She knew that she could go up to her uncle's home in Idaho and, indeed, there was already an invitation to spend Thanksgiving with them, but she wanted very much to stay in Salt Lake City. "And I _ will," she resolved. "There is certainly something I can do." It was not long before she began to suspect that there was something more to Burt's constant offers of escort than an order from Clay to "look after you." She knew, as any girl would, without undue _ vanity, that she was very pretty — had often been called beautiful. She knew, also, that a seventeen-yearold youth could be very impressionable, and it gave her additional reason for wanting to move away. She decided that, if nothing else showed up, she would have to take housework. It was the last thing she wanted, since she would have to be so much alone and not be able to make the contacts she had hoped for. But it might have to do for a while, anyway. She decided not to go to any more games or even to MIA with Burt, unless others of the family were along. Several times he had said, "As soon as there is enough snow in the mountains I'm going to take you skiing." "But, I can't! I've never been on a pair of skis in my life," Elsa protested. "So what? Did you think the rest of us were born wearing them? There's really nothing to it. You work on the bunny slopes for a few times and then zoom! You ride the ski lift up the mountainside and come zipping down." "Unless you catch your ski on a loose root, or hit a big rock," said Jean. "Then you zip right headfirst into six feet of snow. But it's worth it. Unless you break a leg, of course. Lots of people do. I never have." "I'm sure it must be worth the risk," Elsa agreed. "Sometime when I feel that I can take a few weeks off to nurture a broken limb I'll give it a try." "You can't wait that long," said Burt, "fon account of that time never comes. You have to dare and do. Anyway, no one breaks legs any more — much." HIE was so insistent that she decided to go, thinking that Jean would also be along. It turned out, however, that she would have to use Jean's togs and skis. "Oh, I wouldn't think of doing that!" she exclaimed. 'That TURN OF THE WHEEL would mean that you have to give up your own day." "T didn't plan to go anyway," Jean replied. "I have a roller skating party on. You go ahead. You'll love it." "Providing I don't come back in an ambulance," said Elsa. They went in a station wagon with four other young people, and it did seem the start of an exciting day. Even though the others were all high school friends of Burt's, they were fun to be with. She was amazed at how quickly they reached the ski area at Brighton and how many hundreds of people were there. They seemed to be of all ages, ranging from tots of six or seven to their grandparents. Burt parked the car and they all proceeded to put on their skis. He helped put on hers and then took her over to the practice slopes where the beginners were learning to stay upright on the "boards." The rest of their party quickly got in line for the ski lift. "You must join them, too," she said to Burt. "I'm not going to ruin your day. Besides, I don't want you around when I fall down." "T'll come in mighty handy to get you upright again," he retorted. 'Especially if your skis come off and you can't put them back on." He helped her a few times and she was surprised at how much she enjoyed it and how quickly she mastered the art of staying upright. She finally persuaded Burt to join the others at the ski lift and kept on practicing by herself. At noon they went into the — lodge for a lunch of chili, buns, and hot cocoa. It was great fun, 47 JANUARY 1965 and she was more than glad that she had come. She rested for awhile after lunch and then went back to her practice slopes. She longed to join the others, as she watched them gliding so effortlessly down the mountainsides, but she knew that it would take a lot more practice before she could tackle anything like that. Burt came back again to help her, and just before it was time to leave, he said, "I think that you ought to go up on the ski lift just for the ride. The scenery is out of this world." "Tt is most certainly up from this world at any rate,' she agreed. They went over to the platform, and she was fastened into one of the slowly moving chairs. It was exciting indeed to ride up above the snow-laden trees and to look over the rooftops of the lodges and cabins.: AT THE top of the lift she was swung out again by an attendant. Burt was in the chair just behind and he took her over to the edge of the platform to show her the lake and dam below. "This is Twin Lakes," he said, "only it's all one. Maybe the twin is over on the other side of the mountain, or something." "It must be beautiful up here in the summertime," she said. "It sure is. You'll see. We come up here for picnics and outings all the time. It's nice and cool." "Tt's nice and cold right now. Maybe we'd better go back down." They walked back to the ski lift, and to Elsa's consternation 48 saw that it had stopped running. "Golly, I didn't know it was that late," said Burt. 'Well, it's a good thing you've had all that practice. On account of you're going to go down on top of the snow instead of over it." "Isn't there a chance that we can get them to run it up here just once again?" "None in the world. They know that somebody would keep them going all night if they came back at every call. Come on. We'll make it all right. I'll help you." As she looked down the steep slopes, Elsa was a long way from sharing his confidence. She would have given a great deal to be safely at the bottom again. "Look," said Burt, ''you keep your skis on the inside, and I['ll put mine on the outside. We'll go down together. I'll hold on tight to you. If we take a spill, don't worry. We'll just get up again and keep going. You'll be surprised how fast we'll get down." It was fast, all right — and something of a nightmare. Her surprise was in getting down safely at all. The others were watching with interest. "Quite a stunt," said Mike. "I reckon you'll be ski jumping next Saturday." "T reckon I'll be home in a rocking chair knitting an afghan next Saturday," said Elsa. "I'm so grateful to have come through this with my limbs intact, that I won't tempt fate again in a hurry." "Nonsense," scoffed Burt. "There wasn't a thing to it. All you need is to be guided by a big strong man like myself." What we both need is to get going on separate paths in a hurry, thought Elsa. She couldn't help wondering how much of this had been accidental. At any rate she wouldn't put herself in line to share any more adventures with this youngster. Sue was greatly relieved on Monday to get a call from one of the large department stores to report for work. It was in the gift department, and she felt very much at home among her beloved Hummel and _ Hutschenreuther figurines again. She touched some of them lovingly and would talk them up to every customer. "How is it that all your sales are for the German figurines?" asked the department head in some amusement. "Because I know them — and love them," Elsa replied. '"Anyway, I did sell one Royal Doulton yesterday. The lady has a collection and claims that she buys nothing else. Isn't that a pity?" Her next move was to find an apartment. She studied the ads in the newspapers, and when there was one listing a vacancy for a Latter-day Saint girl, she applied at once. It was to share an apartment with three other girls, and this suited her perfectly. They were all working girls, June a schoolteacher, and the other two — Margery and Elizabeth, in offices. The schedule was worked out very carefully as to which tasks each girl would do in any given week and adhered to so strictly that one was not even allowed to take over the dishwashing, except in a case of emergency. TURN OF THE WHEEL The only problem seemed to be closet space, since Margery was an inveterate seamstress who was always bringing home pieces of material that had caught her fancy. She had more than her share of the somewhat limited closet space and even had dresses hanging in cellophane bags in the kitchen storage closet. "Tt could be worse," said Elizabeth philosophically. "She could be a fancier of white rats — as my little brother is — or play jazz records all evening, as the girl did whose place you took."' "Or even borrow our clothes and cosmetics as my landlady did before I came here," added June. Esa went to church with them on Sunday and again found herself in a large congregation. She was warmly received, but felt that she could very easily be lost in the crowd. "Do any of you have a position in the ward?" she asked. "June teaches a class in the Junior Sunday School, and Margery and I sing in the choir," Elizabeth replied. "I guess that most of the jobs go to the members who have lived here rather permanently. The working girls, such as we are, come and go too frequently for them to pay much attenticn to us, I suppose. However, we are always welcome in the choir — or so I have found." Elsa joined them, since she was eager to be part of some organization and music was her first love anyway. One day she asked the director if it would be possible for her to practice occasionally on the organ. "TI played for our branch at home," she explained, "but I haven't played an 4" JANUARY 1965 organ as large as this. Would it be all right for me to try?" "Ves, indeed," was the reply. "Come an hour before choir practice, if you wish. I'll arrange for the caretaker to let you have the use of it." Elsa went to work with great pleasure and enthusiasm. She soon learned the use of the foot pedals and practiced first on the Church hymns and then on other music. Early in December they began rehearsing for a Christmas cantata. There were extra practices, in addition to the regular choir rehearsals. One evening the choir director asked, "Sister Jennings has gone away for a couple of weeks. Do you want to try and take over?" "T should like it very much," Elsa replied. "TI'll practice on the music every chance I get this week." She worked hard and soon had the music mastered well enough to satisfy the director. That, with the extra holiday buying at the store, kept her busy enough to forget all about the homesickness she had been dreading. Elsa had frequent letters from both Clay and Karl, besides weekly ones from her mother and sister, of course. Once in a while Clay's and Karl's letters would come at the same time, and it was always a problem to decide which one to open first. She solved it by shutting her eyes, turning the letters several times, and then reading the one that came out on top. "Tf you don't know which one you like best any more than that," said June, "it means that you don't love either one of them." "T haven't said that I did," agreed Elsa. "Then what about them? Which one is in love with you?" "So far neither one has offered me anything more than friendship." "Oh, dear, what a_ waste!" sighed June. "And here I was. Hoping to help solve an insoluable triangle. Anyway, I can still hope, can't I?" "Most assuredly. Along with myself, perhaps," smiled Elsa. On the last practice before presenting the Christmas cantata, Sister Jennings returned and took over as organist again. Elsa couldn't help being disappointed, but she realized that it was only fair. Last year she had played the organ for the program at home. This had been her own choice. She could have been playing the organ at home instead.

Pitt, President; Cleo Eileen Hedrick, First Counselor. Laura C. Horne, President, Texas Mission Relief Society, reports: '"Machine-sewed, quilted pictures, with beautiful three-dimensional detail, became the center point of a well-organized and well-displayed bazaar, presented to the public in the main business district of Odessa. For some two months the interest of the public was drawn to the coming bazaar by the outstanding quality of these exceptional, hand-rubbed, and framed pictures. Made to fit the decor of all periods of fine furnishings, pictures sold as high as $139.95. They were displayed with recognition on television stations, in leading banks, stores of fine furnishings, and plainly stamped: 'Made by Odessa L. D. S. Relief Society.' This created a fine point for an opening discussion of missionary work, while sales mounted to better than $3,000. With the true spirit of missionary work, printed instructions were distributed to all branches of the Texas Mission. One of the pictures proudly hangs in the newly built and dedicated mission home at Dallas, Texas. 51 JANUARY 1965 Swedish Mission Relief Society Receives a Visit From a General Board Member for the First Time, April 25-27, 1964 Seated, front row, left to right: Agness Carlstrem, translator; Britta Rydstrem, Secretary, Swedish Mission Primary Association; La Vern W. Parmley, President, Primary Association; Aleine M. Young, member, General Board of Relief Society; Marianne Tenstrem, President, Swedish Mission Relief Society; Jean W. Fletcher, Supervisor, Swedish Mission Relief Society. The other sisters in the picture are members of the Relief Society and Primary presidencies of the five districts of the Swedish Mission. Sister Tenstrem reports that a dinner party was held in Stockholm on April 25, 1964, for all the mission district leaders, at which time Sister Young and Sister Parmley were honored, and gifts were presented to them. For the occasion, Eva Gerling, Eva Myrberg, and Bergit Pearson were dressed in Swedish national costumes. On March 17, 1964, the Stockholm First Branch presented a skit called "Sixty Years Ago," and representing the time when the chapel in Stockholm was dedicated by President Heber J. Grant. Irma Hodell, President, Stockholm First Branch Relief Society, wrote the skit, which presented the sisters hard at work preparing for the great day of the chapel dedication. Greda Andersson, Ethel Ramsden, and Inez Perciwall, also participated as characters in the skit. As a child, Sister Perciwall, accompanied her mother to the chapel dedication sixty years ago. Ammon Stake (Idaho), Idaho Falls Twenty-Sixth Ward Nursery Pictured assisting the children are Kay Zorn and Jean Smith. Emma Jane Nelson, President, Ammon Stake Relief Society, reports: "The sisters of the Twenty-sixth Ward have placed special emphasis on making their Relief Society nursery an ideal place for the children of their ward. Their nursery is, indeed, one of the most outstanding in our stake. Note the clever aprons worn by each child. Sister Smith is now the president of this ward, although this article and picture were submitted by Harriett Kerr, the former president. Sister Kerr, in explaining some of the elements of the successful nursery in her ward, stated: 'We begin by selecting gentle baby sitters who will assure our younger groups that mother will be right back, and who will quietly usher our older groups into the Junior Sunday School room, where they will happily encounter flannel board stories and well-known songs. After this comes activity time. The picture shows one such period in which our children were busy and intent upon pasting popcorn on a bare, pre-arranged apricot tree. As the children come to meet their mothers at the conclusion of Relief Society, they are smiling, and we feel that everyone leaves with a spirit of fulfillment. One little girl comes alone because she hasn't yet convinced Mother it is a wonderful place to be.'" San Joaquin Stake (California) Singing Mothers Present Two Concerts Modesto, May 2, 1964, and Stockton, June 5, 1964 Leona B. Hansen, former president, Modesto Stake Relief Society, reports: "Sixty-five sisters spent many hours the past six months preparing for our Singing Mothers concerts. We placed special emphasis on inviting our nonmember friends, and the two evenings brought over 400 people to enjoy the evenings of music. Sister Francelle Larsen conducted, with Janet Odum at the piano, and Karlyn Brett at the organ. As one sister expressed her feelings, 'I have never felt closer to my Father in heaven.' Indeed, it was a spiritual feast." The new President of San Joaquin Stake Relief Society is Leona Brown Hansen. 52 4 Pearl Harbor Stake (Hawaii) Singing Mothers Present Music For Relief Society Conference in New Stake House May 10, 1964 Fern Pule, chorister, is seated first on the right in the front row; Leiamalama Sniffen, organist, sixth from the right in the front row; Barbara Chlarson, former first counselor, fifth from the right in the front row; standing at the left, second row: Evelyn Miyamoto, First Counselor; Dawn Mangum, Second Counselor; inset, Virginia Harbertson, President. Sister Harbertson reports: "These dear sisters outdid themselves in the effort they put forth in preparing the music for this conference. It was sung as only the Hawaiian sisters can sing. They truly carried the message to 'Lift Thine Eyes,' and renewed the promise 'If Ye Love Me, Keep My Commandments.' It was truly a wonderful experience, for they found that they could learn the music when they felt that they could not. We were all touched very deeply, knowing that the Lord will always be ready to help us." Uruguayan Mission, Capital District, Rodo South Branch Relief Society Conducts Successful Bazaar The photograph shows a booth decorated with flowers, and displaying foods and handicraft. At the left, back of the sisters, a number of originally designed potholders, aprons, dresses, and other well-made and _ attractive articles are displayed. In nearly all the branches of this mission two bazaars are held each year. One is held during the winter, with emphasis being placed on knitted articles. Another bazaar is held during the summer. An outstanding activity of the Relief Societies of the Uruguayan Mission is cooperation with the construction program. When a missionary is called, the Relief Society provides him with clothing for his mission. The sisters also cook and sew for the construction missionaries, and hold special fiestas in order to raise funds for the program. The sisters are realizing their responsibility in encouraging the Priesthood to magnify their callings and are giving great encouragement to the fulfillment of the calling of a Church builder. They are also meeting the request of President David O. McKay that every member be a missionary. They have a fellowshipping program in which they try to help new members, reactivated members, and nonmembers, who are made to feel welcome in the Relief Society and in other Church organizations and activities. Carmen C. De Galli is president of the Uruguayan Mission Relief Society, and Eva B. Barton is supervisor. Hawaiian Mission Relief Society Leadership Convention Kahului, Maui, August 28-29, 1964 Seated, center front, left to right: Elder George W. Poulsen, Jr., President, Hawaiian Mission; Orlene J. Poulsen, Supervisor, Hawaii Mission Relief Society; Chiyo Meyers, President; Ethel Young, Education Counselor; Haruko Kiilau, Work Director Counselor; Pearl Mahi, Secretary. Sister Poulsen reports: "Sixty Relief Society women from four districts and twenty-three branches were in attendance at the convention. The sisters were told of the importance of their responsibilities, not only as Relief Society leaders, but as wives and mothers. Ideas for the nursery program, which is being introduced into the Hawaii Mission Relief Society, were presented, and discussions and demonstrations on the lesson material for the coming year were given. Bazaar items and samples of handwork were on display by the four districts, and the women were taught Lauhala weaving and rug making, while others learned how to cook some new dishes which were demonstrated. "In the evening, a delightful play, which emphasized the importance of active Relief Society membership, was presented by the Hawaii District Relief Society. Mary Soon, who had been released as mission work director counselor, was honored." 54 South German Mission Relief Society Convention July 10-11, 1964 Center, front row, standing, left to right: Genevieve S. Gardner, Supervisor; Margarete Opperman, President; to the left of Sister Gardner: Ursula Hubner, Counselor in district presidency; seated, second from the left, in the front row: Dorothea Mez, District President. Sister Gardner reports: "The two-day convention covered every phase of Relief Society. Excellent leadership sessions were held, giving help in every department. Effective charts and posters were on display, which encouraged better preparation and more effective teaching in each department. One morning was devoted to the responsibility of the Latter-day Saint wife in her home. The work meeting session featured quilting, which was new and interesting to everyone. Arts and crafts were taught, which included painting and ceramics, reed work, and the making of jewelry from silver and copper wire. Every sister took home some new and useful ideas. "Music was an important part of the convention. The highlight of the first day was an evening of music. Only Relief Society sisters participated on the program, but the house was filled to overflowing with branch members, Church building and full-time missionaries, and friends. A delightful play 'The Water Cure' was presented by members of the Freiburg Branch. Other highlights were films, "The Awakening,' and the Tabernacle Choir film 'With Music Ring.' Six sisters were honored for over twenty-five years in Relief Society, and were presented with a book."

Sister Schipaanboord reports: This year at our spring social we honored women, telling in the program and showing by display, their accomplishments and contributions in the building of the West and the making of our cultural life of today. 'First Ladies,' or representatives of First Ladies, were our guests of the day. Margaret Lee, First Lady of cur city reviewed the lives of six outstanding pioneer women. Anne Gledhill represented the General Board of Relief Society, and brought a message from the Board. Ann Hafen, President of the Utah Poetry Society, represented first ladies of literature and read some of her own poems. Margaret Black, First Lady of our stake, and Jane Schipaanboord, First Lady of Liberty Stake Relief Society, were also honored. A lovely musical program was rendered. The Liberty Stake recreation center was transformed into a spring garden under the able hands of Sister Giauque. Beautiful handmade quilts from nine wards and two branches were on display, and refreshments were served." 56 a THEOLOGY The Doctrine and Covenants Elder Roy W. Doxey Lesson 63 — The One Mighty and Strong (Text: Doctrine and Covenants, Section 85) For First Meeting, April 1965 Objective: To recognize the importance of adhering to the revelations of the Lord and how claim to office may be tested. INTRODUCTION By commandment, William W. Phelps was promised certain bles- 'sings afier his baptism. (Section 55.) At this early period (June 1831), he was given the assignment to travel with the Prophet Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon to Independence, Missouri, where he was to engage in the printing business. (Verses 4-5.) At the time the Prophet wrote to him (November 27, 1832) about conditions in Missouri, he was editor and printer of the Evening and Morning Star, the first periodical published by the Church. Brother Phelps was also an assistant to Bishop Edward Partridge. In reply to a letter from him, the Prophet, already concerned about the welfare of the saints in Missouri, gave instructions regarding the 58 allotting of inheritances to the saints. Matters of great weight rested upon the Prophet's mind and by inspiration he sensed the feelings of Brother Phelps in these words:... My God, great and mighty art Thou, therefore show unto Thy servant what shall become of those who are essaying to come up unto Zion, in order to keep the commandments of God, and yet receive not their inheritance by consecrations, by order of deed from the Bishop, the man that God has appointed in a legal way, agreeably to the law given to organize and regulate the Church, and all the affairs of the same (DHC I:298). Then, revealing the source of his own feelings toward Brother Phelps, the Prophet wrote: Brother William, in the love of God, having the most implicit confidence in you as a man of God, having obtained this confidence by a vision of heaven, | his therefore I will proceed to unfold to you some of the feelings of my heart, and to answer the question (Jbid.). LETTERS AS REVELATIONS From this letter of November 27, 1832, we have received Section 85 of the Doctrine and Covenants. (DHC 1:298-299.) Historically, there are many examples of letters becoming scripture as the writer was inspired to pen words of admonition, encouragement, and commandment. The apostle Paul indicated that his knowledge of the gospel of Jesus Christ was received not from men but from the Lord, the Giver of revelation. (Galatians 1:11-12.) Christian scripture consists of many letters written to branches of the Church and to individuals during the New Testament period. (Romans, Corinthians, Galatians, Colossians, Timothy, etc.) The apostles Peter and John have also contributed scripture in the form of letters. In The Book of Mormon we have the letter of Mormon to his son Moroni that explains the doctrine of the atonement as it relates to little children. (Moroni 8.) Subsequent sections in the Doctrine and Covenants also come from letters. (Sections 121, 122, 123, 127, 128.) CHURCH RECORD TO BE KEPT Important instructions were given to the '"Lord's clerk' in _ Zion (Missouri) regarding the keeping of a faithful record. Under the law of consecration the - steward was required to manage inheritance (stewardship), not only for his own welfare but also for the general purposes of the Church. Records were to be LESSON DEPARTMENT kept of those who consecrated their property and of the stewardships received. (D&C 85:1.) The following verse of the revelation describes somewhat the nature of some of our records of today: "And also their manner of life, their faith, and works. " In that day those who came to Zion and did not consecrate, and, consequently, did not receive an inheritance, were considered unfaithful to their covenants. A penalty for these and also those who had apostatized after receiving their inheritance was not to have their names enrolled with the faithful. (Verses 2-3.) BOOK OF LIFE An accurate record of acts is maintained in the heavens comparable with the recordings made in the "'book of the law of God" (see D&C 85:1-5) kept by the Lord's clerk on the earth. In a later revelation, the Lord emphasized the necessity for keeping accurate records that there might be agreement with the "book of life' which is kept in heaven. ([bid., 128:7.) In the New Testament period, John the Revelator explained that all things shall be inherited by the faithful, while the disobedient shall not enter into the abode of God. And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a, lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life (Revelation 21:27). The Lamb's book of life is the book of life kept in the heavens. PRESENT APPLICATION In 1832 and as long as the law of consecration was in force, the 59 JANUARY 1965 Lord intended that his saints would prepare themselves against the day of burning when the Savior would come in flaming fire taking vengeance upon those who were not keeping his commandments. (D&C 85:3; II Thessalonians 1:7-8.) This message is similar to the promise that the same judgment would come to those who would not tithe: Behold, now it is called today until the coming of the Son of Man, and verily it is a day of sacrifice, and a day for the tithing of my people; for he that is tithed shall not be burned at his coming. For after today cometh the burning — this is speaking after the manner of the Lord — for verily I say, tomorrow all the proud and they that do wickedly shall be as stubble; and I will burn them up, for I am the Lord of Hosts; and I will not spare any that remain in Babylon. Wherefore, if ye believe me, ye will labor while it is called today (D&C 64: 23-25). It is apparent from the discussion about the book of life and its purpose, that the inheritance of the saints in the future life will be determined by their faithfulness. In the annual conference of 1900, speakers mentioned this subject and also applied Section 85 to conditions as they are now. The law of consecration in force in 1832 is not required of the saints today, but every member of the Church is under obligation to keep the commandments, among which is the law of tithing. By commandment, a faithful record is kept of the non-tithe payers as well as of those who pay tithing. In the language of Elder Rudger Clawson:..'. The lines are being drawn. It must be known to the authorities of 60 this Church and to the people who are faithful and who are not faithful. God requires it and it must be recorded, for the reason plainly set forth in the revelation, that those whose names are not found recorded in the book of the law of God shall have no inheritance in Zion in that day when our eternal inheritance shall be divided out to us (Conference Report, April 1900, page 44). "THE STILL SMALL VOICE" There are various means by which the Lord communicates with his children and, especially, the prophets. In the Doctrine and Covenants there are many forms of revelation noted: for example, the visitation of heavenly beings, Section 27; by vision, as Section 76; the use of the Urim and Thummim, as Sections 3, 6, 7, 11; inspiration, Sections 8, 20 and 21, and other ways. We come now to another method of revelation — the Lord speaking into the mind. An example is Enos, who, while struggling in the spirit said: ''behold, the voice of the Lord came into my mind again." (B. Of M., Enos 10). Jeremiah experienced revelation in this same way. (Jeremiah 1:4, 11, 13.) One of the notable experiences of the Prophet Joseph Smith in receiving revelation is found in Section 85, as follows: Yea, thus saith the still small voice, which whispereth through and _pierceth all things, and often times it maketh my bones to quake while it maketh manifest (Verse 6). Nephi, in calling his wayward brothers to repentance, reminded them of the times when an angel "hath spoken unto you in a still small voice, but ye were past feeling, that ye could not feel his words" (I Nephi 17:45). Every member of the Church is entitled to receive divine guidance in the daily affairs of his life, as well as in his Church positions. President Heber J. Grant once said: The Lord gives to many of us the still, small voice of revelation. It comes as vividly and_ strongly as though it were with a great sound. It comes to each man, according to his needs and faithfulness, for guidance in matters that pertain to his own life. For the Church as a whole it comes to those who have been ordained to speak for the Church as a whole (Conference Report, April 1945, page 9). Very early in the dispensation, the Lord revealed that there was only one person at a time who has the right and power to receive revelation for the Church (D&C 28:2-7; 43:2-4, Lesson 18, Relief Society Magazine, August 1959.) INTERPRETATION Verses 7 and 8 of Section 85 were given by the Lord about Bishop Edward Partridge and his calling in regulating the Church in Missouri, with special reference to the law of consecration. Because of a misunderstanding of - this revelation, President Joseph F. Smith and his counselors, John R. Winder and Anthon H. Lund, wrote upon this subject for the benefit of the believer. In their preface to their interpretation, they wrote: Perhaps no other passage in the revelations of the Lord, in this dispensation, has given greater rise to so much speculation as this one. [D&C 85:6-8.] Also, it has been used by vain and foolish men to bolster up their vagaries of speculation, and in some cases their pretensions to great _the "one mighty and _ strong," LESSON DEPARTMENT power and nigh positions they were to attain in the Church. One would think in such a matter as this that sufficient native modesty would assert itself to restrain a man from announcing himself as the one upon whom such high honors are to be conferred, and who is to exercise such great powers in establishing the Saints in their inheritances; and that even if one suspected, for any reason, that such a position, and such exceptional powers were to be conferred upon him, he would wait until the Lord would clearly indicate to the Church, as well as to himself, that he has been indeed sent of God to the work of so noble a ministry, as is described in the passage under question. Those, however, who have so far proclaimed themselves as_ being have manifested the utmost ignorance of the things of God and the order of the Church. Indeed their insufferable ignorance and egotism have been at the bottom of all their pretensions, and the cause of all the trouble into which they have fallen. They seem not to have been aware of the fact that the Church of Christ and of the Saints is completely organized, and that when the man who shall be called upon to divide unto the Saints their inheritances comes, he will be designated by the inspiration of the Lord to the proper authorities of the Church, appointed and sustained according to the order provided for the government of the Church (/mprovement Era, 10:929-930, October 1907). These are the verses that concern us in this lesson: And it shall come to pass that I, the Lord God, will send one mighty and strong, holding the scepter of power in his hand, clothed with light for a covering, whose mouth shall utter words, eternal words; while his bowels shall be a fountain of truth, to set in order the house of God, and to arrange by lot the inheritances of the saints whose names are found, and the names of their fathers, and of 61 JANUARY 1965 their children, enrolled in the book of the law of God; While that man, who was called of God and appointed, that putteth forth his hand to steady the ark of God, shall fall by the shaft of death, like as a tree that is smitten by the vivid shaft of lightning (D&C 85:7-8). In their explanation of these verses, the First Presidency set forth these ideas: 1. Conditions of jealousy, pride, unbelief, and hardness of heart prevailed among the brethren in Missouri. (Ibid., 84:54-58, 76.) Bishop Edward Partridge was a party to this condition, resulting in the foregoing revelation being received. 2. Bishop Partridge and most of the saints in Missouri partially repented, although in March 1833, the Lord declared that he was not well pleased with the bishop. Eight years later he died due to. Persecution in Missouri, forgiven of the Lord. Who shall say that his repentance, his sacrifices, his sufferings and faithfulness did not procure for him a mitigation of the severe judgment decreed against him in the revelation contained in the eighty-fifth section of the Doctrine and Covenants? At any rate, the Lord said, some three years later, that he was well pleased with Bishop Partridge (Improvement Era 10:938-939; see also DHC Ii: 302-303). 3. Bishop Partridge was the man referred to in the revelation who should fall by the shaft of death, if he did not repent. (D&C 85:8.) 4. If Bishop Partridge had not repented, the Lord would have appointed "one mighty and strong" to take his place; therefore, the First Presidency considered "'the whole incident of the 62 prophecy closed" (Improvement Era 10:940). BISHOP EDWARD PARTRIDGE Bishop Edward Partridge was called to the bishopric February 4, 1831 (D&C 41:9), and at that time the Lord referred to him as "like unto Nathanael of old." Before this, he was a member of the Campbellites and joined the Church in December 1830. During the severe persecution of the saints in Missouri, due partly to their failure to keep the commandments of the Lord, he "'acted a most noble, and self-sacrificing part, and bore many indignities with the greatest patience." Partly stripped of his clothing, the bishop was taken to the public square in Independence, Missourl, because he would not denounce The Book of Mormon and he was tarred and feathered, as the mob jeered. Later, he with five others, offered themselves as ransom for the Church even to be scourged and put to death, if that would stop the inhuman cruelties heaped upon the saints by the Missourians. Later, he assisted the saints in their drivings from Missouri, and assisted in their location in Illinois. On May 27, 1840, Bishop Partridge died in Nauvoo, accepted of the Lord. AN ALTERNATIVE From this revelation, there is no escape from the definite word of the Lord on how his servants are to be appointed. President Joseph F. Smith and his Counselors drew attention to the important truth that if there was ever a need for the "one mighty and strong" he would have to occupy the same position as Bishop Part- ridge — the Presiding Bishop. It would be that bishop's duty in the future, under the law of consecration, to "arrange by lot the inheritances of the Saints." (D&C 57:7, 15; 58:14, 17; 85:7.) Furthermore, that bishop would have to be called in the Lord's way, and not as men might wish to make their own rules. The order of calling Priesthood officers was established early in the dispensation. With the restoration of the Priesthood, it was stated that authority is necessary to call men into the Lord's service. Before this, Hyrum Smith was told that he was not to preach the gospel until he had been called. (Jbid., 11:15.) In the revelation on organizing the Church, Priesthood officers were to be appointed and ordained. (Ibid., 20:2-3, 38-39, 60.) Moreover, they were to be approved by a vote of the Church in appointed meetings. Verses 61-65.) These steps are necessary to receive the approval of the Lord: (1) a call by revelation or authority; (2) approval of the members of the Church; and (3) an ordination by one who has the authority. These steps were indicated later, as noted above, to validate the call of the President of the Church. (Jbid., 28:2-7; 43-2-4.) The Presiding Bishop as all officers in the Church, is no exception, as witness the instruction concerning the appointment of Bishop Edward Partridge: And again, I have called my servant Edward Partridge; and I give a commandment, that he should be appointed by the voice of the church, and ordained a bishop unto the church, to leave his merchandise and to spend all his time in the labors of the church; LESSON DEPARTMENT To see to all things as it shall be appointed unto him in my laws in the day that I shall give them (Jbid., 41:9-10). [Italics by writer. ] Future bishops unto the Church will receive their appointment in the same manner. The Lord declares that there can be no exception. Pretenders to Church office or to the rights and privileges of the Church have arisen and _ will probably continue to arise occasionally; therefore, it behooves Latter-day Saints to be aware of the foregoing keys against deception. In concluding their message on this revelation (Section 85), President Joseph F. Smith and his Counselors wrote in 1907:... We would say that the Latterday Saints by this time, should be so well settled in the conviction that God has established his Church in the earth for the last time, to remain, and no more to be thrown down, or destroyed; and that God's house is a house of order, of law, of regularity, that erratic disturbers of that order of men ought not to have any influence with them, nor ought the Saints to be disturbed in their spirit by such characters and their theories. The Church of Christ is with the Saints. It has committed to it the law of God — for its own government and perpetuation. It possesses every means for the correction of every wrong or abuse or error which may from time to time arise, and that without anarchy, or even revolution; it can do it by process of evolution — by development, by an increase of knowledge, wisdom, patience and charity (Improvement Era 10:942). NO INHERITANCES FOR SOME The remaining verses of Section 85 reaffirm, with emphasis, that the unfaithful members of the Church not having their names recorded in the book of the law will not obtain an inheri- 63 JANUARY 1965 tance, but their lot will be found among the unbelievers where there are wailing and gnashing of teeth. (Verses 9-11.) The consequences of disobedience are serious indeed when one considers the penalty imposed upon the children of the priest. (Ezra 2:61-63.) They shall be cut off from the ordinances of the house of the Lord, and from their fathers who are dead and who were faithful. The separation of fathers, mothers, and children in eternity with the loss of eternal life, is far more serious than some members of the Church are prone to consider. President Joseph F. Smith in discussing this matter was emphatic, as brought out in this lesson, that Section 85 not only has reference to the law of consecration but also to the law of tithing because it took. The place of the former law. (Conference Report, October 1899, page 42.) QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 1. Tell what circumstances brought forth Section 85. 2. Why would you believe that letters can be scripture? 3. What relationship is there between the book of life and the book of the law? 4. Discuss: Section 85 is a commandment to observe the law of tithing. 5. What is the still small voice and who may enjoy its promptings? 6. What does the Lord say in Section 85 about the penalty of disobedience to his commandments? VISITING TEACHER MESSAGE Truths to Live By From the Doctrine and Covenants Christine H. Robinson Message 63 — "For They Shall Be Judged According to Their Works, and Every Man Shall Receive According to His Own Works..." (D&E 76:111). For First Meeting, April 1965 Objective: To be counted worthy and to receive the commendation of the Lord, our lives must be filled with fruitful actions. One of the most clearly established facts outlined in the scriptures is that men shall be judged by their works. Both ancient and modern scriptures are replete 64 with statements supporting this fact. The Savior in his parables and in his sermons frequently stressed the importance of performing good works. He said, "'Ye shall know them by their fruits" (Matt. 7:16), and emphasized the fact that, '""Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father " (Matt. 7:21). Also, "Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock" (Matt. 7:24). The apostle James admonishes us, "be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves" (James 1:22). The prophet Nephi said that the day should come "that they must be judged of their works, yea, even the works which were done by the temporal body..." (1 Nephi 15:32). The great King Benjamin instructed his people to believe in God and in his wisdom and power both in heaven and on earth, and warned them, "now, if you believe all these things see that ye do them"' (Mosiah 4:10). This standard of ''works" is one which has become a measure of an individual's worth, not only in religious matters but also in his attainments in every field of activity. We are judged by the skills we develop and apply, by our accomplishments, our attitudes, and by the extent and application of our wisdom. A great pianist, amidst thunderous applause, had just finished his masterful rendition of an extremely difficult concerto. After the performance one of his admirers approached him saying, "My, how wonderful! I would LESSON DEPARTMENT give my life to play as you do." To which the Maestro replied, "Madam, so far that is exactly what I have given." Regardless of the extent of our abilities, unless we work and develop them, we will never gain the highest achievement which we may obtain. In this great Church of the Lord's we shall not be entitled to the love and respect of our friends and neighbors nor the blessings from our Father in heaven simply because of our knowledge or gospel scholarship. Although knowledge and scholarship are important, they are useful only to the extent to which they are put to work in action in our lives. In this message from the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord said, that "every man shall receive according to his own works." This means that we cannot expect to lean on someone else's abilities or upon another's testimony. We must work diligently and develop our own. We must have the courage and the wisdom to be ourselves and to rely on ourselves. In the final analysis this is the only basis upon which we shall be judged. Someone has aptly said that no one can develop his muscles by sending his servant to the gymnasium. In a like manner our Father in heaven will not recognize a proxy statement when we present ourselves before him. Only if our own works so justify will we hear that blessed welcome, "'Well done, thou good and faithful servant... Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord" (Matt. 25:21). 99 65 WORK MEETING — Teaching the Gospel in the Home Alberta H. Christensen Lesson 3 — 'Faith, tf It-Hath Not Works, Is Dead'"' (A Course to Be Studied at Work Meeting, January Through September 1965) For Second Meeting, March 1965 Objective: To emphasize the fact that in order to obtain maximum blessings from the gospel of Jesus Christ, its teachings must be translated from belief: into worthy action. INTRODUCTION Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone (James 2:17). Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven (Matt. 7:21). Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin (James 4:17). THESE are significant scriptures. They state, in essence, that merely having a belief or knowledge of a gospel truth is not enough. Moreover, that for those who believe and understand the law but do not comply with the law, it will be considered as a "'sin." The implication is that we shall be judged in ratio to the light and understanding we possess. An awareness of this truth is essential for every individual who would, through conscious effort, increase his mental and spiritual growth and who would influence others for good. The importance of translating belief into action is basic to the Family Home Evening Program and also to these lessons which are written in support of that program. It is espe- 66 cially important that mothers be aware of this truth as_ they guide their children from infancy to adulthood. *' If ideas which are to be developed' as lessons are to have vitality, class members must become sufficiently involved that they will be led to think about those ideas and to ask questions. These lessons, however, will not have fulfilled their general objective unless they motivate us actually to put into practice the ideas and gospel teachings discussed. KNOWLEDGE PLUS ACTION It is encouraging to know that perfection is not attained in a day. It is helpful to realize that consistent and constant effort ——— a — may be necessary in order to replace a particular behavior pattern with a better one. Nor is there disgrace in failing' to achieve, if one earnestly tries — only in the unwillingness to try. The inhabitants of the ancient city of Enoch did not arrive at a condition of "exceeding" righteousness suddenly, nor by merely knowing the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ, but by living them. For two centuries after the appearance of the Savior on the Western Hemisphere, the Lamanites and the Nephites enjoyed the peace and happiness which are fruits of righteous living. We read in Fourth Nephi, verses 15-18:... There was no contention in the land, because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people. And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults.... There were no robbers, nor murderers, neither were there Lamanites, nor any manner of -ites; but they were in one, the children of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God. And how blessed were they! This state of happiness was not achieved by merely believing that Jesus is the Christ, but by incorporating into their lives the principles of righteous' living which his gospel embraces. VALUE OF CONSISTENT EFFORT Countless examples of the methods and the value of consistent effort might be cited. A simple illustration is that of the versatile Benjamin Franklin who, in his early teens, drew up a solemn and earnest list of thirteen virtues he wished to practice as a means of improving his character. In a small account book he LESSON DEPARTMENT recorded his successes and failures with the virtues. Franklin did not approach this project of self-improvement as a temporary. Effort, nor as a generalized resolve, but as a concentrated, specific endeavor. He focused his effort upon one virtue at a time, hoping that by so doing he would carve a pattern of performance which would be effective and lasting. TODAY VERSUS TOMORROW There is much value in acting promptly upon a worthy resolve. Resolutions, repeatedly postponed, can create a pattern of postponement. When unfilled objectives become numerous, a feeling of inadequacy and frustration often results. Whenever possible and practical, today, not next week nor next month, is the time to begin action on our good resolves. BELIEF VERSUS PERFORMANCE One of the strange paradoxes of human behavior is that we perform less well than we know how. Why is this so? Why do we not put into practice the principles which we know are right and which we know should be put into practice? That there is a gap between the level of understanding and the level of performance is well known to all trained teachers; it should be a subject of interest and concern to all parents. Each mother who takes her responsibility seriously will be led to ask herself, at one time or another, 'How can I be more effective in motivating our children to perform in closer accord with the teachings of the gospel?' More 67 JANUARY 1965 importantly, she may analyze herself with such questions as these: "Do my activities correspond with the values I say are most important to me? Why do I not maintain an attitude of patience in particular situations, when I know how important such an attitude is? What are the restraining forces which keep me from making necessary preparations on Saturday, in order that the Sabbath at our home may be more nearly as it should be — a day of rest and religious devotion?" An understanding, at least to some degree, of why a person performs as he or she does, is the basis of a sympathetic understanding of that person. This is of special importance in the mother and child relationship, and will be considered more concretely in a future lesson. LESSON APPLICATION Discussing the experiences of others is often useful in bringing a person to an awareness and to a solution of his own problems. Consider the following: Sister A. She is a conscientious and resourceful woman. Although her children are now married and her household _ responsibilities have greatly decreased, she fills her days with varied and interesting activities. On many occasions, in the past, she had planned that someday she would take time personally to become acquainted with the scriptures, to read beyond lesson - assigned chapter and verse. As the result of a particular Relief Society lesson, she was made acutely aware of the fact that time was slipping rapidly by 68 and that her reading objective remained unrealized. She resolved to begin at once, not next week nor next month. She adjusted her household schedule to allow for at least one half to one hour daily for the scripture-reading project. After two months of consistently following her plan she had established a performance pattern which was not difficult to follow. The satisfaction and spiritual insight which this activity brought, led her to wonder why she had not made this special effort long, long before. Sister B is the mother of six children. Motivated by a Relief Society theology lesson which stressed the spirituality and wisdom to be gained from a consistent reading of the scriptures, she decided she would really like to form this reading habit. However, as she checked her already closely scheduled days, she seriously wondered how she could possibly add even a half hour additional activity. She explained the situation and her desire to her two older children, ages thirteen and fifteen, who volunteered to relieve her of a particular household responsibility. Sister B was thus able to devote the time gained to the project. Her reading not only increased her understanding of the gospel, but she selected particular scriptures to share with the children in the Family Home Evening Program. Mothers must have a knowledge of the gospel not only to live righteously, but also in order to answer correctly questions of their children. Knowledge comes to them as they obey the words of the Savior "Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me" (John 5:39). In this day of skepticism and material interests, there are some to whom one memory of their youth is a cherished heritage — evenings at home, with father or mother reading from the scriptures, the children listening attentively. Surely a return to this practice will be an enriching experience for today's child, who has a challenging and doubting world to meet. LESSON DEPARTMENT THOUGHTS FOR DISCUSSION 1. Is a reading of the scriptures one of your unrealized objectives? 2. What schedule adjustment would you need to make were you Sister A? 3. What schedule adjustment would you consider feasible, were you Sister B? 4. What — schedule adjustment would you suggest for a mother with several very young children? 5. Is one more likely to carry out an activity if she makes a written or verbal commitment than if she merely makes a mental resolve? Discuss. 6. Am I a doer of the word or a believer, only? LITERATURE The Individual and Human Values As Seen Through Literature Dr. Bruce B. Clark Lesson 7 — Exploring Right and Wrong Attitudes Through Literature — Part III For Third Meeting, April 1965 Objective: To show how literature exposes the waste of self-righteousness and hypocrisy, and affirms the worth of genuine righteousness and sincerity. Tue lesson for this month is closely related in purpose to the one for last month. Again we explore several significant selections to see how literature exposes evil and defends goodness. However, whereas last month we studied four short stories, this month we examine five poems; and whereas last month the focus was on selfishness in relation to unselfishness, this month the focus is on self-righteousness and hypocrisy in relation to genuine righteousness and sincerity. Obviously these are very broad subjects. Thousands of works, great and small, have touched upon them, and the five short selections we are examining are mere 69 JANUARY 1965 samples. But they need no apology, for they are strong and excellent poems. Seven times, as recorded in the twenty-third chapter of St. Matthew, Jesus denounced the selfrighteous piety of the scribes and Pharisees with these words: ''Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!'"' Nothing in literature is more stinging than the repeated lash of these phrases. But literature, too, has been unsparing of the religious hypocrite who hides his evil underneath a cloak of self-righteous deceit. One of the most forthright in exposing self-righteous hypocrisy and in defending genuine righteousness and sincerity was the English poet Robert Browning (1812-1889),' whose "Johannes Agricola in Meditation" and "Sohiloquy of the Spanish Cloister'' are unforgettable portraits of evil men disguised as righteous men. Space will permit us to print only one of these poems here. Johannes Agricola in Meditation There's heaven above, and night by night I look right through its gorgeous roof; No suns and moons though e'er so bright Avail to stop me; splendor-proof I keep the broods of stars aloof. For I intend to get to God, For 'tis to God I speed so fast, For in God's breast, my own abode, Those shoals of dazzling glory, passed, I lay my spirit down at last. I lie where I have always lain, God smiles as he has always smiled; Ere suns and moons could wax and wane, Ere stars were thundergirt, or piled - 70 The heavens, God thought on me his child; Ordained a life for me, arrayed Its circumstances every one To the minutest; aye, God said This head this hand should rest upon Thus, ere he fashioned star or sun. And having thus created me, Thus rooted me, he bade me grow, Guiltless forever, like a tree That buds and blooms, nor seeks to know The law by which it prospers so. But sure that thought and word and deed All go to swell his love for me, Me, made because that love had need Of something irreversibly Pledged solely its content to be. Yes, yes, a tree which must ascend, No poison-gourd foredoomed to stoop! I have God's warrant, could I blend All hideous sins, as in a cup, To drink the mingled venoms up; Secure my nature will convert The draft to blossoming gladness fast; While sweet dews turn to the gourd's hurt, And bloat, and while they bloat it, blast, As from the first its lot was cast. For as I lie, smiled on, full-fed By unexhausted power to bless, I gaze below on hell's fierce bed, And those its waves of flame oppress, Swarming in ghastly wretchedness; Whose life on earth aspired to be One altar-smoke, so pure!— to win If not like God's love for me, At least to keep his anger in; And all their striving turned to sin. Priest, doctor, hermit, monk grown white With prayer, the brokenhearted nun, The martyr, the wan acolyte, The incense-swinging child— undone Before God fashioned star or sun! God, whom I praise; how could I praise, If such as I might understand, Make out and reckon on his ways, And bargain for his love, and stand, Paying a price, at his right hand?

Johannes Agricola was a German reformer of' the 16th century who headed a religious sect which held that faith only is necessary to salvation; morality' and good works, according to this group, do not aid one towards salvation. God chooses to save some and damn others, and people can do nothing to alter the will of God. Those who are saved are saved, and those who are damned _ are damned, irrespective of how good or bad the people may live. As the leader of this sect, Johannes holds an extreme position. In his monstrous conceit he. Believes that God has planned every minutest detail of his life and predestined him to_ salvation, "suiltless forever." So self-righteous is Johannes that. He thinks all vices (all "hideous sins') become virtues when performed by him, and all virtues are a waste of time when performed by others: The poem should be read not merely as an individual portrait of Johannes Agricola but as a satire against. Pride and selfrighteousness wherever they may be found. Browning believed just as strongly as do members of The Church of Jesus Christ of LatterLESSON DEPARTMENT day Saints that faith without works is dead and that an individual has the _ responsibility through an exercise of will power to work out his own salvation. He. Also believed, as do Latter-day Saints, that through faith and righteousness we can: know God. " Johannes rationalized that we can no more know God than we can "'bargain for his love." To understand Browning's own religious philosophy, all we need do is turn Johannes's beliefs upside down. As an ironic satire, this poem exposes the exact opposite of what Browning—and Latter-day Saint readers—recognize as the true principles of Christianity. Comment on "Soliloquy. Of. The Spanish Cloister."' Even better as poetry and as satire than."Johnnes Agricola" is. Browning's "'Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister."' This brilliant short poem is as vivid a portrait of self-righteousness, hypocrisy, lust, hate, and just downright meanness as Browning or any other poet ever composed. It describes everything that Browning detested in religious attitude and surface ritualism and, by implication, suggests his admiration for sincerity, honesty, brotherly love; simplicity, and just plain goodness. Unfortunately, however, space does not permit including this poem and a discussion of it in this lesson. Therefore, it will need to be studied in the literature text, where it is included in full. Comments on Two Poems by Robert Burns. Greatest of the Scottish poets and, if one can judge by the frequency of refer- 71 JANUARY 1965 ences to him, possibly President David O. McKay's favorite poet is Robert Burns (1759-1796). Although his personal life was rather loose and undisciplined, Burns in his poetry was an idealist with strong faith in the goodness of God and the potential goodness of man. He triumphs as a great poet in two kinds of poems especially—first, beautiful lyrics of love and friendship; and second, delightful satires attractively mixing humor with stinging criticism. He also wrote some very good narrative poems, but he is at his best in songs and satires. He is also at his best in the Scottish dialect that was his native tongue. For fuller comments on Burns and his poems than space permits here, and for a full printing of the two poems discussed here, see the Relief Society literature text. The two poems selected for special attention in this lesson are '""A Man's a Man for A' That" and "Address to the Unco Guid or the Rigidly Righteous,' and both are particularly concerned with good and bad attitudes, especially religious attitudes. The shorter of the two is ""A-Man's a Man for A' That," printed almost in full below: Is there for honest poverty, That hangs his head, an' a' that? The coward salve, we pass him by— We dare be poor for a' that! For a' that, an' a' that, Our toils obscure, an' a' that, The rank is but the guinea's stamp; The man's the gowd' for a' that. What though on hamely fare we dine, Wear hoddin grey' an' a' that? 72 Gie fools their silks, and knaves their wine— A man's a man for a' that! For a' that, an' a' that, Their tinsel show, an' a' that, The honest man, tho' e'er sae poor, Is king o' men for a' that. Ye see yon birkie,' ca'd a lord, Wha struts, an' stares, an' a' that? Tho' hundreds worship at his word He's but a cuif* for a' that: For a' that, an' a' that, His ribband, star, an' a' that, The man o' independent mind, He looks an' laughs at a' that. Then let us pray that come it may, As come it will for a' that, That Sense and Worth, o'er a' the earth, Shall bear the gree5 an' a' that; For a' that, an' a' that, It's comin yet for a' that, That man to man, the world o'er, Shall brithers be for a' that! This is a positive poem. In it Burns proclaims the dignity of common man and _ denounces whatever pretenses or artificialities destroy his dignity. Honesty, independence of mind, the brotherhood of man—these are the things that matter. Costly clothes, social position, fancy titles—these are mere decorations that hide what is genuine. "The honest man, however so poor, is king of man" is the central idea of this poem. "Address to the Unco Guid or the Rigidly Righteous" will need to be read in the literature text because it is too long to be printed here. All that we can here do is summarize the poem. It is a satire, humorous yet serious, addressed by Burns to those people who regard themselves as very good, very pious, very holy and who spend their time talking about their neighbor's faults and follies. I should like to speak, says Burns, in defense of all the poor mortals who often act unwisely and make mistakes. You look at them, he continues, and shudder at how weak and sinful they are compared with your strength and purity. But is the difference that great? Are you flawless—or just better at hiding? Also, you may now be grown up and beyond the temptations that "galloped" in your veins when you were young, but have you forgotten? Besides, maybe you're not any temptation. Therefore, look gently on men, and even more gently on women. Although they may do a little wrong, do not condemn them. Above all, consider not merely what they have done but why. God alone has the power to look into a human heart to judge actions and motives and regrets. He alone knows not only what one has done and why but what one has resisted doing and why. Man's responsibility is to forgive; only God, and his specially appointed representatives, have authority to judge. All of this is what ''Address to the Unco Guid" says. But the poem is better than the paraphrase, as poems always are. Comment on "Abou Ben Adhem." As a brief final selection focusing on the central subject of this lesson, we include Leigh Hunt's little poem "Abou Ben Adhem."' Although not one of the great writers, Hunt (1784-1859) is an important second-level English peet and critic of the Romantic Age. This famous short LESSON DEPARTMENT poem, stressing the importance of unselfish brotherly love, is simple in wording and openly clear in message: \ Abou Ben Adhem, may his tribe increase! Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace, And saw, within the moonlight in his room, Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom, An angel writing in a book of gold: — Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold, And to the presence in the room he said, "What writest thou?"—The vision raised its head, And with a look made of all sweet accord, Answered, "The names of those who love the Lord." "And is mine one?" said Abou. "Nay, not so," Replied the angel. Abou spoke more low, But cheerly still; and said, "I pray thee then, Write me as one that loves his fellow-men."' The angel wrote, and vanished. The next night It came again with a great wakening light, And showed the names whom love of God had blessed, And lo! Ben Adhem's name led all the rest. THOUGHTS AND QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 1. Identify as extensively and specifically as possible the various sins of attitude and behavior exposed by Browning and Burns in "Johannes Agricola in Mediation," 'Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister,' "A Man's a Man for A' That," and "Address to the Unco Guid or the Rigidly Righteous."' 2. Then identify as extensively and specifically as possible the good quali- 73 JANUARY 1965 ties and attitudes recommended by Browning and Burns in these four poems. 3. How do satire and. Irony help in. These poems to expose evil and advocate goodness? 4 4. Near the end of the lesson a prose paragraph of "Address to the Unco Guid or the Rigidly Righteous" is given. Then the comment is made, "But the poem is better than the paraphrase, as poems always are." Why is a poem better than a paraphrase of it? What does the paraphrase miss? 5. Probably experienced readers of literature will generally feel that of the five poems covered by this lesson, the most brilliant and best is Browning's "Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister." What qualities make this a better and more brilliant. Poem than the other four? 'For more extensive comments on Browning's life and writing, see Lesson Four in the October Relief Society. Magazine.

S. Ballif Lesson 20 — The Church Welfare Program For Fourth Meeting, April 1965 Objective: To increase our understanding of the meaning The Chuch Welfare Plan is the expression of a philosophy that is as old as the Church itself, and the Priesthood is the instrumentality through which its aims may be achieved, with auxiliary aid (John A. Widtsoe, 74 and implications of brotherhood. Priesthood and Church Government, page 289). The welfare' plan is a permanent plan for the purpose of extending temporary assistance to the individual, so far as his temporal needs are con- cerned, but permanent benefits so far as his spiritual welfare is involved. That is all there is to it (President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., Addresses, page 26). PRACTICAL RELIGION In a previous lesson, we have attempted to establish the important idea that in God's teachings to man there is no separation between temporal and_ spiritual things. President Joseph F. Smith says, "It is the purpose of God in restoring the gospel and the holy Priesthood, not only to benefit mankind spiritually, but also to benefit them temporally" (Gospel Doctrine, 1956 edition, page 209). This doctrine develops the idea that our work, our play, our study, or our participation in the activity of the Church should be governed by the same set of values. The teachings go even farther and assume that each person who belongs to the Church is actively interested in the spiritual and economic welfare of each and every other member of the organization. It is lmportant that one should be concerned about the conditions of his neighbors. Calamity may strike anyone of us at any time, but if we develop the idea of mutual aid, then there is an insurance against the day of misfortune. In President McKay's talk in a special welfare meeting held on April 5, 1949, he said, "Truly the man was right who said, 'The race of mankind would perish if they ceased to aid each other we cannot exist without mutual help. All, therefore, that need aid have a right to ask it from their fellow mortals; no one who holds the power of granting can refuse it without guilt.' " LESSON DEPARTMENT COOPERATION ESSENTIAL TO ONENESS During the time of President Brigham Young's leadership, the Church won its survival by mutual aid and cooperation. President Young stated: I say that they who are opposed to co-operation are opposed to heaven, to their own welfare, to the welfare of their neighbours, to truth and to everything that is good. The least thought or act of an individual who is or can be called a Saint. That militates against oneness of feeling and action amongst the Saints is opposed to everything that is heavenly and good.... If we are not one, we are not the Lord's. We can not do his will, nor be his disciples unless we are one (Journal of Discourses, 16:65). The Welfare Program provides the ideal vehicle for a practical expression of the above-stated philosophy. Every member of the Church can participate in the program either in_ production, preservation, or distribution of foods or materials. It is the fact that everyone can and should participate that makes the program so important. THE MEANING OF BROTHERHOOD People from every occupation and from every family in the Church can work together with a feeling that the Welfare Program belongs to them and the benefits are available for everyone who is in need. The person in need works side by side with the man in affluent circumstances. Both have a pride in the success of the project. The one in need can have the blessing of the work opportunity, while the other person feels a security and confidence in the continuance of 75 JANUARY 1965. A successful cooperative project. No one knows when calamity may strike or when he will need the cooperative effort of his quorum to help him solve his problem. Working in the Welfare Program, when physically able, removes any possibility of stigma that is sometimes attached to other systems of providing help to the needy. The man or woman who willingly works on the project can receive the blessings of his efforts in materials essential to his well-being. The person who works and does not need has the joy of knowing that his efforts have made it possible to relieve the suffering of his brother or sister. OPERATION OF THE WELFARE PROGRAM In the above discussion, stress has been placed on the attitude of the members toward the Welfare Program. After all, in Church work people are the main concern. In fact they, the people, constitute the Church, and the government of the Church is the Priesthood in action through worthy members of the Church. In order to get a clearer picture of the Welfare Program and its function, we will examine briefly two aspects of this important organization. First, we will summarize the means of production of welfare commodities. This involves all of the means: of producing the commodities needed to fill the welfare budget of the Church. Second, and of even more importance, we will examine the means of distribution of making the product available in the right place at the right time. Each aspect has required great 76 vision, careful planning, and the dedication of leaders and lay members alike, to make possible the realization of the objectives of the plan insofar as this has been achieved. It is true that production cannot be fully understood apart from distribution, but a quick look at the means of producing the tremendous welfare budget will give meaning to the method of making the materials available to the bishops to meet the needs of their people. 1. Production Every ward and stake has been advised and urged to. Secure means of producing in quantity the commodities their area can most naturally supply. They are encouraged to purchase farms, to produce hay and grain, to acquire cattle, to set up dairies, develop meat-producing projects, or factories for processing food, or making clothing. In fact, they are encouraged to develop all kinds of projects that will contribute to the budget requirements as recommended by the _ General Church Welfare Committee. The Church is set up into welfare regions. Each region is composed of a number of stakes. They are organized on the basis of geographical location and the commodities they are best prepared to produce. The wards and stakes are encouraged to develop projects that can best fit into the budget assignment of the region to which they belong. The productive power of the Welfare Program, in terms of farms, canneries, or industries, has made a remarkable growth in the twentyeight years since it was organized. 2. Distribution There are two important parts of this heading; the first, how much is needed to meet the demands of all the wards in the Church; and, second, who is going to distribute the commodities? The two parts must be discussed together to have proper meaning. The production of the welfare budget is, in reality, a miracle of cooperation. A budget is set up each year based on the actual usage of the previous year. Every bishop reports what he has used in assisting his members and on the basis of the past year's estimate, his need for the coming year. Budget making in the Welfare Program is a perpetual thing. While the bishop is using one budget, another one is being produced, and a third one is being estimated. The various regions of the Welfare Program produce as much of their own budget as possible, but, in their speciality, they produce a surplus which is available to the rest of the Church. After the commodities have been produced, who actually gets them into the hands of those in need? This service demonstrates a very real function of the Church organization. The Welfare Program does not require a new set of officers to fulfill its function, but it requires a careful organization of officers whom the Lord set up in the beginning. The heart of the care of the needy and the center of the distribution of commodities is in the hands of the bishop. He is the father of the ward and has a personal interest in every member. Support and assistance come LESSON DEPARTMENT from the Relief Society. The president of the Relief Society is a true social worker. Going into the homes of the needy, sick, and afflicted, under the direction of the bishop, after he has made a visit, she makes a realistic and practical study of the needs and the abilities of the family. This study becomes one basis for the help that the family will receive. The Priesthood in each ward is organized to assist in the welfare of the members. The ward welfare committee includes the ward Priesthood executive committee (consisting of the bishopric, the high priest group leader, the seventies president or group leader, the elders president or group leader, the general secretary of the Aaronic Priesthood over twenty-one, and the general secretary of the Aaronic Priesthood under twenty-one), the Relief Society presidency and a ward clerk. This committee meets and reports the conditions of the ward membership as to sickness, unemployment, or any other conditions that would impair the spiritual, temporal, or intellectual well-being of the members of the ward. This committee is to see to it that suffering in any family of the Church membership is alleviated. Through the bishop's order on the storehouse (usually one warehouse in each welfare region), the physical needs of the worthy members can be met. The bishop's storehouse has the commodities prepared by the many welfare projects throughout the Church and stored in this storehouse according to the budget needs of the bishops in the region. Today, the functioning of the Priesthood through home teachers could meet the needs of mem- 77 JANUARY 1965 bers, including their spiritual, temporal, and intellectual welfare. IN SUMMARY The Welfare Program, though very briefly reviewed above, is an excellent example of the functioning of religious idealism. Much is said about being our brother's keeper, unselfishness, and _ the Golden Rule, but in the Welfare Program, we have a practical application of true brotherhood. This is expressed in the unified approach to resolving the problems of poverty, both spiritual and material, among Church members. As long as the members have a desire to be self-supporting and are willing to do their best, then the Welfare Program provides the way for the quorum members to help their brothers without embarrassing them. Every project developed by wards or stakes presents a potential occupational opportunity for a member who is without employment. The unemployed person can join with others in a united effort to make the project successful. The needy person can spend as much time as he needs on a welfare project in order to care for his family. His quorum brethren work with him to establish him on a self-supporting basis. At the same time, the quorum members are constantly searching for permanent employment for their brother in an industry that will provide him with a greater opportunity to improve his economic situation. By the united effort of all Church members in support of the welfare projects, work opportunities are made available, and the needs of a person can be met 78 in the time-honored method of personal effort. Perhaps it should be emphasized here, at the conclusion of this lesson, that all Melchizedek Priesthood members will be encouraged to participate in activities pertaining to all phases of the Priesthood correlation program, including home teaching, genealogy, missionary, and welfare werk. The quorums or groups will engage in all these activities as directed by their respective Priesthood committees of the high council and in concurrence and cooperation with the ward bishopric and the ward council. The members of each quorum will be responsible and report directly to their group leaders in all phases of Priesthood work. However, the leadership of these Priesthood programs will be given to various groups. Thus, the leadership of the home teaching program rests with the bishopric working through and with the various Priesthood quorum and group leaders. The leadership for the genealogy program will be given to the high priests group, and the group leader will serve as the ward council adviser on genealogy. Similarly, leadership for missionary activities will be given to the seventies quorum or group in the ward, and the seventies leader in the ward will serve as the ward council adviser on missionary work. Under the direction of the bishopric, the elders quorum will be given the leadership for the Welfare Program, and the elders president or sroup leader will serve as the ward council adviser on welfare. However, the bishop will serve as chairman of the ward welfare committee and also serve as chairman of the ward council. The more closely we work together in the Church, the more we can appreciate the qualities of. Each other. If our effort is an effort of unselfish service to our fellow men, love and. Understanding are our reward. The total result is the unity, the oneness, that the Savior said we must have if we are his. THOUGHTS FOR DISCUSSION 1.
