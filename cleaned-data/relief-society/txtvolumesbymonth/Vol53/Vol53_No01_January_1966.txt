Magazine me 58 Number 1 i "Happy New Year'' has become a standard greeting and a common expression of kind wishes when a New Year dawns upon the world. The New Year suggests a time of beginnings and contemplates a closing of the door on the mistakes and difficulties of the past, except for those elements of good we may have extracted from them and upon which we may better build our lives. The expression "'Happy New Year'' becomes a natural manifestation of one's feelings and desires for his friends and associates. It is indeed an exemplification of the spirit of the second great commandment: 'Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.'' The General Presidency of Relief Society extends to Relief Society women throughout the world its very sincere wishes for a Happy New Year. Relief Society women have so much to make them genuinely happy. They have the sure knowledge of the truthfulness of the restored gospel, with its plan of life and salvation clearly delineated for them. Thousands of our Father's children find themselves in much the same position as the great Belgian playwright, Maeterlinck, when he exclaimed, ''If we knew but one thing to be true, would we not give our all!'' Relief Society members may be happy in the forward march of the work of this great and divinely inspired, Priesthood-directed organization. Happiness will flow to Relief Society members in the days ahead as they contemplate the development of their individual talents and characters through their Relief Society activities. They will also find happiness added to their lives in boundless measure through the sweet association of their Relief Society sisters. Surely every sister with mind and heart centered on the abiding truths of the gospel and devotedly engaged in the work of Relief Society, may look forward with confidence to much happiness in the New Year. The General Presidency and the General Board continually pray for the happiness and well-being of Relief Society sisters throughout the world. May they ever be blessed of the Lord with the joy which their unselfish devotion to our great work so much deserves. General Presidency, asient Colo | must write to thank you and tell you how thrilled | was to open the cover of my November Magazine and see our beautiful Mount McCaleb of the Lost River Mountains as the frontispiece. Our little town of Mackay rests at the foot of this lovely peak, and the mountain stands as a sentinel over our valley. The mountain is also my favorite view from my kitchen window. All of the Magazines are lovely and such an inspiration to all who read them. Leona B. Anderson Mackay, Idaho The wonderful Relief Society Magazine has been coming to our home for five years, and the teachings, both in love and spirituality, have helped tremendously in building our marriage and home. My husband has been attending school since we were married, and living on the kind of budget students live on, the Magazine has helped me greatly in figuring shortcuts, inexpensive food items, and sewing ideas, not to mention the uplift | receive from the Magazine when | need encouragement. Mrs. Marsha Ball Urbana, Illinois | am only twenty years old and single, but subscribe to The Relief Society Magazine. | think the Magazines would help the young women, for they could understand the appeal to the heart and to the personal being. They could learn of their roles as tomorrow's leaders of the women of the Church. Ailien Winn Smithfield, Utah | do love The Relief Society Magazine—the greatest of all magazines for women. Without it | would be lost. It gives me great inspiration each time | pick it up. It makes one feel close to the Heavenly Father. Its beauty, both inside and out, is beyond expression. Mrs. Ollie M. England Logan, Utah | would like to express my appreciation and thanks to a wonderful missionary sister from Utah. We had the pleasure of her company in our home, and we grew to love her very much. After she returned home she very kindly had The Relief Society Magazine sent to me, and | receive it regularly each month. | enjoy reading it so much, especially the poems and serials. To Sister Beth McEwan and all the wonderful missionary sisters and elders I've had the pleasure of meeting and having in my home, | would like to say thank you most sincerely, and God bless you. Doreen Burrows Port Kembla, N. S. W. Australia The poem ''Yesterday's Gold," by Dorothy Roberts (September 1963) still stays with me. Rarely does a poem affect me as this one has. After two full years, | am unable to get it out of my mind. In this poem, as in a perfect painting, you catch the pathos of poignant grief. It is a touching poem, a great one. | have not read a poem in some time that | think can compare with it. The poem ''Requited," by Bertha Kleinman is also outstanding and beautiful. There is a delicacy about it not often found in poems. Rose A. Openshaw Mesa, Arizona |! Am happy to report that more and more of the young homemakers in our ward are reading the educational and inspirational Magazine and also participating in Relief Society meetings. This morning | was reading again the September 1965 issue. | enjoyed Frances C. Yost's story "A Dress for Sherry Lynn," just as much this morning as when | read it about three weeks ago. The warmth of family love, the joy of sharing and taking turns written about in this lovely story, are indeed heartwarming.

Teaching the President Joseph Fielding Smith of The Council of the Twelve (Called to the First Presidency October 29, 1965) [Address Delivered at the officers meeting of the Relief Society Annual General Conference, September 29, 1965] (Read by his wife, Jessie Evans Smith, in his absence) Sister Smith: Thank you, Sister Spafford. I don't know whether I am grateful to be here this morning or not. I was looking forward to it yesterday, but like Brother Doxey, I have heen watching the door over here hoping that the brethren would come in, but they haven't, but I love you and I am grateful to be here with you this morning. My husband doesn't generally write his speeches, but he said, "I feel that I should do something this time in order to give the sisters the message. I don't know why I feel like that," he said, "but I think I should just put down a few remarks." So, with your faith and prayers on my behalf, I will give what President Smith has for you sisters. It is entitled, "Teaching the Gospel." @ My dear sisters, I hope and pray that I may say something that will be upbuilding to your testimonies, and I ask that the Lord will bless me with inspiration to give the things that you desire. The Church has_ two great responsibilities. That is, the members of the Church have these responsibilities. It is our individual duty to preach the gospel by precept and by example among our neighbors. In 4 Section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants, we are informed that even those who are warned are under the obligation to receive the message and also to wam their neighbors. The people who are living are entitled to hear the message, so this responsibility to teach the world is an outstanding one. We cannot get away from the obligation. The Lord declared that his coming is nigh at hand. It is ' our duty, then, to do all we can, and the Lord will bring to our aid other forces besides our missionaries, that his work may be advanced and his words be fulfilled. I speak of this responsibility at this time for fear there may be some who think the work they are doing is the great work of this dispensation. The people engaged in the Relief Society and other auxiliaries feel that they have great responsibility and they have, but their work does not overshadow this great duty of preaching the gospel to the world. Now, there are many debts which we owe the Lord. There is the debt of preaching this gospel to a wicked and perverse generation, and those are the words of the Lord, so do not accuse me of calling the world wicked. It is. I can testify to that from what I have seen of it, and I have seen of the wickedness but a small part, I assure you. The world today is filthy, drunken, saturated and stinking with tobacco. The world is full of immorality. It is a fallen world. It has been a fallen world since Adam was driven from the Garden of Eden, and yet we are in it, and the Lord has given us the mission of assisting him, of being agents in this world, to regenerate it, as far as it is possible to bring to pass that regeneration. It will never be fully accomplished, so far as we are concerned. We are not going, by our preaching, to save very many souls. The Lord has given unto us our agency. We may act for ourselves, we may choose to do good or we may choose to do evil. The Lord said that men love darkness TEACHING THE GOSPEL rather than light because their deeds are evil. Yet our mission, I say, so far as it is within our power, is to regenerate, to bring to repentance, just as many of the children of our Father in Heaven as it is possible for us to do. That is one of our debts; that is an obligation the Lord has placed upon the Church. It is the duty of every member of this Church to preach the gospel by precept and by example. The purpose and duties of the Relief Society are many. I am going to repeat myself again because there may be some here today who were not here when I made this statement before, and I also have the backing of my father, President Joseph F. Smith. "This is an organization that was established by the Prophet Joseph Smith. It is, therefore, the oldest auxiliary organization of the Church, and it is of the first importance. It has not only to deal with the necessities of the poor, the sick and the needy, but a part of its duty—and the larger part, too —is to look after the spiritual welfare and _ salvation of the mothers and daughters of Zion; to see that none is neglected, but that all are guarded against misfortune, calamity, the powers of darkness, and the evils that threaten them in the world. It is the duty of the Relief Societies to look after the spiritual welfare of themselves and of all the female members of the Church. It is their duty to collect means from those who have in abundance, and to distribute it wisely unto those in need. It is a part of their duty to see that there are those capable of being nurses, as well as teachers and exemplars 5 JANUARY 1966 in Zion, and that they have an opportuniy to become thoroughly prepared for this great labor and responsibility. I have heard of a disposition on the part of some of our sisters to become a law unto themselves in relation to these things. I would like to say that it is expected of the Relief Society, especially the general authorities of that great organization, that they will have a watchcare over all its organizations among the women of Zion. They stand at the head of all such; they ought to stand at the head, and they should magnify their calling, and see to it that error is not permitted to creep in, that cabals are not formed, that secret combinations may not get a foothold, to mislead the sisters. They should see to it that the other organizations of women in the Church correspond and are in harmony with their organizations. Why should this be? In order that the women of Zion may be united, that their interests may be in common, and not conflicting or segregated, and that the purpose of this organization may be realized and the organization itself be effective for good in every part of the Church throughout the world, wherever the gospel is preached.... [ commend the Relief Societies to the bishops and say, be friendly to these organizations, because they are auxiliary organizations and a great help to the bishops...." It is the duty of the Relief Society "to look after the interests of all the women of Zion and of all the women that may come under their supervision and care, irrespective of religion, color or condition. Today it 6 is too much the case that our young, vigorous, intelligent women feel that only the aged should be connected with the Relief Society. This is a mistake. We want the young women, the intelligent women, women of faith, of courage and of purity to be associated with the Relief Societies of the various stakes and wards of Zion. We want them to take hold of this work with vigor, with intelligence, and unitedly, for the building up of Zion and the instruction of women in their duties—domestic duties, public duties, and every duty that may devolve upon them." The matter of teaching is one of the greatest importance. We cannot estimate its value when it is properly done; neither do we know the extent of the evil that may result if it is improperly done. The greatest qualification required of a teacher is that she have faith in the principles of the gospel; that she believe in the principles of revealed truth as they have come through inspired prophets in our own day as well as in times of old; and that he or she shall exercise their privilege as a teacher in the spirit of prayer and faith. I am in full accord with the commandment as it is written in this revelation. Unless a man (or woman) does have a knowledge of the truth, has faith in the word of the Lord and his power, and is guided by the Spirit of the Lord, he should not teach. We are commanded "to give diligent heed to the words of eternal life." For we "shall live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God. For the word of the Wee cents Lord is truth, and whatsoever is truth is light, and whatsoever is light is Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ." I was handed a poem the other day by Sister Pauline Marie Bell which fits in with Relief Society and I would like to give it to you now: Ancient mothers, God has blessed you With a hope so mighty strong Thou didst give a glorious pattern, Courage filled our hearts with song— Relief Society in faith united Walking where the Savior trod, Gazing upward to that Giver, TEACHING THE GOSPEL Praising ever Israel's God. Daughters of those faithful Marys, Sharing woe with Christ so true, Faith undaunted, God has given— Blessings are fulfilled in you. Zion's daughters, meek and loyal, Children of that chosen band, True and faithful, God has called you, To assist his mighty hand. May we all strive to keep the commandments, and the Lord will bless us in our work, and may he bless each of you with a desire to follow in paths of righteousness, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, Amen. HOW HAVE WE FOLLOWED? Christie Lund Coles These words he spoke, 'I now turn the key... Others admonishing and wise, as he said We should have charity, relieve the poor. We should partake of all spiritual bread. We were to be patient; we should share, And walk as sisters of mercy and light, Healing, administering to the needs Of others, as a kindly mother might. How have we followed? How have we kept faith? How have we met the call of those who. Came, Asking for a nourishment more real Than any food or drink the lips can name? How have we given aid, how have we shown True depth of understanding, and the sweet Friendship that heals a solitary way, Or puts new courage into ageing feet? How have we shared our portion with the least, Giving — as privilege and not as ration — And, oh, above all else, we followers, How have we given love and true compassion? veil eee i The posture of arrival, the meaning of mercy. - Leafed in gold, repeat, repeat, ~ Lest one mind remember not the small company,; ont in almost-surrender - Declare, though pinions wear the weight of frost, _ That grain grew after, gold As the leaf on your breast.

First Prize Poem 10 LETTER TO VIET NAM Eva Willes Wangsgaard The summertime was rich—the sorrel foaled, The Guernsey yielded twins, the crops were lush. Each hour fitted well the patterned mold And high stars twinkled over midnight hush— A summer like all others, picnic-true. We fished the Blackfork, iced a worthy load. We swam and boated. Bear Lake was as blue When we looked backward from the canyon road. But | walk two dimensions—one aware Of outer fullness blessing stall and bin, While my insurgent heart denies its share. Its threshing leaves an emptiness within. Abundance harvested, the beasts' content Without your nearness seem inconsequent. Now leaves are making music overhead. The winds raise slender flutes above the beat, A plaintive number saying, '"'Summer's dead,"' While still the grass is green beneath my feet. The willows drop long tears where leaves are thinned; The lindens twist in Spanish pirouettes. The Norway maples whistle with the wind And sycamores shake balls and castinets. Where locust blossoms filled the April night With fragrance, penetrating, intimate, Now pod-harmonicas lift strains as light While leaves twirl grace notes, golden, intricate. In loneliness breathed through these vibrant reeds Another year leans where the mallard leads. Today | walked across our stubbled fields While still the frost flakes sparkled everywhere. | strode along to where the mountain wields Its stubborn strength against our spade and share. Do you remember from the years gone by How golden is our valley in the fall? How aspens, poplars, elders, shrubs all vie To be more golden than a warbler's call? | played a childish game, a thin pretense That you were with me striding hand in hand. Did you draw one crisp breath? A moment sense This brisk, bright freshness pass through jungle land? A wild goose honked, and in that spike of sound | read ''Return'' and felt my faith rebound. Eva Willes Wangsgaard First Prize Winner Eliza R. Snow Poem Contest Eva Willes Wangsgaard, Ogden, Utah, has had several books of her poems published, has received prizes in many state and national contests, and is one of Utah's best known and best loved poets. ''! Am still living in the home on 28th Street,'' she tells us, ''and am still enthralled with the garden in the growing seasons, where several organizations hold their summer parties. All three of the children live in Cache Valley; the thirteen grandchildren are growing up. Two are married, with two children each. One, the oldest girl, finished college last year and is teaching in Salt Lake City. Her brother Joseph David Evans is in West Germany serving a mission. Michael Wangsgaard, my son Dee's eldest, is back from a mission to the Northeastern States. He was married this past August, and both he and his wife are finishing their college courses at the Utah State University. Jim, my son Reid's son, is also attending Utah State. "lam still writing poetry. My chief outlets are the national literary contests and the various church magazines. My latest achievement "Night in the Mountains,'' a sonnet, was chosen to illustrate the poet's approach to nature in a new text ''Science: a Key to the Future,"' for junior high schools, published by the Macmillan Company. | have a biographical note in Who's Who in Poetry International, and in International Biography, both books compiled and published by UNESCO.'' 1] Second Prize Poem LEGACY Julie H. Beecher Apart, those days and these, Great-grandma's nearly hundred years stretch thin with turning hours And lengthened days until the merest link remains. Apart, her life and mine This present brightness seen through dimming lens, her ageing eyes; The drifting colors blended low to soft pastels, There is no harshness here. All sight and sound are tempered, cushioned, soothed By senses slower now but still aware... So justly delicate, Made fragile by the twisting, tumbling, turning on and on of time, So many years alone spent cloaked in memories. How good that time is not all, But only part. And that's the harvest then The good thick grass, the golden crop Time is not all. We are not separate in the end, This woman from another world and |. The years affect us only now; She leans nearly double... Withering porcelain, | am yet tall and strong with beginnings. She has lived for all the years I'll live And has been many things I'll be; Some day my hours will be reflections, too, Another circle, different thoughts, but close Because the retrospect is quiet, inward, sacred Recalling birth and smiles and conversation, Holding these inside until expression is lost; It's all the same her world and mine. All, in the end is harvest. Only time's wedge is between us, And it, too, will be pried out. We're bound together not by only blood, But tied by tears and grief and growth As women sisters are. We are united, touching, reaching out and back, Below and upward, on past time, through layered years Toward eternity with all our kind How good that time is not all. 12 Julie H.

Olsen The boundless ocean groaned! Its heaving strength Moved restlessly with bidding will of moon And wind, in ever-changing tidal length! Waves whipped in furious widening typhoon While roots of future islands, being born In darkest layers rupturing earth's core Spewed high again! Only the ocean, torn And timeless, knew the forming on its floor! Relentless effort, claiming right to be— With inch by painful inch of straining birth; Volcanic base, fringed coral filigree— A subterranean chain of writhing earth! The child of violence, risen from the deep— Mature and willing, luring nature's leap! The youthful surfaces of earth's marred shell— Nude islands, raw and waiting, empty-armed, Were swept by winds without a parallel And pounded by the force of rain's alarm! Their milling acts, on lava newly born, Made fertile soil for growth of migrant seed Let fall by halting bird, long weather-worn, Into a niche where sprouting could proceed. A few insects, wind-borne from distant land, With fragmentary green, wilting from strife— Found ways to give sweet growth to bare, unscanned And pregnant soil's potential—beauteous life! While poised on far-off shores, hoping to span The ocean, strained the earth's exploring man! Ke & € We traveled into other lands where strange Unheeding eyes were set in alien clay. We sought for words within a bounded range Of verbal comprehension—to convey A strengthened lexicon in daily fare. We felt endearing warmth in cultures' ring; Considered remnant nations melting where East met West, in nature's subtle blending. We found within the cauldron those who knew The plan of life we cherished in our hearts. We loved and understood, as children do, The others whom a mother's womb imparts. Our love identified to kind—beyond The barriers of speech, in spirit bond!: Pearle M. Olsen Third Prize Winner Eliza R. Snow Poem Contest Pearle M. Olsen, Salt Lake City, Utah, former president of North Sanpete Stake Relief Society, and former member of the General Board of Relief Society, is a second-time winner in the Eliza R. Snow Poem Contest. ''l am delighted to be an award winner again this year,'' she says. "'I find the years are challenging me for continued self-expression in the fields of creativity, and | especially enjoy the writing of poetry. A two-year mission call shortly before my nineteenth birthday interrupted my formal schooling. When marriage and family responsibilities ensued, | found that teaching in the Church auxiliaries, and educational classes, as | made time for them, helped to satisfy my quest for learning and development. Actually, the various positions | have held in Relief Society provided the greatest opportunities for intensive study and continuing education during most of my life. The past few years | have turned to writing classes and writers' organizations for stimulation and enlightenment. "My husband, William Carlyle Olsen, is a member of Ensign Stake High Council. Our three children are: Mrs. E. G. Jenkins (Billye) of Nampa, Idaho; John K. M. Olsen, Los Altos, California; and Mrs Robert Morris (Carlyle), Salt Lake City, Utah. We have fourteen grandchildren, seven girls and seven boys."' 15 @ The Relief Society General Board is pleased to announce the award winners in the Annual Relief Society Short Story Contest, which was announced in the May 1965 issue of The Relief Society Magazine, and which closed August 15, 1965. The first prize of seventy-five dollars is awarded to Evelyn Elizabeth Vesterfelt, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, for her story ''For Barbara, With Love.'' The second prize of sixty dollars is awarded to Venda Brown Castleberry, Rigby, Idaho, for her story ''A Time to Every Purpose."' The third prize of fifty dollars is awarded to Lael J. Littke, Monterey Park, California, for her story ''The Search for Katie.' The Annual Relief Society Short Story Contest was first conducted by the Relief Society General Board in 1942, as a feature of the Relief Society Centennial observance, and was made an annual contest in 1943. The contest is open to Latter-day Saint women who have had at least one literary composition published or accepted for publication in a periodical of recognized merit. Award winners The three prize-winning stories will be published consecutively in the first three issues of The Relief Society Magazine for 1966. Forty-nine stories were entered in the 1965 contest, including submissions from Wales, England, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, and Alaska. Mrs. Vesterfelt is a first-time winner in the short story contest, and the General Board of Relief Society is pleased to see a Canadian sister among the winners. Mrs. Castleberry received the first prize in last year's contest, and Mrs. Littke placed second last year. The contest was initiated to encourage Latter-day Saint women to express themselves in the field of fiction. The General Board feels that the response to this opportunity continues to increase the literary quality of The Relief Society Magazine and aids the women of the Church in the development of their gifts in creative writing. Prize-winning stories are the property of the General Board of Relief Society and may not be used for publication by others except upon written permission from the General Board. The General Board reserves the right to publish any of the other stories submitted, paying for them at the time of publication at the regular Magazine rate. A writer who has received the first prize for two consecutive years must wait for two years before she is again eligible to enter the contest. Gratitude is extended to the members of the General Board who served on the short story committee, and to the judges who evaluated the stories and selected the winning entries. 16 FIRST PRIZE-WINNING STORY The Relief Society Short Story Contest c > od | e Bart AKO cil Wd Witl aa 1! Ta | Love Evelyn Elizabeth Vesterfelt Sudbury, Ontario, Canada @ Barbara took down the box of letters, choosing one carefully from the rather untidy collection within. The outer page was torn a little and beginning to take on the color of age. Opening the letter slowly, she began to read. "Darling, at last I can tell you where I am and why you haven't heard from me for quite awhile. This is D-day plus seven. I left England for the Continent on D-day plus three. (Isn't this a ridiculous way to describe time?) I keep thinking of that last night we were together at Winchester and the 'heavenly' meal of beans on toast at that old-fashioned restaurant. We had so much to say to each other and time was so short. "Darling, before I left England I mailed a book to you at your army address. Did you receive it O. K.? Will you read it and let me know what you think of it? Remember our discussions: on this subject and your utter amazement at my 'credibility'? "Do you recall our standing in the rain outside your billet, with your twelve-o'clock deadline, and so many words left unspoken? I told you I loved you and asked you to wait for my return. You touched my cheek gently with your lips and whispered, 'It's impossible, I've been so careful not to fall in love, especially with an American soldier!' "T love you, Barbara,. And we will have a future together. Because of this love, I want to share my thoughts, my dreams with you. Darling, you'll like America, and I'm sure you will be happy there with me. I have written my family and told them about my 'English sergeant.' I'm not going to write of the fighting here, or of the unspeakably sordid aspect of war. 7 "Thank you for your poem and for your overly kind comments on my poetry. I'll try to write often. Read the book I sent please. '"'Love me in absence as I love you. "Mac 9? Barbara brushed the tears almost surreptitiously away. Her thoughts went back to those war years. It was November 1943. Barbara and Monica, her closest friend, were planning their long week end in London. Monica, looking rather worried, turned to Barbara. "T hate to tell you this, but I got a letter from Cam—you know —the American I met on my last leave. He wants to see me this week end in London. I've been wanting to tell you all week, but I knew we had planned this week end together and." "Oh, Monica, don't feel badly about it, I can visit my aunt. She lives just outside London." Monica looked forlorn. "But I do feel awful! I know, why don't I write and ask if he has a friend a sort of blind date? That's what I'll do, I'll write tonight!" Barbara shook her head fiercely. "No, no, I really don't approve of blind dates, they often prove embarrassing to both parties, especially if they don't hit it off." She smiled reassuringly. Monica was insistent. ''Listen, Babs, Cam is a decent fellow, and I'm sure he will bring a nice friend. Do say you'll come with me!" Barbara thought of the longanticipated week end, and the prospect of spending it in Aunt Selina's huge, lonely house. "All right, but there's no obligation attached. Impress this upon your American friend."' Now they were both on their way to London, Monica bubbling with excitement, and Barbara feeling apprehensive at the prospect of the unknown blind date. Their room on the top floor of the Y. W. C. A. On Baker Street was small but spotless. Monica had arranged for them to meet their dates in the downstairs lounge at eight o'clock in the evening. Dressing was no problem, it simply meant a change of uniform, shirt, and shoes. Barbara felt a surge of excitement within her. This really was different, preparing to meet a blind date. Promptly at eight they descended the narrow spiral staircase leading into the lounge, Monica well ahead, eyes shining and anxiously scanning the room for the two American uniforms. Barbara hung back. "Monica, I don't see any American soldiers, they didn't turn up." Monica hadn't heard. Forgetting her lady-like descent, she streaked across the room and into the arms of a husky, dark-eyed American soldier, previously halfhidden by a reception cubicle. "Cam, oh, Cam how nice to see you again!'"' Monica hugged him joyfully. "Monica, honey." Cam _ held her at arms' length. ""We have an audience. This is Mac, full name, Glen McKinley.... By the way, where's your friend?" Barbara stepped shyly forward, extending her hand to meet Mac's. FOR BARBARA, WITH LOVE "Hello, Barbara, happy to know you." His grip was firm. Barbara raised her eyes to meet his, and to take a better look at her blind date. He was tall, well over six feet in height, with deep blue C eyes and a broad smile. His hair was red, flaming red! Thought Barbara, one couldn't really call him handsome, but he has a certain boyish look which is extremely attractive. Mac was also taking stock. How tiny she is, about five feet high... And I'll bet she doesn't weigh over ninety pounds! His eyes photographed her features. Not vividly beautiful, he thought, dark hair tucked neatly beneath her severe army cap. Tiny, piquant face, wide-set gray eyes, a friendly smile... No, not beautiful, but certainly appealing. He gave her a warm smile. Together, they left the residence after deciding unanimously to go dancing at Covent Garden. Mac held Barbara's arm protectively as they edged along the crowded street. He seemed reluctant to start a conversation, and Barbara felt rather shy and quite conscious of the warmth of his hand on her arm. The ballroom was comfortably filled. As soon as a table was secured, Monica and Cam got up to dance. Mac smiled at Barbara. "I'm not the best dancer in London, but shall we try this one?" The orchestra opened with the sweet, haunting strains of "Besame Mucho,' and _ Barbara glided into Mac's arms. Oh, dear, he dances differently than I I do hope my feet behave themselves, she _ fretted momentarily. I'm very 19 JANUARY 1966 He held her close, yet not uncomfortably so. Her steps blended magically with his, and they were no longer strangers. How quickly the evening passed, and, as they walked back to her billet, through streets black and lampless, Mac asked if he could see her again the next day. "Do you really want to see me —or is it because you feel you ought to carry this 'blind date' role to the end?" Barbara quickly touched his hand. "I'm. Sorry. I shouldn't have said that, please forgive me." "Now look here, sergeant, if I didn't want to see you again I wouldn't ask for a date!" He threw her a puckish grin. "After all, I've always wanted to get on good terms with a sergeant. I couldn't pass up such an opportunity. And, incidentally, how come a half-pint like you ever made sergeant?" Barbara laughed merrily, "I'm asked that question dozens of times a week! My anwer is always the same — I sat on the colonel's knee!"' He ducked as if from an imaginary blow. "Ouch, I deserved that!" They climbed the steps of the residence. He held her hand in his, seeing her face dimly in the darkness. "Goodnight, little sergeant, I'll see you tomorrow at twelve noon, Trafalgar Square." That night Monica and Barbara talked for hours, and Barbara fell asleep with the memory of Mac's gentle arm around her as they danced. Monica and Cam had made different plans. They were to see the changing of the guard at 20 Buckingham Palace. Barbara explained her arrangements with Mac. "Oh, Monica, how are we going to get together? I forgot to ask about your arrangements!" Monica airily waved her hand. "Think nothing of it. I gain the distinct impression that Corporal McKinley wants to be alone with his sergeant." She smiled slyly. Once again Barbara experienced a surge of excitement as she walked towards Trafalgar Square and her second meeting with Mac. Would he be there would he change his mind? There were so many diversions for the American soldiers in London.... Would he feel it was worth his while to keep the appointment? Her heart leapt as she saw him standing there, watching the strutting pigeons. He hurried to meet her with a broad smile of welcome on his boyish face. "Gosh, I was getting anxious!" Gently, he squeezed her arm. "Is there any special place you'd like to go, or shall we take the day as it comes?" He smiled questioningly. "No special place,' Barbara quickly added, "but what about you? You're an American, and perhaps I ought to show you the sights." They turned into Piccadilly. "Honey," Mac replied, 'I've seen all the sights, honest! What about lunch and an afternoon dance somewhere... And then the theatre... O. K.?" "Mac, you'll never get tickets for the theatre unless you book months ahead!" She shook her head at his naivete. '"Ah-ha.... Abracadabra and voila!"? He waved two tickets in front of her. "Sheer bribery, that's what it is!" Barbara's eyes shone. "Tickets to 'This Is the Army'.... How did you manage it? No, don't tell me, that would be collusion, an accessory after the fact, or something like that!' She hugged his arm impulsively. Mac's heart did a somersault. Why did he feel such tenderness towards this girl who was almost a stranger? That night, as they walked along Baker Street, he told Barbara of his reluctance to accept Cam's offer of a blind date. His hand found hers. "'I sure am glad I came, little one!" It had been a memorable day, spent in discovering each other, sharing each other's hopes and dreams for the future. Barbara told him of her attempts to write poetry, and felt a warm glow when Mac confessed also that he wrote poetry. "IT make a wild stab at it. I've done it for years, but I'm no Walt Whitman!" He laughed. "What about you?" "T'm no Christina Rosetti and I've also penned my poor efforts for years!" He told of his Sunday School work, and of his unwavering faith in God. Before' they parted, he kissed her for the first time, somewhat shyly yet quite thoroughly. Barbara felt a strange stirring within her breast. She responded warmly to his kiss. "Goodnight, Barbara. Tomorrow we will have only a few hours together. What time does your train leave? Mine leaves at 8:35 P. M." FOR BARBARA, WITH LOVE "Our train leaves at 7:30 P. M. Worse luck! The week end has simply flown!" She opened the door of the residence, closing it quickly behind her so that no light would pierce the blackout. Their last precious hours were spent walking through St. James' Park, kicking the dry leaves, talking, enjoying long moments of silence. "You'll write to me?" His expression was serious. "I don't want to lose you now that I've traveled thousands of miles to find you!" He grinned impishly. "That sounds comy, but I mean it!" Barbara pressed his hand to her side. "Of course I'll write, and I'll send you one of my poems if you will send me yours, only -.. Promise not to laugh at them." "That goes for you, too. I am afraid you'll chuckle when you read mine!"' They both expertly jumped a puddle. "Come on!" She tugged at his hand. '"Let's feed the swans. I saved two biscuits for this momentous occasion. Race you to the lake!" "Lake! Which lake... You mean that little creek down there!" Barbara threw a handful of leaves. '""That, my dear American, ls a lake, and I'll not listen to any tall tales of Texas." He adopted an air of injured innocence, "I am not, repeat not a Texan, I'm from Oregon!" "And this is a lake, not, repeat not a creek!" Barbara stretched to her full height. ""And I'm from Yorkshire, not from London!" They both laughed as, with a great show of ceremony, she handed him a biscuit. '""Mr. Mc- 21 JANUARY 1966 Kinley, your ration for this week, and half must go to the swans!" He _ scrutinized the golden wafer in his hand and, turning to her with a mischievous glint, exclaimed, '"'Ah, a cookie, a genuine English cookie!"' Barbara exploded, "It is a biscuit, not a cookie! When in Rome They sat by the edge of the lake, the November mist giving them an unexpected privacy. Each grew silent, thinking of the parting so close at hand. As the train began to move away from the platform, Mac whispered something softly against her cheek. "This is crazy, but I think I'm in love." They watched each other until the train rounded a curve in the tracks. Did she really hear those words, or was it just imagination? Afterwards, there were letters, many of them, some containing poems, and one bulging with snapshots. There were outpourings of the heart, and a growing understanding of each other. There was a final meeting in Winchester, and a declaration of love. Both knew there was something big about to happen, some great push, or the opening up of another front in some far-off theatre of war. A week after their meeting and subsequent reluctant parting in Winchester, Barbara received a 22 parcel from Mac. Twelve bars of precious chocolate and two bars of soap. Nestled in the centre of this treat was a book similar in appearance to the Bible. On the fly leaf was written, "For Barbara, with love. Because I know that our future belongs together, I am sending you this book. I want to share my faith with you, and ask only that you read with an open mind, praying for understanding of those things which may seem incomprehensible to you. I love you, Mac." She kept the book in her room in the sergeants' mess, looking at it only occasionally, understanding nothing that was written there. The history written therein was totally alien to her. She was puzzled by its literacy, but too engrossed by the war to delve deeper into its mysteries. Twenty-nine days after Mac landed on the Continent of Europe with the invasion forces, Barbara received a letter from Cam. "Dear Barbara: This is a sad assignment for me. I must be the one to break the news of Mac's death. He was killed in action on D-day plus eleven. I myself am in a base hospital, but not badly hurt, just a few scratches. I'm terribly sorry. I really don't know what else can I say. God bless you, Cam." Barbara folded the faded letter and replaced it at the bottom of the pile in the box. Her small son threw his arms around her legs. '"'Mommy, did you fall.... Why are you crying?" He looked up anxiously into her face. "No, dear. Mommy is just remembering someone, a very nice person whom I knew a long time ago." She moved her finger along the rows of books, stopping to take out one similar in appearance to the Bible. She traced the embossed title on the cover. "What is it called, Mommy?" asked her son. "Is it a fairy | story?" She sat down by the telephone, lifted the child into her arms, and read the title slowly to him. "The Book of Mormon.."' | "Ts it a fairy story? May I hear it?" Barbara opened the book to the fly leaf. As she read the inscription, the past became the present for her once more. "For Barbara, with love. Because I know that our future belongs together, I am sending you this book. I want to share my faith with you, and ask only that you read with an open mind, praying for understanding of those things which may seem incomprehensible to you. I love you, Mac." Absentmindedly, she _ ruffled her son's hair, thinking of the years between. Of the new love she had found, of her subsequent FOR BARBARA, WITH LOVE marriage, and the birth of this dear child. On the telephone pad was a number which she slowly dialed. "Hello. This is Mrs. Barbara Thomas. You gave me your number to call in case I should change my mind. You knocked at my door earlier today, and I said I was not interested. Well, I have changed my mind. I'd like to hear what you have to say. No, I don't require a Book of Mormon. I had one given me during the war, but I never got around to reading it. I know nothing about your religion, really, although the person who gave me the book must have been of your faith. He said he'd been on a mission or something like that.... We didn't have time to talk much about it, and I'm afraid I was reluctant to discuss religion, so he didn't press the issue.... Yes, any day will suit me. Wednesday will be just fine, two-thirty. Thank you. Goodbye...." Barbara opened The Book of Mormon at the first chapter and began to read aloud to her son, "TI, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents."

Jennie, wheeling the new car homeward, in the South Temple Street traffic, felt the change in the weather. She looked with love on the leaves flowing past her from the flaming trees. The year was a river rushing toward the white silences. She snuggled under the soothing mink of her collar and touched her bright hair carefully. What would Rex say to the new color? Laugh probably, with the lines raying out from the corners of his eyes. Rex was maturing in such a charming way, even his graying hair was an advantage against his glowing tan. But of course, thirty-five was not elderly, to say the least. Jennie looked at her watch. Sabra's birthday! The cake not frosted, the ten candles not 24 bought, and here it was five already! How the afternoon melted when the girls all got together. In all the feverish feminine chatter everyone seemed to forget that they would all be together again in just five hours at still another party. Jennie hurried the gas pedal and raced for her own driveway. She shivered when she saw the house. She still could not overcome her delight in its newness and beauty. She stood for a moment on the curved brick walk to enjoy the smooth good looks of the place. Oh, she was the lucky one... She, Jennie Starr, was one of the lucky women in America.... Let the headlines wave black banners... Let the far-off tumults shout from the television screens... Let the riots and the seething mistrust rise and fall she, Jennie Starr, had a sanctuary for herself and her family. She lived in a fortress on this lovely 'street on this October day. Whatever the morrow might bring, today this beautiful four-bedroom, two-bath house, with a family room and a family, was hers. All the charming people inside were hers, from Rex the tall, to Johnnie the newest. Jennie ran up the stairs out of the crisp cold and flung open the door. "I'm home, my darlings!" The shout of welcome came simultaneously with their catapulting bodies. "Did you bring me a s'prize?"' demanded Lora, and _ without waiting, "Look, what we have!" Jennie looked cautiously and kept herself from leaping on a chair with an effort. 'Darling, mouses belong outdoors."' "Mice," corrected Lance gravely, "and besides, Mother, this is white and you buy them at the store." "All mice," said Jennie firmly, "white or brown, store or otherwise out out!" Lora looked at her in disappointment. "It will die," she said, "do you want it to die?'' "It sure will die,' echoed Lance, "and it cost me a dollar and a half." Johnny puffed from the kitchen. His diapers dragged and he clutched a toothbrush in one hand. Lance put in quickly, "The new baby sitter is real good." Jennie examined 'the toothbrush. She looked at Lance questioningly. He nodded. "I think so. I heard him in the downstairs bathroom." Jennie sighed and confiscated the toothbrush. The new baby sitter came in from the kitchen. Jennie made a mental note of the red ring on WHEAT FOR THE WISE the rosy cheek, caused by the telephone. "They were real good, Mrs. Starr. I didn't have a bit of trouble." "Thank you, Ann Frieda." Jennie fished in her purse for money. She lifted her head, suddenly aware. ''Where is Sabra?" The children looked about and absently counted each other. Ann Frieda flushed to her hairline. "She went out, Mrs. Starr she said it was just for a minute." "But I told you she was to stay in bed her throat. She couldn't even have a party because she was so ill." Lance said quickly, ""You know how people let Sabra have her way, Mother. Ill go find her." "I'm so sorry, Mrs. Starr." "Was Sabra bad?' asked Lora incredulously. "No!" Jennie stopped and bit her lip. "Sabrais Sabra absent-minded. She _ wouldn't mean not to obey... She just forgets." Ann Frieda vanished in a great breath of relief at being done with the afternoon. Lance went off like a rocket to look for Sabra. Lora took the candy bar surprise and went back to her room and the paper dolls. Jennie picked Johnny up and took him to the downstairs bedroom to take care of him. Then she washed her hands, and ploughed her way back to the kitchen. She must look for another sitter. The birthday cake she had baked that morning waited for frosting. Jennie pushed John into the high chair, searched for sugar. 25 FEBRUARY 1966 The windows above the sink looked out into the back garden. As Jennie watched, Sabra came through the trees. The place had -been an orchard before the house was built, and Jennie had pleaded that all the trees possible be left untouched. The departing sun had left something of splendor in the air, and it clung in gold light to Sabra's smooth dark hair. Jennie leaned against the sink, the thin sword of love and fear running through her chest. Without her sweater as well... And walking so slowly through the chill... Would the child never learn? What did she find to think about in all the hours she hoarded to herself? Jennie looked at her daughter with troubled eyes. How could a child be one's own and yet be a stranger? Sabra was too thin like a small wraith against the trees. Her long hair lifted on the wind, glossy and glowing, combed back from her forehead and kept in place by a band. Sabra's forehead was high and clear and her eyes, Jennie sensed, were gatherers of beauty and that was why they had the changing colors. They took the shine from whatever they looked upon, hills or water or skies. "Sabra!"' Jennie went to the door and called the name sharply. Sabra looked up and smiled. "Mother... How beautiful you are." Jennie took a step backward. Sabra was the only one of the children who had noticed her hair. Sabra broke into a leaping run. Jennie knew it was the new hair color that drew her and not her harsh command. 26 Sabra put her fingers lightly on Jennie's hair and on her cheeks, as if sight were not enough and she must, through fingertips, draw to her the essence of her mother. Jennie blinked fiercely. She held the bird arms in her cupped palms. Cold... The child was frozen. "How is your throat? Let me see." Sabra obediently opened her mouth. Jennie groaned, sighting the angry red. Sabra pulled away. "Oh, mother, the loveliest thing happened to me today... The very loveliest " "How do you expect the penicillins to help you, when you deliberately go against them by getting chilled like this?' Jennie realized she was speaking in the high, hard voice she hated. She went on, "Your father and I pay good money for the doctor '.. We do everything in our power." | '"'Listen, Mother... I know it off by heart the whole whole thing." Jennie rolled her eyes skyward and went back to the mixing bowl. She braced herself to hear one of the interminable poems Sabra adored, or a new Brownie song that made her limp with its familiarity. "Are you listening, Mother?" "Umhm" Sabra planted her feet firmly apart. She looked out the windows. Jennie saw that tonight the eyes were darkly blue and too bright. *" *.. Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.'"' Jennie held the electric mixer silent in her hand. She looked at Sabra, and slow waves of pain went through her as the words, beloved and cherished of Sabra, fell from her lips and seemed to linger in the dusk. Sabra knew the Beatitudes to the end. "Where did you learn them?" Jenny asked stiffly. "Over at Jean's."' "Did they make you learn them?" She kept impatience from her voice with an effort. "No." Sabra was trying a back bend now. '"Jean's church gives them cards with pictures of martyrs and the what did you call them? Beatitudes?' "What made you memorize them?" Jennie asked slowly. "IT wanted to,' Sabra said, "Jean has a big picture of Jesus over her bed, and she told me he was the holiest one who ever lived. Is that true?"' She stopped in the act of another back bend. "What is holy?" Jennie bit her lip. ''Someone who is very good." "Blessed are the pure in heart," repeated Sabra carefully, '"'for they shall see God." She smiled at Jennie happily, ''That's the best one. That's the one I'm going to keep." Sabra went out of the room, and to Jennie it seemed the child drew with her all the softness and light of the fallen day. Jennie flipped the switch. The kitchen was immediately bright and glittering with chrome and copper. She browned pork chops and made sauce and rice and emptied frozen vegetables into steaming water. WHEAT FOR THE WISE Her mind was filled with memory and with apprehension— memory of that radiant moment when Sabra was first placed in her arms—apprehension and worry over Sabra's future. Even in the beginning a sacred ordinance had been denied. Sabra had not received her name in fast meeting before the saints assembled. She had been denied a father's blessing. Her early years had not been lighted by the gospel. The kitchen still seemed hollow with Sabra's going. Jennie chopped lettuce... "Blessed are the poor in spirit... For theirs is the kingdom of heaven." She looked quickly in the corner, she felt guilty, as if her father might be standing there. But then she saw it was because his chair was against the desk, the chair that she had chosen when they were dividing his things, because he had used it so often. So now she could feel him sitting there still, with his Book of Mormon and his Doctrine and Covenants and his far-off look, like Sabra's, that look of inward seeing. How the two of them would have got along... Like a house afire. Jennie felt ill. How her father would have looked at her a grandchild of his having to go to a neighbor's house to learn the Beatitudes. Jennie peeled the tomatoes. Her father, though, was so strict. He had thought there was a penalty for not teaching children. He had taught her... Oh, so carefully, but in the end she had married outside the Church. But she had loved Rex. When she saw him she knew there could 27 JANUARY 1966 never be anyone for her but Rex it didn't matter what he was only Rex. When one married outside the Church... It was only natural to put away the contentious things... As she had done. They didn't count. That is, one just didn't think about those things any more that is when one's father died, and there was no one to remind and help. "Blessed are the poor in spired She heard Rex's car in the drive and, in a moment, he came charging in, filling the house with his own brand of electricity. He stopped on the _ threshold when he saw her and made a great thing of covering his eyes when he looked at her hair. He pretended to grope his way to her, "I'm blind... All that brightness. I can't see anything! What did they put on you? Lady Carolee's Sunburst or Lavender Lightning?" "You don't like it?" "Sometimes I feel wistful for the old days when ladies bought hats instead of hair but then I'm a reactionary." But he was laughing at her... As he loved to do, rejoicing in her femininity and her pretty follies. 'You dazzle me, darling!'"' He took her in his arms and hugged her with a great and joyous energy. "Peter Mills saw all you ladies having lunch at the Roof today. He said you looked like a convention of possums." "You mean the minks?" His grin teased her. "Now that everybody has one where are the status symbols?" "Joan's is newer.. Jacket.". And a 28 He came over to peer at the cake and to run his finger expertly around the frosting bowl. "Put the music box in?" "Yes, I did." He went over to Johnnie who was beginning to make sounds, lifted him out. '"He's wet.' "Your turn." "Q. K. Where are the others?" "Sabra was out this afternoon after I told her." He stopped short, his brows together, "What was the baby sitter doing?" "She's new. Understand Sabra." "She didn't have to understand her... Just keep her inside. Did I tell you what Sabra's temperature was last night?" "It was 104. She scares me." she doesn't Sabra came into the kitchen. She had put on her nightgown and slippers. She leaned against her father. "Why did you go out?" he demanded. Jennie hurried to mute the anger. ""Your father was worried about you." But Sabra looked at him without fear. 'I went over to see if I knew all the words... And I did."' She snuggled against him. "Jean said I could belong to her church... Since I didn't have one of my own." "You what?" Rex's voice rose to a shout. He looked accusingly at Jennie. Jennie hesitated. There was the agreement she and Rex had made before their marriage, no religion ever. But Jennie looked at Sabra's thin face. Does a child rise up from a sick bed and go in search of words for which she has no need? What was it that Sabra had to have that sent her out in the chill October afternoon? Jennie shivered, remembering her father's warning, "A parent is culpable if a child grows up in ignorance." Culpable... Culpa... Mea culpa. Her father's assertion, "The spiritual hunger in man is God's own longing for his child." "What's going on?" Rex was on the verge of one of his angers. Placate him, said Jennie to herself, but instead she said directly, "Your daughter went to a neighbor to learn that which she was not allowed to learn at home." Rex glared, "With a whole new set of Encyclopedias! Come off it!" "Listen," said Sabra in her light, quick voice, "Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled." WHEAT FOR THE WISE Rex exchanged a glance with Jennie. He gave Sabra a swift pat, "Run along up to _ bed. We'll discuss this later." Jennie watched the child dance away. She looked at Rex. He was girding himself, she could tell it by looking at him. He was summoning all the logic and arguments and refutations. Jennie straightened her shoulders. She was stepping out on a tight rope. She felt the air under her, and the long fall if she stumbled. The pity of it was she had never taken tight-rope walking lessons. How did one, so foolish and so unready, guide herself and her family safely to the other side. There was no question in her mind as to what was required of her, Sabra had only brought it to the surface, the family need. "No," said Rex firmly. "We're getting along just fine."' "Are we?" asked Jennie. (To be continued) JANUARY Linnie F. Robinson January comes knocking at my door Where scattered fragments of the year remain, In tasks attempted or left undone.

Time can be described, and its various elements given individual significance; it can be said that time is a period, a duration, a point of passing, an allotted portion of days or years, or of infinity—thus are definitions given. Time for us here upon the earth is that interval between leaving the Father's "courts on high'' and returning home again. To the Latter-day Saint, time has a revealed and sacred meaning, for we have been given instruction on times past, our pre-existence; the present, our earth life; and the future judgments and glories. Now, at the time of the New Year, there comes a moment in the summation of days, a midnight time of turning, a forward view into the morning of the year, fresh and new, and waiting the inscription of thoughts and deeds, ideals, and accomplishments. It is in this moment between farewell and beginning, that we are impressed again with a blessing of great worth—our families—our ancestors and our posterity. Again we rejoice in the deep roots of the family tree, and in the beauty of the spreading branches—even the tremulous uncertainty of the newest twigs. In our home evenings, in presenting the gospel heritage to each other, it is well to remember that we are the inheritors of a great treasure of enlightenment; we are the keepers of the treasure; and we are they who must give its shining glory to our children. Recently, as part of a home evening presentation, each member of the family was asked to describe one of the ancestors, to tell where the loved one had been born, his appearance, and his occupation, how and when he became a member of the Church.

SAMARITAN Sylvia Probst Young You came in that dark hour of my grief, That hour of poignant loneliness and doubt, When hope's small candle suddenly burned out. You came—and was it strange | found relief In tender eyes that spoke your sympathy, And warming strength within your healing hand? | should have known that you would understand, For you have had your own Gethsemane. You had no words to give me, but instead You listened to my torn heart's longing cry, And shared my tears, | cannot wonder why Having you listen left me comforted. My faltering feet you guided—then we found A path of peace—a quiet vale of dawn, You gave me light when all my light was gone— By your solicitude my wounds were bound. 1 could not tell you then, but oh, my dear, God knew my need and surely sent you here. 33 The Blue Crystal Vase Betty Lou Martin Smith @ Elizabeth Kirk walked the length of her front porch to see if Mr. Jonas, the mailman, was on time. As usual, a woman could set her clock by him. Coming down the block at his steady gait, he waved ahead at Elizabeth. "Nice morning, Mrs. Kirk," he called in his cheerful way. "It looks as if we have a letter for you today." "Thank you, Mr. Jonas," Elizabeth said, as she reached for the envelope. "It is always nice to receive mail, especially when one is alone." Mr. Jonas smiled as he turned to leave. "Have a pleasant day, Mrs. Kirk." The comfortably warm May morning allowed Elizabeth to enjoy the pleasure of her front porch. She spent many lovely afternoons and evenings there, sipping lemonade and eating oatmeal cookies. Instantly Elizabeth recognized the handwriting of her daughter, Camille. She smiled to herself as she looked at the writing. It could hardly be called neat. Camille, the charming, warmhearted, gay one in the family had never been noted for her scholarly ambitions. She was a lovely young girl and had now grown into a lovely woman. Her daughter, Lisa, was a younger version of Camille in looks and personality. She, too, was blonde, blue-eyed, and charming; however there the similarity ended. She was noted for her scholastic record, and for her accuracy and speed in accomplishing whatever she set out to do. Elizabeth was proud of this mother and daughter, and she was happy to learn that Lisa, an only child, would be married in the fall to a young lawyer for 35 JANUARY 1966 whom she had been working during the past year. It was well known in the city that this young lawyer came from a very successful family that occupied an important place in the social life of the city. The letter lay on the porch swing beside Elizabeth, still unopened as her thoughts turned to Lisa. She hoped that being in such a prominent family would not change Lisa; she had been reared well, but her family could hardly be called wealthy in the material things of the world. Elizabeth carefully opened the letter: The last paragraph of the letter read: Lisa's fiance will be in the East on her birthday, and her father will be away on business, also. It is unfortunate but there is not any way that they will be able to change their plans. Therefore, Lisa and I thought that we would spend that week end with you. She feels that this will be the last time that she will be able to be with you for awhile. If this meets with your approval, and no other member of the family plans to visit you at this time, then we will come. Let me know as soon as you can. Love, Camille. Elizabeth, widowed for a number of years, was excited and happy. She went into the house and immediately answered Camille's letter. It would be pleasant to visit with Camille and Lisa again. It had been such a long time since they had spent a week end with her. Elizabeth gazed about the living room. She must busy herself cleaning before the arrival of Camille and Lisa. The sun cast warm rays about the room, making the worn spots in some of the older furniture 36 even more noticeable. It had been such a long time since Elizabeth had bought any new furniture. She smiled to herself. Somehow she couldn't make up her mind to trade the old furniture in on something new. Slowly Elizabeth walked over to the old china closet in the corner of the room. This she should clean first thing. All of the old dishes must be washed. Opening the glass door, Elizabeth reached inside and tenderly touched one or two of the dishes; then her hand rested upon a blue crystal vase. She picked it up and held it to her. Such a lovely vase, she thought. It had had a great deal of meaning in each of its past owners' lives. It was a wedding present to her Grandmother Daniels. How she had treasured it in her comfortable home in the East. The vase had had a special place upon the mantel, its color complementing the rest of the room. Elizabeth remembered her Grandmother telling her of their conversion to the Latter-day Saint faith. They had left their comforts and their successful life in the East to come to Zion. There just was not room enough to bring luxuries, only the necessities. When the time had come to leave, however, Elizabeth's Grandmother had decided to bring along the vase. Many times in their journey West, Grandmother Daniels had opened the dusty trunk, reached down to the bottom, and brought out the vase. It grew to be a symbol of hope for a bright and beautiful future with their newfound faith. As a child, Elizabeth recalled seeing the vase standing on the table in the modest living room of Grandma Daniels' home. Always when she did her cleaning, Grandmother Daniels would dust the vase first. After Grandma Daniels' death, Elizabeth's mother took the vase. How it had survived the hands of little children wanting to touch it, Elizabeth marveled. Finally, in desperation, Elizabeth's mother had put it above the reach of small hands. It was too much a part of the family to risk having it broken. Elizabeth wondered to whom she should pass on the vase. Carefully she put it back in its place in the closet and gently shut the door. The ensuing days went by a little too slowly for Elizabeth as she anticipated her daughter and granddaughter's visit. Then, at last, the day arrived, and Camille and Lisa were walking up the sidewalk to the old two-story home. "At last you're here!" Elizabeth hugged her kin affectionately. "I thought that the time would never come. I've been eounting the days. Why, you both look wonderful!" "Thank you, Mom. It's wonderful to see you, and you get prettier every day.'"' Camille still had her arms around her Mother. Lisa walked about the living room. "This room never changes, Grandma, and I hope that it never does. I love everything about it." Elizabeth smiled at the words of her granddaughter. "I'm afraid that it is quite old-fashioned, but I like it. And more THE BLUE CRYSTAL VASE important to me, it is just as your grandfather liked it." The evening was spent reminiscing over past days, some happy and some sad. All too soon Lisa yawned and excused herself. "It has been a long drive, Grandma, and I worked extra hard at the office so that I could leave early to drive here. I think that I'll turn in. Goodnight, both of you." Lisa kissed her mother and then her grandmother. "You should be extremely proud of your daughter, Camille; she is a fine, young woman." Elizabeth gently touched Camille's hand. Camille responded in her warm way. "I truly am, Mother. She has been such a good daughter. I only hope that she will be happy in her marriage. You must plan to come to their wedding. They will be married in the temple and then have a reception later on that evening. I hope that everything works out. We are trying to make some plans, and I must admit that I am bewildered already." "Now, don't start worrying; you know that things will work out just fine," Elizabeth reassured Camille. Camille walked to the edge of the porch and looked up at the stars blinking at her. It seemed to Elizabeth that they, too, responded to this lovely lady's warmth. "TI know things are going to be fine. It is just that the family she is marrying into is so socially conscious and proper that it wolries me." Elizabeth walked to her daughter's side. "Do you remember what I always told you when 37 JANUARY 1966 you were growing up? Just be yourself. People should not expect that you be any less or any more. I hope that Lisa will remember that." Camille's eyes met her mother's. "I am sure that she will. I don't think that this marriage will change her, but one never knows." "Oh, come now, Camille, you don't think that she has changed, do you?" Elizabeth questioned. Camille suddenly changed the subject in her known fashion. "It seems like only yesterday that she was born, and, just think, Sunday she will be twenty-one years old. Where does the time go, Mother?" "T don't know, Camille. It seems only yesterday that you were a little girl yourself. I can still see you running into the house excitedly from school with some earth-shaking news to tell me, or trying to beat your older brothers and sister out of the frosting bowl."' Elizabeth paused. "You see, my dear, this house is full of memories. I will be standing at the kitchen sink doing my dishes, and I can almost hear your Father's footsteps coming up the walk and his calling out, 'I'm home; where's my family?' " Elizabeth's voice suddenly became choked. It was more than she could bear to go over the past. It seemed so much a part of her present. "Let's go in now, Mother. It is getting chilly out here."' Camille sensed her mother's mood and took her by the hand. In the middle of the night when Lisa and Camille were asleep, Elizabeth tried to plan Lisa's birthday celebration. She 38 expecially wanted it to be pleasant for her granddaughter before they had to return to the city. They would start out the day with Sunday School and return home to a birthday dinner. I should give her a present, Elizabeth mused, but what could it be? I don't have the money to buy her anything elaborate, and I do so want to give her something which she will like. Pll have to find something tomorrow. Elizabeth dropped off to sleep. "Can't anyone ever get up before you do? I thought that you would sleep in this morning, Lisa." Elizabeth walked down the stairs to see her granddaughter admiring her dishes in the old china closet. Lisa turned to her grandmother. "I had such a wonderful rest last night, that I couldn't stay in bed another minute. There is just something about this country air." Elizabeth made her way to the kitchen. "Well, I'll have breakfast ready in a moment. I see your mother is still a late sleeper. I guess that we will have to eat without her." "May I help you, Grandma?" Lisa followed her grandmother into the kitchen. "No dear, but you can sit down and talk to me." The early morning light reflected upon Lisa's skin, making it appear almost transparent. ""You know, Grandmother, your dishes are just beautiful. I'll bet they mean a great deal to you." "You are right, my dear. Some of them belonged to your Greatgrandmother, and many of them were wedding gifts. They are beautiful." Elizabeth loved her pretty dishes, and she was always ready to show them off. "I am especially fond of the blue crystal vase you have. It is so elegant. It is almost too beautiful to touch," Lisa praised. "Oh, that is my favorite, too, Lisa. It belonged to my mother and to my grandmother. They both guarded it diligently. I was so pleased when my mother wanted me to have it." The rest of the day was spent leisurely with mother, daughter, and granddaughter going into town and meeting old acquaintances. Elizabeth still couldn't find anything that she felt was suitable for Lisa. She bought her a birthday card with a meaningful verse; however, none of the items that she looked at appealed to her. She did so want to give Lisa a gift. She would just have to find an appropriate present. Sunday bloomed bright and clear, and Elizabeth arose a few minutes earlier. She dressed carefully into her best dress, and slipped a cobbler apron over it so as not to soil it while she prepared breakfast. She walked to the dresser and gave her hair a last-minute touch here and there. Silently she went down the stairs. Camille and Lisa were still sleeping. She hoped with all her heart that Lisa would like the gift that she had chosen for her. Elizabeth had qualms about it as_ she wrapped the package beautifully. Maybe it wouldn't be good enough to put in Lisa's new home. I could just give her the card, Elizabeth rationalized. Lisa would understand her position. Elizabeth added the finishing touches to the package just in THE BLUE CRYSTAL VASE time. She could hear Lisa stirring in her room. "Grandmother, dinner was just scrumptious, and Sunday School gave me such a good feeling. The day has been one I'll always remember." Lisa pushed herself away from the table. "I am so glad that we decided to come. It would have been a_ lonesome birthday with Jack in the East and Daddy away also." "T hate the week end to come to an end, Lisa. You don't know what it has meant to me to have you and your mother here," Elizabeth expressed herself. "Oh, I have a little gift for you, my dear. I wish that it could be more.". Going to the buffet, Elizabeth reached inside and brought out the package wrapped in different shades of rose and handed it to Lisa. Slowly Lisa opened the present and then exclaimed. "Oh, Grandma, the blue crystal vase! I could never accept it!" Elizabeth felt herself sinking inside as she slumped into a chair, Lisa had changed after all. She 39 JANUARY 1966 didn't want the gift. It was not good enough now. When she had been a little girl, she had always been so grateful for the least little show of affection. Elizabeth let her thoughts run rampant. "Mother, you shouldn't have," Elizabeth heard Camille saying as if she were somewhere in the distance. Lisa rose from her chair and walked over to Elizabeth, kneeling before the older woman. "Grandma, I couldn't take this beautiful possession from you. I know how much it is treasured by you, and how much you hold it dear." "Lisa!" Tears appeared in Elizabeth's eyes. "I wanted you to have it. I know that it won't compare with the gifts that you will receive at your wedding...." "Oh, Grandma, it couldn't be compared with the other gifts. It will be far superior to them. I have always wanted that vase, ever since I was a little girl, but I never dared hope that it would ever be mine. It will have a special place on the mantel in our new home for all to admire. You will see it, too, when you come to visit us." "Well," Camille said, "how do you like that? I have always wanted that vase, too." She laughed. ''But I am thrilled that you gave it to Lisa." The sharp ring of the telephone pierced the atmosphere. "That must be Jack; he was going to call me here at three o'clock. I can hardly wait to tell him about the vase." Camille walked over to the table and picked up the vase. "Mother, if this vase could only talk, it could tell quite a story, couldn't it?" Elizabeth stood by her daughter. "It is telling a story, Camille. Why do you think that it appears more beautiful as the years go on?" Camille held the vase up, and it seemed to reflect even more brilliantly than before. It did indeed have a story to tell, this blue crystal vase.

The quilt can be entirely machine sewed. It is warm, but light in weight, and can be machine washed. Children find the quilt convenient to take outdoors for use when they are sitting on the lawn. It also makes a "cushiony'' mat for the floor when children are playing or watching television. Make 8"' x 8" squares from old sheets or other washed cotton material. Fold each square from corner to corner to make a triangle. Cut a nylon stocking down the back and fold and fit it into each triangle. Stitch the triangle by machine along the edges and down the middle. Do not turn in the edges of the padded triangle. Make a square by stitching four triangles together, lapping the thin edges on the machine. You may use a zig-zag stitch or a plain stitch for this. Then stitch into strips of as many squares as you need for the desired size of quilt. (Five strips of six squares each will make a quilt 40''x48''.) To cover the quilt, lay flat on the table a piece of new material or used material double the size of the desired quilt, with small allowances for turned in edges. Lay the padded strips, which have been stitched together into one piece, on one half of the covering material. Fold over the other half, and pin the edges. Mark a pattern (a series of rectangles in graduating sizes, or any design desired) on the quilt and stitch the pattern on the machine, or by hand, if preferred. Turn in the edges and finish with stitching. The quilt makes an acceptable gift for a baby shower or for a child's birthday. Bath mats can be made in a similar way, by using toweling for the cover. Ties of yarn or colored heavy crochet cotton could be used for attaching the cover of the mat, since the toweling might be too heavy to stitch on the machine. If preferred, the ''quilting'' for the mat could be done by hand. 8" 8" lay stocking in lower half make 4 of these fold over and stitch triangles into a square 44 A "QUICK" QUILT FOR A CHILD'S BED make strip of these squares to _ required size—all by machine BS Stitch pattern when covered RESPITE Rowena Jensen Bills Restlessly | wandered where the mountain Skims the sky, Heard the echo of my loneliness in Soft winds passing by, Felt the well-deep crush of heartache From a last goodbye, Then in the hush of memory | hid My face to cry.

You will also find it in the produce section of your market, where it comes from farms which grow it commercially. This peppery-tasting and many-leaved plant adds zest to salads and hors d'oeuvres. It also adds to the nutrition in the diet because it is very rich in minerals, and particularly high in vitamins A and C. The people of the past, the Persians, Greeks, Romans, and Chinese recognized this plant as an important part of their diets. They knew that it improved their health, but they didn't analyze it in terms of vitamins or minerals. The Chinese make a delicious soup using watercress. It is a light and appetizing prelude to a meal. Watercress Soup—Chinese Style Prepare 1 c. Watercress. This is the only time-consuming part of the whole process, but well worth it. Wash the watercress thoroughly, take off the leaves, save some of the stems if you like, to chop up and sprinkle in a green salad. Set aside the leaves in the refrigerator. Heat one quart chicken stock and add 2 or 3 chopped green onions. While the stock is simmering, beat two eggs plus two tbsp. Water. Add the egg mixture while the chicken stock is boiling. The egg will form in strings (as you have seen in Chinese soups in the restaurants). Remove from the fire as soon as the egg strings seem firm. Now remove the watercress leaves from the refrigerator and chop them. Add the watercress the last minute when you are ready to serve. Let the family or guests add their seasonings to taste. Remember the watercress is quite peppery in flavor. A dash of nutmeg is appetizing, also. 46 Catherine B. Pratt Finds Many Uses for Greeting Cards Catherine 'Billeter Pratt, who was born in Zurich, Switzerland, was brought by her parents to Utah in 1884, when she was two years old. She married William Parker Pratt, grandson of Parley P. Pratt, and they became the parents of fifteen children. There are now forty-four grandchildren, thirty-five greatgrandchildren, as well as many step-grandchildren and step-great-grandchildren. Over the years, Mrs. Pratt has received thousands of beautiful greeting cards—for her birthdays, for Christmas, for Valentine's Day, Easter, Mother's Day, and other occasions. Finding these cards ''too beautiful to throw away," Mrs. Pratt has made colorful scrapbooks for children, especially for children's hospitals; and she has included greeting cards with special messages in Books of Remembrance, in family histories, and in photograph albums. She finds her "happy hobby'' to be inexpensive, interesting, and important to herself, her family, and to her many friends. Her hobby is a way of keeping the time and the people and the places that might be lost or forgotten otherwise... A way of/remembering words of encouragement and friendship to mark the years and the seasons of a long and lovely life. Mrs. Pratt loves to write and read poetry, and she especially loves the poetry which appears in The Relief Society Magazine. She has been a member of the Tabernacle Choir and has served many years as a Relief Society visiting teacher. ''My main hobby is people,'' she says, ''and | believe that if we do the best we can, the Lord meets us halfway." 47 OUR LITTLE Helen M. Peterson @ "It is simply impossible to save money these days!" I heard one young woman tell another, recently. "Everything costs so much!" she said. This mother told about giving her children modest allowances. Her fouryear-old received fifty cents a week; the three school-age youngsters each received one dollar a week. I listened to the two young mothers discussing the issue, but my thoughts drifted back to when money was scarce indeed, and the only way we could build up a "little nest egg" was to save one penny at a time. It was during the depression days. Father's income was very meager. Every cent he earned was desperately needed to buy necessities for everyday living; yet mother insisted we must save something for a rainy day. A day when an emergency might 48 arise and we would need available cash to meet the situation. So it was that we were encouraged to eke out a penny, a nickle, or a dime, whenever we could, and store it away in a little tin cup. Mother let us children take turns dropping coins into the little tin cup. We kept track of the money. Pennies were exchanged for dimes; dimes were exchanged for dollars. Slowly, but eventually, dollar bills turned into fives. When emergencies arose—and they did as they do in all households—the money saved came in very handy. Like the time Reggie fell and skinned his knee coming home from school. Normally, Mom would clean the injured skin—in this case the knee —with alcohol, put on a sterile dressing, and the wound would heal with no complications. But Reggie's knee didn't heal. Infection set in. The doctor bill, plus medications, came to over sixty dollars, and we were all glad that our nest egg had enough money to meet the obligation. Mostly the unexpected emergencies which arose were illnesses of some kind, but there were times when situations arose which called for a family council to decide whether or not the situation was important enough to be considered an emergency, and merited taking money from "our little nest egg'' to meet the expenses. I remember the day Julie came home and said, 'Mom, I won first in the 'Declam Contest' today, and I'm eligible to enter the regional contest.'"' There was no dissent among the family to take needed cash from the tin cup to pay for Julie's lunch and bus fare, for the contest was held! In a hearby city and didn't cost much. And when Julie won the regional and was eligible to enter the district contest seventy miles distant, all agreed that the few dollars needed to cover expenses could be taken from "'the nest egg." When Julie came. Home from the district contest, wearing the OUR LITTLE NEST EGG blue ribbon, and stating that now she' was eligible for the state contest, we were all very proud of her, indeed. Although the state contest was being held 300 miles away, Julie's expenses were quite nominal, for contestants were given a special rate for transportation and lodging. Now, there was no question of where the money was coming from to send Julie to that state contest. This was an emergency—and we had saved toward it. Two days before the planned departure for the state contest, Julie came home from school in tears. She had heard that all the other contestants were being accompanied by their mothers. That was the first time our "little nest egg'' was emptied to meet an emergency other than sickness. When Mother and Julie returned from the state contest, and Julie had won first in the declaration contest, we were all very proud that we, in a small way, had been a part of it. Many times, over the years, our coffer was emptied, and temporarily our feeling of security would wane, but always we started right over again saving our pennies so that we'd have a "'little nest egg"? To meet an emergency which might arise. ACROSS THE MILES Gladys Hesser Burnham Across the miles our handclasp would reach out In friendship that has lasted through the years.

Standing at the back: Zilla Hess and Jane Hess, Belmont Ward. Olive W. Durfey, President, Bear River Stake Relief Society, reports: "The Bear River Stake Relief Society honored the visiting teachers at a joint convention and Singing Mothers concert March 27, 1965. The program started with the reading of an original tribute by Lawonza Wassom. Special honors and beautiful corsages were presented to four visiting teachers (as pictured above) with the outstanding records of fifty years each, or 200 years of faithful service in that capacity. All other visiting teachers of the stake were presented with an inscribed ballpoint pen. "The lovely musical program 'A Singing Mother Sings' was arranged under the leadership of President Durfey and her Counselors Effie Potter and Anna Durfey, and music directors Lucretia Rhodes and Rennis Larkin. Jeanine Kent was narrator of the spiritual script written by President Durfey. The Singing Mothers chorus, composed of singers from each of the nine wards, consisted of 125 members. Each number was introduced by an original script. A piano solo 'Fantasie Impromptu,' by Chopin, was played by Marilyn Johnson during the interlude of the program." 51 JANUARY 1966 Holladay Stake (Salt Lake City, Utah), Third Ward Relief Society Honors Visiting Teachers at Luncheon Party June 2, 1965 Selma Wall (at left), eldest visiting teacher, presented with gift by Diane F.

Folsom, President, Holladay Stake Relief Society, reports: "Visiting teachers of the Holladay Third Ward Relief Society, who had achieved a perfect record of visiting all of the homes for the past two years, were honored at a luncheon party. The youngest visiting teacher, Diane F. Emery, age nineteen, presented a gift to Sister Wall in behalf of the organization. More than half of the visiting teachers received special awards because they did not miss one month of teaching the entire year."

Sister Kutschke reports: "The spirit of our first Relief Society Mission Conference was wonderful, and all returned to their branches with a feeling of gratitude for the Priesthood and the blessings of Relief Society, and with a greater determination to improve their organizations and help to bring others into activity. The theme of the conference was 'Strengthen the ties that bind us together.' "The Relief Society chorus, under the direction of Christina C. Van Hulten, furnished the music for the first session. Martha Otto was honored as being the eldest Relief Society sister, having been a member for forty years; and Marta Tobeck was honored as the youngest, having been a member fourteen days. Many lovely handmade articles were on display, and some were demonstrated. The Diisseldorf Branch displayed their first quilt, which was also the first one made by Relief Society in the mission. Of interest, also, was the style show, with lovely dresses and children's clothing, as well as a great variety of aprons. The film 'The Awakening' was shown, and the conference ended with a fine spiritual testimony meeting." Sister Benson comments: "Last Sunday (Aug. 30) was a great day in our mission. We had our first two new buildings dedicated. The sisters are thrilled with their new Relief Society rooms."

Hilda Halverson reports: "Following the December 1964 work meeting lesson, "Personal Appearance and Its Influence on Happiness," a stake-wide dressmaking project was launched. All nine of the Relief Societies in our stake participated in this dressmaking project with enthusiasm. Forty-two sisters in the Uintah Ward made dresses, and, although this was not the largest number of dresses made in a ward, it was the greatest percentage of Relief Society members, because Uintah is the smallest ward in our stake. "The purpose of the project was to insure that the sisters became acquainted with the rudiments of basic sewing, and to add a new, attractive dress to each sister's wardrobe. Dresses were worn and modeled in the April work meetings."

Five branches, representing three islands, united to make this possible: Rarotonga (Avarua, Ngatangiia, and Arorangi Branches), Aitutaki, and Mangaia. "A wide assortment of articles was attractively displayed, including quilts, feather fans, mats, children's clothing, cushions, aprons, native baskets, brooms, and assorted foods. The bazaar was a complete sell-out, and we collected approximately $280, which was excellent for our mission. Almost all of the proceeds were eagerly turned over for the beautiful new Arorangi chapel, which has just been completed. Everyone was delighted with the success of the bazaar, and a spirit of true sisterhood prevailed." 56 Elder Roy W. Doxey Lesson 71 — The Word of Wisdom — A Life-Giving Revelation (Text: Doctrine and Covenants, Section 89:4-21) For First Meeting, April 1966 In the Southern Hemisphere, for September 1966 Objective: To recognize the prophetic element in the Word of Wisdom, understand its positive teachings and appreciate the spiritual blessings available to the individual who keeps the commandments therein. BACKGROUND Section 89, known as the Word of Wisdom, was received in 1833 as a revelation from God. The Lord gave his people counsel in this revelation that they might not be deceived by the adversary. It has been demonstrated by science that alcohol, tobacco, tea, and coffee are not good for man, as stated by the Lord. The Word of Wisdom is prophetic in revealing that "conspiring men" will seek to deceive mankind. The literal fulfillment of this prophecy further confirms Joseph Smith as a prophet of the Lord. A NOTABLE PROPHECY In order to prevent the Latterday Saints from being deceived, the Lord forewarned them against the wiles of men. Specifically given in the revelation on the 58 Word of Wisdom is the following prophecy of the last days: — Behold, verily, thus saith the Lord unto you: In consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days, I have warned you, and forewarn you, by giving unto you this word of wisdom by revelation (D&C 89:4). President David O. McKay describes some of the methods that are used to deceive mankind: "Evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men. " The purport of that impressed me in the twenties and the thirties of this century. I just ask you men tonight to recall the methods employed by certain tobacco interests to induce women to smoke cigarettes. You remember how _insidiously they launched their plan. First, by saying that it would reduce weight. They had a slogan: "Take a cigarette instead of a sweet." Later, some of us who like the theatre, noticed that they would have a young lady light the gentleman's cigarette. Following this a woman's hand would be shown on billboards lighting or taking a cigarette. A year or two passed and soon they were brazen enough to show the lady on the screen or on the billboard smoking a cigarette. I find here a clipping which I set aside in the early thirties, which corroborates this idea. This is 1931: "It is well known that the cigarette manufacturers are after the young women and girls, now. They say there are twenty-five million of these in the United States, and if they can popularize smoking among them, they will be able to increase their sales from three billion, six hundred million dollars annually to six billion dollars. This is their claim and their aim." Now, it is common to see beautiful young women depicted on billboards, and in the popular journals advertising certain brands of cigarettes. "Last year three of the large cigarette manufacturers, we are informed, spent fifty-four million dollars in advertising their wares. This is probably a greater outlay than has ever before been spent to popularize any kind of merchandise...." I may be wrong, but I thought I saw an indication recently that conspiring men now have evil designs upon our youth. Keep your eyes and ears open, to observe if they are not taking the same steps now to get our young men as they did to entice women to use that vile weed (Conference Report, October 1948, pp. 185- 186).; TOBACCO — ITS EFFECTS In the Word of Wisdom the Lord said this about tobacco: And again, tobacco is not for the body, neither for the belly, and is not good for man, but is an herb for LESSON DEPARTMENT bruises and all sick cattle, to be used with judgment and skill (D&C 89:8). That tobacco is not good for man has been demonstrated in many ways both in the laboratory and in the lives of individuals. Since much publicity has been given to the high incidence of lung cancer to cigarette smoking, a controversy has raged between the tobacco industry and public agencies over the cause of lung cancer. Studies, however, have disclosed that the risk of lung cancer is greatly increased by cigarette smoking. WINE OR STRONG DRINK In the Word of Wisdom the Lord condemns the use of alcohol, as follows: That inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong drink among you, behold it is not good, neither meet in the sight of your Father, only in assembling yourselves together to offer up your sacraments before him. And, behold, this should be wine, yea, pure wine of the grape of the vine, of your own make (D&C 89:5-6). In an earlier revelation, the Lord instructed the Prophet Joseph Smith by an angel that wine was unnecessary in the sacrament, but any liquid could be used as long as it was done with an eye single to the glory of God. (Ibid., 27:2-4.) Water is used as a sacramental emblem today in the Church. From the beginning of this dispensation to the present, drunkenness and the use of alcohol, except for medicinal purposes, have been condemned by the prophets. An impressive thought in connection with the Word of Wisdom and moderate drinking is given by President McKay in these words: 59 JANUARY 1966.. - I am glad when I study this passage, to find that the Lord did not say, "Strong drink to excess is not good;" nor "Drunkenness is not good." Suppose he had weakened that expression by modifying it and saying, "Strong drink in excess, or when taken in large quantities, is not good," how soon we should have justified ourselves that a little drink is good. But like other eternal truths it stands un-. Qualified; "strong drink is not good" (Conference Report, April 1911, page 62). Parents who, even though observing the Word of Wisdom themselves, serve alcoholic beverages to guests in their homes, are subjecting their children to influences which adversely affect their attitudes. We are reminded of the counsel of President George Albert Smith not to step over into the devil's territory. HOT DRINKS The Word of Wisdom does not use the words tea and coffee, yet Latter-day Samts have been instructed that "hot drinks" used in verse 9 of section 89, refers to these beverages. Hyrum Smith, the brother of the Prophet, in a sermon of May 29, 1842, made such a definition. And again, "hot drinks are not for the body, or belly;" there are many who wonder what this can mean; whether it refers to tea or coffee, or not. I say it does refer to tea, and coffee (Times and Seasons, Vol. III, page 800). President Brigham Young on October 30, 1870 said:.:. I have heard it argued that tea and coffee are not mentioned therein; that is very true; but what were the people in the habit of taking as hot drinks when that revelation was given? Tea and coffee. We were not in the habit of drinking water very hot, but tea and coffee — the beverages in common use (Journal of Discourses 13:277). "WHOLESOME HERBS" In addition to specifying certain harmful products that man should not partake of, the revelation advises the use of grains, vegetables, fruits, and meat sparingly. It also mentions certain grains for the use of animals. These are known as the positive aspects of the Word of Wisdom. In these words, we find counsel: And again, verily I say unto you, all wholesome herbs God hath ordained for the constitution, nature, and use of man — | Every herb in the season thereof, and every fruit in the season thereof; all these to be used with prudence and thanksgiving (D&C 89:10-11). It has been pointed out that "wholesome herbs" as used in Joseph Smith's day meant all plants and vegetables. "IN THE SEASON THEREOF" Some few readers of the Word of Wisdom assume that because herbs and fruits should be eaten "in the season thereof'? Modern methods of food preservation are disapproved. It is true that fruits should be eaten when ripe and vegetables when mature to obtain the most nutrition from them, but it is neither logical nor scientific to maintain that they should not be used at a time when they are not available in the fresh state if they are properly preserved. MEAT IS ORDAINED FOR MAN Yea, flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of the air, I, the Lord, have ordained for the use of man with thanksgiving; nevertheless they are to be used sparingly; And it is pleasing unto me that they should not be used, only in times of winter, or of cold, or famine. All grain is ordained for the use of man and of beasts, to be the staff of life, not only for man but for the beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven, and all wild animals that run or creep on the earth; And these hath God made for the use of man only in times of famine and excess of hunger (D&C 89: 12-15). Two years before this revelation was received the Lord said to forbid meat on religious grounds was not of him. Moreover, beasts and fowls were provided for man's food and raiment, but man was not to waste animal life by wanton killing. (Jbid., 49:18-21.) WHEAT FOR MAN Wheat is not the only grain for man, but it is the best, according to the Word of Wisdom. All grain is good for the food of man; as also the fruit of the vine; that which yieldeth fruit, whether in the ground or above the ground—Nevertheless, wheat for man... (D&C 89: 16-17). Wheat has long been recognized by man as a good food, and nutritional science has found that this grain will promote bodily strength, greater resistance against infections, freedom from many deficiency and degenerative diseases, and endurance. ANIMAL FOODS Section 89 recommends that certain grains are of greater value to some animals than to others..-. And corn for the ox, and oats for the horse, and rye for the fowls and for swine, and for all beasts of the field, and barley for all useful animals, and for mild drinks, as also other grain (D&C 89:17). "AND ALL SAINTS WHO REMEMBER " The saints who remember to keep the commandments, includLESSON DEPARTMENT ing the Word of Wisdom, are promised that they will receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones. (D&C 89:18.) The two expressions, "health in their navel and marrow to their bones," are meaningful in the light of present-day knowledge. The unborn baby is nourished and may also be_ poisoned through the navel or umbilicus. Bone marrow manufactures the various blood cells needed for health. WALKING OBEDIENTLY There have been some who | have thought that by obediently living the Word of Wisdom the blessings promised in that revelation would come. It is true that if one lives a law, such as a health law, the benefits of fulfilling that law will be realized. On the other hand, the Latter-day Saint who lives the Word of Wisdom cannot expect to receive all of the promised blessings— hidden treasures of knowledge, wisdom, spirituality, and the destroying angel to pass them by —if he does not abide the other commandments. (D&C 89:18.) The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that though an individual fulfill one commandment and neglect others he will not receive salvation. I spoke to the people, showing them that to get salvation we must not only do some things, but everything which God has commanded.... It mattereth not whether the principle is popular or unpopular, I will always maintain a true principle, even if I stand alone in it (DHC VI:223). One of the distressing facts about breaking the Word of Wisdom by smoking and drinking alcoholic beverages, is the 61 JANUARY 1966 effect it has on the individual, the home, and society. The First Presidency (President Heber J. Grant, J. Reuben Clark, Jr., David O. McKay) in their message of October 1942, made the following accusations against liquor: Drink brings cruelty into the home; it walks arm in arm with poverty; its companions are disease and plague; it puts chastity to flight; and it knows neither honesty nor fair dealing; it is a total stranger to truth; it drowns conscience; it is the bodyguard of evil; it curses all who touch it. Drink has brought more woe and misery, broken more hearts, wrecked more homes, committed more crimes, filled more coffins, than all the wars the world has suffered (Conference Report, October 1942, page 8.) President Grant drew attention to the consequences of young people breaking the Word of Wisdom, and then showed how frequently this kind of disobedience leads to far more serious sin. I want it understood — that the use of liquor and tobacco is one of the chief means in the hands of the adversary whereby he is enabled to lead boys and girls from virtue. Nearly always those who lose their virtue, first partake of those things that excite passions within them or lower their resistance and_ becloud their minds. Partaking of tobacco and liquor is calculated to make them a prey to those things which, if indulged in, are worse than death itself (Gospel Standards, page 55). Elder Mark E. Petersen of the Council of the Twelve also pointed out the destructive influence of the cigarette in the life of the member of the Church. He declared that there is the feeling of uncomfortableness in being with people who don't smoke, so the smoker finds other people than those at Church with whom to associate. Since smoking is against one of the commandments and the smoker doesn't like to hear about the Word of Wisdom, he begins staying away from his Church meetings. These things lead to forgetting about praying and paying tithing. When the time comes to choose a life's companion the chances are that it will be someone in the smoking crowd. In other words, the cigarette has helped select the marriage partner. When the children arrive in the home, it is not likely that they will be taught to pray, go to Church, pay tithing, etc., because the parents are indifferent to these opportunities. (Conference Report, April 1948, pp. 152-56.) Disobedience to the commandments brings loss of the Holy Ghost, and the living of the commandments gives one that Spirit with all of its blessings against being deceived. "HIDDEN TREASURES" The Holy Ghost and the gifts which come from that Spirit will enlighten and give knowledge, protection, wisdom, peace and joy. These are some of the promised blessings of keeping the commandments. Here is what the Lord said: And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures; and shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint (D&C 89: 19-20). ' What is the greatest treasure that one may have in this life to assist him on the road to exaltation? Knowledge that saves! ([bid.,.131:6; 1380:18-19.) In addition to knowing the principles of salvation, there is the important "hidden treasure" of knowing by the Holy Ghost that God lives, Jesus Christ is the Savior, that Joseph Smith is God's Prophet, and his successors are also holders of the keys of the Priesthood. Finally, the Lord promises that the destroying angel shall pass by the saints and not slay them, as he promised ancient Israel. (D&C 89:21; Exodus 12: 12-13, 29-30.) This promise does not mean that death will not come to the obedient. It is in the eternal plan that death comes to all. However, death may be bitter or sweet. (D&C 42:45-47.) He who has walked in obedience to the commandments shall receive the blessings of the angel of life—peace, mercy, hope, love, and to open the door of light and eternal life with its everlasting joys. (Conference Report, April 1925, pp. 61-62.) The First Presidency in 1943 LESSON DEPARTMENT with reference to the Word of Wisdom, wrote: This declares the divine wisdom. It is God's law of health, and is binding upon each and everyone of us. We cannot escape its operation for it is based upon eternal truth. Men may agree or disagree about this word of the Lord; if they agree, it adds nothing; if they disagree, it means nothing. Beyond His word we cannot reach, and it is enough for every Latter-day Saint, willing and trying to follow divine guidance (''Message of the First Presidency,' October 3, 1943). QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 1. Why do you think the Lord said all of the blessings promised in the Word of Wisdom revelation would come to those who live all the commandments and not only the health laws of that revelation? 2. Indicate the harmful results of drinking intoxicating beverages even in moderation. 3. According to Elder Mark E. Petersen, what effect may cigarette smoking have upon a Latter-day Saint? 4. What is meant by the promise of hidden treasures? 5. What spiritual benefits are derived from keeping the Word of Wisdom? 6. Discuss: A person's belief does not alter the truth of a revelation. VISITING TEACHER MESSAGE Truths to Live By From the Doctrine and Covenants Christine H. Robinson Message 71 — "For What Doth It Profit a Man If a Gift Is Bestowed Upon Him, and He Receive Not the Gift?"' (D&C 88:33) For First Meeting, April 1966 in the Southern Hemisphere, for September 1966 Objective: To illustrate the fact that God's gifts are ours only if we accept and magnify them. Each of us is endowed with certain gifts from our Father in heaven. These gifts are given to us individually and personally so 63 JANUARY 1966 that we may, if we receive and magnify them, reach to greater heights in the development of our personalities, our characters, and abilities. The Lord tells us in the Doctrine and Covenants, "... To every man is given a gift by the spirit of God. To some is given one, and to some is given another, that all may be profited thereby" (D&C 46:11-12). Whether or not we enjoy these gifts and thus reach the heights the Lord expects of us depends upon our willingness and worthiness to accept them. "For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he receive not the gift?" We must remember that these gifts are from a loving Father in heaven who wants us to be happy and to succeed in life. Yet, they are given to us on the promise that they will be ours only if we accept and magnify them. If we fail to receive and_ develop them in the way that we should, they will be taken away from us. The Prophet Joseph Smith said: Blessings offered, but rejected, are no longer blessings... The proffered good returns to the giver; the blessing is bestowed on those who will receive and occupy; for unto him that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundantly, but unto him that hath not or will not receive, shall be taken away that which he hath, or might have had (DHC V:135). How can we develop most effectively the gifts that have been bestowed upon us? Certainly, one approach would be for us to recognize the gifts, or potentials, that lie within us, desire to develop them, have the faith that we can develop them, and then go about confidently practicing and 64 applying the actions which will magnify and develop them. The apostle Paul said "Neglect not the gift that is in thee... Give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all" (I Tim. 4:14, 15). We often refer to _ wisdom of Solomon. Undoubtedly in so doing, we may wish that we might possess this great wisdom. If we really desire to develop the gift of wisdom, we must practice those qualities which will help us to become wise. For example, before we make any important decisions in respect to any problem, we should get all possible facts and then make sure we evaluate. If we desire the great gift of knowledge we must be willing to study and yearn for learning. If we desire to develop the wondrous gift of faith, this can be obtained only if we practice believing and following the Lord's commandments. We have been admonished to seek ". Earnestly the best gifts, always remembering for what they are given; For verily I say unto you, they are given for the benefit of those who love me and keep all my commandments" (D&C 46:8, 9). A young man was overheard complaining that he had no talents and implying that when God had distributed gifts, he had been passed by. This young man, in fact, seemed proud of his modesty and apparent humility in recognizing his own _ inadequacies. Actually, this young man possessed a _ substantial potential which he was wasting by his negative attitude toward himself and by refusing to recognize his inherent capabilities. In an effort to help him, a wise counselor suggested that he select one simple gift which he definitely possessed. This was a_ special ability to be friendly. He was encouraged to appreciate and to exercise faith in this one gift, and then earnestly work to magnify it. In so doing, he soon found he had other gifts which had been lying dormant. By concentrating on each gift and seeking to mag- - nify it, he succeeded in raising all of his talents and abilities to a higher level of performance. Someone has observed that when we develop one trait fully, there is a tendency for that one trait to pull all the others up to its stature. President Joseph F. Smith has said, ""Every son and LESSON DEPARTMENT every daughter of God has received some talent [or gift], and each will be held to strict account for the use or misuse to which it is put" (Juvenile Instructor, Vol. 38, 1903, page 689). The Lord has many gifts for each of us if we have the faith, courage, will power, and fortitude to work for them. The Lord can and wants to give them to us, but they can become ours only if we accept and use them. "For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he receive not the gift? Behold, he rejoices not in that which is given unto him, neither rejoices in him who is the giver of the gift." WORK MEETING — Development Through Homemaking Education Hazel S. Cannon Cleanliness Is Next to Godliness (A Continuation) For Second Meeting, Apri! 1966 In the Southern Hemisphere, for September 1966 Objective: To show how scheduling of cleaning activities in the home can result in efficient accomplishment of work and in great family happiness. INTRODUCTION You will recall that in Lewis Carroll's delightful story, Alice in Wonderland, Alice and the queen had been "running like mad all day."" Suddenly Alice discovered that they were still under the same tree from which they had started, and expressed her surprise and consternation to the queen. The queen explained that in her country to "get any place" it was necessary to run "twice as fast." With our cleaning tasks in mind, as creative homemakers, we need to analyze our management practices in order that we 65 JANUARY 1966 may keep from "running twice as fast'"' to "get any place." NEW DRILLS FOR OLD SKILLS In. The previous discussion on cleaning-management, planning and the merits of scheduling were stressed. It is important to formulate the details of a schedule. In what ways would re-scheduling or a new approach to an old task mean greater efficiency? Too meticulous or laborious methods should be shunned. Much of the homemaker's time is consumed in child care. Some must be reserved for rest, especially for mothers with young families; for unexpected guests; for interruptions; and for some family fun that has not been planned. You might work a schedule in this manner: Daily Schedule — "Pick-up" in various rooms of house; prepare and serve meals; wash dishes and care for work surfaces of kitchen cupboards and large equipment; sweep and dust kitchen and other rooms which require it; make beds; clean bathroom fixtures. A wise mother will train her family early to accept their responsibilities in maintaining a clean home. In addition to what must be done daily, time should be scheduled to take care of washing, ironing, sewing and mending, baking, and other necessary tasks, which the individual homemaker alone can determine. Weekly Schedule—This would consist of a plan for thorough cleaning of each room of the house. Change bed linens; clean all floors thoroughly, including deep vacuuming of rugs and carpets and washing and waxing of floors where necessary; move furniture and clean underneath, with the exception of very heavy pieces; give furniture special attention as_ to vacuuming over-stuffed pieces, cleaning, dusting etc.; dust difficult areas such as moldings, baseboards and wall and ceiling areas where necessary; remove finger marks from doors, frames, and light switches; give kitchen range and refrigerator extra 66 cleaning; take special care of plants. These jobs may be done on a particular day—or many homemakers prefer thoroughly to clean one room each day along with the daily schedule, rather than leaving it all for, say, Friday. It is felt that much satisfaction results from leaving Saturday for food shopping, food preparation for Sunday, and for family activities instead of reserving it for a weekly cleaning day. Monthly and/or Quarterly Schedule (depending on family set-up)—This schedule would include extra thorough cleaning such as washing windows; cleaning of over-stuffed furniture and cleaning and polishing of wood pieces; vacuuming draperies and/or washing and ironing curtains; cleaning cupboards and drawers; cleaning and waxing certain floors; special cleaning of accessories (especially lamps and light bulbs and light fixtures, bric-abrac, and pictures; and other necessary cleaning not included in the weekly schedule. These tasks are added to the weekly schedule as needed and as they can be included. Some homemakers like to clean or straighten a_ kitchen cupboard or drawer each morning as they wash the breakfast dishes. Semi-Annual Schedule—This is the deep, extra special cleaning of everything from basement to attic so familiar to the housekeeper. Again, many women prefer to do it "by the inch," and clean one room per month rather than devoting a period of time each spring and fall to the "orgy" known as housecleaning. To Discuss: Case Study 1. It is Saturday morning and the entire Price family is at home. Mrs. Price rises at seven o'clock. She prepares breakfast for herself and her husband, and they eat at about seven-thirty. She puts the dishes in the sink, returns to her bedroom, "picks-up," and makes the bed. By this time Timmy, age six, is in the kitchen shouting, "Mommy, I'm hungry. May I have pancakes for breakfast?" She makes the pancakes and serves them to Timmy. It is now eightten and she begins making the apple pies for the ward dinner that evening. Just as she is rolling out the pie dough, Mary, seventeen, enters the kitchen and says she guesses she can't eat because she must be at work at eight-thirty. Mrs. Price fixes her a glass of orange juice, which Mary drinks under protest. Just then twelveyear-old Ricky bounces in and reminds his mother that he must be at his scoutmaster's at nine o'clock and hopes that Timmy hasn't eaten all the pancakes. Mrs. Price hurriedly cooks pancakes for Ricky. Two more late risers come straggling in for breakfast between nine and ten. At eleven o'- clock the pies are in the oven, Mrs. Price has been called to the telephone three times about the ward dinner, and the dishes are still in the sink. She sinks wearily into a chair and then suddenly remembers that Carole is still upstairs, hasn't eaten breakfast, and was to have been at a Primary practice at ten-thirty. How might Mrs. Price have avoided her present dilemma? In what ways could scheduling have helped? Case Study 2. The glass storm door on the front door of the Brown residence is always finger-marked and soiled. Mrs. Brown is a busy homemaker with a family of five lovely children, but maintains a clean, orderly living room. How might callers interpret the dirty storm door? How could care of the storm door become part of the cleaning schedule? YOU ARE THE HOUSEWIFEENGINEER Today the home is considered a small industry and the homemaker is its production engineer. You will, therefore, want (at least to begin with) to block your schedule out on a calendar or a homemade time sheet, allowing so much time for the breakfast dishes, dusting the living room, etc. This is especially important for routine jobs which must be repeated each day. Women who work outside their homes should find a schedule very helpful in accomplishing their home responsibilities in the limited time at their disposal. LESSON DEPARTMENT WORK SCHEDULE POINTERS 1. In. Scheduling, retain the values that are important to your family. A husband should leave for work each morning with new courage to face the world, not feeling that he is being pitted against the time schedule. 2. Do not attempt too much work at one given time. Every hour should have some leeway. 3. Train each family member to "clean-up" and "pick-up" after himself. 4. Keep dirt and soil at a minimum always. (a) Sweep walks and porches often; (b) provide door mats outside doors and protective throw rugs inside doors; (c) protect floor and surfaces when a cleaning or cooking activity will result in splashing or spotting. It is easier to avoid unnessary work than to schedule a "clean-up." 5. Restrict eating to certain rooms or areas. Train children to be seated while eating. Do not allow them to "eat on foot." 6. Try to leave the house "pickedup" each time you go away and before going to bed at night. 7. Someone remarked, "Any man who has lived through housecleaning knows why hurricanes are given feminine names." Try to maintain some straight orderly rooms or areas during housecleaning time. SUMMARY No matter how thoughtfully a schedule is planned, there are times when it cannot be fully executed. Be sure that you always master the schedule and that it does not become your master. Make it work for you. In spite of the unforeseen, however, scheduling will give you the opportunity to control the physical aspects of your home, to create beauty, and to conquer inefficiency and discouragement. TO DO AND THINK ABOUT 1. Discuss scheduling, assignments, and problems during your family home evening council sessions. 67 SOCIAL SCIENCE — Teaching the Gospel in the Home Alberta H. Christensen Lesson 4 (Lesson 16 in Series) — "'Seek And Ye Shall Find' For Third Meeting, April 1966 In the Southern Hemisphere, for June 1966 Objective: To emphasize our responsibility to prepare a personal record of our ancestors, and to motivate women of Relief Society to discover for themselves the many satisfactions of genealogical research. Follow-up on Home-Doing suggestions for Lesson 3 "Personal Standards." Lesson 4 on preparing a personal genealogical record logically follows Lesson 3. INTRODUCTION "Why didn't grandmother tell us where her father was born and where he died? Or even better, why didn't she leave us a written statement?" Such questions, frequently asked by present-day Latter-day Saints, lead us into one area of what the Doctrine and Covenants states is the "most glorious of all subjects belonging to the everlasting gospel, namely, the baptism for the dead" (D&C 128: 17). Very likely this anonymous grandmother knew where her father was born, and had she known how important this information would be to descendants, she would have left a written statement. The element of adventure has always been an inviting factor in the search for truth, for new knowledge. Whether the search be confined to earth, or extended to a stellar space, men have risked their lives in the adventurous search for the unknown. 68 The Savior often spoke in parable of the value of the search and the joy of finding—the search for the lost coin; the search for the one lost sheep, though the ninety and nine were safe within the fold. Genealogical research, which precedes the making of the record and specific ordinance work, is also a search for that which is lost. It is the search for one's own people, and it can become one of the great adventures of life. Adding to the importance of this search is the fact that it is motivated by the commandment of the Lord. Many Latter-day Saint women have been constantly engaged in all phases of vicarious work for the dead. They need no conversion. For the thousands of individuals, however, who are new or comparatively new in the Church, the following question might be a logical one, "Why are a few names, a few dates so important?" In addition to these members who are seeking to understand all the principles of the gospel they have so recently accepted, there are many Latterday Saints who have known about the work for the dead but who have never engaged in it and, therefore, are not familiar with the many satisfactions which can come from participation in this glorious area of gospel living. To prepare one lesson which might meet fully the needs of these three groups would be most difficult. This lesson, therefore, will accent one area only - that of preparing the record of our forefathers. This will include the exciting and rewarding experience of genealogical research, which is necessary in the preparation of all family records. A DIVINE COMMANDMENT Section 128 of the Doctrine and Covenants, among other things, gives instruction on the mission of the prophet Elijah, and baptism for the dead, as a welding link between departed fathers and the living children. It confirms other divine instruction to the effect that records kept on earth as well as those kept in heaven will be used in the final judgment. Referring to Revelation 20:12, the Prophet Joseph Smith writes: I want you to remember that John the Revelator was contemplating this very subject in relation to the dead, when he declared, "And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works." You will discover in this quotation that the books were opened; and another book was opened, which was the book of life; but the dead were judged out of those things which were written LESSON DEPARTMENT in the books, according to their works; consequently, the books spoken of must be the books which contained the record of their works, and refer to the records which are kept on the earth. Now, the nature of this ordinance consists in the power of the priesthood, by the revelation of Jesus Christ, wherein it is granted that whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Or, in other words, taking a different view of the translation, whatsoever you record on earth shall be recorded in heaven, and whatsoever you do not record on earth shall not be recorded in heaven; for out of the books shall your dead be judged, according to their own works, whether they themselves have attended to the ordinances in their own propria persona, or by the means of their own agents, according to the ordinance which God has prepared for their salvation from before the foundation of the world, according to the records which they have kept concerning their dead (D&C 128:6-8). OF IMMEDIATE CONCERN The Lord has given us a commandment to seek out our ancestors and to do a vicarious work for them which they could not do for themselves. Relative to this divine commandment, the Prophet Joseph Smith stated: "The greatest responsibility in this world that God has laid upon us is to seek after our dead" (SMITH, JOSEPH FIELDING, Compiler; Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, Salt Lake City, Deseret News Press, 1938, page 356). This responsibility is not to be postponed until next year, or next generation. We must assume our share of this cooperative endeavor today. The Prophet Joseph Smith also said, "The Saints have not too much time to save and redeem their dead, and gather together their living relatives, that they may be saved 69 JANUARY 1966 also, before the earth will be smitten, and the consumption decreed falls upon the world" (J bid, page 330). PERSONAL RECORD ESSENTIAL The commandment of the Lord regarding vicarious work for the dead involves two distinct areas of effort: 1. The obtaining of specific information which will identify and establish relationships of individuals in whom we have special interest. This information is to be recorded according to specified instructions and preserved. 2. The performing of required ordinances within the Temple, for these individuals who have had no opportunity to do the work for themselves. Many Latter-day Saints have believed that since records are kept in heaven and also kept by the Church upon earth, no more records are necessary. This, however, is not so. We are commanded to keep a personal record. In a letter to the saints (D&C 128:24) the Prophet instructs us concerning the need and nature of vicarious work, including the records to be made. He writes, 'Let us, therefore, as a church and a people, and as Latter-day Saints, offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness; and let us present in his holy temple, when it is finished a book containing the records of our dead, which shall be worthy of all acceptation." This is the Book of Remembrance. What an impressive title for this essential record! A BOOK OF REMEMBRANCE In the sixth chapter of Moses, we read of records prepared and kept by Adam and Eve, "And a book of remembrance was kept, in the which was recorded, in the 70 language of Adam, for it was given unto as many as called upon God to write by the spirit of inspiration... And a genealogy was kept of the children of God. And this was the book of the generations of Adam" (P of GP, Moses 6:5, 8). From these quotations revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith, in December 1830, we learn of information which is essential to our Book of Remembrance. What it should contain. According to the Priesthood Genealogical Committee of the Church, a Book of Remembrance should contain two primary divisions: Division 1 - Genealogical information relating to the direct line of the family, and pedigree charts as far back as we have been able to trace them. This would include the seven family group sheets prepared as part of the Priesthood Genealogy Program of 1965. It should also include eight sheets (four for the husband and four for the wife) on the families of our great grandparents, which are to be a part of this program for 1966. As additional family group sheets on the direct line are completed, and as the pedigree line is extended, they should be added to the record. Division 2 - Biographical material available, relative to parents, grandparents, or any ancestor whose name appears on the pedigree chart. If personal accounts are not available, then we should write what is known of their life stories. Spiritual experiences that have been meaningful to the family might appropriately be included. There should be a personal record of the person or persons compiling the record, which would include such information as birth, baptism, ordination, marriage, special blessings, missions, etc. Have you prepared a Book of Remembrance? If so, does it qualify, according to the above requirements? OF HISTORIC INTEREST We know from scripture that vicarious work for the dead is not a new doctrine. The Prophet Joseph Smith states this "was the burden of the scriptures" (SMITH, JOSEPH ° FIELDING, Compiler; Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, page 193). 'Salvation for the dead was understood in the days of the primitive Christian Church, and to some extent baptisms for the dead continued to be performed until A. D. 379" MCCONKIE, BRUCE R., Compiler; Doctrines of Salvation, Sermons and Writings of Joseph Fielding Smith, Vol. II, page 163). Supporting this assertion are the words of Paul the apostle in his epistle to the Corinthians: "Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? Why are they then baptized for the dead?" (I Cor. 15:29). That there was no work for the dead until after the crucifixion of Christ, is supported by scripture. There could be no baptisms or endowments or any other work for the dead before the death of Jesus Christ. He it was who carried the message of the gospel to the dead and bridged the gulf spoken of in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus. He it was who, in fulfillment of the prophets, opened the door of the prison house and permitted the prisoners to come free. Until that time the dead were waiting for their salvation or redemption, which should come through the blood of Christ (Ibid., pp. 164- 165). After the resurrection of Christ the doors were opened to the dead, and the vicarious work for the dead was instituted and the authority of the Priesthood held by Elijah was then extended to include blessings for the dead, who would have received the gospel, if the privilege had been LESSON DEPARTMENT granted to them on this earth (Jbid., page 164). THE REWARDING SEARCH Although systematic and consistent research is to be encouraged, much needed information may be obtained from unexpected sources. One need only to be genuinely interested and alert; willing to listen and to put forth the effort to follow through on any "leads" that are found. Diaries, or old journals, old letters, old newspapers, and also family Bibles may often contain valuable information for the present-day genealogist. Where a family organization exists, it is often profitable to ask all members to go through their homes in search of any of the foregoing articles mentioned, for possible use by any other family members. Family cooperation is one of the most rewarding of benefits of genealogical work, for it brings living families together in mutual interests and affection. Numerous individuals throughout the world also have been cooperating unknowingly. Motivated by the spirit of Elijah, they have been and are spending both time and money in preparing histories and records of their forefathers. By 1844 there were only about thirty-seven published family histories.... Family genealogies are now numbered by the hundreds of thousands... (BENNETT, ARCHIBALD F.: Saviors on Mount Zion, page 75). To find an unknown ancestor after years and years of search is an experience almost too thrilling to be expressed in words. Far too numerous to be recorded, are the rewarding experiences which highlight the road of 71 JANUARY 1966 genealogical discovery —- a road which all Latter-day Saint families may travel, if they will. Fragments of conversation of individuals who are making this journey follow. They may kindle your own imagination and motivate your own resourcefulness. Woman #1 - Last month I found in a box of family mementos and relics a letter which has been unnoticed for over sixty years. It gave me the place and definite date of an inheritance settlement of years ago. I wrote to the Probate Judge of the city, for a copy of the court proceedings. As a result, I now have the name of a previously unknown second wife and child for the family group sheet. Woman #2 - While living in a large city a few years ago, I telephoned a home listed under the name in which I was interested. I inquired of the man who answered the call if he knew of any printed book on the family line. He said he did not, but suggested that I write his father. I did this. His father's prompt reply began, 'Indeed I do know of a book on that family in America and I am sending it to you as a gift."'" What a priceless gift, for a telephone call and a letter! Woman #8 - I have just discovered something interesting about cousin Jethro. He was born in March of 1720, followed the sea and became a wealthy ship captain. During the American Revolution he gave $20,000 to buy shoes and blankets for the soldiers at Valley Forge. He's no longer just a name on the family group sheet. Have you a similar experience you could recount? There are literally thousands of illustrations where genealogical research has brought the personal satisfactions of new and lasting friendships, deepened the interest in further research, and has resulted in faith-promoting experiences. Those who are busily engaged in research work, today, affirm 72 that earnest desire and prayerful effort are essentials which may bring into fulfillment that great promise of the Savior, "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you" (Matt. 7:7). The followi: g words by President Wilford Woodruff given in General Conference, October 1891, are applicable: It is a great blessing that we stand in the flesh in this last dispensation and fulness of times; and where we can open our hearts to understand these blessings, all of us will labor, as far as we have opportunity, to attend to this duty for our dead. I do not want to go into the spirit world and meet with my progenitors and have them say to me, "You held the keys of my redemption and my salvation and you neglected to do this work, and I am. Not redeemed'" (1966 Melchizedek Priesthood Lessons, Lesson 38). FOR DISCUSSION Questions which arise in the class period. Have class members relate, briefly, some of their own personal experiences in compiling the seven group sheets during the past year. FOR HOME DOING: 1. Become aware of the names on your pedigree chart so that no unexpected opportunity to obtain information will slip by you. Enlist the cooperation of family members. Young people often have found important genealogical information. 2. Do you have any biographical accounts of your parents or other persons appearing on your pedigree charts? If you do not, but know of relatives who might have this data, write for a copy. 3. Become acquainted through the high priest group leader of your ward with brochures and printed books written by Latter-day Saint members as special help for beginning researchers. Very useful among these brochures and printed books are: Genealogical Research - A Practical Mission, by HOWARD S. BENNION, The Deseret Sunday School Union. This book contains names of individuals who are specialists in research in different countries who have authored books on genealogy; Saviors on Mount Zion, by ARCHIBALD F. BENNETT. These books may be found in ward libraries. LESSON DEPARTMENT 4. Become familiar, through your ward high priest group leader, with the Pedigree Referral Service of the Genealogical Society. 5. Add to the suggestions for individual home activity this: Thank your Heavenly Father that you were permitted to come to earth in the dispensation of the fullness of time, with the privilege of being a savior on Mount Zion. LITERATURE—The Individual and Human Values As Seen Through Literature Elder Robert K. Thomas Lesson 14—Facing Death—Part | (Text: ''Out of the Best Books"' pp. 420-39, 445-47, 473-82.) For Fourth Meeting, April 1966. In the Southern Hemisphere, July 1966 Objective: To consider death, viewed with relationship INTRODUCTION In this month's lesson we shall discuss two short stories and two poems. Each is concerned with a particular situation in which death must be faced. The first selection for study is "The Sick Child," by the French writer, Colette. "The Sick Child,'' by Colette When, at the conclusion of "The Sick Child,' the author suggests that recovery from illness is not without its loss, we are tempted to brush aside this comment in relief and gratitude for the young life saved. What if the night has "lost its magic" and has become ''meek and disenchanted"? The dreams of the child are only fever-induced fanto different life situations. Tasy, happily forgotten in health. Yet to discount this final point is to miss a significant part of a beautifully written story. The plot of 'The Sick Child" could hardly be simpler. A small boy, Jean, afflicted with infantile paralysis and expected to die, rallies to survive a crisis and begin his recovery. To reduce the story to this is to make clear how little it depends upon plot. Characterization is equally simple; "Lady Mother' is appropriately maternal; the nurse Mandore is bluffly affectionate. Even the precocious child is just that. What then accounts for the universal appeal of the story? To begin with, the theme of childhood sickness provides a 73 JANUARY 1966 situation that most readers can identify with easily. But very little of this story has to do with Jean's actual illness. What is unforgettable is the heightened awareness of life that imminent death brings. Note how the intensity of the crisis is reflected in the culminating force of the images used: He had lost all sense of time passing so he could only judge by what he experienced. Often he believed that he was following a shadowy guide, one who had difficulty himself in finding the trail. Then he whimpered because he could not take the lead and, hearing his own wail of humbled pride or of utter exhaustion, he wheeled sharply, plunged through the wake of a cyclone, in search of a corner where he might find refuge. Now he was gripped with the agony of inhabiting a country where there were no corners, only a freezing current of dark air, a night on whose breast he was nothing more than a lost and weeping lad. Then he stood up, on legs that suddenly grew in number, that stretched to stilts through which pain cut like a scythe (Text, page 433; reprinted by permission of Jacques Chambrun, New York). All the words here seem rooted in reality—yet somehow not limited by the actual. As Jean approaches death, the familiar symbols and relationships by which his life is directed come apart. Sounds, for instance, are no longer loud or soft; they are "hunchbacked" or "with pointed snouts like weasels." Such language transcends conventional levels, yet seems "right.'"' No standard description appears capable of evoking sounds so intense that they take on shape as well as audibility. Colette seems to be saying that we appreciate the total richness and variety of life only as we come close to leaving it. Our lives are 74 often so regular that we standardize them, seeing routinely and acting predictably. How gratifying the most obvious manifestations of life appear to be when we are shaken out of our usual reactions. This story provides an exceptional opportunity for discussion of the multiple functions of lan- C guage in literary communication. We are so used to words stating that we often feel a little uneasy when they suggest or evoke instead of asserting. Note that Jean's moment of greatest physical crisis is suggested, not medically described, by the following: Now the boy who had been so gay and so spoiled, so at home in his loneliness, so wrapped up in his privileges as a fatherless invalid, knew that only a sad little sound as of crystal breaking, remained between him and a happiness whose hollow name he had still to learn: death (Text, page 432). By suggesting instead of stating, the author helps us see freshly and forces us to become part of whatever is being presented. If we are to get anything at all from reading that passing from life to death is "a sad little sound as of crystal breaking," we must try to involve ourselves in the mood which the author is providing for us. Assertive words usually serve as signposts which clearly point the way and require little more than mechanical following on our part. Suggestive words are more like compasses; they provide general direction, but leave the traveler to make his own path. "The Death of the Dauphin" by Alphonse Daudet The second selection for this month exploits a theme which is a very old one: death the leveller. It is probably appropriate that the selection we have chosen to illustrate this is French, for this idea has been especially prevalent in France. As early as the Thirteenth Century there were examples of what came to be known as the danse macabre or dance of the dead. While there were varied representations of this theme, they shared the basic idea that death is always lurking in the midst of life. Possibly reflecting the New Testament parable of the rich man who finally decided to enjoy the goods he had acquired, only to be told by the Lord that he was to die that very night (Luke 12:16-21), this concept served not only to reemphasize the vanity of earthly wishes; it also became a constant reminder that only death could put life into proper perspective. "The Death of the Dauphin" is really just a modern adaptation of this ancient theme. It even retains the pictorial quality of early danse macabre presentations. Note how the characters in this little story are grouped. We hardly need dialogue as we go from scene to scene— weeping maids of honor bowing on the stairs, robed doctors disputing just outside the sick room, the child's tutors at the door, the king in stoic isolation —all are focused on the bed in which the dying Dauphin lies. The pomp of this picture is in ironic contrast to the pale child on the white pillow., Daudet's style is appropriate to his tale. If much of what is presented is sketched in with vivid, contrasting strokes, the matter-of-fact reporting of what is happening heightens the conLESSON DEPARTMENT trast between regal life and common death. Yet Daudet manages to be tender where most writers in this vein are merely grim. The imperious, insensitive Prince is, at last, only a crying child seeking the comfort that nothing earthly can give. "Tithonus" by Alfred Lord Tennyson The final selections for the month examine special problems in relation to death. Tennyson's "Tithonus" chronicles the despair of one who cannot die, one who in the words of Job "longs for death, but it cometh not." The poem tells the story of Tithonus, son of the king of Troy, who was married to Aurora, goddess of the dawn. Tithonus was a mortal being, subject to ageing and death, and Aurora was immortal, beyond the effects of either ageing or death. At the request of Aurora, the gods granted Tithonus eternal life, but she neglected to request eternal youth for him. Therefore, as the years came and went, he grew forever older, forever more feeble, but could not die. In lamentation for his plight, Tithonus in the poem cries out, ""Me only cruel immortality consumes; I wither slowly in thine arms... Immortal age beside immortal youth." Later he pleads, "Let me go; take back thy gift." He would die, but cannot. Finally, according to the old legend, but beyond the limits of Tennyson's poem, Tithonus grew so withered and ugly that Aurora turned him into a grasshopper (Text, pages 476-477). For members of the Church, Tennyson's poem may have unusual meaning—particularly in the light of the beautiful sermon on "restoration" in Chapters 40 and 41 of Alma in The Book of Mormon. We speak so easily of death as a release—and surely it frees us from the pains that flesh is heir to—but the choices we have made, rise with us in an 75 JANUARY 1966 after life. It is a bit sad to hear Tithonus lament his decaying body at length but dismiss the wrong choice which brought about his woe in a line or two. How difficult it is to see that the essence of tragedy lies not in how death comes but in the choices which may have governed one's life. To those who see this life as part of an eternal plan, death is not so much release as it is progression. If we accept this view, it is not hard to believe that death is to be feared only where one has not prepared himself for the accounting which death exacts. "Auto Wreck"' by Karl Shapiro 'Auto Wreck" concerns itself with death which seems not only premature but needless, and is a powerful indictment of man's inability to solve his basic problems. "Auto Wreck" gives a focus which is personal for most of us. In fact, part of Shapiro's point is that the violence of death by automobile accident is so commonplace that we are becoming inured to it. We slow down momentarily as we pass the scene of a wreck; we may even hope aloud that no one was badly hurt. But, once well past the flashing lights and sirens, we resume the speed and _ driving habits which may unite us with total strangers in the grim intimacy of death. One of the ways in which the author has tried to keep us aware of our collective guilt and shared danger, is to develop the poem in terms of an injured victim. The bell of the ambulance beats like a heart; the flare pulses like a cut artery; the throats of the onlookers are 76 "tight as tourniquets,' and the horror of the scene holds those who gather as if their feet were "bound in splints." Yet Shapiro does not rely on this device alone to make us feel our identification with those directly involved. The bell of the ambulance tolls as well as beats, and in its tolling we hear echoes of John Donne's famous sermon in which he reminds us that we needn't send to find out for whom the funeral bell tolls, for when any man dies, humanity is diminished, and as part of humanity we also suffer. There is nothing so ordered as rhyme in "Auto Wreck." Many of the lines scurry, then pause, only to resume their speed once more, and we realize that the author is letting us drive through the poem as we approach, circle around, and then accelerate on past the accident. The final stanza, however, transcends the specific accident in trying to fit the particular into the whole—but the poem ends in despair. Other forms of death may be rationalized, if not justified, but the carnage which is becoming an accepted fact of travel by automobile seems hopeless of solution. Such death becomes a tragic commentary upon modern man's enslavement of a technology which is at once his pride and his destruction. Questions for Discussion 1. How convincing is Colette's suggestion that life must be jarred from its usual modes if we are really to appreciate it? 2. Under what conditions might the universality of death serve to unite people? 3. To what extent do you think Tithonus has recognized his problem in the last lines of Tennyson's poem? TO THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE Mable Jones Gabbott The way will not be always silk and song For you, my second son, the one in the middle. Ahead the first ones freely stride along And those behind are sheltered, being little. But in the middle of the world are those Whose stride is tempered, those who cannot walk Apart, because the needs of others close Upon them, to measure both their step and talk. So they, like you, will learn to give and sway, And being flexible will learn to grow, And in the middle of the night to pray Perhaps, and only you will come to know The deep harmonious tuning of life's strings That being in the middle always brings.

It was the easiest way of identifying this loved couple, so one uncles, great-aunts and great-uncles, and the so-called "aunts" and "uncles" which every child has, who are no blood relation at all, but are friends of his parents—to which latter class these two belonged. But to get back to the nicknames: Whenever Auntie Inclination would ask Uncle Time to do any special little chore around the place, he would invariably answer, "Yes, M'love, when I get time." And Auntie would just as invariably mutter under her breath, so he couldn't hear (because she would not offend him for the world!) "And inclination!" "The flower-garden wants hoeing," she would remind him. "Yes, M'love, when I get time." He always called her M'love. "And inclination," she would whisper resignedly. "The screen door needs new paint," or "J think you should write to your brother Tom," or "How about seeing Attorney Jones about getting our will drawn up?" she would suggest. And we knew Uncle Time would do it when he got time—and inclination! We could never see where Uncle was crowded for time. He could spend days on end off fishing. He could hob-nob for hours with neighbor Duncan over the pasture fence. He could sit in the shade and cut little sticks into shavings, not making anything, just whittling. He could spin yarns with the boys at the corner grocery far into the night. So we concluded that the reason the weeds took the yard, the paint curled on the screen door, the letter never reached brother Tom, and Uncle would probably die intestate, was not really lack of time, but lack of inclination. Deep in his heart he probably knew this. But it is so much easier to blame time rather than inclination for our procrastination and omissions! Time is something outside ourselves, while inclination is 4 part of us. Who would not rather "pass the buck" than admit his own failure? So we find people all around us (and we do it ourselves if we have the courage to admit it), who continually get their semantics mixed up. They don't have time to 80 to church, to teach a class, to work on the welfare farm, to visit a shut-in, to read the scriptures OF other good books, to serve in a civic capacity, to write to a loved one, to develop their talents, to do a hundred and one simple acts of service that would bring joy to others, and, incidentally, to themselves. Yet some people, with the same twenty-four-hour day, find or make time for such things. We seem to have time for what we really want to do. Time is a great gift. But it seems increasingly clear that of the two, inclination is the greater, for it determines what we do with our time. Fortunately, though time is static, inclination ls something we can enlarge. It is in our power to control. The people we admire for their accomplishments and service have succeeded through directing their inclinations. For many of them, the obligations of duty have imposed on their time, it is true. But like a persistent tree that grows in a rock, their inclinations have been strong enough to triumph. For this they merit and receive our praise. It would seem appropriate when we include the familiar phrase in our prayers, "Help us to use our time and talents to advantage," hat we add the more important request that he help us also to develop a set of wholesome and sturdy inclinations. 719 Mrs. Anna Wagstaff McGhie Salt Lake City, Utah Mrs. Mary E.
