The gift drawer or box is not only a preventive of this, but is also a constant reminder to all the family of the Christmas spirit throughout the year.

Take notice of the wide difference in shades and tints of green by sunlight, shadow, twilight, moonlight, and by starlight. These should be studied. Green is persistent, its colour shows strongly at night, or by lamplight. Note the difference in sage-brush green with its blue tendency. The alfalfa in strong sunlight shows more yellow. The apple green also has the same warm tone of yellow. The sage and willow we call cool greens, the alfalfa and apple green in sunlight are the warm greens.

Come with me a moment.\" \"Dwight, prepare yourself for a blow circumstances connected with this case prove to me that your wife, herself, is responsible for the premature birth, and consequent death, of that helpless babe.\" Dwight Carlin stiffened as if the surgeon had dealt him a blow. \"What proofs have you, doctor?\" he enquired, sternly. The physician drew from his pocket a vial containing a dark liquid, and a small box, in which lay nine tiny black tablets. \"These I found partially concealed in your wife's dressing table. A servant girl told me she saw her mistress take both liquid and tablets before retiring last night also, that she brought; her a tea cup half full of hot water in which she dropped thirty drops from this bottle she counted the drops, she said, as they; fell from the dropper.\" After a moment's pause the doctor continued \"The name of the drug, of w",

Go home, return in an hour with the money, and the prescription is yours.\" Mrs. Carlin arose and left the house without further comment. \"It's an awful price,\" she told herself, as she walked slowly homeward, \"but I must have it, cost what it may, and I will; Dwight gave me twenty-five dollars to pay Hannah yesterday. I have not given it and Hannah can wait until I can get her the money some other way.\" In an hour she again appeared at Mrs. Lomond's home; the money was paid and she was soon again wending her way homeward. This time she carried in her hand-bag a two-ounce bottle containing a dark liquid and a small box, in which were twelve tiny black tablets. Edith hurried home, anxious to conceal her package, fearing detection, perhaps. Tonight she would take the medicine and by morning? When morning dawned, the mistress of Carlin Mansion was violently ill.

They are doing everything in their power to get farmers to organize. They aim to bring about conditions which will make the country so attractive that it will take its due place in civilization. Country roads are being improved. Ease of communication is aiding advertisers to offer the installment buying system thus putting their goods into rural homes. Changed conditions are influencing the thinking in the farm home. Extension work through colleges, country high schools, country agents, farmer's bulletins, and leadership-week activities are doing their part. Rural Ideas are changing all. This is of vital interest, for it has its influence on each member of the farm family, particularly on the farm' woman. The Mother Overlooked In the rural home the mother has been overlooked. Her importance has not been appreciated. She it is to whom one must look for leadership in rural life. She is the spiritual force in the home, the guardian of her children. Her presence, her hands, her smile, her fingers, have always done their part in stimulating the men who have ruled the world. She is always home while the workers are in the field. If the father is sick, she manages the farm. If he becomes disappointed she gives him courage. She is the one who knows the child mind before the child can talk.

They are doing everything in their power to get farmers to organize. They aim to bring about conditions which will make the country so attractive that it will take its due place in civilization. Country roads are being improved. Ease of communication is aiding advertisers to offer the installment buying system thus putting their goods into rural homes. Changed conditions are influencing the thinking in the farm home. Extension work through colleges, country high schools, country agents, farmer's bulletins, and leadership-week activities are doing their part. Rural Ideas are changing all. This is of vital interest, for it has its influence on each member of the farm family, particularly on the farm' woman. The Mother Overlooked In the rural home the mother has been overlooked. Her importance has not been appreciated. She it is to whom one must look for leadership in rural life. She is the spiritual force in the home, the guardian of her children. Her presence, her hands, her smile, her fingers, have always done their part in stimulating the men who have ruled the world. She is always home while the workers are in the field. If the father is sick, she manages the farm. If he becomes disappointed she gives him courage. She is the one who knows the child mind before the child can talk. She interprets one child to another and composes their conflicts. 82 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE S"

In 1916 the General Board requested all the wards in the Church to write a brief history of the ward from the beginning to 1916, and place it in the Relief Society record book in a space set aside for this work.

This has also been neglected in some instances. These histories are invaluable, and should all be completed by the end of the year. In some cases rather elaborate and lengthy histories have been written. These should be abbreviated for the books, and the original carefully preserved and kept with the record books. As you have all learned, a Relief Society handbook has been issued by the General Board. It is written in three sections: (1) Historical Account of the Relief Society; (2) Sketches of the General Presidents; (3) Organization, Procedure and Instructions. This book will be found invaluable to stake and ward officers and to members, as it will answer practically all questions arising RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE 4 BROWN LYMAN from time to time about your work.

I began to wonder what so many of them did in such a little house, and all of a sudden an idea hit me with such a jolt that I sat down in the snow to think. Mrs. Durphy had so many children that she wouldn't even miss one, and with Mr. Durphy gone so much, nobody knew where, I'm sure they wouldn't be getting Toni dolls and desks and everything else. 'The ideas began racing up and down me so fast like pins sticking in me. I was so excited I scrambled to my feet without even shaking the snow from my pants. 'There was a lot of noise inside the house, and I could hear a baby crying. But I went up and knocked on the door. There was a hush inside for awhile, then the door opened, not too wide. Mrs. Durphy had the crying baby in her arms. It was barefoot, and she tried to wrap the ragged blanket around its little feet. She looked so tired and worried that I thought she must have been working awful hard. \"Yes?\" she said holding the door from coming clear open. \"What do you want?\" \"Mrs. Durphy,\" I said, \"I want to borrow something.\" She hesitated a minute like she didn't know what to do, then she opened the door wider. \"Come in.\" I walked in. There were children all over the floor, and they stared at me with big eyes. Over in the corner I could see the one. 'Two little girls were sitting by a piece of paper and some broken crayons.

The beauty of the Christmas flower and the symbolism of the candlelight bring the radiant Christmas season into a delightfully original portrait of 'a tree with trimmings.\" Celebrating Christmas Without Going Into Debt Mary E. Bergman () In the early years of our marriage the available money for Christmas expenditures was scarce. After listening to friends expound on the pitfalls of charge accounts that would take months to pay off, lavish gifts to children that seldom pleased them for more than a few weeks, and fancy holiday parties, I realized that it would be most advantageous to fall back on my own resources. Often, the innocence of childhood can be changed into selfishness by parents who are unable to withstand the onslaught of hardsell tactics employed at Christmas time. Our gifts to Cathy that year totaled an expenditure of fifty-nine cents, but required hours of time and preparation. She was delighted, and her enjoyment of our homemade toys led me to believe that I had stumbled on a precious secret. Throughout the years, my children and I have learned together the satisfaction of counters filled with delicious home-baked goodies. Amid the pleasant aromas in our home, we stitched 'God Bless Our Home\" samplers, for each adult on our list, and we made stuffed toys of all varieties for the children, and a boxful to be sent to the Primary Children's Hospital. For the entire holiday season, we become absorbed in sewing, gluing, baking, molding salt clay, painting, building, and so on. Mark, being a normal energetic boy, doesn't always adapt to these quiet occupations. One afternoon while Cathy and I were engrossed in a project, I gave Mark a bowl of vegetables to chop for homemade soup that was bubbling on the stove. He was fascinated by the process of putting raw materials into the kettle and afterward being able to savor the taste of the resulting soup. Thereafter he became the official soup maker, starting from scratch and doing the entire project himself. We poured this soup into decorated quart jars to be delivered to various people.

Watson, Member, General Board of Relief Society Relief Society women are ingenious. Show them a thing of beauty and lo! With their own magic hands they can create its likeness. Since variety is a necessary requisite of any worthy Relief Society project, they change and add, putting a new detail here and color there, enhancing and beautifying most every object. Such it was with the candlesticks made by the sisters of Valley View Eighth Ward, Valley View Stake, under the direction of Sister Janet G. Ogden. Each one was different in color and design, and each was decorated by the sisters to blend and add charm to the decor of the different homes. The tall, more ornate candlesticks were designed for use in the living room or family room areas. The shorter, smaller ones were planned to grace a dining room or kitchen table. A variety of finishes was used. Some were painted with a flat paint and finished with an antique glaze. The smaller ones were covered with enamel paint; the large ringed candles were stained in walnut finish with an antique glaze added. Flowers, fruits, greens, and ribbons were used to decorate them. Some of the sisters made their own candles where a particular color and size was needed. Everyone was so de- (continued on page 933) These handsome candlesticks, above, stained with walnut, were made by Margaret Arnold. The small ones were painted with co"

And Ardell Ross Artificial fruit, pine cones, and leaves, sprayed gold, and attractively arranged, form the basis for Ardell Ross' Christmas table. The red candles are even more striking when the table is set with red dishes. A dark green, many-branched _ tree, with multi-colored _ lights, stands near the end of the table and sheds a soft light upon the table. An almost feathery effect is created by the use of pink lights on a white tree. Red poinsettias and golden doves contrast and blend with the pink and white. Around Christmas time it seems fitting that we use as decoration in our homes some reminder. Of that joyful occurrence we commemorate at the Christmas season. Anyone can buy beautiful decorations, but how much more meaning will something beautiful you made yourself have to you and your family! Materials needed: 1. Plaster of Paris heads, hands, and feet for Joseph, Mary, and Jesus (these were 3%\" high for Joseph, 3\" for Mary and 2\" for Jesus). They came with matching plaster hands and feet, except for the baby; for him you may use plastic hands. 2. Styrofoam cones, one 21\" tall for Joseph, and one 10\" tall for Mary (remember she is seated). 3. Cotton fabric and white water solvent glue or cotton pre-treated draping fabric available at craft stores. 4. Wire strong but bendable and a good quality glue. 5. Paint in desired colors, antiquing, and spray glaze. Transparency by J M. Heslop \"The Holy Family\" Johna de St Jeor Member General Board of Relief Society Plaster heads, hands, and feet come with holes in them. Insert wire pieces, glue, and allow to dry. Stick wires securely into cones forming shoulders, arms, and necks (with head on top) for both Joseph and Mary, but for Mary, shape wire and secure for sitting position. It may be necessary to pad or wrap with fabric shoulders and legs for a more life-like form. Pose the figures' arms and legs to the desired form. Using a picture of the nativity scene, cut the fabric to resemble the type of clothing used in those times. If you are using pre-treated fabric dip and drape; if regular cotton, dilute glue with water and dip fabric and drape on figure; allow to dry completely. Paint whole with several coats of gesso. Refer to picture, using it as a guide for pleasingly rich colors for the clothing. After paint is dry, apply antiquing, being sure to get it back into the folds of fabric. Wipe off the glaze and allow to dry. Spray with clear finish to acquire a shining, clear, china-like surface. More than one coat of spray may be necessary. Use the same technique for the Child.

Open House Utah State Fair September 11-20, 1970 Under a General Board committee, with Edythe K. Watson as chairman, the Olympus Stake Relief Society Board, with the cooperation of Stake President LeGrand Curtis, prepared this beautifully arranged and informative display. The oil paintings by Clyde Smith (of Olympus Stake) represented the courses of study and services of Relief Society: visiting teaching, compassionate service, Singing Mothers, spiritual living, social relations, and cultural refinement. The artist painted the pictures especially for the display at the fair. They are 30 inches by 48 inches, and all the models are from Olympus Stake. Homemaking arts were illustrated and displayed on a long table covered with an attractive deep blue cloth. Seated on the rocker is Lola J. Peterson, President, Olympus Stake Relief Society, demonstrating the making of an afghan. Continuous demonstrations were given which awakened the interest of those who visited the fair and learned more about Relief Society from narrations presented by stake board members and ward Relief Society officers. 925 Homemaking Display at Relief Society Annual General Conference Views of the Homemaking Display held in the Salt Palace, Salt Lake City, Utah, as a part of the 1970 Relief Society Annual General Conference. The center motif was a carousel, with different displays featured around the large hall. The carousel itself was prepared by Emigration Stake under the direction of President Hazel J. Young. Dorotha Smart supervised the construction of the carousel and was assisted in the displays by JaNeanne Webster. Featured around the carousel were items prepared by stakes throughout the Church. The displays included home and gift items, handicraft, foods, pastry and candy, as well as ne items especially designed for children.
