COUNSELOR AMY I HAVE been asked to say a few words this morning about the Relief Society histories, and to congratulate you upon the work you have done up to date. In 1916 the General Board requested all the wards in the Church to write a brief history of the ward from the beginning to 1916, and place it in the Relief Society record book in a space set aside for this work. It was then requested that each year following, the current history be recorded yearly in the proper allotted space. We find that this has not been done in all cases, and we are requesting that the histories be written up to date by the end of this year. We also asked, when the new record book was adopted, that the stake history, from the time of the organization of the stake, be written up to date in the history section of the stake book. This has also been neglected in some instances. These histories are invaluable, and should all be completed by the end of the year. In some cases rather elaborate and lengthy histories have been written. These should be abbreviated for the books, and the original carefully preserved and kept with the record books. As you have all learned, a Relief Society handbook has been issued by the General Board. It is written in three sections: (1) Historical Account of the Relief Society; (2) Sketches of the General Presidents; (3) Organization, Procedure and Instructions. This book will be found invaluable to stake and ward officers and to members, as it will answer practically all questions arising RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE 4 BROWN LYMAN from time to time about your work. It has a table of contents following the general arrangement of the book, and an extensive alphabetically arranged index in the back, for ready and quick reference. The General Board recommends that all stake and ward officers procure this book, and encourage the members to do the same. The price is, cloth bound 85 cents, paper bound 60 cents. It may be obtained at the office of the General Secretary. The Governor of Utah has appointed a committee of 100 to make recommendations regarding unemployment, and in other states and in Canada steps are being taken to improve conditions.

This majestic formation has, through the work of mother nature's playfulness, been thrown together in such a position as to resemble the features of a human countenance. In gazing upward at the structure planned by mother nature, one readily compares it to the \"Great Stone Face\" in the narrative written by our noted American Author, Nathanael Hawthorne. And what was the Great Stone Face? Hawthorne describes it as. An enormous giant, or a Titan, who had sculptured his own likeness on a mountain which helped to inclose a spacious valley containing many thousand inhabitants. There was the broad arch of the forehead; a hundred feet in height; the nose with its long bridge; and the vast lips, which, if they could have spoken would have rolled their thunderous accents from one end of the valley to the other. It was an inspiration for the children to have the Great Stone Face before their eyes, for all the features were noble, and the expression was ' grand, yet sweet. A mother and her little son sat at the cottage door gazing and talking about the Great Stone Face. The lad came to love it, and loving it grew to be like it. Here the author gives us a picture of a boy growing up under the influence of high ideals. Such is always the results of companionship with the great and good, and the story with its underlying allegory is an incentive, not only to the young, to seek that which is noble, but to those who are responsible for the training of the young, to see that right environment is provided for their charges.
