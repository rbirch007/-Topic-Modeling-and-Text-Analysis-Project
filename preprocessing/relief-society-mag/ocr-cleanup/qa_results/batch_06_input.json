The beauty of the Christmas flower and the symbolism of the candlelight bring the radiant Christmas season into a delightfully original portrait of 'a tree with trimmings.\" Celebrating Christmas Without Going Into Debt Mary E. Bergman () In the early years of our marriage the available money for Christmas expenditures was scarce. After listening to friends expound on the pitfalls of charge accounts that would take months to pay off, lavish gifts to children that seldom pleased them for more than a few weeks, and fancy holiday parties, I realized that it would be most advantageous to fall back on my own resources. Often, the innocence of childhood can be changed into selfishness by parents who are unable to withstand the onslaught of hardsell tactics employed at Christmas time. Our gifts to Cathy that year totaled an expenditure of fifty-nine cents, but required hours of time and preparation. She was delighted, and her enjoyment of our homemade toys led me to believe that I had stumbled on a precious secret. Throughout the years, my children and I have learned together the satisfaction of counters filled with delicious home-baked goodies. Amid the pleasant aromas in our home, we stitched 'God Bless Our Home\" samplers, for each adult on our list, and we made stuffed toys of all varieties for the children, and a boxful to be sent to the Primary Children's Hospital. For the entire holiday season, we become absorbed in sewing, gluing, baking, molding salt clay, painting, building, and so on. Mark, being a normal energetic boy, doesn't always adapt to these quiet occupations. One afternoon while Cathy and I were engrossed in a project, I gave Mark a bowl of vegetables to chop for homemade soup that was bubbling on the stove. He was fascinated by the process of putting raw materials into the kettle and afterward being able to savor the taste of the resulting soup. Thereafter he became the official soup maker, starting from scratch and doing the entire project himself. We poured this soup into decorated quart jars to be delivered to various people.

Watson, Member, General Board of Relief Society Relief Society women are ingenious. Show them a thing of beauty and lo! With their own magic hands they can create its likeness. Since variety is a necessary requisite of any worthy Relief Society project, they change and add, putting a new detail here and color there, enhancing and beautifying most every object. Such it was with the candlesticks made by the sisters of Valley View Eighth Ward, Valley View Stake, under the direction of Sister Janet G. Ogden. Each one was different in color and design, and each was decorated by the sisters to blend and add charm to the decor of the different homes. The tall, more ornate candlesticks were designed for use in the living room or family room areas. The shorter, smaller ones were planned to grace a dining room or kitchen table. A variety of finishes was used. Some were painted with a flat paint and finished with an antique glaze. The smaller ones were covered with enamel paint; the large ringed candles were stained in walnut finish with an antique glaze added. Flowers, fruits, greens, and ribbons were used to decorate them. Some of the sisters made their own candles where a particular color and size was needed.

And Ardell Ross Artificial fruit, pine cones, and leaves, sprayed gold, and attractively arranged, form the basis for Ardell Ross' Christmas table. The red candles are even more striking when the table is set with red dishes. A dark green, many-branched _ tree, with multi-colored _ lights, stands near the end of the table and sheds a soft light upon the table. An almost feathery effect is created by the use of pink lights on a white tree. Red poinsettias and golden doves contrast and blend with the pink and white. Around Christmas time it seems fitting that we use as decoration in our homes some reminder. Of that joyful occurrence we commemorate at the Christmas season. Anyone can buy beautiful decorations, but how much more meaning will something beautiful you made yourself have to you and your family! Materials needed: 1. Plaster of Paris heads, hands, and feet for Joseph, Mary, and Jesus (these were 3%\" high for Joseph, 3\" for Mary and 2\" for Jesus). They came with matching plaster hands and feet, except for the baby; for him you may use plastic hands. 2. Styrofoam cones, one 21\" tall for Joseph, and one 10\" tall for Mary (remember she is seated). 3. Cotton fabric and white water solvent glue or cotton pre-treated draping fabric available at craft stores. 4. Wire strong but bendable and a good quality glue. 5. Paint in desired colors, antiquing, and spray glaze. Transparency by J M.

Open House Utah State Fair September 11-20, 1970 Under a General Board committee, with Edythe K. Watson as chairman, the Olympus Stake Relief Society Board, with the cooperation of Stake President LeGrand Curtis, prepared this beautifully arranged and informative display. The oil paintings by Clyde Smith (of Olympus Stake) represented the courses of study and services of Relief Society: visiting teaching, compassionate service, Singing Mothers, spiritual living, social relations, and cultural refinement. The artist painted the pictures especially for the display at the fair. They are 30 inches by 48 inches, and all the models are from Olympus Stake. Homemaking arts were illustrated and displayed on a long table covered with an attractive deep blue cloth. Seated on the rocker is Lola J. Peterson, President, Olympus Stake Relief Society, demonstrating the making of an afghan. Continuous demonstrations were given which awakened the interest of those who visited the fair and learned more about Relief Society from narrations presented by stake board members and ward Relief Society officers. 925 Homemaking Display at Relief Society Annual General Conference Views of the Homemaking Display held in the Salt Palace, Salt Lake City, Utah, as a part of the 1970 Relief Society Annual General Conference. The center motif was a carousel, with different displays featured around the large hall. The carousel itself was prepared by Emigration Stake under the direction of President Hazel J. Young. Dorotha Smart supervised the construction of the carousel and was assisted in the displays by JaNeanne Webster. Featured around the carousel were items prepared by stakes throughout the Church. The displays included home and gift items, handicraft, foods, pastry and candy, as well as ne items especially designed for children.

Also, they had an appropriate sign made to be placed above the front entrance. \"You have no idea what this will mean to the children of this town,\" Geniel remarked to Miss Blayney one afternoon. \"Some of them are simply starved for good books.\" \"T think perhaps I do,\" she replied. \"I used to read everything I could get my hands on when I was a child, and it wasn't very much. I always went through the school reader the first week I had it. 'Then I was bored for the rest of the term. I even read old almanacs.\" Thank goodness, thought Geniel. Otherwise, she wouldn't have been so sympathetic to this cause. By the time she was completely well again, Miss Blayney had_perfected her plans for moving to California. Geniel had rather hoped that she would leave before they took over the rooms for the library, but that was asking too much.

The mothers of the PTA served punch and cookies, and it was a highly successful affair. \"T've never secn Miss Blayney quite so much in her element in all the years I've been here,\" observed Christine. \"In fact, she was having such a good time that I shouldn't be surprised to see her stay on for good.\" \"She is keeping the upstair rooms intact for her lifetime just in case she does get homesick and wants to return. We can't blame her for that. It's sometimes hard for older people to adjust to a new place and way of living,\" Geniel added. Miss Blayney seemed to be very much afraid of just that but, after considerable hesitation, she finally departed for California to give the new life a try, at least. \"Spring was the wrong time for her to leave here,' said Marva dubiously. \"But she may just love it down there.

I always went through the school reader the first week I had it. 'Then I was bored for the rest of the term. I even read old almanacs.\" Thank goodness, thought Geniel. Otherwise, she wouldn't have been so sympathetic to this cause. By the time she was completely well again, Miss Blayney had_perfected her plans for moving to California.
