Sample 29 is exceptional (95/100) with zero errors. The primary remaining errors are character substitutions (7 instances) and word-level garbles (6 instances), particularly affecting proper nouns and common words. Notable problematic words include: 'Ldie' (Jamie), 'Ees S' (Jem S), 'Wunthrop' (Winthrop), 'EAREST' (DEAREST), 'wany' (want), 'yu' (you), and 'Owifter Shan a' (appears to be title corruption). The cleanup process has been moderately effective but appears to have missed opportunities to correct clearly identifiable errors, particularly in section titles and proper nouns. No critical structural damage overall, but targeted improvements in proper noun correction and header OCR recovery would substantially improve batch quality."
