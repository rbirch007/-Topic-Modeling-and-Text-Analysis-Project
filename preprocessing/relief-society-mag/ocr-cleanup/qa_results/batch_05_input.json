But Jamie had heard Momie say, \"I've lost my file,\" and there was the cutest little file in this manicure set.

Then, taking a long breath, he opened his eyes wide and looked at the price tag. One dollar and thirtyfive cents.

But, she reminded herself, these were boys he had grown up with, while she was regarded as a fulfillment of all the horrible creatures stepmothers had ever been made out to be, someone you must never speak to unless it was absolutely necessary. Rusty perched himself on an overturned bucket. Marian watched him with a heavy heart, knowing that he would stay there, or somewhere else away from the house, as long as he could. She noticed that Patty was coming down the walk from the corner grocery, where she had sent her on an errand. Her heart went out to the slim girl with the bag of groceries. It had been so easy to win her confidence. Like Robbie, she had come to her with open arms. She looked again at Rusty, and suddenly she was seized with new determination to win him, as she had done the others. She opened the door and started toward the bucket, her mind grasping frantically for something she could say or do that would bring results. Her eyes traveled rapidly over anything that might give her a hint. They suddenly came to halt on the grinning features of a bucket head, lying at the edge of the pile. She grasped at the suggestion it offered. \"This one looks like Lancelot,\" she said, picking it up. \"Did you make it?\" - Her newborn hopes were smashed as quickly as they were born.

She watched with envy their goodbyes. One boy, with numerous brown freckles and a pug nose, slapped Rusty on the back. \"See yu tomorrow, pal,\" he said with perfect confidence at tomorrow's welcome. \"Sure,\" Rusty answered, with a grin that reminded her of his father, \"you can be that Green Knight the teacher read us about if you remember what I told you.\" She saw them take leave of Rusty, their leader, who was as free and easy as though he never would shut himself away from anyone. But, she reminded herself, these were boys he had grown up with, while she was regarded as a fulfillment of all the horrible creatures stepmothers had ever been made out to be, someone you must never speak to unless it was absolutely necessary.
