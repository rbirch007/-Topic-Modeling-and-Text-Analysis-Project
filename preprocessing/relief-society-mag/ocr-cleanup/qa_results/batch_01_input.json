Our Christmas gifts need not be costly, and when they show the stamp of individual work they are all the more desirable. But they should not be burdensome in the making-. The woman who sito up the greater part of each night some weeks prior to Christmas is making a toil of what should be joy. The gift drawer or box is not only a preventive of this, but is also a constant reminder to all the family of the Christmas spirit throughout the year. It gives a better chance too for us to notice what gifts would give most pleasure. A summer call on a friend reveals the lack of holders for her flowers, her desire for a certain book is learned during a conversation, or perhaps a meal at another friend's house reveals the value to her of a set of table mats. They are listed in the gift book and are sometimes picked up during a vacation trip, or the mats are one of the many pieces of needlework raised to the dignity of \"a reason for being made\" instead of just to pass the time.

Take notice of the wide difference in shades and tints of green by sunlight, shadow, twilight, moonlight, and by starlight. These should be studied. Green is persistent, its colour shows strongly at night, or by lamplight. Note the difference in sage-brush green with its blue tendency. The alfalfa in strong sunlight shows more yellow. The apple green also has the same warm tone of yellow. The sage and willow we call cool greens, the alfalfa and apple green in sunlight are the warm greens. Look out on the fields and note the cool green in oat patches, and try to analyse the difference of tone in the various kinds of grain.
