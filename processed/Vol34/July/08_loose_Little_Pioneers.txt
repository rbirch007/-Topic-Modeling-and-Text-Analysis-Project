LITTLE PIONEERS Ethel Van Hook Hopper What did the little children do Along the weary way? As wagons rolled across the plains, They could not run and play. They watched the sky, the tall wild grass. They called it waves at sea; They played the wagon was a ship; The wind was blowing free. At last, the queer bark anchored fast; The children ran about, So glad to feed the tired animals, To build the fires... And shout. When quiet night came down at last, They sang sweet songs, we know, Cheering the ones about the fire In the evenings long ago.
