fourth of July of this year. The conscience and soul of the American Nation have been kept living and chastened by the movements of pioneers into the unknown West since the time when Thomas Hooker, in 1636, took his group of people from Plymouth into a far western territory which became known as the colony of Connecticut. In the beginning of the nineteenth century, when the American pioneers moved farther westward, there was always a rebirth of national conscience, the conquest of the soil, and the building of cities and schools. The monument to the pioneers is a beautiful memorial, the fine qualities of which can scarcely be better described than by the words of Paul Cret: In a memorial the end to be achieved, primarily, is the perpetuation of the memory of a great man or a great event to future generations. This object being granted, it follows that permanency and a clear and arresting expression of the commemorative idea are essential to the programme, and the most appropriate memorial is that which may best withstand the changes of the centuries, and by the beauty and dignity of its design arouse to the attention and respect the heedless mind of the wayfarer and that of the wayfarer still to come. Mahonri Young was bor in the Twentieth Ward of Salt Lake City, August 7, 1877. His father, after whom Mahonri was named, was a son of President Brigham Young. His mother was Agnes MacIntosh, born of a distinguished pioneer family who migrated to Utah in 1849. He had little formal scholastic training, but his interpretation of external life was at once his strength and enduring power. The habits, tastes, and associations of his youth have swayed him through his life. As he sat on the banks of the little creek which flowed past his home in his boyhood days, he laughed and talked with his companions�Lee Greene Richards, Alma Wright, and Jack Sears, all of whom gave vibrant expression to youthful dreams of life. Born of upright, self-respecting parents, he always preferred the companionship of workers to that of men of leisure. The first subjects that he did in sculpture were men who had strength of body and mind, and nothing appealed to him so much as men of rich spirituality. To this day, he is warm-hearted, generous to a fault, lavish on anything connected with his work, simple in tastes and habits of life, affectionate, and home-loving. He has been a prop age 435 436 MAHONRI M. YOUNG found student of the Bible, and his knowledge of the world's best literature has won him friends from among professional men, doctors, and theologians of different sects and religions. MAHONRI YOUNG is acknowledged to be one of the greatest sculptors of our day. He acquired his technical training in Paris at the Institute and Ecole des Beaux Arts after having studied in New York where he went when he was twenty-two years of age, and came under the influence of such men as Saint Gardens and Daniel French. During his student years, he was particularly interested in men as they labored in construction gangs, and he made innumerable bronzes and etchings of men at work. Studies in bronze of boxers are other works of his earlier period. Examples of Mr. Young's sculptures are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where his bronzes "Stevedore" and "Man with a Pick" are on display. "A Laborer" and "The Rigger" are in the Free Public Library of Newark, New Jersey. For the Museum of Natural History in New York, he made the Hopi, Apache, and Navajo groups. His many notebooks of etchings and drawings fill several shelves in his library, and tell us much about his intensity of perception, and the extraordinary feeling and sympathy which characterize his work. He has been awarded highest honors throughout this country, in Paris, Buenos Aires, and Panama. His famous "Monument to the Dead" is in Paris. He is a member of the National Academy, the Society of American Etchers, the New York Water Color Society, the Institute of Fine Arts and Letters, the National Arts Club, and the Century Club of New York City. In the flower garden of Temple Square in Salt Lake City, are two of his finest creations. They are Joseph Smith, the Mormon Prophet, and his brother Hyrum, both life-size, on granite pedestals. 'The figures are bathed in the soft light of surrounding shadows of trees and flowers, giving them a beautiful setting. The Prophet stands with book in hand, ready to tell about the sacred scriptures, which explain the holiness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. His face is resolute, yet there is an expression of hallowed thought. Both men stand with a dignity of true greatness. The spiritual aroma of Hyrum's features, his expressive face of deep humility and simple faith, seem to give a feeling of praying as he looks into the light of a new day. MAHONRI M. YOUNG 437

STATUES OF PATRIARCH HYRUM SMITH (LEFT) AND THE PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH (RIGHT), TEMPLE SQUARE, SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH Mahonri M. Young, Sculptor 438 T was during the latter part of the month of May, 1848, that crickets began to destroy the wheat fields far and wide. At first little thought was given to the pest, but, within a few days, a devouring horde swept down upon the Valley, eating everything before them, leaving neither blade nor leaf. Bancroft, the historian, says: Men, women, and children turned out en masse to combat the pest, driving them into ditches or upon piles of reeds, which they would set on fire, striving in every way, until their strength was exhausted, to beat back the devouring host. The crickets increased alarmingly every day. The people prayed and fasted for they had great faith as they begged their God for help. Many hundreds of immigrants were on the plains between the Rocky Mountains and the Missouri River, and were expected during the summer. One company had reached Fort Bridger, and was told by messengers of the terrible plight in the Valley: Then a miracle happened. There came from the islands of the Great Salt Lake the gulls�myriads of these strange, snow-white birds, with wild cries�winging their way. A new fear arose in the hearts of the people as they saw the birds settling down upon the fields�a fear that another foe had come to complete the destruction of the growing grain. Great was their joy when they saw the gulls pounce upon the black crickets and begin to gorge themselves so ravenously that the birds, over THE SEA GULL MONUMENT, TEMPLE SQUARE, SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH Mahonri M. Young, Sculptor MAHONRI M. YOUNG stuffed by their rapid and heavy feeding, would regurgitate their spoil, and then continue devouring the pest. Men and women gazed in amazement upon the birds and their beneficent work. God had answered their prayers. For days the destruction went on, then the winged deliverers, having destroyed the plague, quietly flew back to their island homes in the bosom of the Great Salt Lake. The people had been saved from starvation. On Wednesday, October 1, 1913, the beautiful monument. In honor of the gulls was unveiled in Salt Lake City. The monument consists of a granite pedestal, upon which rests a graceful column over sixteen feet high, on the top of which is a large granite ball. Upon this, gulls are gently alighting. The birds are done in bronze, covered with gold leaf, and the group weighs nearly five hundred pounds. Around the foot of the pedestal is a beautiful fountain about thirty feet in diameter and in the water swim hundreds of goldfish. On each of three sides of the pedestal is a bronze plaque picturing a scene in the Valley during those pioneer days. The first relief shows the beginning of agriculture in the arid West. The desert is dry and parched. From the sagebrush run lizards and horned toads. A camp has been made, and a woman, the ever-constant companion of man, is preparing the noonday meal. The figures are aglow with warm, pulsating life. Oxen are plunging ahead with plow, while the man guides them, and the boy urges them on with lash and word. Determination marks the faces of the figures, and the charm of the bronze relief is in the vivid 439 impression it conveys. They must not hesitate. 'The virgin soil must be reclaimed. Wheat must be sown and potatoes planted. The oxen partake of the spirit of the people, for they bend hard to their yokes, as they tug at the plow. An Indian sits by watching the work, and on his face is a look of wonderment. He will know again the use of the virgin soil, as did his forefathers. It is savagery meeting civilization in the wilderness. The entire ensemble gives one the feeling of faith, work, and hope. The second relief tells a dramatic story. Crickets are devouring the wheat fields. Hundreds of acres have been wasted. Men, women, and children have fought for days to destroy the pest but to no avail. A man is sitting with bowed head. His agonizing prayer has been heard, but he is fatigued with the work and worry of many days and nights. Near him is a woman holding a little child by the hand. There is a simple unconscious grace to the figure, and her appearance is symbolic of maternal purity. She stands in majestic silence, and on her face is a look of supreme faith in God. It is of such women that Benjamin Ide Wheeler once wrote: Over rude paths beset with hunger and risk, she passed on toward the vision of a better country. To an assemblage of men busy with the perishable rewards of the day, she brought the three-fold leaven of enduring society�faith, gentleness, and home with the nurture of children. The third bronze shows the harvest days. The wheat fields have been saved, and the people shall have bread. They praise God for their deliverance. The whole relief exhales a spirituality very beautiful. 440 One senses the protective grace of the Almighty, who has a far greater work for these children of the wilderness to do. The gulls are the saviors, and the destiny of the colony is assured by a miracle. Children play for joy, and the entire scene is resonant of sunshine. The fundamental industry of their new colony will be agriculture�the beautifying of the land and making it productive and useful. The men have conquered the elements, and God has sent them his blessings and help in time of sore distress. The fourth tablet, on the north, reads: "SEA GULL MONUMENT ERECTED IN GRATEFUL REMEM. BRANCE OF THE MERCY OF GOD TO THE MORMON PIONEERS" This memorial has won more admirers that perhaps any other of the sculptor's work. It conveys a human story with such precision and tender sincerity that all can read it and few can fail to be affected. IN his etchings and drawings, we may study the character of the artist. His intensity of perception is shown in the drawing of the first school in Utah, taught by Marty Jane Dilworth. In it one notes the extraordinary feeling and sympathy for his subject. The school was held in a tent shaped like an ordinary Indian wigwam. Rough logs were used for seats and the teacher's desk was a camp stool, which had been brought across the plains from Winter Quarters. A description of the school comes down to us in the memoirs of Maria Nebeker, a sister of Mary Jane. She writes: I attended the first school in Utah taught by my sister Mary Jane. The school was opened just three weeks after our arrival in the valley. I remember Mary Jane saying to us: "Come children, come. We will begin now." We entered the tent, sat down on the logs and one of the brethren offered prayer. In the simple drawing we see the enduring genius of youth ever struggling to learn. It is a scene of everyday life, of tender expression. The boy with bowed head is listening to the opening prayer. -; On the building of the Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph Company, at First South and State Streets, Salt Lake City, is a plaque made by Mr. Young of the old Salt Lake Theatre which has been demolished. Significantly beautiful, it shows the people of the sixties entering the playhouse. The women wear hoop skirts, the men frock coats. In front are the horse carriages and cabs used seventy years ago. The sculptor has preserved the spirit of the old playhouse and on the plaque are these words of Thomas Moore: Long, long be my heart with such memories filled, Like the vase in which roses have once been distilled, You may break, you may shatter the vase if you will, But the scent of the roses will hang round it still. THE "This Is the Place' Monument, to be unveiled on the Twenty-fourth of July, will be one of the largest of its kind in the United States. Placed at the mouth of Emigration Canyon, the setting of the monument with the hills and mountains as a background, gives a feeling of its majesty amid the spaciousness of earth and sky. MAHONRI M. YOUNG  THE JOHN PACK HOME, SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH Sketch by Mahonri M. Young In this building the first sessions of the University of Deseret were held. The base is of granite from the Cottonwood quarries, and upon it will be mounted the bronze groups of the figures and mammoth bronze panels in bas-relief. Nearly one hundred bronze portraits of heroic proportions retell the history of the settlement of Utah and the West. In bronze relief on the west side of the base, the sculptor portrays the
