Call It a Day Estelle Webb Thomas WHEN the early summer dawn began to break, Judith was already carrying water from the spring below the hill. She set the heavy wooden buckets down for a moment when she reached her fence and looked off across the  valley. In this sweet, translucent light it was almost too beautiful. "It's my home!" thought Judith exultantly, and wondered if it were wicked to be so happy. "But they'd want me to be happy," she mused, unlatching the crude gate and picking up the pails, "Sam and all of them." She poured the water into the copper boiler, only slightly dented by its long trip across the plains, and, setting it on the three blackened stones, began the complicated process of making a fire under it. Gramp usually made the fires, carefully banking them in the wintertime, saving coals for months at a time, and using his flint in the summer; but she particularly wanted Gramp to sleep this morning. Even as the thought crossed her mind, a terrific booming roar shattered the silence and shook the earth. "That Tom Planter!" Judith spoke aloud in her vexation, "I knew he'd fire off that old  cannon before it had rightly come morning! Why can't he let the little ones and the old ones have their rightful rest? Now I'll never get my wash done and ironed!" She thought ruefully that she would have been well into it now, if she could have carried the water last night, but then it was Sunday, and one could not work on the Sabbath. It was hard on a body, she reflected, when a Sunday was followed immediately by a holiday and one's family must be spick and span for both occasions, with never a change to their backs! Usually, Judith solved the problem quite simply by laundering Gramp's and the two children's clothing before they were awake mornings, except for Sunday, when the wardrobes were prepared after they were abed Saturday night. Luckily, she had two dresses, her old linsey-woolsey on which she had learned to weave, and her best brown, dyed with oak bark, for Sundays. Three dresses, to be exact, but she had never worn the sprigged muslin since the day she and Sam were married. It lay now in the bottom of her little rawhide-covered trunk, wrapped in a yellowed old linen sheet of her mother's, with dried lavender tucked in the folds, waiting, perhaps, for little Sabina to become a starry-eyed bride. She was climbing the hill with her second "turn" of water, when she heard Gramp calling her. "Sairy Ann, Sairy Ann, where in tarnation be ye?" "Coming, Gramp!" Judith's clear voice was reassuring, and she began hurrying so that some of her precious water slopped out. She answered as readily to "Sairy Ann" as to any other of the half-dozen names Gramp called her. Gramp was ninety-two and likely to confuse Judith, in 446 moments of stress, with the various women in his past. He was standing now by her washing fire, clutching a large plaid shawl about his thin shoulders. "Where in tarnation's my shirt?" he greeted her, fretfully, "been huntin' my fool head off and 'taint nowhere!" "I'm washing it, Gramp! 'Today's the Twenty-fourth, remember? You have to be nice and clean today!" "Stuff and nonsense! It was clean yistidy�wasn't yistidy Sunday? Well, then, I never done no work, how in tunket would I git dirty?" "Well, it wasn't rightly dirty," Judith soothed him, "but today's extra special for you, Gramp. You know youre the chaplain of the day and have to give the oration. Everybody'll be looking at you!" GRAMP looked instantly mollified, and a pleased, self conscious smile twitched the corners of his toothless mouth. "Well now, I plumb forgot that there oration! Now, why in tunket you s'pose they picked on me? Why don't they git Brother Sweigert? He'sa durn sight long windeder 'n what I be!" "You don't have to be long winded, Gramp!" Judith assured him, quickly, "the poor youngsters nearly starved last time Brother Sweigert orated. You just give them one of your good, lively talks�that's what they want! Better keep off the 'Other Side' in your oration, or they'll think it's a funeral sermon!" "Never you mind 'T'other Side," retorted Gramp, good-naturedly, "when you git as clost to "T'other Side' as I be, you'll be thinkin' a lot about it, too. Sometimes I can't hardly wait," he went on, to himself, busy with his flint and punk, "seems like I can almost see 'em all troupin' to meet me! Yessir, that'll be a happy day fer me, a happy day!" Judith and Gramp accomplished miracles in the next few hours. While Judith's washing was flapping on the line, she washed and fed the children, four-year-old Sabina, her dark eyes starry with excitement, and sunny-haired, three-year-old Sammy, happy just to be alive. Gramp ate with the children, but Judith was far too busy for food. While she pressed the damp clothes with the one heavy, awkward, sadiron, Gramp polished all the shoes. He did this by the simple expedient of turning a stove lid upside down, pouring water into it, and applying the resulting black paste liberally with a rag. When this dried sufficiently to buff with a piece of wooly sheepskin, the sheen rivaled a new stove. "Whut do the poor souls do that don't have no stove?" he inquired, not expecting nor wanting an answer. "How in thunderation can they polish their shoes on a Dutch oven er fireplace? Yes, Judy, you're a lucky girl, an' I'll tell Sammy so soon as I see him on "T'other Side.' Sammy's the one'll meet me�he wuz allus my favorite, Sam wuz. 'Sammy, you left your wife well fixed,' I'll say, 'if you had to go, it was better you than some shiftless feller, that wouldn't leave nothin." But why did he have to go?" Gramp interrupted himself, turing a piteous gaze on Judith. "If some of us had to die of cholery on them pesky plains, why couldn't it a been me?" Judith had side-stepped that question so often, she answered now almost automatically. "Now, Gramp, the Lord knows who he needs CALL IT A DAY where. And just what would we do without you�this morning, for instance?" Presently, they were en route to the Bowery, a leafy roof constructed by the young men for the day's festivities. Friends and neighbors were swarming toward this center from all directions, all in their Sunday best, and Judith in her freshly pressed homespun dress, her dark hair with its coronet of braids curling softly about her temples, her cheeks pink with excitement and haste, felt the old childish thrill a_ celebration always brought.. After all, one cannot grieve always, at twenty-two. Young Bill Williams had made room for them on the split-log bench beside him, but the Bishop had hustled Gramp up front to be ready for his oration. Judith could feel Bill's blue eyes on her as she gazed off across the green fields. "Those wild roses sure look pretty in your black hair," he whispered as they sat down. "Just match your cheeks!" "Hush, Bill," Judith murmured, distressed, "Brother Jackson's going to pray!" Brother Jackson's prayer was long and comprehensive, but it was a prayer of thanksgiving and praise, and not a thought of weariness entered the bowed heads during the long petition. Even the children felt the grateful necessity of abundant thanks for this haven. Bill whispered again, in the gentle tustle that followed Brother Jackson's "Amen," "When you going to let me come see you, Judith? I could�" "Sh!" Judith knew what he would have said. "I could take good care of you and the children and Gramp." He had said it before. She knew 447 how it hurt Bill to see her working like a man. She knew she could make this new home a veritable heaven for him by giving him the right to care for her and hers. In fact, she knew Bill very well, indeed. It had been "Bill'n Judy" long before dashing Sam Martin and_ his "Gramp," had joined the saints back in Missouri and won Judith. He had even won Bill, too, for the boys had been friends, in spite of their rivalry, up to the dreary day Bill had helped to lower Sam into his wayside grave. Now, as the audience rose for the second song, he murmured, "Sam would be glad�" "Yes, Sam�but not Gramp!"' Judith took off her slat bonnet and, pretending to use it for a fan, whispered from behind it, "It would break Gramp's heart. Be patient, Bill. We're young!" Bill smiled. This was the first encouraging word she had given him. Why, it was practically a promise! He could wait now. The audience sat down. Bill never knew what had been sung, but the Bishop was introducing Gramp as the first speaker, and Gramp's quavering voice was saluting them: "My dear brethren and sisters, friends, neighbors, and feller citizens�" Judith leaned forward, tensely. If only Gramp would stick to the present, or even a recital of the oft-told tale of the journey West! But not Gramp. With despair, she heard him saying, "Well, folks, know what I'm goin to tell 'em when they meet me on "T�other Side?' I'm goin' to say, 'Friends, if you could see them valleys of the mountains the Prophet led us to, you'd begin to wonder who's in heaven�you or us!' " we Ke 448 "�TUDITH! Judith Martin!" Sister Merry's troubled face was peering at her from the edge of the Bowery, and Judith's name was being hissed along the row. "Tl look after the kids," Bill murmured, and Judith slipped out. "Oh, Judy!" Sister Merry wailed, after they were out of hearing, "a terrible thing has happened!" Judith paled, and glanced instinctively toward the Bowery, though she had left Gramp and the children but a moment before. Sister Merry, after an impressive pause, rushed on, "You know Laviny was to sing the solo in the anthem ~�she's the only one can reach it by a yard. Been practicing for weeks!" "Yes?" Judith breathed. What had happened to Lavina?. "Well, listen. She was going to wear Aunt Jane's taffeta�you know her changeable she wore to the Govenor's ball that time. Well, Aunt Jane never would let her try it on. Simply wouldn't get it out of the trunk. Claimed her and Laviny was the same size and she knew it would fit her, without switching it out." Judith could hear Gramp enlarging on the glories of the "Other Side" and, suddenly, it was clear to her that he was looking forward far more eagerly to his advent in that bright land than he ever had to the end of the weary trek which had brought them here. How tired he must be! Tears smarted her eyes and she stared blankly at Sister Merry's dramatic, "So there you are!" "Where?" It was Sister Merry's turn to stare. "You mean you never heard me? Well, as I say, Aunt Jane wouldn't get her taffeta till the last dog was hung, and what da you s'pose? Every single fold was cracked wide open!" "Oh, poor Aunt Jane!" exclaimed Judith. "Oh, poor Laviny, you mean! Been dreaming of wearing that taffeta for a month! Aunt Jane used to boast it could stand alone�was married in it twice and laid both her husbands to rest in it�her wearing it, I mean, not them. Well, as I told her, it'll never stand alone again, but what about poor Laviny? She don't have a second dress to her back!" She hesitated and then, looking Judith squarely in the eyes, demanded, "You know anybody got a dress stored away?" "No-o, I don't believe�oh, you mean my sprigged muslin? Oh, Sister Merry, I�I�you see, Sam and "Sister Judith!" Merry was stern, "You going to let a sprigged muslin stand betwixt you and your Maker? For when ye do it unto the least of these�besides the program will be ruined!" Judith had a wild desire to laugh at this quaint application of scripture, but stifled it and answered quickly, "Of course she must wear it�I didn't realize�send her over to my house and Ill have it shaken out." The anthem was, luckily, the last number on the morning program, but Tom Planter had rendered encores of "Yankee Doodle," his only tune, three times on his mouth organ, and was clearing his throat for a fourth time, and the Bishop was Wiping his brow nervously when Lavina sailed into view, trying to look as if she slipped into a sheer, sprigged muslin every morning of her life. The delay had been caused by the fact that there was a lot more of CALL IT A DAY Lavina than of sprigged muslin, especially around the middle. After much agonized effort on the part of both girls, and violent declarations from Lavina that she would wear it if she had to hold her breath till she burst, Judith had dashed across the fields to Grandma Wilkins', and borrowed a kerchief to fill up the gap. Lavina had wept a little at the necessity, but, as Judith pointed out, it was obviously impossible to reach high C while holding one's breath. So now she tossed her head and walked boldly to the front of the Bowery, with the muslin spliced all the way up the front of the basque with Grandma Wilkins' white silk kerchief. RAMP was in high spirits when Judith, later, served him baked beans and salt rising bread. He had a place of honor at the "long table" where the women's cherished tablecloths were spread out on the grass. He was seated cross-legged near the Bishop, with Sabina and Sammy on each side of him. Judith squeezed his hand. "You did fine, Gramp!" she whispered. Gramp smiled happily. "Never dwelt too much on 'T'other Side,' did I, Marthy? Don't recollect if | even mentioned it, but it seems like I look forrard to it like a little boy to Christmas, er Brother Brigham to sayin' "This Is the Place'�can't help sayin' a little mite once in a while!" "Tt's all right, Gramp, it was a fine speech." Judith felt not the slightest qualm of conscience at this statement, though she had not heard the speech. There were races after dinner, and the Martin family did itself proud. Gramp was winner of the "over- 449 ninety" race, and Sabina runner-up in the four-year-old class. But Sammy went to sleep in his mother's arms in the midst of it all, and so put both of them out of the running. Sunset saw the tireless merrymakers sitting again at the board, with renewed appetite for the beans, mutton, and rice pudding. There was still a night of dancing ahead, and they must keep up their strength. As Judith heaped his plate, Gramp found Opportunity to whisper, "Sairy Ann, I guess I done all right. Brother Sweigert told me he couldn't occupied any more time hisself!"' Gramp was calling for the first quadrille when Judith, after putting Sabina and Sammy snugly into a nest of blankets under a tree where other children were already sleeping, joined the laughing group around the hard-packed earthen "dance floor." "Come on, Judy!" he called, gaily, "Young Bill's been lookin' for a podner! Putty near time for the second set! Swing yore podners to you know where! Now then, young folks, get set lively!" Old Brother Beeson was scraping his fiddle and Johnny Deere and Ben Brown twanging their Jew'sharps, preparatory to bursting into full volume for the next set. Gramp, his eyes dancing, his foot tapping, was waiting impatiently to start calling again. "Aren't you getting Gramp?" Judith asked. "Tired! Stuff and nonsense!" said Grmp, stoutly, "what if I do get tired? Have plenty time to rest on "T'other Side,' I reckon! There's Bill lookin' for ye agin; now get on and leave me be!" tired, 450 At last the moon was down and the last bonfire dying to embers. Men began harnessing and saddling horses and mothers gently roused their sleeping children and prepared to end the great day, Gramp, looking white and frail in the fitful light, appeared at Judith's side. "Hand me Sabiny. Be careful, don't wake her up! I'll tote her." "Oh, Gramp. No! She's too big! She won't cry! Come on, honey, take hold of Gramp's hand, and Mommy'll carry Sammy!" But Gramp was obstinate, and with an effort, he lifted the heavy sleeping child. "Guess I'm still man enough�" he panted. Then Sabina was lifted suddenly and firmly from his trembling arms, and Bill's quiet voice asked, "Any objection to a little help here?" His arm was through his bridle reins, and glancing at his horse, he inquired, "Want to ride, Gramp?" "Not me! I'll do well to get myself home, without foolin' with some pesky critter!" It was the nearest Gramp had ever come to an admission of weakness and Judith glanced at him anxiously. He saw, or divined, the look, and said hastily, "Now, don't go gettin' ideas in your head, Sairy Ann, and callin' someone with a wagon to tote me home. It's only a skip, hop, and jump! Now, get movin' and leave me be!" In spite of her anxiety for Gramp, Judith felt an unaccustomed glow at Bill's nearness and quiet strength. They walked along slowly, tempering their pace to suit Gramp's and talking over the day's events. "You sure gave us a fine speech, Gramp," Bill declared. "Everybody liked it. First time Brother Wallace ever stayed awake through a preaching in his life, I'll bet!" "Wasted a lot of breath on i Gramp muttered, but Judith knew he was pleased. At the cabin, Bill gently placed the sleeping child on Judith's bed and turned to go. "It's too late to ask you in, but I do thank you," murmured Judith as she laid Sammy beside his sister. "Td like to have the right to help you always," he whispered. Judith followed him out and stood watching while he mounted his horse and rode away. Then with a sigh she turned back into the cabin. To her surprise, it was still dark, ee ok & WHAT'S the matter, Gramp, can't you get a light?" she asked, a vague dread sharpening her voice. There was no answer, and starting forward, Judith almost fell over the huddled form on the floor. 'The first necessity was for a light and she forced herself to kneel and search Gramp's pockets for his tinderbox. She found it in his hand and gently disengaged it from the nerveless fingers. It seemed an eternity before she finally struck a spark which would ignite the wick of the tallow candle. She stifled a cry at sight of Gramp's waxen face and glazed, half-closed eyes, but Judith had learned self-control the hard way, and she resolutely put grief aside for the moment. Light and frail as Gramp was, it took all her strength and effort to lift and carry the inert form to his bed in the comer. With immense relief, she saw that he was breathing, although very faintly. She removed his shoes that he had blacked so care- (Continued on page 503)
