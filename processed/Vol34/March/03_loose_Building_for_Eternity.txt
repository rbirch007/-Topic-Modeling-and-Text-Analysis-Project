Building for Eternity Counselor Marianne C. Sharp [Address Delivered at Relief Society General Conference, October 3, 1946] Y dear brothers and sisters, I am grateful for the privilege we have today of meeting in a general Relief Society conference; and I wish to thank my Heavenly Father, also, for the privilege I have of working under the leadership of Sister Spafford in the Relief Society, which I love so much. I also love, honor, and respect Sister Spafford.. I would ask for an interest in your faith and prayers for the few minutes that I shall speak, that the spirit of the Lord may be with us. I have enjoyed very much, as Sister Garff did, meeting with many of you in our recent Relief Society conventions. Whenever I meet faithful Relief Society members I always feel close to them, as I do to you who are gathered here in the Tabernacle this afternoon. For, while we differ in outward appearances and circumstances, still, we hold the same great fundamental concept of life, and we are all striving for the same goal�salvation and exaltation with our families in the celestial kingdom. I say, with our families, for whenever a group of mothers is gathered together, their children are always with them in thought. We can never be fully happy without them. As we have been sitting here this afternoon, and in the previous meetings, I feel sure that our thoughts have been with our children, wondering how they are managing in our absence. Many of the prayers which have been given by our sisters have remembered our families who are at home. Whenever we hear any words of truth that spur us on to better living, we always wish our children were with us to hear them. Anything we have that is fine and good, we want to share with them. There are a few words which always are close to the heart of all mankind. One of those words is "home." While all married women are not given the blessing of bringing children into this world, still, every married woman, with her husband, is given the opportunity of building an eternal home which may influence for good all those who enter. When I say the word "home," I imagine there flashes on the inner eye of each of us a picture, which will vary even in members of an immediate family. And, when I say a picture, I don't mean a material picture of a large, stately home, or a small cottage, as the case may be. | am not referring to a picture built of bricks and mortar, but to the spiritual home which each married couple creates. You will remember the Lord spoke to Samuel in reference to judging men and said, "for man looketh on the outward appearance. But the Lord looketh on the heart" (I Sam. 16:7). So, I refer not to the outward appearance of these homes of ours, but to the true spiritual home which each married couple Page 15 152 creates, a home built not of material wealth, but built of the riches of eternity. I believe when we say the word "home," the first thing we think of is the home built for us by our parents, the homes of our childhood, and then, second, the homes which we are now in the process of creating. Our first homes, our childhood homes, stand completed, built by our parents; and we are the fruits of their building. We might ask ourselves the question�will our homes, when completed, be as beautiful and enduring as the homes of our parents, and are we eager to have our children pattern their homes after those we are creating? The answers to these questions will depend upon the excellence of our building. First and foremost, are our homes built on the everlasting foundation of the eternal marriage covenant, so that all members of the family will be forever bound together in a family unit? Then, are our homes filled with the spirit of love, so full that some overflows into the homes of our neighbors? Are our homes illumined throughout by the light of the gospel, or are there shadowy corners and dark chambers, wherein the light of the gospel cannot penetrate? Is the atmosphere in our homes kept pure and wholesome by adherence to gospel principles? Are the spiritual bodies of the members of the household being adequately nourished by the spirituality in the home? Are the fathers, the heads of our households, recognized as such, and as bearers of the Priesthood? Are we, as mothers, meriting the utter confidence placed in us by our young children, and, as they grow to maturity, will we be growing in spirituality so that we will continue to merit their confidence? Are our children being nourished by family and individual prayer? Are they growing with the growth of their testimonies? Are they being given the opportunity of renewing their covenants by attendance at sacrament meeting? Are their spiritual bodies becoming expanded through the exercise of love, patience, and understanding? For true it is, that the greatest spiritual growth of our families will depend upon the spirituality fed them in the home; and we can depend upon no other source of spirituality for them. Thus, it is our duty to see that we feed them the bread of life. As we grow older, we are better able to evaluate and appreciate the homes of our childhood: and we realize, more keenly, the mighty power of example as set us by our parents. We realize, also, that the great cardinal virtues are not mere words, abstract words, but that they are little commonplace incidents in our childhood. As I remember happenings in my childhood, telling the truth meant not even telling a falsehood on April Fool's Day. Attendance at sacrament meeting meant a cold walk on a bitter winter night, to meet with a household of saints in the hospitable home of Senator Smoot, for the blessed privilege of partaking of the sacrament once in two weeks. You will all recall similar experiences in your childhood, which have guided you throughout your lives. By setting the example in small (Continued on page 214)
