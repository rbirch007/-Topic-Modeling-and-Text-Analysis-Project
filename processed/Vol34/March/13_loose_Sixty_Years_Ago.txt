Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, March 1, and March 15, 1887 "For THE RIGHTS OF THE Women OF ZION AND THE RIGHTS OF THE Women OF ALL NATIONS" ADVICE TO GIRLS: Young ladies, you must perceive now that you have superior advantages to improve your minds and advance in the scale of intelligence to those who have lived in generations before you. It is necessary that you should hasten to step to its use; order and refinement are required in the chamber for the arrangement of the bed and furniture, but still more varied and numerous are the duties of the kitchen.... The necessity of industry, the obligation of each girl to work for her living, her happiness and her home, nothing is more valuable than to learn to work systematically and economically. �D. F. Cox THE MORAL EFFECT OF HURRY: To the thoughtful, the moral consequences of tension and hurry are very saddening; to the physician their results are a matter of profound concern; their grave evils come under his daily observation �London Lancet FROM GRANTSVILLE, UTAH: The sisters of Grantsville are trying to obey the counsel of Brigham Young in regard to storing grain. 'They are also trying to retrench from everything that is likely to injure them. The Relief and Retrenchment Societies are doing well. The former has over two hundred bushels of wheat stored away.... In our sewing meetings we always introduce subjects of conversation pertaining to matters of interest to us as a body of people, and no gossip is ever allowed or introduced.... The dancing parties here are closed at ten o'clock in the evening.... Out city fathers are trying with all their might to keep liquor stores out of Grantsville. We are trying to do as much good as we can, not forgetting the Temple by any means. ~M. A. House, Sec'y. FROM SPRINGDALE, KANE COUNTY: The weather is warm and beautiful; the almond and apricot trees are all in bloom, and nature's aspects are pleasant and delightful. The people feel to praise God for His abundant mercies�Mrs. S. K. Greene A TRUE LADY: Beauty and style are not the surest passports to respectability� some of the noblest specimens of womanhood the world has ever seen have presented � the plainest and most unprepossessing appearance. A woman's worth is to be estimated by her real goodness of heart and the purity and sweetness of her character.... She has a higher purpose in life than to flaunt her finery in the streets�Anon. GEORGE ELIOT: George Eliot is at work again on a new novel. It is said she feels very much disappointed that Middlemarch is considered better than Daniel Deronda. She herself regards this novel as her masterpiece. She produced her first original work eighteen years ago, and the whole product of the sale of her books is estimated at $165,000. OPINION: Dr. Holland thinks that the cure for gossip is culture. He says good-natured people talk about their neighbors only because they have nothing else to talk about. Page 180 Woman�s Sphere Ramona W. Cannon TT\EATH has recently claimed three noble women: Mrs. Alice Kimball Smith, faithful wife and widow of former President Joseph F. Smith of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Mrs. F. I. Jones, one of the courageous band of pioneer women who settled Bluff, Utah, and later, one of the first two women to begin the settlement of Monticello, Utah; Mrs. Carrie Jacobs Bond, of California, who, after living a hard life for many years, won success by composing such favorite songs as "I Love You Truly" and "A Perfect Dav." M RS. WINIFRED KIMBALL HUDNUT, granddaughter of Heber C. Kimball of pioneer fame, and widow of the world-famous manufacturer of cosmetics and per-fumes, Richard Hudnut, managed, through foresight, to save from the Nazis, in their subsequent occupation of her forty-four-room French chateau, a fabulous collection of antiques. There are historic Gobelin tapestries, rare furniture, priceless paintings, precious porcelains, exquisite shawls, and draperies. All these Mrs. Hudnut wishes to give to the State of Utah, if it will build an appropriate edifice to house them in Salt Lake City. ALL but three Latin American countries named as their choice for the year's outstanding poet, Gabriela Mistral of Chile, a charming, high-souled woman, an educator, and a diplomat. The first Chilean woman to serve as a consul, she has, as such, represented her country in Naples, Madrid, Lisbon, and Petropolis, Brazil. A stirring romance, which grew out of the war, is that of the former Suzanne Borel, recently first lady of France, and her husband, Georges Bidault. They met on the underground while he was chief of the national resistance movement. She, under his direction, was per-forming feats fraught with the ut-most danger and requiring skill, finesse, and strategy. Later, when he was minister of foreign affairs in France, she became director of his personal cabinet. Madam Bidault, one of the notable interior decora-tors of France, is also an outstanding linguist, speaking, among many foreign tongues, Chinese and Russian. WHEN our new National Congress met in Washington, the following women took their seats: Katherine St. George, New York; Margaret Chase Smith, Maine; Georgia Lusk, New Mexico; Edith Nourse Rogers, Massachusetts; Frances Bolton, Ohio; Mary T. Norton, New Jersey; Helen Gahagen Doug-las, California. EDITORIAL 9 VOL. 34 MARCH 1947 Proper Conduct in Church Services President Joseph Smith stated that the business of the conference had closed, and the remainder would be donated to instruction. It is an insult to a meeting for persons to leave just before its close. If they must go out, let them go half an hour before. No gentleman will go out of a meeting just at closing. THE above quotation was taken from the Documentary History of the Church, and is part of the instructions given to members of the Church by the Prophet Joseph Smith at the close of conference held in April 1843. Those of us who attended both the Relief Society conference and Church conference held last October, observed the large numbers of people who, five to ten minutes before the close of the sessions, rose and left the meetings, creating a considerable disturbance and drawing attention to themselves and away from the speaker, or from the announcements being made from the stand. It is, indeed, as the Prophet said, an insult to the meeting to leave before its close. 'There are occasionally justifiable reasons for leaving before the benediction has been pronounced on a Church service. Certainly, people should not deny themselves the opportunity of attending conference or Church because they must leave a little early to catch a train, or for some other reason just as valid. However, more often than Page 182 not, people leave to avoid the rush which follows the closing of any gathering where large numbers of people are assembled. One rarely sees anyone leave the theater or concert hall before the final curtain, or before the last note has been played. People usually stay, not only because of their interest, but also out of respect for those who are performing before them,-as well as out of consideration for others in attendance who are interested in remaining until the end. Should we not, then, have even greater respect for those persons speaking at and conducting Church services in the name of the Lord? Aside from the disrespect we show those who are presiding over any Church service, when we leave early, we are depriving ourselves of the blessings pronounced in the closing prayer. The closing prayer constitutes part of the service. The benedictions of conference are especially important to us as Church members. We should not forfeit our right to them for the sake of the few minutes gained by leaving before the benediction is pronounced. Should we not, as Relief Society women, and mothers, set an example for our children, as well as other Church members, by remaining respectfully quiet through all Church services we attend, until their completion?
