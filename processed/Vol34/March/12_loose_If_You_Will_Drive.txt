If You Will Drive Dorothy Clapp Robinson OONLIGHT peeped shyly M through the open doorway of the sod shanty and, immediately, began pushing back at the shadows. Becky Lander sat up in bed. Two years, one month, and eight days�and she was trying to sleep. Reaching for her wrapper, she slipped it over her head, then stooped to pull on her heavy shoes. At the door, she turned for a quick look at the children. Little Becky slept with her, but five-year-old Alex had a trundle bed of his own. Jake would smile at that trundle. She had never been handy with tools, but it was usable, thanks to Martha Baker. Always, always thanks to someone. Never anything accomplished by herself. A stone's throw from her door, a dilapidated wagon flaunted its patched cover, its warped boards, its spliced tongue. How Ingeborg Jensen had brought it this far was a miracle. She and her cow had pulled it all the way from Nauvoo. Last week, Captain Williams had insisted she put her cow with Ingeborg's, and follow his company into Winter Quarters. "You have been here two years," he had said. "There is no need in your waiting for your husband's return. You can meet him in Salt Lake Valley as well as here. Sister Jensen is strong and willing, and she will help you." That was before word had come that a group of men from the Battalion were returning. From beneath the wagon, a head Page 172 rose above the bedding on which Ingeborg slept. Becky stepped quickly back into her room. Couldn't she make a move without someone watching? When the shadow under the wagon was again unbroken, Becky stepped quickly outside and, without sound of going, made her way along a path that led to the river. At the edge of a grove, she hesitated, her assurance gone, her body taut with fear. In spite of being alone the last two years, she was afraid of the woods. With a determined effort, she put one foot ahead of the other, and forced herself to see that the swords and arrows darting about so frighteningly were but shafts of light showing between moving branches. The farther she went, the faster her feet moved. "How wonderful!" She stopped where her fear and the shadows ended, and looked over the silver-varnished prairie. "Oh, Jake, Jake, the years have been so long!" To her left, a few hundred yards away, lay a camp made up of wagons, tents, and a few shanties; a facsimile of the many that marked the brutal trail from Nauvoo to Winter Quarters. Before her, the prairie swept a mile or two, or three, and then dropped abruptly to the lowlands, through which flowed the Musketo. Between the camp and the lowlands, the grass had been cropped close by cattle, and the trail was worn to dust, but Becky's feet skipped lightly over it. On the bluff, she stopped. Sitting on a tuft of IF YOU WILL DRIVE grass, she took her knees between her arms. Below, the river played at hide-and-seek with the darkness. Up here there were no shadows. Two years! She could see the ferry on the far side of the river, 'Two years; and, today, the ferryboat would bring Jake back. Two years, one month, and eight days since he had marched away with the Battalion to fight the Mexicans in California. Only one letter she had had in all that time; but, today, he would be home. Two years, One month, and eight days of being helped by Ingeborg, by Martha Baker, by Angie McDonald, by all the others, until accepting had become gall and wormwood in her soul. Today that would end. From the Start, there had been the matter of food. For some reason, Jake's army pay of seven dollars a month had not reached her. She had managed�with help. She could not move with the company, so the brethren had built her a shanty and moved her into it. Her cow had strayed and had been caught and killed by the Omahas. Brother Parker had taken her calf and raised it until it could live on grass, so now she had a cow again. The new cow, Captain Williams contended, could be yoked with Ingeborg's. No, sir! Becky did appreciate the help so freely given. That is�yes, she did appreciate it. Her heart swelled with pride and thankfulness as she watched the ebb and flow that made up the Camp of Israel. For two years, from her cabin, she had watched her people in wagons, with carts, or just walking, come with the dusk, camp for a night or a week or a month, and disappear into the morning. They were going ahead, 173 making certain the way that led to the Valley, where individual families were already building individual homes. No. It was not that Becky Lander lacked appreciation. She had accepted gratefully, but now that Jake was coming back the accepting was over, and she could raise her head with independence. Again, she was going to inhabit a world of Jake's building. His was to be the voice of decision; his strength was to be her bulwark against disease, Indians, too-kind neighbors, and corroding loneliness. His hand was to provide the bread for their daily sustenance. That was all she wanted. Just a home and the four of them in it. WHEN dawn was beginning to dull the varnish, she returned to her shanty, but not to sleep. Bringing a bucket of water from the trickle that ran through the grove, she wet down her floor. She made a fire in the fireplace and cooked Indian meal for the children's break. Fast. The sack was nearly empty, but she was not worrying this time. When the mush was done and the children still slept, she woke them: but they were cross, and little Becky refused to eat. "Are you home, Sister Lander?" Becky looked up from the: feather bed she was smoothing. Ingeborg Jensen stood in the doorway. Beside her, were her two boys. "I watch," the visitor's voice faltered, "I watch baby vile you go never." Her fine, gray-green eyes pleaded to have some part in this long-anticipated homecoming. "Thank you, Ingeborg, but I am not going to the river." Becky's voice was sharply impersonal. 174 Ingeborg had no judgment. She was without shoes, yet she would quit work to watch little Becky. "Not�going?" After a moment, her face warmed with understanding. "You vait your man comes?" Becky nodded, not trusting herself to speak. She put out her hand and held Alex from going outside. "IT wanta play with Peter," the boy whined. "Some other time. Father is coming today." Alex pushed Peter. "Go home," he said rudely. "I have a father. You haven't." Peter's bland face darkened. He started to retaliate, but his mother caught his arm. "Peter. Hans. Come." She spoke in Danish. "We will go to our work. Alex is excited." Alex had repented quickly. "I wanta go with Peter." The child's tone and words quickened Becky's sense of her own ingratitude. "I'm so sorry," she said, and was grateful for the other woman's quick smile. Playing with the Danisk boys was teaching Alex many necessary lessons. Becky turned again to her bed. With loving care, she smoothed the hand-woven counterpane that was one of the few treasures left from her New England home. With every stroke her heart sang, "Jake is coming." It was not a smooth refrain, for it swelled and ebbed with her movements. She raised the lid of a heavy chest and withdrew a pair of stiffly starched shams. "Jake is coming," the lid cried as it banged in place. This was the first time in more than two years that she had used the shams. She would soon have a home in the Valley, and then she could use them each Sunday. "Jake is coming!" Every whit and parcel of the twelve-by-fourteen room was clothed with the radiance of it. Nota speck of dust remained; the cupboard held unheard of dainties. She had spent hours and hours gathering grapes and berries in the lowlands. Some she had traded at the post for sugar. Everything was ready and waiting, and the sun was not yet above the tops of the eastern trees. "Are you home, Sister Lander?" Martha Baker stood in the doorway, holding something covered with a napkin. "I brought a pie for your dinner." Rebellion was hot in Becky's chest. Martha was desperately poor. Her husband had lost his feet with frost and ice during the exodus across the Mississippi. For days, until the last of the emigrants in his company were safe, he had refused to rest or to remove his wet shoes. Likely the fat that went into the pie was all Martha had, or would have, for a long time to come. "You shouldn't�" she began, but the other cut her short. "Certainly I should. Sharing is the joy of life. I would stay to meet your Jake, but I am washing for the trader's wife." Brushing aside Becky's thanks, she went back across the clearing and through the grove. "Are you still here, Sister Lander?" It was Jennie Call this time. "Thank goodness, you will soon be going West," she said without preamble. "You will soon be in a home, as any self-respecting family should be. This moving would not be so hard, if we could get it over. if YOU WILL DRIVE 1 baked, and thought you would like a loaf. It is good white bread, and well browned, "If I do say so myself "Are you home, Sister Lander?" Edward Parker stopped his team Lucy Parker had brought her most cherished knives, to be used on the days. Ed's seamed, wind-leathered face was broken into lines of anticipation. "We thought you would like to ride to the rivet." Was this to go 0" all day? Why must everyone leave his work to help "T am not going to the river." man's face ever so little. "You are waiting here?" "Yes, Brother Parker. 1! Do not want to meet MY husband with the entire camp watching." "That ls understandable." "Word has come that the returning men were delayed on the Missouri, but they should be She thought he was laughing at her. She would share her bread, but there low the road. Un shirt, his shoulders sagged uneasily. SHE hours refused to pass Becky marked the position of the 175 shadows, and, two hours later, Ot perhaps three, she came back to fin they had moved less than an inch. A queer fright went through het. The Lord had stopped the sun once. Was something momentous happening today other than Jake's com: the floor was already too wet, SO she sprinkled the yard again. She fed the children and put Becky to sleep. Surely, the company could not be this late arriving: Those people at Anger rose, and hardened within her. At least someone might word that he had arrived. As she tried to unroll it. Boots leather boots. Used poots, but with any them. Them. Jake would be pleased, especially that she had They were the size for him�he had small feet�and She rewrapped and 1& placed them. The shanty all in the shadow. Twice she dressed the children in their best clothes, and twice had removed them. 176 Suddenly, she decided to go to the river. If Jake saw her, he would break away from the crowd. She might meet him in the grove. Taking a child by each hand, she started. It was cool and fragrant in the woods, but she did not meet Jake. When she had come through the shadow, the light from the prairie stopped her. As her eyes became accustomed to the light, she could see the lines of the lowlands dark against a westering sun. Camp was deserted, and its air of desolation provoked a strange fear in her. The sun sank lower, and then, on the path that led from the river, she saw moving figures. She watched, and her breath swelled in her throat. Yes! Yes! It was men, four at least. One must be Jake. Behind them, a wagon was just rising from the lowlands. Catching Little Becky up in her arms, she started, half running, back to her shanty. She would meet him there. Alex ran ahead, excited with the race, but not knowing what it was all about. Back in the yard, she set them on boxes to wait. Feverishly, she looked about the cabin for something left undone. There was nothing. The prairie chicken in the oven was done. The table had been set since noon, with clean cloths spread over the dishes to keep the flies away. She heard a grunt, and looked around. Alex had fallen, and was trying to brush the damp earth from his clothes. She shook him vigorously. "Aren't you ashamed, with Father�?" she stopped short. There were voices and the sound of men's feet on the path. It was true, then, it was true. All along she had fought a feeling of defeat, but she had been wrong. He was here! Her knees turned to jelly, and she leaned against the house for support. The long, weary years were over. Now�now was the time to look. She turned her head slowly, as the men entered the clearing. But� but�there was Jim Eckhart who had gone away with Jake, and Captain Williams, and�of course, Jake was in the wagon with Ed Parker. What a scare! "Sister Lander�." She did not hear the words he said. Jim looked so old and travel weary, and there was the shadow of something else in his eyes, but she had no time to worry over that. Why didn't the wagon come? Jim took her hand and started speaking. She heard only snatches. "Coming over the Divide�Indians �killed." He was putting a leather pouch in her hands. "I beg your pardon. Did you say someone was killed?" She was holding the pouch indifferently. The men exchanged glances. She saw that so clearly. She saw their faces darken, as the shadows wrenched the last ray of light from the yard. Someone was buried on a faraway mountain top, and she was holding this pouch. "Dust," Jim said, "gold dust, from the mines of California." IF You WILL DRIVE "Sister Lander, you sleep." BECKY shook off the hands that would have guided her inside. It may have been days, or hours, or minutes later, when a woman's strong arms lifted her bodily and placed her on the bed. She felt a cold cloth on her face. She felt a pull at the something in her hand, but her fingers would not unclasp. Later, she turned her head slowly. Gray dawn was pushing through the doorway, trying to reach the candle that sputtered weakly on the table. She watched, fascinated, as the light filled the room. Queer, that there should be light again. The children were both sleeping in the trundle bed. Ingeborg was sitting at the table, and when she turned her eyes, Becky sat up. An aching awareness ran through her muscles, and from the deepest recesses of her soul came a gnawing emptiness that could never be filled. The long years would go on and on. Becky dropped her feet over the bed, and one struck a burlap-covered package. She raised it to her lap and began unrolling it. When the boots were uncovered in her hands, she held them for long minutes. 'Take them, Ingeborg," she said suddenly. 'They will be large, but they will take you into the Valley." When she looked again, Ingeborg�s head was on her arms, and she was sobbing, quiet sobs, but terrifying in their poignancy. This could not be. Ingeborg was always so calm, so full of faith and patience. Becky touched her on the shoulder. "Why are you crying? What has hurt you?" The woman raised her face. It had turned old and defeated. She wiped her eyes with the corner of her apron. She struggled hard with her English. "All de time-I take." She fingered the leather of the boots. "Nefer do I gif. Always I am taking� always, always. I try keep my cry deep inside." And she, Becky, had resented the Danish woman because of the help she had been given by her. She had resented Martha Baker, and Angie MacDonald, and Ed Parker. Did they, too, have a "cry" deep inside? Was it that which made Jennie Call so sharp-tongued? Why, the chain was endless. From the corroding loneliness of the long years, from the depths dug by inadequacy and despair, from all the petty annoyances and hours of hunger, understanding came to Becky. In a movement such as this, all gave, and all received in one form or another; and because of the giving and the receiving, twenty thousand people were going to have their faith justified. They were going to have new homes, permanent homes "We are two of a kind, Ingeborg. With your wagon and my cow, we can make it into the Valley." "But your gold�?" "My�?" Slowly, slowly, Becky turned to the bed where lay the pouch of gold dust. She put out her hand, but drew it back sharply. She could not use it� the price of Take's life. "He sent it." Ingeborg was at her elbow. "He could not come, so he sent the gold. That is his share. You can buy a wagon, a team, warm clothes." She spoke in Danish, but Becky understood. "Yes. Yes! I can get a team, if you will drive. I can get a yoke of oxen for your wagon, and Martha and her husband can drive them. We can all be in the Valley next summer, Ingeborg, if you will take care of the horses and drive." Pioneer Stories and Incidents HANDCART PIONEERS President Amy Brown Lyman [This is the seventh in a series of true pioneer incidents to be published by Thein honor of the 1947 Utah Centennial celebration.�Ed.] AMONG the stories which tell A of the early settlement of Utah, and of the great heroism of the settlers themselves, perhaps the most dramatic, as well as the most pathetic, are those connected with the handcart pioneers� pioneers who were so-called because they crossed the plains with the aid of handcarts. In all, there were ten companies of these pioneers, made up of 3,000 individuals, who came to Utah between the years 1856 and 1861, the first company arriving in Salt Lake Valley in September 1856, and the last one in September 1860. They came mostly from Europe�from the British Isles and Scandinavia. These daring and courageous pioneers landed at New York, or Boston, and proceeded, by rail, to Iowa City which was the western terminus of the Rock Island Railroad, and the outfitting point for the handcart companies. From there, � they traveled across Iowa to the Missouri River, and on to Utah, following the old Mormon Trail. This unique method of travel was adopted because it was inexpensive, and because it seemed to be the best means of bringing in the largest number of those who were desirous of emigrating. The rate of only $45 to come from Liverpool to Salt Lake City made it possible for many, who had been anxiously waiting and praying for an opportunity to gather to Zion with the saints, to come, who otherwise would not have been able to do so. Page 178 At the same time, it brought the travelers to Utah in as little time as did ox teams. Almost anyone could walk as fast as a yoke of oxen could travel. The journey across the plains required from three to four months. These handcart companies were made up of men, women, and children, the majority of whom walked the entire distance of 1300 miles, pulling and pushing their carts, which were loaded with their baggage and rations. Only a few wagons accompanied each group to help with the heaviest baggage and provisions, and to provide for hospital service. These noble and courageous converts waded through rivers and streams, trudged through deep sand and mud, tramped over rough and rocky roadways, and climbed hills and mountains. Walking across the plains was not an entirely new undertaking at that time, however, as many of the covered-wagon pioneers before this had walked a good portion of the distance from the Missouri River, to relieve the tired, overworked teams; but pushing and pulling handcarts, in addition to merely walking, was real labor, which demanded both strength and courage. The handcart companies were setup for one company of 500. Individuals consisted of 120 carts, five twenty-five seasoned and substantial, and therefore, much repair work was require on the way- | every case, handcart travel was hard and strenuous. It was especially so for the aged, and for those from the larger cities, who had factories, and offices, and were thus poorly prepared for such an experience. It was also quite hazardous. These camps lacked the protection which the heavy covered wagons gave to other companies, and the people were more exposed to the elements, and to the Indians and wild animals, which were ever to be reckoned with. In one instance, the Indians ran with the beef cattle, tramp by a frightened herd of buffalo on a stampede. Nevertheless, in spite of hardships and difficulties, these travelers, like those who came in covered wagons, often drew their carts together of an evening, and around the campfire sang songs, made speeches, and told stories. In the main, handcart travel was quite successful. Eight of the companies which started out early in the summertime crossed successfully and arrived safely, often having fewer deaths than did the ox caravans; but there were two ill-fated companies� the Willie and Martin companies, which began the journey in mid and late July of 1856, too late in the season, and suffered severely before being rescued and helped into the Valley the following November. These companies had been delayed, in t he beginning, because the carts were not ready. Then, on the way, there had been additional de-lay because some of the carts did not hold up, making extensive repair work necessary. These delays brought about such a shortage of food that rationing had to be re-sorted to. Although each emigrant was allowed only seventeen pounds of luggage in the first place, it became necessary to lighten the loads, and clothing and bedding, so much needed later, had to be discarded. Added to all this, severe cold weather set in much earlier than usual. As a result, there was great suffering from both cold and hunger, and ap-proximately 15 0 deaths occurred before the rescue parties from Utah reached them. The faith, courage, endurance, and heroism demonstrated by the members of these unfortunate companies would be hard to equal, even on the battlefield, and it is most fit-ting that two monuments have been erected, in Wyoming, to their memory, by the Utah Pioneer Trails and Landmarks Association. One is at Rock Creek, where seventeen per-sons passed away in a single night, and lie buried in one grave; and the other is on the highway, across the Sweetwater from Martin's Hollow, about two miles west of Devil's Gate.
