Herbs and Their Uses Elizabeth Williamson With Illustrations by the Author "Rosemary, that's for remembrance."�Shakespeare have been used extensively. The Greeks, the Egyptians, and the Chinese found their properties valuable. The Bible mentions fragrant oils of myrrh and frankincense, cinnamon, anise, and mint. Our pioneer ancestors used herbs for medicine, dyes, lotions, and culinary purposes. If you have never grown herbs, you will find a fascinating new world open to you. Easy to grow, they require little care. They respond magnificently, if given good drainage and plenty of sunshine. Below is a chart of the most common herbs and some of their uses: Perennials Use Bergamot Flavoring, oils for perfume, tonic Camomile Beverage, dye, bouquets Chives Salad, cheese, omelets Balm Cool beverage Mint Vinegar, sauces, drinks Parsley Salads, garnish, soups, meats Sage Stuffings, cheese, beverage, flavoring for sausage and other meat Tarragon Vinegar Rosemary Meats, herb vinegar, fragrance Thyme Soups, stews, stuffing (poultry) Horseradish Roots � used in relish and for salad, as an ingredient of mustard Feverfew Cut flowers, bouquets Caraway Seeds (dried) sauerkraut, baking, green leaves for salads Annuals Use Savory Stuffings, beans, to relieve insect bites Dill Pickles, butter sauce for fish Borage Salad, iced beverages (use flowers and all) Marjoram Meats, salads, stuffings Cress Salad Mustard Salad and greens Red Pepper For table decorations, pickling, and flavoring Nasturtium Leaves and buds for salads, seed pods for pickling Basil tomato dishes, soups, meats Lavender Sachets, linens Lemon Sachets, also for Verbena iced drinks Rose Sachets, also used Geranium in jellies Page 187 Herbs make pretty borders along a path or roadway. Some of the sturdier perennials, such as sage, rosemary, winter and summer savory, can be kept trimmed back for small hedges. Parsley makes an attractive border herb. Many herbs grow well in rock gardens. Herbs are not difficult to grow�just give them good, light soil. Never use a fertilizer, because it destroys the oils in herbs. Plant herbs in a sheltered place, where they will get direct sunlight. They are ready to harvest when they begin to bloom. Tie them in small bunches and hang them upside down in a dry, airy place, away from the sun. If you are interested, primarily, in the culinary uses of herbs, it is more convenient to have your herbs planted near your kitchen door in a compact and orderly arrangement. An old ladder may be used as a frame for a charming small herb garden. For fragrance and flowering, use an old wagon wheel and plant a different herb between each pair of spokes. Our pioneer ancestors used this method. It is attractive and practical. The herbs are kept to themselves by the spoke divisions. Herbs may be made into a formal garden, a rock garden, or used around bird baths, or as hedges and borders. The possibilities are unlimited. When once you come under the magic spell of herbs, you will have many ideas of your own. Herbs make unusual and exciting gifts for Christmas or for birthdays. If you are invited to a wedding shower, give the bride a gift of herbs. It will be unusual and yet very useful and acceptable. Put the dried herbs in glass jars and label them attractively, or paste pictures of the herbs (obtained from seed catalogues) on the jars. The label might, also, suggest uses for the herbs or, perhaps, give two or three brief recipes. Another attractive way to make herb gifts is to sew little sacks of attractive print cloth and make a small patch of plain coloring on which to embroider the names of the herbs. The little sacks, filled with herbs, can then be placed in an attractive box, or hung on hooks on a little wooden rack or shelf. The rack, or shelf, may be gaily enameled or painted or covered with wallpaper. When preparing herbs for gifts, both individual herbs and various combinations may be used. HERBS AND THEIR USES Two common mixtures of dried herbs are listed below: -Parsley Chives Basil Marjoram -Parsley Several green onions Rosemary Basil A bay leaf Thyme If you wish to make sachets of sweet-smelling herbs, use scraps of rayon or lovely silk for making the bags, tie them with pastel ribbons, and decorate them with fancy bows or little rosettes in the form of flowers. A bottle of herb vinegar for salads makes an attractive and unusual gift. To make this, place a handful of basil, mint, tarragon, or a combination of these or other favorite herbs, in a pint jar. Pour undiluted vinegar over the herbs to the top of the jar and seal it tightly. Place the jar in direct sunlight for two weeks and shake it once a day. Then, strain the vinegar, bottle it again, and make a colorful and attractive label for the jar. You will find that herbs are a delight to grow, that they will add flavor to your cooking, and will enhance the interest and attractiveness of your gift giving.
