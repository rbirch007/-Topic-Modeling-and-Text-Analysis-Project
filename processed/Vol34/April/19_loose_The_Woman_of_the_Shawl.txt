The Woman of the Shawl C. Frank Steele MET her quite casually, the Woman of the Shawl. She must have been past seventy, and she was quite bent, but there was a radiance about her face that made it saintly. She reminded me of my own mother. 'The goodness of her heart shone through her kindly eyes. I can see her now, the Woman of the Shawl, going to church as faithfully as the good bishop himself. She never missed her Sunday School classes; she always said, "Living means learning." Always she went 'early. I remember meeting her one spring morning. The trees along the avenue were leafing out; the grass was showing green. The air was sweet and bracing. "Good morning! A perfect spring day?" It was the Woman of the Shawl. - She always wore a shawl, and she was smiling. There was a graciousness in her voice that warmed me. "It is�Mother," I said. The "Mother" slipped out quite unconsciously. But I could see it pleased her. "A rare morning, indeed. You go to church early." "Yes, always. I love the early morning air. Then I think that my going to Sunday School early might encourage others to do the same. I think one gets a little closer to God in the early morning. It's so quiet." And down the street, toward the little church on the corner, she walked. Page 268 And isn't this I met her again. It was in the summer, and although the day was new, the sun was warm. "Good morning!" she cried. "Isn't it grand to be alive?" "It is, Mother, but aren't you suffering from this terrific July heat we are having?" I asked. "Not at all. You see, I even have my shawl around me. Somehow, I cling to it the year round. We are such good friends. I feel lost without it. And then, how could one complain of anything when one has a bed of pansies like this?" And she pointed to a mass of lovely blooms at her feet. Her eyes fairly feasted on them. I had not noticed them before. It was autumn, and our pansy bed was a bit forlorn and faded and the trees were shedding their first yellow and gold leaves. There was a first hint of frost in the air; the call of the birds was wistful. It was on such: a morning that I again met the Woman of the Shawl, and, curiously enough, we met at our pansy bed. I had always called it "our pansy bed," after that 'summer meeting. Her greeting was that same happy "Good morning!" And she added, "How nippy the air is!" "Nippy it is, Mother. We're already well into autumn, and isn't it a shame our pansies must die? Life is cruel that way, Mother," I said. She looked at me. "No, my son, life is not cruel. Nothing is lost. Life is kind, if we are kind. Even THE WOMAN OF THE SHAWL in January, under the snow, everything seems dead. But there is life there. It is so comforting to know that, don't you think?" And I confessed that it was, as I left the brave little figure in the shawl. Came winter. The trees were bare, and a piercing wind was blowing out of the north. Under the deep snow lay our pansy bed. Would I meet her on a morning like this? Not likely, I thought, as I huddled deeper in my great coat and picked my way through the drifting snow. Suddenly, I spied her. Her head was down and she was picking her way through the snow. I noticed, too, that she was not alone this morning. Beside her trudged a small child, a girl. The child's hand was held firmly by the old woman, as, together, they faced the raw wind. I called, "Well, here we are meeting again! Good morning, Mother." "Tt is a bit stormy, but how white the snow is!" she answered. "I never 269 saw prettier snow.' Her voice was cheery. I looked closer. "But, Mother� the shawl, where is it?" She chuckled. "It's here." And she patted the head of the child. Sure enough, there it was, pinned about, the head of the round-faced girl by her side. "But, Mother, you are taking such risks. You should not have done this," I cried anxiously. She was ready with her answer, as she always was. "You see, my boy, Betty's mother is in the hospital. She�she has no father. She needed the shawl more than I did." We, the three of us, walked on together, silently. There were few abroad. I helped the old lady and the child along as best I could. It seemed to be growing colder. I looked down at the child and ventured, "My, Betty, this is a cold day, isn't it, dear?" She looked up at me out of the shawl and said, "It was, Sir, before Granny Mahoney came along." RECOMPENSE Berta H.
