PRISONER
Margery S. Stewart
She never watched the spring come in, She never saw it go, Nor listened to a robin sing In cherry flowers and snow.
She owned a world of walls and roof And shades to bar the light, And dainty, needful things to do Betwixt the dawn and night.
But once the moonlight drew her out In shift and tumbled braid, She saw the artistry of God On field and valley laid.
His awesome splendor and his might In cloud-torn sky and hill, The endlessness of world on world, Spring stirring, new and still.
She looked and shrank and fled within, And, trembling, turned the key; Her eyes sought all familiar things, As small, as safe as she. Pioneer Stories and Incidents Pioneer Stories and Incidents
HANDCART PIONEERS�II

[This is the eighth in a series of true pioneer incidents to be published by Thein honor of the 1947 Utah Centennial celebration.�Ed.]
PATIENCE Leader Rozsa Archer, a long-time and greatly beloved resident of Pleasant Grove, was well known among her fellow townspeople as one of the heroic handcart pioneers. Converts to Mormonism, and faithful Latter-day Saints in England, the Leader family had long been planning to emigrate to Utah and, on December 10, 1865, they sailed from their native land with a large company of English and Scandinavian Saints. They had a stormy voyage of eleven weeks. Their supply of fresh water became short, which necessitated their cooking with salt water and, due to the lengthy voyage, their food supply became limited. There was a great deal of sickness on board, and sixty-two deaths occurred en route.
Landing in New York the last of February, the family remained there until early summer, when they left for Iowa City, on the frontier, to make final preparations for the trip to Utah. Here they joined by Patience's sister Zilpah and her husband John Jaques, who had recently arrived from England. Young James was a man of great faith, ability, and good works. He had been a successful local missionary in England, was a scholar and a writer, and he is author of "O Say, What Is Truth?" and other inspiring hymns.
He later became assistant Church historian.
The Loader-Jaques families joined the Martin Handcart Company, which left Iowa City, July 28 and Florence, Nebraska, August 25, dangerously late in the season, and about two weeks later than the Willie Company. They had not gone very far before the carts began to give way. Even while crossing Iowa, the mechanics were kept busy evenings with repair work. The troubles increased as the travelers went on through Nebraska and came in contact with the rougher roads. Extensive repair work now became necessary, causing almost continuous delays, which brought about such an unexpected shortage of food that rationing became necessary. By the middle of September, as they approached the mountains, severe storms overtook them, and as the weather got colder and the provisions grew shorter, many perished and probably all would have perished had it not been that rescuers from Salt Lake City reached them and helped them into the Valley.

When flour was cut to four ounces per person per day, most of the people made gruel out of their flour, but Patience and her mother made theirs into little biscuits for use when the members of the family became exhausted they could eat one. The story is told of how one day when Sister Leader was walking along, she came to a man lying by the roadside. She spoke to him and asked him if he could not get up. He answered, "I could if only I had a mouthful of bread." She gave him a biscuit, which he ate, and then he got up and started on. Many months later, Sister Leader met this man on the streets of Salt Lake City and he told her she had saved his life.
AT Cutler's Park, just a few miles west of Florence, Nebraska, Almon Babbtt, Secretary of Utah Territory, whose train loaded with government property was traveling ahead, called by and offered to take someone with him on his horse to catch the camp ahead. A Mrs. Williams accepted the invitation as she was walking and carrying her baby, and was anxious to reach her destination as soon as possible. Her husband was already in Salt Lake waiting for her.
"At the next stop," records Patience, "they (the Martin Company) found newly-made graves and a green sunbonnet which they knew belonged to Mrs. Williams. The company which Mrs. Williams and Mr. Babbtt had caught up with had been overtaken by the Indians. Mrs. Williams was taken prisoner and never heard of again, and no one knew what became of her baby. Mr. Babbtt was killed, and all the others, excepting one teamster who escaped and who told the sad story. Patience brought the bonnet to Utah and presented it to the husband, Mr. Williams.
At one point of the journey, five
large, aggressive-looking Indians suddenly came out of a cave near the road and stopped the company, wanting everything they could see. But when they discovered so many were sick, they became frightened and left. On another day, Patience found a beef head lying near the road and brought it to camp where it was boiled up for soup.
There was always kindness and co-operation among these emigrants. The Loaders had two carts, and at one time for several days in succession they made room in one cart for a sick woman and two babies, and in the other they placed extras, besides their own bedding and provisions. When, tired and discouraged, they were about ready to give up, William Cluff came to their rescue. He tied a rope to his saddle and then to the cart, and helped them along for several hours over the roughest road.
The Leader-Jaques families, with all the rest of the company, suffered not only fatigue and exhaustion, hunger and cold, but also sickness and death. Two members of their family group passed away en route�the father, Brother Leader, and the little daughter of Brother and Sister Jaques. A son had been born to Mrs. Jaques near Florence at the beginning of the journey, and at Green River on the 23d of November, near the end of the journey, their little daughter passed on.
Brother Leader died on September 14th. He had helped to pull the carts as long as he could, but got weaker every day. Finally he had to give up, and was only able to pick up wood. On September the 23d, after walking seventeen miles, he gave out, and lay down on a quilt. They tried to soothe him with hot flour gruel. The next morning the captain of the company offered to put him on a provision wagon, but his family said, "No, he is dying, and we want him on our own cart." At 1 P. M. they pitched their tent over the cart, and at 11:15 that night, he died. The next morning Samuel and Albert Jones (later of Provo) dug a grave and laid him away.
The company arrived in the Valley November 30th, just eleven months and twenty-two days after the Loaders had left Liverpool. When Patience, the city-bred maiden, looked over the Valley, she said,
"If this is the city, what must the country be like? I will not live here." She soon, however, recovered her courage and faith, and began to plan how she could be of most help to her family in establishing a home.
Patience, always a zealous missionary, converted John Rozsa, a sergeant in Johnston's army, whom she married. She accompanied him to Washington, D. C., at the time of the Civil War, and when he was mustered out, they began the journey back to Utah. On the way the husband died and, with her little children, Patience completed the journey. Later, she married John B. Archer.
