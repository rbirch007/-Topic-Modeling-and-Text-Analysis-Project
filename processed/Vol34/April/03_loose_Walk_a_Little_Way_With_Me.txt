WALK A LITTLE WAY WITH ME
Leona Bammies Gardner
Come, Friend, and walk a little way with me, For well I know the heavy load you bear; Here, take my willing hand. Talk if you wish� Let me a little of your burden share.
Come, Friend, and walk a little way with me; The birds still sing; God hears and answers prayer. Come, let the healing sunshine fill your soul And wipe away your sorrow and despair.
Tomorrow, I must lift my load again And face the day with fortitude and grace. Today, I laid my own small griefs aside To bask with you of peace and a smiling face.
