Latter-Day Saint Pioneers in New Mexico Estelle Webb Thomas HE high plateau country of New Mexico is divided almost in half by the Rio Grande River, which rises in the Colorado mountains to the north and flows southward to El Paso, Texas, from which place it outlines, for many miles, the border between Texas and Old Mexico. Before the white men came, many tribes of Indians claimed the blue hills, the high mountains, and the cactus-clad deserts of New Mexico. These were the wild and nomadic Navajos, Apaches, and Comanches, and the more civilized Pueblo people who lived along the valley of the Rio Grande in agricultural communities. White men explored the wilderness of New Mexico long before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock, before Jamestown, Virginia, was settled, and very soon after the discovery of Florida by the Spaniards. Thus, the trails of white men in New Mexico are very old, and the story of early exploration in this region is linked with the conquistadors and their search for the Seven Cities of Cibola, which were supposed to contain great wealth and treasure. Between 1528 and 1536, Cabeza de Vaca visited many of the Pueblo villages. He was followed by other explorers and, by 1598, a colony of 400 white men and their families was established at San Juan under the leadership of Juan de Onate. In 1605, the settlement of Santa Fe was begun. The advent of the Latter-day Saints into New Mexico began with the perilous trek of the Mormon Battalion. In 1846, after the saints had left Nauvoo and while they were traveling through Iowa, they were called upon to furnish 500 men to take part in the war against Mexico. With much difficulty and many hardships, the Mormon Battalion was marshalled and, during September and October, the men, in several detachments, arrived in Santa Fe. From that place they traveled down the Rio Grande almost to El Paso, Texas, and then turned westward toward the Gila River and the deserts of Arizona. Thus, the brave Battalion men crossed through a large part of New Mexico. They suffered greatly from fatigue, hunger, thirst, and from diseases of various kinds. Many of the men died en route and so were never reunited with their families in the valleys of the mountains. Ten years after the pioneers arrived in Salt Lake Valley, Jacob Hamblin, the famous scout and frontiersman, crossed the Colorado River and began his work as a missionary-explorer of the canyon country. His contacts with the Indians eventually led him, as well as other missionaries, into the New Mexico hills northwest of the section traversed earlier by the Mormon Bat-talion. The usual pattern of history in the Southwest was followed in the case of the Latter-day Saint settlement. First, came the missionaries, then, the settlers. The first to build homes were Lorenzo Hatch and John Maughn, who settled in the Zuni pueblo country in 1876. Luther Burnham, who had been a missionary among the Indians for two years, brought his family, in 1877, to Savoia (later Ramah), which was named for the Spanish word "cebolla," meaning onion. This frontier settlement, almost straight west of Albuquerque and near the Arizona- New Mexico boundary, was sur-rounded by weird mesa mountains and a great expanse of desert. After two years here, since the uncertain temper of the Indians made life hazardous for a young family, Elder Burnham was advised by the Church authorities to move to St. Johns, Arizona, where the Latter-day Saints were building a settlement. Two years later he was again sent to New Mexico. This time he settled on the San Juan River, near the Utah border, where many of his descendants still live. During the period of early settlement, the San Juan Stake extended from Moab, on Grand River, Utah, to Hammond (now Bloomfield), New Mexico, on the San Juan River. Visiting Church authorities from Salt Lake City had to travel about six hundred miles by wagon or buggy, over the roughest and most primitive roads, to cover this stake. In May 1912 it was divided and the eastern part, lying in New Mexico, has since been called the Young Stake. Had a Church social last night; took in thirty dollars, guaranteeing us another month of school. Contrast this entry from an old Church record, and the picture it presents, with the beautiful, modern chapel, up-to-date consolidated school, fine residences, farms, and orchards of the Kirtland Ward to-day, and the story of the Latter-day Saints in New Mexico during the past half century is dramatically told. WHEN the Bumhams arrived on the San Juan there were only four or five white families in this region, although farther up the river the little town of Farmington was already well established. The treaty of 1868 had been long enough in force so that the Indians, as a whole, were friendly and peace-able, and the attitude of the Latter-day Saints fostered this spirit. True to Brigham Young's admonition to feed rather than to fight the Indians, the saints were quick with neighborly overtures and, though there were a few unhappy incidents and soldiers were called from Fort Wingate to restore order, it was not long before the Navajos regarded the saints as friends and benefactors. A number of the pioneers set up trading posts and the Indians soon came in large groups to trade and barter their rugs, wool, and mutton. Sister Betsy Burnham, wife of George Burnham, a brother of the bishop, wrote to relatives that night-fall often found the house full of Indians�men, women, and children. They were always fed and beds spread down in the yard or, if it chanced to be winter, before the fireplace. Often the floor was so covered with sleeping Navajos that it was difficult to pass through the room. The same condition obtained wherever the saints were to be found. Leslie Clawson, of Ramah, writes: It was no uncommon thing to see twenty or thirty Navajos at our house on friendly visits for a day or so at a time. My mother fed and helped them with beds, etc. Although times were hard in this new country, the Mormons always felt it was up to them to help the Indians if necessary. There were few Mexicans on the San Juan at this time, since the Mexicans and Indians had long been traditional enemies. There was one fellow, however, Costiano, who had maintained his standing by bullying and bombast. One night, crazed with drink, he attempted and almost succeeded in breaking up a dance in Fruitland, but Claibourne Brimhall, a fearless young fellow, braved the brandishing gun and forcibly eject-ed the big Mexican from the building. Next day, Costiano, sober and embarrassed, made abject apologies for his misbehavior. The settlers lost no time in set-ting out orchards and laying out farms. Harnessing the waters of the San Juan was a hard and expensive task, but the settlers were rich in the essentials of pioneering� health, energy and enthusiasm and, most important of all, faith. Soon they were harvesting hay, wheat, and corn, as well as vegetables. Though some articles were hard to get, there were no starvation periods as in some new communities. Before long fruit was so plentiful, apples especially, that they were seeking a market. Ray Young, now laboring in the Navajo-Zuni Mission, remembers ac-companying his father, John R. Young, on an apple-selling journey to Gallup and Luna Valley, New Mexico, and St. Johns, Arizona. They left Fruitland in November and re-turned late in January, traveling, of course, by team and wagon. Quite a contrast in transportation to the great truck loads of fruit which now roll out from this region daily during the autumn season, bound for distant markets.Page 225 226 RANGE IN NORTHERN Courtesy, Martin R.

LATTER-DAY SAINT PIONEERS IN NEW MEXICO 227 app) LATTER-DAY SAINT PIONEERS IN NEW MEXICO ALTHOUGH wheat and corn began to be raised immediately, having the grain converted into breadstuff was more of a problem. Old settlers remember the wearisome chore, which usually fell to the lot of the younger boys, of grinding wheat and corn on the creaking old coffee mills of that period. Considering the large families and the hearty appetites of those hard working people, this was no small job. In 1895, however, William G. Black erected a gristmill which served the people of the valley for several years before it was washed away in a flood. Members of the Black family still: operate a gristmill on the San Juan. This community acquired its first post office under the name of Oleo. It was located in the old Thomas Stolworthy place, then owned by a man named Moss, who was the first postmaster. Later, Oleo was divided and the western section called Fruitland; then the bishop bought the land of Oleo, cut it up Courtesy, Martin R. Young, Sr. 229 into lots available for purchase by _ the heads of families, and called the ward Kirtland. This was during the administration of Bishop Ashcroft, second bishop in this locality, who was later killed while making an irrigation ditch. Other early bishops who did much for the country religiously, financially, and even politically, were Elmer Taylor and Claibourne Brimhall, still staunch and influential men in the community. Ira Hatch, famous missionary to the Indians, made his home here for many years. During the never-ending struggle to become established in this new country, the settlers somewhat neglected their little cemetery. 'Toward the end of Brother Hatch's life, this circumstance worried the old missionary. Although tombstones were at that time out of the question, he dreaded lying in an unmarked grave; so on his death, at his request, a large flat stone which had been used for a bridge across the irrigation ditch before his gate, was placed at the head of his grave, and it still stands, a unique marker for this unique pioneer. As in all new communities, the woman's side of the venture was, per-haps, harder than that of the man. There is a challenge in subduing the wilderness that satisfies a man's urge for adventure, while Lot's wife is symbolic of a woman's tendencv to look regretfully back. The known and well-beloved give her a sense of security, and household comforts mean much to her. But in New Mexico the woman followed her husband cheerfully and loyally, and it was her hand that converted the one or two-roomed house from the status of a camp into that of a home. Among the first buildings to be erected, both at Ramah, to the south in Valencia County, and Fruitland, was the church, or rather com-munity house, used for Church serv-ices, school, and all social affairs. At Fruitland this was a one-room building about twenty by thirty-six feet in size, soon enlarged into a T, and the original adobes plastered over and called ''the white schoolhouse." It was used for many years. Meetings and gatherings were ap-pointed, poetically, for "early candlelight," rather than at some set hour, perhaps because of a scarcity of clocks and watches. But, in spite of all drawbacks, or because of them, the pioneers made merry on every possible occasion, putting the same wholehearted vim into their innocent amusements that they did into their work. Young and old took part in all social affairs, and the resulting good-fellowship is remembered nostalgically by all who still survive. MUSIC at the dances was always good, for young Will Evans and Clint Burnham each had a gift for the fiddle, and there was always some sister who could accompany on the organ. These dances and parties filled the need for relaxation in win-ter, but summer was really the time for gaiety and, though the farmers worked from dawn till dark, there was always time and strength for fruit and melon "busts," picnics, and parades. Immediately after the organization of the ward came the organization of the Relief Society. Although the a humble beginning of what this great organization has grown to be, OF JOHN R. AND TAMAR YOUNG IN FRUITLAND, NEW MEXICO 230 Courtesy, Sadie Dustin ABAGAIL STEVENS FIRST PRESIDENT, KIRTLAND WARD RELIEF SOCIETY, AND TWO OF HER DAUGHTERS "Society meetings" were the highland of the busy housewife�s week, and stood in lieu of all the clubs, parties, and receptions which fill her granddaughter's leisure time. Each meeting helped to strengthen the ties that bound the sisters to a common cause. The first president of the Kirtland Ward Relief Society, Sister Abagail Stevens, seems to have been a remarkable woman. She was also that most indispensable of women, the community nurse and midwife. Not one of the "old timers" but has a kind word for Sister Stevens! Not one whose face fails to light up at mention of this sister, who, next to faith in God, as one aged man remarked, was most important. There should be some fitting monument to these saintly women, who gave so freely of their time, strength, and courage; who, lacking in medical knowledge, were so closely in touch with divine power that their hands were guided and they performed miracles of healing. Though obstetrics was an important part, it was by no means the midwife's only duty. Epidemics, broken bones, pneumonia, every misadventure that could and did befall the pioneers, demanded the presence of the local nurse. Maternity work was evidently considered most important, however, since the nurse was paid for that� sometimes! The magnificent sum of three dollars for each delivery, usually paid in work at one dollar fifty cents per day, or in produce, or perhaps by a load of wood. Unlike the Mexicans who knock off a dollar if the child is a girl, the pioneers paid full price regardless of sex! But, if the midwife's earthly remuneration was practically nil, she was
