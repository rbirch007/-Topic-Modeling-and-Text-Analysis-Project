Real Bargains
Ivie H. Jones
President, Spanish-American Mission Relief Society
A bargain is not a bargain unless it is the proper size or is usable. I carry in my purse, at all times, a small flat notebook in which is written the sizes of some of my windows, length and width for tablecloths, amount of material needed for dickeys, blouses, etc., and numerous other measurements, so that when I see a bargain I will know the correct sizes and amounts to buy.
On another page in my little memo book I record the sizes for hats, shoes, hose, underwear, coveralls, and shirts for the children, inlaws, and grandchildren. Whenever I get a chance, without them catching me, I also measure the width of their clothes across the shoulders, the length of their sleeves, length of their hose from heel to toe, length of the little girl's skirt, boy's trousers, or any other measurements that would be helpful in determining their size should I run across a bargain or something especially attractive. About twice a year I try to bring this list up to date, making a note of the changes in size.
In the bottom of my purse I keep a tiny, flat, metal tape measure. It is only a foot long when opened up and folds up to four inches in length, so it really takes up very little space in my purse Sometimes garments at sales are not correctly marked for size. If there is a question, out comes my metal tape.
It is always thrilling to receive a letter saying: "The things you sent the children for Christmas fit perfectly, how did you ever guess the size?"
It is easy to guess when one has correct measurements, and when I see a bargain I can buy unafraid, for I know how much to buy and what size!

Petersen, President of the Danish Mission, reports a Christmas party sponsored by the mission board and the Relief Society of Copenhagen in December 1946: "The spirit there was wonderful. The hall was beautifully decorated in Christmas colors; refreshments were served, Christmas carols were sung, and a nice program was given. But the thing that, more than anything else, will make us remember particularly this party was the Christmas pageant sent out by the mission board and written and directed by Sister Johanne Ostrup. While we were all sitting at the tables the three Wise Men came into the hall, perfectly costumed in raiment designed by Sister Louise Sorensen. Slowly the Wise Men walked down the hall to the stage where the blue velvet curtain was covered with hundreds of little stars, with one big, shining one hanging at the top. The curtain was then drawn aside, and we could see the virgin Mary with the Christ Child on her lap and Joseph standing behind her. The Singing Mothers then began the lovely song 'A Child was Born at Bethlehem.' The Wise Men walked up to the child, knelt down, and brought him their offerings. There were tears in many eyes, and everyone felt that he had been on sacred ground. The Relief Society sisters have once more made many people happy. May God bless them in their great work."

Theology  The Life and Ministry of the Savior GY y Lesson 5 "The Boy of Nazareth" "In the Wilderness of Judea" Elder Don B, Colton (Reference: Jesus the Christ, Chapters 9 and 10, by Elder James E. Talmage) For Tuesday, February 3, 1948 Objective: To show that Jesus early understood his divine calling and spent a period of careful Preparation for his great ministry, JOSEPH and Mary, upon their return from Egypt, established their home in the small town of Nazareth They fain would have ancestors, but Joseph, "being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee� (Matt 2:22). It had been said by prophet of old that "He shall be called a Nazarene,"' Here, the boy Jesus grew to manhood. Because so little is known of his boyhood, the sacred word is, no doubt, wisely silent on the events of his early years. His infancy and boyhood were natural and actual. Though a God before his birth, the veil of forgetfulness common to al] who are born to earth "shut off the vision of his Primeval existence." He came to earth to have, and did have, the experiences of mortality,   are justified in saying that he was taught well in the Jewish law Old Testament scriptures, "And the child stew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him" Page 778 (Luke 2:40). Later in life this was fully shown, though he offended the Jews by not quoting more frequently from the scriptures, Both Joseph and Marty seem to have been strict observers of the law of Moses. Its Provisions required the men, and allowed the women, to observe the Feast of the Passover annually, (The establishment of this sacred ceremonial should be reviewed. Deut. 16:1-6 and Ex, 12) The twelfth year was extremely important to every Jewish boy. During that year he became "a son of the law." He was recognized as a member of his home When Jesus was twelve years old, his This journey has Particular significance because it is the first appearance of Jesus banks of the Jordan to be baptized of John, (President J. Reuben Clark, Jr.) LESSON DEPARTMENT President Clark has written an excellent treatise entitled "Wist Ye Not That I Must Be About My Father's _ Business?" It appeared first in The issue and the first five issues of 1944), and may now be purchased from the General Board of Relief Society. Anyone who reads this will be greatly enlightened. During these annual gatherings Jerusalem was a city of between two 'and three millions of people. "Innumerable multitudes" came from all the provinces of the Holy Land. Usually, the feast, or celebration, lasted several days. On the memorable event of the first visit of Jesus, and after the feast, Joseph and Mary had gone a "day's journey" toward home when they discovered the boy was not with the company. There can be but little doubt that he had planned to stay behind and do the work in the temple necessary to fit him for his future tasks. He felt the urge of his great work. When his parents, after three days of searching, found him conversing in the temple with the learned priests and scribes, he must have known his mission. In answer to their anxious inquiry, he said to his mother: "How is it that ye sought me? Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?" (Luke 2:49). With our knowledge of the preexistence, we are sure he had begun, at that early age, to understand the full: import of his calling. It is stated: "And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them." He knew whereof he spoke, but even | his mother seems never to have fully understood. All that we have recorded in the scriptures concerning the events of 779 the eighteen years following the visit of Jesus to the temple is found in one meaningful sentence: "And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man" (Luke 2:52).. In the Wilderness of Judea Attention was called in a previous lesson to the birth of one of the great characters of the Messianic period. The son of Zacharias, known as John the Baptist, commenced his preaching in the wilderness. He had evidently spent much time preparing for his great work. His teachers were divinely appointed, and he had communed with God apart from the busy "marts of trade." John lived the simple life. He wore a "raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle Perry Picture MADONNA AND CHILD From a painting by Janssen 780 about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey." His message was one calling for repentance and a clean life. Ceremonials and outward forms of Jewish origin would be no longer the only criterion for religious life. He called upon the people everywhere to repent "for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." One mightier than he was soon to appear. John's mission was one to prepare the people for the coming of their Lord. He baptized with water, but one should come who would baptize with "the Holy Ghost and with fire." It was a new message. He scathingly rebuked hypocrisy and called for a humble life, devoted to serving God and keeping his commandments in the truest sense. Of the term. The people were in the fold of Abraham when they lived the gospel as taught by Abraham. Many people were convinced by his burning words and asked: "What shall we do then?" 'Though revolutionary, the answer was plain and clear-cut: "He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise" (Luke 3:11). It was a call for love, for service to fellow men, for helpfulness and good will toward those in distress. His call to repentance was not limited to one class or creed. It was to all men everywhere. Mark, a youthful convert, said it was "The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God" (Mark 1:1). John not only preached "the kingdom of heaven is at hand," but that the King was there. Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about Jordan, and were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins (Matt. 3:5-6). Then came one lesson for all men everywhere to remember. The Creator of the world the Lord Omnipotent came from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. It is doubtful that John's recognition was full and complete at first, but he did recognize the sinlessness and greatness of the character before him. Knowing that baptism was for the remission of sins, "John forbade him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?" The Mighty One replied: "Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness" (Matt. 3:1415). Jesus humbly complied with the same law that is required of the lowliest of the candidates for the celestial kingdom: And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased (Matt. 3:16-17). In addition to the form and necessity of baptism, the incident also teaches unmistakably the distinct individuality and personage of the three members of the Godhead. Note our first article of faith with reference to the account in the New Testament of the baptism of Jesus. The lesson should be very carefully studied. It is vital. Following the baptism of the Savior, occurred one of the most remarkable episodes in history. The Lord decided to go into solitary LESSON DEPARTMENT seclusion while he worked upon, may we say, "mapped out," his future Course of action. He must not be disturbed while he studied, fasted, and prayed. It must not be assumed that the chief Purpose of the experience in the wilderness was to be tempted and to show that the Lord could withstand temptation. It was a period of communion with God and his angels, a period to prepare he must have known something of his particular mission and status, His Father acknowledged him; the Holy Ghost had come to him, and had surely borne witness to his glorious divinity. For forty days and nights he fasted, prayed, and studied. His Physical being was brought into perfect subjection to his spirit. At the end of that strenuous period, he was hungry. Who wouldn't be? The proud and crafty archenemy of all righteousness, knew the power of hunger and what men will do to Satisfy its cravings. Here was another chance to thwart the designs of the Father. N Here was Satan' double Opportunity. Satan: "If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread," Jesus, under the detection of his Father, had made the 781 world. Surely, the Father would not be offended at the exercise of creative powers again. He knew now that he was the "beloved Son" of the Father, Why not satisfy his intense hunger and demonstrate to his fallen brother the power which the Creator possessed? Note the reply: "It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God" (Matt. 4:4). Satan was apt at quoting scripture, a Practice often resorted to by those who are working his terrible will. The humble Nazarene came back with a ready quotation from the scriptures, which he knew so well, and which he could apply so well. Jesus had met triumphantly the first satanic onslaught. The temptation had failed. Lucifer changed his tactics. He would try once more the appeal to Power and vanity. Jesus was Standing on the high pinnacle of the temple. Satan first reminded Jesus, "If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself " Again, he appealed to the scripture to prove that God would be mindful of his Son. And, again, the Lord met the challenge gloriously by quoting scripture: "It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God." Of course, to have yielded, our Lord could have exploited a great feat and been advertised far and wide. That, however, is not his way of doing things, as we shall show by subsequent events. Jesus had been victorious and retained his own innate greatness. God alone determines the time and place when miracles will be performed. Satan Probably reserved his greatest temptation for his last great effort. The appeal to vanity and pow- er is intriguing. From the top of a high mountain, Satan promised Jesus wealth, power, and glory if, in return, the Master would worship the tempter. Whether Lucifer had power to make good on his promise is beside the question. The glittering temptation was held out. Certainly, between the two of them, it could have been accomplished. The strength of Immanuel is clearly shown in his reply: Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve (Matt. 4:10). No wonder that, after the devil left, angels came and ministered to Christ the Lord. Questions and Suggestions for Discussion 1. Relate the circumstances leading to the visit to the temple when Jesus was twelve years old. What convincing statement did he make which shows that he clearly understood something of his divine calling? 2. What was the outstanding message of John the Baptist? 'Tell briefly the incidents of his ministry. 3. Describe the baptism of Jesus. How does it prove that there is more than one member of the Godhead? 4. Discuss the experiences of the Lord in the wilderness and the preparation for his ministry.:  Visiting Teacher Messages Our Pioneer Heritage Lesson 5 Cultural Activities President Amy Brown Lyman For Tuesday, February 3, 1948 Objective: To stimulate a deeper appreciation of the different cultural activities of the pioneers in order to better evaluate in a more understanding way similar activities today. HE foundation for cultural activities among Latter-day Saints was laid in pioneer times. Education, with drama, music, and other fine arts, all received attention and were fostered according to the resources of each community and each period. In Kirtland and in Nauvoo, schools of learning were established; and in temporary settlements on the plains, schools were held in private homes. In Nauvoo there were music and art classes, lecture courses, a debating society, and a home dramatic club. For the encouragement of the drama, a combined theater and dance hall was provided. 'The Latter-day Saints believed in a high type of recreation, and encouraged their children to sing, and to read and recite good literature. In Utah, elementary schools were established at once, and, soon afterward, these were followed by Church schools, high schools, and universities. In the beginning books were scarce, but, in 1852, a library of 2,000 volumes was hauled across the plains  LESSON DEPARTMENT by ox team, and in the autumn of the same year, Wilford Woodruff arrived with two tons of books. The drama flourished in Utah, even in the first and second decades. In the Social Hall ("Little Theater") and in the Salt Lake Theater, called by Henry Miller "a cathedral in the wilderness," first-class drama, including Shakespeare's plays, was presented by the home dramatic company, assisted later by nationally known artists. The great Tabernacle organ, the Tabernacle Choir, and the orchestra all did their part in producing cultural atmosphere in Utah. The Tabernacle itself, famed for its acoustic properties, was one of the great community assets, attracting many noted singers and musicians, all of whom left their impressions on the public. Adelina Patti is quoted as saying: Never have I encountered such perfect resonance as here in the Tabernacle. Why, my voice is twice as large here. It carried farther and with ever so much more tone than in any other hall I have ever sung in. Salt Lake City was the natural center of cultural activities, and the patterns set there were soon followed throughout other Church communities 783 In every local community there was a day school, and in many of them a night school for adults. There was a choir for Church services, a singing school, some stringed music for concerts and dances, a brass band, and a dramatic club. Pageants were early introduced to portray religious and historical themes. The auxiliary organizations, avenues for individual self-expression, encouraged literary and religious study, thus developing much talent. Many people have marvelled that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, small as it is, with less than a million members, and young as it is, just 118 years old, has been able to produce so many specialists in cultural fields; such as education, science, music, drama, art painting and sculpturing public speaking, and writing. The answer is that these are the fruits of the high ideals, standards, practices, and virtues set up by the Church, and of the opportunities and environment it provides. Suggestions for Discussion The class leader might mention a few of the Latter-day Saint educators, musicians, actors, artists, orators, and writers, and discuss, briefly, some of their accomplishments. SILVER DEATH Melba S. Payne The night had cast a silent spell Upon the scene below my window Where the flowers sleep. There was no way for me to tell That night would bring a withering breath Of hoary frost upon the vines. How could I know that with the dawn I'd find this silver death?  WELL-fitted sleeves and shoulder pads have a great deal to do with the good appearance and comfort of clothing. Too often mistakes in the fit of sleeves are made through a misunderstanding of the pattern. First of all, the sewer must realize that for proper freedom and ease the armhole of the sleeve itself must be larger than the armhole of the dress or jacket. Beginners are prone to think that the average sleeve is too long around the armhole and attempt to make adjustments by altering its shape or size.
We must caution you first against making any change in the sleeve as cut from the pattern unless it is done for proper fit and the armhole of the blouse has been altered to correspond.
Sleeves with puffs, gathered fullness, or darts over the shoulder do not often give much trouble. But plain sleeve that is meant to fit into the armhole of a blouse or jacket, with the finished seam fitted and smooth, does frequently cause difficulty. The extra fullness must be worked out carefully so that when complete it does not show as fullness but merely gives the room needed for the upper arm and shoulder.
When the garment is completed, the grain of the material in the sleeve should fall in a straight line down the shoulder seam. Therefore it becomes necessary to be careful to match the top of the sleeve as marked on the pattern to the shoulder seam. Do not shift the sleeve at all, either forward or backward.
With the top of the sleeve pinned properly in place and the underarm seams pinned together, work out the extra fullness that always appears in a sleeve by manipulating with the forefingers and thumbs. Stretch the armhole as much as possible and ease the sleeve into it, pinning at frequent intervals and being careful not to allow any little pleats to appear. When properly pinned in place, baste carefully with a small stitch, and finally machine stitch. If the sleeve is not put in straight as directed, it will have a tendency to pull and be uncomfortable.
Shoulder pads should be used to enhance the appearance of the garment and flatter the wearer. They should, therefore, be made to suit the individual and fit the garment. A woman with naturally broad shoulders will need less padding to adhere to the prevailing fashion than one with sloping or narrow shoulders. Each person will need to experiment with different types of pads to find out what she can best wear. LESSON DEPARTMENT
Some shoulder pads fit better placed in the armhole more to the front. Others need to be shifted to the back, but all pads fit better if they do not extend too far beyond the shoulder. A good rule to follow for this is to have the edge of the pad extend out just far enough to make a straight line with the arm 785 as it hangs down. Use a ruler against the arm to line it up. Shoulder pads should not look like lumps under a dress, but should be so tailored and fitted that they do not seem to be there but merely hold the garment to a flattering line. Literature Literature of the Doctrine and Covenants Lesson 5 Prayers of the Doctrine and Covenants Elder H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, February 17, 1948 Objective: To appreciate the Doctrine and Covenants as literature through a discussion of the prayers it contains, which are not unlike the lyric or song. THE prayer, as such, is not classed with any distinct literary form of writing. It is defined as a supplication or petition which is thought of, generally, in connection with sacred matters. If compared directly to a literary form one would think of a prayer as having several qualities not unlike the poem. There is first of all a meditation of a single individual in the voicing of a prayer whether it be for personal reasons. Or for one acting on behalf of a group. Again, there is the element of praise which lends itself to the quality of song in speech. Third, there often is the figurative language of the lyric to enhance the beauty of the petition. Then, there is the compact phrase in the wording of a prayer that presupposes a listener's knowledge of the facts behind a supplication. Soon after the completion of the Kirtland Temple, the Lord gave to Joseph Smith through revelation the prayer which later he used in the dedication of the building. Certain it must have been that during those hard and trying days of the saints in the then frontier country, Joseph Smith stored up in his mind and heart the struggles and heartaches of his people. The experiences, welled up over the years, gushed forth in words of supplication and praise in the day of accomplishment. To build a house to the Lord through sacrifice and tribulation expands the soul. The Prophet and his people desired a voice of gladness to echo their pent-up thoughts, and the Lord responded in a way which, today, we know as the 109 section of the Doctrine and Covenants. We will consider this prayer at length in the discussion period. Two other beautiful prayers in the Doctrine and Covenants may be found in section 65, and section 121:1-6. The first of these is listed as a revelation and is designated as a prayer committing the keys of the kingdom of God unto man. Note the parallelism that runs throughout: Hearken, and lo, a voice as of one sent down from on high, who is mighty and powerful, whose going forth is unto the ends of the earth, yea, whose voice is unto men Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. The keys of the kingdom of God are committed unto man on the earth, and from thence shall the gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth, as the stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands shall roll forth, until it has filled the whole earth. Yea, a voice crying Prepare ye the way of the Lord, prepare ye the supper of the Lamb, make ready for the Bridegroom. Pray unto the Lord, call upon his holy name, make known his wonderful works among the people. Call upon the Lord, that his kingdom may go forth upon the earth, that the inhabitants thereof may receive it, and be prepared for the days to come, in the which the Son of Man shall come down in heaven, clothed in the brightness of his glory, to meet the kingdom of God which is set up on the earth; Wherefore, may the kingdom of God go forth, that the kingdom of heaven may come, that thou, O God, mayest be glorified in heaven so on earth, that thine enemies may be subdued; for thine is the honor, power and glory, forever and ever. Amen (65). In the prayer of supplication found in verses one to six of section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants there is much of the creative power sensed in the lines not unlike that found in lyric poetry born of suffering. Activities and Readings for Appreciation During the time for reading and discussion of this lesson some part may well be spent in a study of modern prayer found in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 109. The following may possibly be classified as a poem of exaltation:. That thy church may come forth out of the wilderness of darkness, and shine forth fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners; and be adorned as a bride for that day when thou shalt unveil the heavens, and cause the mountains to flow down at thy presence, and the valleys to be exalted, the rough places made smooth; that thy glory may fill the earth; that when the trump shall sound for the dead, we shall be caught up in the cloud to meet thee, that we may ever be with the Lord; that our garments may be pure, that we may be clothed upon with robes of righteousness, with palms in our hands, and crowns of glory upon our heads, and reap eternal joy for all our sufferings. O Lord God Almighty, hear us in these our petitions, and answer us from heaven, thy holy habitation, where thou sittest enthroned, with glory, honor, power, majesty, might, dominion, truth, justice, judgment, mercy, and an infinity of fulness, from everlasting to everlasting. O hear, O hear, O hear us, O Lord! And answer these petitions, and accept the dedication of this house unto thee, the work of our hands, which we have built unto thy name; And also this church, to put upon it thy name. And help us by the power of thy Spirit, that we may mingle our voices with those bright, shining setaphs around thy throne, with acclamations of praise, singing Hosanna to God and the Lamb! And let these, thine anointed ones, be clothed with salvation, and thy saints shout aloud for joy. Amen and Amen (D. & C. 109:73-80). The following questions may help in the study: 1. What are the things a prophet requests in prayer upon an occasion of great public moment? 2. Where are the lyric qualities of the prayer most pronounced? 3. Why would a prayer such as this be recorded in holy writ?  LESSON DEPARTMENT 787 Social Science Essentials in Home Training Lesson 4 The Observance of the Sabbath Day Elder Joseph Jacobs For Tuesday, February 24, 1948 Objective: To show that the command regarding Sabbath day observance is just as binding on us now as it has ever been, and that through training and the formation of proper habits in the home the Sabbath will be spent worshipfully and the attendant blessings received. Why Do We Have the Sabbath Day? THE laxness that exists today in Sabbath observance is one manifestation of the letdown in religion. When the majority of people disregard the "Lord's day," it is a sign of decadence in spiritual matters a spiritual lethargy. It would appear that many question the need of a day in which to worship God. The setting aside of one day in seven to worship an Almighty Creator has come down to us from the very beginning of time. The earliest record we have of a sacred day, as recorded in the Book of Abraham 5:1-2, says: And thus we will finish the heavens and the earth, and all the hosts of them. And the Gods said among themselves: On the seventh time we will end our work... And we will rest on the seventh time from all our work which we have counseled. Also, in Genesis 2:1-3, we read: Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it. Thus, even before the foundation of this world was laid, the blueprint of its creation called for one sacred day in seven. We read elsewhere, referring to this day, that the Lord hallowed it and called it a day of rest. And, again, from, amidst the thunderings and lightnings of Mount Sinai, the word of Jehovah expressly forbade any kind of work to be performed on the Sabbath because it was a holy day. We know that the Savior recognized the Sabbath day as a day of worship, for we read in Luke 4:16, 31: And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.... And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days. Does This Command to Observe the Sabbath Day Apply to Us Now? To those who think that this commandment applied only to ancient Israel and that times have changed now, the following revelation, given in our day, is called to their attention: And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day; for verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and to pay thy devotions unto the Most High... But remember that on this, the Lord's day, thou shalt offer thy oblations and thy sacraments unto the Most High, confessing thy sins unto thy brethren, and before the Lord. And on this day thou shalt do none other thing, only let thy food be prepared with singleness of heart that thy fasting may be perfect, or in other words, that thy joy may be full (D. & C. 59:9-14). 
Is the Sabbath Day Designed for Recreation?
Every president of the Church has felt impressed to make some positive statement regarding the observance of the Sabbath. We quote from only two. President Brigham Young spoke as follows:
Now, remember, my brethren, those who go skating, buggy riding or on excursions on the Sabbath day�and there is a great deal of this practiced�are weak in the faith. Gradually, little by little, the spirit of their religion leaks out of their hearts and their affections, and by and by they begin to see faults in their brethren, faults in the doctrines of the Church, faults in the organization. . . . (Discourses of Brigham Young, page 255; 1941 edition, page 165).
President Joseph F. Smith said:
The Sabbath is a special day for you to worship, to pray, and to show zeal and ardor in your religious faith and duty�to pay devotions to the Most High. . . . Men are not made to be put to severe labor upon that day, but they plow, and plant and haul and dig. They are not taxing when they linger around the home all day on Sunday, doing odd jobs that they have been too busy to do on other days.
Men are not showing zeal and ardor in their religious faith and duty when they hustle off early Sunday morning on the cars, with teams, in automobiles, to the canyons, the resorts, and to visit friends or places of amusement, with their wives and children. . . . They are not paying their devotions in the way to the Most High,
Not in seeking pleasure and recreation upon that holy time, and attention in the worship of the Lord, nor can they thus rejoice in the spirit of forgiveness and worship that comes with partaking of the holy sacrament. . . . Such is not the course that will keep them unspotted from the world, but rather one that will deprive them of the rich promises of the Lord, give them sorrow instead of joy, and unrest and anxiety instead of the peace that comes with works of righteousness.
Let us play and take recreation to our heart' content during other days, but on the Sabbath let us rest, worship, go to the house of prayer, partake of the sacrament, eat our food with singleness of heart, and pay our devotions to God, that the fulness of the earth may be ours, and that we may have peace in this world and eternal life in the world to come (Essentials: Joseph F. Smith; Gospel Doctrine, Chap ter 14, pp. 307, 309).
To advance arguments in favor of taking no daily nourishment for the sustenance of the physical body would be considered very foolish. Yet there are many who fail to take seriously the advice of our leaders who tell us that our spirits need nourishment and strength just as well as our bodies. The Lord has ordained that we spend six days out of seven for rest and the feeding of the body and one day out of seven for rest and the feeding of the spirit. The more human and subject to many temptations. This being so, it is the tendency to favor the physical desires far above their due proportion. President Brigham Young said:
We are under the necessity of assembling here from Sabbath to Sabbath, and in Ward meetings . . . , to teach, talk, pray, sing, and exhort. What for? To keep us in remembrance of our God and our holy religion. Is this custom necessary? Yes, because we are so liable to forget�so prone to wander . . . . (Discourses of Brigham Young, page 165). LESSON DEPARTMENT What Factors Influence Sabbath Day Observance? There is much in the attitude families take toward Sabbath day observance, and in the habits they incorporate into their lives. Certain standards must be set up and adhered to. If the mother and father from the outset of marriage set the proper example, then the children will grow up accepting the proper procedure for that day. They will usually conform willingly if the proper type of Sunday conduct has been the rule. True, especially when boys and girls reach adolescence, if their associates take part in unseemly activities on the Sabbath day, they may want to go along with them. They may be ridiculed if they do not, and many young people are not strong enough +o take ridicule, and so they rebel at the restraint imposed upon them. This is one big reason why they should be particular in choosing friends. Weare all influenced greatly by the companions we have. In an article titled "Companionship," Elder Adam S. Bennion tells of giving a talk to a group of men in a penitentiary and of some of the things they told him after the talk: But what they did say without exception was: "We're here because we got in with the wrong crowd." Will you be good enough to look across your friendship list? Who are your friends, and how did you come to have them? Don't you sometimes look back and wonder?... I have talked with boys and asked, "Why do you go with this particular boy?" Almost invariably the answer is, "I just picked up with him...." Out of ten thousand people that may live in your vicinity particularly, how many do you know? What friends have you chosen and why? I'd like to offer this suggestion while you're young. Why not cast about to find the friends that you'd choose to put in the roll that 789 you're going to keep. That's a matter of There isn't a boy who can't go out and in a few days meet ten other boys, one of whom will make his whole life different. Have you met the kind of fellow who is lifting you up? Are you meeting the kind of people that you are proud of or happy to meet, or have you just chanced into a friendship? Consider carefully, the C of chance and the C of choice. How May We Prepare for Sunday? When the Sabbath approaches, we must be prepared to observe it in a proper manner. We should do all we can to feed and elevate the spirit and give it the bread of eternal life. And, conversely, we should refrain from doing those things that are contrary or out of harmony with the spirit of a sacred Sabbath. Nothing should be done which will detract from the sacredness of that day. Concerted effort should go toward planning for the Sabbath day. 'The preparation beforehand of clothing and food for that day contributes greatly to its proper observance. Many of us remember the days of our childhood when Saturday night was spent in polishing shoes, bathing, and laying out freshly laundered clothing for wear at Sunday School the next morning. Planning for the Sunday dinner on Saturday will eliminate unnecessary work. Many mothers work more in the preparation of the Sunday meal than any other; but we should remember the words of the Lord: ''Let thy food be prepared with singleness of heart." There are many dishes that can easily be prepared the day before. One family had the habit of spending Saturday evening studying and preparing Sunday School lessons for the following day. 790 "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath." Such was the rebuke of the Master to those who prescribed ridiculous and fantastic rules for Sabbath day observance and tried to trap him. Since the Sabbath was made for man, man should have the right attitude toward it. The Sabbath is not a deprivation designed to impoverish, but is rather a high privilege designed to make life truly rich and joyful. It is largely a question of one's spiritual and intellectual capacity to devote one day out of seven to high spiritual pursuits. That capacity should be developed by all if they would truly live. Since the Creator ordained one day exclusively for rest and worship, the Church, of course, offers its members opportunities for worship on that day. A member who faithfully observes the Sabbath will probably be led to faithfully dis- ~ charge his other obligations to the Lord. ~ a loving Father, suited to his children living in this earth he created for them, to enable them to be true to themselves and to him. These are his words concerning it: "And inasmuch as ye do these things with thanksgiving, with cheerful hearts and countenances, not with much laughter, for this is sin, but with a glad heart and a cheerful countenance verily I say, that inasmuch as ye do this, the fulness of the earth is yours....
