Entertaining at a Cabin in the Canyon Ethel Colton Smith WITH summer here again and the beauties of the canyons beckoning to the out-of-doors, our thoughts tum once more to trips and outings. If yours is a family of outdoor enthusiasts, no doubt your home has already been the scene of exciting activity in preparation for the first canyon trip the season. If you count among your family possessions 4 cabin in the canyon, the conversation at your dinner table has probably been running some thing like this: " wonder if that outsized rainbow trout in the hole below the bridge will have forgotten the time we almost landed him last summer and will be lured to the hook by the special fly we have for him now." "Do you suppose the porch step has been scraped thin by the old grandfather porcupine who developed such a fondness for that spot last summer after the dog spilled his pan of milk there?" Being the mother in a home where such things are going on, you, too, may be excited and eager to begin the summer fun. Or perhaps your enthusiasm lags a little because you realize all too well the amount of work involved in the trips now being planned. You may be seeing in your mind's eye the many little boys who are eagerly awaiting their turn to be invited by your son for two OT three days at the cabin, little boys who seem to have such bottomless Page 406 cavities inside their small bodies which they are intent on filling at frequent intervals all through the day. It may be your daughter's crowd of adolescent girls that you picture, who will keep you awake far into the night with their talking and laughing. Or perhaps you are thinking of different groups of your own friends whom you will want to invite for overnight or a few days, and you are wondering what dishes you can prepare that will satisfy appetites sharpened by the mountain air. If your canyon home is situated close enough to the city so that you enjoy the conveniences of electricity, water in the house, and the many other things which make housekeeping easier, your summer entertaining will be greatly simplified. But if the members of your family are rugged individuals who prefer to take their outdoor life far from the "beaten track," away from these very conveniences, then it may appear to you that your summer is going to be filled with more work than rest. Should you find yourself in this state of mind, you may be making more work than is necessary out of your canyon trips, and it is possible that you need to do some planning and organizing. Here are a few sug: gestions which may help: Plan your parties so that everyone will share in the work as well as the fun. If certain duties are assigned to each person, the work becomes ENTERTAINING AT A CABIN IN THE CANYON light and everyone has a part in the activities. Appoint a specific number of persons to take care of each meal, preparing and serving it and cleaning up afterwards. Many times the men will want to help with the cooking. Some men pride themselves on their ability to prepare a certain dish in a special way, or to cook a steak perfectly. If there are such men in any group you invite, let them display their talents along this line. Children can help by making their own beds, carrying in logs for the fireplace, and setting the table for meals. To simplify the laundry problem have your guests bring their own bed | linen if they are to spend the night. Instead of using tablecloths, cover your table with colorful, easy-to-wash oilcloth or the new plastic material now being shown in the stores for this purpose; and use paper napkins for each meal. Have a supply of paper cups and plates on hand as there are occasions when these can be used to save dishwashing. When given an opportunity to go to the canyon for a day or more, most people like to relax and rest from their usual strenuous activities. A. Thoughtful host and hostess will make available plenty of comfortable places where guests may rest and will not insist that everyone play games or go on hikes. There will, of course, be some in almost any group who will want to go fishing, or participate in some vigorous outdoor sport such as a game of baseball, horseshoe pitching, or horseback riding. Equipment should be available so that such activities may be indulged in, if desired. If an atmosphere of friendly informality can be established with guests relaxed and at ease, feeling at liberty to do just what they want to do, it is certain that everyone will have an enjoyable time and no great effort will be required to see that guests are entertained.

They want to play games, ride horses, go on hikes, or swim. In the interest of safety, it will be necessary to make some simple rules which children should be required to follow when taking part in such sports in the canyon. An older person should accompany small children on hikes. A reasonable time should be set for the return of any group of hikers, even the older children, and they should be taught to stay together in one group, with no one wandering off by himself. A time limit should be placed on their play in the water, and their swimming in rivers or lakes should be supervised. If children are spending the night, an inspection should be made for woodticks which they may have acquired from contact with brush and bushes. Photograph by Ralph D. Wright FOOTBRIDGE ACROSS WEBER RIVER AT CABIN OF MR. AND MRS. ELWIN F. SMITH, PINES RANCH, UPPER WEBRE RIVER Simple safety rules such as these are necessary although they need not be made restrictive and burdensome. ET us consider the matter of food, which is of great importance on any canyon party. Plan menus composed of simple but filling dishes. Take advantage of the wide variety of canned foods which can be obtained today. Stock your cupboards with such items as canned soups, chili, baked beans, pork and beans, Vienna sausage, and other prepared meats, tuna fish, canned vegetables, and fruits. 'These can be used for hurry-up meals and can be transformed into appetizing dishes with little effort. For instance, a lowly can of pork and beans can become quite glamorous when prepared in this fashion: Brown some chopped onions, add chopped celery, green pepper, and canned tomatoes. Simmer for fifteen minutes. Add canned pork and beans and heat thoroughly. If additional seasoning is desired, a dash of chili powder or savory salt adds piquancy. The amount of the ingredients will vary according to taste and the number of people to be served. Canned chili, combined with canned baked beans or pork and beans, is delicious. This should be accompanied by rye bread and butter. Canned meats can be removed from the tin and browned in the oven, or sliced and browned on top of the stove. These are good served with scrambled eggs and sliced tomatoes. A quick oyster stew can be made with canned oysters. Simmer them in their own juice until the edges curl; add a smell! Amount of chopped onion which has _ been browned in butter, and milk and seasoning to taste. Serve this with some split hard rolls or slices of French bread which have been spread with grated cheese and heated. It is a good idea to have plenty of snack materials on hand for hungry hikers and fishermen. These may consist of sandwich fillings, fresh and dried fruits, and cookies, in addition to the items already mentioned. It is important to have plenty of cool drinks on hand. Miulk, lemonade, and various fruit punches are popular. For the fruit drinks, bottled fruit concentrates may be used, or canned fruit juices, or fresh lemon, orange, lime, and other juices which have been prepared beforehand and put into bottles. Breakfasts in the canyon should be substantial meals as most guests sleep later than they do at home and will arise with appetites whetted by the invigorating mountain air. However, this meal can be prepared very easily if you will take advantage of ENTERTAINING AT A CABIN IN THE CANYON 409 410 the many prepared foods available. Have on hand a good variety of prepared cereals and _ fruits�either canned or fresh. Hot biscuits, muffins, hot pancakes can be made with prepared flours; or spread sliced bread with butter, place on a rack, and pop into the oven for a few minutes until slightly browned. These breads call for jam, honey, or syrup as an accompaniment. Ham and eggs, or bacon and eggs, with hashed browned potatoes are always popular with those who like a more hearty breakfast. And, if there are fishermen in the crowd, you will, of course, have mountain trout for your breakfast. Milk, postum, and fruit juices are good breakfast drinks.
