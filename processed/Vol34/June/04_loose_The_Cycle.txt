THE CYCLE Agnes Just Reid For weeks I toiled at some pale gossamer thing To fashion for her coming; Then when she stepped proudly off to school, It was I who sewed each garment, prayer-seamed. And at her graduation, my work adorned her Slim young form. Now I have sewed my triumph, her wedding dress. How flower-like she looked beside her husband! My work is done. Soon she will fashion tiny garments, For life and love go on.
