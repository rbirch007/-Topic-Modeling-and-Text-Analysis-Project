JUNE Lane:   

SONG OF THE WHEELS Ora Pate Stewart Wheels of the prairie are singing to me... Chuckling wheels, in a symphony... Wheels as they munch on a buffalo bone... Then take up the trail through the vast unknown. Tired and hungry, aching wheels, Winding the miles on their axle-reels. Sad wood winds, like a lone tree sighing Under its load... The just one dying... Dying! But never to foul the grave... And a new note rises strong and brave! Wheels that carve in the stony face Of a giant mountain the time and place When courage passed over in wagon trains... A wagon wheel marks the last remains Of one too weary to carry on, And a choir of wheels chants a funeral song. Wheels that chime with a wedding tune; Wheels that muster a staunch platoon; Marching wheels, with a martial beat; Tinkling wheels for dancing feet; Wheels that echo the wild wolf's Cry; Soft wheels humming a lullaby... "Song of the righteous... A prayer unto me..." Father, accept of this symphony. The Cover: "Into the Future," photograph by Boyart Studios,: arrangement by Evan Jensen.
