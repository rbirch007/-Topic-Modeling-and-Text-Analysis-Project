Busy Fingers "She seeketh wool and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands" (Proverbs 31:13). G. W. Staker A real extremity busy fingers do the bidding of the woman in this photograph. Their mistress, Mrs. Janet Stephens of Montpelier, Idaho, is justly proud of their record. Born and reared in historic Bear Lake Valley, Sister Stephens has more than fifty years of service in the Relief Society to her credit. Fourteen years as work director of the Montpelier Second Ward Relief Society have given Sister Stephens ample opportunity to employ her talented fingers in the service of others. To count the number of stitches these ten fingers have taken would be like counting the stars on a clear winter night. Aside from the myriads of stitches taken in Relief Society work meeting, the busy fingers of Sister Stephens have known the glory of creating articles of value and beauty too numerous to mention. Over two hundred quilts, including nine of the lovely flower garden design, have known the touch of these fingers in every stitch. Their industry has been responsible for several dozen exquisite, quilted satin baby-carriage coverlets, four crocheted bedspreads, plus many lace tablecloths, pillow covers, doilies, rugs, sofa pillows, and scarves which brighten the homes of members of her family and the homes of her friends. What joy and satisfaction these busy fingers bring their cheerful mistress as she daily bids them to do their quota in creating treasures of beauty and usefulness! Page 379
