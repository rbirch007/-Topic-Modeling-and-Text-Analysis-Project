SEGO LILIES Evelyn Fjeldsted Beneath a rocky, hillside ledge, Utah's own State flower fair, The sego lily, has designed A lone but regal garden flare. The beauty of each waxen whorl Enhanced by sweet serenity Is graciously and gayly spent In soundless closed obscurity. But on the winds the seeds are borne Across the moorland far and wide, Akin with pioneers they make The barren places bloom with pride. Seeking only untilled fields, Reaching ever toward the light, They symbolize our native State, Once a desert, now a garden site. ENTERTAINING AT A CABIN IN THE CANYON 411
