A Strange Ransom A TRUE PIONEER STORY Ellen Redd Bryner HEIR cherished homes in the beautiful city of Nauvoo were still mourned by the Latter-day Saint refugees. 'The hardships of their trek across the State of Iowa were still remembered. Camped on a tributary of the Missouri River, they were building temporary living quarters. Thrift and industry prevailed among this group of suffering people. Men were busy sawing and dragging logs for their cabins, which must be built and chinked to shelter the families before the cold winds and storms of autumn came. Wives and mothers, too, found little leisure time. In addition to household duties, there were berries, which grew in abundance near the encampment, to be picked and dried to add to the scanty store of foodstuffs. Also, the surplus of the wild game, one of their main sources of food supply, must be cut into pieces, soaked in brine, and hung to dry. The children of the company were happy when following their fathers about and watching them chain several logs together to drag to a home site. Sometimes a group of the children would climb on a pile of chained logs and have a ride as the team of oxen dragged the logs to the place of building. In the forest a short distance away, a band of Indians had set up their wigwams and settled down as neighbors to the Latter-day Saints. Some of the Indian children became friendly with the white boys and girls and sometimes shared in their play. One day, four or five of the Latter-day Saint children and an Indian child climbed on a pile of logs for a ride. Unfortunately, the logs had not been chained firmly. As the oxen started, the logs slipped, throwing the children to the ground. All were unhurt except the Indian boy, who was seriously crushed between two logs. A great agitation arose among the Indians, and the disturbance brought a threat which caused much uneasiness among the saints. "If this papoose die, we kill one white child" these were the words of their chief. Anxiety prevailed in every Latter-day Saint home. The women were untiring in their efforts to assist in caring for the injured boy. They carried food to the wigwam. They bathed and poulticed and prayed unceasingly for the restoration of the afflicted Indian child, who was seriously ill for a long time. Caroline Butler had given of her strength and energy many times to soothe, comfort, and feed the sick child. Then she, herself, became dangerously ill. Her husband John Lowe Butler had gone with his teams and wagons to assist the poorer saints across the State of Iowa, hoping to bring back with him some flour and other provisions for his large, hungry family. In her anxiety over the health of her children, Caroline had regularly given her portion of bread to them so that, though the weather was hot, her diet consisted almost entirely of Page 627 628 fresh meat. This unbalanced diet, combined with the heavy work of caring for a large family, storing food for winter, and her nursing the injured papoose, had made her ill with dysentery. As the days passed she grew weaker from lack of proper food. Her neighbors were kind and anxious for her welfare, but they were unable to furnish her with the food she needed for her recovery. As this good woman lay sick and discouraged, while two neighbor sisters were bathing her almost deathlike face, the Indian chief came from his camp to her door. He was frightened by her appearance and learned from her neighbors the cause of her condition. My mother, Keziah, then a child of about nine years, stood by her mother's bed, feeling the need of a little comfort and encouragement that can only come from a mother to her child. The chief, without explanation, took this child by the and led her out of the house and through the forest to the wigwam. The sick mother who saw her child led away, thought, the Indian papoose has died; my little girl is the ransom; my child is the price of that death. The two neighbor women were speechless and Caroline was too weak to plead in protest, or even to pray. Nota word was spoken as they sat for about a half hour until little Keziah walked in the door with a quart bowl of white flour, a cup of sugar, and a small bag of coffee. The chief had made it plain to the little girl that her mother must not eat any more meat, but. Should have a cake of bread made from this flour every day. The fulfillment of the prayers of this faithful group came with the restoration of the injured papoose. From Caroline's difficult experience, from her extreme suffering and sickness, her soul developed strength and she learned that there is good in the hearts of the red men.

An important feature of this fashion show was the presentation of interesting skits depicting episodes in the life of Mrs. T, a working mother whose twin daughters were costumes of the 1860-1900 period which contrasted vividly with the modern fashions made by the Relief Society mothers. The stage was decorated beautifully, and soft music was played during the promenade of the models. Two hundred guests attended the fashion show which was a credit to the women for the careful designing and expert sewing of their costumes.

LESSON = DEPARTMENT Theology The Life and Ministry of the Savior Lesson 3 "Earthly Advent of the Christ Predicted" "The Meridian of Time" Elder Don B. Colton (Reference: Jesus the Christ (Chapters 5 and 6), by Elder James E. Talmage) For Tuesday, December 2, 1947 Objective: To demonstrate that the great events of the Savior's life and of his plan of salvation had been revealed aforetime; and to give an explanation of the condition of the Jews during the meridian of time. 'SQURELY the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets" (Amos 3:7). Three outstanding prophecies run all the way through the books of the Old Testament: 1. The coming of Messiah or a king. | 2. The scattering of Israel. 3. The gathering of Israel. We shall consider only the first. For more than a thousand years prior to the Lord's advent in the flesh, the tribes of Israel had been looking for a great deliverer and leader. Only the prophets seem to have realized fully in what manner he would appear. Moses wrote the Pentateuch, or the five books of the law, in about 1451 B. C. There followed after him a long line of prophets, nearly all of whom promised the Jews that their king was coming. These promises, though more or less indistinct and uncertain, were a great comfort and Page 636 source of hope to the chosen people. They are edifying and stimulating today. We should remember that the twelve books following Deuteronomy were written by appointed historians. 'These historians wrote much that is difficult to understand, because we are unfamiliar with many of the events of their day. The history which was written was and is priceless. Truly, the Lord verified his promise to Abraham. He made of Israel a great nation (Gen. 12:1-3). Whether we study the utterances of divinely commissioned prophets or the writings of inspired poets, we will find they are all rich in promises of the coming of a Messiah. Adam, the father of the human race, knew of the coming of a Savior and rejoiced in the wonderful: explanation given by the angel (Moses 5:6-9). Other great prophets between Adam and Abraham knew and rejoiced because of the great LESSON DEPARTMENT plan of salvation. 'The first great prophecy recorded in Jewish scripture of the Messiah's coming is recorded in Gen. 49:10. A learned Jew in New York once said to the writer of these lessons: "We think also Jacob referred in that promise to the coming of a king or Messiah, but we have no proof that Jesus of Nazareth fulfilled that prophecy." He was invited to study the history of Judah. He was willing to admit that "Shiloh" meant king one yet to come and that scepter connoted kingly authority. Judah was to reign in Palestine and interpret the law until Shiloh came. Herod, who was king of the Jews when Christ came, was the first foreigner to reign over Judah after the settlement in Palestine. After the Savior was crucified and the temple destroyed, no direct descendant of Judah has since reigned over Palestine. Reread the prophecy in the light of these statements. Moses spoke of the raising up of a great prophet (Deut. 18:15-19). In fact, the system of sacrifices established by Moses was "essentially a prototype of the sacrificial death to be accomplished by the Savior on Calvary." The prophets all knew that the sacrifices offered up were in similitude of the final offering of the Son of God. In the Psalms, we find frequent reference or allusion to the coming of and the work of Christ. Probably, no prophet of pre-Messianic time had a clearer vision of the Redeemer than did Isaiah: Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the 637 chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his-own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth. He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? For he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken (Isaiah 53:4-8). The entire chapter should be read. Zechariah interrupted his prophecy concerning the restoration of Israel in the latter day to tell that the Savior would come and _ that his hands would be wounded in the house of his friends. Nearly all of the books of the Old Testament are rich in the promise of the coming of a Messiah. The visions concerning the coming of our Lord, given to the prophets upon the eastern hemisphere, were also given explicitly to the prophets on the western hemisphere. The Book of Mormon is a history of a colony of Israelites, descendants of Joseph who was sold into Egypt. This group of people left Jerusalem about 600 B. C. Some of them were devout and wonderful prophets to whom the knowledge of the coming Redeemer was given with great plainness. Perhaps none saw more clearly than Lehi, the leader of the colony. His son Nephi records: Yea, even six hundred years from the time that my father left Jerusalem, a prophet would the Lord God raise up among the Jews even a Messiah, or, in other words, a Savior of the world (1 Nephi 10:4). 638 (It is recommended that members read all of Chapter 10.) Nephi saw not only that the Savior would be born, but saw also in vision many of the events which would occur following the birth. The prophet Abinadi speaks of the Godship of the Christ and says that he is "the very Eternal Father of heaven and of earth" (Mosiah 15:4). He meant, of course, in the sense that he created the world and is, therefore, its father. This great man saw that Jesus the Redeemer would be God and would come down among the "children of men, and shall redeem his people." Furthermore, just five years before the event, it was given to Samuel, the Lamanite, to know the time of Messiah's birth. The Meridian of Time This expression is frequently used. In its broad sense, the word meridian connotes principal divisions of time and space. Usually, it means noontime or the highest point the sun attains in its daily course. In all Christian countries, the years of human history are divided by the time of the birth of Jesus Christ. We speak of the time before that event as B. C., meaning before Christ, and after as A. D., or "in the year of the Lord." A. D. Comes from the Latin words anno Domini. The plan of thus dividing time was also used by the Nephites. An understanding of the political, social, and religious condition of the world when the Savior was born, is necessary to a clear comprehension of his life and works. It seems necessary to give just a brief resume of the Israelitish history. The name of Jacob, a grandson of Abraham, was changed to Israel. 'The descendants of Abraham became known as the children of Israel. They were designated as Israelites from the time they were in bondage in Egypt until the conclusion of the reign of Solomon. After his death, the tribe of Judah, part of the tribe of Benjamin, and remnants of other tribes remained loyal to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, while the rest of the Israelites made Jeroboam, an Ephraimite, their king. The latter group came to be known as the Ten Tribes, sometimes called Ephraim, or the kingdom of Israel. The two kingdoms maintained a separate status for about two hundred and fifty years. In about 721 B. C., the kingdom of Israel was destroyed and the captives were carried to the nations lying to the north. They later disappeared so completely as to be referred to thereafter as the Lost Tribes. The kingdom of Judah continued for another one hundred and fifty years when the people were made captives and taken to Babylon. Judah was in exile for about seventy years, when they were liberated by decree of Cyrus the Persian. Most of the Hebrew people returned to Judea. However, this constituted only a fraction of the original Israelitish people. While they tried hard to reestablish Jewish greatness, the Jews were never again an entirely independent people. The temple service was again established. The sacred temple was rededicated about 163 B. C. Under Roman domination, the Jews were permitted to carry on their religious ceremonials and to exercise judicial powers except in cases of capital punishment. They could put no one to death without the consent of the Roman officials. LESSON DEPARTMENT Under the law of Moses, the Jews had been required to keep apart from other nations. They were proud of their lineage and took a "holier-than-thou" position. This attitude frequently caused clashes with other peoples. They were allowed to read only Jewish books. They were enjoined to study and become thoroughly conversant with Jewish laws. They, however, were not a united people. In fact, after their return from the Babylonian exile, they divided into many sects and other contending organizations. The scholars and there were many of them were known as scribes. Many of these were honored with the title of rabbi or teacher. Many of these men rendered an excellent service by compiling and preserving sacred records. Ezra and Nehemiah were leaders in this work. We are indebted to the scribes for some of the finest literature, philosophy, and ancient history found anywhere in the world. The twelve historical books of the Old Testament are invaluable. 'The five poetical books contain gems of philosophy unsurpassed. 'These, of course, were inspired of God. The scribes and rabbis were more highly honored by the people than were the orders of the priesthood. The people became divided into many religious sects. The leading orders or denominations were the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Essenes, the Nazarites, the Herodians, and the Galileans. The Pharisees were, by far, the largest group. The scribes usually united with them. Paul said in his defense before Agrippa: "After the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee 639 That sentence gives us a key. They all professed a belief in the Mosaic Law, but differed in their interpretation thereof. 'The Pharisees were very strict in their interpretation not only of the law of Moses, but also all rabbinical teachings were closely studied and often disputed. They contended much with other sects and among themselves. The Sadducees contended for strict compliance with the Mosaic law as they construed it, especially the penalties "an eye for an eye, and a tooth fora tooth." They did not believe in the resurrection. Space will not permit a more detailed examination of the various Jewish sects. We must mention that the authority of the priesthood was, at least, outwardly recognized by the Jews, when the Savior came. While the priests were inferior to the scribes, they were permitted to officiate in the sacred ceremonials of the temple. However, the religion of the day consisted almost entirely of forms and ceremonials. The state of the world, at the time the Savior was born, was one of comparative peace. There were fewer wars than the Roman Empire had known for many years. The time was favorable for his advent. Questions and Suggestions for Discussion 1. Point out some of the outstanding prophecies of the scriptures concerning the coming of the Messiah, Illustrate the clarity of the Book of Mormon prophecies. 2. Discuss the religious and political condition of the Jews during the meridian of time. 3. To a study of what subjects was Jewish learning restricted? Visiting Teachers' Messages Our Pioneer Heritage Lesson 3 Religious Activities President Amy Brown Lyman For Tuesday, December 2, 1947 Objective: their activities. HE religious zeal of the pioneers was due to their testimonies of the truthfulness of the restored gospel; and their desire to live up to this knowledge. Because of their testimonies they were willing to leave their homes and friends, and to give up their former religious affiliations; willing to endure hardships and persecutions and to undergo physical and mental suffering; willing and determined to live the gospel, cost what it might. And because of their testimonies they were strengthened to endure their hard and trying experiences, and in turn, by these very experiences, their testimonies were strengthened. From the time the new light came to them, it was the great and driving force in their lives. Religion with the pioneers was not merely a Sunday affair, but played a most important part in their daily lives. Religious observances and activities were fostered and practiced from the beginning, in the homes, in the temporary settlements en route to the West, on the plains, and, finally, in the permanent settlements, and all in spite of physical hardships and handicaps, limited resources, and long and arduous hours of toil and labor for mere subsistence. There was always time for religion. The pioneers were a praying, church-going, That we may review the religious practices of the pioneers and emulate scripture-reading people. The holding of family prayers was a common practice, with each member, in turn, being voice. The Sabbath was strictly observed. Churchgoing was popular, even with children, and partaking of the sacrament was regarded as a privilege and special blessing. One of the most interesting places for children to go was to Sunday School, even though, in most instances, those in classes sat on long benches, and one Bible was passed along, giving each child a chance to read a verse. Fast Day was observed on Thursday, a weekday, a working day, when the fast was observed by every faithful member, and men and women, farmers, merchants, and all the people left their work, whatever it was, to attend meeting, where they opened their hearts to one another in testimony, and were comforted and uplifted. Conferences, ward, stake, and general, provided opportunity for broader experiences, for widening horizons, and for general standardization of work. Most of the pioneers were familiar with the Bible. It, with other Church works, was found on the old center tables in the parlors. One of the vivid memories of the writer is that of her mother reading aloud  LESSON DEPARTMENT from the large, attractive, old "Family Bible," with its heavy cover and large print, and quoting lovely passages from it to fit any conversation. The "Family Bible" was sacred, not only because it was holy scripture, but because it contained the vital statistics of the family, such as marriages, births, and deaths. With all the duties and heavy responsibilities of the pioneers, they did not forget nor overlook the importance of missionary work, in accordance with the command of the Savior, "Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature" (Mark 16:15). 641 Men responded promptly to calls to serve as missionaries, even in their darkest, most trying days, leaving their homes and their families, at a time when they seemed to be in desperate need of life's bare necessities. The faithful, understanding wives and children, however, supported their husbands and fathers in this great and vital service. Suggestions for Discussion Let the teachers: a. Tell of religious activities in their own pioneer homes and communities; b. Tell of early missionary experiences of members of their families.  Work Meeting Sewing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting) Lesson 2 Choosing a Pattern Jean Ridges Jennings For Tuesday, November 11, 1947 CHOOSING a pattern for the garment to be made is a very important step in the process of acquiring something to wear, and, as many women have discovered, can be a very difficult task. A pattern well selected goes a long way toward insuring the success of the finished article. It is often very difficult for an inexperienced person, and sometimes even for one who has had extensive training, to visualize just how a certain fashion feature will look on her. Often the attractive drawing of a dress on the figure in the fashion magazine bears little resemblance to the picture of the finished garment on oneself. We must remember that the pictures portray ideally proportioned figures which may be taller and slimmer than our own. Unless you know how well you can wear a flared peplum, a cutaway jacket, a barrel sleeve, the new tiered skirt, or similar fashion foibles, you should, if possible, first try on garments that have these details before buying a pattern which features them. You may discover that your dreamed of dress is not for you. No matter how much you admire certain styles, you must leave them alone if they do not become you. Strive always to suit your own personality in selecting your clothes. When you go to the store to choose your pattern, keep in mind the following points: 1. Be sure the style you choose is appropriate to the occasions for which the dress is to be worn. 2. Select a style that will be suitable for the material to be used. 3. Suit the pattern to your figure type. When we tell you to choose a style appropriate to the occasion, we suggest that you first take into consideration the type of life that you lead. Simplicity is the keynote to a well-balanced wardrobe. By selecting simple lines and avoiding the pitfalls of too many intricate details, you can save yourself many disappointments and insure yourself of more happiness in wearing your clothes. In selecting a style appropriate to the material to be used, we suggest that you remember that cottons and washable materials should be made up in styles that are simple and easy to launder. Soft silks, sheers, and jerseys lend themselves nicely to the currently draped and softened lines. Stiffer, heavier materials must be used for the more tailored styles and they depend largely on self-trim for interest. Last, but most important, is to suit the pattern to the figure type. Strive to play up your good features and minimize your bad ones. Large figures should avoid slick, shiny, heavily figured fabrics. 'They should also avoid styles with a great deal of detail or too many lines. Slight figures can better use more elaborate features. If in doubt, be moderate. The first rule of good fashion is suitability and becomingness to you as an individual. Be true to yourself. If the current trends are unsuited to your particular type, stay in the conservative middle lane, and you will always appear more attractive. Literature of the Doctrine and Covenants Lesson 3 Types of Literature Found in the Doctrine and Covenants Elder H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, December 16, 1947 Objective: To appreciate the Doctrine and Covenants as literature through a discussion of the various forms of literature contained in the revealed word of the Lord. N_ the Doctrine and Covenants there are many forms of literature. There are examples of epistles, apocalyptic literature of the visionary type, prayers, exposition of a doctrinal nature, erotesis, the rhetorical question type of writing, which is often used with impressive literary effect, and Targums, known in Hebrew literature as the type of exposition which explains the scripture. Yes, and there are even examples of the lyric or song, together with the exalted rhapsody which includes a fusion of literary form such as_ the drama, vision, judgment, and revelations. Of all the forms mentioned in the Doctrine and Covenants, four are more complete in sufficient amount  LESSON DEPARTMENT to study in separate lessons. These may be named as epistles, visions, prayers, and doctrinal exposition or instruction. Since, in this lesson, we are considering a survey of the types of literature found in this modern scripture, we will include all the forms but briefly to carry out an over-all review. The direct and fervent appeal of one who cannot be present to carry his message in person, but must live out his thoughts through his pen, is found in the type of literature we call the epistle. Often such writing reaches the literary heights. Note the following section of the Doctrine and Covenants in this light: Now, what do we hear in the gospel which we have received? A voice of gladness! A voice of mercy from heaven; and a voice of truth out of the earth; glad tidings for the dead; a voice of gladness for the living and the dead; glad tidings of great joy. How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those that bring glad tidings of good things, and that say unto Zion: Behold, thy God reigneth! As the dews of Carmel, so shall the knowledge of God descend upon them! And again, what do we hear? Glad tidings from Cumorah! Moroni, an angel from heaven, declaring the fulfilment of the prophets the book to be revealed. A voice of the Lord in the wilderness of Fayette, Seneca county, declaring the three witnesses to bear record of the book! The voice of Michael on the banks of the Susquehanna, detecting the devil when he appeared as an angel of light! The voice of Peter, James, and John in the wilderness between Harmony, Susquehanna county, and Colesville, Broome county, on the Susquehanna river, declaring themselves as possessing the keys of the kingdom, and of the dispensation of the fulness of times! And again, the voice of God in. The chamber of old Father Whitmer, in Fayette, Seneca county, and at sundry times, and in divers places through all the travels 643 and tribulations of this Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints! And the voice of Michael, the archangel; the voice of Gabriel, and of Raphael, and of divers angels, from Michael. Or Adam down to the present time, all declaring their dispensation, their rights, their keys, their honors, their majesty and glory, and the power of their priesthood; giving line upon line, precept upon precept; here a little, and there a little; giving us consolation by holding forth that which is to come, confirming our hope Brethren, shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren; and on, on to victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad. Let the earth break forth into singing. Let the dead speak forth anthems of eternal praise to the King Immanuel, who hath ordained, before the world was, that which would enable us to redeem them out of their prison; for the prisoners shall go free. Let the mountains shout for joy, and all ye valleys cry aloud; and all ye seas and dry lands tell the wonders of your Eternal King! And ye rivers, and brooks, and rills, flow down with gladness. Let the woods and all the trees of the field praise the Lord; and ye solid rocks weep for joy! And let the sun, moon, and the morning-stars sing together, and let all the sons of God shout for joy. And let the eternal creations declare his name forever and ever! And again I say, how glorious is the voice ~we hear from heaven, proclaiming in our ears, glory, and salvation, and honor, and immortality, and eternal life; kingdoms, principalities, and powers! Behold, the great day of the Lord is at hand; and who can abide the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appeareth? For he is like a refiner's fire, and like fuller's soap; and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness. Let us, therefore, as a church and a people, and as Latter-day Saints, offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness; and let us present in his holy temple, when it is finished, a book containing the records of our dead, which shall be worthy of all acceptation.  
Brethren, I have many things to say to you on the subject; but shall now close for the present, and continue the subject another time, through our beloved, your humble servant and never deviating friend, Joseph Smith (125:10-25).
The lofty type of literature that upholds and sustains the saints often was given in periods of travail and suffering. This kind of writing is visionary in style and is exalted in tone. Note this passage from the Doctrine and Covenants:
The veil was taken from our minds, and the eyes of our understanding were opened. We saw the Lord standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit, before us; and under his feet was a paved work of pure gold, in color like amber. His eyes were as a flame of fire; the hair of his head was white like the pure snow; his countenance shone above the brightness of the sun; and his voice was as the sound of the rushing of great waters, even the voice of Jehovah, saying: I am the first and the last; I am he who liveth, I am he who was slain; I am your advocate with the Father. Behold, your sins are forgiven you; you are clean before me; therefore, lift up your heads and rejoice. Let the hearts of your brethren rejoice, and let the hearts of all my people rejoice, who have, with their might, built this house to my name (110:1-6).
An example of an inspired prayer of the Prophet Joseph Smith, written in jail at Liberty, Missouri, follows:
O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place? How long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine eye, yea thy pure eye, behold from the eternal heavens the wrongs of thy people and of thy servants, and thine ear be penetrated with their cries? Yea, O Lord, how long shall they suffer these wrongs and unlawful oppressions, before thine heart shall be softened toward them, and thy bowels moved with compassion toward them? O Lord God Almighty, maker of heaven, earth, and seas, and of all things that in them are, and who knowest
and subjectest the devil, and the dark and benighted dominions of Sheol�stretch forth thy hand; let thine eye pierce; let thy pavilion be taken from thy hiding place no longer be covered; let thine ear be inclined; let thine heart be softened, and thy bowels moved with compassion toward us. Let thine anger be kindled against our enemies; and, in the fury of thine heart, with thy sword avenge us of our wrongs. Remember thy suffering saints, O our God; and thy servants will rejoice in thy name forever (121:1-6).
The Lord often speaks to his children through his Prophet in language powerful and quick. From a literary point of view such writing is expository and doctrinal in nature, but often, too, it is filled with poetic figures. Study the lines of this revelation explaining a pattern of good life:
Wherefore, lift up your hearts and rejoice, and gird up your loins, and take upon you my whole armor, that ye may be able to withstand the evil day, having done all, that ye may be able to stand. Stand, therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, having on the breastplate of righteousness, and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace, which I have sent mine angels to commit unto you; Taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked; And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of my Spirit, which I will pour out upon you, and my word which I reveal unto you, and be agreed as touching all things whatsoever ye ask of me, and be faithful until I come, and ye shall be caught up, that where I am ye shall be also. Amen (27:15-18).
Divine instruction is often given in literary forms. Note the effect of the rhetorical questions used by the Lord in the following section of the Doctrine and Covenants:
Verily thus saith the Lord unto my servant William Marks, and also unto my servant Newel K. Whitney, let them settle up their business speedily and journey from LESSON DEPARTMENT the land of Kirtland, before I, the Lord, send again the snows upon the earth. Let them: awake, and arise, and come forth, and not tarry, for I, the Lord, command it. Therefore, if they tarry it shall not be well with them. - Let them repent of all their sins, and of all their covetous desires, before me, saith the Lord; for what is property unto me? Saith the Lord.. Let properties of Kirtland be turned out for debts, saith the Lord. Let them go, saith the Lord, and whatsoever remaineth, let it remain in your hands, saith the Lord. For have I not the: fowls of heaven, and also the fish of the sea, and the beasts of the mountains? Have I not made the earth? Do I not hold the destinies of all the armies of the nations of the earth? Therefore, will I not make solitary places to bud and to blossom, and to bring forth in Is there not room enough on the mountains of Adam that you should covet that which is but the drop, and neglect the more weighty matters? Therefore, come up hither unto the land of my people, even Zion (117: 1-9) Another form of the Hebraic style of writing is classified as the Targum. Here, other existing scripture is interpreted not explained: Q. What is the sea of glass spoken of by John, 4th chapter, and 6th verse of the Revelation? A. It is the earth, in its sanctified, immortal, and eternal state. What are we to understand by the four beasts, spoken of in the same verse? A. They are figurative expressions, used by the Revelator, John, in describing heaven, the paradise of God, the happiness of man, and of beasts, and of creeping things, and of the fowls of the air; that which is spiritual being in the likeness of that which is temporal; and that which is temporal in the likeness of that which is spiritual; the spirit of man in the likeness of his person, as also the spirit of the beast, and every other creature which God has created (77: 1-2). For the pure element of literary excellence in emotions, perhaps none 645 is greater than the song or lyric and the rhapsody. Consider the next two selections, the first might be called a psalm or poem, while the second, a rhapsody in type, is a fusion, in part, of literary forms such as would be found in drama, lyric, narrative or prophetic writings: The Lord hath brought again Zion; The Lord hath redeemed his people, Israel, According to the election of grace, Which was brought to pass by the faith And covenant of their fathers. The Lord hath redeemed his people; And Satan is bound and time ls no longer. The Lord hath gathered all things in one. The Lord hath brought down Zion from above. The Lord hath brought up Zion from beneath. The earth hath travailed and brought forth her strength; And truth is established in her bowels; And the heavens have smiled upon her; And she is clothed with the glory of her God; For he stands in the midst of his people. Glory, and honor, and power, and might, Be ascribed to our God; for he is full of mercy, Justice, grace and truth, and peace. Forever and ever, Amen. (84:99-102)- And now, verily saith the Lord, that these things might be known among you,   inhabitants of the earth, I have sent forth mine angel flying through the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel, who hath appeared unto some and hath committed it unto man, who shall appear nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people. And the servants of God shall go forth, saying with a loud voice: Fear for the hour of his judgment is come, and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and name of the Lord day and night, saying: O that thou wouldst rend the heavens, that thou wouldst come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence. And it shall be answered upon their heads; 646 for the presence of the Lord shall be as the melting fire that burneth, and as the fire which causeth the waters to boil. O Lord, thou shalt come down to make thy name known to thine adversaries, and all nations shall tremble at thy presence. When thou doest terrible things, things they look not for; yea, when thou comest down, and the mountains flow down at thy presence, thou shalt meet him who rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, who remembereth thee in thy ways. For since the beginning of the world have not men heard nor perceived by the ear, neither hath any eye seen, O God, besides thee, how great things thou hast prepared for. Him that waiteth for thee. And it shall be said: Who is this that cometh down from God in heaven with dyed garments; yea, from the regions which are not known, clothed in his glorious apparel, traveling in the greatness of his strength? And he shall say: I am he who spake in righteousness, mighty to save. And the Lord shall be red in his apparel, and his garments like him that treadeth in the wine-vat. And so great shall be the glory of his presence that the sun shall hide his face in shame, and the moon shall withhold its light, and the stars shall be hurled from their places. And his voice shall be heard: I have trodden the wine-press alone, and have brought judgment upon all people; and none were with me. And I have trampled them in my fury, and I did tread upon them in mine anger, and their blood have I sprinkled upon my garments, and stained all my raiment; for this was the day of vengeance which was in my heart. And now the year of my redeemed is come; and they shall mention the loving kindness of their Lord, and all that he has bestowed upon them according to his goodness, and according to his loving kindness, forever and ever. In all their afflictions he was afflicted. And the angel of his presence saved them; and in his love, and in his pity, he redeemed them, and bore them, and carried them all the days of old; yea, and Enoch also, and they who were with him; the prophets who were before him; and Noah also, and they who were before him; and Moses also; and they who were before him; and from Moses to Elijah, and from Elijah to John, who were with Christ in his resurrection, and the holy apostles, with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, shall be in the presence of the Lamb, And the graves of the saints shall be opened; and they shall come forth and stand on the right hand of the Lamb, when he shall stand upon Mount Zion, and upon the holy city, the New Jerusalem; and they shall sing the song of the Lamb, day and night forever and ever. And for this cause, that men might be made partakers of the glories which were to be revealed, the Lord sent forth the fulness of his gospel, his everlasting covenant, reasoning in plainness and simplicity to prepare the weak for those things. Which are coming on the earth, and for the Lord's errand in the day when the weak shall confound the wise, and the little one become a strong nation, and two shall put their tens of thousands to flight. And by the weak things of the earth the Lord shall thrash the nations by the power of his Spirit. And for this cause these commandments were given: they were commanded to be kept from the world in the day that they were given, but now are to go forth unto all flesh and this according to the mind and will of the Lord, who ruleth over all flesh. And unto him that repenteth and sanctifieth himself before the Lord shall be given eternal life. And upon them that hearken not to the voice of the Lord shall be fulfilled that which was written by the prophet Moses, that they should be cut off from among the people. And also that which was written by the prophet Malachi: For, behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch (133:36-64). Activities and Readings for Appreciation In this lesson time should be taken to consider the truth and beauty of the various types of literature found in the Doctrine and Covenants. This can be done by a study of the selections included in the lesson itself with the help of the following questions. Have the passages read aloud LESSON DEPARTMENT after the questions have been answered. 1. Why should a prayer border on the lyric type of literature? 2. Doctrinal exposition is direct. The Lord's word is as a two-edged sword. How is this clear-cut effect of such writing obtained? 647 3. What is a rhetorical question and how is its use effective as a literary pattern of writing? 4. To what does the lyric or psalm appeal? How is its effect carried out in writing? 5. What element of literature on a grand scale is suggested in the rhapsody?
