BEAUTY
Sylvia Probst Young
Today I saw them pass along my street� Three people clothed in beauty each his own: One was fair and young, with dancing feet, And eager eyes that sought a world unknown, In his round, boyish features I could see All of the beauty of expectancy.
The second trod on tired feet and old, His hoary head was bowed, and on his face, Deep furrowed, was a story time had told Of suffering, written on a noble plate. His faded eyes were warmed by memory� Beauty I saw in silent reverie.
The last, a girl who, in her quiet way, Did so much good, passed so much cheer along, While deep within her heart a sorrow lay; But no one knew, they only heard her song. Beauty�she wore it like a shining dress, A beauty nurtured by courageousness
