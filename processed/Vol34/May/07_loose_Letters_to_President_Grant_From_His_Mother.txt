Letters to President Grant From His Mother Rachel Grant Taylor MONG President Grant's personal papers are about fifty letters from his mother, written from 1877 to 1895, when he was traveling, or while she was away from home. These letters were written in the fine script of that day and averaged about four pages in length. Brief excerpts from some of these letters give a glimpse of the desires of President Grant's mother regarding his course in life. In January 1877, Rachel R. Grant, mother of President Heber J. Grant, went to St. George to stay for several months with her sister Anna Ivins, mother of President Anthony W. Ivins. On April 6th of that year the St. George Temple was dedicated. However, there was a dedication of a number of rooms in the building on January 1, 1877, so that endowment work might be carried on. St. George�Feb. 12, 77 Aunt Anna is writing to Uncle Ise, I thought I would write a few lines and that would do for my weekly letter. There is such a good spirit in St. George. You will never know how thankful I feel to think you and Tony are such good Mormons. Tony is not in the house sitting down five minutes without the Bible, Book of Mormon or Doc. And Cov. He is a splendid good boy. I am going to commence doing some work for our dead. I never began to realize about the redemption of the dead until I came here. 1 intend to do all I can to help forward the temple in my weak way. If I had money that is where I would put it. Give my love to all especially Richard, accept much for yourself from your loving Ma. St. George�March 77 My Dear Heber,. I received your welcome letter, but do not think of coming down on horseback this time of year. Tony said if you started, you would not get farther than Provo, I wouldn't have you attempt it. I would love very much to have you come, but not bad enough to have you come on horseback, besides it would cost you so much. Try and come with someone that is coming. I have been at the temple helping to celebrate Bro. Woodruff's 7oth birthday. There were upwards of 100 sisters went through the temple for his dead. Heber J. Grant was made president of the Tooele Stake in October 1880, before he was twenty-four years of age. Ina letter from St. George in 1881 the mother wrote to her son: St. George, Mar. 2, 1881 My Dear Heber, You speak of your being so good for nothing. You were very trying sometimes, and so are most children. I was too. I never forget my childhood days and the patience of my mother and her kind ways, and cousin J. W.�and the cross and scolding way his wife had. I feel different towards her now, and thankful, she learned me to work. I know my jolly way tried her Quaker way. I heard her tell cousin J. Once I was always singing. He replied "T love to hear her." After that I would go down in the garden and sing where | thought no one but my Heavenly Father would hear me�hymns my mother learned me. I sing them now sometimes in honor of her dear memory. I could always see Page 309 310 the good in you and nothing very bad. When Sister H. Would be so tried, I would say, "He will make a good man." She speaks of it many times since then when she would be so tried with N. And think I was too easy. I would say you thought the same of Heber, and he has made a good man. I always try to look at the good as well as the bad traits, and see which predominate. I see my own weak points and pray the Lord to show them to me, and help me to overcome them. On October 6, 1882, Heber J. Grant was called by revelation to be an apostle and he became a member of the Quorum of the Twelve just before his twenty-sixth birthday. In 1884, while her son was doing missionary work in Arizona with Brigham Young Jr., Rachel Grant commenced her letter as follows: Salt Lake City, Nov. 22, 1884 My Dear Heber: I thought I would write and wish you many happy returns of your birthday. That you may live long, be blessed with health and great wisdom, much of the Spirit of the Lord, and every other attribute that tends to ennoble and exalt men in this life and the next, is ever the wish and prayer of your Mother. A mother's justifiable pride in the achievements of her son, and interesting and valuable comments on her own philosophy of life are revealed in the letters which follow: Soda Springs, July 30, 85 My Dear Heber, The more good we can do for others the better we feel, whether it is appreciated or not. If we feel that we are pleasing our Heavenly Father that brings a good feeling. I think more of pleasing him than anyone else. I feel rewarded in this life for all I have passed through. To have you feel as you do and in the position you have been honored with. My daily prayer is that you may never do anything to dishonor your position. It was always my greatest desire that you might be useful in God's kingdom. It brings joy in this life and everlasting happiness in the life to come. I love a whole soul saint. March 1895 My Dear Heber: I often feel the Lord has blessed me more than I deserve when I think of his calling you to the position you occupy. It was my constant prayer before you were born, and after, that I might have a noble spirited child who would devote his life to the kingdom. May his choicest blessing attend you and yours is ever the wish of your devoted Mother. It is interesting to note that President Grant and his mother were members of the same ward for fifty years and they were very closely associated. During the time that President Grant was acting as president of the Japanese Mission, his mother wrote to him frequently and her letters were a source of comfort and inspiration. Copies of these letters are carefully bound in President Grant's letter books, showing how much he appreciated and loved the messages sent to him by his loving and faithful mother. Canine
