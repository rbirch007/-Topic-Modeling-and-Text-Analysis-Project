THE GROWING HOUSE
Erma Barney Busack
My neighbor had a little house That grew and grew and grew. It was so very small At first, it fitted only two.
Soon, another room was added When the children came; A porch and bedroom soon appeared. It didn't look the same.
And now I see they're building, The little house must grow, For the children are all married� Grandchildren, you know.
And, now, three generations find Within the house so small How grand that such a tiny house So much of love embraces! Notes to THE FIELDSubscription Price Raised to $1.50 as of July 1, 1947 NOTWITHSTANDING the loyalty of Relief Society women throughout the Church who have made possible the phenomenal increase in Magazine subscriptions which now total over 83,000, the General Board finds it necessary, as of July 1, 1947, to increase the annual subscription price from $1 to $1.50. This increase in subscription price has been made necessary because of steadily increasing paper, publishing, and circulation costs which have, for the past four years, been so high as to make it impossible for the Magazine to be selfsupporting. The only sources of income for the Magazine are subscriptions and advertising, which has been held to a minimum during and since the war years because of the acute paper shortage. The General Board regrets having to take this action since the subscription price of the official publication of the Society has been maintained at $1 per year since 1889. Every effort has been made to keep the Magazine self-supporting and to retain the $1 rate through a most careful watch over expenditures, and through editorial and other workers giving excessive hours of service. However, in spite of all that has been done, costs have advanced so much as to make an increase in price absolutely necessary. Magazine representatives are advised that all subscriptions sent to the General Board on or after July 1, 1947 are to be charged for at the increased rate of $1.50 per year. All subscriptions received at the General Board office which are post office dated on or before June 30, 1947 will require only the $1 rate. We wish to thank the many thousands of subscribers to the Magazine and the Magazine representatives who have served so faithfully and well, and we solicit their continued support for this Magazine of the women of the Church, for if the number of subscriptions should drop below the present circulation, it would be impossible, under existing conditions, to continue publication without financial loss, even at the increased subscription price of $1.50.
