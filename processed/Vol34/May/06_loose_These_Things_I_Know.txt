These things I know: That night will follow day, And bitter winter means a brighter May; That rain and sunshine lend a bud new life, And peace is sweeter after days of strife. This, too, I know: Love never really dies; Its memories are mirrored in the skies; And pain can cease its pulsing unawares. Above all this: God hears and answers prayers. Relief Society an Aid to Bishops President Belle S. Spafford [This talk was delivered at the request of meeting in the Tabernacle, Friday evening, E sincerely appreciate the opportunity afforded Relief Society of presenting to this great gathering of bishops, upon whom the Lord has placed the responsibility of caring for those in need, a few thoughts as to how Relief Society presidents may be. Of greater assistance to you in this important and sacred work. "The relief of the poor, the destitute, the widow, and the orphan, and the exercise of all benevolent purposes" was one of the primary objects of our Society as set forth by the Prophet Joseph Smith. In this, as in all phases of our program, we work under the direction and guidance of the Priesthood. Relief Society is vitally interested in the Church Welfare Program as it is being carried forward today, and it is anxious to do its part according to the desires and recommendations of the Priesthood authorities who preside over us. In fact, our success as an organization must, in large measure, be gauged by the quality of our contribution to the Welfare Program of the Church. Every member of our Society is afforded opportunity to contribute to the Program by giving sewing service or service on canning or food processing, harvesting, or other Welfare projects. Our Relief Society presidents hold a unique position. They have been termed by Elder Harold B. Lee "the bishop's right-hand Page 306 Bishop LeGrand Richards at the Bishops' April 4, 1947�Ed.] assistants" in his responsible calling of caring for those in need. As an aid to the bishop, it is our opinion that the most valuable contribution a Relief Society president can make is to visit, at his request, the home of each family %r ward member in distress, study its circumstances and needs and then make recommendations to the bishop, in private, as to the care of the family. This service is in harmony with recommendations to bishops in the Church Welfare Handbook of Instructions, which states: Any family reported to be in need should be visited immediately in order that an intelligent analysis may be made. Subsequent assistance should be based on this analysis. Responsibility for this visit and analysis rests with the bishop, but it is recommended that he call upon the ward Relief Society president to make this investigation. In making this analysis careful consideration should be given to all known factors, and recommendations should be made to the bishop for the care of the family, both as to meeting any immediate, urgent needs, and with respect to assisting the family in solving other problems with which it may be confronted. This is a logical assignment for Relief Society presidents since they are qualified by nature and experience for this type of work. Relief Society presidents are women of judgment and spiritual strength, otherwise as bishops you would not have called them to so responsible a position as that of a Relief Society president. They have sisterly, sympathetic insight into family problems. They are mothers and home-makers themselves. They under-stand the problems of homemaking and home management. They know what to look for in judging a family's situation. They are adroit in showing mothers how to get the most out of the means at their disposal. And this type of service is often much needed. In many homes where there is need, mothers do not know how to bake their own bread, remodel or make clothing; they do not know how to preserve fruits or can vegetables; neither do they know how to do their part in wisely managing any income the family may have. It is poor care of a family which fills its request for help without carefully studying its deep-seated needs and skillfully guiding and training it to-ward independence. TO thoroughly understand a family's situation, and to adequately plan for its present and future welfare requires time. Often many visits to a home are necessary to understand its situation and needs. Our interest in families should be a sustained interest. Relief Society presidents are, as a rule, freer to make these time-consuming visits than are bishops. So we feel ward Relief Society presidents are eminently qualified for this work. However, according to the 1946 Relief Society annual report, only very limited use is being made by bishops of Relief Society presidents in this capacity. The annual report reveals an average of only two family analyses per year per ward being made under the direction of the bishops. There were seven stakes reporting not one single analysis by a Relief Society president in any of their respective wards during the entire year. There were forty-two stakes reporting five or fewer visits throughout the entire stake during the year. The stake reporting the largest number showed an average of less than one visit per month per ward. We feel this is particularly unfortunate in t hat an unnecessary burden is placed upon bishops which ward Relief Society presidents are willing and qualified to carry. Not only this, but through bishops failing to so use Relief Society presidents, Relief Society is prevented from fulfilling instructions given it by Priesthood authorities which are basic in carrying out fundamental principles of the Welfare Program. In an address to Relief Society sisters at t he Relief Society general conference last October, Elder Harold B. Lee said: We are failing in this Welfare Program if and when we have mothers of homes receiving assistance who are able-bodied and can do so, when they are not brought into the production assignments, in sewing and breadmaking and rug weaving. You sisters must see to it that all able-bodied persons, whose home conditions permit them to do so, be brought in to help to be producers in that program from which they receive sustenance. We fail in that, and we fail in one of the prime requirements of the Welfare Program. Even though they may not be able to come to your centers, even though it may require someone being sent into their homes to teach them if they cannot come to a center, you presidents should see to it that someone teach-es them, and they have work to do in their own homes where they may have to be surrounded by their own children. In harmony with this advise we have instructed ward presidents that when a family is receiving assistance, 308 the mother should, if she is physically able, be brought into the production program. If, because of small children or for some other legitimate reason, she cannot leave her home to sew at the work meeting or to assist with the canning program, she should do some sewing at home, if only to make the clothing which she and her own family will use. If she doesn't know how to sew, Relief Society has a responsibility to teach her. Ifa sister needs a house dress, rather than to give her an order on the bishops' storehouse for a dress some other sister has made, it is far better and in line with Church teachings to provide material and allow or teach her to make the dress herself. This would reserve the house dress in the storehouse for a sister who is physically unable to make her own. If such a policy were followed, it would lessen the heavy sewing load being placed at the present time on members of the Society who are contributing such service in addition to performing their own arduous home duties. It would also encourage the sister in need to become more independent. How many beautiful baby layettes have been made and turned into our storehouses to be drawn out on bishops' orders! Every prospective mother has a right to the joy and development that comes from creating these tiny garments herself. Because so much love and happiness do accompany the making of these tiny articles, we have no right to deny a mother the opportunity to make her own. When we advise our Relief Society presidents to help those in need to make their own clothing, how often do we hear: "How can we do this, since the bishop does not call upon us to assist in making family analyses; we do not know the families for whom he is caring nor their respective needs? We cannot bring these mothers into the production program, neither can we assist them to wisely use the substance supplied by the bishop, as we do not know who they are." We feel that Relief Society could be of inestimably greater service to bishops and to the Program as a whole if our women were called into a regular weekly Welfare meeting where their vision would be enlarged and their understanding of their relationship to the bishops and the Welfare Program increased; where they might make regular reports and receive assignments, where they might be (as Brother Lee has expressed) "intelligent, inspired participants in the planning of the Welfare partnership." We do not wish to go beyond that which we are assigned, but we are sincerely anxious to fulfill the part that has been assigned to Relief Society under the Welfare Plan and to do all in our power to help the bishops and to forward this great and inspired work. May our Heavenly Father help us to this end I pray.
