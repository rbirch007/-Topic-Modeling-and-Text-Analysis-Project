TOLD AT SUNSET Grace Zenor Pratt If I might bring to skies that now are gray The sunset glow that charmed me late today, Put back the glowing crimson, saffron, blue and gold� Recapture that lost beauty, and could hold The spell of those last moments and the thrill When sunset kisses the last purple hill With glory; touches green valleys with its magic light... Then might I be content to endure one brief night. If I might hear again the cadence of your voice, Waking my soul to live and to rejoice; If I might lay my folded hands in silent prayer Upon your head and let them linger there, And see again the light love brought into your eyes� Those visions fair which meant our paradise; Then might I wait in patience, without tears, However long might be the empty years.

Sister Alberta O. Doxey, President, Eastern States Mission Relief Society, reports that the Pittsburgh Branch is one of the largest and most successfully conducted branches in the mission. Many of the members live a long distance from the church, and yet the attendance is excellent. An outstanding event is the annual Christmas bazaar in which the neighboring Societies are invited to participate. The women from the outlying districts travel thirty to forty miles to take part in the work of the bazaar. These visiting branches are Renfrew, Wilson, and Washington, Pennsylvania. BIG HORN STAKE (WYOMING), POWELL BRANCH VISITING TEACHERS' ACTIVITIES Grace E. Allphin, President, Big Horn Stake Relief Society, reports the overcoming of some of the difficulties of the visiting teachers' program by the Powell Branch: Our visiting teaching, during the years from 1942 through 1945, was done under quite a handicap in our branch of about thirty members. Because of war restrictions on gasoline and tires, many of the sisters were unable to carry on their visiting teaching. To visit one district of six members, we traveled fourteen miles, and would then double back and go on another district, which covered thirty-five miles, to visit seven members �traveling a total of forty-nine miles. For nearly two years, these districts were taken by Mary Helen Giles and Elizabeth Christensen. When the husband of Sister Giles was called into military service and Sister Giles left the branch, Bettina Graham took her place as a visiting teacher. Later, when cars were showing more wear, we alternated on our thirty-five mile district with Charlotte Walker and Elaine Schnabel, who had a town district. By each of the four teachers using her car alternately, we were able to continue our visiting. NOTES FROM THE FIELD 17 ' MEXICAN MISSION REUNION OF RELIEF SOCIETY MOTHERS AND DAUGHTERS Sister Mary D. Pierce, President, Mexican Mission Relief Societies, reports that during the general conference of the Mexican Mission May 24, 25, and 26, 1946, a special meeting of mothers and daughters was held, with more than four hundred in attendance. The talks emphasized the spiritual blessings enjoyed by the women of the Church and the teachings given to improve their temporal welfare. The highlight of the meeting was a talk by President George Albert Smith to the Relief Society women. He spoke of the duties and obligations of Latter-day Saint mothers in establishing a firm gospel foundation in the training of their children. In connection with the conference, a sewing exhibit was presented by the Relief Society. Included were articles from all parts of the mission, a total of 170 pieces. Typical Mexican handiwork; crocheting, knitting, drawn work, and cross-stitch designs decorated the tablecloths, runners, luncheon sets, napkins, pillowslips, aprons, handkerchiefs, and many other exquisitely made articles. Hot pads, quilts, and handkerchief bags were also exhibited. NORTHERN STATES MISSION CAMBRIDGE CITY BRANCH (INDIANA) REFERENCE LIBRARY Elna P. Haymond, President, Norther States Mission Relief Society, reports an interesting communication from Edith M. Dale of the Cambridge City Branch, regarding the establishment of a reference library: It was felt that the branch needed a proper library. Accordingly, a librarian was set apart by the branch president, and a library started. 'This library is now made up of approximately 250 books, including A Comprehensive History of the Church, and practically every book that has been published by the Church in the last few years. Every effort will be made by us to add those books that will be of help to our teachers. The books purchased by the Relief Society have been turned over to the branch library, which is supported by a regular budget allowance. We are proud of our library here and feel that it is perhaps as complete as any in the mission.  CENTRAL STATES MISSION, EL DORADO (ARKANSAS) BRANCH RELIEF SOCIETY MEMBERS ASSEMBLED FOR BREADMAKING DEMONSTRATION JUNE 18, 1946 This demonstration was held at the home of Lucille McClurg. A quilt was also completed at this meeting. Maude Flemiken is president of the El Dorado Relief Society and Alma Redick, who submitted the photograph, is secretary. Sister Martha W.

Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, May 6, 1947 Objective: To review in brief the ushering in of the last and greatest dispensation�the fulness of times. THE first hundred years of the Church, again established upon the earth, have marked the world with new light. Greater progress than has ever been known to man has come within the years since 1830. Blessings�material, intellectual, and spiritual, are here now for all God's children, Asa Church, we lay claim to all of these advancements because inspiration has come to all from him who knows all truth. We know that it is by no mere chance that so great have been the strides in science, education, and culture for all living. Did not the Lord himself promise a restoration of all things, when he spoke the words recorded in the Old Testament, "I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh" (Joel 2:28)? Before we consider some of the important events studied during our Church history course these past three years, let us, in part at least, look at the material gains that are now a part of everyday living, which were unthought of in 1830. Standards of living today have made a phenomenal advancement during the past century. The writer remembers but a few years ago an Page 124 experience at the New York World's Fair. In the electrical building, the designers of that exhibit had re-created a street of the nineties. Shops and stores, boardwalks and a cobble road, first met the eye. Then, there were unsightly telephone poles with their glass insulators. Dim lights cast a yellow glow from the high crossbars, and from the store windows. One fairly groped along the street. And this was a representation of the new electrical age, a great advance over the candle and firelight period of the 1830's! One walked along this world of yesterday to turn the corner into today's avenue of light. It was like walking from night into day. A modem boulevard with brilliant lights greeted each visitor who gazed into up-to-date store windows. Everywhere there was brightness and life. What a contrast, and in such sharp relief, the old and the new in immediate relation to one another! Somehow, we have slipped gradually into our modern world, and in so doing, have forgotten how great the change has been. According to LESSON DEPARTMENT one authority, the advance in the richness of personal life, so far as material conveniences are concerned, has risen one thousand per cent. In the field of medicine and surgery, within the past one hundred years, three of the greatest discoveries of all time have been made: anaesthesia; the germ theory of disease; and antisepsis. These have assuaged suffering and prolonged life. One but needs to dwell for a moment on the thought of the atomic age into which the recent world war has plunged us. Truly, if ever, Christ's greatest tenet�"Love one another" must now become the greatest of forces in human life if we, as a world of human beings, are to live together. Yes, God has poured out his spirit upon all flesh, but one wonders if this, the beginning of all good gifts, can find a place in a world where God also has given man his free agency. And what are the claims of the Church in this age of wonders? We say that all great discoveries have come because God has willed them. He is the author of all truth, his is the spirit that lightens every man that comes into the world. These things have come to mankind as but another manifestation of the Lord's will to bless his children, and with their coming, too, he has fulfilled the greater promise�that of restoring the gospel of the Redeemer. Such was the mission of the first vision of the Father, in company with the Son, to Joseph Smith. The words, "This is my beloved son, hear him," have rung through these hundred years, and the world has heard him as never before, in evidence of which, we of the Church of Jesus 125 Christ, point to the marvelous advancement of this age. Assuredly� The morning breaks, the shadows flee; Lo! Zion's standard is unfurled. The dawning of a brighter day Majestic rises on the world. The clouds of error disappear Before the rays of true divine; The glory bursting from afar Wide o'er the nations soon will shine. And now, to touch again the high lights of the century past, in so far as its narrative is connected with the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Church that came again with the divine mission to elevate, to build up, to regenerate. It has taught again the ageless truths of man's correct relationship to his Creator, his true purpose in life, and the way he should go if he is to gain ultimate exaltation in his Father's kingdom. Four things stand out: a vision; a new witness; authority; and Christ's Church. Upon these cornerstones, now rests the firm foundation of God's modern work and a wonder. The First Vision of the Father and the Son Joseph Smith was the instrument, and 1820 was the year. God began then, for the last time, his work of the fulness of salvation among men. And, through the efforts of this humble boy, the world has come, as of old, to know of eternal life. Small wonder that Joseph never forgot that he had "seen a light, and in the midst of that light... Two Personages," and they did, in reality, speak to him. And though he was to be persecuted all the days of his life for so declaring, yet he knew, and dared not deny, neither would deny, that he had seen a vision. As he walked in the fresh spring air down the lane that Jed from the grove�a Sacred Grove now�his Lord, a living Savior, who called him by name, had left in his soul the music of an eternal voice. Did Joseph ever forget that voice? Never! And that voice, though it came like the rushing of a mighty wind, or with the still, quiet assurance of a loving father, was ever known to Joseph. And Joseph, like the chosen disciples of old, with ear attuned, ever listened to its solemn counsel. Through Joseph Smith, the world today has the words of that voice, uttered for our times, "pregnant with wisdom and purpose, throwing a flood of light upon the gospel." Blessed is he that reads and keeps these words, which may be found in the book of the Doctrine and Covenants. A New Witness for Christ� The Book of Mormon Within this Book of Mormon, is recorded the fulness of the gospel, once again, for the world�the Savior's gospel, with its sweet and precious truths to enlighten the mind and quicken the hearts of all who hunger after righteousness. For God has said that in the mouths of two, or more witnesses shall all truth be established. Now, the world has another record to tell of Christ's -message�in addition to the Bible. Authority From on High� John the Baptist and the Holy Priesthood It was the 15th of May, 1820. There, in the brightness of the warm spring sunbeams that streamed down through the trees, two young men knelt, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, and spoke their wishes to God. Presently, in a cloud of light that exceeded the brilliance of that beautiful day, there stood beside them a heavenly messenger. Placing his hands upon their bowed heads, he spoke: Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah I confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; and this shall never be taken again from the earth, until the sons of Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness (Doc. And Cov. Sec. 13). The Church of Jesus Christ Again Organized In the month of April, and in the year 1830, the following revelation came through Joseph the Prophet: The rise of the Church of Christ in these last days, being one thousand eight hundred and thirty years since the coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in the flesh, it being regularly organized and established agreeable to the laws of our country, by the will and commandments of God, in the fourth month, and on the sixth day of the month which is called April�Which commandments were given to Joseph Smith, Jun., who was called of God, and ordained an apostle of Jesus Christ, to be the first elder of this Church... And this according to the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, to whom be all glory, both now and forever. Amen (Doc. And Cov. 20: 1, 2, 4). What are the future years and the blessings for the children of men? Time alone can tell, but of this we may be sure, God has said that heaven and earth shall pass away, but that his word shall not pass away. It is upon his word that we rely. That word promises a great day! To speed its arrival, his Church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, with all its blessings for  LESSON DEPARTMENT mankind, is here�and here to stay (Dan. 2:44). Its mission is clear, its destiny glorious. God be praised! Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion At the conclusion of any long period of work and study, one often feels like singing. Certainly, in the Songs of Zion, one may find excellent voicing of the glories of the restored gospel. Spend this discussion period studying, and singing, if you like, the words of these songs that best express the restoration of the fulness of times. Here are a few suggestions in the form of song titles: 127 "The Morning Breaks, the Shadows Flee" "An Angel from on High" "Praise to the Man" "For the Strength of the Hills" "The Spirit of God Like a Fire" "In Our Lovely Deseret"' "Zion Stands with Hills Surrounded" "Our Mountain Home So Dear" "Now Let Us Rejoice" "The Day Dawn is Breaking" "O Ye Mountains High" "One Hundred Years" Have each class member come prepared to read and comment on a favorite passage of scripture from the Doctrine and Covenants. Visiting Teachers' Messages�Our Pioneer Heritage Lesson 8�Thirst for Knowledge President Amy Brown Lyman For Tuesday, May 6, 1947 Objective: To inspire an appreciation in us of the pioneer thirst for knowledge, that urge to progress, that search for ultimate perfection. HEN Joseph Smith made the statements: "The glory of God is intelligence" and "A man is saved no faster than he gains knowledge," he set up high ideals for education in the Church. In a recent report by the director of economic and business research of the University of Utah, we learn that Utah today leads the United States in education per capita. This is not only a tribute to the State itself, but is also a tribute to the founders of the State, who opened a day school three months after their arrival in the Valley in 1847, and established a university three years later. Going back to the early days of the Church, we find that the "School of the Prophets" was established in Kirtland, and the "School of Elders" in Nauvoo, for spiritual culture, and that other schools, including the University of Nauvoo, were established for secular education. And, after leaving Nauvoo, schools were conducted by the Latter-day Saints in the several temporary settlements on the way to Utah. Emmeline B. Wells taught such a school at Winter Quarters in 1846-47. Even on the plains, the emigrants taught their children to read, write, and spell. After the arrival in the Valley, and while the pioneers were clearing their land, planting crops, and building homes, they found time to provide for the education of their children by establishing schools. In fact, one of the first activities in every community was the building of a meeting house and the establishment of a school. The first school was taught by a woman�Mary Jane Dilworth. (It is interesting to note that a schoolhouse in Salt Lake City is to be erected and given the name "Mary Jane Dilworth.") Art culture in Utah also had its foundation in early pioneer days. Music and the drama played an important part in the amusements and the recreation of the people. Painting and sculpture were also fostered. On the plains, music, singing, and dancing gave relief from the care and worry of the long, tiresome trip. Pitt's Brass Band cheered the travelers on their journey from Nauvoo to, and beyond, the Missouri River. Many musical instruments had been tucked away in the wagons for use Jater. For serious moments, faith promoting hymns such as, "Come, Come, Ye Saints," were sung by the campfires at the day's end. These activities gave great succor and support, comfort and cheer. The music was both serious and gay. The great organ, built in the Tabernacle in the 60s, made possible a culture in music that could not have existed without it. Then there was organized a splendid orchestra which furnished music of high classic and cultural quality. Only five years after the advent into the Valley, construction of the little theater known as Social Hall, was begun. It was dedicated the following year. Later, the Salt Lake Theater was built. It was opened to the public in March 1862. In both of these houses, high-class drama was presented. Soon, dramatic entertainments were also given in most of the other communities. There seemed to be an inborn culture in the pioneers of Utah, and their descendants have inherited their idealism, which has resulted in unusually high standards in education, music, the drama, printing, sculpture, and literature. And, very naturally, the State has produced a proportionately large number of outstanding educators, musicians, actors, painters, sculptors, and writers. Work Meeting�Sewing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting) Lesson 7�Fashion Show Work Meeting Committee, Velma N. Simonsen, Chairman For Tuesday, May 13, 1947 SUCCESS is to achieve that which we set out to do. Therefore, we hope that you who have participated in the sewing program have had a most successful year. We hope many of you sisters have discovered that good dressmaking is merely a matter of "know how," and that there is no special talent, no mysterious gift, nor special ability required to be able to sew well. We hope you have found that all that is needed is good common sense, careful attention to small details, and a thorough understanding of the steps which must be followed to achieve the desired results�a perfect garment.
Nothing succeeds like success. So do have a fashion show to exhibit your work, and to let others share in the joy of your achievements. A display of other work-day accomplishments, including articles made for the welfare assignment, might also be exhibited at the same time. This could be given as part of your Relief Society Birthday program, or at your closing social. Let as many as possible see your accomplishments and catch your enthusiasm, that next year we may have many more participants in our sewing program.
Literature�America as Revealed in Its Literature
Lesson 8�America, Land of All Nations
Elder Howard R. Driggs
For Tuesday, May 20, 1947
Our Father's Gift Proclaims� The centuries fall like grains of sand, We meet to-day, united, free, And loyal to our land and Thee, To thank Thee for the sea thus, And trust Thee for the opening one.
THESE are lines from Whittier's "Centennial Hymn," written in commemoration of the hundredth birthday of our Declaration of Independence. Our nation had come to the close of this first century of freedom with its Constitution strengthened, the Union preserved; treble the number of the first thirteen stars in its flag; and its frontier advanced "from sea to shining sea." Folk from every clime were seeking in a homeland of greater freedom, of expanded opportunity.
Following the testing days of the Civil War, our population increased by leaps and bounds. America became, in very deed, a land of all nations. Each group of the thronging millions of newcomers naturally sought out the regions within the free domain where they best might
thrive, and gave themselves to the development of the land, or to trade and industry and commerce.
This was brought home to the writer at one time while traveling through Wisconsin. For miles and miles along the route, he observed well-kept dairy farms and herds of milch cows.
"How did your State get such a start in the dairy business?" he asked.
"Well, the Swiss settled this section," a native of Wisconsin replied. "These folk had learned on the slopes of the Alps how to raise purebred cattle and they found here opportunity to expand the rich industry."
Another stretch was plodding through woodlands and passing sawmill after sawmill. In response to a like question as to that development, the fact was brought out that it was Norwegians who had come to the timber belt, and had, with their skill at Jumber-making, produced the materials that transformed the sod houses of the settlers into neat, frame cottages. To this informative experience was added another of similar import. In Scranton, Pennsylvania, heart of the anthracite coal region, it was revealed that miners from Wales had first developed that great industry. One other illuminating pleasure came during a visit there with the attending of a gathering of Welsh folk at a park. This occasion was not only a picnic, but a feast of song, story, and poetry�all in the spirit of the days of the bards and King Arthur. These good people had come to America, like other groups, not only with manual skills, but with their native music, literature, and other means of recreation. America had opened opportunities for a richer, more abundant life; they, in turn, had helped to develop and enrich our country, not alone in a material sense, but in an artistic and cultural sense as well. To appreciate this truth is to understand better the broader sources of the strength and character of the American people. Tolerance�one of the cardinal virtues�is cultivated as one looks for the best in folk. A first tendency in dealing with those of foreign birth is to think of their outward peculiarities�perhaps to smile at them. 'Time often reveals that, at heart, folk of every clime are more alike than different. To appreciate the good in folk, is generally to bring it out of them. Literature, of the sincere, appreciative kind, opens our eyes to the lives and hearts of those portrayed. To understand those of foreign cast among us, we should turn first to the literature�the songs and stories�they brought from the old homeland; second, to their own literary expression inspired by their contacts with the new land. In the � third place, there is the literature which comes from American writers who portray folk of different types in their interesting speech and reactions to our land of freedom. So far as this last named kind of literature is concerned, it is only fair to say that it is still in the making. Our portrayals of folk from foreign strands in story, drama, song, and other types of expression, in some cases, rise to artistry. Generally speaking, however, it is clever, rather than classic�mainly creations in the varied dialects or brogues, aimed at stirring laughter. Occasionally, one gets through the lines soulful touches. Following are a few examples of such: W'en I am com' from Eeatly, Jus' landa from da sheep, Som' thief he tak' my mon' from me An' - presto! - he is skeep.

Milt Gross has also given us similar presentations in Jewish dialect. All these creations may afford some harmless pleasure when well read; but they are not literature that portrays the inner souls of the varied folk who have made America their homeland. One gets closer to the thoughts and lives of these people through more searching expression. Here is one story which came from one of the writer's students in New York University. It may serve to lift some of the struggle of foreign folk, who finally won their way to America, more vibrantly before us. "My mother," said this girl, "lived in Russia during the reign of the Czar. She was a widow with three children. I was one of them. Though I was too young to realize her hardships, I did get some feel of the struggle. "Her dream, as we learned later, was to come to America with us. To make this a reality, she planned and worked. It would take money. We had scarcely enough to keep the wolf from the door. Yet once in a while she did get a coin she felt must be spared. "Her bank was a bag hidden in a pothole of our corral. Out she would steal to this in the dead of night and lift the post set loosely in the hole. Then, 'opening the bag, drop the coin into it, and return to the house. For several years, she persisted in this money saving. "Finally, came her golden opportunity .... Mother, seizing her chance, lifted her precious store, and brought us all to this land of freedom. What a priceless heritage that dear soul, now passed away, has bequeathed to me." Perhaps a million stories of similar import and spirit might be related by other freedom-seeking folk who finally made this their homeland. Dr. Edward Alfred Steiner used to tell teachers in their institutes, of his struggle as a boy to get to this country, and of the testing days after his arrival as a lone lad of foreign tongue getting started here. One first bit of advice freely given him at the outset was, "Remember, young man, in this country, God helps those who help themselves." He had come, he said, to a free country; yet, after the first day, with every cent of his money gone, he found that the only free thing he could get was ice water. In her America and I, another im-migrant, Anzia Yezierska, pictures vividly her beginning struggles in America. She had come with rosy dreams of quick wealth, of opportunities for expressing her soul in a free country. Sadly, she soon found herself disillusioned. Forced to work to keep from starving, she finally took the only job she could find, one of "sweatshop" type, sewing black buttons on shirts. It was a cruel crashing of her high hopes. One day, in desperation, she went to a settlement house for advice. Received rather coldly there, she gave vent to her pent-up feelings. Finally, the attendant, after listening to her plea for something better than the soul-searing work she was doing, said, "What do you want?" "T want America to want me," was her passionate reply. "You will have to show that you have something special for America, before America has need of you," came the reply. After another burst of pent-up emotion and appeal from this immigrant girl, the attendant said, "America is no Utopia. First, you must become proficient in earning a living before you can indulge in your poetic dreams." Anzia says she went out of that office with the light out of her eyes, and her feet dragging like dead wood. She had not made herself understood. Something about America was different. What was that difference? "I began to read American history," she continues. "I found from the first pages that America started with a band of Pilgrims. They had left their native country, as I had left mine. They had crossed an unknown ocean and landed in an unknown country as I. "But the great difference between the first Pilgrims and me was that they expected 'to make America, build America, create their own world of liberty. I wanted to find it ready made." This re-discovery of America by an earnest girl of foreign birth became the beginning of her future success. It fs something that every new American, and those who claim a richer heritage by reason of forebears that go back to Pilgrim Revolutionary heroes must learn and keep learning to hold their Americanism true and safe. Our land of liberty is not ready made for any one of us; it is a land of opportunity of service, of freedom, for those willing to work or fight, if need be, for that boon. Something deeper than mere material aspects explains the thronging of folk from many lands to our shores. What is it? Here is a simple answer from a fifth grade school boy. The writer had asked of a class, "Why are you glad you live in America?" Varied replies came from the eager youngsters. Finally, this lad said, "J am glad I live in America, because in America it is not where you come from, it's you." Everyone, even a child, wants to feel the spirit of fair play, of equality of opportunity; and that is just what the country affords for all who come with honest purpose seeking its privileges. If one poem more than another, from a foreign strand, voices the true heart of America, it is "A Man's a Man for a' That" by Robert Burns. Following are stanzas from that classic. It was written, so it is said, when this gifted poet, after entertaining some of the Scottish nobility, had been sent to eat with the servants. Burns passed back his feelings over such aristocratic treatment through a poem that has rung round the world:  LESSON DEPARTMENT Is there for honest Poverty That hings his head, and a' that; The coward slave � we pass him by, We dare be poor for a' that! For a' that, and a' that. Our toils obscure an' a' that, The rank is but the guinea's stamp, The Man's the gowd for a' that. What though on hamely fare we dine, Wear hoddi n grey,an 'a'that; Gie fools their silks and knavesvtheir wine; A Man's a Man for a' that: For a' that, and a' that, Their tinsel show, an' a' that; The honest man, tho' e'er sae poor, Is king o' men for a ' that. Then let us pray that come it may, (As come it will for a' that,) That Sense and Worth, o'er a' the earth, Shall bear the green, an' a' that. For a' that, and a' that, It's coming yet for a' that, That Man to Man, the world o'er, Shall brothers be for a' that. An outstanding literary creation, whose name has become classic, is The Melting Pot, a stirring drama by Israel Zangwill. Its hero, David, an immigrant youth, who has escaped from Old World tyranny, finally reaches America, and as he looks upon New York, with its im-pressive skyline and the Statue of Liberty, exclaims: There she lies, the great Melting-Pot � listen! Can't you hear the roaring and bubbling? There gapes her mouth � the harbor where a thousand mammoth feeders come from the ends of the world to pour in their human freight. Ah, what a stirring and a seething! Celt and Latin, Slav and Teuton, Greek and Syrian, � black and yellow � Jew and Gentile � Yes, East and West, North and South, the palm and the pine, the pole and the equator, the crescent and the cross � how the great Alchemist melts and fuses them with his purging flame! Here shall they all unite to build the Republic of Man and the Kingdom of God. Ah, what is the glory of Rome and Jerusalem where all nations and races come to worship and look back, compared to the glory of America, where all races and nations come to labor and look forward! Yes, America is truly a "melting pot"� yet one of her most serious problems is, and ever has been, to make the melting most successful. How can the melting, the fusing, the refining process best be promoted? An experience of the writer, in boyhood, provides an analogy that may point helpfully to the answer. During his youthful years, he was reared near the old Jordan smelter; and often, with other young play-mates, would watch, with eager interest, the magical process of extracting the precious metals from the ore. There it was, in varicolored piles from the mines of Bingham, Alta, Park City, Eureka, and other nearby camps. Workers would cart this ore to the "melting pot" or huge retort. Then they would shovel into this receptacle some of it; and add a lay-er of limestone, then more ore, and more limestone. When the "melting pot" was about filled, the fire beneath it would be set roaring. Finally came the tapping of the pot, and lo! the molten stream would pour out of its spout, to fall into in-verted conical, iron kettles on wheels. These would be drawn to the edge of the great slag dump and there allowed to remain until the melted ore had cooled. A next step was to upturn the kettles, and out would fall what looked like big chocolate drops. Along a workman would come and, with his sledge hammer, give each of these a crack, and knock off its tip. That ingot contained the gold, silver, or  other valuable metal which had sunk to the bottom of the conical kettle when the melting took place. Upturned, it formed the tip of the cone. "What had the limestone to do wit h the process?" someone may ask. That was added to promote the fusing or melting of the ore. It helped to bring out the precious metals. This fact we youngsters learned afterwards in school. Right here is the main point of our analogy. To get the best out of folk of different origins� particularly to bring them into more cooperative working relationship, there must be something to promote the fusion of their natures. This may be found in a common language, in literature of common appeal, in mu-sic, art, and education in a general sense. Most vital, however, of all the fusing elements is true religion. In the story of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is striking and abundant proof of the beneficent effects of the gospel in promoting brotherhood, unity, concerted action for the common good. Our people, gathered from many lands, have come through testing hardships to our land of Zion, and, under the fusing influence of the gospel, performed a mighty work and a wonder in making "the desert blossom as a rose"� but more vital still in redeeming souls and leading hon-est, God-fearing folk along the path of righteousness. Now the golden, the challenging opportunity to share with all the world the glories of the restored gospel has come. Our America� Land of All Nations� has the position of leadership in the mighty development. As a people, the Latter-day Saints have had a foundational training for the great work of guiding and inspiring folk of every clime towards freedom along the way of truth and goodness. Our prayer is that we shall play the role with true faith, courage and understanding in the great drama that lies ahead. Discussion and Activities i.

'There are perhaps two fundamental concepts that have contributed to this condition. The first is the conception that the ultimate salvation and exaltation of an individual will depend, to a great extent, upon his knowledge and. Intelligence. Believing, as we do, that the ultimate goal of eternal life is the attainment of a degree of Godhood, it is logical to draw the conclusion that such a position can be achieved only when the individual is sufficiently advanced in understanding to assume such a position with its powers and possibilities. The statement so often repeated, "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth" (Doc. And Cov. 93:36), stimulated the Latter-day Saints to become interested in education. Some years later the Lord revealed: Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection. And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come (Doc. And Cov. 130:18-19). The thought expressed in this quotation became a powerful incentive to study, learn and observe, in order to enter the next life with as much intellectual understanding as possible, thereby having an advantage over dilatory ones who failed to acquire knowledge during mortality: Another idea that influenced the Church to interest itself in education arose from the nature of the organization of the Church. Unlike most other churches, we have neither professional nor trained clergymen. It is what is referred to as a "Jay-leadership church," meaning that the laity, or members of the Church, assume the responsibility for its leadership. In order to provide effective leadership, with ability to speak properly, write correctly and effectively, interpret the relationship of religion to life, and understand the nature of social trends, the Church needed to provide for the intellectual and cultural growth of all of its members. Furthermore, the nature of our "lay-missionary" system, in which each Church member is a potential missionary, demanded that the standard of education within the Church be high. An organized school effort within the Church was undertaken at Kirtland, Ohio, and is known as the "School of the Prophets." It was to be primarily a leadership training school for the adult members of the Church, to prepare them for their responsibilities as Church leaders and missionaries. The following instructions, taken from revelations dated December 27, 1832, and March 8, 1833, were directed to these early Church leaders: Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand; Of things both in heaven and in the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms... Seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith... And set in order the churches, and stud and learn, and become acquainted with a good books, and with languages, tongues, and people (Doc. And Cov. 88:78-79; 118; go:15). An analysis of the foregoing quotations will indicate that the saints were to study things that we today know as astronomy, geology, ancient, modern, and current history, domestic and foreign affairs, international relations, geography, politics, ethnology, archaeology and foreign languages. The brethren took these instructions seriously and, while engaged in earning their daily bread, found time to improve their minds, and even undertook the study of the Hebrew language in order to better understand the message of the Old Testament, and planned to learn Greek for use in the study of the New Testament. At Nauvoo, they incorporated into their charter the tight to establish a municipal university�the first in the United States. The pioneer groups brought with them to the West books and maps, which were used in the elementary schools of that day. As Latter-day Saint groups were organized and sent out to colonize the various valleys of the West, it was always arranged that a teacher or two would be included in the personnel that was to settle the new community. Throughout the districts where Latter-day Saints predominate, the Church Board of Education, during the last quarter of the nineteenth century, established academies, that were, in reality, the forerunners of the modern high schools. As the various state departments of education entered the field of secondary or high school education, the Church withdrew from it, and pioneered the junior college field. Gradually, as the states took over the junior college level of education, the Church withdrew from this field. Today, only the Ricks College at Rexburg and the Juarez Academy in Mexico remain of this once extensive system. 'The Church pioneered in fields where the states were not functioning, in order to  LESSON DEPARTMENT provide its members with advantages for education and training for Church leadership. When _ the Church withdrew from the high school and junior college fields of education, it pioneered a new type of religious education, namely, the seminary and institute of religion designed to supplement public education with religious education.
