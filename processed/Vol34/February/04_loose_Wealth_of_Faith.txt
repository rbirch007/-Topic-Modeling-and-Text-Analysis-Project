WEALTH OF FAITH Eva Willes Wangsgaard So short a span we've come from poverty! A poverty which had no way to turn, Except to patience, faith, and being free _ To fight the desert's old, persistent burn. Not long ago, men shared a dwindling store; As neighbors, starved and struggled side by side; Created pleasures, lessening what they bore; And Eden bloomed again before they died. They lived with life too earnestly to fret; They were too near their God to feel afraid, Too grateful for their freedom to regret The price in work and suffering they paid; They lived, and faith enriched the fields they trod? Faith in themselves, the constant earth, and God.
