Magazine Promotion Ida Isaacson Counselor, Wells Stake Relief Society, Salt Lake City [Address Delivered at Magazine Section, Relief Society General Conference, October 2, 1946.] E, in Wells Stake, have tried to promote the Magazine in three ways: 1. By the use of visual aids, posters, slogans, booklets, etc. 2. By ward check ups on Relief Society memberships and Magazine subscriptions. 3. By holding two well-planned Magazine meetings during the summer in our homes. On June 13, the Magazine representatives and educational counselors came to the first meeting with a fairly accurate check up on the women in their wards. They had written down on slips of paper: 1. The number of Relief Society members in their wards. 2. The number of Relief Society members taking the Magazine. 3. The number of Latter-day Saint women in their wards. On July 8, we. Held a second meeting for Magazine representatives only. And each was given a chart to fill out and return by September 1, which they did. The detailed chart had eight questions to be answered by the Magazine representative: 1. Number of Relief Society members in your ward? 2. Number of Relief Society members taking the Magazine? 3. Number of Latter-day Saint women in your ward? Number of subscriptions going outside the ward? Number of subscriptions coming into the ward from other wards? Number of non-members taking the Magazine? PS Ss 7. Number of Magazines sent as gifts in your own ward? 8. Number of Relief Society working mothers? This chart is proving to be an index to us of the women in Wells Stake. It shows that we have: 772 Relief Society members in Wells Stake 666 Magazine subscriptions 1592 Latter-day Saint women The chart tells us that 106 of our Relief Society members are not represented by the Magazine, and further indicates that over half of our women are not members of the Society, or 820 are not members of the Society, and not represented by the Magazine. We found forty-one non-members were taking the Magazine, and thirty-seven Magazines were being sent out of the stake. When the chart is completely finished, it will tell us more. It will tell us how many Magazines are being sent as personal gifts to members in the ward by members of the ward. And here, we believe, is a fertile field to work in. We can do something about these 820 women who are not Relief Society minded. Many of these women know very little about the Society or its work. As a friend, a neighbor, a relative, a visiting teacher, we can give the Magazine to these homes. Each of us presenting a Magazine in one of these homes would produce a real showing. The chart reveals a great deal of Page 549 550 fine work on the part of the Magazine representatives and educational counselors. For instance, one new ward has a membership of 101, and a Magazine subscription count of ninety-six. This Magazine representative is sixty-seven years of age, but she has had splendid help from her husband, who writes out all of her reports and takes them to the office. In fact, all of the husbands of Magazine representatives in Wells Stake have co-operated splendidly. And we do thank them. One Magazine representative has a notebook, with the names and addresses of every Latter-day Saint woman in her ward, and needless to say, she knows her women. But, as she says, "I want to know them better." She doesn't have good health, but she uses the telephone, and also talks with her women wherever she meets them. Her achievement is one of the best, and her well-planned record is taking good care of the women in her ward. In two new wards, the visiting teachers and presidencies have made calls on all Latter-day Saint women. This strengthens the cause of the Magazine, because it arouses enthusiasm among the women. There are endless ways to attract attention to the Magazine the use of visual aids, the telephone, personal calls, casual meetings; but, more than anything else, is a careful check up of our women and a consistent following through, until, by our interviews, we have placed the Magazine in all our Latter-day Saint homes, Early this spring we recognized the value of visual aids. At a visiting teachers' convention each Magazine representative and educational counselor, working together, made a poster. We have placed these posters in our Relief Society rooms this summer, and this fall we will make new ones. Also, at this convention, we gave each woman a little book, in which about ten women had. Stated their personal opinions of the Magazine. Over 200 women attended the convention. I might add that another exemplary way to attract attention to the Magazine is for mothers and grandmothers to occasionally have their daughters, or their nieces, read to them some bit from the Magazine. It would have a lasting influence, I shall welcome the day when Junior and Gleaner Girls will be introduced to Theby their mothers. Our goal in Wells Stake is to make the way a happy way for the receiving of the Magazine. We still have far to go, but we are getting a great pleasure out of promoting the Magazine. Oo
