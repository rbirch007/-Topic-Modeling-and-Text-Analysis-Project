THE PLACE" Lizabeth Wall They stood for a long time, watching and wondering, These strange, proud people in a strange, new land, These gentle, kindly people, plodding and pondering, Men and women, weary, waiting, hand in hand. (The heat waves shimmered On the valley floor, And a lake shone silver On a far, gold shore . . . . ) They stood for a long time. Here was the ending, Here the beginning of a hard-fought dream; And the valley held them in a subtle blending Of sagebrush and aspen and wind-song and stream. (The heat waves shimmered And a city grew Up from the desert And into the blue . . . .) Under their feet were the hot sands, sifting, And over their heads were the wild, bright skies, But they saw a white city with tall spires lifting, And they walked toward it, singing, with glory in their eyes! Page 525 Pioneer Stories and Incidents OXEN ON THE PLAINS President Amy Brown Lyman [This is the eleventh and final story in a series of true pioneer incidents published by Thein honor of the 1947 Utah Centennial celebration.  Ed. ] In any consideration of the conquest and settlement of the West, the part played by oxen symbol of pioneer transportation  should not be overlooked. And in paying tribute to the stalwart men and women who took part in this great adventure, tribute should be paid, also, to the gentle, faithful oxen, which contributed so much to the success of the undertaking. The pioneers and pathfinders of early days fully appreciated the value of oxen, and gave these animals full credit for the great contribution they made in the winning of the West. Through early experience, the plainsmen learned that, for all general purposes, oxen were much better fitted for the rough travel of the plains than horses better fitted for pulling heavy loads through mud and sand, and for fording streams, and for clearing and breaking up the vast stretches of virgin prairie land. Other advantages were that oxen could be purchased cheaper than horses and could be cared for at less expense, their food consisting chiefly of grass, either green or dried, while horses and mules had to be grain-fed en route; that oxen required no harnesses. Merely wooden yokes; and, in addition, that   their flesh in emergency or shortage could be used for food. Then, again, oxen could not be run off by the Indians at night as easily as could horses. Pioneer John Brown, who served as emigration agent for the Church for a number of years, and who recruited and trained hundreds of oxen, was typical of those who appreciated the faithful, obedient, and willing oxen. He seemed to understand them and to have real affection for them. He always insisted that in breaking oxen to the yoke, great care should be taken that they be not broken in spirit, also. He used to tell how, on many occasions when driving oxen and sleeping in the open, drivers would lie down beside their oxen and snuggle up to their backs to keep warm. In his journal, written during the summer of 1862, he tells of his experience as one of the Church agents in helping to prepare companies for the journey across the plains. He first went to Chicago and purchased wagons for the trip, then had them shipped to Florence. Nebraska, which was the outfitting place. He then spent several months recruiting 144 yoke of oxen in Illinois, Missouri, and Towa, and driving them to Florence, where they were trained, or broken to the yoke. Among his business entries is the following, which gives an idea of PIONEER STORIES AND INCIDENTS the prices paid for oxen and of the average age of the oxen: Council Bluffs, May 29, 1862. Sold to John Brown, 1 yoke of oxen, 4 years old, one white and red spotted; the other red with a white spot on a shoulder and a spot on the loin, for $50.00. Received payment. Signed, I. H. Tooleman. In one day when eight purchases of oxen were made, the average price paid was $62 per yoke and the aver age age was five and one-half years. It appears that oxen were at their best between the ages of four and seven years, inclusive, and that their usefulness was little more than fourteen years. Mrs. Matilda Stewart Park, widow of John M. Park, mother of nine children, lived: neat Council Bluffs with her family. In the spring of 1852, she decided to come to Utah, if possible. She had only an old wagon, but she purchased a yoke of oxen, secured the necessary supplies, 527 and came with the Charles C. Rich company. During the long and tedious journey, one of her faithful and much beloved oxen gave out entirely and had to be left behind, which was a great disappointment and sorrow to her, for she needed the ox and, besides, had real affection for him. However, she completed the journey and located in Provo City. One day sometime after her arrival, as she looked out her window, she saw some travelers passing by and recognized her ox in one of the teams. She rushed out and identified the ox, but, of course, she did not even suggest taking it away from the teamster, who said he felt sure that she was telling the truth. He told her he would like to use the ox until he reached his home, which was in Payson, and that he would then fatten it up for beef and bring her half of the meat. This, he did, and so she was supplied with meat for the winter. Drawing by Evan Jensen
