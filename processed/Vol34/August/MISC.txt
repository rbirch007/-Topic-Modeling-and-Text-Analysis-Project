Dorothy J. Roberts What quiet understanding lies Behind those calm and kindly eyes; What secrets safe within that breast Beneath her words that heal and What treasures through her mind have passed, Unwritten tales her heart holds fast. From every house some noble strain Rings through the years, a blessed refrain; What drama and what tragedy She shares in silence, willingly; What education of the heart That, later, springs of wisdom start. Where flames have pillaged, none are cold; Her hand-stitched comforters enfold The destitute. Her palm has eased The mother who is terror-seized Before the childbirth mystery; * What title may her service rate, Who holds no college doctorate; What power, that these homes revere And hold her briefest visit dear. The Cover: "The Teachers Go Calling," Photograph by Willard Luce. The models are Loleta Dixon and Lois McEwan of Provo, Utah.
