CENTENNIAL RETURN Andrew M. Andersen I seemed to see him standing there Upon the spot where once he said, "This Is the Place," Looking toward the city that he loved. Sharp lines of buildings cut into the sky Where planes flew confident At speeds that he had never known; And factories toiled, Pouring out incalculable wealth. I looked to see amazement Upon his regal face. Instead, I heard his fervent plea: "O my beloved people, As generation swiftly follows generation, May you always and forever Hold first things first, and last things last."
