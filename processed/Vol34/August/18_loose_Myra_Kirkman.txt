The centerpiece was a covered wagon drawn by four wooden oxen. The details of the harness, yoke, and wheels were almost perfect. A pioneer woman sat on the driver's seat, driving the oxen. The food served at the dinner was all prepared in pioneer style, and nearly all of the women wore pioneer costumes. This dinner was held at the home of the branch Relief Society president, Fern L. Wadsworth (standing first on the left). Sister Wadsworth, for many years an active worker in the Hamilton Branch, had directed much of the relief work and many hours of sewing were spent by the Relief Society sisters in the Wadsworth home. Sister Wadsworth passed away just ten days after this photograph was taken. Sister Elna P.

ELDEPARTMENT Theology The Life and Ministry of the Savior (Reference: Jesus the Christ, by Elder James E. Talmage) Elder Don B. Colton Lesson 2 The Need of a Redeemer" "The Antemortal Godship of Christ' For Tuesday, November 4, 1947 Objective: To show that under the gospel plan a Redeemer was absolutely necessary; and that Jesus, our Lord, had attained Godship in an antemortal existence. "THE Latter-day Saints affirm a belief that the human race existed as spirit children of our Father in a primeval world as real as the one in which we now live. The belief is unique in the world but is amply supported by scripture. It has already been shown that free agency has always been and always will be an essential element in God's great plan. Eternal progress and growth are also a part of the plan of the Holy One of Israel. A body of flesh and bones a tabernacle in which each spirit child might live, is essential to complete happiness. It has been revealed: For man is spirit. The elements are eternal, and spirit and element, inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy; and when separated, man cannot receive a fulness of joy (D. & C. 93:33-34). But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things. Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy (II Nephi 2:24-25). In that first estate, our Father, Elohim, knew us his spirit children. Page 560 He knew that some would be faithful and others would choose the path of destruction. He knew that in the body, we would meet temptation and sin and many would fail; all would come short of the glory of God, and, away from his presence, men would not progress but would retrogress. They must be helped if they were to gain salvation and final exaltation in the eternal worlds. Moreover, because of degeneracy and retrogression following the transgression of our first parents in the flesh, death would come into the world. While all the evil and sin that would come into the world were known by the Father, it must not be assumed that he caused them. He permits evil but shows us a way to avoid it. We have the right, however, to make the choice. We are free agents. Under the plan adopted in the council in heaven, the spirit children of our Father were to come to the earth, created by Jesus, and take bodies. It must not be forgotten that we elected to do this with, at least, a partial understanding of the   LESSON DEPARTMENT consequences. Whatever was done was done that man might be. The Latter-day Saints reject the doctrine that the "fall of Adam" was the result of the breaking of a moral law. Adam and Eye were noble people, and will be honored and acclaimed as our first great parents in mortal life. They did, however, break a law of God with reference to their bodies. They were forbidden to partake of certain things which had been condemned, They were told if they took into their bodies certain foods, that their bodies would lose the power which they then held to live forever, Elder Talmage teaches that the fall was brought about by eating things unfit to be taken into the body, which things made the body a thing of earth. Only immortal bodies or beings may dwell in the presence of God. When Adam and Eve partook of the forbidden fruit, they became mortal beings and fell from a higher to a lower estate, considering it from one standpoint, however, it was a state of advancement on the way of eternal progression. With this mortal State, death was inevitable, because mortality cannot put on immortality without it, given to him and who Was an essential part of the plan, became subject to physical ailments and human frailties. They and their posterity  being mortal were subject to temptation by Lucifer, whose lying and deceitfulness had beguiled Eve. Death, sickness, temptation, and sin came into the world. It seems just and logical that only those who were responsible for the 561 fall should pay the penalty attached to it. As Paul stated so plainly: Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned..., Therefore, as by the of. Fence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life (Rom. 5:12, 18), The atonement was made by the only One who was without sin and could pay the debt, We should not puzzled because of Vicarious x. In this case, it was "voluntary and love inspired," Latter-day Saints know that much of our temple work is vicarious. It, too, is love inspired. Much of the work of the world is done by agents. An eternal law had been broken, and there was but One who could Pay the penalty. That One was the Only Begotten Son of God who was foreordained in the heavens for that work. He was chosen to do the work by Elohim  the greatest of all, "For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself" (John 5:26). Had he not come, man would have gone to his grave and the flesh "to crumble to its mother earth, to rise no more." The resurrection has come and will come to all as a glorious gift from the Son of God. (Read II Nephi, Chapter g). Christ redeems us all from the consequences of Adam's transgressions and from our own sins if, with all our hearts, we accept him and obey his gospel plan. "For as in Adam al] die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive" (I Cor. 1 5:33). The Antemortal Godship of Christ This part of the lesson should be studied very carefully. It must be 562 borne in mind always that the Savior was ordained of the Father to do his mighty work. "It pleased the Father that in him [Christ] should all fulness dwell" (Col. 1:19). Let us try to state it clearly. In the council held in the heavens "before the foundations of the earth were laid," the Savior was chosen and ordained to create the world: For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. And 'he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell (Col. 1:16-19). (See also John 1:1-5, 14). Having created the earth, Jehovah became its father, and we were translated by choice into his kingdom. He delivered us from the power of darkness. He bought us with a price, that is, we have "redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins." Isaiah g:6 tells us: For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name _ shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. - Having created the earth, Jehovah became its Father. While upon earth, however, he instructed us that the title "Father" should be reserved for the Father of our spirits, Elohim. Jesus was, however, the Maker, the Organizer, the Creator of the heavens and the earth. He is referred to as the Father in that sense, but we must not confuse that title with the "Father of our spirits." A careful study of each context will show the difference. That the Savior was in reality God the Creator is revealed in plainness in the Book of Mormon. Samuel, the prophet, said: And also that ye might know of the coming of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of heaven and of earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning; and that ye might know of the signs of his coming, to the intent that ye might believe on his name (Helaman 14:12). Members should read also III Nephi 9:15. The same glorious truth is revealed in this dispensation by the voice of the resurrected Lord: Hearken, O ye people of my church, to whom the kingdom has been given; hearken ye and give ear to him who laid the foundation of the earth, and who made the heavens and all the hosts thereof, and by whom all things were made which live, and move, and have a being (D..& C. 45:1). Upon another occasion, he said: Behold, I am Jesus Christ the Son of the living God, who created the heavens and the earth; a light which cannot be hid in darkness (D. & C. 14:9). Jesus Christ is also the "Father" of those who abide in his gospel: In a revelation given through Joseph the Prophet to Emma Smith the Lord Jesus addressed the woman as "My daughter," and said: "for verily I say unto you, all those who receive my gospel are sons and daughters in my kingdom'"' (D. & C. 25:1). A forceful exposition of this relationship between Jesus Christ and the Father and those who comply with the requirements of the Gospel as His children was given by Abinadi, centuries before our Lord's birth in the flesh: 'And now I say unto you, who shall declare his generation? Behold, I say unto you, that when his soul has been made an offering for sin, he shall see his seed. And now what say ye? And LESSON DEPARTMENT who shall be his seed? Behold | say unto you, that whosoever has heard the words his seed (Mosiah 15:10-13), Doctrinal Exposition by the First Presidency and the Twelve, June 30, 1916, JAMEs E. Talmage: The Articles of Faith, pp, 467, 468, 469. Of Jesus Christ as the Father we read in the Doctrine and Covenants 93:2-4: 563 world and made flesh my tabernacle, and dwelt among the sons of men. The treatise in the text on titles and names given to our Lord should be read. Here we need only give a word of warning against the too frequent use of the name Christ. That ed. We should reverently, it and Only Begotten in the flesh is Jesus Christ. These sacred names should never be taken in vain oy spoken irreverently, Questions and Suggestions for Discussion 1. State briefly the Causes which made the coming of the Redeemer absolutely necessary if mankind is to be saved, 2. Discuss vicarious work and show how 3. Give reasons why people should not indulge in visiting teaching Messages Ou, Pioneer Heritage Lesson 2 Colonization President Amy Brown Lyman For Tuesday, November 4, 1947 AMONG the outstanding accomplishments of the Latter-day Saints are their Projects in colonization. They are known the world OVE as successful and expert colonizers. Wherever they have settled, they have set out at once to build homes and communities, 564 come frontier and desert environment, and to develop and utilize all available resources, Among the many factors in their SuCCEss as Community and nation-builders are their industry, diligence, and Perseverance,   and their ability to co-operate and to organize and utilize to the very highest degree all of their available manpower, Dr. Thomas N. Carver, Professor of Political Economy at Harvard University, under the title "A Positive Religion," writes. Study it in miniature; Mormon colonies building... They (the Mormons) started great and glorious commonwealth. Hey found a desert and blossom as the rose. Accomplished in only one way. That way is the economizing of man-power. Dr. Carver Points out that manpower may be economized by discovering hidden talent and giving it a chance to function; or by working together harmonious. The common cultivating sound They are wasting their own vital energy, their Own manpower, He continues: I have never found more sound and wholesome Personal habits than among the Mormons. I have never mingled with People who showed fewer signs of dissipation, Mormons as colonizers. The ability of the Latter-day Saints to organize and utilize man across the plains in 1847. It was shown after they Industry individual had definite tasks to perform. Everybody worked. From the beginning the Pioneers operated in harmony with the admonition of Paul; " this we command you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat" (II Thess.  88. 3:10), and also with the revelation: "Thou shalt not be idle; for he that is idle shall not eat the bread nor wear the garments of the laborer" (D.&C. 42:42), Suggestions for Discussion Through questions and discussion, show: a. Why the Pioneers needed all manpower or working power of their men b. Why talent was searched out c. In what way habits of good living helped them. Ye solid rocks weep for and let all the sons of God forever and ever! (D.&C. 128:23) shout for joy!' And let the LESSON DEPARTMENT Work Meeting Sewing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting) Work Meeting Committee, Leone G. Layton, Chairman Preview of Lessons for 1947-48 HE optional sewing course was introduced into Relief Society work meeting in 1946-47 in order to give to women who so desired opportunity to learn, under helpful supervision, the fundamentals of sewing. The General Board has been delighted with the accomplishments of the stakes and wards which have followed the recommended course. Women who had never before made clothing have learned to sew and many, more experienced sewers, have been enabled to add to their sewing skill by learning short cuts and new methods. Many homes have been benefited by this learning, and many children have taken pride in wearing the workmanship of 'their mothers' hands. In view of the success and interest shown in the course, and because of a continued need, the General Board feels it advisable to outline a course for 1947-48. There are still many women in the Church who are unable to do their own home sewing and would welcome opportunity to learn. We urge those wards which have not, as yet, organized a sewing class to make every effort to do so. We feel that in addition to the benefit derived by the individual, there is benefit to the Society as well, in that the more women who become interested in sewing and acquire sewing skill, the more will be willing and able to help Relief Society fill its sewing requirements. The course is, however, for optional use by the wards and should in no way interfere with the necessary Welfare or Relief Society sewing. The course, as outlined for 1947- 48, will introduce material of proven benefit to women and will be suitable for classes just beginning, as well as provide additional instruction for more advanced sewers. It is the desire of the General Board that Latter-day Saint women learn to use those touches which make a garment look "not homemade but handmade." The same textbook may be used as was recommended for 1946-47, The Complete Book of Sewing. In addition to this text, many fine and helpful articles may be found in pamphlets published by the various pattern companies and in current household magazines. Eight lessons will be published in Thefrom August through March. A ward which desires to do so may substitute a fashion show in place of one of the lessons. The titles for the lessons are: Lesson 1. '"Musts'" for Success in Sewing Lesson 2. Choosing a Pattern Suiting the pattern to the figure and the material. Lesson 3. Altering a Pattern to Suit Figure Types Enlarging or reducing to suit figure peculiarities, Instruction on how to put a sleeve in an armhole, and on how to Suit the type of pad to the garment, Lesson 5.
