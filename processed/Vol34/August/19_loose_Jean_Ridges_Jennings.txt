Jean Ridges Jennings EWERY woman who does her own sewing, whether she is a beginner or has had much experience, hopes to have her finished garment look as professional as possible. Many times her success or failure hinges on the little things, the details that are thoughtlessly slighted or unknowingly overlooked. Our aim in this lesson is to call attention to some points that are at all times important, but frequently neglected. One of the first really important things to watch is the color of the thread. Be sure that it matches the material exactly after it is sewed. Thread stitches up lighter than it appears on the spool. A good rule to follow is to match the color of the highlight on the spool to the goods. Use fine pins and needles to avoid making marks in the cloth while working on it. The less a garment is handled in the making, the better it will look when completed. Repeated stitching and picking out to remedy mistakes give the cloth a worked-over look that detracts from its newness. So get the habit of basting well and freely to make sure machine stitching will be right before it is used. Then remove bastings in short pieces by cutting them at frequent intervals. Pressing is all important. Be sure to press as you go. Follow the rule of never sewing over an unpressed seam. But before using the iron on a garment always make a test on a sample of material to determine what method of pressing is best. Many fabrics are injured by improper pressing. Most fabrics cannot be ironed directly. Many times moisture is harmful. Materials with a nap are more successfully pressed with two cloths, one dry, next to the material, one moist, over the dry. In some cases merely steaming with a moist cloth lightly touched by a hot iron is best. Make a test on the fabric with different methods and determine which is most satisfactory. Above all, avoid overpressing which gives a flat, shiny look. Strive for absolute* accuracy in all work. Follow pattern markings exactly so that pieces fit together in their proper proportion. Make a habit of always stitching out the full seam allowance on all seams, unless making allowance for fit. This cannot be stressed too much, because many garments are thrown completely out of line by deviating from the amount taken in at the seams. LESSON DEPARTMENT 567 Keep the garment hung on a clothes hanger at all times, and not just folded up. This saves repeated pressings, which take time and are hard on materials. Press as you go, and keep your dress properly hung, and it will always be pressed. Remember there are two kinds of
trouble�the trouble you take and the trouble you make. Have one, and avoid the other. Organize your work well in the beginning. Do all steps in their proper order. Take infinite pains. Remember�If it's worth doing at all it's worth doing well.
Literature�Literature of the Doctrine and Covenants
Elder H. Wayne Driggs
Lesson 2�Literary Values of the Doctrine and Covenants For Tuesday, November 18, 1947
Objective: To appreciate the Doctrine and Covenants as literature through a discussion of the elements of truth and beauty it contains.
ONE of the great lyric poets, John Keats, who died at twenty-six, left the world this immortal line, "A thing of beauty is a joy forever." The oft-quoted Keats must have sensed his early death, for in his writings are found many hints of his love for life and many fears for its uncertainty. To compensate for worldly insecurities he wrote of steadfast stars, of autumn's constant hush, of night birds' returning songs. In his Ode on a Grecian Urn, one senses the comfort he must have gained from knowing that such a work of art was not soon touched by time's on-moving hand, and that though the figures engraved upon its polished clay could never move, yet, always, as if true, they would remain forever beautiful.
Along with the truths which great literature propounds, may, also, be found the beauty that lives in their discovery. So it is with scripture. For its full appreciation a reader must gain more than mere mastery of its mechanics of language, or of the creative power which directs the
writing of lines, an immortal power which gives them immortal cast. Only in this way can the full joy of truth and beauty be known.
To the student of scripture there comes the double assignment. He must be enlightened with the doctrine of truth and to appreciate more fully its message to the heart, as well as the mind, he must know something of the form in which thoughts are expressed.
Our most modern scripture as understood by Latter-day Saints today is the Doctrine and Covenants. Within its inspired sections may be found the same power of literary excellence that characterizes the scriptures of old. One need not look far within its pages before he finds the marks of literary form which, if studied and understood even but briefly, will add to one's appreciation of its truth and beauty.
Let us, then, as students of literary values to be found in the Doctrine and Covenants, seek out a few of most characteristic marks for our study. We need to know a few 568 of the signposts that point the way. In good literary form may be found such things as economy of words, effective choice of words, and the forceful use of words in sentence patterns. To understand these values in scriptural reading is truly to read literature, rather than merely to read about it. For illustration consider the following oft-quoted selections from the Doctrine and Covenants in the light of the elements of good literary form just mentioned. Let us first consider word economy. And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives! For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father That by him and through him and of him, the worlds are and were created; and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God (76:22-24). Note the placement of the italicized phrases in the sentence. They are thrown ahead of a main thought which follows. A reversal of order would demand more words and lessen the effectiveness of the sentence pattern. Another example of word economy: Remember the worth" of souls is great in the sight of God; For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh; wherefore he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might repent and come unto him (18:10, 11). If the italicized phrases were to read as many writers would pen it, it would be as follows: "The Lord who is your Redeemer," etc. In the following excerpt note the word choice. Catch the force of the italicized words which are struck with cutting edges: How long can rolling waters remain impure? What power shall stay the heavens? As well might man stretch forth his puny arm to stop the Missouri river in_ its decreed course, or to turn it up stream, as to hinder the Almighty from pouring down knowledge from heaven upon the heads of the Latter-day Saints (121:33). In the quotation below regard the force of sentence pattern. Note especially the skill with which the words of significant meaning are set at the beginning and ending of the sentence, thus keeping a balance of thought well knit within. Search these commandments, for they are true and faithful, and the prophecies and promises which are in them shall be fulfilled (1:37). Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah I confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; and this shall never be taken again from the earth, until the sons of Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness (13). Economy, effect, and force play no small part in literary form. In all good writing these marks are found. The simple and direct style of the Doctrine and Covenants is in harmony with this thought. The beauty of truth is borne out in such writing. With these thoughts in mind let us consider a characteristic literary pattern found in all true scriptural writing, that of parallel structure. In this Hebraic style an emphatic phrase is echoed several times throughout a passage with pleasing effect. The Doctrine and Covenants is characteristically Hebraic in style. Note: LESSON DEPARTMENT For my soul delighteth in the song of Let for he that keepeth the laws of God hath reign, and subdues all enemies under his Activities and Readings For Appreciation It is the Purpose of this first lesson to present three elements of literary form: namely, skill in the use of economy of words, effective choice of words, and the forceful use of such factors in scriptural Treading is to increase one's appreciation of its beauty, Other literary values to be found in the Doctrine and Covenants will be treated in lessons that follow. For and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together, of the Lord is unto all men, and there is 569 tone to escape; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not  n in these last days. Forth and none shall Stay them, for I the Lord have commanded them (1:1-5). Require not miracles, except I shall command you, except casting out devils, healing the sick, and against poisonous ser. I come, Jacob shall flourish in the wilderness, and the Lamanites shall blossom as the rose. Pointed (49:23-25), 570 I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise (82:10). Therefore, verily I say unto you, my friends, call your solemn assembly, as I have commanded you. And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith. Organize yourselves, prepare every needful thing; and establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God, That your incomings may be in the name of the Lord; that your outgoings may be in the name of the Lord; that all your salutations may be in the name of the Lord, with uplifted hands unto the Most High. Therefore, cease from all your light speeches, and from all laughter, from all your lustful desires, from all your pride and light-mindedness, and from all your wicked doings. Appoint among yourselves a teacher, and let not all be spokesmen at once; but let one speak at a time and let all listen unto his sayings, that when all have spoken that all may be edified of all, and that every man may have an equal privilege. See that ye love one another; cease to be covetous; learn to impart one to another as the gospel requires. Cease to be idle; cease to be unclean; cease to find fault one with another; cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy x bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated (88:117-124). And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones; And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures; And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint. And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them. Amen (89:18-21). Wherefore, fear not even unto death; for in this world your joy is not full, but in me your joy is full. Therefore, care not for the body, neither the life of the body, but care for the soul, and for the life of the soul. And seek the face of the Lord always, that in patience ye may possess your souls, and ye shall have eternal life. When men are called unto mine everlasting gospel, and covenant with an everlasting covenant, they are accounted as the salt of the earth and the savor of men; they are called to be the savor of men; therefore, if that salt of the earth lose its savor, behold, it is thenceforth good for nothing only to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men (101:36-40). As a second activity have each member of the class choose a favorite passage of her own to discuss in the manner outlined above. Social Science Essentials in Home Training Lesson 2 Honesty Elder Joseph Jacobs For Tuesday, November 25, 1947 Objective: To show that honesty is fundamental to an upright character, and that teaching of this principle and a consistent example set by daily living must be given children in the home. N a chemistry class in college the students were assigned several experiments to work out and hand in by the end of the term, in order to complete a certain unit. As they were finished and handed in, the experiments were checked off in the professor's roll book and posted on the bulletin board each month. LESSON DEPARTMENT Early in the second month, Tom Russell's name appeared on the list, those experiments, For several days he IS Occurrence and was tempted to let it Pass. Under the circumstances, no one would know Or question the fact that the work However, his He went to the professor and explained that there had been a mistake, that he an evil act apparently escapes detection, it leaves a mark upon the soul which cannot be erased. A proverb of old says:    good name is rather to be chosen than great riches" (Prov, 22:1), It is a high compliment to be "Own as an honest man, and too much emphasis cannot be made upon this basic Principle of living: J. P. Morgan once loaned a large sum of money to a man who had very little collateral to offer as security. He was questioned for this apparent rashness. Morgan answered that he made the loan because of the man's reputation over a long period, for his high honor and integrity. When asked if collateral was not also important, Morgan replied he would not loan even a single dollar to a man he could not trust, regardless of his collateral (Dr. Franklin L. West: "Church Section," The Deseref News, March 30, 1946). Integrity, or honesty, is fundamental to the structure of our society. Business is dependent upon the honesty of the individual members of society. It is estimated that seventy-five per cent of our modern business is done on credit, which simply means that people are assumed to be as good as their word. In his book Fundamentals oi Prosperity, Roger W. Babson relates the following incident: While on a recent visit to Chicago, I was taken by the president of one of the largest banks to see his new safety deposit vaults. He described these � as bank presidents will� as the largest and most marvelous vaults in the city. He expatiated on the heavy steel doors and the various electrical and mechanical contrivances which protect the stocks and bonds deposited in the institution. While at the bank a person came in to rent a box. He made the arrangements for the box, and the box was handed to him. In it he deposited some stocks and bonds which he took from his pocket. Then the clerk who had charge of the vaults went to a rack on the wall and took out a key and gave it to the man. . . . The man then put the box into one of the steel compartments, shut the door and turned the key. He then went away feeling perfectly secure on account of those steel doors and various mechanical and electrical contrivances existing to protect his wealth. I did not wish to give him a sleepless night so I said nothing; but I couldn't help thinking how easy it would have been for that poorly-paid, hunchbacked clerk to make a duplicate of that key before he delivered it to the renter of that box. With such a duplicate, the clerk could have made that man penniless within a few minutes after he had left the building. The great steel door and the electrical and mechanical contrivances would have been absolutely valueless. Of course the point I am making is that the real security which that great bank in Chicago had to offer its clientele lay not in the massive stone columns in front of its structure, nor in the heavy steel doors; nor the electrical and mechanical contrivances. The real strength of that institution rested in the honesty the absolute integrity of its clerks (pp. 13-15). What Statement Do We Have Which Shows the Latter-day Saint Belief in Honesty? As Latter-day Saints we believe in adhering to honesty in all its varied phases. The Prophet Joseph Smith, in giving a brief summary of our beliefs, stated, among other things, "We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men...." (13th Article of faith). What Does It Mean to Be Honest With One's Self? Being honest with one's self is a noble ambition. It means living up to one's highest ideals. It means not succumbing to petty practices (even though they might never be discovered by others) that may jeopardize one's reputation or character, or that may injure someone else. It was Shakespeare who said: "To thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man." No matter what the world thinks of us, we must live with ourselves and a Clear conscience is worth more than all the money or power in the world. The business man who misleads or overcharges and then salves his conscience with the doctrine that such practices are necessary in business, is untrue to himself and to others. The politician who shifts and stalls to keep in the good graces of different groups, that he may benefit personally, is a menace to society. The person who adroitly phrases a statement to give the wrong impression is untruthful in a very cowardly way. William George Jordan Says: He who is careless of his appointments is the thoughtless thief of another's time. The man who makes truth his watchword is careful in his words, he seeks to be accurate, neither understanding nor overcoloring. He never states as a fact that of which he is not sure. What he says has the ting of sincerity, the hallmark of pure gold. If he praises you, you accept his statement as "net," you do not have to work out a problem in mental arithmetic on the side to see what discount you ought to make before you accept his judgment. His promise counts for something.... His honesty is not policy. The man who is honest merely because it is "the best policy" is not really honest, he is only politic. Usually such a man would forsake his seeming loyalty to truth and would work overtime for the devil if he could get better terms. Man is usually loyal to what he most desires. The man who lies to save a nickel, merely proclaims that he esteems a nickel more than he does his honor. He who sacrifices his ideals, truth and character, for mere money or position, is weighing his conscience in one pan of scale against a bag of gold in the other (The Power of Truth, pp. 5-8). Can the Golden Rule Be Used as a Guide to Honesty? The Savior gave us a yardstick with which to measure honesty. It is so simple that even a child can understand it, and yet the whole world is suffering today from the lack of its application. It is stated in what is commonly referred to as the Golden Rule: "Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them..." Is it a Form of Dishonesty to Neglect Church Obligations? One phase of dishonesty is revealed in the matter of how we carry out our obligations to the Lord, although many do not look upon it in that light. When we become members of the Church, we are under LESSON DEPARTMENT obligation to support the Church by attending sacrament meetings, the payment of tithes, and living upright lives. When we receive the Priesthood or are appointed to any office we assume other obligations, the performance of which is entirely dependent upon our own honesty. To fall down on these responsibilities is to be untrue to those obligations. How May We Teach Honesty at Home? The foundation for honesty should be laid very early in a child's life. From its very infancy a child should be shown the straightforward way. Example is always better than precept. A child is very quick to see any inconsistency between the spoken word and the actions of his patents. The procedures in the little happenings of everyday life sink deep into a child's consciousness. Parents must live the truth if they desire their children to do so. A mother cannot successfully teach honesty at home and then lie about the child's age when buying a ticket to a movie. A mother cannot give a visitor a false impression and expect the child to be frank and trustworthy in his expressions. If a child returns from the store with more money than is due, he should be told to return it immediately. If he is found to have in his possession a toy which does not belong to him, he should take it back. Do not scold and reprimand with anger. Gently explain that one must not take that which belongs to someone else as it is not right nor fair to others. It is well to have a child account for money given him to buy groceries or to make other purchases and to give him an 573 allowance for personal needs. It is well to keep in mind that one act of dishonesty may wreck the confidence which it has taken years to build. Therefore no promise should ever be given to the child with the intention of pacifying him for the moment. Punishment or reward should follow the promise as sure as the rising of the sun. Then the child will understand that his promises, too, are not to be idle words but some thing to be depended upon. What Is the Proper Treatment for Lying? A child should not be scolded and threatened for telling a lie. Lying is not a disease but a symptom. There is always a reason for a lie. It may be because of fear, to escape punishment, or to cover up some deficiency. It may be the result of a desire for praise or an urge to gain recognition from one's friends. It may even be an overabundance of imagination which leads a child on and on in a recital of some fantastic story. "If, through careful observation and kind treatment, the reason for the lie can be detected, then some corrective measure may be taken and a cure effected. Perhaps a child needs a little spending money of his own, or more praise and encouragement at home. Maybe he needs an opportunity to excel in something that he might make a favorable impression on his associates. Perhaps he needs help with his studies or training in courtesy or any number of things which would help him to feel secure and at peace with the world and his associates. J. Edgar Hoover of the Federal Bureau of Investigation once made this statement: "If I had a son I would be afraid. He would never 574 catch me in a lie because I would never tell one." He added, also, that criminals have one thing in common  they are all liars. Angelo Patri Says:; A child of five has no concept of truth for truth's sake. That is a concept of a matured mind and spirit. It comes late to most of us. There are some of us to whom it never comes. It is too much to expect of a little child. Truth-telling must be made beautiful, rewarding, before he can be expected to practice it much, especially in the face of fear. A frightened child has lost his grip on his mind and must fall back on his instinct for self-preservation.... The sure child, the one secure in his faith in his people, is much more able to see and tell the truth. Go gently with this trait of childhood. Listen. Try to find what moved the child to the wrong expression. Set the stage for truth by gentleness, by faith in the child's fundamental honesty, by patient listening and more patient correction. "We should ever speak the truth but only in love and kindness. Truth should ever extend the hand of love; never the hand clenching a bludgeon. "No matter what price a man may pay for the truth, he is getting it at a bargain" (Wr1am GeorgE JordaN: The Power of Truth, pp. 18, 19). Additional Reference Dr. Harold T. Christensen: '"Honesty, the Core of Character," social science lesson published in The, pp. 59-63. FIELDS OF GRAIN Evelyn Fijeldsted Let us walk through fields of waving grain Where clouds sail high and soft winds blow, Where sunshine like a halo falls On ripening grain, now bending low. Where startled pheasants fly away To hide in willow reefs near by, While rows of blackbirds on the fence Soon disappear in sheaves of rye. Like shadowed folds of sun-dyed silk, Broad acres of ripe wheat are spread; Enchanting music may be heard As zephyrs touch each golden head. It is hallowed ground where grain fields sway; That his great truths they might attain, The Master his disciples taught The while they walked through fields of grain.
