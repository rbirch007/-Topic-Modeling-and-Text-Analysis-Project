Prize-Winning Poems Eliza Roxey Snow Memorial Prize Poem Contest ETHEL NEWMAN ECCLES First Prize Poem Our Hands Our Heads In Thine Ethel Newman Eccles Inspiration Only a thread across the desert sands, A twining thread, held by the Master's hands; Taut at the time when check was needed there, Unleashed again and free as the heaven-sent air. Unleashed, for well God knew this sturdy band, Whose footsteps he had turned toward desert sand. Hand-picked from all humanity's great store  Weighed in the balance; you could not ask for more. He knew their trials, and yet he knew their power; Pledged as they were to make each changing hour A hallowed part, to firmly plant anew Christ's Church, revealed in latter day and true. Page 9  Dedication "This is the Place" the leader raised his hands, The challenge of the mountains or the sands To this small band of weary pioneers; God help them see the future in the years. "And it shall truly blossom as the rose," And lo, it did, and so the story goes: Great homes were builded well, with mountains 'round, Irrigation, too, to wet the thirsty ground; And temple spires in majesty rose high To link the holiness with azure sky; And government became integral part, And schools and colleges and cultural art. All these and all that makes humanity Unchained from lower life on land and sea, Unfolded there with every passing hour, Man's will upheld by God's majestic power. By Faith We Walk What now? A hundred precious years gone by. In gratitude, with dauntless heads held high, We face the future with its atom fear, And pray, dear God, that thou art ever near; So near that thou wilt touch us with thy power And give us courage through each changing hour  Our heritage from pioneers before. Hold thou our hands as we pass on through the door Into that age that no man dares to think  There is no turning; we are at the brink. So may we face it without torturing fear, Our hands in thine, dear Lord, again we pioneer.

PRIZE-WINNING POEMS   EVA WILLES WANGSGAARD Second Prize Poem Release From: the South Seas Eva Willes Wangsgaard I I'm going home to trees unleafed, each bud Hooded from cold, clean limbs that web the sky; And when the wintry down escapes and whirls, My long heart hunger will be fed by storm. Ain-rivered skies, farewell. Again I'll know Fine-needled balsams feathered white with snow.  II I'll see the spring creep back through lilac buds And smell brown furrows fresh from snow's retreat; The ivory-petaled cherry's fragrant suds Will vie with peach tree coral, cool and sweet. The tall, clean tulip stems will speak of lands Fertile, but frugal as my grandsire's thumb; I'll warm a snow-damp clod in grateful hands, And kneel in bluebells till the kind tears come. Some day, shut-eyed, I'll view this tropic isle, Bathed in warm rain, and be a little fond Of leaves too lush and hues too loud, and smile At endless waves and all that lies beyond. Tonight, my heart resents the hours between Me and my home, where wand-slim aspens lean.

PRIZE-WINNING POEMS if MIRANDA SNOW WALTON Third Prize Poem Centennial Conversation Miranda Snow Walton A Great-Granddaughter Speaks: Great-Grandmother Ann, were you sad that day In the long, long ago, when you sailed away From your home in a land far over the sea? Did your young heart harbor perplexity? Did you face your future in doubt and fear, As your great-granddaughter is doing here? Of what did you dream in this alien land, As your tired feet plodded through sage and sand? You could not have visioned the things I know When you entered this valley so long ago, This Inland Empire, where temples raise 3 Their arms in rejoicing at heaven's ways; You could not see then, as I do today, The gold of the grainfields, the orchards gay; The cities that lie on the valley's breast, Each one a jewel that God's hand has caressed; Then, what was the vision that made you strong, What dream gave you courage to journey on? The Great-Grandmother Answers: Great-Granddaughter Ann, the dream I had Was a simple one, and it made me glad; Though I knew the heartbreak of goodbye tears, It banished my doubts, and dispelled my fears. I dreamed of a home in a peaceful place, Of a good man's love, and a baby's face. My home was a dugout where wild sage grew, But our love was there, and my dream was true. Oh, child of my grandson, resolve this day To set your feet on your rightful way: No matter what struggle a true love brings, Hold fast to the good and the simple things, A home where no evil nor hate abide; Keep faith, and virtue, and truth inside; Hold love as a treasure that has no price, And a baby's laughter as paradise; Do your woman's work in this world of woe, For out of such things great empires grow. Se It should be satisfactory evidence that you are in the path of life, if you love God and your brethren with all your hearts. You may see, or think you see, a thousand faults in your brethren; yet they are organized as you are; they are flesh of your flesh, bone of your bone; they are of your Father who is in heaven; we are all His children, and should be satisfied with each other as far as possible. The main difficulty in the hearts of those who are dissatisfied is, they are not satisfied with themselves (Discourses of Brigham Young, page 271).
