General Relief Society Conference October 2 and 3, 1946 THE annual general Relief Society conference was held October 2 and 3, 1946, at Salt Lake City, Utah, with President Belle S. Spafford presiding. All departments and phases of Relief Society work were considered at this conference due to the discontinuance, announced in January 1946, of the holding of a semi-annual general Relief Society conference in April. Henceforth, an annual general Relief Society conference each year will be held just preceding the general semiannual Church conference in October. The following sessions were held: On Wednesday, October 2, morning and afternoon meetings were held in the Assembly Hall consisting of departmental sessions, which were presented consecutively to allow stake and mission officers and board members the opportunity of becoming acquainted with all phases of the year's work. The chairmen of the respective General Board committees introduced the work of their various departments. Elder H. Wayne Driggs, writer of the theology lessons, delivered an address "The Final Year in the Church History Course." A ward literature lesson demonstration was presented under the direction of Leone G. Layton, chairman of the literature committee, with the assistance of ward and stake leaders. A panel discussion "Family Problems of Today," under the leadership of Leone O. Jacobs, chairman of the social science Page 28 committee, was given, with Mary G. Judd, Anna B. Hart and Blanche B. Stoddard also taking part on the panel. Counselor Marianne C. Sharp gave general instructions on the educational work for the coming -year. President Amy Browm Lyman extended her greetings and blessing near the close of the morning session to the Relief Society officers present. In the late afternoon, departments in music, Magazine, and secretarial work were conducted simultaneously in the Assembly Hall, General Board rooms, and Barratt Hall, respectively. A reception for stake and mission officers and board members was held Wednesday evening in the Lafayette Ballroom, Hotel Utah.. On Thursday morning, October 3, in the Assembly Hall, an officers' meeting was held for stake and mission officers and board members. At this meeting, President Spafford gave "Official Instructions"; Elder Joseph Fielding Smith delivered an address "Hearken to Counsel"; and Elder Harold B. Lee spoke on "The Place of Relief Society in the Welfare Plan." All but one stake in the Church was represented at this meeting, and seventeen missions. Thursday afternoon, a general meeting was held in the Tabernacle for Relief Society members and the general public. This session was addressed by the General Presidency of Relief Society, and President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. Spoke on "Our Wives and Our Mothers in the Eternal GENERAL RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE Plan." Other members of the General Church Authorities, members of the General Church Welfare Committee and specially invited guests were in attendance at the Thursday meetings. The music for the conference was under the direction of Sister Florence J. Madsen, member of the General Board. A duet was sung by Iris Taylor and Janet B. Peterson, with Sister Madsen as accompanist. Sister Iola Petersen played the prelude and postlude music at the three officers' meetings. Thursday afternoon at the general session in the Tabernacle, a combined chorus of Singing Mothers from the nine stakes of the Jordan Valley Region rendered the music under the baton of Sister Madsen, with Brother Alexander Schreiner at the organ. This same group was asked by the First Presidency to furnish the special music for the first two sessions of the 117 semi-annual general Church conference, held the following day on Friday, October 4, 1946. The opening and closing prayers 2 at the first three meetings were offered by Relief Society stake presidents. President Amy Brown Lyman offered the invocation at the general meeting on Thursday afternoon and Sister Jessie Evans Smith gave the benediction. On Monday morning, October 7,. In the Relief Society General Board room in the Bishop's Building, a meeting was held by the Relief Society General Presidency, members of the General Board mission committee and other General Board members, with the mission Relief Society presidents of sixteen missions. The addresses of President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. "Our Wives and Our Mothers in the Eternal Plan"; "Hearken to Counsel," by Elder Joseph Fielding Smith; and "The Place of Relief Society in the Welfare Plan," by Elder Harold B. Lee, were printed in full in the December 1946 issue of TheDigests of some of the talks given at the general Relief Society conference are printed in this issue of the Magazine. The addresses of the General Presidency of Relief Society will appear in the March number of TheDEPARTMENTAL MEETINGS, OCTOBER 2, 1946 The Final Year in the Church History Course Elder H. Wayne Driggs Y dear sisters, I shall need all of your sustaining faith to carry forward what is in my heart to say in regard to the work that fell to my lot over the period of three years now past. To talk about the final year of the Church History series, in a sense, is like trying to paint the scenes of ' America on one canvas. It is breathtaking. This year we are talking about the "coming of age" period in Church history. During half of my life I have lived around the scenes of the Church, where things began. I know Broome County. I know the spot where Brother Knight first greeted the Prophet and permitted him to hold cottage meetings. I have been in Oakland, which was Harmony, Pennsylvania. And many times I have been to the place where John the Baptist first appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith. I spent sixteen months of my mission in and about Palmyra. So, to me, these things are not simply dots on a map, or a line indicating a river; they are far more than that. I think now of the little branch in Binghamton, New York, where Sister Driggs and I used to go with our boys, and would meet with two or three Relief Society sisters, much, 1 imagine, as they did in days when the Church was referred to as the "Tittle flock," when the word, the revealed word of God, was the important thing. The Doctrine and Covenants at that time, in the early days of the Church, had not been accepted in congregation as the word of God. They knew it to be the word of God because the Prophet had spoken it. Now, we have had, in two years, through this study, an opportunity to have the personal side of Church history revealed through the lives of the men and women who lived it, and I should like to say that one of the most important things to Te member about the scriptures is that they were lived before they were written, and that is why they are of such great import to us. In the early days, the members of the Church relied upon the word of the Lord, and they had to take it literally to understand its significance. Now, what has happened? We have had, in the expansion of the Church, an opportunity to see just the sort of thing I see here before me this morning hundreds of fine women, firm in the faith, coming from many places to learn from the organized Relief Society, its president, counselors, and Board, the fine things that they have to give to carry forward the work that has long since passed the "little flock" stage, on into the "coming of age" period of this great Church of ours. Now, I think if we can keep that in mind, it may help us more in this final series of lessons than anything else that I could suggest, because when you have the personal drama of the Church, as it was up to the time of the martyrdom, and as it was after the martyrdom, in the crossing of the plains, there is always the touch of the human hand, so to speak, in helping you to see why these principles of the gospel are true. But now, what happens? You think of the Church collectively, and you think of the Relief Society organization, and the splendid educational system, and the Priesthood quorums, and all of the auxiliary work, and the Welfare Plan, and all these things, making it difficult to understand, and to keep that fine, warm touch of the human relations idea that came in the early days of the Church. I have tried to do two things for you. First of all, not to confuse you with a long list of questions at the end of the lesson, which seem to get away from the central idea. Rather, I have tried to focus your attention sharply on one or two significant questions which promote thinking and discussion, first from your class, and then, after that has been carried  GENERAL RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE forward, to invite you to do some actual reading of the Doctrine and Covenants, which brings about most of the discussion, and should bring the real heart of the discussion. NOW, there is something significant to me about the first vision, in the way in which Joseph Smith later wrote it. He said: "We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost." He did not say: "We believe in God, the Eternal Father, His Son, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost." But he repeats: ""We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost." It seems to me that he placed with conviction every comma in that sentence, because he had seen the individuality of the two, the Father and the Son, and he knew that the Holy Ghost was just as distinct, although a personage of spirit. I have suggested that you give the class a chance to think of the historical events that have come during the hundred and sixteen years of our Church, and then discuss those that are found in the lesson in the light of the Article of Faith which applies particularly to the events being discussed. Now, there is one comforting thought, at least to me, as the writer of the lessons, and that is that we can rely upon a great deal of backlog information about these things. In other words, you have studied Church history for a long time, and you will study it for a long time more, and there will come to you added significance to these thoughts 31 as to the worthwhile character of the lives of the saints who gave so much to make this Church what it is today. And like a radiant gem, meeting new light and color, there comes through a heart-warming experience of reading the word of God for purposes centered around a given ideal, which is the lesson objective, a chance to depart from the world and to have faith renewed and strength given, so that one may know in these trying times, that there is an anchorage to living. - There are eight lessons, the first one an overview, the second one in terms of the Priesthood callings. Certainly, I will not have to say much to you on the organization of the Relief Society and its significance, but I have tried in that to give something that has a little different slant. The educational system is put forth, and also three of the auxiliary organizations. Then, I have discussed the Welfare Plan, with all its important significance in these days. By way of summary, I felt that something should be said for the unsung heroes of the Church. What a wealth of experience this lesson can be when you bring to your class the stories of the unsung heroes of Zion, who have made the great cause what it is! The final lesson is a review of the century. It has been a privilege to write the series, and I am certain that this experience that I have had this morning has made me realize, more than anything else, what has been meant in the phrase, "the coming of age" period of the Church. God help you to appreciate these values, I pray, through Christ our Lord, Amen. The Worth of Testimony Bearing Achsa E, Paxman Member, Relief Society General Board T is indeed a privilege to meet today in Relief Society Conference with you women from all over the Church, who have a testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ. 'The goal of Relief Society is to help women to be better mothers and wives; to be devoted Church members who teach by example, as well as precept, the principles and teachings of our Church; to help form proper attitudes through intellectual understanding gained in Relief Society work; to help gain faith sufficient to be blessed with a testimony of the truthfulness of the restored gospel. It is the responsibility of every true Latter-day Saint woman, who has a testimony of the gospel, to. Maintain high ideals, and to develop a philosophy of life that will be an inspiration to all with whom she comes in contact. The burden of Christ's teaching was that men should keep the commandments. He told his disciples to go out and teach men everywhere. The promise was that they who believed should be saved. There is no promise to any other. To the multitude, who crowded around Christ the day after he had fed them, he said: Ye seek me, not because ye saw miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled. Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you (John 6:26, 27). What a privilege we have in our Church to give service, to prepare lessons of instructions to various groups, to attend meetings where inspired and well-prepared talks are given, and then to have the privilege of bearing our testimonies. Brigham Young said: "More testimonies are gained on your feet than on your knees." Testimony bearing is an expression that God is the beloved Father who rules and guides our lives. Our expressions of appreciation for our Father in heaven, for blessings and knowledge of his divinity and guidance, are a great help in our lives for righteous living. 'The Lord has given commandments and instructions through ancient and __ latter-day prophets, and bearing our testimonies to the divinity of these words is a great blessing to us. Mental assent to the gospel is not enough. There must be a power that drives us to action. Our faith is but the motivation for action. If we have the proper faith, we cannot be restrained from bearing our testimonies, and, because of our faith, our words and actions, and our lives, will be an influence on others. Appreciation is one of the greatest needs of the world today. A thoughtful deed, the needed praise to our associates, give encouragement and happiness. God also appreciates our acknowledgement of his blessings unto us. Many of our boys who served in the recent World War were blessed  GENERAL RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE and encouraged through their faith in God and in the ideals taught them in our Church. Hundreds expressed appreciation of their belief in God and their faith in the resurrection, and no matter what their suffering or trials, not even the reality of death itself could keep them from worshiping God in spirit and in truth. Through their testimonies they were blessed, and many had the great joy of bringing the gospel to their companions. What a gift and power is testimony! The strength of Mormonism lies in the individual testimonies of its members. What a privilege our missionaries have to learn the gospel and to teach it to the people in the various missions of the Church! How they love to bear their testimonies of their faith in God and the truthfulness of 33 the gospel, for they are following the teachings of the Savior, "Feed my sheep." It is hoped that the Relief Society officers of every ward and branch of the Church will consider it a special privilege of missionary service to interest all their women with a desire to attend theology testimony meetings. The worth of testimony is great. May we be blessed with faith that God is still at the helm of this great nation. Let us have faith in the leadership of our Church. Let us strive to keep the principles and teachings of the gospel. May our testimonies be strengthened and may we be a light and an inspiration to others through our living the gospel and expressing in testimony our faith and gratitude, I pray, in the name of Jesus. Our Pioneer Heritage Ann P, Nibley Member, Relief Society General Board THE visiting teachers' department, during the years 1946- 47, deals with the general subject "Our Pioneer Heritage." This is a timely subject, inasmuch as we shall celebrate this year the one hundreth anniversary of the arrival of the first Mormon pioneers in Salt Lake Valley. Sister Amy Brown Lyman is the author of these lessons, and she has ably treated the subject under the following headings: Love of God; Love of Fellow Man; Faith; Courage; Industry; Self-reliance; Dependability; and Thirst for Knowledge. I shall attempt to review these lessons for you in the brief time allotted to me. First, the love of God. This quality is, indeed, one of the cardinal virtues, for did not the Savior say: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself" (Matthew 22:37-39). The early Latter-day Saints manifested their love of God when they accepted the gospel and became members of the Church, for Mormonism, at the time, was so misrepresented and abused that it was a very unpopular religion. The love of fellow man was a noble characteristic of the pioneers. It was this fraternal feeling that prompted all the missionary work that was performed during the early days of the Church. The truths of the gospel, which they prized so highly, they wished to share with others, and so they went forth, without purse or scrip, enduring all manner of personal hardships, in order that they might make known to their fellow men the saving principles which had been revealed from heaven to the Prophet Joseph Smith. Faith, the ability to believe in the visions and inspired teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, was another of the great attributes possessed by the pioneers. Their faith was genuine and real, as real as life itself. They believed with heart and soul that God had revealed himself, and that his kingdom had been again established upon earth. Courage, which is born of faith, is another admirable characteristic of the pioneers. It required supreme courage for 20,000 Latter-day Saints to leave their comfortable homes in Nauvoo, and journey into the western wilderness, in the most inclement season of the year. They were courageous when they allowed five hundred of their young, strong men to enlist in the army, to fight the battles of their country against Mexico, leaving their wives and children, mothers and fathers, stranded in an Indian country, living in wagons and tents, on the banks of the Missouri river. They were brave and courageous when they began the journey to Utah, with inferior equipment and meager supplies; a journey over deserts and mountain ranges, which consumed more than three months time. And when they began to build a city and a temple in the barren Salt Lake Valley,. Their courage was sublime. Another lesson we may learn from these remarkable people is the lesson of industry. The entire history of the Latter-day Saints testifies that wherever they have settled they have been diligent and industrious. In Utah, the beehive was early adopted as the State emblem, signifying a busy, diligent, and self-sustaining people. The teachings of Brigham Young, during the thirty years that he presided over the saints in the valleys, was to the effect that all who were able should sustain themselves by some useful work. The genius of the Welfare Plan, now being stressed throughout the Church, is that the Latter-day Saints should all be engaged in useful work and, through their labors, sustain themselves. Self-reliance is another prominent characteristic of our pioneer forefathers. This valuable and important attribute was largely developed through the persecutions that were heaped upon them. For many years "every man's hand" was against them, and, finally, they were driven into the western desert where they had to be self-reliant in order to survive. Dependability was a notable trait of the early settlers of these valleys. They were taught to be dependable in all their dealings, and in every walk of life. Frequently, they were called by the Presidency of the Church to leave comfortable homes in Salt Lake City, and move to out-  GENERAL RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE lying settlements, such as St. George, the Muddy River in Nevada, Cache Valley, or the Salmon River in Idaho. No one was expected to refuse such a call they were to be dependable and carry out the instructions of those who were placed in authority to preside over them. Dependability in private matters was also to be observed, such as the payment of debts, the return of articles which had been borrowed, and the keeping of appointments. "Thirst for Knowledge" is the title given to the eighth lesson in this course, and Sister Lyman fittingly 35 points out that the high ideals for education in the Church have come about through the stimulating precepts given through the Prophet Joseph Smith, such as the following: "A man is saved no faster than he gains knowledge," and "The glory of God is intelligence" (Doc. & Cov. 93:30). Surely then, of all people, " should hold the quest for knowledge uppermost in our minds. We trust that our visiting teachers will find joy and satisfaction in carrying these messages to the membership of their various organizations throughout the Church. The Sewing Course Velma N. Simonsen Member, Relief Society General Board THIS year we are presenting to you our new course in home sewing, for optional use at work meetings. It is optional with each ward whether they teach this course or not, but we feel that it is so timely, and should be of such great worth to our sisters, that we hope every ward and branch in the Church will have one of these sewing classes in their units. We hope that no stake or ward president, will decide, in and of herself, that there is no need for the class in her ward or stake. As long as there is one member, or one potential member, of the Relief Society, who does not know how to sew, then there is a need for that class, and a need for you to get that person interested in the class. One of the possibilities that we see for the course is to increase the sewing abilities of our sisters, and especially of our young mothers who have small families for whom to sew. And, aside from the economic value and help that the sisters will receive in learning to sew, there is a joy and a satisfaction that comes from the ability to create. Another thing we think will be very fine is the bringing of new interest into our work-day meeting and, therefore, getting greater participation among the sisters. It could be a means of increasing membership, and especially in interesting those young people, young mothers in our wards, who are not now receiving the blessings of membership in the Relief Society. We hope, too, that it will possibly improve the quality of our Welfare sewing. And, as you progress in the course, I am sure that you will see many more possibilities the course 36 will have to offer for improving and benefiting and strengthening the women of your wards and your ward organizations. Again I say, much as we hope that every ward and branch will have the course, will teach a class in home sewing, it is entirely optional with the ward. Do not make it a formal lesson period for all the women who attend work meeting. It is not to take the place of the other activities of that day. These activities will go on just the same, the Welfare sewing, quilting, rug making, or the art work, needle and handicraft, and all the activities that have been recommended for use on that day. Encourage each ward to have the textbook. The textbook that has been chosen, we feel, is a very valuable help in teaching these sewing lessons. Have the sewing leaders familiarize themselves with the index, for there they will find many helpful suggestions and helps other than those that are printed as references in the Magazine. Owing to the lack of space, we are not able to print a great deal of help in the Magazine, but this book (The Complete Book of Sewing) you will find to be very, very valuable. There are other pamphlets and booklets available, also, that will be of use in teaching these lessons. The instructor, or sewing leader, need not be a professional seamstress. To be a good home sewer is all that is required. The Gospel as a Way of Life Priscilla L. Evans Member, Relief Society General Board FEW years ago, I stood with my husband and two young missionaries at the pier in New York City, awaiting the docking of an ocean liner which was returning to this country seventy missionaries of our Church seventy among the many who had been recalled from their labors in foreign lands. It was a very large ship, and was filled to its utmost capacity. Following a well-arranged and successful procedure (for these missionaries were among the last to arrive), we had presented our passes and were standing in a space assigned to us near the gate. Several baggage carts were beside us and two dock hands had been assigned to assist us. By the time the gangplank was securely anchored, and the gate opened, one of our dock hands had made his way to the opened gate. He stood quietly at the gate as this mass of humanity surged past him. But, as each missionary passed him, he touched him on the shoulder and said simply: "Here, Elder, this way. Your mission president is right over there." Soon, all seventy were with us, their baggage piled high in the carts. He had not missed one, though they were scattered through the crowd, and wore no identification. GENERAL RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE When he came to rejoin us, I said, "How in the world could you recognize all of those missionaries?" He looked at me intently for an instant, and replied, respectfully, "Well, I really don't know, ma'am  they're different!" Now, this man did not see this "difference" with his physical eyes, but felt it with his spiritual senses. This "difference" did not come from superior mental attainments, nor from physical prowess, nor from economic status, but from a spiritual strength. All over the world, wherever missionaries have labored, humble, superior, God-fearing men and women have felt this "difference" and have been attracted to the missionary. They observe his manner of living and his attitude toward good and evil. They see, at first, only a behavior pattern which is very desirable. But, little by little, as they become acquainted with the missionary, and hear from his lips the first principles of the gospel' plan, they are aware that the behavior which attracted them is but a reflection of this inner light, this spiritual strength, which the blessings of the gospel have conferred upon this young emissary. The spirit of God bears testimony to them of the truthfulness of the gospel, and they are baptized and confirmed members of the Church. Their confirmation - bestows upon them the gift of the Holy Ghost, and, with this gift, comes a burning desire to fully understand the truths of this great cause which they have espoused. In the early years of the Church, in these valleys, when all of the saints were comparatively recent converts 37 from other religious faiths, there was evident the same eager desire to fully understand the gospel plan, to live up to its responsibilities, and to receive its blessings. In the missions, the members desire, above all else, to learn the fundamental doctrines of the gospel. Associations have been known to use a doctrinal course year after year, not minding the repetition, for each year they have recognized new truths, or have learned to apply the truths better to their individual lives. For use in the present year, a purely doctrinal course of lessons has been prepared. These lessons are designed, primarily, for the mission branches, made up of comparatively new converts members such as I have just described. It is anticipated that all of the associations in the foreign missions will use this course for the reason that the present year's literature lessons, "America, as Revealed in Its Literature," may not be attractive to them, as it is hardly appropriate for their use. And there will be branches in the missions in this country, and some wards in the stakes, which will find these optional lessons better suited to their needs. "The Gospel as a Way of Life" is the subject of the course. The lessons, written by Elder T. Edgar Lyon, are simple and_ teachable (Dr. Lyon is a teacher in our Church schools), and are replete with illustrations of common experience. References are confined to the standard works of the Church. This is for the -reason that these books are available to the members in foreign lands, translated into their own language. This course is devoted to the first principles of the gospel; to faith, repentance, baptism, and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. The final lessons have to do with the fruits of the gospel, the last one being devoted to the abundant life, meaning a life abundant with righteousness, in service to fellow men, and in obedience to the laws of God. It will be apparent that these lessons will attain their objective to strengthen the members in the knowledge of the fundamentals of the gospel plan, to make them more serene and sure in their faith. This will give them a spiritual strength, especially in their homes, that nothing else can give, for they will be strengthened in patience, forgiveness, humility, courage in the face of trials, and in kindness. The influence upon their growing children will be one of the greatest gifts to come to them from this knowledge of the gospel. For only in the home can the moral and religious virtues be ingrained into the lives of children. This simple, teachable, faith-promoting course is designed to help us to so make the gospel a part of us, that beauty, morality, and spirituality will be present in our surroundings, and become a part of our daily lives. May God bless us all in our efforts to interpret the gospel in the lives of the women of the Church, that all the world may be led to say of us, "Yes, they are different." Congregational Singing and Song Practice Blanche B. Stoddard Member, Relief Society General Board 66 HE hymns we sing, speak what we are and what we believe. Faith and sorrow, hope and courage, trust and obedience, joy and thanksgiving  all are spoken from the heart in the song." The Lord himself acclaimed the power of music when, in July 1830, he gave a revelation through the Prophet Joseph Smith, directed to Emma Smith, in which he told her she was to make a selection of sacred hymns: For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads (Doc. And Cov. 25:12).   I wonder if we realize that, for a few of our sisters, the only time they bear testimonies is in congregational singing. So, should not good congregational singing be an integral part of our Relief Society program? Do you choristers and organists realize how important you are? The first requisite, of course, is enthusiasm. There is no substitute for that. I have in mind one Relief Society chorister who shows her enthusiasm by standing before her congregation without a book. She knows her songs, and sings them because she loves them, so we cannot help but join in. I am sure she studies ahead of time the songs she is to conduct.  GENERAL RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE I think we are too haphazard. For instance, in how many of our meetings do we see the presiding officer and the chorister hurriedly thumbing through the song book at one minute to two, trying to decide on an opening song? If the teacher for that day had waited until 2:20 to decide what she would give in her lesson, we could expect a very poor presentation, couldn't we? Why should not the chorister feel just as keenly her responsibility? _ We suggest that the ward preparation meeting be the time to select the songs for every meeting of the month. The songs and the lessons should correlate, as should any special numbers to be given. Then, at this meeting, the chorister and organist and class leaders should make their selections together. The lesson work this year, especially in the literature course, will provide a splendid opportunity for correlation with the music. During the month, the organist will have a chance to practice, if necessary, and the chorister can use time valuably in studying the words and time of these songs, and really interpret them for the edification of the Relief Society membership. The success of good congregational singing is in having everyone follow the leader. And so, the leader must know definitely where she is going. We hope sisters, that our singing will be "worshipful singing." In other words, we hope that the message of our songs will be the thing we want to get out of them. Samuel Smedley wrote the words of "I Know That My Redeemer Lives" about 1789. It was my privilege to know very well the composer of the music as we now have it in 39 our hymn book. Brother Louis D. Edwards was a contemporary and very dear friend of Evan Stephens. He composed many of our Sunday School songs, among them "Hark, Listen to the 'Trumpeters." He moved to my home town, La Grande, Oregon, about 1915, and conducted our stake choir for many years. I was fortunate enough to be his organist. He always wrote a special accompaniment for the hymns and anthems we sang, so I learned many fine lessons from him  not all regarding music. He wore his gray hair long on his shoulders and had piercing black eyes, as I imagine the Apostle Paul had, and his testimony was just as powerful as Paul's. We sang "I Know That My Redeemer Lives" at his funeral in 1921. Do you see, sisters, what we mean when we say "worshipful singing?" We hope Relief Society presidents are giving the choristers time for song practice twice each month. We suggest that this be carefully prepared and worked out by the chorister and organist. We hope, also, that you will teach new songs. We are in a rut, I am afraid, and choose the line of least resistance in singing the same songs over and over. During song practice, analyze the words of the song, as has been suggested, and give the setting and background of the composition. Let all of the sisters learn the soprano part first, then those who read readily can hear the alto. The important thing is that every one shall participate, and that song practice shall be looked forward to with anticipation; a time when no one shall be denied expression; a time for testimonies to be sung. Get the habit of singing all of the song. Usually, it takes all the verses to convey the message. To avoid monotony, perhaps you would not have an interlude between every verse, only between the second and third. The organist, in her preparation, may learn a variation in interludes, not necessarily just repeating the last two or three measures. I don't believe I have mentioned the importance of the organist. I want to emphasize that now. She can make of a song a ragged, unpleasant thing, or a smooth-flowing, melodious thing. Sisters, don't ever say, "I am just the organist or chorister in Relief Society." Say, "I am the chorister in Relief Society, and I am going to make my work as outstanding and - lovely and educational as any other part of the Relief Society program. I am going to be indispensable in the success of my entire organization." The Importance of Music in Relief Society Florence J. Madsen Member, Relief Society General Board LET us ponder how important is the music in Church services. This is a question we all should ask ourselves. The experience of all conscientious leaders in Church activity indicates and justifies the conclusion that the music is fundamentally essential in all progressive, significant, and vital services. In fact, without the complement of music, very often the intent of worship would be very much like the letter without the spirit, and would fail to stir the worshiper with a consciousness of the values and beauties of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and the message of the prophets. "Yea," as Longfellow says, "music is the prophet's art; among the gifts that God hath sent, one of the most magnificent." Now, we still cling to that. We feel that music comes from him and is a gift to us. The human voice is the one instrument that we have been given. God made it, not man. All other instruments are man-made. Consider that. The same instrument you speak with, you sing with, so don't say you can't sing. I am sure that all of us, as Relief Society workers, realize that this is a fact, and that we are anxious to increase our contributions toward the constant availability of musical resources, that our religious services shall, in the future, be richer with appeals and interests than they have been in the past. The question now arises, What can we do to make this desired and necessary musical availability certain? It seems to me, that we must emphasize certain underlying principles and steps of procedure. The first of these, I feel, should be a complete and dynamic conversion to the necessity and value of music in relation to the Church, generally, and the Relief Society program, particularly.  GENERAL RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE Conversion in anything is necessary. You, who sometimes have very little talent, if you can be converted to the thing you are trying to do, you will do it well because you will seek, and seeking, you will find it; and you will knock, and in knocking, it will be opened unto you. Do not feel that you have to have exceptional gifts to be an organizer and conductor of a singing group. If, however, you have some special gift in this line, it will aid you materially. There are mechanics to music, and most anyone who puts forth the effort can learn them. Don't ever -tell your children, those roundabout you who are trying to sing or trying to play, not to sing or play, that they have no talent. Don't ever say that. Let them use any melody they want to use. Sometimes it is a while before a child is able to sing in tune. Music is one of the finest cultural arts we know, and it is a thing that many of us can express at the same time, Now, if you can just absorb some of these things, I know you can go into your wards and into your stakes, and you can organize and begin to move forward. And that is our thought now, in this Centennial year. Transportation is not such a problem, and we do want our Singing Mothers' organizations to function. I have been able to be out and hear a few of them in our conventions, and I have been delighted with the work. Sometimes the groups are very large, sometimes they are small. Let us try and see if we can bring in all the women who want to sing, and then see if we can have something to give them when they come. 41 After we have decided that we are definitely converted to the great power of music, and we have agreed that music is the handmaid of religion, and a great power for good, then, I would suggest an adequate musical preparation. We need that just as much as we need these lessons. We need our textbooks. We must have something we can refer to. If you read music now, learn to read it better. Take the printed page of music, and don't feel that it is a stranger to you, that you can't read it. It takes so little to have a fervent appreciation of music, to discriminate properly between musical values, and to be able to conduct music intelligently, and with due artistry. This, naturally, involves some well-planned and systematic study and training, and, in order to secure such help, we should seek out teachers who are competent to give us the necessary instruction. Such teachers are not necessarily in remote places, but may be found in your own neighborhood. Also, such training need not be expensive. What about the school music teacher in your town? He would gladly share his learning with you, and, perhaps, just for the asking. You choristers are working with groups, mature and young; people who have sung, and people who, perhaps, have gone for years without singing. We have that group. Then, we have the young ones who have not sung much, and who really make a lovely group. I like some younger singers with the more mature singers. In maturity, we have the body of tone; in the younger singers, we have the freshness of tone. How can we blend these groups? 42 Our voices, in a sense, are as individual as our faces are. How are we going to help them, and how are we going to blend them in a common tone, something that we can all plan and work toward, and that will come out beautifully? This year, I hope you can get your groups together and plan something. You all can do that. There will be music mentioned in yourThere was some ' in the December Magazine for 1942. In choosing your songs, choose something that has some goodness to it, and there are good things, not all such simple things. Don't keep your repertoire down to such simple things all the time. Let's do things a little harder let's progress. I know you people can do that, in part rehearsal. I'm stressing that part rehearsal. Don't have all sopranos. When you come to making your chorus, just simply say, "I've got to have so many altos; I've got to have so many sopranos." 'Try and get some of these younger people who are coming into Relief Society. They need you and you need them. RECEPTION FOR STAKE AND MISSION OFFICERS AND BOARD MEMBERS Wednesday Evening, October 2, 1946 Receiving line, left to right: General Secretary-Treasurer, Margaret C. Pickering; Second Counselor, Gertrude R. Garff; First Counselor Marianne C. Sharp; General President Belle S. Spafford; Board member, Leone G. Layton.. GENERAL RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE 43 OFFICERS' MEETING, OCTOBER 3, 1946 Report and Official Instructions President Belle S. Spafford SISTERS, we are very pleased to S greet this large gathering of Relief Society women again this morning and to bid you welcome to this meeting. We have a few figures from the annual report that we wish to bring to your attention, in order that you may better understand the trend that the various phases of this organization are taking, and that you may understand the phases of the program which, perhaps, require special attention during the coming year. The annual report for 1945 reveals that we now have Relief Society organizations in every state in the Union. Membership The membership figures for 1945 disturb us just a little, in that they show a loss of 371 members, with the total membership of the Society at the close of 1945 as 101,691. This loss in membership we attribute to the fact that many organizations which were meeting on Sunday, which was a war-time expedient, have changed, and are now meeting on a weekday. We wish you to know that we approve the weekday meeting. We feel that more advantages come to the women when they meet on a weekday. Another thing that has interfered with our membership has been the population shift due to the close of the war. We have had some losses, also, from deaths and resignations, and a few losses from names being removed from the rolls, names of inactive members. Now, you do have the privilege, sisters, of removing names from the rolls under certain circumstances, but we hope that you will only exercise this privilege according to the rules set down by the General Board. It is a very serious thing to remove the name of a Latter-day Saint woman from a Relief Society roll. It should never be done without her full knowledge and full consent, and following a personal visit to her by the president or someone appointed by the president. We feel that there is opportunity for increasing our Relief Society membership. It is presumed that there is at least one woman eligible for Relief Society membership in each family of the Church. There ~ are 61,660 Latter-day Saint families in the stakes of Zion not represented in Relief Society, and we wish that special attention be given to these women who are not enrolled. We also wish that you would give special attention to the young women, the brides, who are just beginning to establish homes, and who need to build their homes on the foundation of Latter-day Saint standards. We hope that you will bring these young women into the organization. They need Relief Society and Relief Society needs them. Visiting Teaching We are very happy to report to you that there is an upturn in our visiting-teaching program. Everywhere we note an increased interest in the work and an improved attitude toward it, and the figures also show an improvement in our visiting teaching. As a matter of fact, we had 7.2 visits to Latter-day Saint homes out of a possible 12. We think this is a fairly good record and it is particularly gratifying in that it shows an improvement over the year before. Sewing Program The educational courses were well received during 1945, with our class leaders doing excellent work. The Society, through the medium of the work meeting, carried forward an extensive sewing program. But only one-third of the women of our organization participated in the sewing program. This is disturbing to us in that it doesn't represent enough women doing the sewing, and this figure has persisted for two or three years. We hope that you will make concentrated effort to bring more women into the sewing program. We hope that you will do a great deal to teach the young women to sew. This is our responsibility as Relief Society workers. The goal of this Society is to have every member gain the training, and experience, the joy and satisfaction that come from participating in our sewing program. Compassionate Service Our compassionate services have enlisted the attention of thousands of women, and a great deal of creditable work has been done. However, this is another phase of our program that we feel we could expand with profit. We hope that you will give special attention during the coming year to the compassionate services which are so much needed today. European Relief ' During the month of December in 1945, the Society, in support of the Church Welfare Plan, participated in an extensive relief program for the aid of the destitute Latter-day Saints in European countries. This participation included contribution by Relief Society of a total of 7,200 blankets and quilts. We also contributed 47,173 bars of soap to this program, and the sisters assisted in the collection, sorting, mending and packing of 562,279 articles of good, used clothing for distribution to the European saints. The Relief Society General Board sincerely appreciates the work that you sisters did in support of the European relief program. You not only rendered good service, but you rendered it in the spirit of willing service. You seemed happy to do it, and we were grateful for that. Annual Report I hope that you will look at the annual report published in the September issue of Thestudy it carefully, sisters. It has been prepared in a new and very interesting style by our General Secretary Margaret Pickering. Participation in Other Programs Now, several questions have come into the office during recent months which we wish to answer for you here this morning. We have had numerous requests regarding the participation of our organization in health and other programs, worthy programs, which are wholly, or partially supported by funds other than Church funds. We have been advised by Church authorities that Relief Society, as an organization, should not undertake to promote such programs, that the members of Relief Society might help individually as you did during war-time in support of the American Red Cross. GENERAL RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE Participation of Girls in Welfare Sewing The handbook for leaders of Latter-day Saint girls indicates that in working toward the standard group award that girls participate in Church Welfare projects. Relief Society presidents have evidenced some concern regarding turning over to the girls Welfare sewing assigned to the Society which requires supervision Or sewing experience, since the girls, in most instances, cannot attend our regular Relief Society work meetings where such supervision is given, and since they do not themselves have a meeting where Relief Society workers could go and give them the directions that they need in preparing these articles. We are advised by the Presiding Bishopric that it is not expected that the girls share the Welfare sewing, requiring technical sewing skill, unless you can provide some supervision for them. But, sisters, there is much sewing assigned to us by the Church Welfare Program which does not require technical skill, and we feel that it would be a fine thing to share this sewing with the girls. The participation of the girls in the Welfare sewing would be encouraging to them, and I think, too, it would be good training looking toward their eventual membership in our organization, and it would also bring them close to the Church Welfare Program. So if you have sewing that you can release to 5 them, we think it would be a splendid thing to do. Quilting Rates Quilt-making is both traditional and extensive in Relief Society, and thousands of quilts are made annually for various purposes. Relief Society women give willingly of their time in quilting for the needy, and for co-operative, help-one-another quilting projects. They also give of their time in quilting to earn funds for the local Society by the quilts being sold at bazaars, or for individual orders, for example, where people order a quilt for their own use. The women give their time in this service. Obviously, Relief Society members should not be expected to give service on quilting for individuals who can afford to pay for this serv. Ice at rates which yield too little income for the organization in proportion to the quilt-making service. Now, we don't want to be misunderstood; you should not charge prices that are too high. We want you to give full value in sewing, or any other type of service, in this organization. We stand for that. But I wish to give you this little example to illustrate why we bring this before this meeting. In one ward a quilt was made for a woman living in a neighboring state. It was reported to me by her stake president that at least 204 hours were required to quilt this quilt, with thirty-five women participating at different times. Had one woman made the quilt, it would have required her working seven hours a day for thirty days. The Society charged $8.00 for the quilting service. Now, the women give their service to the organization, but it his the responsibility of Relief Society officers to direct this fine service contribution of the women along the most economical and profitable lines to the Society. You have a responsibility to utilize this contributed service in the most necessary and profitable way. We call this to your attention for that purpose. Now, some of you have asked about quilting prices. We refer you to The Relief Society. Magazine, September 1944, page 526, for suggested prices. Missionary Work Not Relief Society Responsibility Since the opening up of missionary work, following the release of so many of our young people from war service, a number of Relief Society presidents have asked for advice as to whether or not Relief Society should collect funds or use funds which they may have on hand to support a missionary in the field. Relief Society has not been assigned the responsibility of keeping missionaries in the field. It appears that the work assigned to us is so great in scope that Relief Society should not assume added responsibilities, Relief Society Building Last year the Relief Society women in the general session of our conference voted to support the General Board in a building program, in the erection of a Relief Society build: ing in Salt Lake City. Due to circumstances over which we have had no control, we have up to date been unable to go forward with our build. Ing program. However, as soon as definite plans are worked out and approved, you will be advised. Scope of Relief Society Work Sisters, the work of Relief Society is a great and a mighty work. It is the work assigned by the Church to the women of the Church. It takes the diligence, it takes the ability, it takes the prayer, it takes the faith, it takes the understanding of everyone of you to carry it forward, and it is the prayer of my heart that everyone of us will be endowed by our Heavenly Father with the requirements necessary to carry forward the work, and that we will experience the joy and the satisfaction that come from serving our Heavenly Father and keeping his commandments. And may he bless you in the work to which you are called, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.
