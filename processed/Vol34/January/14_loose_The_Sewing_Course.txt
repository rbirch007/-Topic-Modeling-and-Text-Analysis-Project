The Sewing Course Velma N. Simonsen Member, Relief Society General Board THIS year we are presenting to you our new course in home sewing, for optional use at work meetings. It is optional with each ward whether they teach this course or not, but we feel that it is so timely, and should be of such great worth to our sisters, that we hope every ward and branch in the Church will have one of these sewing classes in their units. We hope that no stake or ward president, will decide, in and of herself, that there is no need for the class in her ward or stake. As long as there is one member, or one potential member, of the Relief Society, who does not know how to sew, then there is a need for that class, and a need for you to get that person interested in the class. One of the possibilities that we see for the course is to increase the sewing abilities of our sisters, and especially of our young mothers who have small families for whom to sew. And, aside from the economic value and help that the sisters will receive in learning to sew, there is a joy and a satisfaction that comes from the ability to create. Another thing we think will be very fine is the bringing of new interest into our work-day meeting and, therefore, getting greater participation among the sisters. It could be a means of increasing membership, and especially in interesting those young people, young mothers in our wards, who are not now receiving the blessings of membership in the Relief Society. We hope, too, that it will possibly improve the quality of our Welfare sewing. And, as you progress in the course, I am sure that you will see many more possibilities the course 36 will have to offer for improving and benefiting and strengthening the women of your wards and your ward organizations. Again I say, much as we hope that every ward and branch will have the course, will teach a class in home sewing, it is entirely optional with the ward. Do not make it a formal lesson period for all the women who attend work meeting. It is not to take the place of the other activities of that day. These activities will go on just the same, the Welfare sewing, quilting, rug making, or the art work, needle and handicraft, and all the activities that have been recommended for use on that day. Encourage each ward to have the textbook. The textbook that has been chosen, we feel, is a very valuable help in teaching these sewing lessons. Have the sewing leaders familiarize themselves with the index, for there they will find many helpful suggestions and helps other than those that are printed as references in the Magazine. Owing to the lack of space, we are not able to print a great deal of help in the Magazine, but this book (The Complete Book of Sewing) you will find to be very, very valuable. There are other pamphlets and booklets available, also, that will be of use in teaching these lessons. The instructor, or sewing leader, need not be a professional seamstress. To be a good home sewer is all that is required.
