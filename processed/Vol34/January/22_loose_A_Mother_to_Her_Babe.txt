A MOTHER TO HER BABE Roxana Farnsworth Hase 1 cannot feel that I have lived in vain, Nor do I mind the hours of bitter pain Now I behold you, feel you in my arms, And know the lovely beauty that conforms The sweet perfection that is yours today. No matter what may come, years far away, Now you are mine, straight from beauty's realm And I am glad that I am at the helm Of your frail bark to chart your course awhile, To start you on your trip around Time's dial. You are the product of my yesteryears, You hold my ideals, longings, hopes, and fears. I see in you my plan of life fulfilled, I build you castles no one else could build, Then hold you close; all else seems far away  I dream my dreams...for you are mine today. Page 51 Faith Is a Heritage Christie Lund Coles CHAPTER 10 S time went on, Enid made A up, in every way possible, to Sharon for the lonely little girl years. 'There were barbecue suppers in the back yard, buffet suppers for the crowd, more formal dinners. It did something to Sharon to know that she belonged, to know that she could carry her end in all her social contacts, that she needn't be afraid to accept an invitation for fear she couldn't return it properly. Enid tried to give her the good things. At the same time, she had to help her keep a sense of the greater values. Sometimes, Enid wasn't too sure she was succeeding. Sharon was $0 alive, so full of fun, and she seemed to expect too much from life. Was she prepared to return in full for other things, as she did for the social obligations? It was hard for Enid to judge, as she had had the entire responsibility of rearing Sharon. Yet, all seemed well. Sharon was selected valedictorian of her high school class, which seemed to Enid to be a signal honor. She ached with pride in this tall, beautifully poised young woman, who so recently had been her baby. On the night before' the graduation exercises, Enid sat stitching on the white tulle with its delicate pink and blue embroidery. As she finished the last, tiny stitch, she laid the dress carefully over a large chair where Sharon would see it first thing when she came from the party. Enid didn't wait up for her any more. Page 52 Keeping house, teaching, entertaining, drained too much of her strength. Besides, she knew her daughter resented, just a little, her sitting up, and, after all, Sharon didn't need to be watched; she could be depended upon to do the night thing. Tonight, however, Enid would have liked to have waited up for Sharon, to have seen her when she picked up the billowy white dress, to have heard her exclamation. Enid wanted very much to have a heart-to-heart talk with her, to know what the girl planned to say tomorrow in her speech. Enid wondered if she were a little jealous because life was taking Sharon away from her so much of the time, a little jealous that Sharon had prepared this speech without any help, any suggestions. They had been so close, always, that it seemed impossible now that there could be any gulf between them, anything unshared. Enid decided that she wasn't jealous, that she just wanted to be sure she had done a good job, so that whatever might happen to Sharon, she would have something within her that would give her the strength to meet life. The next day, as she helped Sharon get ready, Enid was patient with her in her excitement and nervous ness. "On, Mother," cried Sharon, "I'm scared to death. I�ll never get through this... I just won't ever." FAITH IS A HERITAGE Enid said something which she had told herself she would not say, hoping to be too anxious. Her hesitation if first, "Don't . . . don't you think you should read me your speech, let me hear how it sounds before you give it? You've been so secretive about it."
Sharon avoided meeting her mother's eyes, pretended interest in the way her skirt fell about her hips. "I'd rather not, Mother . . . if you don't mind. You come up there and hear it."
"All right . . . if that's how you want it. But we haven't ever had any secrets, don't let's start."
"This isn't a secret, Mom. It's just . . . Oh, I can't tell you."
Her young face was so pained that Enid smiled at her reassuringly, "Forget it. And hurry! Run will be here to pick you up in a few minutes."
"You like him, don't you? You think he's nice?"
"Yes, I like him very much, but I don't want you to get too serious."
"We won't . . . not for a few years. You can be sure of that."
Later, Enid dressed and went to the commencement exercises. She saw Mr. Fletcher sitting on the stand. He was to be one of the speakers. Enid knew that since she had given him a definite "no" for an answer, he had been courting a widow from a neighboring town, but it didn't mean anything to her. Even with the loneliness of her life crowding upon her, she knew that there could be nothing between them. She had known something so real, so wonderful, once, that she could not be satisfied with something inferior.
SHE took her seat as near the front as she dared to sit without appearing to be too anxious. Her heart was pounding harder than if she herself were to deliver the address. She kept praying that Sharon would do all right, would not be too nervous.
She was startled from her thoughts by a voice beside her saying, "Hello. Do you remember me?"
She looked up to see the tall figure of Mr. Richards, Billy Richard's father, who had visited her at school the day Miss Nobbit had died. "Of course I do," she assured him, putting her hand rather spontaneously into his, "How are you?"
"Wonderful," he beamed upon her, "are you saving this seat for anyone special?"
"Not unless it is for you," she told him, feeling young and gay for the first time in ages. "Sit down."
He talked to her freely until the program started, and told her they had discovered a rather rare mineral on his farm, which might mean a great deal to him. "Of course, I'll keep on farming," he said, "it's sort of in my blood. I like the look of the earth, new-turned by a plow, the first green showing above it. I like to get out at sunrise and look at the quiet and beautiful world on all sides of me, to feel myself part of it . . ."
"Why, you're a poet," she murmured, delighted, "you could convert a whole city full of people to becoming farmers with such language."
"Maybe I could convert you to coming out to see it. I've thought of you many times since that day. But . . . I didn't dare ask you for a date. I heard you were going with Mr. Fletcher. Then, just the other day, I heard he was going to marry some woman from out of town . . ." "Is he? I hope he'll be happy," she replied. 'Then she turned back toward the stage. "Sh..." she whispered, "they're going to begin." The first part of the program did not register much with Enid because of the excitement of waiting for Sharon, of seeing her on the stand, her slender hands folded in her lap, her head held high. Then, it was time for Sharon's speech. She came forward rather slowly. No one would have dreamed that she was frightened, but Enid knew by the way she steadied herself with her hand on the small table. Her words began, they flowed out, thoughtful, sincere, beautiful words. She said, in part, "We do not ask an easy life, we ask, instead, strength for a hard one if it comes. We ask courage and faith similar to that which those we love have shown through all the years that we have known them. "We are the new leaf upon which will be written the story of our generation. We are not so different from those who have gone before us. We ask only to be worthy of their approbation, only to be deserving of their faith. For faith is the greatest heritage which anyone can receive.' Enid felt the tears sting her eyes. She remembered saying those words to her daughter. The words about faith being a heritage. Sharon had remembered. Enid felt sure she would always remember. She knew now why Sharon hadn't wanted to read the speech to her. It lay too close to her heart, too intimate. Youth had a pride that recoiled from revealing the best that was in them for fear it might appear as a weakness. But it was there, just the same Enid knew. Here, in these words, was the answer to all her questions, the recompense for all her years, fulfillment of her prayers. Wherever Tom was, she felt that he could see and hear and understand. She was sure his 'spirit had been with her all the way. The diplomas were given out, people began to leave. Bill Richards stepped back to let her go before him. He seemed not to notice her tears, and said only, "You've done a good job." She smiled at him tremulously. He knew, as only one who had shared a similar experience could know. She appreciated his words. They walked out together and met Sharon at the door. Enid couldn't _ find words to speak, neither could her daughter. They merely looked at one another and the tears welled from their bright, bright eyes. Bill Richards said, "It's stuffy in here. Maybe you and your daughter would like to drive out to my farm and have some homemade ice cream." Sharon wrinkled her nose at him, "O-h, boy! We certainly would. Can Ray go along?" "Bring anybody you want," he assured her, good-naturedly, "We'll be out front." They drove west of town, saw the green, lush fields, the tall poplars bordering the road, the streams that gurgled and sang over the rocks as though repeating the words, �God's in his 'heaven, all's right with the world." Enid smiled to herself-in complete contentment, in utter, joyous peace. She knew that, as the past had been good, the future, too, would be taken care of, would be rich and full. If she kept her heritage of faith. The End  DEPARTMEN Theology  Church History Lesson 23 Unsung Heroes in Zion's Cause Elder H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, April 1, 1947 Objective: To appreciate the countless unheralded men and women who have stood firm within the Church, to move forward the work of the Lord. UTAH'S centennial year 1947 has come in with marked celebrations. 'Thousands of dollars will be spent to bring to mind again the men and women who crossed the plains to build their Zion. The leaders and colonizers of the great Latter-day Saint State will be fittingly eulogized, and monuments of lasting beauty will rise to tell their story. All this should be, for every cause must have great men to lead. Yet, too, in every movement, there must be those who follow in faith and devotion. It is to these unsung heroes in Zion's cause that we now most fittingly, in the year of 1947, pause to pay tribute. Their number is legion, their modest deeds and virtues countless, and without them, there could have been no kingdom of the Lord established. Unlike the other lessons in this series, this lesson will not have questions and readings for discussion. Rather, it is suggested that the hour should be spent in recalling faith promoting stories that certainly abound in every Latter-day Saint home. For those classes which do not have the older saints, it is suggested that stimulating stories of the early settlers of Utah, recorded in biographical form, be assigned for telling on the day this lesson is given. It is hoped, however, that in every ward and branch Relief Society there may be found the individual stories of a local nature, which may, on this day, herald the unsung stories of men and women, whose deeds the Lord has faithfully recorded for reward. For an example of the stories that are sure to be found for such a lesson as this, the following heretofore unwritten account of William Terry of Draper, Utah, is given: On the pleasant countryside of Rhode Island some hundred years ago, two young hearts found companionship. The boy answered to the name of William, the girl befittingly was known as Mary, They were married. She then became a Terry, and only on occasion referred to her maiden name of Phillips. These two young people proudly traced their line back to the Mayflower stock of New England. Serious in deportment were they, for the Lord's Page 55 word had ever been a part of their up. Bringing. Not many of the happy years of their married life had passed before Latter-day Saint missionaries found them and their then small family of girls, Wholeheartedly, these two embraced the faith and set out for a land unknown, which God had set aside for his people. Ere their journey to the mountains was completed, another little girl was born, who was given her mother's name. When William and Ma finally looked upon the promised land, their eyes were filled with tears. Before them lay a dry and burning stretch of earth. "Sage, sage, sage," spoke William. "Mary, if it weren't for my religion, I'd yoke these oxen again and turn them back to New England." But they went on, and obedient to their leader's call, settled south against the sheltering upland of the Wasatch Range, to help found the town now known as Drap.- er, Utah. There were many hard years ahead, years of cold and hunger, before the green fields of wheat and corm blossomed in the valley sun. One winter, father William had but little food for his family. The flour sacks were empty by the time the early March winds cut through the cabin. One day, as this good man went forth to open the ditches along his acres, his youngest daughter Mary, with childlike love, saw the pain of hunger in his face. Lovingly, she found the flour sacks and set about to dust them for every precious sift. Her patience was rewarded, for by afternoon, she had enough to make two small johnnycakes, When evening came her father did not return. At first, there was no alarm, for it was thought he had Stayed late to end his chores. But when the night b fall, the little girl helped her mother bolt the door. Indians were always near, and in their dark and quiet forms, one never knew what danger might be found. At midnight, there came a quiet tapping at the door. The mother stirred to ask who knocked, in hopes it might have been her husband, but when no answer came, in fear, she approached the covered win. Dow. Mary, her daughter, meantime thinking it was her father, had slipped to the door and unlatched its fastenings. To her surprise, a foot was forced within. In fear, the little girl leaned with all her might against the door to pin the toe that appeared. Her mother hastened to her aid, the youngest "Mother, it is father's shoe." anguished cry of relief and pain, they flung How sweet it was for johnnycakes her One day an important letter arrived from Salt Lake City. Father Terry opened it and read. His face became grave, "What is it, William?" asked his wife. "We've been called on a mission to help colonize Southern Utah, where it is said, they can grow cotton and silk for weaving. President Young wants all the experienced textile workers he can enlist to move south and help develop the industry." Mary touched the corer of her apron to her eyes and turned away. Nothing more was said about the letter that night at the Supper table. When the morning came, after a night of prayers, William went out to the barn to hitch up his team. Been asked to report to Brother Young's office as soon as Possible," he told his wife. "to discuss the matter of our move. Pl be back by evening." The best. Part of the forenoon had  LESSON DEPARTMENT passed by the time William Terry arrived at Brigham Young's office. He entered the outer room, seated himself. It was a busy office. Many people were there, who passed in to see the president. One after another gained office help inquired of Brother Terry as to his visit. The afternoon wore on. At four o'clock, William picked up his hat and left. He was an independent New Englander. That evening, when he arrived home with no report, he told his wife that they would have a few more days to wait before final word was given on the call. A week passed. Then, one morning a second letter arrived from Salt Lake City. Unmistakably, the envelope indicated the sender. It was from President Young. In effect, he had written inquiring as to why Brother Terry had not been to see him, as requested. The next day Father Terry sat down and answered. Politely he in formed the president of his trip to Salt Lake on the day following the receipt of the first letter, and of his spending the afternoon in the outer office with no results. In conclusion, he wrote, "The trip from Draper to Salt Lake is no farther than the trip from Salt Lake to Draper. I'll be at home any time you care to call." When President Young received this re-ply, he immediately drove south. The two Church members met. It was a pleasant but serious conference. They discussed the cause of Zion in its particular relation-ship to the Terry family. Not long after, Brother William and his family moved south. The sad part of this story is that while in Utah's land of Dixie, William Terry contracted an illness which took his life. He was then in his early forties. Mary and her large family, mostly daughters, again returned to Draper to make their home. Unsung, but not forgotten to the Lord, are the countless acts of like devotion that made possible the building of Zion in the latter days. This is but small tribute the writer can pay to the memory of so fine a great-grandfather and great-grand- mother. References Stories of the pioneers, extolling their virtues may be found in many sources, particularly Church magazines. Other rich sources for such stories are the lesson pamphlets issued by the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers, to be found in most Church communities, and the book A Story to Tell, issued by the Sunday School and Primary, for sale at the Deseret Book Co. Visiting Teachers' Messages Our Pioneer Heritage Lesson 7 Dependability President Amy Brown Lyman For Tuesday, April 1, 1947 Objective: To understand more completely the great pioneer virtue dependability; to show how the pioneers cherished their honor in their dealings with their fellow men. RELIGION. Which is a mighty force, and helps to bring out the best in man, was uppermost in the minds of the pioneers. It helped to confirm them in their ideal of dependability. It gave them incentive and determination to deal fairly and justly with one another, and with all others, including the traders, the trappers, and the Indians. The whole life and spirit of the pioneer camps, and, later, of the pioneer communities, was conducive to right and proper living. They could be relied upon as individuals and as groups. Their word was as good as their bond. On the 25th of July, 1847, the day after their arrival in the Valley, the following note was made in the diary of a pioneer: The President said he wanted the brethren in overhauling their wagons to return everything that did not belong to them, to the owner, as many things had been changed [exchanged] by the way; even to the value of 6% cents. The diaries of the pioneers reveal the trust and confidence they had in one another and the neighborly spirit of co-operation and generosity which existed. So great was their trust and confidence, that both men and women exchanged labor, service, and equipment, and even made loans of cash without written agreements. In those days, contracts for raising and feeding cattle, for clearing land, and for building homes were often only oral, but they were completed without misunderstandings, because of the honesty and fairness that existed among the people. Women, as well as men, were also generous and trustworthy. One pioneer woman has stated that she nursed a friend on three different occasions when babies were born, and that this friend extended to her the same service. Following, are two excerpts from the journal of a pioneer of 1847. The first refers to the time he was a resident of Perry County, Illinois, and was selling his property there preparing to leave for the West: The next day I went to the home of my brother-in-law to whom I sold some lands left me by my father. He paid me in property, and, on the 29th of January, I let Brother G. P. D., the elder who had converted and baptized me, two yoke of oxen, worth $65.00 each, and two horses, worth $65.00 each; and also $10.00 in cash to enable him to remove his family to the wilderness, he not having means of his own. In the second excerpt, May 28, 1848, at Winter Quarters, the pioneer records further: I got my wagon and equipment I had left with Brother G. A. S. Last fall when I returned from the mountains [Utah]... I let Brother S. Have my ox team put on a plow to break prairie while I was waiting on the ferry, which was very crowded. Dependability, as a trait of character, is as necessary today as it was in the days of the pioneers. In Church work, as in everyday living, the person who can be relied upon, whose word is as good as his bond, will be sought after, and his talents will be called into full and useful endeavor, both for the good of himself and that of others. Anyone who lacks dependability should strive assiduously to cultivate it.
