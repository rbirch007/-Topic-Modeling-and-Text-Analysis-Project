The New Frontier "I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause; which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvelous things without number" (Job 5:8-9).
ONE hundred years ago, Latter-day Saint women and their families were preparing to travel into an unknown land, the wilderness of the great West. The places which were familiar and dear to them had already become part of the past, and most of these women never expected to see their homeland again. They looked towards the prairies that reached to the mountains, and their wagons began the long trek over the emigrant trail, where few women before them had passed.
With the pioneer women, as with us today, only the conditions of the physical world around them were strange, for in their hearts there was a steadfast surety. They possessed that "kingdom of the soul" which could not be altered, and which would never disappear.
Today, our world is strange and unfamiliar around us, and we see much that was good and strong and beautiful being swept away by forces beyond our control. It is a pity that men, formed in the image of God and destined to walk uprightly before him, should feel themselves weak and powerless before mechanical creatures of their own making.
In the presence of this great fear, our thoughts go back to former times, and we must be disturbed to look upon the past, an age of achievement and high endeavor, as a Utopia that cannot return.
And yet our thoughts should not be wholly turned in that direction. We were not made to walk backwards. Our eyes should look towards the future, the new frontier.
Nevertheless, the old solutions are still applicable to our new problems. True Christianity, the true gospel of Jesus, in all its purity and strength, has never yet been lived by any large part of the world at any one time. The practice of this gospel and its extension constitute, for us, the work of the future.
We, as Latter-day Saints, have all the guides for our personal development, and for happiness and accord within the group, which were tested of old�the ancient commandments, the Sermon on the Mount, the Beatitudes�all of them implemented and strengthened by the scriptures and teachings given in this day. Thus, although our problems may be strange and threatening, the old answers still apply, the old virtues and the old commandments have never lost their validity. They still stand, and will stand as long as the earth endures�and after.
