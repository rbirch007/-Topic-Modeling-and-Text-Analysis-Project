TO A ROBIN IN WINTER Aileen M. Overfelt Poor little robin, so tired on the wing, Too late in the winter, too early for spring. Why did you linger, why didn't you go Before winter came with ice and with snow? Come into my cottage, my poor feathered friend, Stay here with me until the cold winter's end. Then sit by my window, the first day of spring, And caroling gaily, your happiness sing! DESERTED CABIN Maude Blixt Trone The little house that knew so much of singing, So much of laughter when the herders came, Is locked and shuttered tight against the stinging Of canyon blizzards; now there is no'flame To light the darkened forest; and no neighing Of saddle horses tethered to a post; No tinkling spurs, no stories, and no playing Of mountain music; no table laid, no host. The yard tree stands a dark and naked splinter; Those who went away will never know How desolate the little house in winter, How deep the snow.
