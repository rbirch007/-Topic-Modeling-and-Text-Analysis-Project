Tribute to Sister Louise Y. Robison President Belle S. Spafford Delivered at the general session of Relief Society Conference, Thursday afternoon, October 3, 1946 AT our last general conference, held one year ago, we were honored by the presence of Sister Louise Y. Robison. For many years Sister Robison presided over the Relief Society organization as its General President. At our last conference, we were inspired by her words, as she bore testimony to the value of membership in this organization for Latter-day Saint women. On March 30, 1946, Sister Robison passed away, leaving the great Relief Society sisterhood, whom she had so loved and so faithfully served, to mourn her passing. Through her graciousness and her good works, Sister Robison endeared herself to Relief Society women the world over. Revelations 14:13 says:
Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord . . . that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.
The works of Sister Robison will live on, a testimony to her faith and her diligence in promoting the work of our beloved Relief Society. We know that Sister Robison has entered into the place prepared by the Father for his faithful, who serve him and keep his commandments. We are grateful, as a Relief Society organization, for the life of Louise Y. Robison, and we pay tribute to her as a beloved and a noble leader of Latter-day Saint women.
WINTER RAIN
Marguerite Kirkham
The rain fell, cold and drizzling gray, On the garden and on the lawn; It beat, in a steady rhythmic sound, From the dusk of day to the dawn.
The dead leaves clung to dampened earth, The trees were deep in wintry sleep; And all was drab, and bleak, and brown, And all the willows seemed to weep.
But when I looked with different eyes, I saw the summer garden there, With roses smiling in the sun And blossoms scenting soft, warm air.
And then I felt within my heart The glory of the winter rain, And knew its gloomy downward fall Was summer's promising refrain
