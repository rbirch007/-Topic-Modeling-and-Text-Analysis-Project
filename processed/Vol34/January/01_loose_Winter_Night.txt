WINTER NIGHT
Grace M. Candland
What majesty pervades This winter night. The sky is one vast veil of blue, A million star worlds shining through.
A full moon glides along Its usual path, While frost descends on pane and tree To work its will in artistry.
Beneath, the earth is still; The hour of rest Has come, its flowering laid low, Entombed in coverlets of snow.
This frigid scene will pass And die away, And leave for nature's urgent need The nourishment for springtime seed
In all this grandeur one may see The pattern of eternity.
