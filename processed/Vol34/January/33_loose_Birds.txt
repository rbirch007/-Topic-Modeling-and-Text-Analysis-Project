birds make music all the day. Gloom is cast over this joyous picture. Hard times, falling on the kindly master of the plantation, it is suggested, compel the sale of the slaves. They must go "down the river," is the implication, to endure the grinding toil characteristic of the "sugar-cane region." There: The day goes by like a shadow o'er the heart, With sorrow where all was delight, The time has come when the darkies have to part, Then my old Kentucky home, goodnight. Then, to console their kind mistress, they sing: Weep no more, my lady, O weep no more today, We will sing one song for the old Kentucky home, For the old Kentucky home, far away.  LESSON DEPARTMENT Here, in essence, is the theme of Uncle Tom's Cabin, a novel that had much to do with precipitating the conflict. Its chief character, gentle old Uncle Tom, as all who have read Harriet Beecher Stowe's famed story will recall, lived a happy life on a Kentucky plantation; then, because of reverses that fell upon it, was "sold down the river� and came under the lash of Simon Legree. One bright spot, in this darker picture of slavery, was the delicate daughter of the plantation owner, Little Eva, who found some joy and uplift in the kindly old slave. Topsy, the little colored girl, a problem child, adds touches of humor to the tale. This novel, though somewhat melodramatic in cast, and provocative of strong feelings for or against it, still holds its place among Our classic stories. A play, Harriet, recently presented on Broadway, with Helen Hayes in the title role, very effectively portrayed the life of the author and the difficult times through which she lived and won her literary fame. In the drama, one is given also a passing acquaintance with Harriet's brother, Henry Ward Beecher, whose eloquent sermons against slavery were a potent help, as was her novel, in stirring folk to abolish the evil from our land. In this connection, it is interesting to note that one of the greatest songs of America, "Battle Hymn of the Republic," was created by Julia Ward Howe, a cousin of Harriet and Henry Ward Beecher. Lines of this great hymn pointed clearly the purpose of the fight: In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea, With a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me, As he died to make men holy, let us die to make men free, While God is marching on. America, "dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal," naturally could not be true to its highest ideals and sanction slavery. The Prophet Joseph Smith was opposed to this evil, and had his constructive plan by which the problem of freeing the slaves might well have been accomplished through peaceful means.  It was decreed otherwise. [See D. H. C. I, pp. 204-205.] Election of Abraham Lincoln placed at the head of our nation a firm hand, a man with kindly heart, and clear understanding of the common people. Wisely, courageously, he guided the "Ship of State" through the stormy sea brought on by the terrible winds of passion. With his determination, first and always to save the Union, he held the forces supporting it true to the course. Lincoln's lodestar was to save the Union. In all the four years of war, that star was kept shining brightly before him. He believed heart and soul in the principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence, bulwarked by the Constitution of the United States. His attitude and actions, as President, as well as his plain and pointed statements, leave us no doubt as to where he stood, both in relation to the Constitution, and to slavery. To one general he wrote: I am naturally anti-slavery. If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong. I cannot remember when I did not so think and feel, and yet I have never understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an un restricted right to act officially upon this 62 judgment and feeling. It was in the oath that I took that I would, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. To Horace Greeley, who seemed to feel that the President was not filling the demand to free the slaves, Lincoln wrote: I would save the Union. I would save it the shortest way under the Constitution.... What I do about slavery and the colored race, I do because | believe it helps to save the Union, and what I for. Bear, I forbear because I do not believe it within the Union, or in territory of the seceded states which had been reconquered. This action, taken only after careful, intense thought and discussion with his Cabinet, was done to help save the Union. And the Union was saved; but Abraham Lincoln became a martyr to the cause. Around his revered name a great deal of literature has been created. Praise has come alike from friend and foe. His Secretary of War, Edward Stanton, said, when the President passed away, "Now, he belongs to the ages." "In soulful lyrics, stories, dramas, orations, he is kept alive in spirit for us. Only brief reference can be made here to typical selections, with 3 few illustrative lines, "O Captain! My Captain," by Walt Whitman, voices poignant Sorrow, picturing the "Ship of State" coming in with flags flying, and people naturally rejoicing in its victory and safe return; but this poet voices his sorrow with these lines: Exult O shores, and ting O bells! But I with mournful tread, Walk the deck my Captain lies, Fallen cold and dead. William Cullen Bryant pays tribute in these soulful lines: Oh, slow to smite and swift to spare, Gentle and merciful and just! Who, in the fear of God, didst bear   sword of Power, a nation's trust! Pure was thy life; its bloody close Hath placed thee with the sons of light, Among the noblest host of those ho perished in the cause of right. One of the sweet stories that portrays the address of Gettysburg in its same occasion, his simple address of about two minutes seemed to fall with little effect. The people had listened intently to his words, but without applause. Lincoln, dispirited, so the story goes, returned to the Capital. Next evening, taking a little walk, he was run into by an excited boy who was hurrying to find a lawyer to make a will for his brother, a Confederate captain, near death from wounds at Gettysburg. The President offered to perform this service, and was taken to a nearby hospital. The will drawn, Lincoln was about to leave, when the captain, not knowing to whom he spoke, requested that he stay a few moments. In the brief LESSON DEPARTMENT ad said: "What did the senator say?" asked the quiet man who listened.   "He told my sister that the speech so went home to the hearts of all those thousands of people that when it was ended it was as if the whole audience held its breath � there was not a hand lifted to applaud. One might as well applaud the Lord's Prayer � it would have been sacrilege. And they all felt it� down to the lowest. There was a long minute of reverent silence, no sound from all that great throng � it seems to me, an enemy, that it was the most perfect tribute that has ever been paid by any people to any orator "Other men have spoken stirring words," the captain continued, "for the North and for the South, but never before, I think, with the love of both breathing through them. It is only the greatest that can be partisan without bitterness, and only such today may call himself not Northern or Southern, but American ... They are beautiful, broad words, and the sting of war would be drawn if the soul of Lincoln could be breathed into the armies." Though this little story is inclined a bit toward the dramatic, it does express some truths beautifully, and it brings a great event closer to us. Another novel, of greater scope, portraying the struggle and romance of the War, is The Crisis by Winston Churchill. Its scene of action is laid largely along the Mississippi, centering round old St. Louis and down the river, when the fight was on to open the way of the Father of Waters for commerce to the Gulf of Mexico. Another recent novel of great popularity, for a time, is Gone With the Wind. As its title suggests, it pictures the effect of the War on the South, particularly in its effects on those of the more aristocratic class. Sherman's devastating "march to the sea" across the heart of the South is vividly portrayed. Through this novel, its author brings the reader close to the realities of the struggle. Countless other stories, songs, lyrics, orations, and dramas have been created, and still are being created, out of the literary materials bequeathed by the testing years when the fate of the Union was in the balance. Time has softened the bitterness of the desperate fight. Heroic men and women who played their roles in it, on both sides, are placed in the all-American hall of fame. Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, Ulysses S. Grant, Abraham Lincoln, and other great leaders, are held in esteem by right-thinking Americans everywhere. Literature, such as the following sweet-spirited poem, has laid a healing touch on the wounds of this war between our states, and helped to make North and South again one in spirit. THE BLUE AND THE GRAY By the flow of the inland river, Whence the fleets of iron have fled, ere the blades of the Stave-grass quiver, Asleep are the ranks of the dead;  Under the sod and the dew, Waiting the judgment day:  Under the one, the Blue; Under the other, the Gray, No more shall the War-cry sever, Or the winding rivers be red; They banish our anger forever When they laurel the staves of our dead! Under the sod and the dew, Waiting the judgment day;  Love and tears for the Blue, Tears and love for the Gray.  Francis Miles Finch. 64; A simple, beautiful incident. Inspired this lyric. Its author saw the women of Columbus, Mississippi, one day decorating alike the graves of the Confederate and the Union soldiers buried there. Another notable expression the address by Henry W. Grady, of Georgia, delivered before an audience in Boston on "The New South," did much to help bring our nation together. Among the noble expressions in that fine oration are the following: The New South is enamored of her mew work. Her soul is stirred with the breath of a new life. The light of a grander day is falling fair on her face. She is thrilling with the consciousness of growing power and prosperity. As she stands upright, full-statured and equal among the people of the earth, breathing the keen air and looking out upon the expanding horizon, she understands that her emancipation came because in the inscrutable wisdom of God her honest purpose was crossed and her brave armies were beaten.... In my native town of Athens is a monument that crowns its central hills a plain, white shaft. Deep cut into its shining side is a name dear to me above the names of men, that of a brave and simple man who died in brave and simple faith. Not for all the glories of New England from Plymouth Rock all the way would I exchange the heritage he left me in his soldier's death. To the foot of that shaft I shall send my children's children to reverence him who ennobled their name with his heroic blood. But, sir, speaking from the shadow of that memory, which I honor as I do nothing else on earth, I say that the cause in which he suffered and for which he gave his life was adjudged by a higher and fuller wisdom than his or mine, and I am glad that the omniscient God held the balance on the battle in his Almighty hand, and that human slavery was swept forever from American soil the American Union saved from the wreck of war. This lofty sentiment, expressed from the heart of a true son of the South, is in perfect keeping with the simple words of General Grant, when, extending his hand to General Lee, he said, "Let us forgive and forget."
