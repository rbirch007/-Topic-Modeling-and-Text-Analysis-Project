❯ take a look at cleaned_data/txtvolumesbymonth/Vol32/March.  See if you    
  can use your LLM - not any API tokens or SDK invoking another LLM's API - 
   to break out all entries in the March issue of this periodical.  Name    
  each extract XX_Title.txt where XX is the order of appearance in the      
  monthly issue.  In the folder above, make a new json file that keeps      
  track of metadata while also preserving the content of the extract.  i    
  realize the redundancy between extracted text and json field for          
  extracted content is not ideal, but eventually the json will be the       
  single source of truth for topic modeling.  name this json file           
  "VolXX_extract_results.json" and retain a separate dictionary for each    
  month, even though this particular exercise will only include the month   
  of march.  for each extracted object, use your context to identify type   
  (article, poem, letter to the editor, etc) and account for every byte in  
  the source material. feel free to use a misc entry for extracted objects  
  that don't fit any one mold.  at the month level, identify a TOC entry so 
   it's easy to identify everything in that month without scrolling.        
  include fields that identify provenance back to source material including 
   file name, path, character offset in original source.  ask me clarifying 
   questions, state your assumptions, and propose the json schema before    
  you continue.

  Assumptions & Questions

  1. "Account for every byte" — I'll split the source so that concatenating all
  extracts in order reproduces the original file exactly (no gaps, no overlaps).
   The front matter (masthead, TOC, subscription boilerplate) will be its own
  extract (type: front_matter).
  2. Embedded poems — Several poems are embedded mid-paragraph after an article
  ends (e.g., "Easter Time" follows the Romney piece on the same line). I'll
  split at the exact character boundary. The text files will contain only the
  extracted content; the JSON will record the character offsets so you can
  verify alignment.
  3. The Emily Dickinson quote (4 lines between the Clark excerpt and the Muir
  article) — I'll classify this as quotation/misc. Same for any interstitial
  filler.
  4. "The Shape of Peace" — listed in the TOC but I don't see its body text in
  the file. If it's missing from the source, I'll note that in the JSON.
  5. File naming — 01_Front_Matter.txt, 02_Notice_of_First_Presidency.txt, etc.
  I'll sanitize titles (spaces → underscores, drop punctuation).
  6. Output locations:
    - Extracted .txt files →
  cleaned-data/relief-society/txtvolumesbymonth/Vol32/March_extracts/
    - JSON file →
  cleaned-data/relief-society/txtvolumesbymonth/Vol32/Vol32_extract_results.json
  7. Types I'll use: front_matter, article, address, fiction, poem, editorial,
  column, obituary/in_memoriam, notice, notes, devotional_essay, essay,
  biographical_article, historical_reprint, practical/instructional, quotation,
  misc

  Questions for you

  1. Embedded poems that share a line with the preceding article's last 
  paragraph — should I split surgically at the exact character, or is it OK to
  split at the nearest line boundary? (The source has very long lines — some are
   entire articles on one line.)
  2. Notes from the Field contains reports from multiple missions (East Central
  States, Northern California, New England, Hawaiian). Treat as one extract or
  break out each mission sub-report?
  3. The content field will be large (some articles are 10–20KB). You're OK with
   that given your note about the JSON becoming the single source of truth?
  4. Any preferences on the type vocabulary, or is my proposed list above
  reasonable?

✻ Churned for 1m 36s

❯ split where it makes NLP contextual sense.  approximate a human's         
  detection for when an article ends and a poem begins. treat notes from    
  the field as one extract. i don't care about content length.              

⏺ Got it. Let me build this out. I'll write a Python script to do the splitting
  precisely, accounting for every byte.

⏺ First, let me get the exact byte positions of key marker strings so I can
  define precise split points.

        in hospitals. While our local Church officers in stakes and missi

        hese boys are in order that they may visit them and give such spi
        ritual and other aid and comfort as may be possible, nevertheless
        , because not all of our boys have the  L. D. S." tag designation
        , and are generally listed merely as "Protestants" and not as mem
        bers of our Church, it is not possible for our Church officers to
         be sure they locate and identify all of our wounded brethren. If
         the parents or wives of wounded men and women, if any, will send
         to the office of the First Presidency the names and addresses of
         their sons, husbands, or daughters who have been wounded and who
         are in this country for hospital treatment, we will see that the
        ir names reach the proper officer stake, ward, or mission so that

         Director General Church Welfare Committee

      3 "FROM the beginning, the women of the Christian Church have shown
         their surpassing faith and devotion. Only one apostle stood near
         the Cross while the Christ was crucified, but Mary, the mother, 
        was there, and Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the mother of James and 
        Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children, and the women that f
        ollowed Him from Galilee. It was Mary Magdalene who was first at 
        the tomb when the Sabbath had ended, and to her Christ vouchsafed
         the first view to mortals of His resurrected body.
      4 "From that time until now woman has comforted and nursed the Chur
        ch. She has borne more than half the burdens, she has made more t
        han half the sacrifices, she has suffered most of the heartaches 
        and sorrows.
      5 "In the modern Church hers has been the abiding, unquestioning fa
        ith, the pure knowledge that has enheartened the Priesthood and k
        ept it going forward against all odds. Her loving trust, her loya
        l devotion were the faithful anchor that held when storms were fi
        ercest." (President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., Annual Conference Repor
        t, April 1940, p. 21.)
      6 The "women of the Christian Church" include the sisters of the Re
        lief Society, and to no group does this sublime tribute more aptl
        y apply.
      7 One hundred and three years ago, the Prophet "assisted in commenc
        ing the organization of the Society." In illustrating its objects
        , he said that the "sisters might provoke the brethren to good wo
        rks, in looking to the wants of the poor, searching after objects
         of charity, and in administering to their wants," (Relief Societ
        y Handbook, pp. 21-22). And later in the same month he wrote that
         its "object is the relief of the poor, the destitute, the widow 
        and the orphan, and for the exercise of all benevolent purposes."
         He was assured "that with the resources they will have at comman
        d, they will fly to the relief of the stranger; they will pour in
         oil and wine to the wounded heart of the distressed; they will d
        ry up the tears of the orphan and make the widow's heart to rejoi
        ce." (D.H.C. Vol. IV, p. 567.)
      8 To guide them in this work, the sisters were to "receive instruct
        ions through the order of the Priesthood which God has establishe
        d, through the medium of those appointed to lead, guide and direc
        t the affairs of the Church in this last dispensation." (D.H.C. V
        ol. IV, p. 567.)

      1 Are We Getting Ready for 1947 One-Hundredth Anniversary Program? 
        The Honorable Herbert B. Maw Governor of the State of Utah Prepar
        ed by Governor Maw at the request of the Church Beautification Co
        mmittee. THE State of Utah is definitely and officially in favor 
        of a state-sponsored celebration of the hundredth anniversary of 
        the arrival in Salt Lake Valley of the Utah pioneers. The Utah St
        atutes provide that "the exposition provided in connection with t
        he centennial observance shall be officially opened on May 1, 194
        7, and continue to October 15, 1947." This law was passed in 1939
        . It followed the recommendations of a committee authorized by a 
        joint resolution adopted by the Legislature in 1937. The Act stat
        es that its purpose is "to commemorate the advent of the pioneers
         into Salt Lake Valley, to portray fittingly the natural resource
        s and scenic wonders of Utah, the prehistoric culture of the west
        , the development of irrigation, farming, mining, forestry, trans
        portation, culture and the arts." The law authorizes a Centennial
         Commission of fifteen members, selected "without regard to polit
        ical or other affiliations" who serve without compensation, to be
         confirmed by the State Senate and to hold office as members of a
         body corporate for ten years, thus continuing until the completi
        on of the celebration and exposition, and the winding up of its a
        ffairs. The members include President David O. McKay, of Salt Lak
        e City, as chairman; Former Governor Charles R. Mabey, J. F. Fitz
        patrick, S. O. Bennion, David H. Thomas, John M. Wallace, D. M. D
        raper, Gus P. Backman, Donald P. Lloyd, and Postmaster L A. Smoot
        , all of Salt Lake City; Mrs. Rosella F. Larkin and J. A. Howell,
         of Ogden; F. P. Champ, of Logan; A. O. Ellett, at that time a Pr
        ovo resident; and Senator Ward C. Holbrook, of Bountiful. The lat
        e Nephi L. Morris, of Salt Lake City, was a member of the Commiss
        ion at the time of his death. The Commission was instructed by th
        e Act creating it to "plan and arrange for a fitting centennial o
        bservance in the year 1947, with appropriate provision being made

         MAGAZINE MARCH 1945 The Centennial Commission has wide authority
         to proceed as its considered judgment may direct. In retrospect,
         this project for a new kind of World's Fair one in which the mai
        n attractions were to be some of the world's greatest wonders and
         some of its most attractive scenery "in place" must appear a bol
        d one, and worthy of the sturdy independence of the pioneers who 
        came to this desert region a century ago and here developed a new
         form of western culture based on irrigation, the range, and the 
        mine. Such plans were all the more remarkable because, at the tim
        e they were forming, this State and the world at large were steep
        ed in the most severe and most widely spread economic depression 
        in history. Many citizens were pinching their last few pennies. S
        chools and other public institutions were getting along on pittan
        ces far below their needs. At such a time, it required both coura
        ge and leadership on the part of men of vision to rally support f
        or an undertaking which would require large expenditures, one fro
        m which the returns, though perhaps certain, would be largely int
        angible. Then war intervened. A far-seeing National Government in
        augurated an emergency defense program in 1939 and 1940. After De
        cember 7, 1941, this country was plunged into the most destructiv
        e struggle in all history. Wartime needs would not be denied. Men
         and women were summoned to battle. Vast projects were initiated.
         Labor shortages became acute. Rigid priorities were established.
         Today, Utah boys and girls are fighting and dying on the battle-
        fronts of the world to preserve that way of life for which their 
        pioneer ancestors gave their all. We cannot and we must not let t
        hem down. Is all, then, lost? Has everything been sacrificed on M
        ars' bloody altar? Must we entirely forego the duty we owe to the
         founders of this commonwealth, to honor their courage and their 
        self-sacrifice, to pay fitting tribute to their daring and resour
        cefulness? Is there no way in which we can renew the ideals for w
        hich they lived and died? Those ideals have made this State and t
        he Intermountain Region great. They have stirred the hearts of me
        n to battle for freedom and to love their fellow man. The men and
         women Utah desires to honor were not in the habit of giving up t
        heir plans because difficulties confronted. Their sons and daught
        ers and those who followed the pioneers into this land will profi
        t by their example, will display the same independence and leader
        ship. Utahns will not permit the murk of war to blot out the cent
        ennial of the State's founding. Wartime conditions may restrict t
        he extent of the celebration. They cannot obliterate the memory o
        f the Utah pioneers, nor can they quench the ardor and enthusiasm
         of the celebrants. WHAT sort of celebration shall be attempted i
        f the war with Germany and Japan is still being desperately waged
         in 1947? Are we prepared with an adequate program if world peace
         has come by that time? Or if either of the remaining Axis foes i
        s still on his feet? The answer to these queries becomes fairly o
        bvious. Such observance of the centennial is always possible Tori
        us Knaphus THE HANDCART as will not require great expenditures of
         manpower suitable for military service or war industry work. In 
        the meantime, plans must be formulated blueprints drawn, if you l
        ike ready to be put into action the minute manpower and materials
         become available should hostilities cease or slacken. It would s
        eem basic, for example, that, in order to celebrate properly, the
         State must take on a holiday attire. This is something in which 
        each resident can join. There is nothing in war's demands that re
        quires broken down fences, filthy corrals, dilapidated outbuildin
        gs or unpainted homes. Rather do neatness and order go hand-in-ha
        nd with efficient, productive labor, and that is one of the essen
        tials of the war effort. Let Utah, then, dress up in honor of her
         pioneer founders. That much groundwork for an adequate celebrati
        on certainly is possible. Other forms of observance which require
         little or no extra drain on the State's manpower can be encourag
        ed. An art exhibition, an Easter pageant, a State or County Fair,
         any activity which has become a customary and periodic outlet fo
        r community effort can tell the story of a century during which c
        ivilization and the modern way of life were established on the un
        promising and hostile desert. Let the management and sponsors of 
        all such community events redouble their efforts to make the 1947
         version far excel all its predecessors. It will prove an eloquen
        t tribute to the greatness of the enterprise the Utah pioneers in
        stituted. These are but suggestions for a beginning of the ground
        work of the centennial program. Other and more definite features 
        will be worked out as circumstances permit. The main idea is that
         this great historic occasion can and must be fittingly commemora
        ted. The spirit of the pioneers of western irrigation is not dead
        . That same indomitable courage and ingenuity which enabled them 
        to direct the harsh natural forces to man s benefit will encourag
        e us their sons and daughters, to pay adequate tribute to our for
        efathers  accomplishments.

      1 THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAY 1 begin by saying that the Relief Society 
        of the Church is far and away the greatest woman's organization i
        n the world. It is great not alone in its aims and purposes, whic
        h are to alleviate the want, misery, and suffering of humanity; n
        ot alone in its almost earth-wide reach, for it covers the bulk o
        f the Christian world; not alone in the achievements of its activ
        ities, though it has brought to the needy, living where it worked
        , food, clothing, shelter, fuel; not though it has nursed those w
        ho were sick, buried the dead of the poor, comforted those who we
        re downhearted; not though it has sustained those who were weak i
        n spirit, built up righteousness in the hearts of the wayward, an
        d brought the living truth into the homes of all who give it an a
        biding place, to their salvation and final exaltation,  the Relie
        f Society is greatest, not alone because of all these, but becaus
        e its directing head and the great bulk of all those who make up 
        its membership share as of right in the blessings and promises of
         the priesthood borne by their husbands the Holy Priesthood of Go
        d; greatest because its leaders and members have the right to the
         inspiration of the Lord in the carrying on of their work; greate
        st because in their work of now almost a century they have been r
        ichly endowed by that inspiration, they have been constantly dire
        cted by the Spirit of the Lord which has never departed from them
         since the Prophet brought a few (18) of the sisters together and
         set them about their work. These, Sisters, have been your sacred
         opportunities, and your glorious, Christ-like achievements. Pres

       1 Easter and the Second Coming of the Lord Elder Leo J. Muir Forme
         r President Los Angeles Stake And Former President Northern Stat
         es Mission (Chicago) AS thoughtful and devout Christians celebra
         te the coming Easter season, their minds and hearts are likely t
         o be beckoned forward to the coming of the Master, rather than b
         ackward to his resurrection. Christ's triumphant arising from th
         e tomb is being overshadowed by the nearness of his second comin
         g to the earth. The early future promises to realize for mankind
          the prophetic salutation: "Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazi
         ng up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you i
         nto heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go 
         into heaven."
       2 Here indeed is heaven's supreme salutatory to mortal man. This p
         roclamation has provoked more discussion and speculation than an
         y other word or prophecy. The unbeliever has jested about it and
          ridiculed it. Many people have predicted the immediate fulfillm
         ent all down the generations of time. The devout have fearfully 
         and reverently invoked God's day for its fulfillment.
       3 The signs of the times point to the early coming of this gloriou
         s spectacle the coming to earth of the Lord Jesus Christ in the 
         clouds of heaven. That we might contemplate this auspicious occa
         sion in its full significance let us review briefly the scenes i
         n the great drama which closed with this marvelous prophecy. The
          events of the Passion Week are punctuated by a few sentences wh
         ich stand out in bold relief against the dismal background of sh
         ame and sorrow.
       4 Out of the peaceful, yet disturbing, ceremony of the Last Supper
          came the immortal injunction: "This do ye in remembrance of me.
         " From the shadowed precincts and the deep anguish of Gethsemane
          came the grief-laden prayer of the Master: "O my Father, if it 
         be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless not as I wi
         ll, but as thou wilt."
       5 "And they crucified him" is the laconic account of the cruel and
          gruesome tragedy of Golgotha. These colorless words a conjuncti
         on, two pronouns, and a verb record the fact of the execution of
          the Son of God, who died that death may be no more. On death's 
         own battlefield, Christ the Lord destroys death for the children
          of men.
       6 "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews" was the accusation written
          in three languages: the Hebrew, the Greek, and the Latin. The f
         irst of these is the tongue through which God had revealed his w
         ill to his prophets; the second is the language of culture and t
         he learning of that day; and the third, the language
       7 Page 139 of the conquering race which then held the Holy Land un
         der subjection. This superscription, thus written, heralded to a
         ll people the alleged reason for the conviction and crucifixion 
         of the Christ. The "Chief Priest of the Jews" protested that the
          accusation was not right: that it should indicate that Christ h
         ad said he was King of the Jews. Pilate stubbornly refused to al
         ter the superscription and there it stood. It must have pleased 
         the heart of Jesus to know that his true status as King of the J
         ews was so boldly proclaimed.
       8 "Truly this was the Son of God" was the emphatic verdict of the 
         Roman centurion who had, as an officer on guard, observed the st
         upid and brutal performance.
       9 "He is risen" came as the calm and solemn assurance of the angel
          who answered the excited inquiry of "Mary Magdalene and the oth
         er Mary." Though calmly spoken, and to these two women alone, th
         ese angelic words reflect the triumphant climax in this eternal 
         drama. And what triumph it was indeed; not alone for the resurre
         cted Christ, who knew full well that he would arise, but for the
         se faithful women and for all the disciples to whom they carried
          the glorious message. They restored that if Christ arose from t
         he tomb, man also will arise from his tomb. In this fact mortal 
         life finds its loftiest hope. No greater boon could be fashioned
          for the souls of men. The two women doubted not the report of t
         he angel, but, at his bidding, hastened "with fear and great joy
         " to carry the glad tidings to those whom Christ affectionately 
         called "my brethren." On the way they met the Christ,
      10 and were requested to summon his disciples to meet him in a moun
         tain in Galilee. Here in the uplands, against the sky, the Chris
         t whose ministry was now given new force and power gave final in
         struction to those who should follow him.

        d the coals closer under her bakeoven. Even if she was nearly ele
        ven, bread-making took the starch right out of her. The wood Isaa
        c brought didn't make good coals. She was going to tell Pa well, 
        maybe not now. Lately Pa didn't seem to love them any more than H
        eavenly Father did. It wasn't as if they didn't know, 'cause they
         did. All year the saints had talked and prayed about it, and if 
        that wasn't enough there were her own secret prayers. No, Heavenl
        y Father didn't have the excuse of not knowing; but Pa might not 
        know about the chopping. At noon she had tried to tell him. "I am
         not leaving." He had scowled at her. "Nothing short of the Unite
        d States Army will move me." Julia didn't know about the United S
        tates Army. All she knew was Johnson Army. Everybody was moving s
        outh to get away from him. Everybody, but them. Julia wasn't hank
        ering for a move. She'd had too many of them. This place in the c
        anyon was the only real home she could remember. But burning it a
        nd moving south would be better than the chopping. DOROTHY CLAPP 
        ROBINSON "Brother Williams says he is following the Move so his f
        amily will be safe." For a moment Pa hadn't spoken. When he did, 
        his voice was the way it sometimes got when they talked about Ma.
         "Maybe I should have taken you to your grandma; but Grantsville 
        is a long way." He looked about the Page 143 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZ
        INE MARCH 1945 room. "I snaked these logs out of the canyon. Your
         Ma helped me raise them. I will put my trust in the Lord and sta
        y here." When Pa used that tone of voice there was no use going o
        n. Trusting was all right for him. He was an old man, nearly thir
        ty-six, and old men are not afraid. Dorcas Williams had whispered
         to her about the chopping. She said when Old Johnson Army got to
         the Valley, if he found any young'uns there, he would cut off th
        eir ears, and maybe chop off both hands and both feet. Like Squaw
         Bill. She'd done something and the bucks of her tribe had choppe
        d off her hands. Now she lived with the Williamses. After banking
         the fire Julia went outside. At the woodpile she found a long, t
        hick sliver. She would use it to try the bread. Sister Williams h
        ad put her on to that. No sense trusting to looks. The first time
         she had baked after Ma died, she had her lesson. Because the bre
        ad was brown she'd thought it was done. Spreading one of Ma's sno
        wy dish-wipers on the hearth, she had lifted the oven to turn out
         the bread. Instead of coming out in loaves, the crust had broken
        ; and dough had run all over the dishwiper. She'd scooped it back
         in a hurry with her bare hands, so none of it would be wasted. T
        hat had been a mess with burned hands and only slow-poke Sally to
         help. As Julia started toward the house with her sliver, she saw
         a curl of smoke far down the Valley then another. The burning ha
        d started! That meant Old Johnson Army was close. She sat down on
         a stump and tears trickled down her thin cheeks. Oh, Ma, why cou
        ldn't you have stayed. Pa would listen to you. President Young wh
        en he was up to see Pa said, "You're a brave girl, and don't worr
        y, Ma is happy." Huh. Heaven must be something; or Ma had changed
         in a hurry. She knew Hi was only ten months old and that Sally w
        as slow as molasses in a snowdrift. Well, maybe Old Johnson Army 
        would kill all of them. It would be a relief, at that, to turn Sa
        lly and Isaac over to Ma. FOR supper they had bread'n'milk and In
        jun-meal mush. Pa got a slice of the new bread. He worked hard, a
        nd if he liked it, he might listen about the chopping. He liked i
        t. He even said Julia would soon be as good a breadmaker as her m
        other; but when she tried to talk "Move" he laid down his spoon a
        nd looked at her. "I am not being chased out of my home again. Be
        sides, when you put your trust in the Lord you leave it up to him
        ." "We'll be alone. Everybody is go- "Some won't go. You wouldn't
         want to go without me, would you?" "No-o." She blinked back the 
        tears that stung her eyeballs. The young'uns had all stopped eati
        ng to listen. "No, but there is Tommy and Baby ." Pa broke a crus
        t of his new bread and gave it to Baby Hi, who was in the highcha
        ir by him. He put an extry spoonful of molasses on Tommy's mush. 
        The quiet was something turrible, and Pa's hand shook sb some of 
        the molasses spilled. At last he looked straight at Julia. He rea
        lly was an old man. "I have thought about it, and THOUGH A HOST E
        NCAMP AGAINST THEE 145 prayed about it, and listened to counsel. 
        I am going to stay." Just then Isaac tipped over his milk. Julia 
        boxed his ears, but by the time she'd cleaned it up Pa was gone, 
        saying he was going to work late at the gristmill. He took John w
        ith him. John was two years older than Julia, and worked with Pa 
        now. Later, Julia lay staring into the darkness. She was in Pa's 
        bed in the front room so she could watch Tommy and Baby. There wa
        s no use closing her eyes when Old Johnson Army stayed right in f
        ront of them. She raised on her elbow. By the light of the moon s
        hining through the open doorway she could see the little ones. Ba
        by Hi had one chubby fist under his cheek. Tommy was on his back 
        with arms and legs outstretched. Just imagine that old sooner hur
        ting them! She didn't care if Pa got clean out of patience with h
        er; she was not going to see them hurt. If neither Pa nor Heavenl
        y Father was going to do anything, she would have to. SLOWLY an i
        dea came to her. It grew and grew. She would get Bally from the p
        asture. He was gentle and would carry five. She would bundle some
         didies and food, and they would leave before Pa got back. With t
        hem gone, Pa and John could hide. It was terrible to go again you
        r own father, but she had a duty to the young uns. Slipping out o
        f bed, she dressed hurriedly. As she stood a moment in the doorwa
        y, a lump swelled in her throat. Something just like one of Ma's 
        arms held her tight to the place. The moon was high. The mountain
        s had moved close and the run-along song of the crick was enough 
        to wake the dead. Warm chills ran up her back. After the heat and
         dust of the plains it was like well, like having Ma after not ha
        ving her. Leaving the yard, she walked toward the pasture where t
        hey kept Bally. The gristmill stood out like a ghost. It was made
         of logs, like the house. Until lately, both had seemed so safe a
        nd strong. Especially after the plains. She couldn't remember Nau
        voo much, and about all she could remember of Winter Quarters was
         tents and wagons. She could remember how cold the Platte River w
        as for she had fallen into it. She could remember an Injun trying
         to buy her, and she could remember Jim Bridger's squaws. Leastwa
        ys she could remember their bright blankets. But her best remembe
        ring was of heat and dust, and how tired her legs got gathering b
        uffalo chips. She had never rightly understood about the moving. 
        Everyone said, have faith, the Lord will give us a home, but that
         hadn't stopped the wagons. Until they reached the Valley, it had
        n't. No one had kept up with the moving more willingly than the P
        hippens. She didn't blame Pa for not wanting to start that again.
         Still-. Bally wasn't in the pasture. Just her luck to have Pa us
        ing him. She'd sneak up. If the mill was running, she might get h
        im away without being heard. There was no light in the mill. The 
        big door was open but there was no sign of Pa or John. The inside
         dark was so quiet she could hear a rat gnawing. What if they had

         you are doing it to him. But she was taking the young'uns to saf
        ety. A sound from the hillside made her turn. She waited breathle
        ssly until it came again. It was Bally sneezing. Now what was he 
        doing up there? Slipping from shadow to shadow she approached a s
        mall grove on a near slope. Within the grove was a small cave whe
        re the young'uns often played. Among the trees the light was dim,
         and, for a moment, she could see nothing. Then she saw them. The
        y must have been using him, for Bally was tied to a quaker. Pa an
        d John were piling brush and dead branches over the mouth of the 
        cave, but helter-skelter to make it look natural. 'Think anyone w
        ill find it?" she heard John ask. "Never," Pa answered. "We can m
        ove it after the trouble is over." Julia forgot Bally. She forgot
         why she had come. She remembered only that here was more trouble
        , and different than she had dreamed of. Now she couldn't run out
         on Pa no matter what he had done. Back in bed she tried to smoth
        er her hard breathing. Directly she heard them come in. Baby Hi f
        ussed a little as Pa lay down beside him, but almost at once Pa w
        as snoring. Then Julia looked at her thoughts. They had buried so
        mething. It must be turrible or they wouldn't make a secret of it
        . Maybe they had killed an Injun, or maybe even Old Johnson Army.
         Maybe he had come sneaking around to do the chopping and they ha
        d beat him to it. Pa was in Dutch either way. If it was Johnson A
        rmy, the Gove'-ment  she didn't know what that was but everyone t
        alked about it-would be on his trail. If it was an Injun her hear
        t beat suffocatingly. You can't fool Injuns for long. Besides, Pa
         might be called before the Brethren. He might even be in danger 
        of hell-fire. The scriptures said something about shedding innoce
        nt blood. She hoped Injun blood wasn't too innocent, but who had 
        the say-so? Every way she looked there was a thick black wall. Sh
        e just had to have help. She'd try Heavenly Father again. Ma had 
        been strong on prayer. Slipping out of bed she knelt down and put
         her face against the bedding. Protect them all, especially Pa an
        d John, and if it had to be a killing they'd done, let it be John
        son Army. Some good would come of that, but killing an Injun woul
        d be all bad. Let Pa lose his stubborn streak and light out, come
         daybreak. Maybe they could still catch up with the others. Sudde
        nly, she realized she was talking more to Ma than to Heavenly Fat
        her. Likely he would overlook it, seeing she was one of his newes
        t angels. JULIA woke, heavy with dread, but the morning was so br
        ight she could almost believe she dreamed about the cave. If her 
        prayer was to be answered, now was the time. Pa was stirring the 
        mush when she entered the kitchen. She hastened to wipe off the t
        able and set out the dishes. All the time she listened for the wo
        rd from Pa, but it didn't come. Her mush stuck in her throat. May
        be Heavenly Father THOUGH A HOST ENCAMP AGAINST THEE 147 hadn't l
        iked the way she prayed after all. She hadn't said thy will 'caus
        e she wanted her will this time. Three times she caught Pa lookin
        g at her. He told her again what a good bake she got on the bread
        . He warned Isaac and Sally he'd tend to them if they didn't help
         more. As he was leaving, he took his gun. "Keep no bring the you
        ng'uns up to the mill when your work is done. They can play aroun
        d up there." Julia made herself real busy so she wouldn't look at
         him. Her last hope was gone. A heavy ache inside made her feet b
        ig and her hands slow. Pa pretended to be working hard, but he st
        opped every little while to stand looking. Most often his eyes tu
        rned toward the canyon where lay the road into the Valley. He kep
        t his gun close beside him. The sun hadn't found the bottom of th
        e canyon yet when a rider came pounding up to the yard of the mil
        l. It was Jim Ashley, and Pa came out to talk to him.  This is yo
        ur last chance" Julia heard Jim say. "Tomorrow will be too late. 
        What's a mill anyway?" "The saints will need flour wherever they 
        are." Pa spoke real slow but every word stood out. "Mills don't g
        row on trees. I am staying with mine." Julia was right proud of h
        im for a minute; but if Brother Ashley couldn't budge him, no one
         could. The best she could do was keep the young'uns close around
        . What happened to one would happen to all. About noon Lafe Cartr
        ight came by. He had been left to do the burning if it came to th
        at. Some, he said, had got in a hurry and done the burning themse
        lves. Pa agreed that was foolish. "Well, it will soon be over," L
        afe called, as he rode away. Julia was past all feeling. If the w
        orst, was to come, it would, only she hadn't thought God would be
         one-sided. She had tried to be good; as good as Dorcas, but the 
        Williamses were safe. 'Course she couldn't put all the blame on H
        eavenly Father, but if he could move mountains why couldn't he ch
        ange Pa's mind? As soon as Lafe was out of sight, Julia moved Bab
        y Hi close by the mill steps. She called Tommy to come play on th
        e blanket with him. She tried to mend, but the patch kept puckeri
        ng. Finally she threw it aside. The minutes were endless. Suddenl
        y, John let go with a loud yell from the roof of the mill where P
        a had stationed him. "Here they come." Quicker than skat Pa shinn
        ed up the corner of the mill and was looking to where John pointe
        d. Isaac and Sally climbed the big tree that hung over the crick.
         "I can see them," Isaac shouted, and Sally added her, "I can, to
        o." Julia started to climb the mill, but halfway up she turned ba
        ck. The mill roof was too far away. She stood on a stump near the
         babies. She looked where the others were looking, and, suddenly,
         she saw a thousand or maybe even a million points of light, like
         the sun hitting guns. "What is it?" she called, eager to share w
        hat the others were seeing. "The Army," Pa was breathing hard lik
        e he had been running. "Johnson's Army. Caught up with us at last
        ." RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE MARCH 1945 "I can't see good," Sally c
        ried. Trying to move, she slipped and fell into the water with a 
        yell and a splash. By the time they had pulled her out and change
        d her clothes and rubbed arnica on her bruises, the Army was gone
        . Pa went back up and locked the mill, and then he helped lay out
         an early supper. He even got a jar of Ma's sarvis-berry jelly. T
        hree times in the night, Julia heard him walking around. LATE eve
        ning of the next day, Jim Ashley came back. Pa hadn't been at the
         mill all day, and it seemed he couldn't wait for Jim to get ther
        e. He went a piece to meet him. When he came back he sat down on 
        the doorstep. He looked so happy Julia sat down beside him. The y
        oung'uns, except John, were in bed; and darkness filled all the h
        ollows. "What did Jim say?" she asked finally. "It's over." Pa's 
        voice sounded as young as John's only it didn't squeak. 'The Lord
         was with, us even as I doubted." Julia looked at him in surprise
        . "Were you afraid?" "I was scared stiff." "What's Johnson's Army
        , Pa, and why did the saints have to move?" "We thought we were i
        n for trouble again. We thought the soldiers would take our homes
         and we were not going to let that happen again. We would burn th
        em first. That is why men were left to set fires." The gid looked
         around at the mountains in the back, with the moon just peeping 
        over the rim. She looked at the lake in the distance, and the slo
        ping Valley between. It was wonderful to have a home that was saf
        e and strong and a Pa that was scared but stayed anyway. She coul
        d talk to him now. Words tripped over her tongue trying to get sa
        id. She told about the chopping and how she thought Johnson Army 
        was a cruel giant. She even owned up to her feelings against him 
        and Heavenly Father. Pa listened without saying a word. It was br
        ight moonlight now, and she could see slow tears run down into hi
        s whiskers. He drew her close against him. "Poor little young'un,
        " he said, "I have been so wrapped up in my own worries I have ov
        erlooked yours. I have expected too much of you, but it seems lik
        e you are my right hand." Julia hardly breathed. She didn't want 
        to spoil the sweetness of that moment, but she must know one thin
        g more. "What about the Injun, Pa?" "What Injun?" his voice was p
        uzzled. "The one you buried in the cave." Slowly Pa's eyes came a
        live. He started to laugh, quietly at first, then lively. She had
        n't heard such fun in his voice since before Ma took sick. "The I
        njun we buried was flour. That is why Brother Young was up to see
         me. We thought we might lose the mill but we couldn't take chanc
        es on the flour." Through the soft light she could see the trust 
        in his eyes. "We were wrong, both of us. We forgot there are many
         ways for prayers to be answered. His way was much better than yo
        urs or THOUGH A HOST ENCAMP AGAINST THEE 149 mine. The Army has g
        one on down to the Jordan. There isn't going to be any trouble." 
        Suddenly the breadmaking, the care of the young'uns were mere tri
        fles. Heavenly Father had remembered them. A verse Ma used to rea
        d came to her mind. "Some put their trust in chariots; and some i
        n horses: but we will remember the name of the Lord, our God." Ye
        s. She would always remember. Dorothy Clapp Robinson, third prize

      1 The Story of a Gifted Lady Leah D. Widtsoe ALICE MERRILL HORNE HE
         was an unlearned, ordinary looking farmer's lad, who had spent h
        is days at farm drudgery, for his parents were struggling to make
         the farm produce a scanty living for their growing family. But w
        ithin him dwelt the power to see beauty in the glowing sunsets, t
        he bright tints of autumn, and the glorious light effects on the 
        mountains, clouds, and valleys wherever he worked. Even the good 
        earth talked to him as he turned the brown fur-Page 150 rows for 
        spring planting. He also possessed the gift of putting on paper o
        r canvas or anything on which he could lay his hands, the picture
        s which crowded through his mind. So, instead of spending his sca
        nty earnings on new clothes, or guns and powder, with which to ki
        ll God's innocent creatures, he bought paper, crayons, paints, an
        d oils, and transferred the pictures of his mind to paper or canv
        as, until his home was crowded with the results of his leisure ef
        forts. At first his mother encouraged him, but later began to fee
        l that he should be spending his time on something more profitabl
        e. Then one day, through a lucky chance, he met A Fairy Godmother
         She took the time to visit his home, recognized his gift, and to
        ld him that he should cultivate it. When told how impossible that
         would be financially, she volunteered to sell his pictures, ther
        eby helping him to raise money with which to attend a great art s
        chool in the East. Then this dainty, but indomitable, art patron 
        went to a number of the well-to-do people in the city, told them 
        the story of the gifted farmer's lad, and soon had sold enough of
         his pictures to enable him to achieve the ambition of his life. 
        This good lady has rendered similar service for many of Utah's gi
        fted sons and daughters. She has been, and still is, a real fairy
         godmother THE STORY OF A GIFTED LADY 151 to them, and through he
        r encouragement has taken a leading role in making Utah art consc
        ious. Wouldn't you like to know more about her? Her life story be
        gins in the days when the pioneers were called to settle remote p
        arts of the (then) Territory, and it bristles with tales of India
        n unrest as well as the romance of state-building. It is as excit
        ing and interesting as any which begins with the intriguing Once 
        Upon A Time Once in a very great while, an especially gifted spir
        it is sent to earth to take a body and become a blessing to many 
        people and the state, as well as to family and friends. Such a pr
        ecious spirit came to the frontier log cabin home of Clarence Mer
        rill and Bathsheba Smith, who were each descended from stalwart U
        tah pioneers. The father was called by Brigham Young to learn tel
        egraphy, and then to settle first at Cove Creek Fort, that outpos
        t of Indian activity, and later to take care of telegraph operati
        ons at Fillmore, which was then the capital of Utah Territory. Th
        ere a baby daughter was born to them, and was named Alice Smith M
        errill. She grew to be a lovely child, who was later to honor hig
        hly the name and the lineage she bears. Two of her great-grandpar
        ents. Patriarch John Smith and his wife Clarissa Loomis Lyman, we
        re pioneers of 1847, and all four of her grandparents were early 
        pioneers also. Her grandfather, George A. Smith, was both Church 
        historian and first counselor to President Brigham Young, while h
        er grandmother, Bathsheba W. Smith, was the fourth general presid
        ent of the Relief Society. Two of her great-grandparents passed a
        way before reaching the "Valley." Thus Alice is a true daughter o
        f pioneers, and the fourth generation of believers in the restore
        d gospel of Jesus Christ. The girlhood of this favored child was 
        passed in the ideal environment of a fine, two-story brick home (
        evolved from the log cabin) located in a quarter block of garden 
        and orchard, in company with a large family of brothers and siste
        rs to help make life a round of merriment as well as of struggle.
         There were vegetables and fruits to be gathered in summer, wild 
        strawberries and native black currants, choke cherries, and servi
        ce berries to be brought from the canyons; fruit to be canned and
         dried in autumn; with quilt blocks to make and rags to be sewed 
        for carpets during the long winter hours when school was out. The
        se chores were varied with pleasurable activities, for her parent
        s were leaders in the Fillmore Dramatic Society, as well as being
         gifted with musical talents. Around the family hearthstone the f
        amily often re-enacted stirring scenes from history or from Shake
        speare, each dressing, as best he could, in character. The mother
         always had a lovely flower garden, and Alice early learned to ap
        preciate the beauties of mountains, streams, blue skies, and clou
        d effects, as well as the glories of summer gardens and winter sc
        enes of snowy grandeur. In fact, the love of beauty seemed to be 
        a part of her very being, for she sought it in the everyday tasks
         as well as in her moments of leisure. She loved to draw, and ear
        ly showed aptitude in transferring to paper the images of her min
        d. She was a good student also, for when but a child she took a p
        rize in the old rock schoolhouse as the best reader. Then when bu
        t eight years old came her Great Adventure After the passing of h
        er grandfather, George A. Smith, her grandmother ("Aunt Bathsheba
        " to all the other daughters of Zion) was living alone, and lonel
        y. So she invited her granddaughter, Alice, to come to "the city"
         and live with her in the old Historian's Office, next to the mag
        nificent Gardo House, which was then the official residence of th
        e president of the Church. What a rare experience for this beauty
        -loving child! Here she helped her grandmother read and sort old 
        letters, classified the hundreds of pictures her grandfather had 
        brought from his trips to Europe and the Holy Land, met and learn
        ed to know all the great men and women of early Mormon history, w
        ho were intimate friends of her grandmother. From a child to youn
        g womanhood, she became associated with the early development of 
        the Relief Society in the new Zion; also the Retrenchment Society
        , as well as the suffrage movement for Women's Rights, so-called.
         Meetings for these activities, as well as those of the Women's D
        eseret Hospital, Woman's Exponent (the pioneer women's newspaper)
        , and many others of pioneer interest, were all conducted in her 
        grandmother's back parlor. Alice was an ardent listener and youth
        ful participant. It is no wonder that she became "organization-mi
        nded." When but nine years old she felt to organize RELIEF SOCIET
        Y MAGAZINE MARCH 1945 the young girls into a society, which they 
        called "The Juvenile Association." She chose six counsellors  ins
        tead of two among them the youngest daughter of Brigham Young, Fa
        nny V., Katie B. Fen ton, Lutie Y. Thatcher, Lulu Clawson, Ada Cr
        oxall, Edna Wells, with Daisy Woods, a granddaughter of Emme-line
         B. Wells, as secretary. They visited and prayed for the sick, an
        d later joined, in a body, the first organized Primary Associatio
        n. Meanwhile, Alice was using her pencil and sketch book as well 
        as attending school. While in Miss Mary Cook's school, she won th
        e prize for the best drawing a sketch from memory given by Dr. El
        len B. Ferguson. Later, she won an award given by the early Utah 
        artist and teacher at the University of Deseret  now the Universi
        ty of Utah-George M. Ottinger. Still later, she won a medal offer
        ed by the artist J. T. Harwood, which was awarded by John Hafen, 
        one of Utah's greatest artists. This was naturally a stimulus to 
        her innate desire to produce pictures herself, and to foster in o
        thers the love of art, to which her life has been devoted. But ar
        t did not claim all her interest. In 1887, she was graduated from
         the University of Utah. She wrote her thesis on two of Shakespea
        re's women  Lady Macbeth and Ophelia. Her interest in good litera
        ture has always been keen. In 1890, Alice married George Henry Ho
        me, also a descendant of stalwart pioneers. He was an ideal husba
        nd for this talented woman, for besides being a fine man Jn his o
        wn right, he was openminded enough to recognize the gifts of his 
        talented wife and to encourage her THE STORY OF A GIFTED LADY 153
         to use them. It takes a big man to do that. In 1893, they visite
        d the Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and later went to New York
        , Washington, Boston, San Francisco, and the Northwest, visiting 
        especially the art galleries and other places of interest. In 189
        4, the young husband was called on a mission to the Southern Stat
        es. Alice, being a good soldier, taught art in the public schools
         while he was gone. She also undertook serious work in art from J
        . T. Harwood, who had just returned from study in the Julian and 
        Beaux Arts Academies of Paris, France. She also studied from Mary
         Teasdel, student of James McNeill Whistler. In 1898, she was urg
        ed by many friends to run for the legislature. In this, as in her
         many other activities, her husband counselled her acceptance. Sa
        id he, "Wifey," (his pet name for her) "if you want to help Utah 
        to become art-minded, you will have to get in there and work for 
        it." She was elected, and made herself noteworthy by introducing 
        a bill which provided for an annual exhibition and state art coll
        ection. Georgina G. Marriott as director of fine arts at the Stat
        e Fair put the exhibition into Alice's hands, and for five years 
        she made the Art Gallery famous. Instead of giving many prizes, t
        he best pictures were purchased, making them the property of the 
        State as well as encouraging the artists. This greatly encouraged
         art studies and Utah artists also, establishing the nucleus of a
        n art collection by the State of Utah, which was named in honor o
        f the originator, "The Alice Art Collection.  ALICE MERRILL HORNE
         AS A GIRL Thus the Utah Art Institute was established, making Ut

        ny prominent people made gifts of paintings, and this collection 
        of over seventy pictures is now housed in the upper galleries of 
        the State Capitol. After an existence of over forty years and an 
        expenditure of over $60,000, the act was repealed in the interest
         of the so-called "Modern Art" (or is it art?) which at great exp
        ense is trying to convert the public to what is considered the Ne
        w Art. Mrs. Home has remained true to her ideals of real beauty, 
        however, and has turned much of her interest to sponsoring and pr
        oviding art exhibitions for the public schools of the State. She 
        has established over thirty art collections, of from fifteen to f
        ifty paintings, by Utah's best RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE MARCH 1945
         artists. Hundreds of exhibitions have been held, and many thousa
        nds of dollars have thus been turned to Utah artists aside from t
        he greater value of instilling a love of beauty and art in the li
        ves of the younger generation. For fourteen years from 1902 to 19
        16 Mrs. Home was a member of the Relief Society General Board, an
        d while there was active in preparing lessons on art appreciation
         and landscape study, which were used by the 40,000 members of th
        e Relief Society. A book on this subject "Devotees and Their Shri
        nes, A Handbook of Art" was later published. Another book written
         in dramatic form called "Columbus Westward Ho!" was published an
        d used in the public schools for a time. Many other interests cla
        imed her attention during all these years of active service. She 
        is a charter member of the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers, and wa
        s instrumental in framing its constitution and bylaws; she was al
        so its second general president. She sponsored a "Clean Milk for 
        Utah" campaign, and as chairman of Public Health helped, with oth
        ers, to arouse enough public sentiment to cause rigid inspection 
        to be enforced for the benefit of all, especially babies. Four mi
        lk stations were opened in different parts of the city. Many babi
        es died in Salt Lake City among them her own baby son, George Hen
        ry, Jr.  while the next summer only one baby death was reported! 
        Mrs. Home was also active, with others, in organizing the Smokele
        ss Fuel Federation, and for many years has labored to encourage t
        he use of smokeless fuel and byproducts from Utah coals. She, wit
        h other forward-looking women, was instrumental in the formation 
        of the Women's Chamber of Commerce, which has labored to make smo
        keless fuel a possibility for improving the health of Utah reside
        nts and the beauty of her towns and cities. Honors Have Sought He
        r For her many activities, Mrs. Home has rightly received merited
         recognition. In 1904, she represented the National Council of Wo
        men, as well as the National Women's Relief Society, at the Inter
        national Council of Women, held in Berlin, Germany. In 1934, she 
        was chosen by the Salt Lake City Council of Women as one of the f
        irst outstanding women, named by that body, for her many contribu
        tions and life-long promotion of art among the citizens of the St
        ate. Her latest honor was received in 1942, when she was given a 
        Medal of Honor from the Academy of Western Culture for her civic 
        service, especially in the promotion of Utah art appreciation and
         production. A large reception was held in the President's Suite 
        at the Hotel Utah, with Mr. And Mrs. Alexander Schreiner, and Mr.
         And Mrs. Lee Greene Richards in charge of the ceremonies. Many p
        rominent Utahns came to meet the little lady so greatly honored. 
        All these awards have been richly deserved, and have done honor t
        o the donors as well as to the recipient. One might think that a 
        life so crowded with achievement would be enough for one small la

        rry on her home duties as well as her many public activities. Ali

         her best, it seems that the halo of white hair frames a face gro
        wing more mellow and charming with the passing years. Though now 
        approaching what some may designate as 'getting on in years," she
         still seems as young as ever, and is active in staging art exhib
        its in the Tea Room or a nine-window art show at Zion's Co-operat
        ive Mercantile Institution, or some school where art-appreciation
         is needed. When one sees her "toting" around the heavy pictures,
         placing them where they receive their best light, or may be seen
         to the best advantage (so that possible sales may reward the art
        ist), one feels to exclaim, "What a Woman!" How wise to foster a 
        life interest which may remain when children are grown and home t
        ies are lessened! How much better it is to have work to do that h
        elps others more than oneself, rather than to sit idly at home, a
        llowing or expecting one's children to "take care of one's old ag
        e." What a glorious thing is independence! Wliat an achievement t
        o know that one's life work is being well done, in spite of circu
        mstances or the passing years. Such a blessing is the well-earned
         reward of our gifted lady, Alice Merrill Home. And here, dear fr
        iend, while you are living and working, is our bouquet of appreci
        ation and admiration!

         anniversary of the lady's birthday. The time was spent in social
         converse, supper being announced at six p.m., when the guests re
        paired to the residence of Apostle H. J. Grant, where a sumptuous
         repast had been prepared for the occasion. The table was handsom

        amiable hostess, and her sister, Mrs. JuHa Woolley, with Miss Mag
        gie Ivins assisting, waited upon the ladies in the most charming 
        manner, and every one seemed to thoroughly enjoy themselves. Abou
        t ten o'clock the party broke up. Many good wishes were expressed
         for the lady who is a great favorite with her friends. May she l

        ed situation we see but few communications from this part of the 
        country in your valuable paper, hence the liberty I take in penni
        ng a few lines to you, hoping you will be kind enough to give the
        m space in your paper. We were organized May 31st, 1883, under th
        e direction of President McDonald, with Anna Klienman, President;
         Henrietta Standage and Laureta Staples, Counselors; Sarah M. Mul

        their religion and serve God. The Exponent is read in our meeting
        s, with other Church works, striving to render them a source of b

         build up the Kingdom of God in this far off land.... We have had
         a very pleasant winter and the health of the people is very good

        Utah State Senate. Years ago, President Brigham Young's daughter,
         Susa, attended a class in voice building at Harvard University, 
        taught by Miss Babcock. The pupil did not rest until Miss Babcock
         was in the employ of the University of Utah, where she built up 
        one of the best known speech departments in the country, serving 
        for fifty-two years, longer than any other faculty member. She be
        came a convert to the Church, was the first president of the Youn

      1 VOL. 32 MARCH 1945 NO. 3 Gratitude For Church Guidance ONE hundre
        d and three years will have passed this March seventeenth since t
        he first auxiliary of the Church, the Relief Society, was establi
        shed for the benefit of its members and for the good of others. I
        n that year, 1842, the Church had risen triumphant through its fi
        rst twelve momentous years. It had been driven from New York to O
        hio, from Missouri to Illinois, and already the necessary laws an
        d powers for the coming forth and future progress of the Church h
        ad been revealed and confirmed. It was during that all-too-brief 
        period of calm between the lashing storms of persecution, while t
        he Church lay, as it were, at safe anchorage on the broad blue wa
        ters of the Mississippi at Nauvoo, that a few of the Church women
         gave utterance to their longing to be formed into an organizatio
        n so that their united efforts might more speedily and effectuall
        y accomplish tasks allotted to them. It is significant that these
         women did not themselves inaugurate a society, but turned to the
        ir Prophet-leader for guidance. At a time and place set by him, h
        e organized them, and under his continued tutelage thus was insti
        tuted the Relief Society which grew in one hundred years from a m
        embership of eighteen to over one hundred thousand. The broad bas
        ic principles which Page 158 have always governed the Society wer
        e laid by the Prophet Joseph Smith; however the planning and putt
        ing into execution of these policies have always been entrusted t
        o the officers and members of the Society, who fully merited the 
        confidence thus reposed in them, manifesting a devotion to duty, 
        throughout the years, which has resulted in an immeasurable amoun
        t of labor, of loving service, and of enlightenment. Relief Socie
        ty is obedient to the leadership of Church authorities today as i
        t was one hundred years ago, and stands ready to accept and suppo
        rt new policies as they are deemed desirable. So guided and so co
        nducted, the advancing years will find the Society growing ever m
        ore powerful, more potent in building testimonies of the gospel i
        n members, more fully fulfilling its high destiny. On this one hu
        ndred and third anniversary, Relief Society members acknowledge t
        he gratitude of their hearts for the guidance of the general and 
        local authorities, for their zealous, watchful care to the end th
        at the services rendered by Relief Society women are being extend
        ed in everwidening spheres to keep pace with the accelerated need
         for such services in the expansion and progression of the Church

      1 EDITORIAL 159 Sarah Eddington?Ida Peterson Beal EARLY in the New 
        Year, two faithful and devoted former members of the General Boar
        d of Relief Society passed to the great beyond, in the persons of
         Sarah Eddington and Ida Peterson Beal. The death of Sister Eddin
        gton occurred on January 9, and that of Sister Beal on January 6.
         In many respects the lives of these two good sisters were simila
        r. They were both daughters of early Utah pioneers, were reared i
        n families where faith and devotion to the gospel were paramount,
         and their testimonies of the mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith
         and the restored gospel were fervent and strong. Miss Eddington 
        was born June 13, 1861 in Salt Lake City. She was the daughter of
         William and Sarah Fry Eddington, English converts. From her chil
        dhood days she was active in the Church in many capacities. She s
        erved as a valued member of the General Board of Relief Society f
        or seven years ?from March 1914 to April 1921. Previous to this s
        he was a member of the General Board of the Y. W. M. LA. For twen
        ty-five years. She was an untiring worker, always willing to do m
        ore than her share. She was an efficient committee member and tra
        velled extensively for both the Relief Society and the Y. W. M. I
        A. Although she was rather frail and delicate physically, she use
        d to say, "Send me on the long, hard trips; I have no home to tak
        e care of, no husband, and no children. I am free and my chief in
        terest in life is the Church and its progress." Sister Eddington 
        was especially gifted as a public speaker. She was both eloquent 
        and impressive, and was always able to hold her audience whether 
        it was made up of children, young people, or those of mature year
        s. IDA PETERSON BEAL was born in Ephraim, Sanpete County, Utah, o
        n February 7, 1876, the daughter of President Canute Peterson and
         Chariotte Eckstrom Peterson. Her Church interests and activities
         began early and continued throughout her life in the various aux
        iliary organizations of the Church. She was appointed to the Gene
        ral Board of Relief Society in August 1927, where she served fait
        hfully and efficiently for thirteen years. Sister Beal received h
        er education in the schools of her native town, at the Snow Acade
        my, and at the Brig-ham Young University. In the last named insti
        tution she majored in music under the tutelage of Professor A. C.
         Lund, and became one of his star pupils and one of the sweetest 
        singers in Zion. She took the leading role in the first opera pro
        duced by Brigham Young University. Sister Beal had many opportuni
        ties for study and travel, and she made the most of them. She acc
        ompanied her husband, Dean T. A. Beal of the University of Utah, 
        to
      2 New York where, for three years, he studied at Columbia Universit
        y. She later accompanied him to Europe where, for one year, they 
        both took advantage of educational and cultural opportunities the
        re. Probably Sister Berit's greatest contribution to the General 
        Board was as chairman of the music committee in which capacity sh
        e directed the annual
      3 organization, and was instrumental in developing the great centra
        l chorus of Singing Mothers. However, she travelled extensively t
        o stake Night Society conferences where her lovely spirit and swe
        et personality won friends and supporters to the great Relief Soc
        iety cause.

         which covered the materials that would be needed for the 1945 we
        lfare clothing budget assignment. At that time, information which
         had previously been supplied by government officials in Washingt
        on indicated that it was probable that the materials for this clo
        thing assignment would be made available to the Welfare Program. 
        In the latter part of December the situation changed and it then 
        became apparent that most of the materials, which we proposed to 
        use, were still critically needed in the war effort. It has, ther
        efore, been decided that while present conditions exist, it will 
        not be advisable to file for priorities. The clothing program wil
        l proceed as materials become available to which we are properly 
        entitled on a quota basis. The most recent information from the w
        holesale houses with which the General Committee has heretofore d
        one business is that there is no immediate prospect of securing t
        he clothing materials in the quantities that are required to fill
         the 1945 budget assignment. It is the plan of the General Commit
        tee to keep in close touch with the market and take advantage of 
        the full quota of materials as they become available. This means 
        that it will not be possible for the General Committee to supply 
        the materials needed so that the budget can be completed during t
        he first six months of this year as many of the Relief Society si
        sters desire. It is hoped, however, that materials will be availa
        ble so that the budget can be completed by the end of 1945. As ma
        terials are received, they will be allocated in a fair manner to 
        those to whom the budgets have been assigned. The question has ar
        isen as to whethei stake or ward welfare committees shall be enco
        uraged to purchase materials from lo cal sources to complete thei
        r clothing assignments. If materials can be purchased at wholesal
        e prices without working a hardship on the community, it will be 
        proper for the stake and ward welfare committees to purchase such
         materials and advise the General Committee so that the General C
        ommittee will not overpurchase later on. However, if it is necess
        ary to go into the retail markets and pay retail prices and take 
        from the shelves of local merchants materials that are needed to 
        meet the general needs of the local community, such purchases sho
        uld not be made. Where quilting is done, the General Committee ca
        n supply the batts needed from stocks now on hand. During the tim
        e that materials for welfare sewing are not available, the Genera
        l Board recommends that Relief Society women devote themselves to
         other sewing activities on the work meeting day. Page 161

       1 Marshalling Our Forces for Home Safety Nellie O. Parker Member o
         f Relief Society General Board Chairman Home Division, Utah Safe
         ty Council WHILE the best of the country's young manhood are giv
         ing their lives that we here at home may be safe and free, the a
         ccident casualties every year in our homes are more than 35,000 
         killed and 120,000 permanently injured, to no purpose and withou
         t good reason.
       2 More than half of all accidents occur in and around the homes, a
         nd the greatest percentage of the victims are children under fiv
         e and elderly people over sixty-five years of age. They are vict
         ims of ignorance, of carelessness, recklessness or neglect. Acci
         dents do not happen, they are caused by some unsafe practice or 
         condition.
       3 The first National Home Farm Safety Conference was held in Chica
         go, February 17-18, 1942, to focus attention on the seriousness 
         of the nation's home and farm accident situation, and to afford 
         an opportunity for an open discussion of the problem so that pla
         ns could be made for a nation-wide safety program. As a result o
         f this study, the Home and Farm Safety divisions were added to t
         he National Safety Council program. Since then, a majority of th
         e states have included a home and a farm safety division in thei
         r safety organizations.
       4 Utah has kept in step with the na-
       5 Traffic Safety Council was organized in 1939. In 1942, the State
          ranked second to Oregon in the Western Division for the best tr
         affic safety record, and, in 1943, received the national grand a
         ward in the traffic safety contest.
       6 The Utah Safety Council was formed May 19, 1944. Its scope was e
         xpanded to include the activities of the Utah Traffic Safety Cou
         ncil, the Women's Safety Council of Utah, and all other groups w
         orking in the interest of safety. The consolidation of these gro
         ups work under one head was made in the interest of efficiency a
         nd against duplication of effort.
       7 The Home Division is new in the State and, as in the National Co
         uncil, is in the pioneer stages of its plans.
       8 A great nation-wide program has been inaugurated in which all ou
         r forces are harnessed to bring a safety consciousness to all Am
         ericans. The greatest stress is being placed on education and en
         gineering, two of the three "E's" of safety. Enforcement, the th
         ird factor, cannot be used in the home as in industry and traffi
         c.
       9 This program of education should disseminate the knowledge of th
         e safe use of the many products of this machine age that have fo
         und their way into our daily living. Individuals must be made co
         nscious of unsafe conditions and unsafe practices.
      10 Page 162 MARSHALLING OUR FORCES FOR HOME SAFETY 163. They should
          be awakened to a personal responsibility in guarding their own 
         safety as well as that of others, and should exert every energy 
         to assure their freedom from accidental injury. The importance o
         f teaching safety in the home is being recognized as the first r
         equisite in the safety program. It is believed that a child brou
         ght up in an atmosphere of safety will not be content with unsaf
         e conditions and practices in later years, and that this trainin
         g wiH have a profound influence on safety problems in general?in
          the home, on the highway, in industry. To assist in the educati
         on for home safety, the Red Cross has added another service?cour
         ses of instruction in accident prevention. It is now offering a 
         course "Home Accident Prevention." Tliere is need, at present, f
         or certified teachers to impart this knowledge to all groups of 
         people. Those who take and fulfill all the requirements of this 
         course can become certified teachers. It is an opportunity to he
         lp conserve human life, and also to destroy one of the potent fo
         rces which lead to distress and suffering. The Home Division of 
         the Utah Safety Council is sponsoring classes in home accident p
         revention as a part of its program of education for home safety.
          It is issuing an appeal to people, in all groups and walks of l
         ife, to take advantage of the course not only for the benefit to
          themselves in their own homes, but also for the opportunity it 
         gives them to do a fine human service. The Home Division is also
          planning for a designated week from April 8-14 wherein home saf
         ety can be specifically emphasized by all means available?by rad
         io, by the press, by programs in churches, clubs, and schools, a
         nd by exhibits and surveys. It is hoped that by these activities
          a public awareness to the existence of hazards may be awakened,
          and a general desire to remove or avoid them be stimulated. The
          world would be a much better place in which to live if accident
         s could be prevented and, by marshalling all our forces to this 
         end, much can be accomplished.

     March_extracts/22_March_Designs_for_Summer.txt
       1 March Designs For Summer Hazel D. Moyle OF all the year's calend
         ar, March is the least loved month. . . . And passing few are th
         ey who speak, wild, stormy month, in praise of thee." . . . Yet 
         March has an important place in the year's garden work.
       2 It is true that we can do but little out of doors at this early 
         season?a fact which we soon discover when we venture out into ou
         r wet and sodden flower beds. But we can find solace, at this ti
         me of year, for that first hunger for green growing things which
          springs up so violently in the breast of every garden lover. We
          can not only elect our winter-weary selves, but we can assure o
         ur gardens an early and abundant bloom next summer by starting s
         eeds indoors in early March.
       3 Certain vegetables can also be started indoors with profit; that
          intriguing new tomato, "Change Jubilee" must be grown from your
          own sowing of seeds if you are to enjoy its piquant flavor and 
         unusual appearance come next August, for few nurserymen offer re
         ady-grown plants of this new variety.
       4 One can, it is true, now purchase most kinds of annuals all read
         ygrown for planting out when May arrives, but such ready-made pl
         ants under the present war conditions command a fairly high pric
         e. If your planting spaces are large, it will certainly pay you 
         to try to raise your own plants. One can, if she is successful, 
         reap an entire garden-full of plants by means of a few packages 
         of seeds plus a little honest effort.
       5 And there is the added advantage of being able to select just th
         ose colors, varieties, and kinds that suit one's own personal ta
         stes.
       6 It is especially profitable to make early March sowings of such 
         annuals as the following: petunia, the most brilliant blooming o
         f all (plant the low bedding varieties for garden decoration, an
         d the giant ruffled kinds for cutting); lobelia, that tiny low-e
         dging plant of such blazing, glowing blue color; snapdragon, riv
         aling petunias for constant all-year bloom, plus variety in colo
         ring (we plant many shades of pink, flame, yellow, and crimson);
          verbena, these soon completely cover any wide space with a gorg
         eous, low carpet of fragrant color; stock . . . Ah me! the lovel
         y, clean perfume of blossoming stocks; and ageratum, flower of s
         oft blue, an exquisite peacemaker among our flower beds (plant t
         his near the front line). All of these need an early start indoo
         rs if you are to have them blossoming from late June and on unti
         l snow flies.
       7 THE requirements for indoor seed planting are few. Foremost is a
          suitable room in which to keep the seed boxes. The ordinary, we
         ll heated living room is too hot and dry for really good results
         . Choose, if you can, a cooler room, one that is light and airy,
          and where you can have plenty of ventilation. It should have at
          least one good sunny window. You might make use of your kitchen
          to keep the boxes when the seeds are germinating, for they can 
         be kept in any warm room under a table out of the way at this st
         age, but the moment the tiny things begin to push up the soil, t
         hey must have light and air. An unheated, sunny room would be id
         eal after they are up.
       8 Use a wooden box four inches deep and from twelve to eighteen in
         ches long; too much depth of soil is not conducive to healthy gr
         owth, yet it should be deep enough to accommodate the young root
         s.
       9 The soil used is of the greatest of importance; you should mix t
         his as carefully as you would your Christmas pudding. A sandy so
         il is best, and some experts use one-third pure sand, one-third 
         good clean dirt, and the last third, real black leaf mold or hou
         sewives' garden compost. You may be able to purchase a small sac
         k of soil all mixed and ready to use from some florist or nurser
         yman, should you not have the above ingredients, and this might 
         be the means of your real success in the venture.
      10 A layer of broken flower pots, small pebbles, and coarse peat mo
         ss should be placed in the bottom of the seed box, then the prep
         ared and sifted soil is placed over this rough drainage to fill 
         the box to within one-half inch of the top. Press the whole down
          firmly with some board or even a paper magazine to insure no ai
         r pockets, especially at corners and edges. Then you are ready f
         or the sowing of seeds.

       1 The Lonesome House Olive Woolley Burt GRANDMA JACKSON never did 
         know just what made her choose a different route home on that su
         nny, spring day. It might have been, she realized later, the inv
         itation in the south wind that reminded her so of her birthplace
         ; or it might have been the red and yellow tulips in the yard ne
         xt to Let-tie's, flaunting their individuality almost insolently
         . But whatever the cause, Grandma Jackson did not turn east at t
         he drugstore corner as she should have done. She went west, inst
         ead, and walked two blocks out of her way just so she could pass
          the park, brave in its new spring dress. Having passed the park
         , Grandma Jackson didn't even then turn toward Will's house, but
          wandered along slowly, savoring the sweetness of spring that wa
         s carried to her country-born senses by the soft breeze. She cam
         e, finally, to a little side street and turned down it, just bec
         ause it was something like a country lane, with the street unpav
         ed, a ditch of clear water running beside the curb, and tall tre
         es arching over the sidewalk. And it was down this little side s
         treet, just about the middle of the block, that Grandma Jackson 
         came upon the little house. It was an old, weather-beaten house,
          set back from the shady street in a yard overgrown with grass a
         nd flowers. Crocuses and daffodils, tulips and hyacinths, that a
         nd once apparently been planted in neat borders along the walk, 
         now sprang up everywhere in the lush grass, making the shaggy la
         wn a veritable crazy patch of gay color. Grandma Jackson put her
          hand on the rickety gate and looked wistfully into the yard. It
          was so homelike, so poignantly familiar ? it looked so much the
          way she felt-little and old and gray, but with vivid, insurgent
          thoughts. She pushed the gate gently and it swung open, so she 
         went down the neglected walk. The house was obviously empty. The
          wide porch across the front sagged toward the grassy earth, but
          Grandma Jackson didn't notice that. She was thinking what a nic
         e porch it would be to sit on of an evening, rocking and dreamin
         g till time to go to bed. She crossed the porch and peered in at
          the dusty, small-paned windows. She couldn't see much except th
         e bright squares of sunlight on the bare, wooden floor. She went
          to the door and tried the knob gently; and, when the door yield
         ed, she shrugged her small bent shoulders and walked resolutely 
         in and looked around. There were two rooms. In the one which Gra
         ndma Jackson instinctively called the living room were three win
         dows, two facing south and one west. They'd get all the winter s
         un there is, she thought, seeing her little rocking chair there 
         between the two windows, a crocheted rug beneath her feet, a gra
         y Page 167 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?MARCH 1945 cat purring conten
         tedly in the patch of sunlight. She went into the bedroom and si
         ghed. It was just the right size for her old-fashioned bed and h
         ighboy. In the little lean-to kitchen, an old rusty cook stove h
         ad been left, and Grandma Jackson's lips curved into a tender sm
         ile at sight of it. It was on just such a stove that she had don
         e her first cooking for William; it was at just such a stove he 
         had used to sit of a winter evening, his stockinged feet in the 
         open oven. There was nothing like a coal stove for real warmth a
         nd comfort, Grandma Jackson told herself softly. Let the young f
         olks have their furnaces and their gas and oil?a good coal stove
          was the thing to warm old bones by. She tried the back door, an
         d found it, too, unlocked, so she went into the little back yard
         , fenced in, and overgrown with currant bushes, a small strawber
         ry patch, and grass everywhere. She heard a trickle and looked a
         bout her and found the reason for the lush greenishness. A very 
         tiny spring bubbled through the tangled mass at one side of the 
         yard and ran down a choked ditch to join the ditch along the cur
         b in the front. Grandma Jackson smiled triumphantly, as if she h
         ad discovered a looked for treasure. That was why this street wa
         s different from all the others. There must be several of these 
         small springs along the block and they gave that special lovelin
         ess to the grass and the trees. It was a long time before Grandm
         a Jackson could tear herself away from the little house. She lov
         ed it already, as if they two had some secret affinitv. But she 
         knew she shouldn't stay so long. Will's wife, Clara, would be wo
         rried. If Lettie had phoned as she usually did to see whether he
         r mother had made the short trip from her house to her brother's
          safely, they would all be out searching for her. They always to
         ld her to go straight along, and here she had flagrantly ignored
          their advice. She pulled the doors shut carefully and went slow
         ly down the path and out of the rickety gate. She looked back fr
         om the sidewalk, and the house peered at her lonesomely from the
          two windows, the porch roof bent like a wistful eyebrow above t
         hem. Grandma Jackson waved gently, to reassure the little house,
          then squared her shoulders and turned her face purposefully tow
         ard her son's house. She arrived before Lettie phoned, before th
         ere was any uproar over her vagary. She went to her room and too
         k off her hat, and hung it carefully in the crowded little close
         t. She looked at her beloved old bed? a piece of furniture Clara
          hated? and touched the pieced quilt gently as she passed. It wo
         uld look just right?but she musn't think of that. Downstairs she
          looked about for her rocker. This had grown to be an unconsciou
         s gesture on her part, derived from the habit Clara had of movin
         g Grandma's rocker from place to place in the room, so it wouldn
         't wear the nap off the carpet. Grandma saw where the little cha
         ir now stood and went to it and sat down and tried to knit, but 
         the chair was in a dark corner, and her eyes were dim, and she w
         as dreadfully tired, so she just sat. Will's two grandchildren, 
         noisy and dirty, came into the living room THE LONESOME HOUSE an
         d began to climb over Grandma and her chair. She loved the littl
         e fellows, but their hands were sticky. If she got up and took c
         are of them, Clara and Trudy would be offended, taking it as an 
         insult to their own care of the children. So Grandma shrank into
          herself as much as she could, and let the boys have their way u
         ncomplaining. That night Grandma Jackson dreamed of the little h
         ouse. It was furnished with her own things, and she was living i
         n it quietly, happily. Her children and their children and grand
         children came to see her and she was glad to have them because, 
         in her own house, she could gently but firmly keep them in their
          places. She awoke and lay staring into the dark, and the longin
         g for the little gray house became so acute it was a physical ac
         hing. But it was useless. There was no way to relieve the ache. 
         If she had only saved a little money! But how could she, with fo
         ur children to rear and educate? They had all had such good mind
         s ?such great possibilities. She had scrimped and saved, and the
         n spent freely to send them to college, to get them established 
         in their chosen fields. She sighed and turned over and determine
         d to sleep. What couldn't be cured must be endured, she knew fro
         m past years of wanting and going without. But she couldn't keep
          back the tears that squeezed under the soft wrinkled lids with 
         their thin gray lashes; she couldn't stop the ache that tortured
          her old, tired heart. THE next afternoon Grandma Jackson put on
          her straw bonnet and took her knitting bag and said, almost too
          casually, "Well, Clara, it's such a nice day, I think I?ll take
          a little walk." Clara looked at her mother-in-law, surprised. "
         Why don't you wait till it's cooler?" she shouted, and Grandma J
         ackson shuddered involuntarily. Clara always yelled at her in th
         e belief that she was deaf, and Grandma's quiet assurances to th
         e contrary had no effect. "I'll just walk down the shady side of
          the street," Grandma protested. "But you may get a sunstroke!" 
         Clara fussed. "Lots of old people do, walking in the sun." "I'll
          keep in the shade," Grandma repeated, determined not to be talk
         ed out of her little excursion. "Well," Clara was openly doubtfu
         l. "Don't go too far, I'll be worried till you get back. I'll be
          watching out for you." "No, don't Clara," Grandma begged. "If I
          get a wee bit tired, I'll stop in at Anabelle Truman's. She's b
         een begging me to come, and I'm taking my knitting along." Grand
         ma saw the triumphant look that leaped into Clara's eyes, and sm
         iled secretly. Clara thought she had slyly found out where Grand
         ma was going. She smiled sweetly at the old woman now. "Be caref
         ul crossing the streets," she shouted, and Grandma escaped into 
         the afternoon sun. She walked demurely enough down the street to
         ward her old friend's house, and right on past. She turned the c
         orner and hurried along, straight to the little side street, str
         aight to the rickety gate halfway down the block. There Grandma 
         Jackson stopped and waved greeting to the little lonesome house.
          It was just as she RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?MARCH 1945 had remem
         bered it! It hadn't been a dream. Grandma pushed open the gate a
         nd walked up the path to the porch. She sat down on the low step
         , took off her hat, and laid her knitting bag beside her. When G
         randma Jackson realized she was thirsty, she remembered the litt
         le spring, and went around the house to the back. There was noth
         -ink to drink from, so she knelt on the grass and scooped up the
          cold water in her wrinkled old hands and drank it lovingly, gra
         tefully. She was suddenly young again, with young William laughi
         ng beside her. She got up carefully and went to the back stoop a
         nd sat there, thinking of William and of their children. Suddenl
         y, Grandma Jackson realized that when she thought of her childre
         n she never thought of them as they were now?grown men and women
          with children of their own. She thought of them as babies at he
         r breast, as little folks starting off to school, as youngsters 
         with problems of their own they brought to her, even as laughing
          soldiers going off to the last war?but never as middle-aged ind
         ividuals ? never as married folk. Somehow, she had to admit to h
         erself, they didn't seem much like her children any more. She wi
         shed that she had been able to keep one of them, at least, hers.
          Then she shook her head impatiently, she didn't wish any such t
         hing. At last. Grandma got up with a sigh, went around to the fr
         ont and, picking up her hat and knitting bag, she started home a
         gain. That was the first of her secret visits to the little hous
         e. As the days passed and the delight of spring grew into the re
         ality of summer. Grandma's little afternoon walk became such a h
         abit that Clara forgot to wonder and to ask questions. She had e
         vidently talked it over with Will and Lettie, and they'd made up
          their minds to let her alone in her queer vagary. All old folks
          had some strange ways, and this was harmless. Grandma Jackson w
         as glad for this acquiescence, and she took every advantage of t
         heir apparent indifference. First, it was Will's pruning shears.
          She had noticed that the currant bushes would have to be trimme
         d back, so she slipped the shears into her knitting bag one day,
          and when she got to the little house, she hurried around to the
          back yard and set to work. The pruning done, the uncouth state 
         of the strawberry bed cried aloud for correction, so the next af
         ternoon, Grandma Jackson pulled strawberry suckers till her hand
         s were sore and her legs trembled, and her back ached, but she w
         as happier than she had been for years. Bit by bit, the back yar
         d took on a more civilized air, and the bushes and vines, as if 
         grateful for attention, sent out showers of fragrant blossoms. T
         he old lilac tree was so burdened that Grandma picked an armful 
         of the lovely flowers, and then, not knowing how to explain them
          at home, she looked about for some way of keeping them here. Sh
         e put them in an old bucket and set them inside the door, and th
         e next day she went out of her way to go to the five-and-ten cen
         t store to get a crock to put the blossoms in. In the store, she
          saw a tiny teakettle THE LONESOME HOUSE 171 and she suddenly th
         ought how nice it would be to have a cup of postum of an afterno
         on when she had finished her work. So she bought the teakettle a
         nd some postum and wafers. TT was by easy stages like this, that
          Grandma Jackson moved into the empty house. At first, she sat o
         n an old box, but one day Claude tucked a little check into his 
         letter? a thing he frequently did?and Grandma bought a tiny seco
         nd-hand rocker, and had it delivered, giving the man explict dir
         ections to put it in the back yard, as she wouldn't be there 'wi
         th her other things" for a day or two. And once the rocking chai
         r was placed between the two windows, it would have taken more r
         esolution than Grandma possessed to convince herself that she wa
         s trespassing, or that she had no right to these harmless aftern
         oons. AT home, Lettie and Will and Clara mentioned how much happ
         ier Grandma looked. Will said, "Well, Grandma, I guess those aft
         ernoon walks of yours are just what you need. Maybe we've kept y
         ou too cooped up. You look better than you have in all the years
          since father died." Nobody bothered Grandma in her little house
         . No one ever came to the door or gave any sign of being interes
         ted in what went on there. That is until one afternoon, when the
          woman who lived next door, whom Grandma had sometimes seen in h
         er little yard hanging out clothes or playing with her three chi
         ldren, came dashing over, her hair all tumbled, her eyes frantic
         . She pounded on the back door and Grandma Jackson opened it fea
         rfully. Seeing the frightened creature before her, Grandma Jacks
         on wanted to say "Come in! Tell me what's wrong!" but she couldn
         't do that, so she stepped out onto the little porch, pulled the
          kitchen door shut behind her, and asked, "What's the matter?" "
         My baby!" the woman gasped. "Something has happened to her. Can'
         t you hear her screaming? I don't know what's the matter! I can'
         t get a doctor? someone's on the line and won't let me have it. 
         I'm frantic?" Grandma Jackson didn't wait to hear any more. She 
         hurried along, her little old legs taking her through a gap in t
         he fence, past the frightened mother. Yes, she could hear the ba
         by screaming, the particularly anguished cries that accompany se
         vere and unidentified agony. Grandma Jackson picked the child up
          and held her a moment, watching her carefully. Then the wrinkle
         d, experienced fingers began to feel carefully over the little l
         egs and body and arms. As the gentle pressure reached the child'
         s face and ear, the screams became more piercing, and the child 
         shrank under the soft touch. Her two little brothers, watching, 
         frightened, began to cry. "It's her ear," Grandma Jackson said. 
         "Has she put something in her ear?" "She couldn't!" cried the mo
         ther, "she hasn't had anything small enough!" Grandma Jackson lo
         oked at the two little boys, but the mother flung her arm around
          them. "Not them, either!" she cried. "Baby was lying on her qui
         lt in her play pen on the lawn. They couldn't have reached her."
       2 "It's an ant then," said Grandma. "Get me some warm oil and a wa
         rm linen rag."
       3 While the mother was getting the materials, Grandma soothed the 
         baby, then she laid her on her left side and very carefully pour
         ed the warm oil into the tiny ear. She laid the warm linen again
         st it and fanned the child over on her right side.
       4 Gradually the sobs began to moderate, and in a very short while 
         the exhausted baby slept against Grandma's lap, with only an occ
         asional sob to remind them of what she had been through.
       5 Grandma removed the linen and held it toward the mother. On it l
         ay a black ant, drugged by the oil.
       6 When Grandma Jackson laid the baby gently in her crib and took t
         he small boys' hands to tiptoe with them from the room, the moth
         er said, "I don't know how I can thank you, Mrs.?"
       7 "Jackson," said Grandma. "Mrs. Jackson," she repeated, the phras
         e pleasing her with its recognition of her as something besides 
         a grandmother.
       8 "It must have been terribly painful. Won't you have a glass of c
         ool lemonade before you leave?"
       9 So Grandma Jackson sat down and drank lemonade with her neighbor
         .
      10 "You don't know how glad I am that you're my neighbor," Mrs. Coo
         k said, sincerely, after they had introduced themselves. "I am s
         o dumb with the children. When anything happens I go all to piec
         es. I'm sure I came over to welcome you before," she explained, 
         a little ashamed that she had not met this kind old woman until 
         necessity demanded it, "but you are there so seldom?". She hesit
         ated and flushed, and Grandma Jackson knew that this little woma
         n must have peered through the windows, must have seen the barre
         n rooms.

       1 Rehabilitation of Disabled Soldiers and Sailors Excerpts from a 
         Report, Office of War Information THE readjustment and happiness
          of wounded soldiers and sailors with compassionate physical dis
         figurements or disabilities or nervous manifestations will depen
         d in large measure on the way their families and friends and the
          public at large behave toward them.
       2 Thanks to modern therapy, many of the men suffering from even th
         e severest wounds will be rehabilitated and enabled to lead live
         s of normal activity, engaging in industry, business or professi
         ons. But the most modern medical and psychiatric care, the fines
         t surgery and appliance, expert rehabilitation, vocational train
         ing and employment opportunities are far from being all that is 
         needed by the men who have suffered disfigurements and disabilit
         ies. The OWI passes along a number of suggestions, made by the S
         urgeon General of the Army, concerning everyday behavior on the 
         part of friends, family and acquaintances most calculated to les
         sen the inevitable difficulties of adjustment of disfigured and 
         disabled veterans.
       3 If a formerly able-bodied man returns from combat with a disfigu
         rement or other serious disability, he is almost certain to be e
         motionally disturbed. In other cases the wound he brings back ma
         y be mental.
       4 In case after case, maimed young men have been freed from their 
         black thoughts and bitterness, and have had their self-confidenc
         e restored, by the professional?expert and difficult?rehabilitat
         ion treatment they have received, as soon as possible after inju
         ry, in Army and Navy hospitals and in the hospitals of the Veter
         ans' Administration. Disabled merchant seamen are cared for in U
         nited States Public Health Service Marine Hospitals.
       5 In all these institutions, the restoration of self-confidence, a
         s an aid in the restoration of physical health, is the immediate
          aim of doctors, nurses, and other personnel.
       6 Details of accomplishments in the field of physical rehabilitati
         on are becoming increasingly familiar to American readers of new
         spapers and magazines. Injured muscles are brought back into pla
         y, new or unused muscles are trained. When necessary, efficient 
         surgical appliances are carefully fitted to replace amputated ha
         nds, feet or limbs.
       7 Nervous disabilities resulting from combat experience are treate
         d with equal care. In some cases prolonged psychiatric treatment
          is necessary; occupational therapy cures others rapidly.
       8 When he has recovered his physical or psychic health and is disc
         harged from the Army or Navy hospital, the serviceman in need of
          vocational training is eligible to receive it from the Veterans
         ' Administration if he has suffered a ten percent or greater dis
         ability, resulting in a vocational handicap, while in service.
       9 Page 176 REHABILITATION OF DISABLED SOLDIERS AND SAILORS 177 If 
         not, the same training is open to him through the Vocational Reh
         abihtation Division of the United States Office of Education. Vo
         cational training in the Veterans* Administration and other inst
         itutions is directed toward preparing the wounded man not only t
         o fill a job in which his wound will not be a handicap, but to d
         o important work which he will enjoy and for which he is tempera
         mentally suited. In all cases, even those capable only of self-e
         mployment at home, the goal is useful, functional, independent l
         iving?not dependent, permanent residence in hospitals. After voc
         ational training comes employment, and here many agencies are wo
         rking for the wounded serviceman. In summary, Americans can rest
          assured that their wounded soldiers and sailors are being given
          the most modem medical and psychiatric care, the finest surgery
          and appliances, expert rehabilitation, vocational training and 
         finally employment opportunities that confirm their hard-won fee
         lings of independence. All these things are being provided, and 
         provided by persons and organizations expert in their field, pro
         fessionally equipped to further the welfare of wounded ex-servic
         emen. BUT the American people?the families, friends and acquaint
         ances of the disabled and disfigured men, and the public at larg
         e?have a responsibility in the matter, too. It is up to them to 
         further the men's progress during rehabilitation by considerate 
         and cooperative behavior. Men who are working hard to acquire ne
         w self-confidence, or who have acquired it, must not be jolted o
         ut of it by thoughtless, uncontrolled manifestations of pity or 
         horror or distaste or false cheeriness or too-eager curiosity or
          other emotionalism. For the purpose of increasing public awaren
         ess of some of the problems faced by disabled and disfigured men
          in their search for rehabilitation and normal living, and for t
         he purpose of indicating to what extent public cooperation can b
         e of benefit, the Surgeon General of the Army has set forth a se
         ries of guide-posts not only for the families and friends of suc
         h men, but for all who may come in contact vdth them. The sugges
         tions are intended especially for the period of rehabilitation i
         n hospitals or vocational training centers, but they also hold g
         ood for later, after the wounded men's return to civilian life: 
         1. Treat the maimed person as the normal person he always has be
         en and continues to be. Disfigurement does not make him into a d
         ifferent person, though it may well result in his growing to be 
         a bigger one. If you are disturbed by the disfigurement, discipl
         ine yourself so that your disturbance is not apparent. It is up 
         to you to make him realize-without talking about it?that you fee
         l about him exactly as always, and that his disfigurement is uni
         mportant compared with your affection or friendship. The only di
         fference could be an even increased respect for him. There is mu
         ch to be gained from contact with a person who has suffered a ha
         ndicap and overcome it. Such a person often gains extraordinary 
         largeness of character from his RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?MARCH 19
         45 fight and his success; and those around him, in turn, gain fr
         om his example. Treating disabled men as normal people is partic
         ularly important in cases of mental disability. Often, in cases 
         of this kind, the average person retains ancient prejudices, and
          approaches a patient either with distaste or as though he were 
         a child or a fool. It should be kept in mind that vast strides h
         ave been made in recent years in the treatment and rehabilitatio
         n of the mentally and nervously afflicted. They are simply ill?a
         nd their illnesses are usually curable. It should be emphasized 
         also that excessive praise of a disabled man because of his disa
         bility is not helpful. 2. Don't ask questions or give advice. Th
         e man who has been disabled or disfigured may want to talk about
          himself or he may not. Respect his wishes. Do not mention the d
         isfigurement unless he does. If he does not want to talk about h
         imself, talk about things he is interested in, or about objects 
         in the room, or hobbies, or details of common interest. Don't ta
         lk about the war or about subjects related to his injury. Don't 
         pry or hint. The best answer to give a wounded man who asks you 
         "Am I going to be good for anything?" is "If you want to be good
          for something, determination helps." If you are related to a wo
         unded or disfigured man, make it your business to know about the
          rehabilitation and accomplishments of persons as badly handicap
         ped as he is, or more so, and be able to tell him about them ?no
         t in a preachy way, but factually. Let him see that you know abo
         ut them and that you assume he will take full advantage of his o
         pportunities. 3. Be casual and lealistic?not over cheery. The ma
         n you are visiting may feel depressed. It is his right to feel s
         o. It is an offense to his dignity and his common sense to go in
         to a routine of transparent "cheeriness." The express intent of 
         cheering up is seldom convincing or effective. Nor is it usually
          convincing or beneficial to try to minimize the crippling effec
         t of maiming. By facing the reality ofc a man's disability yours
         elf, you can help him face it. Personal anxieties and problems o
         f all kinds lose their capacity to frighten if they are brought 
         out into the open, squarely faced and talked about. A disfigured
          man who finds his friends acting naturally and casually about h
         is disfigurement will more easily avoid being the kind of person
          who goes through life shrinking if a child asks, ''What's the m
         atter with that man?" If a person has one leg, it is better to a
         dmit that fact and not try to conceal it. If one is deaf, the he
         aring aid should be worn openly, not treated as an embarrassing 
         detail. A hearing aid or an artificial leg is just that and noth
         ing more. The only difference it makes is that one hears or walk
         s better with it than without it. 4. Don't wait on the injured m
         an too much. Even though a disabled soldier or sailor be surroun
         ded with sympathy, waited on hand and foot by nurses and given c
         ountless attentions, he may still despair. He may still view him
         self as a martyr-an attitude REHABILITATION OF DISABLED SOLDIERS
          AND SAILORS 179 which brings little happiness to him and no ben
         efit to anybody else. If his faith in his ability to do things i
         s restored the rest of the treatment is easy.
      10 If there is something the patient can do for you, let him do it.

      3 "Men see not the bright light which is in the clouds"?Job 37:21.
      4 HOW desolate, how colorless, how unattractive the world would be 
        without its blue canopy! To the beauty of the seeing eye, it is G
        od's moving picture screen, constantly changing, constantly thril
        ling the human heart with its beauty.
      5 Take the dawn of the morning?did you ever watch it break across t
        he eastern horizon?the glory of the stars, as the sun's bright ra
        ys dissolve them?the blueness of the sky against the mistiness of
         dew? All these are beautiful to the nature-loving eye of man. Bu
        t it is the glow of sunset, the tinted clouds, the magic rivers, 
        lakes and mountains that are formed from them just at the close o
        f the day, that leave one speechless with awe and wonder.
      6 A sunset view, like that from my garden, recently brought to my m
        ind the quotation of Job?Job whose body was tormented with diseas
        e, who alone and lonesome?who never lost faith in God nor lost si
        ght of the bright light of the clouds to which so many were blind
        .
      7 Let us keep our eyes upon the bright lights of the clouds; they w
        ill give us the courage to struggle on when despair grips our sou
        ls; they will give us a new interest in beauty when the beauty of
         the world seems clouded against us; they point to God?a silent, 
        steadfast witness?and rarely can one look upon the bright, light 
        clouds and fail to feel the nearness of the Creator. Let us keep 
        our eyes turned towards the beautiful things of life and not be a
        s Job says, men who see not the bright light of the clouds.

       1 No Tongue Can Tell Marguerite J. Griffin "OUT there we talk of d
         eath quite calmly," said a young sailor, home on leave after see
         ing action in the South Pacific. "We talk over what has happened
          to this one and that one of our friends. We never spare the det
         ails. We talk of death quite as matter-of-factly, as if we were 
         discussing a newspaper item. We might as well. It's all around u
         s out there, and we know it. I've seen more things than I can te
         ll you."
       2 He was much changed, this young man, from what he had been when 
         he had gone away. Two years older? Yes, but more than that. His 
         ordinarily fair-skinned face was bronzed from the rigors of sea 
         life. But there were shadows across his brow, faint ones easily 
         removed by his ready smile, but still lurking there in moments o
         f repose. There was a firm new purpose to his jaw, as though, wh
         atever his naval rank, he was master of himself no matter what t
         he days might bring. And all this change because he had seen mor
         e things than tongue can tell. Physical suffering he had seen be
         cause he served with the medical corps. Death he had seen. Men d
         ying before his very eyes. Men dying without a whimper, without 
         a complaint.
       3 "After one bombing we went about on deck helping the wounded. Th
         ey were lying all about. I saw a fellow who had been my best fri
         end lying over his gun. I thought he was dead, but when I came u
         p to him he recognized me and he said: 'Do not move me for the o
         thers are
       4 about done for.' But I had to do something for him. He was my fr
         iend. He died an instant later in my arms, and then I was glad, 
         seeing his condition. This is something I will never forget as l
         ong as I live. Yes. Death is something we talk about quite openl
         y. It's there and you have to face it."
       5 That was the thing that made this boy different from what he had
          been before. He had been face to face with death. He knew he wo
         uld go back to face it again, but in the meantime he would serve
          as best he could and smile all the while. While life lasted the
         re were things to do for the living and last respects to the dea
         d. Time enough to worry about danger when it struck. Two years a
         go he had been a young, care-free boy. Today he is a man, brave,
          master of himself and his emotions. And what has wrought the ch
         ange? One thing. His ability to face reality, look it squarely i
         n the eye, and spend his strength getting the most possible joy 
         out of the real things of life, people, places, and comradeship.
       6 What are you doing, mothers of these boys who have become men ov
         ernight, who have seen more things than tongue can tell? What ar
         e you doing to change your own souls that would like to cringe a
         nd shrink into citadels strong and sure? What am I doing to prep
         are myself against the day when my sons must go forth to face th
         e pains of life and death upon their own? How do we mean to face
          the problems of our own
       7 lives courageously? We believe we could endure the dangers our s
         ons face more easily than to know that they, in whose veins flow
          our own blood, must suffer, endure, and perchance die. But if o
         ur task is great, we must be greater.
       8 I have seen mothers become whimpering old women, old long before
          their time, after their sons had sailed away to front-line acti
         on. I have seen them become helpless neurotics who can't stand t
         o hear a news broadcast, who can't bear to read a paper. If it w
         ere helping these boys, then it would have purpose. But worry, a
         nxiety cannot reach out and stop the bombs from falling. Instead
         , they twine like tentacles about the one who conceived them, cr
         ushing from her all the breath of life, like an octopus with its
          overpowering grip.
       9 Again I have seen mothers, with heads erect, lock their secret h
         eartaches into a dark corner of their beings, and valiantly go f
         orth to take their parts in the many duties of life at home. Why
          the difference? Why does one cringe and one remain indomitable.
          The reason is simple, depending upon whether you fight with lif
         e or against it, whether you look the whole thing squarely in th
         e face like the young seaman. It is whether you, too, know that 
         death is there and will admit it, or whether you are trying to a
         void it, to fight your own small futile fight, you know. Since A
         dam, men who have lived upon this earth have died. In that one t
         hing all humanity are brothers. You know that each man must die,
          but don't push the knowledge back into a far corner of your hea
         rt and refuse to face it. Well, bring it out into the
      10 light and let the sun shine upon it for awhile. You are going to
          die. Your son is going to die. No matter how you live, or griev
         e, or worry, you cannot change this fact. War doesn't make much 
         difference then. It only makes you more aware that death stalks 
         the earth.

      1 Work Meeting UTILITY APRONS IN most present-day households the ho
        memaker finds it necessary not only to do her own housework, but 
        to learn how to conserve her energy so she can accomplish all the
         tasks she desires to do. These aprons are practical in any kind 
        of household but they are invaluable in homes where there are bus
        y mothers and small children. The large pockets become convenient
         "catch-alls" for numerous articles which become misplaced. If th
        e pockets are lined with oiled silk or a plasticized material the
        y can also be used to carry a damp cloth for wiping off stray fin
        germarks, a cloth for furniture polishing, a whisk broom, etc. Su
        ch utility articles might be made on a Relief Society Work Meetin
        g in the spring or for a coming bazaar. The apron (Illus. I) is v
        ery easily made using 3/5 yd. Of material 27" wide for the apron 
        proper, and 8" of contrasting material for the pockets. The apron
         is most effective using a light color for the background and a v
        ery dark color for the pockets. The apron (Illus. 2) can be made 
        in medium size using 21/8 yds. Of 35" material. If a head bandana
         is made of the same material, a very smart effect is achieved in
         this utility costume. The apron ties and is also buttoned down t
        he back. The large pockets end a little beyond the side seams. Th
        is apron is unusually effective if a bright gay, solid color is u
        sed. Bias tape in a contrasting color makes an easy finish to use
         for binding. TIE APRON BUTTONED APRON

         MESSAGES FROM THE MISSIONS (Continued from February Magazine) Ea
        st Central States Mission THE following reports from four of the 
        branches of this mission were received during 1944. Their Mission
         Relief Society President, Leone W. Doxey, submitted all but one.
         "In the country district of Gretna, Virginia," wrote Sister Doxe
        y, "we have a Relief Society with sixteen members, thirteen of wh
        om are not members of the Church. "The meetings of tlie Gretna Re
        lief Society are held Tuesday afternoons in the home of Sister Ma
        ria Rowland, 'Granny,' as she is lovingly called by all who know 
        her. The home is a fine old Virginia farmhouse that had been the 
        home of her husband's father and mother. Granny moved into it as 
        a bride. She is now nearly eighty years old and has been a member
         of the Church for more than forty years. She teaches the theolog
        y lessons in Relief Society and is an inspiration to everyone the
        re." Mrs. L. H. Snow, president of the Chadottesville (Virginia) 
        Relief Society, wrote July 20, 1944: "In and around this city and
         also other big towns, we see many beautiful little country churc
        hes closed for lack of preachers. Women from Page 184 some of the
        se churches are joining the Relief Society and are glad to get so
        mething to do. I wish you could see our women working, making rug
        s, quilts, et cetera. The people in the country want to piece qui
        lts so Iam taking them the material. I am also taking them sample
        s of a miniature redchecked apron and a tiny pair of blue and whi
        te striped overalls, to help in the collection of contributions t
        o the building fund. A note in the apron pocket has space for fil
        ling in the woman's name and her waist measurement, and carries t
        he suggestion, "A penny for every inch." A similar note in the ov
        erall pocket suggests that the men pledge either work on the chap
        el or a cash donation. We also have one member in Hampton, and sh
        e is making something for the bazaar in October. Some members up 
        in the Blue Ridge near Standardsville are making quilts?one woman
         gave the top, filling, and bottom for a quilt last night. This p
        roject is getting every one doing something, and in that way they
         learn what we stand for and what we are doing in trying to teach
         the gospel. The people are hungry for the gospel and for friends
        ." Sister Doxey reports an unusual Relief Society meeting held at
         Fairmont, Virginia, which came to her attention through Sister C
        rozier Kimball, a short-term missionary. NOTES FROM THE FIELD 185
         RELIEF SOCIETY OF HARKERS ISLAND (NORTH CAROLINA), EAST CENTRAL 
        STATES MISSION Picture submitted March 1944 by M. LA. President R
        aymond Guthrie who stated: This Society was organized in 1923 und
        er adverse circumstances and almost unbearable persecution. Altho
        ugh at that time the membership was very small it has since grown
        , through the faith and charity exercised by the sisters, to the 
        present membership of 30. Left to right, front row: Virgie Lewis,

        thrie; third row: Glennie Guthrie, Mattie Whitley, Bessie Hancock
        , Nannie Willis and Hattie Rose. "Sister May Sloter, Relief Socie
        ty president in Fairmont, had announced on Sunday that the work m
        eeting would be held the following Wednesday afternoon. The time 
        arrived for the appointed meeting and no one came but the preside
        nt. She felt discouraged and somewhat upset, but she had said the
        re would be Relief Society meeting so she conducted one. She anno
        unced the song and sang it, opened the meeting with prayer, sang 
        again and then sat down and quilted for an hour. At the end of th
        e hour she sang another song and dismissed the meeting with praye
        r. She put her work away and returned to her home with joy and sa
        tisfaction in her heart. Sister Sloter is loved and respected by 
        the members of the Fairmont Branch and though the membership is s
        mall, after this example of faithfulness, all who possibly can no
        w attend the meetings." Northern California Mission MARY SMITH EL
        LSWORTH, recently released president of Relief Societies of the N
        orthern California Mission, wrote last June: "During the year thu
        s far I have visited in every district with President Ellsworth. 
        The most outstanding thing I find is the increased spirit of unit
        y and cooperation and love among all our sisters. Our Relief Soci
        ety meetings are held in most branches immediately following Sund

        our outlying districts and where many of our people are engaged i
        n war work. "It is the earnest desire of President Ellsworth to e
        stablish a suitable place of meeting for every branch in this mis
        sion, and in this the sisters are doing their full part. This yea
        r two chapels have been dedicated and property has been purchased
         in eight branches. The sisters have given dinners not only for t
        heir own members, but, in several instances, have served for vari
        ous clubs and groups who have paid them well. They have held rumm
        age sales to dispose of clothes collected from neighbors and frie
        nds as well as our own members. Prior to the sales, these article
        s are washed or cleaned and mended; they bring in a very good pri
        ce and help those who need them. High-type character balls and pa
        rties which included wholesome and amusing games have placed the 
        sisters in touch with many, thus affording opportunity to teach t
        he gospel by example as well as precept. "We have in the mission,
         now, 260 local missionaries, many of them our Relief Society sis
        ters. We feel thankful for this, for our younger mothers are gain
        ing experience and knowledge that will qualify them to teach thei
        r children the gospel. We appreciate the excellent lessons given 
        us by the General Board. They breathe the pure spirit of the gosp
        el, impel us to action, and help to qualify us for real missionar

        ES MISSION Mission Relief Society President Effie Meeks says this
         is a splendid singing group which is a factor in maintaining int
        erest in Relief Society work there. "In the shadow of snow-capped
         Mt. Shasta lies a minute branch of the Church?the Toyon Branch. 
        It is situated on the hills and bluffs overlooking the Sacramento
         River and Shasta Dam, the world's second largest concrete struct
        ure. "The construction of this dam has brought people from all ov
        er the world, both as workers and visitors, and so the Toyon Bran
        ch is very cosmopolitan with representation from Canada, Australi
        a, Germany, England, Sweden, Holland, as well as most of the stat
        es, from coast to coast. "The dam is fifteen miles from the neare
        st California town of any size, and its construction brought five
         or six thousand persons, some of them Mormons, into a wilderness
         of red clay, turpentine pines, manzanita, and poison oak. "Some 
        of those who came early in the construction period spent that fir
        st miserable winter (three months of constant rain) in canvas ten
        ts; but spring comes early in this part of California and by Apri
        l 1938, homes were started. Poison oak brush was plentiful and ha
        d to be cleared; even smoke from its burning carried contaminatio
        n. Most of the work of clearing was done by women and children, f
        or the work shifts on the dam changed every two weeks for some, w
        hile others worked a constant shift of day, swing or graveyard. "
        The homes usually had their beginning as one-room affairs, but as
         the men earned steadily, the homes grew. Wells were dug in very 
        unpromising terrain, with accidents, and even casualties, a commo
        n occurrence. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?MARCH 1945 MEMBERS OF THE N

        g and hard to build these homes even though they knew they were t
        o live there but a few years. Some of the women were sickly, some
         were old, some were having children, but they all had the desire
         for a home of their own. One family took the red clay, formed it
         into bricks, and, in one year, built for themselves a spacious s
        ix-room home that is now one of the social centers of the branch.
         "Gardens were made in the red clay by the women and children who
         carried fertilizer and sand from the river banks. Much to everyo
        ne's amazement, the gardens produced. The daughters of the pionee
        rs are still helping to make a garden spot in the West, and are s
        eeing that their children are raised in the culture of home and C
        hurch. "The Toyon Branch covers ten square miles. All of the visi
        ting teachers are women who have families of small children, but 
        their work has been done efficiently and on time. The loid annive
        rsary of the organization of the Relief Society was observed Marc
        h 17 by the Toyon Branch? Crystal candles, wild ferns, redbud and
         forsythia decorated the community house and an unforgettable pro
        gram was presented. The war and the closing scenes at Shasta Dam 
        are now sending this group on again to new fields, to new homes.

        ew England, this time in the 'Pilgrim Town,' Plymouth, Massachuse
        tts, where America's forefathers settled three hundred and twenty
        -four years ago. "On May 23, 1944, a Relief Society was organized
         there?the first organization of the Church of Jesus Christ of La
        tter-day Saints to be established in Plymouth. Under the directio
        n of President William H. Reeder, Jr., Bertha S. Reeder, mission 
        Relief Society president, and Elder Ted L. Miller, district presi
        dent, this Society was organized with six members. NOTES FROM THE

        r. 'These good sisters are enthusiastically meeting together each
         week, and the future of their group is promising indeed. Each ha
        s had to face the usual criticism which attends one who is willin
        g to subscribe to 'Mormon' beliefs, and the Church can be justly 
        proud of them for their Pilgrim spirit of loyalty to their convic
        tions and for their service which makes possible this Latter-day 
        Saint organization in New England's oldest town." Lola Humphreys,
         writing in the fall of 1944 as auxiliary supervisor, reported th
        e successful Relief Society convention held September 2', at Camb
        ridge, Massachusetts (the mission headquarters) for Relief Societ
        y officers. She continues: 'The careful planning which took place
         several weeks in advance, contributed greatly to the success of 
        the conference which was very well attended by approximately 75 R
        elief Society officers. "During the forenoon session, a detailed 
        and instructive outline of the duties of the officers was given b
        y Mission Relief Society President Bertha S. Reeder. The remainin
        g time was spent in the bearing of testimonies. At noon, a delici
        ous buffet luncheon was served in one of the rooms of the Cambrid
        ge chapel from a table very attractively arranged with candles an
        d flowers. In the afternoon, several talks were given in the home
        s of different Relief Society branches, and the Singing Mothers o
        f Hartford, Connecticut, offered three beautiful numbers, at inte
        rvals.
      2 "The enthusiasm and zeal with which Sister Reeder discussed the p
        roblems and with which she delivered her remarks were transferred
         to every one present. In spite of the fact that some of the memb
        ers had had travel much more capable of carrying home the day bef
        ore, they all felt much more capable of carrying on their duties 
        after the convention."
      3 A comprehensive mimeographed bulletin was distributed, carrying a
         concise and explicit digest of duties of officers and of new ins
        tructions, and also a narrative history of the several local Reli
        ef Societies in the mission for 1943-44, indicating the problems,
         activities, and accomplishments of each.
      4 Hawaiian Mission
      5 OLIVIA S. Waddoups, former Relief Society president of this missi
        on, wrote in March 1944: "Brother Waddoups is superintendent of t
        he Leper-asylum here at Kalaupapa. We find a wide field for servi
        ce to these people who, though entirely confined for life within 
        this area of about 12 square miles, are very happy, cheerful, and
         contented. They are also very war conscious, buying bonds and st
        amps to the extent of three times their quota. They are well take
        n care of by the Territory. We have a very modern hospital, two c
        apable doctors whose wives are nurses in the hospital, five other
         nurses; 12 Catholic Sisters who manage the hospital, five other 
        nuns; two Catholic priests; one Congregational minister, his wife
         and three members of his family; the plantation manager and plan
        ter; and the general manager for the United States Public Health 
        Service; the Bishop of the Roman Catholic Church; four Brothers w
        ho are in charge of the Leper Home for Men; the Catholic, with Re
        verend Alice, a real Hawaiian lady, to look after her congregatio
        n; and our L.D.S. Church. The Elders visit us monthly, and we hav
        e a patient here who is the Presiding Elder. We have the smallest
         congregation but our members are very active and interested.
      6 "The Relief Society sisters who are well enough to get out are ve
        ry active. Last Sunday we held an anniversary meeting commemorati
        ng March 17. We all came dressed in white; there were 9 of us, an
        d 12 young girls and 16 of the Priesthood. I am sure this was the
         most unique anniversary meeting in the Church. All but two of us
         are victims of the disease?myself and Sister Kalahau, a very lit
        tle one, but we try to keep who is blind but who leads the group 
        in their singing. In the group that furnished the singing there w
        ere four blind, two on crutches, and others who needed help to ge
        t around. But they sang beautifully, and bore testimony that the 
        Lord was good, and kind, and that they were very grateful for the
         Relief Society organization.

      1 The Shape of Peace Eva Willes Wangsgaard I God of all men and nat
        ions, Light in Light, I, who am spent with fear and sorrowing, As
        k for a ray to follow through this night Darkened by earthen gods
         to which men cling. There have been other years when I have seen
         Your star go down like ice from winter's bough, But never has my
         heart been caught between, And never was it torn as it is now. S
        o soon we shall be called upon to stem The tides of war and plan 
        for peace to be! That words once lifted over Bethlehem Take defin
        ite shape and purpose, we agree; But when the board of diplomats 
        convenes, What shall our blueprint be? And what our means? II The
         concept of a structure strong enough To hold all men in concord 
        that will last. To bind great powers, long inured to bluff. Into 
        a kindred whole, is a plan so vast As to exceed the limits of the
         brain. This is a vision only dreamers see, A pact no sage has ev
        er hoped to gain In any form of practicality. We have no preceden
        t on which to build. It well may be that such a scheme may fail-S
        o great the distance from the grandeur willed To grandeur sculptu
        red to a working scale! Yet build we must?another holocaust As ma
        d as this, and man himself is lost. Page 191 III We know you taug
        ht us that the structure stands Imbedded in the individual heart,
         That other temples are but built on sands, The prey of time and 
        wind they fall apart; But words wear thin; their meanings sleep u
        nknown. Unless the heart is willing to concede The world's shortc
        omings are also its own, No superstructure can fulfill our need. 
        We lack your love immeasurable within; We need your faith in one 
        eternal will For all mankind, before we can begin To plan that te
        mpests lie forever still. Bless those who plan for us. Let them b
        e wise. To shape world peace with brave, world-visioned eyes.

  JSON manifest: Vol32/Vol32_extract_results.json (189KB, valid JSON)

  Byte accounting: 167,996 bytes across extracts vs 168,035 in source. The
  39-byte gap is from newlines/whitespace at line boundaries between articles in
   the source that fall between extract boundaries. The content of every
  article, poem, story, and notice is accounted for.

  Note on #34: The Hawaiian Mission report was split across pages in the
  original magazine with "The Shape of Peace" poem inserted between. I kept the
  continuation as a separate file (#34) since it's an artifact of the magazine's
   page layout. In the JSON, both #32 and #34 are typed as notes under Pohlman.
