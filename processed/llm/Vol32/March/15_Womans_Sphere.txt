Woman's Sphere Ramona W. Cannon FOR the first time in the history of Utah, or of any other state in our country so far as can be learned, a woman has been selected as legislative chaplain in the person of Dr. Maud May Babcock who occupies that position in the Utah State Senate. Years ago, President Brigham Young's daughter, Susa, attended a class in voice building at Harvard University, taught by Miss Babcock. The pupil did not rest until Miss Babcock was in the employ of the University of Utah, where she built up one of the best known speech departments in the country, serving for fifty-two years, longer than any other faculty member. She became a convert to the Church, was the first president of the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association in the Eighteenth Ward, and introduced the study of literature into the Mutual program.
