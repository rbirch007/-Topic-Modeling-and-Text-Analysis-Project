Work Meeting UTILITY APRONS IN most present-day households the homemaker finds it necessary not only to do her own housework, but to learn how to conserve her energy so she can accomplish all the tasks she desires to do. These aprons are practical in any kind of household but they are invaluable in homes where there are busy mothers and small children. The large pockets become convenient "catch-alls" for numerous articles which become misplaced. If the pockets are lined with oiled silk or a plasticized material they can also be used to carry a damp cloth for wiping off stray fingermarks, a cloth for furniture polishing, a whisk broom, etc. Such utility articles might be made on a Relief Society Work Meeting in the spring or for a coming bazaar. The apron (Illus. I) is very easily made using 3/5 yd. Of material 27" wide for the apron proper, and 8" of contrasting material for the pockets. The apron is most effective using a light color for the background and a very dark color for the pockets. The apron (Illus. 2) can be made in medium size using 21/8 yds. Of 35" material. If a head bandana is made of the same material, a very smart effect is achieved in this utility costume. The apron ties and is also buttoned down the back. The large pockets end a little beyond the side seams. This apron is unusually effective if a bright gay, solid color is used. Bias tape in a contrasting color makes an easy finish to use for binding.
