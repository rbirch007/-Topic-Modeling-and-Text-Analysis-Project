Are We Getting Ready for 1947 One-Hundredth Anniversary Program? The Honorable Herbert B. Maw Governor of the State of Utah Prepared by Governor Maw at the request of the Church Beautification Committee. THE State of Utah is definitely and officially in favor of a state-sponsored celebration of the hundredth anniversary of the arrival in Salt Lake Valley of the Utah pioneers. The Utah Statutes provide that "the exposition provided in connection with the centennial observance shall be officially opened on May 1, 1947, and continue to October 15, 1947." This law was passed in 1939. It followed the recommendations of a committee authorized by a joint resolution adopted by the Legislature in 1937. The Act states that its purpose is "to commemorate the advent of the pioneers into Salt Lake Valley, to portray fittingly the natural resources and scenic wonders of Utah, the prehistoric culture of the west, the development of irrigation, farming, mining, forestry, transportation, culture and the arts." The law authorizes a Centennial Commission of fifteen members, selected "without regard to political or other affiliations" who serve without compensation, to be confirmed by the State Senate and to hold office as members of a body corporate for ten years, thus continuing until the completion of the celebration and exposition, and the winding up of its affairs. The members include President David O. McKay, of Salt Lake City, as chairman; Former Governor Charles R. Mabey, J. F. Fitzpatrick, S. O. Bennion, David H. Thomas, John M. Wallace, D. M. Draper, Gus P. Backman, Donald P. Lloyd, and Postmaster L A. Smoot, all of Salt Lake City; Mrs. Rosella F. Larkin and J. A. Howell, of Ogden; F. P. Champ, of Logan; A. O. Ellett, at that time a Provo resident; and Senator Ward C. Holbrook, of Bountiful. The late Nephi L. Morris, of Salt Lake City, was a member of the Commission at the time of his death. The Commission was instructed by the Act creating it to "plan and arrange for a fitting centennial observance in the year 1947, with appropriate provision being made therefor in such communities and at such scenic, historical, cultural and recreational centers of attraction from Yellowstone Park on the north to Boulder Dam on the south and from the Salt Flats on the west to the Dinosaur Quarries on the east, as the Commission may designate, and to hold and maintain an exposition on some appropriate site to be selected by it." Page 135 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE MARCH 1945 The Centennial Commission has wide authority to proceed as its considered judgment may direct. In retrospect, this project for a new kind of World's Fair one in which the main attractions were to be some of the world's greatest wonders and some of its most attractive scenery "in place" must appear a bold one, and worthy of the sturdy independence of the pioneers who came to this desert region a century ago and here developed a new form of western culture based on irrigation, the range, and the mine. Such plans were all the more remarkable because, at the time they were forming, this State and the world at large were steeped in the most severe and most widely spread economic depression in history. Many citizens were pinching their last few pennies. Schools and other public institutions were getting along on pittances far below their needs. At such a time, it required both courage and leadership on the part of men of vision to rally support for an undertaking which would require large expenditures, one from which the returns, though perhaps certain, would be largely intangible. Then war intervened. A far-seeing National Government inaugurated an emergency defense program in 1939 and 1940. After December 7, 1941, this country was plunged into the most destructive struggle in all history. Wartime needs would not be denied. Men and women were summoned to battle. Vast projects were initiated. Labor shortages became acute. Rigid priorities were established. Today, Utah boys and girls are fighting and dying on the battle-fronts of the world to preserve that way of life for which their pioneer ancestors gave their all. We cannot and we must not let them down. Is all, then, lost? Has everything been sacrificed on Mars' bloody altar? Must we entirely forego the duty we owe to the founders of this commonwealth, to honor their courage and their self-sacrifice, to pay fitting tribute to their daring and resourcefulness? Is there no way in which we can renew the ideals for which they lived and died? Those ideals have made this State and the Intermountain Region great. They have stirred the hearts of men to battle for freedom and to love their fellow man. The men and women Utah desires to honor were not in the habit of giving up their plans because difficulties confronted. Their sons and daughters and those who followed the pioneers into this land will profit by their example, will display the same independence and leadership. Utahns will not permit the murk of war to blot out the centennial of the State's founding. Wartime conditions may restrict the extent of the celebration. They cannot obliterate the memory of the Utah pioneers, nor can they quench the ardor and enthusiasm of the celebrants. WHAT sort of celebration shall be attempted if the war with Germany and Japan is still being desperately waged in 1947? Are we prepared with an adequate program if world peace has come by that time? Or if either of the remaining Axis foes is still on his feet? The answer to these queries becomes fairly obvious. Such observance of the centennial is always possible Torius Knaphus THE HANDCART as will not require great expenditures of manpower suitable for military service or war industry work. In the meantime, plans must be formulated blueprints drawn, if you like ready to be put into action the minute manpower and materials become available should hostilities cease or slacken. It would seem basic, for example, that, in order to celebrate properly, the State must take on a holiday attire. This is something in which each resident can join. There is nothing in war's demands that requires broken down fences, filthy corrals, dilapidated outbuildings or unpainted homes. Rather do neatness and order go hand-in-hand with efficient, productive labor, and that is one of the essentials of the war effort. Let Utah, then, dress up in honor of her pioneer founders. That much groundwork for an adequate celebration certainly is possible. Other forms of observance which require little or no extra drain on the State's manpower can be encouraged. An art exhibition, an Easter pageant, a State or County Fair, any activity which has become a customary and periodic outlet for community effort can tell the story of a century during which civilization and the modern way of life were established on the unpromising and hostile desert. Let the management and sponsors of all such community events redouble their efforts to make the 1947 version far excel all its predecessors. It will prove an eloquent tribute to the greatness of the enterprise the Utah pioneers instituted. These are but suggestions for a beginning of the groundwork of the centennial program. Other and more definite features will be worked out as circumstances permit. The main idea is that this great historic occasion can and must be fittingly commemorated. The spirit of the pioneers of western irrigation is not dead. That same indomitable courage and ingenuity which enabled them to direct the harsh natural forces to man s benefit will encourage us their sons and daughters, to pay adequate tribute to our forefathers  accomplishments.
