PRAYING HANDS Clarence Edwin Flynn On broad, green fields are many hands that labor, Turning to sun and rain the fresh, sweet soil. Wielders of hammer, pen, and loom, and saber. Alike must live upon their daily toil. Under the summer sun they do their duty, Loosing the ground that roots and stalks may grow, Coaxing to richness and productive beauty The waving ear and tassel, row on row. Comes a bright day when autumn's sun is slanting Its mellow rays across the golden grain. They gather then the harvest of their planting. Grateful that they have labored not in vain. All these are praying hands. An old petition Their labor makes?one that has long been said By those of every country and condition: "Give us, we ask, this day, our daily bread."
