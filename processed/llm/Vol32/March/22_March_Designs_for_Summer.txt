March Designs For Summer Hazel D. Moyle OF all the year's calendar, March is the least loved month. . . . And passing few are they who speak, wild, stormy month, in praise of thee." . . . Yet March has an important place in the year's garden work.
It is true that we can do but little out of doors at this early season?a fact which we soon discover when we venture out into our wet and sodden flower beds. But we can find solace, at this time of year, for that first hunger for green growing things which springs up so violently in the breast of every garden lover. We can not only elect our winter-weary selves, but we can assure our gardens an early and abundant bloom next summer by starting seeds indoors in early March.
Certain vegetables can also be started indoors with profit; that intriguing new tomato, "Change Jubilee" must be grown from your own sowing of seeds if you are to enjoy its piquant flavor and unusual appearance come next August, for few nurserymen offer ready-grown plants of this new variety.
One can, it is true, now purchase most kinds of annuals all readygrown for planting out when May arrives, but such ready-made plants under the present war conditions command a fairly high price. If your planting spaces are large, it will certainly pay you to try to raise your own plants. One can, if she is successful, reap an entire garden-full of plants by means of a few packages of seeds plus a little honest effort.
And there is the added advantage of being able to select just those colors, varieties, and kinds that suit one's own personal tastes.
It is especially profitable to make early March sowings of such annuals as the following: petunia, the most brilliant blooming of all (plant the low bedding varieties for garden decoration, and the giant ruffled kinds for cutting); lobelia, that tiny low-edging plant of such blazing, glowing blue color; snapdragon, rivaling petunias for constant all-year bloom, plus variety in coloring (we plant many shades of pink, flame, yellow, and crimson); verbena, these soon completely cover any wide space with a gorgeous, low carpet of fragrant color; stock . . . Ah me! the lovely, clean perfume of blossoming stocks; and ageratum, flower of soft blue, an exquisite peacemaker among our flower beds (plant this near the front line). All of these need an early start indoors if you are to have them blossoming from late June and on until snow flies.
THE requirements for indoor seed planting are few. Foremost is a suitable room in which to keep the seed boxes. The ordinary, well heated living room is too hot and dry for really good results. Choose, if you can, a cooler room, one that is light and airy, and where you can have plenty of ventilation. It should have at least one good sunny window. You might make use of your kitchen to keep the boxes when the seeds are germinating, for they can be kept in any warm room under a table out of the way at this stage, but the moment the tiny things begin to push up the soil, they must have light and air. An unheated, sunny room would be ideal after they are up.
Use a wooden box four inches deep and from twelve to eighteen inches long; too much depth of soil is not conducive to healthy growth, yet it should be deep enough to accommodate the young roots.
The soil used is of the greatest of importance; you should mix this as carefully as you would your Christmas pudding. A sandy soil is best, and some experts use one-third pure sand, one-third good clean dirt, and the last third, real black leaf mold or housewives' garden compost. You may be able to purchase a small sack of soil all mixed and ready to use from some florist or nurseryman, should you not have the above ingredients, and this might be the means of your real success in the venture.
A layer of broken flower pots, small pebbles, and coarse peat moss should be placed in the bottom of the seed box, then the prepared and sifted soil is placed over this rough drainage to fill the box to within one-half inch of the top. Press the whole down firmly with some board or even a paper magazine to insure no air pockets, especially at corners and edges. Then you are ready for the sowing of seeds.
And here is where we make our greatest mistake, for most amateur gardeners sow the seeds too thickly. Each seed should be sown separately, even the tiny ones such as the petunia. Prepare the box by scattering a
pinch slowly and carefully, then sift a little fine soil over them and press the surface lightly with a spoon. Larger seeds can be planted in rows, covering them with soil three times their own diameter. Do not sow too many, a package of seeds will raise several hundred plants; judge your needs accordingly, and strive for a few well-grown plants rather than too many that are crowded and puny.
Water by placing the seed box in a large pan or tub containing an inch or two of lukewarm water. Let it stand until the moisture has soaked up into the soil and shows on the surface, then remove the box and drain off for a few moments. Cover with a pane of glass to prevent evaporation, and to maintain even moisture and temperature. On top of the glass place a newspaper to exclude light as germination is best in dark. Place the box in any warm corner to germinate.
You should restrain yourself from peeking into the box for a few days, for most of the varieties named above require from ten days to two weeks to germinate. Nevertheless, keep your eye on them, for the soil should be kept moist but not wet, and just as soon as you see the little hummocks pushing up the surface, the paper should be removed to give them light. And as soon as they begin to show green (and no matter how often you have seen this miracle happen, it is always thrilling) the glass should be removed.
You must assist your young charges to grow up straight and sturdy by turning the box often as the plants lean towards the light. As soon as two pairs of leaves have developed, they should be transplanted into other boxes of soil to stand two inches apart. They will now need a richer soil. Prepare additional boxes as before except that another part of old, well-rotted manure is added to the soil mixture, and one can also include chemical fertilizer now with excellent results. Purchase any good brand available, and follow directions given on package for its use.
As the plants grow they will need more fresh air. One can now shift them outside to a cold frame or any improvised shelter made from an old wooden box if you have a glass cover to fit over the top. An old window frame will serve to protect the glass, or with a rug or old blanket to cover them during cold snaps or nights. As the days grow warmer, the glass covering must be lifted. Strive to harden your plants to the outdoor world, do not fail to cover or protect them if the weather changes. They can be planted out in the garden as soon as all danger of frost is over, usually in May first.
In the meantime, the outdoor garden work has begun. Digging and preparation of soil for planting should be started as soon as the ground has dried out sufficiently to permit digging. Use that old method of testing the ground by taking up a handful of soil and squeezing it to a ball; if it will then crumble and fall apart easily, the soil is ready for digging, but if it remains a wet ball, wait a few days longer for it to
dry. Real damage is done to garden soil by working it while yet, it does not recover its loose, springy mellowness if dug too soon; and roots find it hard to penetrate.
Trees, shrubs, and especially roses and lilacs should be planted the moment the ground is dry enough to work . . . do not delay a moment if you want them to have a good early start and to prosper well. They can establish early root growth during the cool, early spring before the sun has gained power.
Clean-up time also arrives during March, but be careful in removing any coverings. Loosen and take away coverings gradually. The rose bushes, too, will need their yearly pruning during late March or early April . . . just as soon as killing frosts are over, but not too soon. We must all learn to judge when this time arrives.
Be warned and leave climbing roses strictly alone at this season (so many amateurs want to trim them in early spring). Wait until the leaves unfold, and then remove only the wood that is actually dead.
So we see that March, though she has won such a poor reputation for herself, can be made to yield much in beauty for later months if the home gardener will but use her to good advantage.
March with grief doth howl and rave, And April weeps?but O ye hours! Follow with May's fairest flowers ?Dirge of the Year"?Shelley
