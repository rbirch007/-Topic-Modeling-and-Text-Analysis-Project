MARCH MOODS Jeanette P. Parry March with a snowy overcoat. And ice about his chin. Is blowing up another storm Before springtime comes in. The pussywillow, wise and gay, Has donned a warm, fur coat; She smiles at teas and fashion shows Where subtle perfumes float. The snowdrop, foolish child of Spring, Stands barefoot in the storm; She thinks her filmy, short, white dress Will serve to keep her warm.
