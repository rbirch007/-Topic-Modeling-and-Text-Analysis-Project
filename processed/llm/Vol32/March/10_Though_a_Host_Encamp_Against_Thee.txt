Third Prize Story Annual Relief Society Short Story (contest Though A Host Encamp Against Thee Dorothy Clapp Rohinson JULIA scraped the coals closer under her bakeoven. Even if she was nearly eleven, bread-making took the starch right out of her. The wood Isaac brought didn't make good coals. She was going to tell Pa well, maybe not now. Lately Pa didn't seem to love them any more than Heavenly Father did. It wasn't as if they didn't know, 'cause they did. All year the saints had talked and prayed about it, and if that wasn't enough there were her own secret prayers. No, Heavenly Father didn't have the excuse of not knowing; but Pa might not know about the chopping. At noon she had tried to tell him. "I am not leaving." He had scowled at her. "Nothing short of the United States Army will move me." Julia didn't know about the United States Army. All she knew was Johnson Army. Everybody was moving south to get away from him. Everybody, but them. Julia wasn't hankering for a move. She'd had too many of them. This place in the canyon was the only real home she could remember. But burning it and moving south would be better than the chopping. DOROTHY CLAPP ROBINSON "Brother Williams says he is following the Move so his family will be safe." For a moment Pa hadn't spoken. When he did, his voice was the way it sometimes got when they talked about Ma. "Maybe I should have taken you to your grandma; but Grantsville is a long way." He looked about the Page 143 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE MARCH 1945 room. "I snaked these logs out of the canyon. Your Ma helped me raise them. I will put my trust in the Lord and stay here." When Pa used that tone of voice there was no use going on. Trusting was all right for him. He was an old man, nearly thirty-six, and old men are not afraid. Dorcas Williams had whispered to her about the chopping. She said when Old Johnson Army got to the Valley, if he found any young'uns there, he would cut off their ears, and maybe chop off both hands and both feet. Like Squaw Bill. She'd done something and the bucks of her tribe had chopped off her hands. Now she lived with the Williamses. After banking the fire Julia went outside. At the woodpile she found a long, thick sliver. She would use it to try the bread. Sister Williams had put her on to that. No sense trusting to looks. The first time she had baked after Ma died, she had her lesson. Because the bread was brown she'd thought it was done. Spreading one of Ma's snowy dish-wipers on the hearth, she had lifted the oven to turn out the bread. Instead of coming out in loaves, the crust had broken; and dough had run all over the dishwiper. She'd scooped it back in a hurry with her bare hands, so none of it would be wasted. That had been a mess with burned hands and only slow-poke Sally to help. As Julia started toward the house with her sliver, she saw a curl of smoke far down the Valley then another. The burning had started! That meant Old Johnson Army was close. She sat down on a stump and tears trickled down her thin cheeks. Oh, Ma, why couldn't you have stayed. Pa would listen to you. President Young when he was up to see Pa said, "You're a brave girl, and don't worry, Ma is happy." Huh. Heaven must be something; or Ma had changed in a hurry. She knew Hi was only ten months old and that Sally was slow as molasses in a snowdrift. Well, maybe Old Johnson Army would kill all of them. It would be a relief, at that, to turn Sally and Isaac over to Ma. FOR supper they had bread'n'milk and Injun-meal mush. Pa got a slice of the new bread. He worked hard, and if he liked it, he might listen about the chopping. He liked it. He even said Julia would soon be as good a breadmaker as her mother; but when she tried to talk "Move" he laid down his spoon and looked at her. "I am not being chased out of my home again. Besides, when you put your trust in the Lord you leave it up to him." "We'll be alone. Everybody is go- "Some won't go. You wouldn't want to go without me, would you?" "No-o." She blinked back the tears that stung her eyeballs. The young'uns had all stopped eating to listen. "No, but there is Tommy and Baby ." Pa broke a crust of his new bread and gave it to Baby Hi, who was in the highchair by him. He put an extry spoonful of molasses on Tommy's mush. The quiet was something turrible, and Pa's hand shook sb some of the molasses spilled. At last he looked straight at Julia. He really was an old man. "I have thought about it, and THOUGH A HOST ENCAMP AGAINST THEE 145 prayed about it, and listened to counsel. I am going to stay." Just then Isaac tipped over his milk. Julia boxed his ears, but by the time she'd cleaned it up Pa was gone, saying he was going to work late at the gristmill. He took John with him. John was two years older than Julia, and worked with Pa now. Later, Julia lay staring into the darkness. She was in Pa's bed in the front room so she could watch Tommy and Baby. There was no use closing her eyes when Old Johnson Army stayed right in front of them. She raised on her elbow. By the light of the moon shining through the open doorway she could see the little ones. Baby Hi had one chubby fist under his cheek. Tommy was on his back with arms and legs outstretched. Just imagine that old sooner hurting them! She didn't care if Pa got clean out of patience with her; she was not going to see them hurt. If neither Pa nor Heavenly Father was going to do anything, she would have to. SLOWLY an idea came to her. It grew and grew. She would get Bally from the pasture. He was gentle and would carry five. She would bundle some didies and food, and they would leave before Pa got back. With them gone, Pa and John could hide. It was terrible to go again your own father, but she had a duty to the young uns. Slipping out of bed, she dressed hurriedly. As she stood a moment in the doorway, a lump swelled in her throat. Something just like one of Ma's arms held her tight to the place. The moon was high. The mountains had moved close and the run-along song of the crick was enough to wake the dead. Warm chills ran up her back. After the heat and dust of the plains it was like well, like having Ma after not having her. Leaving the yard, she walked toward the pasture where they kept Bally. The gristmill stood out like a ghost. It was made of logs, like the house. Until lately, both had seemed so safe and strong. Especially after the plains. She couldn't remember Nauvoo much, and about all she could remember of Winter Quarters was tents and wagons. She could remember how cold the Platte River was for she had fallen into it. She could remember an Injun trying to buy her, and she could remember Jim Bridger's squaws. Leastways she could remember their bright blankets. But her best remembering was of heat and dust, and how tired her legs got gathering buffalo chips. She had never rightly understood about the moving. Everyone said, have faith, the Lord will give us a home, but that hadn't stopped the wagons. Until they reached the Valley, it hadn't. No one had kept up with the moving more willingly than the Phippens. She didn't blame Pa for not wanting to start that again. Still-. Bally wasn't in the pasture. Just her luck to have Pa using him. She'd sneak up. If the mill was running, she might get him away without being heard. There was no light in the mill. The big door was open but there was no sign of Pa or John. The inside dark was so quiet she could hear a rat gnawing. What if they had skipped? For shame, Julia RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE MARCH 1945 Phippen. Pa'd never do that in Kingdom Come. You thought that 'cause you are doing it to him. But she was taking the young'uns to safety. A sound from the hillside made her turn. She waited breathlessly until it came again. It was Bally sneezing. Now what was he doing up there? Slipping from shadow to shadow she approached a small grove on a near slope. Within the grove was a small cave where the young'uns often played. Among the trees the light was dim, and, for a moment, she could see nothing. Then she saw them. They must have been using him, for Bally was tied to a quaker. Pa and John were piling brush and dead branches over the mouth of the cave, but helter-skelter to make it look natural. 'Think anyone will find it?" she heard John ask. "Never," Pa answered. "We can move it after the trouble is over." Julia forgot Bally. She forgot why she had come. She remembered only that here was more trouble, and different than she had dreamed of. Now she couldn't run out on Pa no matter what he had done. Back in bed she tried to smother her hard breathing. Directly she heard them come in. Baby Hi fussed a little as Pa lay down beside him, but almost at once Pa was snoring. Then Julia looked at her thoughts. They had buried something. It must be turrible or they wouldn't make a secret of it. Maybe they had killed an Injun, or maybe even Old Johnson Army. Maybe he had come sneaking around to do the chopping and they had beat him to it. Pa was in Dutch either way. If it was Johnson Army, the Gove'-ment  she didn't know what that was but everyone talked about it-would be on his trail. If it was an Injun her heart beat suffocatingly. You can't fool Injuns for long. Besides, Pa might be called before the Brethren. He might even be in danger of hell-fire. The scriptures said something about shedding innocent blood. She hoped Injun blood wasn't too innocent, but who had the say-so? Every way she looked there was a thick black wall. She just had to have help. She'd try Heavenly Father again. Ma had been strong on prayer. Slipping out of bed she knelt down and put her face against the bedding. Protect them all, especially Pa and John, and if it had to be a killing they'd done, let it be Johnson Army. Some good would come of that, but killing an Injun would be all bad. Let Pa lose his stubborn streak and light out, come daybreak. Maybe they could still catch up with the others. Suddenly, she realized she was talking more to Ma than to Heavenly Father. Likely he would overlook it, seeing she was one of his newest angels. JULIA woke, heavy with dread, but the morning was so bright she could almost believe she dreamed about the cave. If her prayer was to be answered, now was the time. Pa was stirring the mush when she entered the kitchen. She hastened to wipe off the table and set out the dishes. All the time she listened for the word from Pa, but it didn't come. Her mush stuck in her throat. Maybe Heavenly Father THOUGH A HOST ENCAMP AGAINST THEE 147 hadn't liked the way she prayed after all. She hadn't said thy will 'cause she wanted her will this time. Three times she caught Pa looking at her. He told her again what a good bake she got on the bread. He warned Isaac and Sally he'd tend to them if they didn't help more. As he was leaving, he took his gun. "Keep no bring the young'uns up to the mill when your work is done. They can play around up there." Julia made herself real busy so she wouldn't look at him. Her last hope was gone. A heavy ache inside made her feet big and her hands slow. Pa pretended to be working hard, but he stopped every little while to stand looking. Most often his eyes turned toward the canyon where lay the road into the Valley. He kept his gun close beside him. The sun hadn't found the bottom of the canyon yet when a rider came pounding up to the yard of the mill. It was Jim Ashley, and Pa came out to talk to him.  This is your last chance" Julia heard Jim say. "Tomorrow will be too late. What's a mill anyway?" "The saints will need flour wherever they are." Pa spoke real slow but every word stood out. "Mills don't grow on trees. I am staying with mine." Julia was right proud of him for a minute; but if Brother Ashley couldn't budge him, no one could. The best she could do was keep the young'uns close around. What happened to one would happen to all. About noon Lafe Cartright came by. He had been left to do the burning if it came to that. Some, he said, had got in a hurry and done the burning themselves. Pa agreed that was foolish. "Well, it will soon be over," Lafe called, as he rode away. Julia was past all feeling. If the worst, was to come, it would, only she hadn't thought God would be one-sided. She had tried to be good; as good as Dorcas, but the Williamses were safe. 'Course she couldn't put all the blame on Heavenly Father, but if he could move mountains why couldn't he change Pa's mind? As soon as Lafe was out of sight, Julia moved Baby Hi close by the mill steps. She called Tommy to come play on the blanket with him. She tried to mend, but the patch kept puckering. Finally she threw it aside. The minutes were endless. Suddenly, John let go with a loud yell from the roof of the mill where Pa had stationed him. "Here they come." Quicker than skat Pa shinned up the corner of the mill and was looking to where John pointed. Isaac and Sally climbed the big tree that hung over the crick. "I can see them," Isaac shouted, and Sally added her, "I can, too." Julia started to climb the mill, but halfway up she turned back. The mill roof was too far away. She stood on a stump near the babies. She looked where the others were looking, and, suddenly, she saw a thousand or maybe even a million points of light, like the sun hitting guns. "What is it?" she called, eager to share what the others were seeing. "The Army," Pa was breathing hard like he had been running. "Johnson's Army. Caught up with us at last." RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE MARCH 1945 "I can't see good," Sally cried. Trying to move, she slipped and fell into the water with a yell and a splash. By the time they had pulled her out and changed her clothes and rubbed arnica on her bruises, the Army was gone. Pa went back up and locked the mill, and then he helped lay out an early supper. He even got a jar of Ma's sarvis-berry jelly. Three times in the night, Julia heard him walking around. LATE evening of the next day, Jim Ashley came back. Pa hadn't been at the mill all day, and it seemed he couldn't wait for Jim to get there. He went a piece to meet him. When he came back he sat down on the doorstep. He looked so happy Julia sat down beside him. The young'uns, except John, were in bed; and darkness filled all the hollows. "What did Jim say?" she asked finally. "It's over." Pa's voice sounded as young as John's only it didn't squeak. 'The Lord was with, us even as I doubted." Julia looked at him in surprise. "Were you afraid?" "I was scared stiff." "What's Johnson's Army, Pa, and why did the saints have to move?" "We thought we were in for trouble again. We thought the soldiers would take our homes and we were not going to let that happen again. We would burn them first. That is why men were left to set fires." The gid looked around at the mountains in the back, with the moon just peeping over the rim. She looked at the lake in the distance, and the sloping Valley between. It was wonderful to have a home that was safe and strong and a Pa that was scared but stayed anyway. She could talk to him now. Words tripped over her tongue trying to get said. She told about the chopping and how she thought Johnson Army was a cruel giant. She even owned up to her feelings against him and Heavenly Father. Pa listened without saying a word. It was bright moonlight now, and she could see slow tears run down into his whiskers. He drew her close against him. "Poor little young'un," he said, "I have been so wrapped up in my own worries I have overlooked yours. I have expected too much of you, but it seems like you are my right hand." Julia hardly breathed. She didn't want to spoil the sweetness of that moment, but she must know one thing more. "What about the Injun, Pa?" "What Injun?" his voice was puzzled. "The one you buried in the cave." Slowly Pa's eyes came alive. He started to laugh, quietly at first, then lively. She hadn't heard such fun in his voice since before Ma took sick. "The Injun we buried was flour. That is why Brother Young was up to see me. We thought we might lose the mill but we couldn't take chances on the flour." Through the soft light she could see the trust in his eyes. "We were wrong, both of us. We forgot there are many ways for prayers to be answered. His way was much better than yours or THOUGH A HOST ENCAMP AGAINST THEE 149 mine. The Army has gone on down to the Jordan. There isn't going to be any trouble." Suddenly the breadmaking, the care of the young'uns were mere trifles. Heavenly Father had remembered them. A verse Ma used to read came to her mind. "Some put their trust in chariots; and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the Lord, our God." Yes. She would always remember.
