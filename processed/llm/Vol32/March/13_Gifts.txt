GIFTS Grace A. Cooper When gods of sound and goddesses of color send Down gifts to man, their gems and blooms and music blend; Like silence, drugged, the pearl-gray fog escapes the bay, Soft murmurs from the golden glow of summer day Join whispered converse of the leaves of verd and jade; Late roses echo reds of rubies' deeper shade. When beryls raise their batons, all is statue-still, Then amethysts and violets, in cadence, trill; Turquoise and larkspur improvise a symphony, The diamond and jasmine play their melody. Between the black and darkened clouds are silver rifts  For gods and goddesses, to mankind, blend their gifts.
