VOL. 32 MARCH 1945 NO. 3 Gratitude For Church Guidance ONE hundred and three years will have passed this March seventeenth since the first auxiliary of the Church, the Relief Society, was established for the benefit of its members and for the good of others. In that year, 1842, the Church had risen triumphant through its first twelve momentous years. It had been driven from New York to Ohio, from Missouri to Illinois, and already the necessary laws and powers for the coming forth and future progress of the Church had been revealed and confirmed. It was during that all-too-brief period of calm between the lashing storms of persecution, while the Church lay, as it were, at safe anchorage on the broad blue waters of the Mississippi at Nauvoo, that a few of the Church women gave utterance to their longing to be formed into an organization so that their united efforts might more speedily and effectually accomplish tasks allotted to them. It is significant that these women did not themselves inaugurate a society, but turned to their Prophet-leader for guidance. At a time and place set by him, he organized them, and under his continued tutelage thus was instituted the Relief Society which grew in one hundred years from a membership of eighteen to over one hundred thousand. The broad basic principles which Page 158 have always governed the Society were laid by the Prophet Joseph Smith; however the planning and putting into execution of these policies have always been entrusted to the officers and members of the Society, who fully merited the confidence thus reposed in them, manifesting a devotion to duty, throughout the years, which has resulted in an immeasurable amount of labor, of loving service, and of enlightenment. Relief Society is obedient to the leadership of Church authorities today as it was one hundred years ago, and stands ready to accept and support new policies as they are deemed desirable. So guided and so conducted, the advancing years will find the Society growing ever more powerful, more potent in building testimonies of the gospel in members, more fully fulfilling its high destiny. On this one hundred and third anniversary, Relief Society members acknowledge the gratitude of their hearts for the guidance of the general and local authorities, for their zealous, watchful care to the end that the services rendered by Relief Society women are being extended in everwidening spheres to keep pace with the accelerated need for such services in the expansion and progression of the Church.
