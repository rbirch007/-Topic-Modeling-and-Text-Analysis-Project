10 A LITTLE GIRL Jo Adelaide Stock Joy fills my heart, sweet, when I see The precious promises in thee. Thou art to me the soft perfume That sleeps within a summer's bloom. Thou art a song as masters sing Of love and youth and stars and spring; Thou art the bubbling of a fount; The cap of snow upon the mount. Thou art the gentleness of rain; Thou art the sweetness after pain; O thou'rt laughter after sorrow, Promise of the new tomorrow. Thou art dawning after dark. And the carol which a lark Showers down like unto leaven, On its way to God and heaven!
