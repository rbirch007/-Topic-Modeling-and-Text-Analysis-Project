No Tongue Can Tell Marguerite J. Griffin "OUT there we talk of death quite calmly," said a young sailor, home on leave after seeing action in the South Pacific. "We talk over what has happened to this one and that one of our friends. We never spare the details. We talk of death quite as matter-of-factly, as if we were discussing a newspaper item. We might as well. It's all around us out there, and we know it. I've seen more things than I can tell you."
He was much changed, this young man, from what he had been when he had gone away. Two years older? Yes, but more than that. His ordinarily fair-skinned face was bronzed from the rigors of sea life. But there were shadows across his brow, faint ones easily removed by his ready smile, but still lurking there in moments of repose. There was a firm new purpose to his jaw, as though, whatever his naval rank, he was master of himself no matter what the days might bring. And all this change because he had seen more things than tongue can tell. Physical suffering he had seen because he served with the medical corps. Death he had seen. Men dying before his very eyes. Men dying without a whimper, without a complaint.
"After one bombing we went about on deck helping the wounded. They were lying all about. I saw a fellow who had been my best friend lying over his gun. I thought he was dead, but when I came up to him he recognized me and he said: 'Do not move me for the others are
about done for.' But I had to do something for him. He was my friend. He died an instant later in my arms, and then I was glad, seeing his condition. This is something I will never forget as long as I live. Yes. Death is something we talk about quite openly. It's there and you have to face it."
That was the thing that made this boy different from what he had been before. He had been face to face with death. He knew he would go back to face it again, but in the meantime he would serve as best he could and smile all the while. While life lasted there were things to do for the living and last respects to the dead. Time enough to worry about danger when it struck. Two years ago he had been a young, care-free boy. Today he is a man, brave, master of himself and his emotions. And what has wrought the change? One thing. His ability to face reality, look it squarely in the eye, and spend his strength getting the most possible joy out of the real things of life, people, places, and comradeship.
What are you doing, mothers of these boys who have become men overnight, who have seen more things than tongue can tell? What are you doing to change your own souls that would like to cringe and shrink into citadels strong and sure? What am I doing to prepare myself against the day when my sons must go forth to face the pains of life and death upon their own? How do we mean to face the problems of our own
lives courageously? We believe we could endure the dangers our sons face more easily than to know that they, in whose veins flow our own blood, must suffer, endure, and perchance die. But if our task is great, we must be greater.
I have seen mothers become whimpering old women, old long before their time, after their sons had sailed away to front-line action. I have seen them become helpless neurotics who can't stand to hear a news broadcast, who can't bear to read a paper. If it were helping these boys, then it would have purpose. But worry, anxiety cannot reach out and stop the bombs from falling. Instead, they twine like tentacles about the one who conceived them, crushing from her all the breath of life, like an octopus with its overpowering grip.
Again I have seen mothers, with heads erect, lock their secret heartaches into a dark corner of their beings, and valiantly go forth to take their parts in the many duties of life at home. Why the difference? Why does one cringe and one remain indomitable. The reason is simple, depending upon whether you fight with life or against it, whether you look the whole thing squarely in the face like the young seaman. It is whether you, too, know that death is there and will admit it, or whether you are trying to avoid it, to fight your own small futile fight, you know. Since Adam, men who have lived upon this earth have died. In that one thing all humanity are brothers. You know that each man must die, but don't push the knowledge back into a far corner of your heart and refuse to face it. Well, bring it out into the
light and let the sun shine upon it for awhile. You are going to die. Your son is going to die. No matter how you live, or grieve, or worry, you cannot change this fact. War doesn't make much difference then. It only makes you more aware that death stalks the earth.
BUT you say: "My boy is so young! What a pity a life is cut short in youth!" So we always feel. A pity to die so young! But what does it matter if life be long or short? The important thing is, how have we lived and how have we died. The day to an honest man, busy with his constructive work, may seem all too short. The same day to a criminal waiting to pay for his crime upon the gallows may seem a fortunate eternity. But the day had twenty-four hours, and if it rained it rained for both. The difference is only in the human heart, in the way of life. One man knows the peace of honesty, the other the remorse, the despondency of a life which must pay for wasted deeds. Who, then, can measure a life, if it be long or short? Better to say it was rich or poor. Rich in valiance, in love, in honor, or poor in fear, in selfishness, in smallness of spirit. True it is, today many a youth gives his life, brief in years, but full of valor. "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends."
"Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you." A strange thing? It has happened over and over in this world, but there has appeared with it the strange. It is something we have never felt before. It is a thrust to our courage. But we are not alone. Dogs that help? Every soul who has lived has had to face his Gethsemane, even the Son of Man. "Forasmuch as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin."
As human beings we must suffer some things over which we have no control, sickness, financial reverses, death, but at least if we seek an honorable way to life we can spare ourselves many heartaches of our own making.
There are so many things to benefit humanity that need to be done. Your sons are doing a big part of them. There is much remaining for us to do at home. There will always be a need for worthwhile tasks, well done.
"And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell." And what person is it we should fear? None other than our own selves. True we must answer the call of death, for that is an event of life through which all must pass, but how we die and how we live
that is our own affair. We can chart a course which will steer us safely through troubled waters or we can let our souls crack up in the storm. It is for us to choose.
"And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me." Hear the words of the Son of God who gave his life upon the cross to break the bonds of death, that the sea might one day give up the dead that are in it, that he might say unto the dry, parched, shattered bones of war, "Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live: and I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the Lord." The same Lord who said: "These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world."
As he leads let us follow, and while our days endure in the world we, too, can overcome the trials that beset our days, we can take up our cross and follow him. We can feel his peace which is so sweet no tongue can tell.
