The Story of a Gifted Lady Leah D. Widtsoe ALICE MERRILL HORNE HE was an unlearned, ordinary looking farmer's lad, who had spent his days at farm drudgery, for his parents were struggling to make the farm produce a scanty living for their growing family. But within him dwelt the power to see beauty in the glowing sunsets, the bright tints of autumn, and the glorious light effects on the mountains, clouds, and valleys wherever he worked. Even the good earth talked to him as he turned the brown fur-Page 150 rows for spring planting. He also possessed the gift of putting on paper or canvas or anything on which he could lay his hands, the pictures which crowded through his mind. So, instead of spending his scanty earnings on new clothes, or guns and powder, with which to kill God's innocent creatures, he bought paper, crayons, paints, and oils, and transferred the pictures of his mind to paper or canvas, until his home was crowded with the results of his leisure efforts. At first his mother encouraged him, but later began to feel that he should be spending his time on something more profitable. Then one day, through a lucky chance, he met A Fairy Godmother She took the time to visit his home, recognized his gift, and told him that he should cultivate it. When told how impossible that would be financially, she volunteered to sell his pictures, thereby helping him to raise money with which to attend a great art school in the East. Then this dainty, but indomitable, art patron went to a number of the well-to-do people in the city, told them the story of the gifted farmer's lad, and soon had sold enough of his pictures to enable him to achieve the ambition of his life. This good lady has rendered similar service for many of Utah's gifted sons and daughters. She has been, and still is, a real fairy godmother THE STORY OF A GIFTED LADY 151 to them, and through her encouragement has taken a leading role in making Utah art conscious. Wouldn't you like to know more about her? Her life story begins in the days when the pioneers were called to settle remote parts of the (then) Territory, and it bristles with tales of Indian unrest as well as the romance of state-building. It is as exciting and interesting as any which begins with the intriguing Once Upon A Time Once in a very great while, an especially gifted spirit is sent to earth to take a body and become a blessing to many people and the state, as well as to family and friends. Such a precious spirit came to the frontier log cabin home of Clarence Merrill and Bathsheba Smith, who were each descended from stalwart Utah pioneers. The father was called by Brigham Young to learn telegraphy, and then to settle first at Cove Creek Fort, that outpost of Indian activity, and later to take care of telegraph operations at Fillmore, which was then the capital of Utah Territory. There a baby daughter was born to them, and was named Alice Smith Merrill. She grew to be a lovely child, who was later to honor highly the name and the lineage she bears. Two of her great-grandparents. Patriarch John Smith and his wife Clarissa Loomis Lyman, were pioneers of 1847, and all four of her grandparents were early pioneers also. Her grandfather, George A. Smith, was both Church historian and first counselor to President Brigham Young, while her grandmother, Bathsheba W. Smith, was the fourth general president of the Relief Society. Two of her great-grandparents passed away before reaching the "Valley." Thus Alice is a true daughter of pioneers, and the fourth generation of believers in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. The girlhood of this favored child was passed in the ideal environment of a fine, two-story brick home (evolved from the log cabin) located in a quarter block of garden and orchard, in company with a large family of brothers and sisters to help make life a round of merriment as well as of struggle. There were vegetables and fruits to be gathered in summer, wild strawberries and native black currants, choke cherries, and service berries to be brought from the canyons; fruit to be canned and dried in autumn; with quilt blocks to make and rags to be sewed for carpets during the long winter hours when school was out. These chores were varied with pleasurable activities, for her parents were leaders in the Fillmore Dramatic Society, as well as being gifted with musical talents. Around the family hearthstone the family often re-enacted stirring scenes from history or from Shakespeare, each dressing, as best he could, in character. The mother always had a lovely flower garden, and Alice early learned to appreciate the beauties of mountains, streams, blue skies, and cloud effects, as well as the glories of summer gardens and winter scenes of snowy grandeur. In fact, the love of beauty seemed to be a part of her very being, for she sought it in the everyday tasks as well as in her moments of leisure. She loved to draw, and early showed aptitude in transferring to paper the images of her mind. She was a good student also, for when but a child she took a prize in the old rock schoolhouse as the best reader. Then when but eight years old came her Great Adventure After the passing of her grandfather, George A. Smith, her grandmother ("Aunt Bathsheba" to all the other daughters of Zion) was living alone, and lonely. So she invited her granddaughter, Alice, to come to "the city" and live with her in the old Historian's Office, next to the magnificent Gardo House, which was then the official residence of the president of the Church. What a rare experience for this beauty-loving child! Here she helped her grandmother read and sort old letters, classified the hundreds of pictures her grandfather had brought from his trips to Europe and the Holy Land, met and learned to know all the great men and women of early Mormon history, who were intimate friends of her grandmother. From a child to young womanhood, she became associated with the early development of the Relief Society in the new Zion; also the Retrenchment Society, as well as the suffrage movement for Women's Rights, so-called. Meetings for these activities, as well as those of the Women's Deseret Hospital, Woman's Exponent (the pioneer women's newspaper), and many others of pioneer interest, were all conducted in her grandmother's back parlor. Alice was an ardent listener and youthful participant. It is no wonder that she became "organization-minded." When but nine years old she felt to organize RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE MARCH 1945 the young girls into a society, which they called "The Juvenile Association." She chose six counsellors  instead of two among them the youngest daughter of Brigham Young, Fanny V., Katie B. Fen ton, Lutie Y. Thatcher, Lulu Clawson, Ada Croxall, Edna Wells, with Daisy Woods, a granddaughter of Emme-line B. Wells, as secretary. They visited and prayed for the sick, and later joined, in a body, the first organized Primary Association. Meanwhile, Alice was using her pencil and sketch book as well as attending school. While in Miss Mary Cook's school, she won the prize for the best drawing a sketch from memory given by Dr. Ellen B. Ferguson. Later, she won an award given by the early Utah artist and teacher at the University of Deseret  now the University of Utah-George M. Ottinger. Still later, she won a medal offered by the artist J. T. Harwood, which was awarded by John Hafen, one of Utah's greatest artists. This was naturally a stimulus to her innate desire to produce pictures herself, and to foster in others the love of art, to which her life has been devoted. But art did not claim all her interest. In 1887, she was graduated from the University of Utah. She wrote her thesis on two of Shakespeare's women  Lady Macbeth and Ophelia. Her interest in good literature has always been keen. In 1890, Alice married George Henry Home, also a descendant of stalwart pioneers. He was an ideal husband for this talented woman, for besides being a fine man Jn his own right, he was openminded enough to recognize the gifts of his talented wife and to encourage her THE STORY OF A GIFTED LADY 153 to use them. It takes a big man to do that. In 1893, they visited the Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and later went to New York, Washington, Boston, San Francisco, and the Northwest, visiting especially the art galleries and other places of interest. In 1894, the young husband was called on a mission to the Southern States. Alice, being a good soldier, taught art in the public schools while he was gone. She also undertook serious work in art from J. T. Harwood, who had just returned from study in the Julian and Beaux Arts Academies of Paris, France. She also studied from Mary Teasdel, student of James McNeill Whistler. In 1898, she was urged by many friends to run for the legislature. In this, as in her many other activities, her husband counselled her acceptance. Said he, "Wifey," (his pet name for her) "if you want to help Utah to become art-minded, you will have to get in there and work for it." She was elected, and made herself noteworthy by introducing a bill which provided for an annual exhibition and state art collection. Georgina G. Marriott as director of fine arts at the State Fair put the exhibition into Alice's hands, and for five years she made the Art Gallery famous. Instead of giving many prizes, the best pictures were purchased, making them the property of the State as well as encouraging the artists. This greatly encouraged art studies and Utah artists also, establishing the nucleus of an art collection by the State of Utah, which was named in honor of the originator, "The Alice Art Collection.  ALICE MERRILL HORNE AS A GIRL Thus the Utah Art Institute was established, making Utah the first state in the Union to own a state art collection. Many prominent people made gifts of paintings, and this collection of over seventy pictures is now housed in the upper galleries of the State Capitol. After an existence of over forty years and an expenditure of over $60,000, the act was repealed in the interest of the so-called "Modern Art" (or is it art?) which at great expense is trying to convert the public to what is considered the New Art. Mrs. Home has remained true to her ideals of real beauty, however, and has turned much of her interest to sponsoring and providing art exhibitions for the public schools of the State. She has established over thirty art collections, of from fifteen to fifty paintings, by Utah's best RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE MARCH 1945 artists. Hundreds of exhibitions have been held, and many thousands of dollars have thus been turned to Utah artists aside from the greater value of instilling a love of beauty and art in the lives of the younger generation. For fourteen years from 1902 to 1916 Mrs. Home was a member of the Relief Society General Board, and while there was active in preparing lessons on art appreciation and landscape study, which were used by the 40,000 members of the Relief Society. A book on this subject "Devotees and Their Shrines, A Handbook of Art" was later published. Another book written in dramatic form called "Columbus Westward Ho!" was published and used in the public schools for a time. Many other interests claimed her attention during all these years of active service. She is a charter member of the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers, and was instrumental in framing its constitution and bylaws; she was also its second general president. She sponsored a "Clean Milk for Utah" campaign, and as chairman of Public Health helped, with others, to arouse enough public sentiment to cause rigid inspection to be enforced for the benefit of all, especially babies. Four milk stations were opened in different parts of the city. Many babies died in Salt Lake City among them her own baby son, George Henry, Jr.  while the next summer only one baby death was reported! Mrs. Home was also active, with others, in organizing the Smokeless Fuel Federation, and for many years has labored to encourage the use of smokeless fuel and byproducts from Utah coals. She, with other forward-looking women, was instrumental in the formation of the Women's Chamber of Commerce, which has labored to make smokeless fuel a possibility for improving the health of Utah residents and the beauty of her towns and cities. Honors Have Sought Her For her many activities, Mrs. Home has rightly received merited recognition. In 1904, she represented the National Council of Women, as well as the National Women's Relief Society, at the International Council of Women, held in Berlin, Germany. In 1934, she was chosen by the Salt Lake City Council of Women as one of the first outstanding women, named by that body, for her many contributions and life-long promotion of art among the citizens of the State. Her latest honor was received in 1942, when she was given a Medal of Honor from the Academy of Western Culture for her civic service, especially in the promotion of Utah art appreciation and production. A large reception was held in the President's Suite at the Hotel Utah, with Mr. And Mrs. Alexander Schreiner, and Mr. And Mrs. Lee Greene Richards in charge of the ceremonies. Many prominent Utahns came to meet the little lady so greatly honored. All these awards have been richly deserved, and have done honor to the donors as well as to the recipient. One might think that a life so crowded with achievement would be enough for one small lady, but there remains yet to be told Her Great Achievement' In addition to the many activities enumerated above, her greatest hon- THE STORY OF A GIFTED LADY 155 or and award is the gift of Motherhood. Six children three sons and three daughters have come to bless the home of this favored family. Five of them have grown to a useful maturity Mary, Lyman, Virginia, Zora,' and Albert. They are all members of the Church and are leaders in their fields of labor. Two of them, Dr. Lyman and Dr. Albert, are successful doctors of medicine, while the two married daughters-Mary, Mrs. Leo C. Winder, and Zora, Mrs. J. G. Jeppson are making good homes and raising fine families. They are all active in civic betterment. Mr. Home met an untimely death in 1934, mother has continued to carry on her home duties as well as her many public activities. Alice has always had a sweet, attractive face; but to those who know her best, it seems that the halo of white hair frames a face growing more mellow and charming with the passing years. Though now approaching what some may designate as 'getting on in years," she still seems as young as ever, and is active in staging art exhibits in the Tea Room or a nine-window art show at Zion's Co-operative Mercantile Institution, or some school where art-appreciation is needed. When one sees her "toting" around the heavy pictures, placing them where they receive their best light, or may be seen to the best advantage (so that possible sales may reward the artist), one feels to exclaim, "What a Woman!" How wise to foster a life interest which may remain when children are grown and home ties are lessened! How much better it is to have work to do that helps others more than oneself, rather than to sit idly at home, allowing or expecting one's children to "take care of one's old age." What a glorious thing is independence! Wliat an achievement to know that one's life work is being well done, in spite of circumstances or the passing years. Such a blessing is the well-earned reward of our gifted lady, Alice Merrill Home. And here, dear friend, while you are living and working, is our bouquet of appreciation and admiration!
