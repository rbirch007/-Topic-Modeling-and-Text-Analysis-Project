Rehabilitation of Disabled Soldiers and Sailors Excerpts from a Report, Office of War Information THE readjustment and happiness of wounded soldiers and sailors with compassionate physical disfigurements or disabilities or nervous manifestations will depend in large measure on the way their families and friends and the public at large behave toward them.
Thanks to modern therapy, many of the men suffering from even the severest wounds will be rehabilitated and enabled to lead lives of normal activity, engaging in industry, business or professions. But the most modern medical and psychiatric care, the finest surgery and appliance, expert rehabilitation, vocational training and employment opportunities are far from being all that is needed by the men who have suffered disfigurements and disabilities. The OWI passes along a number of suggestions, made by the Surgeon General of the Army, concerning everyday behavior on the part of friends, family and acquaintances most calculated to lessen the inevitable difficulties of adjustment of disfigured and disabled veterans.
If a formerly able-bodied man returns from combat with a disfigurement or other serious disability, he is almost certain to be emotionally disturbed. In other cases the wound he brings back may be mental.
In case after case, maimed young men have been freed from their black thoughts and bitterness, and have had their self-confidence restored, by the professional?expert and difficult?rehabilitation treatment they have received, as soon as possible after injury, in Army and Navy hospitals and in the hospitals of the Veterans' Administration. Disabled merchant seamen are cared for in United States Public Health Service Marine Hospitals.
In all these institutions, the restoration of self-confidence, as an aid in the restoration of physical health, is the immediate aim of doctors, nurses, and other personnel.
Details of accomplishments in the field of physical rehabilitation are becoming increasingly familiar to American readers of newspapers and magazines. Injured muscles are brought back into play, new or unused muscles are trained. When necessary, efficient surgical appliances are carefully fitted to replace amputated hands, feet or limbs.
Nervous disabilities resulting from combat experience are treated with equal care. In some cases prolonged psychiatric treatment is necessary; occupational therapy cures others rapidly.
When he has recovered his physical or psychic health and is discharged from the Army or Navy hospital, the serviceman in need of vocational training is eligible to receive it from the Veterans' Administration if he has suffered a ten percent or greater disability, resulting in a vocational handicap, while in service.
Page 176 REHABILITATION OF DISABLED SOLDIERS AND SAILORS 177 If not, the same training is open to him through the Vocational Rehabihtation Division of the United States Office of Education. Vocational training in the Veterans* Administration and other institutions is directed toward preparing the wounded man not only to fill a job in which his wound will not be a handicap, but to do important work which he will enjoy and for which he is temperamentally suited. In all cases, even those capable only of self-employment at home, the goal is useful, functional, independent living?not dependent, permanent residence in hospitals. After vocational training comes employment, and here many agencies are working for the wounded serviceman. In summary, Americans can rest assured that their wounded soldiers and sailors are being given the most modem medical and psychiatric care, the finest surgery and appliances, expert rehabilitation, vocational training and finally employment opportunities that confirm their hard-won feelings of independence. All these things are being provided, and provided by persons and organizations expert in their field, professionally equipped to further the welfare of wounded ex-servicemen. BUT the American people?the families, friends and acquaintances of the disabled and disfigured men, and the public at large?have a responsibility in the matter, too. It is up to them to further the men's progress during rehabilitation by considerate and cooperative behavior. Men who are working hard to acquire new self-confidence, or who have acquired it, must not be jolted out of it by thoughtless, uncontrolled manifestations of pity or horror or distaste or false cheeriness or too-eager curiosity or other emotionalism. For the purpose of increasing public awareness of some of the problems faced by disabled and disfigured men in their search for rehabilitation and normal living, and for the purpose of indicating to what extent public cooperation can be of benefit, the Surgeon General of the Army has set forth a series of guide-posts not only for the families and friends of such men, but for all who may come in contact vdth them. The suggestions are intended especially for the period of rehabilitation in hospitals or vocational training centers, but they also hold good for later, after the wounded men's return to civilian life: 1. Treat the maimed person as the normal person he always has been and continues to be. Disfigurement does not make him into a different person, though it may well result in his growing to be a bigger one. If you are disturbed by the disfigurement, discipline yourself so that your disturbance is not apparent. It is up to you to make him realize-without talking about it?that you feel about him exactly as always, and that his disfigurement is unimportant compared with your affection or friendship. The only difference could be an even increased respect for him. There is much to be gained from contact with a person who has suffered a handicap and overcome it. Such a person often gains extraordinary largeness of character from his RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?MARCH 1945 fight and his success; and those around him, in turn, gain from his example. Treating disabled men as normal people is particularly important in cases of mental disability. Often, in cases of this kind, the average person retains ancient prejudices, and approaches a patient either with distaste or as though he were a child or a fool. It should be kept in mind that vast strides have been made in recent years in the treatment and rehabilitation of the mentally and nervously afflicted. They are simply ill?and their illnesses are usually curable. It should be emphasized also that excessive praise of a disabled man because of his disability is not helpful. 2. Don't ask questions or give advice. The man who has been disabled or disfigured may want to talk about himself or he may not. Respect his wishes. Do not mention the disfigurement unless he does. If he does not want to talk about himself, talk about things he is interested in, or about objects in the room, or hobbies, or details of common interest. Don't talk about the war or about subjects related to his injury. Don't pry or hint. The best answer to give a wounded man who asks you "Am I going to be good for anything?" is "If you want to be good for something, determination helps." If you are related to a wounded or disfigured man, make it your business to know about the rehabilitation and accomplishments of persons as badly handicapped as he is, or more so, and be able to tell him about them ?not in a preachy way, but factually. Let him see that you know about them and that you assume he will take full advantage of his opportunities. 3. Be casual and lealistic?not over cheery. The man you are visiting may feel depressed. It is his right to feel so. It is an offense to his dignity and his common sense to go into a routine of transparent "cheeriness." The express intent of cheering up is seldom convincing or effective. Nor is it usually convincing or beneficial to try to minimize the crippling effect of maiming. By facing the reality ofc a man's disability yourself, you can help him face it. Personal anxieties and problems of all kinds lose their capacity to frighten if they are brought out into the open, squarely faced and talked about. A disfigured man who finds his friends acting naturally and casually about his disfigurement will more easily avoid being the kind of person who goes through life shrinking if a child asks, ''What's the matter with that man?" If a person has one leg, it is better to admit that fact and not try to conceal it. If one is deaf, the hearing aid should be worn openly, not treated as an embarrassing detail. A hearing aid or an artificial leg is just that and nothing more. The only difference it makes is that one hears or walks better with it than without it. 4. Don't wait on the injured man too much. Even though a disabled soldier or sailor be surrounded with sympathy, waited on hand and foot by nurses and given countless attentions, he may still despair. He may still view himself as a martyr-an attitude REHABILITATION OF DISABLED SOLDIERS AND SAILORS 179 which brings little happiness to him and no benefit to anybody else. If his faith in his ability to do things is restored the rest of the treatment is easy.
If there is something the patient can do for you, let him do it. Help-
ing others is an important part of rehabilitation. The families of men who have returned to their homes can greatly help them by letting it be seen that they expect self-reliance and cooperation, and by not being pessimistic or over-solicitous.
