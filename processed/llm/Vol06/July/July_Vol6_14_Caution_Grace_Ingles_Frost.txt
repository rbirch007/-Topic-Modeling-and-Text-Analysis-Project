Caution Grace Ingles Frost
======================================================================

CAUTION. Grace Ingles Frost. She walks not in the dark, with firm-set feet she steps, Nor hinders she her progress by crude haste, As she plods onward toward the goal ambition points. Upon her lips is placed the seal of silence, Which locked remains, save unto voice of wisdom. Her deep set orbs, alert with visual power. See life as it exists in verity. Nor read into its meaning esoterics. Her ears attuned to every key existent, Select the strain which guides to fuller knowledge, And ends upon the perfect note of peace.
