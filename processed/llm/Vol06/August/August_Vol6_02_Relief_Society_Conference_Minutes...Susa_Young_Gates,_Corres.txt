Relief Society Magazine Vol. VI. AUGUST, 1919. No. 8. Relief Society Conference Minutes. By Susa Young Gates, Corresponding Secretary. The General Conference of the Relief Society of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was held this year on June 4 and 5, just following the regular conference of the Church, and preceding the Y. M. and Y. L. M. I. A. general June conference.

The presence of President Heber J. Grant, during the afternoon session, and his encouraging talk to the sisters was greatly appreciated; while the scholarly address on the Book of Mormon by Elder Anthony W.

Every seat was taken and standing room was at a premium. The officers' sessions on Wednesday were devoted largely to careful presentation of social service problems in the morning, and of the need and value of the teacher's training work presented in the afternoon by Elder David O. McKay, and illustrated by sample
