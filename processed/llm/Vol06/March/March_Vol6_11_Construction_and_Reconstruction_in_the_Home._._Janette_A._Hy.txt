Construction and Reconstruction in the Home. Janette A. Hyde. In so far as the actual physical combat of war is concerned it is all over; but we women are now facing new conditions in our homes and with ourselves as to whether we who have won the war in the spirit of conservation, are now ready to meet the stern and self-denying needs of readjustment and rehabilitation. We are presenting our friends with these articles on construction and reconstruction in the home because this department is anxious to assist at this critical period in every possible way. Inasmuch as the clothing of the family is an important item of expense and often much wastage occurs, through lack of knowledge as to suitable material for the garments in course of construction and proper making up of such material, as well as the adaptability of the finished product, we are offering assistance to those who are interested in this subject. There are three general rules to be considered before the purchasing of material begins. 1. Price of material. 2. Suitability of material  occasions requiring same. 3. Material and styles that are suitable for making over, with or without the addition of new materials. SUGGESTIONS FOR CUTTING BLOUSES AND OTHER LOOSE FITTING WAISTS. FROM BASQUE PATTERN, DESCRIBED IN LAST NUMBER. Figures A and B show the position in which the pieces of the basque pattern are placed for a perfectly plain blouse. Note the small space between the pieces at the shoulder, which should be from 1/4 to 1/2 inch. This is always necessary and will guard against the possibility of your waists being tight when completed, as a basque is fitted much tighter than a blouse should be. The front line of the basque is generally curved; so the front line of the blouse, which is always straight, is taken from that 171 CONSTRUCTION IN THE HOME. portion of the line which comes above the bust and fits over the chest. This is shown in Fig. A. The extra amount added below the waist line is for looseness, but does not allow enough for blousing. Where an extremely loose effect is desired at the bottom of the waist, as much as three inches should be allowed. Very young girls often wear this last mentioned effect. The allowance down the center front in Fig A is for lapping and still more must be added for a hem. Many of the new waists fasten in the back in which case place the center of the front, without this allowance, on the fold of the goods. Then in cutting the backs allow the same amount in the center of the back. Many of the popular styles of waists do not have the common regulation shoulder seam, but the seam is one or two inches toward the front. Fig. C shows how this can be easily accomplished. Place the front and back shoulder of your pattern together. You may add to the back and take off the front and place your seams wherever you desire, but you must not change the shape of the neck or armhole. Figure C also shows where to fold back the pattern, if a low neck is desired. When the shoulder seam is brought forward, there is generally some fullness in the front. This may be allowed, as shown in Fig. D. Separate the two front pieces, but be sure that the points marked H and I are even on a straight line. This throws the line of the shoulder uneven, and to correct this, draw a line between the two outside points marked J and K. The amount of fullness desired can only be determined by the effect desired. The fullness may be gathered, tucked, smocked or treated in any way desired. Often smocking and tucking are done before cutting the waist. If you do this, take the precaution to see that the fullness does not spread at the bottom when the pattern is placed on the cloth, but have it come within the same space at the bottom of the waist as it does at the shoulder. Correcting and Changing of Patterns. Very often one wishes to use a pattern which is a little larger all over, or smaller all over. This often happens when a mother is sewing for children of different sizes. All patterns, bought or otherwise, may be changed on the dotted lines in Figs. E and F. To reduce the pattern, make a fold from the shoulder to the bottom, through the chest and crosswise below the bust line, in both front and back. To make the pattern larger, cut the pattern on the dotted lines and separate the pieces so as to allow the necessary amount. This will bring extra size in the proper places. Fig. G shows how to correct a line on a pattern that has 172 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. been reduced by folding out some material. All lines changed by enlarging, may be corrected and straightened as the shoulder seam in Fig. D has been treated. CONSERVATION. Underwear and hosiery can be used for making wash cloths, dusters, dustless mops, and braid rugs. Badly worn sheets and pillowcases may be carefully laundered, then torn and rolled into bandages and dressings for first-aid chest. Old tablecloths may be cut into luncheon cloths, napkins and doilies. Worn towels make wash cloths and holders. Scraps of new cloth pieced together on the sewing-machine may be used as a comfort cover. Save every usable part of cast-off textiles in the house. WASTE NOT, WANT NOT Old stockings worn at the knees can be cut off and hemmed. These make good extra socks for small children in the summer. New feet can be cut from old uppers and used. New stockings should be reinforced at the tops to keep the supporters from cutting through. Old stocking tops folded make good kitchen holders. The edges should be overcast or loosely buttonholed. Closely woven tops make warm wristlets for children. Old stockings can be made into good mittens for outdoor work. Tops, white and black are often used to make stocking caps for small children. White stocking tops may be used to piece out sleeves and legs for winter underwear or for patches. Stocking legs make good sleeve protectors. "Hopeless" stockings make good mops when cut open. Old silk stockings are fine dust cloths. DO YOU CLEAN RUGS? Washing rugs.  The cleaning of large rugs or carpets presents difficulties to the housekeeper, yet the presence of dust in floor coverings is recognized as one of the greatest enemies to good health in the home. A rather easy way to remove dust and germs from the rugs is to first sweep thoroughly with sweeper or vacuum cleaner. (One should always wear a gauze mask when sweeping, by the way). The rug should then be washed with a lather made as follows: Two quarts of hot water made into a lather with Ivory or Naphtha or some other good soap. Add to this two tablespoonfuls of household ammonia and a cupful of gasoline. Use one-half the mixture at a time and scrub the rug with a clean scrubbing brush. Use old stocking legs or other clean absorbent cloths to immediately wipe off the excess moisture. It takes about 20 minutes to go over a 9 by 12 rug in this way, and if it is properly done the nap stands up firmly and the original colors are restored, the rug having all its original freshness.
