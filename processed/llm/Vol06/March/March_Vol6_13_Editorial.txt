THE SOCIAL UNREST IN THE WORLD The world is in commotion and everywhere men's hearts are failing them for fear. Kings upon their thrones  few though there be left  are no more disturbed and anxious than are the national representatives of republican governments everywhere in the earth; for the great mass of working people have awakened to the democratic fact that men should be equalized in environment and opportunity. There are not in any section of country in this wide world of ours, with the exception perhaps among the faithful Latter-day Saints in this Church and kingdom, any people who have the right ideals and the experience to make those ideals practicable. And even we have permitted ourselves to partake of the spirit of worldliness to a degree which would imperil our existence, as a Church, unless we take warning from the conditions in the outside world, and repent and prepare to do better. The Lord, who created the earth and the fulness thereof, sent His children here, as President Daniel H. Wells used to say, "to overcome, to serve and to endure." The gifts He gave to man, He intended for use in the service of one for the other, but the inborn selfishness, EDITORIAL. 177 which is the largest part of our earth inheritance, prompts man to serve himself and his immediate family, leaving the rest of the world to get along as best it may. The Prophet Joseph Smith gave the revelation which we call the United Order, or the Order of Enoch, and which would, if followed, provide a perfect system of civil and social government. Brigham Young, in the last decade of his life, struggled hard to introduce that system amongst this people, but because he was unable to convert his own immediate associates, and because, too, of his sudden death, his plans were only partly developed and partially acted upon. He said, at the dedicatory services of the St. George Temple, that the people themselves were better prepared and more willing to try out this community plan of life than were their leaders. He added that he had found the worst obstacles to his plans amongst his own associated brethren. "And," he added, "if they and this people will not try to adopt and carry out the principles of the United Order, I don't want to live to see the kind of United Order which will come upon this world." If Brigham Young could look abroad today, he would realize that the spurious form of the United Order, which he feared, is now sweeping over the earth in place of the pure principles of unselfish brotherhood which were taught in the Order of Enoch. For that form of united interests which is now abroad on the face of the whole earth is robbed of the divine essence of inspiration, and only the husks and covering of the golden grain of truth is left for the children of men to feed upon. How his great heart would sorrow to know of the troubles that are already upon the earth and which unquestionably will increase in virulence and misery until the destruction of the wicked is complete. Men know that something is wrong with existing governments, but they do not know how to correct the evils. The intelligent observer does not so much blame the working people who combine into socialistic groups, for they have cause enough to be weary and disgusted with the selfish rule of kings and selfishly made millionaires who flaunt riches and power in the faces of weaker men, and who oppress and abuse the families of those who lack the gift to achieve and acquire wealth. Gifts and money both should be and must be held as a sacred trust from God Almighty, with which to assist and bless mankind ere we can hope to be ready for the dawning of the Millennium. Granted that there are faults  and grievous ones  on the side of the Socialists, so there are faults  and grievous ones  on the side of the rich and the powerful; all of them need the leveling influences of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 178 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. Without that neither side can hope to understand and sympathize with those of opposite beHef. And we Latter-day Saints  are we free from this canker spot in our own midst? Who are you that read these Hnes? My dear sister, does your husband own his houses and lands, farms and automobile? And how do you act towards your dependents and towards those who are poor and struggling around you? Do you help them with friendship, not pity, and with constructive opportunity, not destructive alms? And you, my dear, struggling sister, without a home and perhaps dependent upon the charity of others for your maintenance  do you resent your condition and hate those who are more fortunate than you, through circumstances or inheritance? You see, dear sisters, all this is a double-edged sword and cuts both ways. What are you doing, and what am I doing towards bringing about the pure socialistic conditions which are embodied in the United Order? I mean, what are you doing in your own home and in your own neighborhood? Suppose you ask yourself. But be assured that no matter what the answer be, this world is on the verge of a maelstrom of destruction  the war of the classes and masses is at our doors. The winding up scenes are coming swiftly into view and the saints should be warned and prepare themselves to take a sane, conservative and inspired attitude in the midst of the trying scenes which will grow in intensity from day to day, from month to month and from year to year. "And it shall come to pass, among the wicked, that every man that will not take his sword against his neighbor, must needs flee to Zion for safety. And there shall be gathered unto it out of every nation under heaven; and it shall be the only people that shall not be at war one with another. And it shall be said among the wicked, Let us not go up to battle against Zion, for the inhabitants of Zion are terrible; wherefore we cannot stand. And it shall come to pass that the righteous shall be gathered out from among all nations, and shall come to Zion, singing with songs of everlasting joy." (D. '& C. 45:68-71.) People in Zion must first prepare themselves by overcoming selfishness, through serving each other, achieve calm endurance in the midst of these preliminary trials, so that we may be prepared to receive the hosts of stricken refugees who will come to Zion for safety, and to serve them with love and unselfish ministry. The end is not far off.
