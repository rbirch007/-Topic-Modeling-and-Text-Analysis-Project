The Inner Light Lucy May Green
======================================================================

Inner Light. Lucy May Green. Jesus said, "I am the light of the world: he that foUoweth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life" (John 8:12). There is an inner light that never fades; 'Tis sunshine to the soul. What is this ray That gleams across our path by night and day? The Holy Spirit's light. What can make home a blessed, hallowed spot In palace fair or e'en the humblest cot, Tho' toil and pain and sorrow be our lot? The Holy Spirit's light. Amid earth's dross it beams like living gold, A hidden treasury of wealth untold. New hopes, new joys, new comfort it unfolds: The Holy Spirit's light. So may we worthy live, from day to day. Still o'er our path that warm effulgent ray May brighter shine until the "Perfect Day." The Holy Spirit's light.
