Editorial? The League of Nations
======================================================================

EDITORIAL. 609 Southern Democrats the credit of being honest and sincere in their opinions. Whatever opinions you and I may hold, on this League of Nations, or upon the different political party questions, let us assume and maintain one fixed standard of conduct; namely, willingness to concede to all men and women the liberty we ourselves enjoy? that of free agency, to act and think for ourselves. Moreover, let us do this generously, and in a kindly spirit. Let your sense of humor come to the rescue. We are told women have little of this saving quality. Then let us cultivate it. Don't get angry because some one differs with you in your opinion regarding the League of Nations? or any other question. Keep cool, keep sane, keep poised. Second: There is a more vital issue at stake, and that is, criticism of our honored and revered leaders. Remember, dear sisters, you and I know as we know that we live, that President Heber J. Grant's words of counsel, and his appeals to this people, are dictated by the spirit of truth, the Spirit of God. He will not lead this people astray. He is under divine guidance, and our prayers go up night and morning in his behalf. Likewise are his Counselors and the Council of the Twelve, men of God, men of prophecy and of revelation. If your friend wishes to show his reasons for his opinion, listen quietly and courteously. Show forth your own reasons with justice and sobriety. But don't argue, and don't impute wrong motives and evil intents to those who differ with you. Argument leads to evil. Avoid it. We must have and use our agency. But in the exercise of that agency let us be meek, gentle, reasonable, and generous-minded. Of such is the Relief Society. THE
