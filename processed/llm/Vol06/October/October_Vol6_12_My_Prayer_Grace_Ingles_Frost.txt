My Prayer Grace Ingles Frost
======================================================================

PRAYER. Grace Ingles Frost. Help me the meager thing of life to do, my Father, With patience and a sincere faith that you Each day are leading me the way along to higher tasks. Oh, with a wealth of buoyant song endow my soul! Give me the strength unwavering to meet The obstacle insistent! Let my feet refuse no path which You shall choose for me; Aye, with more, more perfect vision may I see to follow, All your wondrous way to own, The gleam that comes to guide me safely Home!
