"And then at that day, will they not rejoice and give praise unto their everlasting God, their rock and their salvation? Yea, at that day, will they not receive the strength and nourishment from the true vine? Yea, will they not come unto the true fold of God? "Behold, I say unto you. Yea; they shall be remembered again among the house of Israel; they shall be grafted in, being a natural branch of the olive tree, into the true olive tree." I Nephi 15:13-16. It might seem that any of the oppressed of the earth have an advocate today rather than the scattered remants of the house of Israel on this land of promise. Among the great and mighty of the earth, women, children, and the oppressed among the monarchial nations have all found their champions in the days as they pass. Lo, the poor Indian, with untutored mind, is still the victim of untold degredation, ignorance and injustice in many instances. Itwould seem at a casual glance that the artist has more interest in him than any one else. Cyrus E. Dallin, the famous sculptor, tells us how deeply impressed he was the first time he looked upon the American Indian, particularly was he impressed with his majesty. Since that time, says he, I have been trying to, make the marble statue say, This Red Man whom you would feign despise, is the very soul of majesty. Publishing houses have shown the utmost eagerness to compile and publish Indian legends. One of the best collections is that published by the Gunn and Company, the work of Mrs. Gertrude Bonnin, for many years a resident of our state, a woman who figured conspicuously in Indian affairs during the war. Then, too, it has been a matter of note that the public has been eager to expend money to catch the weird music that is part and portion of Indian festivals and dances. But the day will come when they shall be noted for power far beyond that which comes 612 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. from any art achievement of their own or any art interest they may hold for others. In fact, that day has most likely come in Mexico. Statesmen will not soon forget how formidable a foe they found in Huerta. The Book of Doctrine and Covenants tells us: "And it shall come to pass also, that the remants who are left of the land will marshal themselves, and shall become exceeding angry, and shall vex the Gentiles with a sore vexation." — Doc. and Cov. Sec. 87:5. May it not be that in the trouble that has come to Mexico, since the year 1911, that we have at least the beginning of the fulfilment of this prophecy? Of equal importance with the passages already quoted concerning the future of Lehi's people are the passages found in II Nephi 30. "And now, I would prophesy somewhat more concerning the Jews and the Gentiles. For after the book of which I have spoken shall come forth, and be written unto the Gentiles, and sealed up again unto the Lord, there shall be many which shall believe the words which are written; and they shall carry them forth unto the remnant of our seed." "And then shall the remant of our seed know concerning us, how that we came out from Jerusalem, and that they are descendants of the Jews. "And the gospel of Jesus Christ shall be declared among them; wherefore, they shall be restored unto the knowledge of their fathers, and also to the knowledge of Jesus Christ, which was had among their fathers. "And then shall they rejoice; for they sliall know that it is a blessing unto them from the hand of God; and their scales of darkness shall begin to fall from their eyes; and many generations shall not pass away among them save they shall be a white and delightsome people." — 2 Nephi 30:3-6. We have already noted in other lessons that God brings about His righteous purposes by working on natural principles. Many of the Indians are rapidly become white and delightsome through inter-marriage. Go into what ever part of Canada we may, people will tell us that the most beautiful women in Canada are the descendants of the French and Indian. We do not intend to intimate that this is the only way God has of making the Indian white and delightsome, but it is certainly one of his ways. Other factors that are at work to the end of raising the Indian out of the degredation into which he has fallen, come first from the fact that he has access to schools and colleges in various lands as well as from the fact that he has an opportunity to come in contact with the very highly developed civilization which his Gentile brethren have brought to pass. THE WOMEN'S RELIEF SOCIETY. 567 sorely needed by our hard-pressed allies and also because the example is felt far outside the field of its immediate application. Yours, faithfully, Herbert Hoover. The death grapple of the nations could be broken with victory on the side of freedom only through the whole-souled and concerted effort of our citizenry without distinction of party, creed or sex. Woman's part has been proved to be no less essential than man's. And right gloriously has the womanhood of America been sanctified by sacrifice and unwearied effort in the common cause. "Mormon" women came to the fore with their sisters of the Nation, giving gladly, not alone of their wheat and gold, of their time and effort, but, to the accompaniment of heartaches and tears, their husbands, brothers and sons. Honor to the mothers of men. INSCRIBED TO A FRIEND ON THE DEATH OF HER HUSBAND, SIX MONTHS AFTER MARRIAGE IN THE TEMPLE Emma Peterson. The twilight of your life has come.
