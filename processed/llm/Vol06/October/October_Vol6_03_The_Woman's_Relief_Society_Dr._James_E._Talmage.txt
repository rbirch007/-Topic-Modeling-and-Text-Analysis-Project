Relief Society By Dr. James E. Talmage, of the Council of Twelve. The following beautiful tribute to our sisters has appeared in hundreds of newspapers throughout the United States: The action of the Relief Society-an organization of women and the oldest of the auxiliaries within the "Mormon" Church-m turnmg over to the national Food Its accumulated stores of wheat— has been featuredAdmini stration by the press and has fonned the inspiring theme of orators on the rostrum and m Congressional halls. public The Relief Society was established under the personal direction of the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1842, and stands as one of the early, if not in fact the first, distinctive organizations of women in America. The purpose o'f its existence is the alleviation ofdistress, and from its inception the members have been as ministering angels in the homes of poverty, sicknes death. Incident to the war, its activities were mostly turned s, or Red Cross work and food conservation. to As soon as prosperity had begun to smile upon the "Mormon" fields in the Great American Desert, these big-hearted women, responsive to the counsel of their prophet-leader, Brigham Young, undertook to lay aside a little wheat at every harvest. The individual contributions ranged from half a a few bushels. This store was drawn upon to meet the peck to calls of the hungry; but, as the conquest of the desert became each year more pronounced, as the arid soil was made to yield more abundantly, the women's yearly gifts of grain increased, and from season to season the surplus accumulated. The following excerpts are taken from an able address by Hon. Milton H. Welling in the House of Representatives, June "Brigham Young fostered and encouraged as one of the auxiliary organizations of the Church the Women's Relief Society. With the main purpose of that great organization— its charitable and educational work — I am not now concerned. These women were advised as one of their minor activities to store wheat, and it is of this rather unusual activity I wish to speak. _'In the early days of Utah's history and in the humble beginning of the Relief Society, these women gleaned the harvest fields in order that no precious head of grain should be kist. Wheat was so precious to the pioneers, that it was used as a 566 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. medium of exchange. It was the standard of value by which other commodities were measured. They had little or no other currency. My own mother has related to me more than once her association with and cheerful participation in this work of gleaning the precious yellow grain. "Later on by purchase and donation these women added more rapidly to their store of wheat. As the stock grew it was moved from the small wooden granaries belonging to the local Relief Society organizations to great steel and cement elevators constructed for that purpose and controlled by the women themselves. From the beginning these women were taught that the time would come when every available pound of wheat would be needed to conserve the Nation's life and prevent famine and starvation. It has remained a strongly intrenched tradition with the women of this organization, and they believe it to be true today. "This spring, in April, there were in the elevators belonging to the "Mormon" women of Utah and other adjacent Western States 205,518 bushels of first-class milling wheat. Last month these devoted women felt that the time had come for them to use their precious savings of more than 60 years. Through the presidency of the "Mormon" Church every pound of this wheat was tendered to and accepted by the United States Food Administration for the use of the starving women and children among our allies, and for the use of our soldiers and sailors in the Army and Navy of the United States. "Mr. Chairman, I had not thought of mentioning this incident until yesterday, when I received a letter from Mr. Herbert Hoover expressing the appreciation of his administration for the assistance rendered." Mr. Hoover's letter follows: United States Food Administration, Washington, D. C, June 3, 1918. Hon. Milton H. Welling, House of Representatives, Washington, D. C. Dear Mr. Welling: The recent action of the women of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in Utah, in releasing wheat and flour for the use of our allies and our own soldiers abroad is so commendable that I wish to drop you this line merely to assure you of my appreciation of this service performed by the church. It has given me pleasure to write about this matter to Joseph F. Smith, Anthon H. Lund, and C. W. Penrose, first presidency. Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and to assure them of the renewed courage we get from this generous act, both because it yields a substantial addition of food
