The Official Round Table
======================================================================

OFFICIAL ROUND TABLE. Conducted by Mrs. Clarissa Smith Williams and Mrs. Amy Brown Lyman ANNA HOWARD SHAW Dr. and Rev. Anna Howard Shaw, world-wide leader and orator lived in Moylan, Pa. She was a clergyman, and suffrage leader. She was born in Newcastle-on-Tyne, England, February 14, 1847, and was the daughter of Thomas and Nicolas Stott Shaw. She received her education in America, at Albion College, Michigan and Boston University. Graduated in theology in 1878, and medicine, M. D., in '85. Was licensed to preach as local preacher in the Methodist Episcopal Church, in 1872; she was refused the ordination by the New England Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, on account of sex (this decision was confirmed by the General Conference in 1880); was ordained an elder in the Methodist Protestant Church, in Tarrytown, New York, on October 12, 1880, being the first woman ever ordained by that church. She was associated with Francis Willard in the temperance movement for several years, also engaged in social settlement work in Boston. She served as pastor of three different churches in Massachusetts. She became lecturer for the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association, in 1885, and was the superintendent of the Franchise Department of the National W. C. T. U., 1888-1892. She was the national lecturer for the National American Woman Suffrage Association, 1886-1904, and vice-president at large, 1892-1904, and became president in 1904. She was a member of the Methodist Protestant Church. She died July 2, 1919. Dr. Shaw was a single-minded, one-purposed woman. All her great resources of mind and soul were focussed upon the civic and social elevation of her sex. No labor was too arduous, no sacrifice too great, for her will and body to undertake, if the chosen goal was seen, if ever so faintly, at the end of the rough way. Her dynamic brain generated burning eloquence, sparkling wit, and instant repartee which poured in molten streams over her scarlet, firm-set lips with the volcano's resistless force. THE OFFICIAL ROUND TABLE. 597 Woe to the luckless male who might be caught in that red-hot flow. His scorched and mangled mental remains would lie helpless and forgotten as she marched on her triumphal path. There will be those who may question the wisdom of her life and labor — but none may doubt the singleness of her purpose, the majesty of her life's consecration. Not for personal fame nor for cheap notoriety, did Dr. Shaw enter into that frank and fearless group of women patriots who embraced such women as Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucy Stone, May Wright Sewall, Frances Willard, Rachel Foster Avery, Ida Husted Harper, Carrie Chapman Catt, and Kate Waller Barrett, offering as did they, youth, beauty, gifts, and all womanly graces on the altar of supreme sex-sacrifice. Freely she gave of what she had in over-flowing measure. That noble devotion to a cause, even if the purpose were less high, would sanctify and purify any life, and glorify any soul. In the great and busy life just before us which she has now achieved, Anna Howard Shaw will find her home in one of the heavenly mansions prepared for the just and honorable of the earth, where she will continue her labors to benefit her associates and to broaden her own eternal conceptions. She will forever hold a commanding place in the memory of all who love justice and freedom. Dr. Anna Howard Shaw was more or less intimately acquainted and associated with the leading women of this Church, Presidents Eliza R. Snow, Zina D. Young, Bethsheba W. Smith, Emmeline B. Wells had met her both here and in Washington and abroad. President Martha H. Tingey, Mrs. Clarissa S. Williams, Mrs. Emily S. Richards, Susa Young Gates, Ann M. Cannon and Ruth May Fox and Elizabeth C. McCune were all more or less well acquainted with this gifted leader and orator. President E. B. Wells was intimate with her these many years. All who knew her regret her sudden passing. May she rest, not in inactive peace, but labor in the throbbing, vital life beyond for equality and liberty of mind, sex and soul. VISIT OF MRS. PHILIP N. MOORE. The president of the National Council of Women, Mrs. Philip N. Moore, visited this city, August 10th, when she was tendered a special luncheon at the Hotel Utah.

The plan is to bring the women of the world together to work for after-war laws and to take part in international councils. They should also extend friendship to nations who do not belong to the league of nations, but who have a national women's council.

The Blackfoot stake was divided on August 9, into two stakes, one portion to be known as the Blackfoot stake and the other as the Lost River stake. The Lost River stake will include the Moore, Arco, Darlington, Ballard, Leslie and Chilly wards. Blackfoot stake will include the remainder of the wards and the officers will remain as they are at present constituted. Mrs. Ellen H. Lowry was appointed President of the new Lost River stake. Other officers have not as yet been appointed. Kanab Stake. We are very sorry to record the death of Mrs. Persis A. Spencer, Secretary of the Kanab Stake Relief Society, which occurred during the summer. Mrs. Spencer was a faithful Secretary and devoted member of the Relief Society. Mrs. Amanda C. Pugh was chosen to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Mrs. Spencer. Yellowstone Stake. The Relief Society women in the Yellowstone stake have been very active in raising funds for the stake tabernacle. This they did by holding bazaars, giving dinners and luncheons and by instituting a dime fund, which was supposed to be made up of money which would otherwise have been spent in unnecessary pleasure. The amount of cash raised was $1,000.40. In addition to this, the Society furnished carpet for the stand and aisles and furnished the Relief Society room complete, with chairs, rug, couch and table. Union Stake. Since the re-organization of the Union stake on June 22, the new Presidency, headed by Mrs. Evelyn Rosenbaum, have visited each of the wards, completing all ward organizations. At the last stake union meeting held, the Relief Society women arranged a luncheon and social at the close of the exercises, to which the Priesthood were invited. The affair was greatly enjoyed by those in attendance. In this stake a weekly stake Board meeting is held on Saturday. The slogan at present is "Increased Membership." Nebo Stake. The Nebo Stake Relief Society stake Board held a social on July 28, in honor of the ward officers and teachers, the object being to bring the officers and teachers closer together. There were over five hundred present. An excellent program was given, including a lecture by Mrs. Virginia Murdock of Provo. At the close of the program, light refreshments were served in cafeteria style, after which there was a general hand-shake and "get acquainted" hour. The guests of honor remarked over and over again that this was one of the happiest occasions they had ever known. Oneida Stake. During the influenza epidemic the members of the Oneida stake spent 1,102 days with the sick and made 1,443 special visits. A community kitchen was opened, from which 15,000 meals were furnished and taken to the families of the afflicted. During the recent stake conference held on July 13, the Relief Society choir, under the leadership of Mrs. Paul, furnished the singing for the conference, which was very much appreciated. Teacher-Training. The General Board is very much pleased with the interest being taken by Relief Society women in the Teacher-Training 600 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. course which has been established in the Church for class teachers of all of the auxiliary organizations. It is only fit and proper that since the L. D. S. Church has so many class teachers engaged in the various organizations, the Church should establish a teachers' course which will help these hundreds of teachers in the preparation of their lessons. It is to be hoped that all class teachers in the Relief Society will avail themselves of the opportunity of taking this course, which is being instituted in all of the wards. In addition to giving definite help for class teaching, it will also be educational in value. Hawaiian Islands. In a letter to President Emmeline B. Wells, from Mrs. Sarah Jenne Cannon, a member of the General Board, we learn that the letter has reached her destination in safety. Mrs. Cannon, who has relatives in the Islands, has gone to visit them and expects to be away during the winter. She will, however, do whatever she can to help the Relief Society work in this Mission. She has already visited the two branches of the Society in Honolulu and the branch in Laie. Mrs. Cannon also expects to visit Hilo. European Mission. The following announcement in the Millennial Star will be of general interest to the women of the L. D. S. Church: "Agreeable to the request of the General Boards of the Relief Society and of the Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement Association, we have pleasure in announcing the appointment of Sister Lucy E. Smith to have general charge of the woman's work as undertaken by these societies throughout the European mission. Officers of these societies are requested to take note of Sister Smith's appointment and communicate with her at the mission headquarters, 259 Edge Lane, Liverpool. The General Board has also received a letter from Mrs. Smith in which she notifies us of her appointment as President of the Relief Societies in the European mission. She has already begun her active work by visiting the Relief Societies of Liverpool and Nottingham. There are forty-two active organizations at the present time in the British Mission. During the period of the war these organizations devoted themselves largely to war work but at the present time are beginning to get back to their regular duties. Mrs. Smith reports that most of the Relief Societies are attended by men, women and children. The elders in each conference enrolling themselves as regular members. The General Board is very much pleased with the appointment of Mrs. Smith, who will surely make the same success of her work in England that she always made of every position she has ever held. Mrs. Smith is at present a member of the General Board of the Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement Association.
