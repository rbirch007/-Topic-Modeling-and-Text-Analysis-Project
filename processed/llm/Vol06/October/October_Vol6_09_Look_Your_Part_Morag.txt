Look Your Part Morag
======================================================================

Look Your Part. Morag. There is nothing that makes an efficient home-maker look the part quite so well as a neat, clean, well-fitting house dress, comfortable, tidy shoes, clean apron and neatly dressed hair. Worn out "best" clothes have no place in the kitchen, they may be colored or made over for children, or be used for quilt blocks or carpet rags, but do not inflict them on the family at breakfast time. A fancy kimona and boudoir cap are equally unsuitable. A house dress should be made of materials easily laundered. For this reason woolens or heavy materials are unsuitable unless used only as skirts, with house jacket. Dark colored ginghams, calicos and percales are to be recommended, as they wash well and are so inexpensive that any one can afford to own several. Don't make too much washing and ironing by using light and fancy ginghams. Conserve strength. A one piece style is suggested as there are no waist and skirt to be adjusted or to "part company." Sleeves should be loose and of medium length. A long, tight sleeve is uncomfortable to wear and quickly soiled. Avoid frills and ruffles, as these do not add to the appearance of the dress and also they cause extra ironing. A simple piping of contrasting material or a few scallops or touch of handwork will be trimming enough. The one piece dress is advisable for laundry as well as for comfort and it will iron much easier if it opens all the way down the front. A round or small square neck is preferable to high tight collars. Skirts should be fairlv short as they are much more comfortable to work in, look trimmer, and wear longer than the long saggv ones. Pockets should not be overlooked. Provide several aprons, large coverals for morning wear, and smaller dainty ones for the afternoon. A sweeping or dust cap may be worn in the morning, but do not attempt to hide frowsy, unkempt hair, with an elaborate confection of lace and ribbon. Let us not fail to realize how great an effect a freshly starched dress, well brushed hair, clean hands and neat, comfortable, well fitting shoes will have to do with making our day go. right. And dear, home-makers, a song in our hearts and on our lips will be a wonderful help also. Here is a hint for housewives, called a lucky pocket piece. 586 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. Make a list of the number of yards of material required to make dresses for your family. A corset cover for Sue, an apron for Mary, a petticoat for Jane, etc. Keep it in your pocket book, and whenever you are tempted to buy a remnant of material at those fascinating bargain counters, refer to it, and see if the number of yards will make anything needed by your family. If not, don't buy useless remnants. That is waste. Much saving will be effected both in money and material. Often those wonderful "bargains" are found to be of little or no use, because there is not quite enough material to make the article we had in mind. So forewarned is forearmed indeed.
