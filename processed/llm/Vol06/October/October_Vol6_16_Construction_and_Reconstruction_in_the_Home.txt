Construction and Reconstruction in the Home. Conducted by Janette A. Hyde and Lucile Y. McAllister. THE DRESS FROM THE OLD SUIT. Experience has convinced me that suits and discarded summer coats can be used most advantageously by making them over into dresses for the person having worn them. This, of course, is generally speaking, and comes with the full realization that every article remodeled is an individual problem. Many women having children seem to be of the opinion that their own clothing must be made down for the children. This often results in waste, and is extravagant instead of saving. The materials found in suits and light-weight coats is generally of good quality wool, plain color, and will stand more wear than we can possibly get out of the garment as it is first made. They may be combined with good effect with silks and satins of either plain or figured design. It is necessary to have the material of any used garment thoroughly renovated and cleaned. Carelessness in this regard may make the dress a failure before it is begun. All dust, dirt and spots must be removed, if we expect to have a second season's wear out of it. It is not always possible to accomplish this at home, and it may be necessary to send it to a professional cleaner, but be sure to send it where first-class work will be done. If the material is worth making over, it is worth a little expense to have cleaned, even if it is necessary to cut down somewhere else in expense. Take out all linings and interlinings and remove collar, cuff, etc. As the styles of the last two or three seasons have been rather close fitting about the shoulders, the chances are that you will not have to change the shoulder and arm eye. In case of the coat or jacket being too large, remove the sleeve, take in the shoulder, and under-arm seams, take the sleeve in and place it back in the arm eye. In selecting a style to follow, it is necessary to choose one which will give you a "set on" collar, so that you can entirely change the neck and front. Cuffs, of course, may be added 602 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. wide or narrow to any style so as to completely disguise the sleeve. Let me say in passing that we need be governed by style only in main lines — details are always subject to one's own taste and may often be cleverly used to hide defects. Just how the skirt or lower part of the dress is joined to the upper portion is a matter which needs some study. In this particular, necessity may cause one to deviate from the lines of the style selected, but one must be very careful not to spoil the general effect. For instance, in setting on a skirt as in Figure B, the effect would be entirely lost if the skirt were set onto the waist any lower or any higher. In selecting an overskirt style, be careful to select the length which will give the proper style to the dress, and which can best be worn by the person. Generally speaking, I would say, beware of any line which divides the skirt in the center across. Have the lines a little above or a little below the center. This fact is based upon a principle of space division and should always be remembered. CONSTRUCTION AND RECONSTRUCTION 603 These designs are two that have been used by the author this fall in remodeling old clothes. A complete description of each may be helpful and may bring suggestions to you which you may use in making your own clothes. These designs are original though similar in lines to many seen in the fall styles books. Figure A was made from a navy blue, all wool poplin summer coat purchased two years ago last March. The coat was a good hem longer than the over skirt pictured. This extra length was cut off and used as a facing on the right side. It was also loose and flaring from the shoulders with a large collar. The belt was cut from the collar and sent in the waist line. The material below the overskirt is a navy blue satin cut perfectly straight and rather tight. The collar, cuffs and little ruffles are also of the satin. The yoke and front are of fine net with a high collar. Figure B was made from a black velvet summer jacket formerly used for wearing with a light skirt. The skirt is a black tricolet attached to the velvet top with black buttons. The sash, cuffs and rolled collar are also of the tricolet. The front is of fine white organdy, tucked and trimmed with small ruffles of net. Fronts and vests of the net and organdy, lace trimmed, ruffled and tucked are very popular and add a touch of freshness and daintiness to an old dress. These vests may be bought all ready trimmed from five to seven dollars a yard, but can be made at home much cheaper; in fact, I have made them for one third that price. A
