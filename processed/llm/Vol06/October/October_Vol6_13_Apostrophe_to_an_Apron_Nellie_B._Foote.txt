Apostrophe to an Apron Nellie B. Foote
======================================================================

Apostrophe to an Apron. Nellie B. Foote. Only a worn out apron, Faded and torn and old, But gems of memory linger In every wash-worn fold. Long since, it was new and dainty, And crisp as a fresh blown rose, It fluttered with happy heart-beats, And quivered with pent-up woes. It shared in the joys of morning And drooped in the noon-day heat, And over the sink at evening Its day was made complete. It left its place in the kitchen When it hung on a wooden peg To shoo the hen from her laying And gather the golden egg. It hazed the sheep from the meadow, And drove the cows from the corn, And left a piece of its fabric Adorning a crumpled horn. It furnished a wee postillion With lines for his coach and four, And served as a sail for the wash tub Afloat on the kitchen floor. It tested the heating curlers, Ere winding the locks of gold, And covered the baby kittens Away from the damp and cold. It carried the chips from the wood-shed, With never a frown nor moan, And wielded the red-hot poker With a grace that was all its own. It has oft been used for a sunshade When, over the alley gate, APOSTROPHE TO AN APRON. 591 The neighbors met to gossip And all the news relate. It helped the busy house-wife To cover a toil-grimed frock, When an unexpected caller Arrived at ten o'clock. How oft as a cradle pillow It cuddled away to rest The dear little sleepy darlings Held close to its gingham breast. It chased the rampant chicken And swatted the festive flies, And dried the tears of anguish Out of the kiddies' eyes. It held the truant puppy Tied fast to the garden gate, And made a towel for father When he came in tired and late. Across its checkered fullness, An erring boy has bent, While sounds of castigation The brooding stillness rent. It dusted the chairs and table, And polished the window pane, And made a tent in the dooryard Held up by a bamboo cane. It shielded from frost the porch box, Or the basket hanging high, And waved a friendly greeting To the early passerby. Its long, long life of service And kindly deeds well done Demand our approbation, And praise from everyone. But now, alas! 'tis ended, Like many a worn out coat, Its last great act of service, — A lunch for the Billy Goat. The
