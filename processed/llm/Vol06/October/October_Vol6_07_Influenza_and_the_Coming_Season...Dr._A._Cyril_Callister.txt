Influenza and the Coming Season...Dr. A. Cyril Callister
======================================================================

Influenza and the Coming Season. Dr. A Cyril Callister, of the Department of Preventive Medicine and Hygiene, University of Utah. Will the influenza epidemic return in the fall of 1919? And if it does, how severe will it be? If it does return, has medical science progressed in its ability to cope with it? These are two pertinent questions which have presented themselves and are bothering the medical man and layman alike. To answer the first question, we must look back into medical history; and for the second, delve into current medical literature and research on the subject. Influenza apparently is not a new disease, but has been with us always in the endemic form. We have medical history to point out that it has occurred in epidemic form at intervals of from thirty to forty years ever since the early part of the seventeenth century, and doubtless occurred before that time. It has not been always known as influenza, but has gone under various names such as Russian Disease, and Tyler's Disease — when an epidemic of this malady broke out during Tyler's campaign. The most recent epidemic before the present one, began in the latter part of the year 1889, and reached its height probably in the spring of 1891, and according to Dr. Frost (Journal American Medical Association), showed a development of three distinct phases; the first culminating in January, 1890, the second in April and May, 1891, and the third in January, 1892, the virulence of the disease rising and falling between these periods. Another interesting fact shown by the mortality charts is that the death rate is higher than normal in pneumonia, for several years succeeding the influenza epidemic. In discussing the epidemiology of influenza, two more questions must be brought before the reader: First, is this epidemic disease, called by us influenza, the same disease that occurred in epidemic form in 1889-91 and in preceding epidemics mentioned? Second, Is this epidemic influenza the same disease that exists endemically among us at all times? The writer is unable to give a conclusive answer to either, because, so far the bacteriologist has failed us. Dr. Pfeiffer, some two or three years after the epidemic of 1891, isolated a bacillus from endemic cases which he assumed to be the cause of influenza, and which was generally accepted as such; but during the present epidemic intensive investigations bya number of bacteriologists have tended to prove 582 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE, that, on the whole, the so-called influenza bacillus is not the sole cause of influenza, but is at most only a contributing factor. We must therefore depend on clinical evidence for the establishing ofthe identity of the disease in the epidemics. This we can do by reading the records of the older physicians relating to the previous epidemic, where we discover that the description of the signs, symptoms and course of the disease are identical with the present — the one flaw being that the mortality of this epidemic has so far been higher than in previous epidemics of which we have accurate figures. In answer to the second question as to the identity of epidemic influenza and endemic influenza, we can only point to the fact that the clinical symptoms are similar but milder in the endemic form. If the influenza epidemic runs true to form, it will undoubtedly recur in the coming fall and winter of 1919. Now arises the questions as to its severity when it does begin again. In the epidemic of 1889-91, the second phase was more severe from the mortality table viewpoint than the first. There is considerable doubt, however, if this will obtain in this epidemic, because of the widespread incursions into the population during the first wave which have established a relative immunity to the disease on the part of a large number. It is true that a person may have influenza two or three times, but it is also true that a certain amount of immunity is bestowed on the individual by an attack. This is demonstrated by the fact that the disease occurs in epidemic form in periods about a generation apart. Still more weight is added to this belief in that the incidence of influenza was very much greater in persons under thirty years of age than in those past forty, thus justifying the assumption that many persons over forty possessed an immunity conferred by an attack in the previous epidemic. Now, in regard to the ability of the public health officials to control it, and the physician to combat it. To suppress any epidemic, it is essential to know the method of communication of the disease. While the belief is general among medical men that influenza is a contact disease, yet exhaustive eflforts on the part of Dr. Roseneau and his colleagues to transmit the disease to others and thus determine its mode of spreading have availed nothing. Strict quarantine, wearing of masks, etc., appear also to have affected the curve showing the rise of the incidence of the disease in the community not one whit. So far, then, little or nothing has been discovered in aiding to control the disease. As to treatment of the sick individual, research in this branch has been taken up by the army, navy, private clubs, hospitals, municipalities, research laboratories, and many others. INFLUENZA AND THE COMING SEASON. 583 The treatment' at first was only supportive. In the winter of 1918, at the Chelsea (Mass.) naval hospital, following the lead of the treatment of infantile paralysis, blood serum from convalescent patients who had been suffering with a well defined influenza-pneumonia was injected intravenously into patients ill with the disease. The results were very encouraging, and the treatment was then tried out fairly extensively by Massachusetts hospitals and by the Massachusetts board of health. The results still were quite encouraging, authough the epidemic was on the wane and its virulence decreasing; yet the proportionate mortality was reduced so greatly that credit is justly due to the treatment. In conclusion, I find: That it is probable that the country will experience another wave of influenza during the fall and winter of 1919; that this wave will not be as widespread as the preceding one; that we have gained little or nothing in the control of the disease; and that, at present, the only treatment showing promise of benefit is the use of convalescent blood serum. Prune or Date Salad. — Take steamed Prunes or Dates remove pits, fill cavaties with nut meats. Roll in pulverized sugar. Serve on lettuce leaf with whipped cream dressing or dressing made from the juices of fruits. Honey Whip. — Whip together one-half cup of honey and enough cream or marshmallow dressing to make a pint. Serve on fresh fruits or as a filling for tarts with grated orange peel and nuts over the top. Honey whip and fresh figs make a delicious dessert. Preserving with Honey. — Honey imparts a particularly delicate flavor to canned fruit and preserves made with honey are counted among the expensive luxuries. In recipes for preserving and canning substitute honey for sugar pound for pound, or use two cups of honey for three cups of sugar. Honeyed white grapes. — Select the small white seedless grapes. Remove stem and wipe dry. Prick each grape with a needle. Make a sirup of one cup of honey to one cup of water, bring to a boil, add grapes and let it simmer a few minutes. Pack fruit into hot sterilized jars, fill with,sirup, adjust covers, and sterilize under boiling water 12 minutes for pint jars. Tighten covers and test for leaks. To a
