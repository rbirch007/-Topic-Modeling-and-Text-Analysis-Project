Why Not? Mrs. Parley Nelson
======================================================================

Why Not? By Mrs. Parley Nelson. The pathway is rugged, my feet have grown weary, The skies are o'ercast and the day seems so dreary; Aly burden grows heavy as onward I go, Dear heart, if you love me, why not tell me so? Love would smooth the rough path, and my heart would be singThe skies would seem bright and the joy bells be ringing. My cross would grow lighter as onward I go. Dear heart, if you love me, why not tell me so? Do not wait 'till I've passed through the gateway eternal, Where the peace and the rest and the joys are supernal; There the winds of adversity no more shall blow Dear heart, if you love me, why not tell me so? More precious are loving words now, than the flowers Which may cover my grave when I've finished earth's hours. Then rest will be perfect from sandal to brow; Dear heart, if you love me, why not tell me now?
