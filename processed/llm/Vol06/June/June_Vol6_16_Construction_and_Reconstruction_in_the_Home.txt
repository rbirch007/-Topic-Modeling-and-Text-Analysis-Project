A large person will, of course, require more material. To Cut the Two-Piece Skirt. First, cut and fit a yoke pattern as described in our last number. Be very accurate and careful in doing this, as the skirt perfectly shaped from the beginning is always more successful than the one which has to be altered greatly. The drawing will show the use of yoke pattern, in shaping the two-pieces, front and back. The skirts having the seam directly over the hip and exactly half way between the center of the front and the center of the back have always appeared more satisfactory to me, though many of the models have the seam just a little toward the front. This is merely a matter of taste, but you must decide and then divide your yoke pattern into front and back accordingly. Personally, I prefer to fold half the yoke pattern (from the center of the front to the center of the back) into two equal parts, but be careful not to confuse them as there may be.some difference in their shape. The width at the bottom, of course, changes with the style. This year they are very narrow. However, the sensible woman 356 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. will not wear a skirt less than one yard and twenty-one inches, which allows a comfortable step. Stout women require at least two yards at the bottom of the skirt. The pattern may be cut of brown wrapping paper, or if one has had experience in cutting it, the shape of the gores may be marked on the wrong side of the material with chalk. A yard ruler is a great help in drafting a skirt. Figure I shows the front gore. A is the front half of half the yoke pattern, B shows the treatment of the side. The straight line from the bottom of the yoke pattern to the bottom of the skirt leaves a sharp angle at the hip. In narrow skirts, round the side out as shown here. This will make the skirt more ample through the center. C shows how the skirt may be added to and made fuller. Figure II shows the back gore with fulness allowed in the center of the back. At least two inches on the fold can be used in the back for gathers. Many women in making their skirts are allowing still more ? enough to make an inverted pleat down the center of the back, to be used in making the skirt fuller when style,so demands, as may be the case even before the skirt has been worn one season. A shows the back half of the yoke, B shows the method of treating the angle at the hip line. The fulness allowed in the back makes the curve over the hip unnecesary, so a straight line may be made from the top of the skirt to the bottom. C shows how the back gore also may be made fuller, D shows the fulness allowed in the back. In case you have divided your yoke pattern so that the seam comes a little to the front, you cannot divide the fulness at the bottom in half. The back will, of course, have to be wider in order to be consistent with the top. Note how the curve at the top is extended over the fulness at the back. In cutting, allow one inch seams and about three inches for a hem. The proper length of the tailored skirts at present is about five inches from the floor. It is to be hoped that it will remain so, as it is very much more becoming and sensible than shorter or longer skirts. Next number will treat the making and finishing of the tailored skirt. Oh The
