She read in the blessed beatitudes those promises he let fall, "Let him who would be greatest among vou, become the servant Decidingof toall.co" py her Master, whose complete effacement of self Caused him to be worshiped by Saints, despisers of pride and pelf. She's now a most happy woman, whose life is grand and sublime. She has a kind word for all ? she's doing good all the time; Earth's good things are hers to enjoy, from duty she doesn't swerve She is the happiest woman alive, for she now has learned to serve. She is cheerful and gentle and loving, since she has learned how to live, Her sorrows are swallowed in joys, since she has learned how to forgive; She is free from the cunning of Satan, who sought to allure her to sin. Her hours are spent in seeking the souls of her loved ones to win; Honor and glory and wisdom wait on her unselfish call, For she loves and has patience with all, and she is now loved by ail. The
