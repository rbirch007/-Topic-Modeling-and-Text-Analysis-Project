For Time and Eternity Lucy May Green
======================================================================

Time and Eternity. Lucy May Green. "I cannot go to the temple, Ronald. Mother has set her heart on a home wedding for us, and she has planned such an elaborate reception! We are to be married by our old Bishop, in the alcove in the drawing-room, standing under a big floral horseshoe, for luck, you know. And my dress, wh|r it's a perfect dream with a low neck and real lace sleeves. It an exquisite evening gown, Ron, and will come in so handy for the theater and parties!" And the happy girl smiled at her love. "My trousseau, too, you just can't imagine how lovely the tmngs are which mother and the girls have made for me  all tattilg and crochet, such laces and embroidery! I shall want to wef r chiffons and crape all my life, just to show them off." "But Edith dear," replied the man, "there Ire other things to think of besides crepe dresses and embroidery. Our love should be the greatest thing in all the world just now. We want to be married in the temple! we don't want to be united for time alone, but for all eternity; and,- dearest, I do not care so much for your many fine clothes; you always look well dressed to me. But there is one article we must both wear andlcherish, and you know what that is." "Oh," pouted the girl, "I don't want to weat long sleeves and high necks, for they are so hot and uncomfortable. My dresses are almost all made with elbow or shorter sleeves and no collars, and I won't be able to wear any of my pretty yokes. Let's wait awhile, Ron; there will be plenty of time lateron to do temple work. I want to have a good time, now." "Dearest," returned her lover sadly, "we must begin right. Many years ago I received the Priesthood. I have lived a clean and true life, have respected my calling and have looked forward with joy to the time when I might be ordained to the higher ofiice, and in the House of the Lord receive the woman who was my true mate. You have ever been my ideal woman, Edith; do not fail me now. I love you, dear, not only until death does Us part, but for time and all eternity." "If you loved me like that," flashed the girl, "you would let me get married in my own way. I'm willing to go to the temple some day  in a year or two, after we've had a good time in society for awhile. You must go now, Ron, for I hear the dressmaker coming for a fitting. Good-bye, Ron; time enough for serious things in ten years from now," smiled the vivacious girl, as she FOR TIME AND ETERNITY. 93 eluded Ron's good-bye kiss, and disappeared into the sewing room. "How I love her," thought the man, as he walked through the quiet streets to his home, where he sought the silent solitude of his own room. "Father in heaven, open her eyes," he cried, as he knelt in prayer. "Take from her heart the desire for worldly things. Open up the way that my heart's dearest wishes may be speedily realized, if it be thy will," he prayed earnestly. Ronald Lancaster and Edith Arvor had been playmates in early childhood, friends through school days, and lately their friendship had ripened into love. A legacy recently received by Edith's mother had made an elaborate trousseau possible, and Edith's head had Seen slightly turned by the many attentions paid her by the sociaf leaders of the town, and through the allurement of the fine clothing she had been able to obtain. A few days later Edith attended an afternoon musicale given by Mrs. Vandercort, who was one of the local society leaders, in honor of a visiting musician, a contralto of widcrepute. "Our singer went for a ride through the canyon this morning and has not yet returned," announced the hostess to her assembled guests. "Just visit and amuse yourselves fo/ a little while. I think I hear her auto returning now." Edith joined a group of friends on the spacious veranda, and a hum of conversation, broken at times with the click of knitting needles, soon ensued. "What exquisite tatting that lady is wearing, and did you ever see such a pretty yoke," remarked one of her companions to Edith in an audible whisper. "She is a 'Mormon,' too," she continued. "How can you tell that?" queried Edith. "I can see the outline of her underwear," replied the girl. "Do you know," she continued, "I believe in all the principles of the Church, but I just can't stand the underwear. I have to wear it, of course, but I tuck in the neck and roll up the sleeves, and"  whisper  "I have one pair I fixed up to wear with evening dresses  " "Girls," the lady of the tatting said gently, "I could not help hearing your remarks, and it grieved my soul to hear you speak slightingly of sacred things. May I tell you a story?" The distinguished girls blushed and murmured an apology, and the lady continued "Twenty years ago Ruth Alston was the belle of our little village, an exquisite needlewomlm. Ruth's dresses and underwear were elaborately trimmed with embroidery and lace, the work of her own hands. In the late nineties the girls wore sheer organdy dresses with many n|ffles, These were made over colored 94 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. slips, often of pink or flesh color. Sleeves were omitted and the tops were cut low so that dimpled arms and necks could show through the sheer organdy of the dress. Ruth was engaged to a young civil engineer who was surveying some Government land in our neighborhood. He was a recent convert to Our faith, and full of enthusiasm. He desired to receive the Priesthood and to be married in the temple, but Ruth discouraged this. She had set her heart on having an organdy wedding dress, with six bridesmaids, flower girls, with an elaborate ceremony in her home. Ruth's slightest wish became law with her future husband, and it was a very imposing wedding. Everywhere was pink and white roses, and Ruth the bonniest rose of them all, in her organdy dress and white veil; but my heart ached for them, for I knew they had not made the right start. "Years passed. Ruth and her husband prospered. Five lovely children blessed their union. Later the family moved to Boston, where John Enright, Ruth's husband, occupied an important position in Government service. Ruth was received into society and became an ardent worker in club circles and suffrage associations. "A subject of great interest, studied by one of the clubs, was ancestry. Some of the members proudly traced their pedigrees back to the Pilgrim fathers. Ruth became intensely fascinated in this line of work, and took a course of study at the genealogical library. "One day she discovered a book for sale at an old book store, The History of the Alstones. She purchased it and found it to contain a direct pedigree of her father's ancestors, going back for many generations. "About this time reorganization of the branch of the Church in Bo.ston took place, and Ruth found herself president of the Relief Society there. The course of study in genealogy and salvation for the dead was then in its earlier stages, but in preparing the lessons to give to her sisters of the Relief Society Ruth, for the first time in her life, received a testimony of the truth of the gospel, and with that testimony came an ardent desire to return home where she could obtain the privileges of the House of the Lord for herself and labor in behalf of her kindred dead. Her husband caught her enthusiasm, and as soon as he could obtain a transfer to the Western division, they gave up their home in the East and Then turned the faces home their accident to the mountains of the Lord's House. occurred. A train collision took place and many people were injured. Ruth was pinned beneath a seat on the train by a falling piece of timber and when she was released and later discharged from the hospital and returned home, she was a helpless cripple who could never walk again." FOR TIME AND ETERNITY. 95 "And could she not go to the temple?" queried Edith, while her companion sobbed audibly "Yes," the gentle voice continued, "a special chair was made for her, and she had that great privilege once, but the effort almost cost her her life, so that now she has to be content to stay at home while others do the temple work. She has copied hundreds of names from her book on to temple sheets, and she is still an expert fancy worker. She makes crochet and tatted yokes for sale. This of mine was a present from her." A few bars of opening music, and a glorious contralto voice came through the open window, "I will rejoice greatly in the Lord, for He hath clothed me with the garments of salvation; He hath covered me with the robe of righteousness. Arise, put on thy beautiful garments, oh daughter of Zion." A thoroughly repentant and chastened Edith hastened home at the close of the musicale, and when Ronald called that evening he found that his earnest prayer had indeed been answerd, and latr over for time and the all altar in the Lord's House they pledged thir troth eternity.
