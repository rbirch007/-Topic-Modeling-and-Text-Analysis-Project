To a Sleeping Child A. B. Christenson
======================================================================

SLEEPING CHILD. A. B. Christenson. Sweet spirit from a brighter sphere, In mould of earthly sod; What mysteries of life lie here! Still point to heaven and God; Descended, yes! through tangled chains Of mundane pain and strife; Yet, in thy cherub-form there reigns Divine, a higher life. 'Tis sleep that gives thee glimpses fair Of scenes in worlds above, Communion with the angels there, And heavens of pristine love; Thy slumbers are like timely rain And sunshine in green bowers; They warm and cheer to life again The drooping buds and flowers.
