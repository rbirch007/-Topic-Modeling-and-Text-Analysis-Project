The New General Superintendency of Sunday Schools William A. Morton
======================================================================

New General Superintendency of Sunday Schools. William A. Morton of the General Sunday School Board. When the announcement was made that Elder David O. McKay, of the Council of Twelve, had been chosen to succeed the late President Joseph F. Smith as General Superintendent of the Sunday Schools of the Church, expressions of hearty approval were heard on every hand. No better selection could have been made, for, apart from his calling as an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, Elder McKay is, above all else, a Sunday School man. He was cradled in the Sunday School; in his childhood it was his nursery; in his youth his guiding star. His love for the cause, his long years of devoted service to it, the great experience he had acquired as an officer and also as assistant to President Joseph F. Smith, fully qualified him for the exalted position to which he has been called. His love for little children is unbounded, and he possesses the rare gift of being "able to reach them." We have seen hundreds of little ones sit spell-bound while he taught them the ways of the Lord, and told them about the blessings which he as an individual had received from his heavenly Father. In Superintendent McKay, the youth of Zion have a father and a friend. Around the neck of many a wayward boy his big, brotherly arm has been placed while he pleaded with the erring one to forsake the paths of sin and to turn his feet into the ways of righteousness. He has been the means in the hands of the Lord of bringing peace to many a troubled conscience, joy to many an aching heart, and sunshine into many a home that had been darkened for years. He is loved and honored by all who know him, and their name is legion. He has the faith and prayers of all 78 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. Israel that the Lord may continue to bless him and give him much joy and success in the work to which he has consecrated his life. As might have been expected, when Elder McKay was chosen General Superintendent, Elder Stephen L. Richards, also of the Council of the Twelve, was chosen as his first assistant. The souls of these two men are knit as closely together as were the souls of David and Jonathan and Joseph and Hyrum. We know of no better team of Church workers. Elder Richards, like his file leader, has had many years of experience in Sunday School work. He is a man of good, sound judgment, and during the years he has been in the Superintendency he has assisted materially in bringing the Sunday School work up to its present high state of perfection. He is a man of sterling character, and his life is an inspiration to all Church workers. His presence at Sunday School conventions and conferences is always hailed with delight, for officers and teachers know that they will receive from him the help they need in order to make their labors more successful. We extend to Elder Richards our hearty congratulations, and wish him continued success in his ministry. With the elevation of Elder Stephen L. Richards to the office of First Assistant Superintendent, the genial Secretary of the Deseret Sunday School Union Board, Elder George D. Pyper, also received well-earned recognition, he having been chosen to fill the office of Second Assistant Superintendent. This appointment has also met with universal favor. His experience of many years as General Secretary of the Union Board has made Brother Pyper familiar with Sunday School work, and has thoroughly qualified him for his new position. He is beloved by all who know him for his breadth of vision, his soulful music, his cheerfulness, his kindness, his wide sympathy, his brotherly love, and many other virtues. In him the Sunday Schools of the Church have a valuable asset. Long may he live to put sunshine into the souls of his fellow-mortals, and to point out to the young, in song and story, the way to a still higher and a better life. Educators in this state tell us that nearly half of our children do not receive a high school education. This is unfortunate for the child, as it is a handicap throughout life; for the parents, who lose the trained help and resulting joy from the full preparation of their children to face life; and most of all, it is a loss to the state and to our Church, who are thus deprived of fully trained intelligences to develop and carry forward the upbuilding of civil and religious righteousness. Mothers can help in this matter by exercising a little more self-sacrifice and in encouraging sons and daughters to make greater efforts to pass through high schools and colleges. Men cannot be saved in ignorance, now or ever. B. H. ROBERTS A. W. IVINS R. R. LYMAN The
