Lines to a Mother in Israel. Alice Foutz. It is the soul's celestial grace That shines from out her gentle face; It is the charm of heart and mind That in her presence are combined,  A saintly wife and mother true, A "Mary Magdalene," through and through. She knows and does her duty well. Had I the gift, to you I'd tell How she in her sweet, quiet way Doth bless and comfort, day by day; Her beauty, goodness and gentle mein Befit her in her sphere to reign. The many souls she's fed and feeds. The noble life she's led and leads, Has lent her grace and strength of mind To reign a queen among her kind; Whilst Thou canst spare her from Thy side, Dear Lord, may she with us abide.
