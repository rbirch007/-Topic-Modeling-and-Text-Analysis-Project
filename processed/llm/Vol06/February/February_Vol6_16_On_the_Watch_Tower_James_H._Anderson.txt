On the Watch Tower James H. Anderson
======================================================================

WATCH TOWER James H. Anderson. The more notable topics of public discussion in December were: 1st  Spanish influenza, wherein the re-breathing under masks is held by physicians to offset in harm the protection given; vaccination is reported from a test of 1500 cases in Boston to be of little value, since the disease does not render the person immune from a re-attack and consequently the vaccine cannot do so; strict quarantine and complete isolation are the most effective measures yet demonstrated. 2nd  Peace negotiations, in which President Wilson's views have been broadened by his visit to Europe, where his "fourteen points" received typical characterization by Premier Clemenceau of France: "Too many; the good Lord gave but ten." 3rd  Control of all railways, cable, telegraph and telephone lines by the government to the extent of dictating all lines of communication and transportation, which is not favored by Great Britain, as shown in that government's reply to Canada that such a thing would not be submitted to for lines landing on British soil; and which also is strenuously opposed in this country as it would be a suppression of correct information and of the freedom of the press and of speech in the United States. These three topics disclose such a pronounced difference of opinion as to suggest that "peace on earth" even within nations, not to say among all nations, is still far distant. At the same time, the prospective opening to full religious liberty of the South American republics, of Palestine and other parts of Asia, and of all the European nations in due time, is indicative of the approach of a period when Elders of Israel shall "preach the gospel of the kingdom in all the world for a witness before the end shall come" to world disputes and crime. ON THE WATCH TOWER. 109 Gen. Allenby and a British army entered Aleppo in December, thus relieving all of Mesopotamia and Syria from Turkish control. A United States of the World is being advocated by the Non-Partisan League in the United States, but is not due to attainment just yet. Women knitters for the Red Cross received orders on December 28 to quit the work; many household needs in that line now may get attention. Aerial flight across the Atlantic, from Canada, with a 2000 horse-power airplane carrying four men, is scheduled for January by a Canadian aviator. Bolshevism in Russia is still carrying on its reign of terror, although little news thereof is permitted to reach the public in other countries. The American battle fleet, comprising most of the American warships which have been in European waters, returned to New York in December, and there received a great ovation. Nearly 500,000 enemy aliens in the United States were released by order of President Wilson in December, the necessity for their internment no longer existing. Berlin has been the scene of severe rioting and fighting several times during the month of December  an indication that German unity may have to stand the test of another revolution. Jewish government in Palestine under British suzerainty is now sought by the leaders in the Jewish Zion movement, with excellent success in prospect for that solution of the problem. Austria suffered less in December than in November, from internal disturbances, the people there seeming to realize that it is better to go to work and produce food than to fight and starve. Portugal, although a republic in Europe, did not escape the assassin's hand as in December, the president of the republic having been murdered to board a railway train. Food regulations in the United States were modified on January 1st, with the effect that flour took a small rise in price, the prospect for a scarcity in 1919 not having disappeared. 110 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. Judge W. M. McCarthy of the Utah Supreme Court died during December. He had been a member of that court for sixteen years, and stood high as an upright, conscientious judge. Hasty marriages to young soldiers are netting a large crop of deserted wives in the United States, making it necessary for new army regulations to prevent such unions. Emperor William II of Germany abdicated in December, and he and his friends engaged in an effort to prove that he was not personally responsible for starting the great European war. Control of operation of all means of transportation and of communication by wire is being sought by national government officials in the United States, and is meeting with strenuous opposition. Ireland proclaimed an Irish republic on Christmas day; many thinking people outside of Great Britain feel that Irish independence is an unsuccessful experiment under existing circumstances. The Peace Conference in Paris, although scheduled for January, is likely to carry its deliberations through February, there being twenty-seven nations represented at the conference. State control of practically everything is being urged by certain theorists until it looks as if the next stage of government in the United States will be an official autocracy and popular slavedom. Women candidates for the House of Commons in Great Britain all were defeated in the December elections there, the chief reason being that those candidates had aligned themselves with the laborite party. Mexico's Carranza government is headed for an early dissolution, according to reports received at the close of December. There will be neither disappointment nor weeping in this country at such an outcome. Brigadier-General Richard W. Young, of Utah, made a short visit to his home State on his return from France, January 1. Brigadier-General Frank L. Hines, also of Utah, made a short visit at Christmas. ON THE WATCH TOWER. 111 Influenza claimed over six million victims by death in the last four months of 1918, according to statistics gathered in London; and the pestilence is in the world yet. The total deaths reported in all armies during the war is just under six millions. Turkey now asks the Entente allies to aid in reorganizing that country. This assistance probably will take from Turkey all of Syria and Mesopotamia on the east, and all European territory, which includes Constantinople, on the west. Conscription for the United States in raising armies is the plan of a measure introduced into Congress. The British premier David Lloyd George says the only way to secure peace in Europe is to abolish conscription everywhere. Asleep for twenty-one days is the experience of a five-year-old daughter of Robert L. Moyes, of Ogden, Utah, in December, following an attack of influenza. At the close of December the child had awakened, and there seemed a fair prospect of recovery from the illness. In the British elections in December, the ministry of David Lloyd George received overwhelming endorsement from the people of Great Britain, men and women voters. This will give the British premier especial strength in the peace negotiations, his people being almost unanimously behind him in policy. At Chicago, in December, professors of high rank in the educational world testified in a sedition case on trial that the most dangerous faddists in the country had an abundant membership in the school-teaching profession. Utah people may some day awaken to a sense of that same fact. President Wilson was received in Europe, in his visit there in December, with the cordial welcome befitting that due to the great nation which did so much to bring to a successful close the war that for so long threatened the destruction of popular government. He also has obtained much first-hand knowledge of what the nations of western Europe have had to suffer.
