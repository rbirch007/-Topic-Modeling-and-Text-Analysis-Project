The sweetest, grandest, noblest word of all, That man with all his weaknesses is proud to speak; The word that moved men to their greatest deeds withal, And in its praise, e'en poets' sweetest words are weak ? That word is "Mother." There is a name more sacred far to me Than power or fame or even sweetheart's love; That name I'll love through all eternity. It is God's greatest blessing from above, That name is "Mother." What pain or woe would she not bear for me? With courage strong and love that's stronger still; Great mental doubts and spirit pangs bore she. Yet slander could not move her changeless will, My loving Mother. What may I do in part as payment here below. To Mother who has done so much for me? O, Surely, 'tis a life-long debt I owe; And will I shirk responsibility? No, no, my prayerful Mother. That spotless name and honor that you gave to me, I'll keep as pure and spotless as I can; And all the stains from which your love hath saved me, I'll hold far from me, for I'm now a man, My pure and gentle Mother. The Editor of Relief Society Magazine, Salt Lake City, Utah. My dear Editor: I am enclosing a "Mother's Day'' contribution, which you may see fit to use in your Society publication. It is not much of a poem, I know that, but perhaps a little help from you will make it presentable. It was written when I was only 16 years old ? in the summer of 1917, for the dearest mother in the world. I^had been going through a particularly trying period a period of temptation and wildness common to many boys, and my mother, with her loving cheer and enduring faith in her boy's possibilities, came to my rescue as only a true mother can, and understood me and sympathized with me when I needed it most. The verses were a spontaneous tribute to my mother, Mrs. Wm. H. Smart, of Roosevelt, Utah. Your paper is a source of inspiration and material aidelders. to the sisters in our conference, and therefore a great help to the You have my hearty wishes and prayers for success. Sincerely your brother, Elder Jos. H. Smart. Box 417, Chattanooga, Tenn., Mar. 28, 1919. MARGARET JUDD CLAWSON. Mother of President Rudger Clawson. THE Relief Society Magazine Vol VI. MAY, 1919.
