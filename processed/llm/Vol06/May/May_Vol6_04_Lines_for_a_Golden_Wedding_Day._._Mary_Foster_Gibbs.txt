Lines for a Golden Wedding Day. . Mary Foster Gibbs

Wedding of Mr. and Mrs. Charles W. Nibley. Presiding Bishop Charles W. Nibley and his wife Rebecca Neibaur Nibley celebrated their golden wedding anniversary, which fell on Sunday, March 30, with a reception at the Hotel Utah on Saturday evening, March 29. While many invitations were sent out for the affair, the bishop and his wife publicly invited friends who missed receiving one for the informal celebration of the passing of the 50th milestone in their married life. Music and refreshments accompanied the general festivities. Bishop and Mrs. Nibley were married March 30, 1869, in the old Endowment House, President Daniel H. Wells performing the ceremony. The Bishop was but 20 years of age and his wife had just turned 18 on the day of their marriage. As days of taxicabs and cars had not yet arrived, the pioneer youth and maiden walked, through eight inches of snow, from the bride's home on Second East street to be married. Alexander Neibaur, father of the bride and a well-known local Hebrew poet and scholar, and Mrs. Elizabeth C. Crismon, then Miss Cain, the bride's closest girl friend, witnessed the ceremony. Appropriately, Mrs. Crismon assisted Bishop and Mrs. Nibley in receiving their guests in the Hotel Utah. Mrs. Nibley was born in Salt Lake City, March 30, 1851. GOLDEN WEDDING. 265 The Bishop's birthplace was near Edinburgh, Scotland. He was born February 5, 1849. When he was a lad of six years, his family moved to Rhode Island, saved up enough money to cross the plains, and arrived here in 1860. The 70-year-old financier and churchman today speaks smilingly of his boyhood here in Utah, when he gleaned wheat, and herded sheep. He tells of the days, too, when Mrs. Nibley dug segos on the hills, the bulbs being a considerable part of the pioneer food of those days. Two weeks after their marriage the young couple moved to Brigham City, where Bishop Nibley was in partnership in the mercantile business with M. D. Rosenbaum, Mrs. Nibley's brother-in-law. The following autumn Mr. Nibley went on a mission to the Eastern States. On his return, he was for a time station agent on the Central Pacific railroad and the young couple, with their baby, lived down on the railroad track alone for some time. When the Utah Northern was built, Mr. Nibley was appointed general ticket and freight agent at Logan. They lived there for 22 years and there most of their children were born. In 1877, Elder Nibley was called on a mission to accompany the late President Joseph F. Smith to Europe. He labored in the business department of the European mission for two years, and returned home in 1879. Later, the family moved to Baker City, Oregon, where Mr. Nibley engaged in the lumber business, and where they lived for 11 years. They have had ten children, four daughters and six sons, seven of whom are living. The couple celebrated their silver wedding in Baker City and invitations were sent out to many friends who were present 25 years ago. Since 1903 Bishop and Mrs. Nibley have made their home in this city. In 1907 the Bishop was appointed to his present office in the Church and in the same year Mrs. Nibley was made a member of the General Board of the Relief Society. One regret in connection with the present anniversary, expressed by both the Bishop and his wife, was that their close friend, the late President Joseph F. Smith, could not be present. Mrs. Rebecca N. Nibley has been a member of our General Board for twelve years, and has taken an active interest in the work of the Society, especially along practical lines. She has been a member of the Relief Society Magazine committee from its organization, and is Chairman of the Relief Society Home committee. She has successfully administered the financial affairs of the Home, keeping the place out of debt, and making it a haven of refuge for those who are sheltered there. She is invincible in testimony, quick in responsive loyalty to our leaders, and full of quiet generosity and sympathy to all her many friends and associates. This Church has been blessed with many great and wise leaders who have stood as pillars of strength to the people of God. Few have equalled, none have surpassed Bishop Nibley in integrity, sagacity and breadth of vision. He stands today as a mighty bulwark of strength and inspired leadership in his strenuous and important position as Presiding Bishop of the Church. His quick apperception of spiritual changes, his masterly yet simply expressed loyalty and devotion to our present Church leaders is both inspiring and fruitful of results. The people repose, with increasing confidence, their trust in their great financial and temporal judge in Israel, Charles W. Nibley. He is one of the most important figures in business and financial circles of the inter-mountain west. And besides his host of friends in Utah, many prominent citizens over the entire western section of the country extended hearty congratulations to him and Mrs. Nibley on their golden wedding anniversary. Lines for a Golden Wedding Day. Written for Bishop and Mrs. C. W. Nibley. In harbored bay, with wavelets softly rolling, Their boat rides out with bells all gayly tolling. Two sit beneath a sail of pure and snowy hue, And watch the sunrise in the distant, eastern blue. A restless sea, with dashing waves athwart the bow, Their ship rides heavily with children's boats in tow. She comes to harbor on their silver wedding day, That friends may come aboard to speed them on their way. Storms well weathered, life's story nearly told, The sails and decks a-shining in sunset's fairy gold — The ship weighs anchor, while her bells are ringing A golden wedding message — old friends are happy wishes bringing. O ships, that sail life's stormy, billowing crest, How like the lives of those who drift upon your breast; How few to anchor come on golden wedding day, How many know but sorrow's bitter, blighting way! Yet fewer still may ride prosperity's wide waves — And keep life's pilot's facing the Master's Light which saves. Protect our vessels, Lord of Light, upon life's stormy sea, And bring our convoys home to harbor close near Thee. Mary Foster Gibbs.
