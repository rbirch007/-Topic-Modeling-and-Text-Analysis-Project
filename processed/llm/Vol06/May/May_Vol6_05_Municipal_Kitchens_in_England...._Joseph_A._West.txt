Municipal Kitchens in England.... Joseph A. West

Municipal Kitchens in England During the War. By Joseph A. West. The following article was sent through the courtesy of Elder George F. Richards, of the Council of the Twelve, from Liverpool, in response to my request. It will doubtless be of interest to your readers, especially that portion which speaks of the economical features of the Community Kitchen. Of course, we do not know how the prices will compare with ours here. Had we a careful record of the community kitchens and dining rooms kept by the several United Order communities which were established in different parts of Utah, under the presidency of Brigham Young, doubtless the favorable economic and other results of such movements right here among us would be equally apparent. Some twelve or fifteen years after the Prophet Joseph Smith received that remarkable revelation upon the Order of Enoch, certain leading and influential men, and men of letters, too, including Horace Greeley, editor of the New York Tribune; Charles A. Dana, editor and owner of the New York Sun; Nathaniel Hawthorne; Park Goodwin, of the New York Evening Post, and son-in-law of William Cullen Bryant; George Ripley, John S. Dwight, William Henry Channing, T. A. Whitney, and Albert Brisbane, noted editor and publisher of his time, succeeded, by extensive lecture tours throughout the East, in establishing what is known as Fourierism in the United States, numerous societies being established in Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan. On the 4th of April, 1844, a national convention was held at Clinton Hall, New York, at which George Ripley was chosen president, and among the vice-presidents were such men as Horace Greeley, Albert Brisbane, Park Goodwin and Charles A. Dana. The movement, which was but one of some fifteen others of like purpose, but different in some features of their organization, established what was known as the North American Phalanx of Fourierism in Monmouth county, New Jersey. A large tract of land was purchased, on which was erected a spacious three-story mansion for housing all the members of the Phalanx, who worked in the various industries of the organization, but who were mainly horticulturists and agriculturists. All lived under one roof, and ate in the same dining room. The cost of meals which were served a la carte, (this was in 1850) was remarkably small, coffee being but one-half cent per cup, including milk; butter, half a cent; meat, two cents, and other dishes in proportion; but in addition to this, each member paid 36½ cents per week for the dining room and his proportion of waiter service and lights. The rent of a good sized room in the mansion was $12 per year. (See Hillquit's History of Socialism in America.) All this is another evidence of what may be saved to any community that can successfully adopt such measures of economic living. The Phalanx, above referred to, numbering several hundred people ceased to exist after a few years, as they lacked the influence of true Christianity to cement and beautify their community life. The following are extracts from Mr. Forshaw's address on "Municipal Kitchens," in England, and their use during the war: Address on "Municipal Kitchens" and Their Use During the Scarcity of Food. By Mr. H. Forshaw. As you are all aware, the present crisis through which the World is passing has compelled men and women everywhere to consider new subjects and adjust their views regarding old ones. Our municipalities organized National Kitchens rather from expediency, owing to conditions arising out of the War, than from economic principles. Contrary to all experience and expectations, during this war traders have generally been experiencing an unprecedented time of prosperity, and so have a large number of wage-earners; but nevertheless, unorganized labor has received little or no increase in wages. Those who have received a large increase in wages are able to satisfy their wants and buy goods unthought of in ordinary times and also to meet the enhanced prices charged, while those who have received little or no advance are the worst sufferers. Of course, it is well known that the art of good government is to keep people contented and give them no cause for grievance. The vulgar display of dress, seen in our streets, cannot but create a spirit of discontent amongst those who cannot get enough to keep body and soul together. With a view to meeting the wants of the working-people the Liverpool Corporation are attempting to carry out the principle of Municipal Kitchens. You all know what co-operation is, then what objection can there be to Co-operative Cooking? As is well known in all enterprises the greater the output or turnover the more economically can any enterprise be worked. This is naturally so in the case of Municipal Kitchens and the cost of providing for 5,000 or 6,000 persons is much cheaper per head than for a family of six, the saving thus affected can be utilized in reducing the price of food. What 100 housewives will have to pay in bulk for say £20, the Manager of the Kitchens would pay about £9 — this is no fallacy but a fact. Much food is lost by bad or indifferent cooking, and these kitchens will set a new example in the preparation and use of food, and so educate the tastes of people. Briefly it may be said that the main objects of the Kitchens are to save food, fuel, worry, labor and to enable persons who cannot cook at home to obtain nourishing food whether hot or cold. These kitchens are not run for profit but aim merely to clear expenses. Consider the amount of money saved in fuel. For instance, instead of 100 fires going to cook (well or badly) 100 meals in 100 kitchens, we have one large fire, or stove, at a Municipal Kitchen which will cook the whole of the 100 meals with ease. The day may come, when Municipal Cooking may become an absolute necessity, in order to properly feed our dear young children and the aged and infirm who cannot look after themselves. It may be of interest to know that Kitchens were started in London at the East End by two missionaries about 30 years ago. Messrs. Gregory and Chudleigh, who started a Soup Kitchen in one of the worst parts of the East End. In Holland they have a kitchen in each street. The success of these endeavors, coupled with other individual efforts, no doubt influenced our British Food Controller to suggest the idea that Municipalities should provide and equip Municipal Kitchens in the interests of National Food Economy. To many of the patrons the valuable properties and even the taste of vegetables are unknown. Few will care to return to poorer and more expensive habits after experiencing the advantages of variety in food and better methods of cooking. It is a very common thing for a whole family to be supplied with dinners from our Kitchens, and it cannot be too strongly pointed out that the Kitchens are not open for the poorest of the poor only, but for any class of the community who wish to avail themselves of the facilities afforded for the obtaining of good cooked food at reasonable prices. This is a great boon to mothers who have been compelled to go out to work to supplement the income of the home and also to provide children with a good wholesome meal at the period of their lives when it is most needed. Of course these Kitchens are never intended to harass existing traders, but to help people to obtain a decent meal during the present strain and stress of the times. For your information we have now in Liverpool 10 Municipal Kitchens and these are in such places as Scotland Road, Old Swan, Kirkdale Road, Earle Road, Netherfield Road, Park Road, etc. Owing to the difficult times and scarcity of foodstuffs every effort is made to vary the kinds of foods supplied, the dishes being changed as often as possible. The following is a menu: Menu. Hot Water ½d. Porridge 1½d. Cocoa 1d. Irish Stew 4d. Hot Pot 4d. War Stew 3d. and 4d. Municipal Pie and Gravy 3d. Roast Beef 4d. And Potatoes Boiled, Jacket, Baked or Roasted. Puddings 1½d. and 2d. Soups 1½d. The other day I saw a queue waiting outside a butcher's shop numbering about 200. These people were all waiting in the rain to purchase meat, and from what I could see the butcher had in his shop sufficient to supply each person with about 4 ounces. Only a few doors away, the people could have obtained meat at our Kitchen, ready cooked, which would have been sold at probably a less price than they would pay the butcher for the same meat, and then it would not be cooked. Passing along the same quarter on the first day of the week, I saw a queue of practically the same women waiting outside a pawnshop. This war is teaching us that if human beings are to work at their best, their mental and physical conditions must be as good as possible. Miserable dwelling places, foul air, long hours of labor, labor made harder than is necessary, defeat their objects both in the world of industry and in the universal industry of keeping house, bearing and rearing children. The Municipal Kitchen is an institution which should bear no relationship at all to the charity soup kitchen. As an illustration of the war Meat Rationing Order, note the following: One meat coupon from a Meat Card will ensure a meat meal for four days in the week. This meal would consist of say, Stewed or Roast Heart, Kidney or Ox Cheeks, Liver or Tripe, to the amount of nearly two ounces in each meal. A half of a coupon will ensure a cut from a joint either roast beef or mutton or stewed steak with onions or carrots and covered with nice hot gravy. Three whole coupons if left at one of the Kitchens will ensure a Meat Meal for the whole of the week including a portion to be used for the Sunday. All the Kitchens are registered by the Food Controller, and the supplies are rationed out. There's an idea in some quarters to the effect that Municipal Kitchens are all right in their way, but certain people cannot quite fancy the food cooked therein. In this connection it is interesting for me to be able to state that food cooked at one of the Kitchens, is at present and has been for some time past, supplied to a certain Club in Liverpool, and the food has been commented upon in laudatory terms by the patrons who to this day are absolutely in ignorance as to where the food comes from. The Committee of the Club have expressed the wish that the walls of the Club were made of rubber so that they could stretch or enlarge the premises when occasion requires owing to the large and sudden increase in the memberships. We are also supplying dinners to the Walker Art Gallery for the staff working on Food Control, at a cost of 7½d. I may mention that a movement is on foot to start a National Restaurant where a meal can be bought for 8d. including a pudding. The whole movement is of course only in its infancy. H. FORSHAW, Director of Food Kitchen During the Great War. Dear Mr. Richards: Herewith please find a copy of an address delivered to the Co-operation Society during the worst part of the war when food was very uncertain. I may state that in the north of England these kitchens have not proved the success that we anticipated, but I firmly believe that a kitchen or restaurant is necessary in every large district. I will be glad to give you any further particulars necessary. You have only to ask. Yours truly, H. FORSHAW. RESIGNATION OF HEAD OF REORGANITE CHURCH. The surprising news that the grandson of the Prophet Joseph Smith, Frederick M. Smith, had tendered his resignation as the President of the Reorganite Church, because of disagreement with his Twelve Apostles, is reported from Lamoni, Iowa, April 10. Later information states that the trouble had been adjusted and that the president will continue in office. The difficulty arose over whether the Twelve or the President should direct the 300 missionaries of the organization. A
