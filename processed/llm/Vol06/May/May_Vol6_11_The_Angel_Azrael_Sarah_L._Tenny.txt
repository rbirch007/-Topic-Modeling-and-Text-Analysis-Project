The Angel Azrael Sarah L. Tenny
======================================================================

Angel Azrael. By Sarah L. Tenny. There was silence throughout heaven; hushed were the golden strings; And cherubim and seraphim bowed low with folded wings. The eternal One had spoken, like.diapasons swell, Yet in accents deep and tender rose the summons, "Azrael!" Lo! one.stood forth whose brightness outshone the myriad throng; His wings of dazzling whiteness, his mein, majestic, strong, A glittering spear he carried, as reverently he moved, Fairest of all God's angels, of all God's most beloved. "Azrael!" Lowly bending, he knelt before the throne; Humility "still lending new charms unto his own. "Azrael! from my children on earth, come cries of woe, I hear and fain would help them, thither, my angel, go. "In pain and grief some languish, sighing to be set free. And some in mortal anguish struggling for liberty. Go, Azrael, release them from their prison house of clay, And bring my children home to me, in my paradise this day." Down through the boundless ether the swift-winged angel flew. Past upper world and nether, till unto the earth he drew; Entered the chamber's portal, where the weary sufferers lay, Released their souls immortal, and bore them hence away. On earth were.sounds of weeping, and funeral bells were tolled; But there was rapturous greetings, in the city paved with gold, Hosannas filled all heaven; unto him upon the throne, As the angel who was bidden, brought back to God his own. "Well done, my faithful angel!" Thus the Almighty One; "And welcome, done! earth-born children, your life work, too, is well But thou art sad, oh Azrael, and sorrow dims thine eye. Thy radiant wings are drooping, tell me, my angel, why?" "O thou, whose matchless glory fills earth and sky and sea, Who art from everlasting, and to the end shall be — Joyful I heard thy summons and hastened to fulfill. Glad to be counted worthy to do my Maker's will. 286 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. "I thought I should be welcome, since I came to set men free From their chains of earthly thralldom, but they looked with fear on me, And everywhere they saw me, men spoke with bated breath, They turned away and shuddered and whispering called me Death. "They know not it is life's sweet life the angel Azrael brings; And thus it is my spirit grieves and therefore droop my wings, And now, O loving Father, bend low thy gracious ear. And in thy tender mercy; grant Azrael this his prayer: "Lift but for one brief moment, the shadowy, mystic veil, That hides earth's children from their loved and lost ones they bewail, And never more, kind Father, shall they look on me with fear, Or bow their heads in anguish when Azrael draws near." "Rise, Azrael, beloved, I may not grant thy plea; These earthly children of my care, must learn to trust in me; I have told them of my heaven and many mansions fair. My Son, the crucified, I've given, that they may enter there. "But if a moment only, it were permitted them; To gaze with earthly vision on the new Jerusalem — Her princely towers and turrets, her glory all untold. The rapture of the shining ones, who walk her streets of gold — "Think you they would be fitted, for the victory they must win. Ere they can hear the welcome, 'Good and faithful, enter in?' Their efiforts would be palsied with longing to be there; Nay, Azrael, it were not kind to hearken to thy prayer. "But this I grant thee, angel, from henceforward it shall be. When thou dost go to earth to set a spirit free. Unto the hearts left desolate, this message thou shalt tell; Mourn not thy loved ones, for with them it is and shall be well!" And so, whene'er the,sorrow of the Angel's drooping wing Falls on our hearthstone, and we sit speechless in suffering, Rising o'er all our anguish, deeper than hope's deep knell. We hear the angel whisper, "with thy loved ones it is well." Oh, sweet and blest assurance, it soothes our nameless dread, And though Rachel still be weeping, her heart is comforted, Beloved, let us fear not, knowing it shall be well When comes for us God's angel, the white-winged Azrael! — Boston Evening Transcript.
