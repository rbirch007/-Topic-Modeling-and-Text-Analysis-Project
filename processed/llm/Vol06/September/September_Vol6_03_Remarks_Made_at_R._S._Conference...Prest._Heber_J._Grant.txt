Remarks Made at R. S. Conference...Prest. Heber J. Grant

Remarks Made at the Relief Society General Conference. June 3, 1919 President Heber J. Grant. I am delighted with the opportunity of meeting the sisters this afternoon. I listened with very great pleasure to the fine address by Elder Anthony W. Ivins, and I know you must have enjoyed very much the privilege of hearing him speak. As strange as it may seem to you, while I have heard Elder Ivins speak many times on the Book of Mormon, and am familiar with the Book of Mormon, I have never had that opportunity before.

Occasionally I have found many evidences, independent of the testimony I possess of the divinity of the work, that have confirmed my faith in the Book of Mormon. As an illustration, when I reached London, after being appointed President of the European mission, I presented a letter 500 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. of introduction to the general manager of the New York Life Insurance Co., at that time a corporation with assets of four or five hundred million dollars. They have passed the billion dollar mark now. (To give you an idea of what a billion dollars means; a billion dollars amounts to one dollar a minute from the birth of Christ to the present time.) The letter that I presented was from a former
