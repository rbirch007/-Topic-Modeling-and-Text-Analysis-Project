The Garden in September
======================================================================

Garden in September. Autumn Beauty. "There is a beauty in the autumn time Which spring hath not with all her greenery And wealth of opening buds on shrub and tree, Autumn hath tints and hues a thousand fold More beautiful and lovely to the eye, Nor spring nor summer with her charms can vie. They are to her as silver is to gold. Garlands of berries with deft skill she weaves And paints with perfect touch the dying leaves." John Askham. The month of September is the best time of all the year to "houseclean" your flower garden. Then you can rectify mistakes in arrangement of your flower beds, errors you did not realize until actual blooming time. When a row of brilliant scarlet poppies or geraniums is in flower close to a bed of magenta or purple petunias, then one realizes the need of careful planning to ensure color harmony. Only by constant shifting and rearrangement can we come nearer an ever growing ideal of garden perfection. As time goes on your plants will inevitably gravitate to their own appropriate surroundings. Seeds of all hardy perennials should be sown in September, for it is the autumn sown seed that will give the sturdiest plants, and, if given some light protection of stable litter, tops of plants, or leaves, will attend to their own business of cheerful existence during the winter snows, and will bloom in the early spring. A border of hardy perennials once begun, will continue itself indefinitely by self seeding and root doubling. Plan your garden so that you can have a succession of bloom during nine months of the year. Perennials need rich homes, as they usually stay a long time in one spot, so give the greatest and best chance for the deep digging, and fertilization before they are planted. Climbing and Rambler Roses should be pruned severely, it is important to cut away all the old wood; this often means taking away over half the vine, but one is quickly repaid by the new growth which immediately shoots up from the roots, more than taking the place of all removed. It is on these new THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER. 529 branches that the next season's growth will appear. The cuttings may be planted on a ditch bank or moist place and many of them will take root and may be transplanted in spring or a long branch of the vine may be bent down carefully to the ground and covered with a few inches of soil (which should be well tamped down) leaving the end of the branch free. In spring it may be severed with a sharp knife from the parent tree, and removed to other quarters. Lily bulbs which are fall planted do better and bloom more freely than those planted in spring. The September garden is a vision of beauty, the dahlias reach their perfection during this month; tall African marigolds vie with four o'clocks and the multi-colored zinnia, petunias raise their sweet scented cups until overtaken by severe frost. Asters are in all their glory, and a vivid note of bright scarlet is stuck by the salvias. It is the harvest time of the garden and the wise flower lover will surely save her harvest of seed, and bulb. Whenever a flower of universal beauty of form, color or marking is formed it should be marked by tying a small piece of tape around the stem and saved for seed. New varieties are often produced in this manner. Gather enough seed of your favorite plants for your own use and to share with your friends; a packet of flower seed packed in a dainty envelope with name and directions for planting, makes a pleasing birthday remembrance, or valentine. Decorate the outside of the envelope with a sketch of the flower, done with crayon or watercolor, or an illustration may be cut from an old flower catalogue, and write a jingle like the following: Tall snapdragons, plant in rows. Colors? Carmine, pink and rose, White and yellow, orange, too, I just love them, dear, don't you? All plants that are being grown for the window garden this month should be given an occasional dose of weak liquid manure, and transplanted into larger pots when necessary. Save cuttings of your choice petunias and snapdragons, these may be wintered in a warm basement window or any frost-proof place. Bulbs of buttercup oxalis, freesia, callas and Easter lilies should be planted this month for winter blooming. These are received by the florist from Bermuda, and are ready for sale in August and September. Freesia's are usually planted in a shallow pot or hanging basket, five or six bulbs to a pot, they take five months to reach the blooming stage but are surely worth waiting for. THE OFFICIAL
