Construction and Reconstruction in the Home. Conducted by Jeanette A. Hyde and Lucile Y. McAllister. THE ECONOMY OF MAKING SHIRTS. Most women have an idea that a shirt is very difficult co make so that it will be satisfactory to men who have become accustomed to the boughten shirts. If you are accurate in your measurements and can stitch a straight seam on the machine, there is no reason why you cannot save half the cost of your husband's or son's shirts by making them at home. I have proved that with three yards of fifty-cent material a shirt can be made that cannot be bought for less than three dollars in the clothing stores. Of course, one must be governed by circumstances, but the finer the grade of material used the greater the economy in making the shirt. During the early part of the summer I priced a silk broadclot.shirt at eighteen dollarsIn the stores I found the.same silk for three dollars a yard so that one could duplicate this shirt for nine dollars. Just a word in passing on the economy of the silk shirt. Many men consider them an extravagance, but they are not. The first cost is high but the length of time they may be worn brings them down to only an ordinary price. Selecting the Material. This is largely a matter of taste but it is generally conceded that there is no pattern so satisfactory as the stripe for a man's shirt. They are neat looking and blend well into the general tailored effect of men's clothing. Plain material, especially in white, tan and light blue, are very good. Shirting, ginghams of good quality, percales and batistes are most satisfactory in the cottons. Tub silk, pongee, heavy crepe de shine and regular silk shirtings are best in the silks. Material to he Used. Three yard,s of material one yard wide. Seven small pearl buttons. One collar band of the size desired and thread. The poller bands may be purchased all ready to set on the shirt.

I have found the sizes in these collar bands to be accurate and may be used on the very best of shirts with perfect satisfaction. The pattern. It is better to take an old srirt which has been worn and which fits well, wash it, pick it apart, and then iron the pieces very carefully. It is necessary- to allow from three-eights to onehalf an inch from the old material. This will give you ample material to make accurate seams. I do not mean to infer that the boughten shirt patterns are not good, but I have seen many women have trouble with the pattern. Cutting. Place the pieces of the shirt on the material as suggested by the drawing and see that your scissors are sharp enough to cut a perfectly straight edge on the pieces. This will go a long way toward making the seams easy to do. It is necessary to cut an inter lining of thin white material (long cloth or similar material) for the cuffs and yoke. Method of procedure. It is difficult to describe in detail all the different parts and how they should be finished, but you will find the shirt you have picked to pieces for a pattern a great help in the finishing. The following order of working at the different parts will be helpful: 1. Finish the opening in the sleeve. I like to do this by using one facing piece (cut about two and a-half inches wide) long enough to go from the bottom of the sleeve to the top of the opening and back to the bottom of the sleeve. Set it on like you would a braid having the last stitching on the right sideStitch the outside edge. Then turn the facing back inside the sleeve in the positions it will be when the cuff is put on and stitch the top of the opening as in Figure 11. 2. Sew the back of the shirt to the yoke, being careful to get the fulness over the proper place. The interlining should be hasted to the under side of the yoke, leaving the single thickness for the top. The stitching on the right side may be double if desired. 3.- Next sew the front shoulder seams to the yoke in the same manner. Do this just as you would the shoulder of a waist by placing the material even in the neck and letting any unevenness come out in the arm-eye. 4. Now carefully measure or baste your neck band in place all but about two and one-half inches from each end. Then finish the fronts. This will save you any fulness in the neck which CONSTRUCTION AND RECONSTRUCTION. 541 is the worst fault a shirt can have and if you have been careful in your cutting you will be safe in doing this. 5- Finish basting on the neck band and stitch by machine. 6. Set the.sleeve in with a flat fell seam with the last stitching on the right side. 7. Hem the two fronts and back across the bottom and up the sides as far as it is hemmed on the shirt you have used as a pattern. 8. Next sew the seam from the bottom of the sleeve to the arm-eye and from the arm-eye to where the corners begin to round. A French seam is better here than a flat fell. 9. Sew the cuffs up on the wrong side, turn and sew on to the bottom of the sleeve. Practically all cuffs are double stitched and this should be done on the right side after the cuff has been sewed in place. 10. The button and button holes. If you do not desire to work these yourself you may have them made by machine for a very small cost. DREAM PICTURES. Where sunshine chases shadows And birds come home to sing, Upon a fallen tree-trunk Beside a crystal spring Who.se mirrored depths reflected The scenes of vale and tree Is where I dream the pictures Dear Love, of you and meWe sit beside each other And watch the pool below To see two forms reflected. But well, my Love, we know. That soon this happy moment Which we have now begun. Will paint another picture, And there will be but one. General D. A. Utter. Mountainhome, Idaho. ON THE
