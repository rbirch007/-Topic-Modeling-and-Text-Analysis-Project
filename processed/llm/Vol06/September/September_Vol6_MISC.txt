inspired prayer of Elder Orson Hyde be both prophecy and prayer. And as we anticipate this event do we not again see God moving in a mysterious way his wonders to perform? It is said that fifty years ago the Emperor of Japan took for his slogan, "Japan shall know everything that is known by any other nation in the world." All well informed people know that Japan absorbed that slogan. She is one of the most advanced nations in the world today. And there is little that any other nation knows which Japan through her diligence has not acquired. So likewise have the Jews absorbed the learning of the world. Palestine will realize as her children gather to rebuild, that they have brought knowledge from every clime where they have been scattered. What does Great Britain know that the Jew of the British Isles has not learned? What have France, Spain and Italy to give the world that a Jew or group of Jews have not absorbed? Have Russia, Austria or Poland any strong national characteristic or gift that do not reflect themselves in the achievements of their Jewish subjects? America, boasting of inventive genius and business insight, has many able representatives of her business ability among her Jewish citizens. Like Shakespeare's Shylock they have learned all things that their gentile neighbors know, but they will know even more than their instructors. Shylock said, "the villainy you teach me will I practice, but I will better my instruction." It is to be hoped that in the rebuilding of Palestine those sons and daughters of the ancient Hebrews will practice only the good they have learned from their gentile brethren, bettering it with all the power God shall add unto them. And are we not on the very threshold of the fulfilment of 550 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. great and mighty prophecy, prophecy uttered many centuries before the advent of Christ in the land of Jewish nativity, and again reiterated on this continent by Lehi and Nephi? Truly God doth nothing unless he reveals it to his servants the prophets, and truly were Lehi and Nephi inspired of Almighty God, for the prophecies they utter fail not. QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS. 1. Discuss the proposition: We are living in a day of fulfilment, and tell of the culmination of some things not mentioned in the lesson. 2. Read in class Elder Orson Hyde's prayer offered on the Mount of Olives. 3. Show how it is both prayer and prophecy. 4. Give instances of Latter-day Zion being built up by persons gathering from many foreign climes. 5. Find out if you can who did the cabinet work on the tabernacle organ in Salt Lake City. From what country did he come? Who built the organ? Musical part? From what country did he come? 6. From what country did Karl G. Maeser come? 7. In what land was John Hafen, the painter, born? 8. What might British Jews contribute to the building up of Palestine? 9. What might Italian Jews contribute? 10. What might Jews from the United States of America contribute? LESSON II. Work and Business. Second Week in October. LESSON III. Genealogy. Third Week in October. FRENCH SURNAMES. The history of France. The Catholic Church as a source of surnames. The Crusaders. Not until after Caesar's time do we know anything about that rich country, which is called France. A people known as Gauls, GUIDE LESSONS. 551 who were of Celtic race, then inhabited all the district north of the Alps and west of the Rhine. When the apostate Catholic religion became popular in the fourth century the priests began a system of recording vital statistics, but these records are hidden behind locked doors in the Vatican in Rome. When the Crusaders went to Palestine in the sixteenth century the custom of surnaming people became very popular; and later the government made the custom a part of the law of France. The evolution of French surnames followed the usual course. By Luther's time, 1517, there was a pretty well established method of surnaming the French people. Like all other European nations this custom began with the titled people and the aristocratic classes. The trades unions next made it popular for artisans to adopt surnames and then the military men were obliged to adopt them because of the necessity of keeping track of the many soldiers who made up such a large part of the French population for centuries. The government itself finally took a strong hand in this matter and various laws have been passed concerning the registers of both the church and the state, which now preserve the vital statistics of this country. Unlike most other European nations the French government passed a law two centuries ago which made it unlawful for people to name their children even with Christian names unless chosen from a list issued by the state. The sources and divisions of surnames follow the same general outline found in other European countries. First we have the Patronymic, or father's name. These are the most numerous with their associated nicknames. We have for instance, Henry, Jacques, Robert, Guillaume, Michel, Paul, Pierre, Renaud, Richard and Simon. Place names come next in point of evolution and frequency. De La (of the) and Du have been tacked on to every conceivable variation and estate. De la Fontaine, Daix (for d'Aix) Danjou (for d'Anjou), Descamps, Duval, De la Motte, and Chateaubriand, etc. Trade names are equally familiar and frequent, cuisinier (cook), Boulanger (baker), Roulier (teamster), Le Feuvre (blacksmith), Lemaistre, Le Meunier (the miller), Escuyer (followed his master to war to care for his horse), Granger (tenant of a "grange" or farm), Charpentier (carpenter), Charbonnier (charcoal maker), Fournier (tender of the "fournier" or baking oven used in common by a village), Berger (shepherd), Botteron, Celier, Cuvier (maker of "cuves," wooden vessel to wash in), Sellier, (bootmaker), Bossard (maker of clothes brushes, etc.) Titles sometimes furnish surnames, for instance: Chevalier 552 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. (knight), Lecomte (count), Duc, Prince, Roy (King), Seigneur (Lord), Cur? (Priest), etc. Nicknames were given as in other countries very frequently. Descriptive names also were used by the French people. Colors, size and conditions helped to determine what nickname should continue. There are many French names among the Huguenot refugees who settled in England and later in America and some of these are very familiar even here in Utah. We might illustrate these Huguenot names as follows: There are such names as Lambert, Godfrey, Gilbert, Gervase, Michael, Martin, Roger, Charles and the like that would become English at once without alteration. But there are others with which we are familiar: Percy occurs repeatedly. Roussel, Dherby, an immigrant in 1684, would drop the "h" and become Derby. There are several Smiths in the lists, presumably arriving from the Netherlands. The old Norse name of Houssaye comes in several times; so do Hardy, More, Hayes, Rose, Mercer, Marchant, Mourtis, Car, Emery, Nisbet, Neel, Ogelby, Boyd, Blondell, Cooke, Pratt, Lee, King, Johnson, Stockey, Davies, Best, Kemp, Wilkins, Pryor, Fox, Hudson (soon to shed the "h"), White, Bush, Greenwood, etc. Langue would speedily become Lang, and Boreau become Borough; Grangier be converted into Granger, and Goudron into Gordon; Guillard would become Gillard, and Blond be written and pronounced Blunt. How some of the names given above that seem to be distinctly English such as Greenwood and Highstreet, come into the Huguenot lists is puzzling; and we can only suppose that the immigrants translated their French names into the corresponding English, as Boisvert into Greenwood, and Hauterue into Highstreet. QUESTIONS. Who were the Gauls? What were the original boundaries of Gaul? Of France? Who was Charlemagne? What customs of surnaming were followed in France? Give illustrations. Note: The Genealogical Stake and Ward Committee are requested to finish up all family surname cards and return to Genealogical Society of Utah. Where cards are needed send to the Genealogical Society of Utah, who will furnish them free. GUIDE LESSONS. 553 LESSON 4. Home Courses. Fourth Week in October. PLANNING MEALS FOR THE FAMILY In our present day manner of living, in the family group, a large share of the proper feeding of the race and therefore of the development and maintenance of physically strong men and women, is a problem of the home, more particularly a big problem for the housewife who is responsible for the meals set before the family. This big problem is moreover a difficult one, first, because there is such a confusing abundance, a bewildering maze of food materials from which must be chosen just those articles that are best adapted to the needs of the several members of the family; second, because appetite alone is not a dependable guide in the matter of eating. That the appetite cannot be trusted alone, is evidenced by the many examples not only of indulgence in alcoholic beverages, but also in food excesses such as of sugar or meat, and in the frequent cases of individuals liking too small a number of food articles or disliking those that should be staples. Yet the problem of good meals for the family must be solved. Now, the greater assurance that the family meals will meet the needs of the individual members, follows only when the housewife keeps constantly in mind, first, what food is, and second, that the primary function of food is to meet the body needs rather than to satisfy cultivated tastes. It is only under such circumstances that she can be sure that at least each day's food and if possible each meal supplies the materials necessary to meet these three constant needs of the body, viz., first, energy; second, tissue building material; third, regulation of body processes. The most generally accepted definition of food is: "Food is anything which when taken into the body will yield energy, or build tissue, or regulate body processes." Foods as we eat them ? apples, milk, eggs, meat etc., are made up of certain substances we call "nutrients." In all the great variety of foods we eat there are only six of these so-called "nutrients." By name these nutrients are: carbohydrates, that is all forms of starches and sugars; protein; fat; water; minerals; and vitamins. Minerals are sometimes called ash because they are left unconsumed when foods are burned. Eight minerals are needed in the body; these are ? iron, sulphur, phosphorus, calcium or lime, sodium, chloride, magnesium, potassium. Vitamins have been discovered in food only in the last few years and we know very little about them other than that they are necessary for life and growth of the young and for the health of the adult person as well as of the child. It is just 554 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. as desirable and important that the woman who plans meals for herself or others become familiar with these nutrients and their uses in the human body, as it is that the seamstress know what hems, gathers, belts, plackets, seams, are in a garment and what purposes they serve. Group 1? Foods Good for Protein. Cheese, cream or cottage; Lean meat of all kinds, beef, pork, fish, poultry mutton; Milk, whole, skim and buttermilk; Eggs; Legumes, peas, beans of all kinds, lentils, peanuts, soybeans; Cereals (give a moderate amount) Group 2? Foods Good for Fat. Olive oil; Mazola, and other salad oils; Cooking fats, as lard, crisco, etc. Butter and oleomargarine; Fat meats; Egg-yolk; Nuts, most kinds; Group 3 ? Foods Good for Carbohydrates. (a) Starches Cereals, wheat, corn, oats, rice, rye, barley, buckwheat; and all preparations made from cereals, as flours, meals, grits, starches, macaroni, spaghetti, vermicelli, crackers, breakfast foods, bread, cakes, cookies, noodles, Starchy vegetables, as potatoes, sweet potatoes, squash, pumpkin, carrots, parsnips; Bananas, Ripe beans of all kinds, lentils, and peanuts. (b) Sugars Granulated, brown, loaf, or powdered sugar; Honey; Molasses, syrups of all kinds; Fruits canned, dried, jams, jellies, and fruit butters; Milk. Group 4? Foods Good for Minerals. Milk; Egg-yolk; All vegetables and fruits, especially spinach, lettuce, carrots, peas, cabbage, celery, apples, oranges, berries, pineapple, grapes; Bran of cereals, for example, in graham flour, rolled oats, cracked hominy, bran biscuit or pudding. GUIDE LESSONS. 555 Group 5 ? Foods Good for Vitamins. (a) Milk, and milk products, especially butter, cream, and whole milk cheese; Meat (a small amount) ; Eggs; Greens of all kinds; (b) Vegetables of all kinds; Fruits all kinds; Note. ? The vitamins found in foods under (a) occur in a smaller number of foods than in case of (b), so more care must be taken that foods in the (a) part of Group 5 are used sufficiently. Notice that milk is placed in each of the five groups. Eggs are at once an excellent source of protein, fat, minerals, and vitamins, if the whole egg or the yolk alone be used. Vegetables and fruits are valuable for minerals, carbohydrates and vitamins. Cereals furnish an abundance of carbohydrates in the form of starch, a moderate amount of protein, and if the bran is contained in the cereal preparation, minerals are also supplied. Since it requires all six of the nutrients to meet the three body needs, it is imperative that each day's meals include at least one representative from each of the above five groups, as well as water. Water should be used freely, adults taking about three quarts in twenty-four hours. It may be drunk at meals as well as between meals if it is not taken to soften the food. To take water into the mouth while food is in it, is at once bad physiology and bad manners. In the adult's diet special thought must be given to the use of fresh fruits and vegetables and top milk. No day should be allowed to pass without vegetables and fruits having been served. One pint of milk for each adult per day is a good allowance. If fresh milk cannot be procured then condensed or powdered milk is a desirable substitute for the fresh product. Some people cannot take milk, unless in cooked form. *** ***** That it is imperative to use in each day's meals, and in each meal if possible at least one representative of each group of foods as given above, is shown by an examination of the three body needs, and noting the nutrients required in each case. (Note. ? T means 1 level tablespoon; c means 1 level cup of ? pint size; t means teaspoon.) Sugar, 2 T; Corn starch, 3 T; White bread, 1 slice, size ? inch X 3? in. x 3? in. ; Cornflakes, 1? c; Grapenuts, 3 T; Shredded wheat, 1 biscuit; Rice, 2 T raw, ? c cooked; Cream of wheat, 2? T raw, ? c cooked; Rolled oats, 3? T raw, ? c cooked; Potato, 1 medium; Whole milk, ? c; Skim milk, 1 c: Cauliflower, 1 small head; Spinach, 14 ounces or ? gal. raw, Lima beans, 2? T cooked; Peanuts, 12 or 16 kernels; Almonds, 12 kernels; Apple, 1 large; Banana, 1 medium; Orange, 1 large; Raisins, 1? T, seeded; Dates without stones, 5 to 7; Whole egg, medium 1?; Cheese, 1 cu. inch; Butter, 1 T 556 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. Scientific experiment has also worked out with considerable accuracy the number of calories required by persons of different ages as well as of adults doing muscular work of different degrees of severity. The following tables* summarize the generally accepted figures: Age Calories per Lb. Calories per Day Under 1 year 45 1 to 2 years 45 to 40 1000 to 1200 2 to 5 years 40 to 36 1200 to 1500 6 to 9 years 36 to 32 1400 to 2000 10 to 13 years 34 to 27 1800 to 2400 for girls 2300 to 3000 for boys 14 to 17 years 30 to 22 2200 to 2600 for girls 2800 to 4000 for boys Requirements for the man of average size (weighing about 150 lbs.), doing a moderate amount of work (for example a carpenter's work), have been calculated as follows:* Eight hours of sleep at 65 calories 520 calories Two hours' light exercise (walking) at 170 calories 340 " Eight hours' carpenter's work at 240 calories 1,920 " Six hours' sitting at rest at 100 calories 600 " Total food requirement for the day 3,380 calories one-third we may safely count on coming from the bread, cereals, and vegetables that we should have in this daily diet. The regulation of body processes is effected together by water, minerals and vitamins. All these nutrients must be constantly present in proper amounts if the heart is to beat as it should, the food be properly digested, absorbed and used in the body, the waste materials excreted, the breathing go on as it should, and all parts of the body work together in harmony. We "Chemistry of Food and Nutrition" (page 186), by Dr. H. C. Sherman. GUIDE LESSONS. 557 attempt to suggest amounts of these regulating nutrients only in the case of the water, as has been said about three quarts for a grown person per day. But we must take care that each day's food contains several articles that will furnish vitamins and minerals. Suggestions for planning adequate meals for the family may be made more concrete by the following menus: QUESTIONS TO ACCOMPANY LESSONS ON "PLANNING FOR THE FAMILY." Questions for Lesson One. 1. What are the three advantages of planning meals? 2. What are nutrients? How many are there? Name them. 3. What are the body's needs that are met by food? 4. What is the special importance of vitamins? What foods furnish vitamins? 5. What nutrients are supplied by a salad of apples, raisins and nuts, with a dressing of whipped cream? 6. What nutrients will be furnished by bread pudding, using bread, sugar, egg, milk and flavoring in its making? Questions for Lesson Two. 1. How many of the nutrients should be in each day's meals? Why? 2. What determines the amount of energy-yielding foods which a grown person needs? 3 Name six good food sources of energy. To what nutrient does each owe this power to yield energy?
4. Name six foods that will have a good share in the building of body tissues and tell what nutrient in each is good for tissue building.
5. Name six foods that will have a good share in regulating body processes and tell why each helps.

SMOKING CARS FOR WOMEN
Smoking cars for women will be run on some of the eastern roads within the next few years, New York railroad men predict. The vestibules and observation platforms on many trains running to New England during the college commencement period this year were filled to overflowing with young girls and women puffing cigarettes.
The Best Home Drink
Even a good meal is made better by the addition of a cool, invigorating beverage. You should be sure it is pure and wholesome and that it has food values. Such a drink is Nekto. It becomes a part of the meal. It contains a very large proportion of food properties and is healthful to a marked degree. That's why doctors recommend it as a food as well as a drink.
