Today Bertha A. Kleinman
======================================================================

TODAY. Bertha A. Kleinman. I cannot trace the way again That bridges o'er today, But have I gleaned the acres all That mark so short a way? I may not touch the hands again That stayed me in appeal, But have I thrilled them with the warmth That makes my own heart feel? I will not pass the spring again, Left brimming on the slope, But have I pointed thirsting lips To quaff its well of Hope? I shall not mount life's stair again, Then may I, as I climb, Reflect upon some straying step The light that beckons mine!
