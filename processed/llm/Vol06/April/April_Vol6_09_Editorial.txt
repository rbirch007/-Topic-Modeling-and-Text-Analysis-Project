Janette A. Hyde Amy Brown Lyman Room 29, WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH OUR BOYS WHO SMOKE? One of the startling and unhappy results of life in army camps is the acquirement of the smoking habit by a limited proportion of our own boys. We may try to account for this deplorable condition by referring to the weak character of the youths who thus offend; or perhaps, to the breaking of the Word of Wisdom by their parents, or to the lack of proper training and environment in their youth. It may well be that the young man's unfortunate habit was framed in the camps or fields where he had tobacco and cigarettes pushed on him by the cruel kindness of sentimental women, and even through Red Cross and Y. M. C. A. agencies to which our own people contributed liberally, little realizing the harm which would result to their own sons from the misplaced sympathy of worldly-minded people. Any or all of these causes, or none of them, may have started the youth on the wrong path, but we mothers have the situation to face, and what can we do about it? First, let us consider the problem fairly and squarely, instead of pushing it out of mind with evasive excuses for ourselves and for the young man. He has acquired a spiritual disease with a vicious physical appetite and needs curative help. If it were a bodily disease only, we would dose him up with home remedies or hurry EDITORIAL. 239 after a doctor. Yet far more dangerous to his life here and hereafter is this deadly habit, because it enslaves the will. Therefore, our first duty is to face the situation and try to remedy it. If we have broken the Word of Wisdom, if only occasionally, let us cease at once to offer this stumbling-block to our son's reform. If the young man's environment has been at fault, then let us study how to remedy the defect. And if it is a weakness in his own character, then let us add strength and faith from our own prayer-sought fountain of hope and help. Scolding, or fault-finding, is about the most deadly hindrance to the work of reformation known to mortals. Yet at the same time, there must be a calm, firm line of conduct and thought, which permits us to show love and tolerance for the offender, but which allows no sort of tolerance for the offense itself. If the mother, in her eagerness to show her love and sympathy for her boy, allows him perfect and unbridled license to smoke all about the place while she excuses it to her younger children or the neighbors, she is but fastening the chains of bondage more firmly about the soul of her erring son. If the youth cannot cease his smoking habit, he ought at least to have sufficient respect for his parents to refrain from smoking in their presence. Don't be deceived by the specious argument that it is dishonest to hide one's wrongdoing. If you must do wrong, I beseech you not to do your evil before the innocent eyes of my growing and undeveloped children. Example is the devil's best weapon. There is no virtue in open sin. Smoking dulls the intellect and often produces heart disease or cancer. This is, however, not the worst result of this deadly habit; the moral sense is deadened, and the light of the spirit quenched. It is doubtful if a tobacco-user can obtain or retain that fixed and full testimony and communion with the Spirit of God necessary to keep a man in full fellowship in the Church. What, therefore, may the mothers of such sons do to help? Two things may turn the tobacco user from his deadly habit. One is the conviction, by the victim, that the habit is a menace to life or health. The other, and by far the stronger incentive to reform, is the spiritual conversion of the victim to the divine message of the Word of Wisdom. In other words, the only one who can reform a tobacco user is himself. You may help a little, through love, and especially through prayer; but, after all, it is the grace of God which helps men and women to reform, and never in the history of the world has there existed a greater need for the preaching of the gospel than on this year of our Lord ? 1919! The gospel of Jesus Christ is the only key to health, happiness, and progress, here or hereafter.
