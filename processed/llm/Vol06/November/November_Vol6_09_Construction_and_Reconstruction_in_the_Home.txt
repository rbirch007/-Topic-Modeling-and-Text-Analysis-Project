The jumper idea, though having been used for years is still good, though each recurrence shows variation. This style is particularly useful in making over dresses. Very often the jumper may be cut in the neck and arm eye so as to hide the portion of the under-dress which is unsightly or out of style. The jumper also affords a touch of newness, as one may make either contrast in material or contrast in color. For example, we might use a plain material for a jumper of a skirt of plaid or stripe; or a figured jumper might be used with a plain material. Another advantage of the jumper is that it takes a small amount of material and affords much variety in finish of edges, length from the waist down, etc. By properly placing the length one may make the jumper to suit the figure. The waist to be used under the jumper also affords a number of possibilities. It may be made of voile, organdy, crepe or any fine, soft material, but is always made of lighter weight material than the skirt and jumper, but often of the same color as the skirt. The waist cut, or butterfly lines, or with the sleeve and waist all in one, are best suited to being worn under a jumper. The set in sleeve is not so good for this purpose as the seam, as the armeye often destroys the effect of unity. The edges of the jumper may be bound, pecoted, piped or faced. The belt or sash may be long or short, narrow or wide and may be buttoned or tied. Figure No. I is a black and white costume on jumper lines. The skirt is of black and white wool, check-finished on the edges, and straps over the shoulder, of black satin. The waist underneath of whit georgette crepe. One could also use a waist like the skirt for afternoon or street wear. This dress would be serviceable for many occasions and becoming to young girls as well as women. CONSTRUCTION AND RECONSTRUCTION. 663 The use of draperies over the skirt affords a splendid opportunity for makingover a party dress. The dress of the season before, can be made entirely new and up to date by covering with drapes. Even the color might be changed by the use of dyes. As most evening dresses are of light colors and silk materials, they can be very successfully dyed, but it is well to make sure you send it to a reliable dyer who understands his work enough not to ruin the goods. The drapery to be added may be either plain or figured. This year we have many beautiful designs and colors in the crepes and brocades suitable for drapes. Figure II was made from a dress of last year. The foundation is of sage-green satin, and was thoroughly cleaned and cut in camisole style at the top. The drapery is of block georgette crepe with a large figure in shades of the same green. This is livened by adding a band of gold cloth in the upper part of the waist and girdle, and rose of gold cloth also a piping of gold cloth around the lower part of the sleeve. Another idea, especially useful for a young girl, is the skirt set low on the long waist as in Figure III. This style of skirt may be made from last year's pleated skirt, by pressing the pleats out carefully. This style also affords a chance for the use of plain and figured materials or contrasting colors. The upper portion, as the design shows, is cut butterfly and may be made with either long or short sleeves. 664 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE. THANKSGIVING RECEIPTS.
