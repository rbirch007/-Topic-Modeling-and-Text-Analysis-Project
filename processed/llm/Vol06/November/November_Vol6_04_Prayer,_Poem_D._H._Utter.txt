Prayer, Poem D. H. Utter
======================================================================

Prayer. By D. H. Utter. Eternal One, I pray you teach me how to pray, Not Hke the chaplain who has pray'd for years. Nor learned prelate who prays for human ears, But like the bird that sings the livelong day. That I may Hear your voice in flash on mountain peak. In cataract and laughing wavelets song, Whose echoes herald coming of the dawn When even I can hear your silence speak. That I may See the hand that waves the magic wand Causing flowers to bloom on desert sand, And love to live by Arctic currents fan'd, Then through the charging cycles still beyond. That I may Smell the incense burn'd within love's bower. Where you distil the nectar for us all; While human passions drain the cup and fall, ]\Iay I but sense the odor of the flower. That I may Taste of every sweet that I am heir. Through your implacable, eternal law; And may I from your mystic fountain draw, Oh God, and ever know that you are there. That I may Feel the gentle hand of love divine Raise me from out the stricken slough of fear, That to my distraught vision I hold near And know that you are mine and I am thine. And when I Have reached forth and touched the hem Of garment that you wear, I pray you, Lord, For pow'r to see your face for my reward, That I may sense your presence more. Amen. Mountainhome, Idaho.
