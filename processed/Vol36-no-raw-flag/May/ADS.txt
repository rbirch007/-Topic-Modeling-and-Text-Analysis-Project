for sale. Another neighbor, Abigail Smith, offers to help with ideas and transportation. From a slow and unpromising beginning they build a profitable business. Joanna rears her children with love and devotion and for Penny's fourteenth birthday she plans a special party. N leaden feet, Joanna went to () the door and opened it. She took a deep breath. "Darling," she said to Penny. She lifted her head. "My dears, I'm so glad you could come." "Hello, Mrs. Niels,' Connie said primly. Her mouth pursed as she sidled past Joanna into the room. Joanna saw the quick eyes inventory the kitchen range, the absurd decorations. "I'll have to leave early, Mother doesn't want me in this neighborhood after dark." "But we've lots of time until then." Joanna bustled about, taking their coats and scarves, saying whatever gay and welcoming thing popped into her head. The prayer beat in her throat, please... Please, for Penny's sake, let the party be good, not anything to mar her day, please. "Did you ever play "Witches'?" she asked them, pushing laughter through her stiff throat. "It's fun." She described it. Connie sat on the davenette and Page 312 smoothed her red velvet skirt. "I'd rather not. It sounds too childish." Joanna swallowed hard. "Very well. Let's play this one... Called 'Ghosts,' and if Connie doesn't like it, she can read'a book." She forced them into it, hiding the firmness under the banner of her laughter. She gave the gay prizes she had bought, with a flourish. Slowly, slowly, the ice melted and the girls came on her side. Laughter came spontaneously from young lips. After awhile Joanna could leave the room, go into the kitchen to put last-minute touches on the cakes and the ice cream. The shrieks and the clamor of excited voices were music to her ears. They ate their refreshments in an ecstatic silence. Joanna watched Penny's face. There was no cloud upon it, nothing to sully the clear joy of having her friends about her, of showing them off to her mother. But when the party was over and the young guests ready to depart, the clouds rose stormily again. Penny was helping Connie into the lovely coat. "Do come again, Connie. Come often." Connie's mouth pinched. "I'll try. But I'm afraid Mother will have a fit when she finds out where I've been." Joanna stuffed her hands into her apron pockets so they would not strike out at the pursed, pink mouth, the too-wise eyes that bade contemptuous farewell to the little room. Under her eyes, the decora- JOANNA tions, prepared at such a cost of time, grew pathetic, the slip cover faded and sagged. Joanna fought fiercely to bring back the gaiety. Don't you understand, she wanted to cry out, how precious a thing Penny's friendship is? The friendship of anyone who really loves you. What does it matter if they live in a tent, if they love you, they have value? Ruth, a black-haired echo of Connie, nodded her head. "But we really had fun," she said, in frank wonder. Joanna saw the darts had gone into Penny's heart. Her eyes darkened with pain. Joanna had the wild desire to step in front of her daughter, as if by so doing, she could take the pain into herself. She heard her own voice speaking, quickly, lightly, "I'm so glad you could all come. You see, we're moving into another neighborhood, and we might not be able to be together again." "Mother!" Penny lifted enraptured eyes. "You didn't tell me! When?" Joanna swallowed. "Very soon. It's to be a house on a hill, out of the smoke." Connie smoothed the sleeve of her coat. "That will be different. Mother will let me go up there." Joanna watched with the helpless amazement of the adult, as her daughter received this information with shrieks of joy. "Won't that be simply super! Just out of this world?" HEN the evening meal was over, Joanna sat enthroned among her children, while they gazed on her with adoration and awe. "You really mean it, Mother? 313 A big house! Room for everybody to have a room? Oh, Mother, it will be so wonderful." Joanna gulped and wondered if there was a place she could get with a down payment not to exceed three hundred dollars. ' "Tll have a room of my own," David said, "a place where I can study without the rest of you getting in my hair." "Your precious old books!" Sally was hostile. "What I want is a place to hang my pictures without everybody painting beards on them." She hugged Penny. "You can have your room, too, and write your poems in it." "Poems?" Joanna turned to Penny. 'The girl's face was scarlet. "Sally! Why did you have to tell?" She rose and ran toward the bedroom. ""They're awful! Awful!" "Poetry." Joanna caught her breath. But of course, she should have known, Penny would never be one to hoard beauty, it would pour out of her like light, into other people's lives. "Poetry..:. I'm so glad." Abigail came over after supper to help with the night's work. She listened eagerly to every detail of the party, pausing in her kneading to look at Joanna's face. She made Joanna think of a silver-haired girl, in her ruffled blue apron. 'There was something young and wistful in her listening. But when she heard about Connie, her outrage knew no bounds. "You should have told her to go home! 'That's what you should have done. The idea! 'The very idea! What's the world coming to?" 314 Joanna sliced apples into a pie shell. "I don't know. When I was little, a party was an event. We talked about it for months, before and after. I can't remember ever noticing a house, or taking inventory of the cost of things." "It's their mothers!" Abigail said shortly, "putting their own snobbish ideas into their daughters' heads." "I I told them we were moving into a new house." Joanna looked up at Abigail. "I had tox, "Humph," snorted Abigail, "so they defeated you, the brave Joanna, who hasn't been downed by hurricane or famine, going down like nine pins before a bunch of little girls. I thought you were going to buy some new equipment?" "T was,' Joanna said unhappily. "I was going to do so many things. I was going to buy a small bakery and start out with just breads and pastries... A real shop." Abigail blew a curl from her forehead. "Well, you can still do it. The children can just wait for their house." Joanna set her chin. "No. The children need a home. A real one. Penny will need one more and more. I can't bear to have her left out, or have less than the others. She has a right to things. Poetry. Just think of it, Abigail, she's writing poetry." Abigail said softly, "Well, 'm not surprised. I've often told my Henry. 'Henry,' I've said, 'there is one person whose mind I wouldn't be afraid to look into. Penny Niels' mind would be like a flower garden, that sweet, from the looks of her and the things she does for her mother, and the gentle way she RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—MAY 1949 talks! Just like a flower garden,' I told him." Joanna came around the table to hug Abigail's | plump — shoulders. "You see, we have to give her lovely things, a chance in life." Abigail patted Joanna's hand. "We'll do it, my dear." OANNA stood at the kitchen table, the next afternoon, wrapping fresh loaves of bread in wax paper; the pale October sun splashed warmth across her hands and on the kitchen table. A woodpecker swung on the lower branches of the apricot tree, just outside the window. Someone knocked at the front door. Joanna impatiently finished the bread she had started and went to answer it, not pleased to have visitors interrupt her busy day. She frowned at the tall, red-haired man who grinned at her from his great, lean height. "Mrs. Niels?" "Yes, but I " return his smile. "You're busy, I know I'm Kent Taylor, and I understood that you are in the market for a house." Joanna's mouth dropped gently. "But, good heavens! I just made up my mind yesterday." "T know," he said, "I read minds by television. You want a house on a hill." Joanna laughed, reluctantly. "I suppose you know how much, or little, rather, I can afford to pay down?" He shook his head. "I never inquire into my clients' private affairs, such as love, money, or pet peeves. May I come in?" He She did not JOANNA sniffed the air, "It smells like a small corner of heaven." Joanna, leading him into the kitchen, wished suddenly she was wearing her new, high-heeled shoes, instead of the brown, flat brogues, She watched his eyes light up when he saw the crusty brown loaves on She | said, hesitantly, "Would... Would you like a slice of fresh bread and some strawberry Jam?" His grin was quick and pleased. "Would I? I don't believe I've ever tasted fresh, homemade bread in all my life - Mother was a Career woman.... Real estate. She and my sister are Tunning the business together. I'm home on vacation so they put me to work." He took a deep bite out of the slice of bread and jam. Hi "Brother! Now J see what people mean. This isn't the first time I've tasted your products. We had some Boston-baked beans last night. My sister was telling me about you my niece, too. In fact it was our charming little niece who told us you were in the market for a house." "Your niece?" "Uh-huh, Connie, she was here to a birthday party." "Oh," said Joanna. He looked around "You need a shop." "IT need a house," Joanna said. She looked at him wonderingly, marveling at his quick tongue, the €normous enjoyment he seemed to derive from very simple things. She liked the tweed suit he wore, and the snap brim was like him, past its first youth, somewhat battered, but Possessing to a high degree, dash and charm, the room. 315 "IT have a house," he said, "or rather Mother has -.. Ona hill. En could I take you to see it?" "T''ve so much to do. A "This afternoon, at Say, twothirty?" Reluctantly, Joanna nodded. He rose and picked up his hat. He looked soberly down at Joanna. "Connie is a difficult child. I think this is the first nice thing she ever did for me." Startled, Joanna looked into his blunt, homely face. She saw laughter Starting from deep down in his hazel eyes. His mouth twitched a little at the corners. "Thank you for the bread and jam, She closed the front door behind him and went back to the kitchen. She began again to wrap the bread, and then suddenly went to the kitchen mirror and peered into it. Not changed from yesterday, and yet, there had been something when he looked at her a relief... As though he had hoped she would be attractive and was not disappointed. Joanna turned sharply away. What an_ idiot! At an utter idiot, to imagine such a thing. But when she dressed, after lunch, she tucked one of Penny's bright scarves into the collar of her gray suit. The red and yellow scarf brought color into her cheeks and a sparkle to her eyes. Joanna brushed out her hair, let it wave softly around her face. But when she heard his car stop before the house, she tore out the scarf and pinned her hair back into the accustomed roll. She looked again in the mir- 316 ror. 'The gray suit and the neat white blouse looked Quaker prim, but the color had not departed from her face, and her eyes mocked her with their shining. She went to open the door for him. She nodded briefly, "You're on time." "So are you, a rare and delightful RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—MAY 1949 trait." He helped her into the shining car as though she were an object of great price and rare fragility. "I ordered the day especially for you." He waved an expansive hand to include the rich gold of the sunshine, the scarlet banners of maple trees, the blue haze on the mountains. (To be continued) >~<——- Luncheon Cloths for the Making Rachel K. Laurgaard Illustrations by Elizabeth Williamson AVE you ever stood looking through the table of discarded samples and bolt ends which drapery and upholstery shops sell for a fraction of their original cost, and racked your brain for some excuse to buy a lovely square of printed linen or hand-blocked cotton? Tapestry pieces make good cushion covers, or, with a pair of handles— an attractive knitting bag. But what could one do with a yard or so of chintz? Make luncheon and breakfast cloths, of course! Permanent-finished chintzes, picture-printed crash, cotton twills, and linens are all washable, and can be had from the sample table in the loveliest of colors and designs. Hem or fringe a quaint piece of flowered chintz, set out your collection of antique glass and china, and see what a charming table you have laid. Use a gorgeous tropical print in tones to blend with your breakfast pottery. You will find that the plainest of everyday china looks like something special when set on a striking sample square from the drapery shop. Braided Rugs—New-Fashioned Drucilla S. Howard OR an easier and better way of making the old-fashioned braided rugs you will need a large feed-sack needle and some stout string or carpet warp. You should be able to buy a needle at any hardware store. The rags are braided in the usual way. When ready to begin putting the strips together, fold the braided strip the length you wish the center of the rug to be, and with the needle, threaded with string, take up a loop of the braided strands, first on one side and then on the other. Always insert needle from top side of rug. Take up each loop, drawing the string snugly under each time. When working around the ends of the rug, take up two loops on the outside strand, (one on the inside) as many times as necessary to make the tug lie flat. When you have used up the string in your needle, tie the new piece of string to the end you have been using and thread the needle again. 'The knot can be pulled under the loops until hidden. The string will not show if pulled up snugly each time a loop is taken up. If you use two strips of cloth of different lengths in each strand you braid, it will not be necessary to sew the ends together. Just fold the ends Y one strip inside the other. Also the needle works better if it is not too sharp. = Spring Planting LeRoy Burke Meagher I followed the furrows which dad plowed up And helped with the seeding he had begun, By planting a sackful of corn which looked Like wrinkled-up pieces of autumn sun. The cool, moistened earth felt so good on bare feet And chunks of it stuck between all of my toes, As I walked along, with the sun on my back, And dropped little kernels of sun in the rows. Dawn Evelyn Fijeldsted _We hear a robin's soft ethereal call, A glad, sweet song at break of dawn, - And crocus blossoms, with their tears of dew, Like colored stars are sprinkled on the lawn. Page 317 Table Settings and Flower Arrangements Entertaining the Bride Mary Grant Judd Member, Relief Society General Board [This is the second in a series of short articles on table decorations, flower arrangements, and related subjects. In the coming months Mrs. Judd will present other suggestions suitable to particular seasons.—Ed.] INCE June is the month that more brides choose for their weddings than any other in the year, I want to give you, a month ahead, some ideas for announcements, showers, wedding receptions and so on.. When I think of brides, there often comes to my mind a line from "Peg O' My Heart," a popular play on Broadway in New York City years ago. So long ago, in fact, that I myself was about to be a bride. "In all this world,' remarked one of the characters who represented an older, experienced person in the play, "there's nothing half so sweet as love's young dream." That is why it is such a pleasure to plan social affairs for brides. Some of the joy that they are experiencing seems to spill over, and all of the guests, provided they have perennially young hearts, get their share. Putting first things first, let's talk about announcements. Although the actual announcement is seldom a surprise, it can be told in a surprising and orginal way. At one announcement luncheon, _ balloons were tied to ribbons attached to the stems of the flowers in the center of the table. Other balloons were at each place, and in them anPage 318 nouncements had been put before the balloons were inflated. When the balloons were popped, the announcements were discovered. Sometimes the news is tied in with the bride's background, with the business of the future bridegroom, or with the hobbies of either one of the bridal pair. To announce the forthcoming marriage of her daughter, one bride's mother, the wife of a doctor, passed around a good-sized prescription bottle filled with vitamin capsules in the largest size obtainable. These contained the names of the happy pair and, on the outside of the bottle, was the date of the wedding, the doctor's name, and his prescription: "Take one only for complete happiness." There are many clever ways of highlighting the display of a trousseau. What would we do without flowers, satin bows, and tiny silvery bells that have lain hidden in our stored Christmas decorations until pressed into service? If you have an old-fashioned walnut wardrobe try painting the inside with "shocking pink" as Schiapereli's favorite color is called. Make sachets of various pastel shades and pin-tack eight or ten TABLE SETTINGS AND FLOWER ARRANGEMENTS of them inside each door, which is left open to display household linens. GPEAKING of Christmas bells, the large ones are ideal to use for wedding decorations. One lovely garden wedding where a big bell had been hung (on a wide white satin ribbon) from the branch of a beautiful old tree. Under the bell was a round table holding the exquisite wedding cake and the charming picture was spotted with a flood light. Try pinning small white flowers to these Christmas bells as table decorations, OT, for a very striking effect, make a bell of chicken wire and completely cover it by wiring flowers to it. But, whatever you do, don't forget to sprinkle the flower arrangements with ice water and place them in the refrigerator until needed. In planning decorations for any large group, such as that included 319 in a wedding reception, try to visualize the crowd and have your decorations in large masses and rather high in the room so that they won't be lost when the guests crowd in. I have purposely left showers until the last because I'm afraid they sometimes work an imposition on those invited. Often the same group ls asked to several showers and then, as close friends of the bride, there is still a wedding pres ent to be given. If this is the case, and you still want to have this type of party, try having a spice shower. Send out invitations to the guest to bring "sugar OT spice Or anything nice," and she will not be emparrassed in this day of high prices. The little parasols illustrated this month could be used equally well for any spring patty oF for a bride's or baby showet. These little favors are made by inserting a swab stick in a round of plastic fab- (Continued on page 355) Magazine Subscriptions for 1948 Counselor Marianne C. Sharp HE general board takes this T opportunity to express heartfelt thanks and gratitude to the Relief Society officers, Magazine representatives, and subscribers who have demonstrated their loyal support of The Relief Society Magazine during the year 1948. The devotion with which the Magazine representatives throughout the Church have placed the Magazine in the homes of Latter-day Saints is indeed gratifying. Also a matter of joy and pride to the general board is the success of the representatives in placing the Magazine in the homes of many who are not members of the Church, but who may thereby learn of the ideals and accomplishments of Latter-day Saint women and partake of their spirit of service and enrichment of life. Subscriptions—1948 _ The subscription figure for December 31, 1948 (77,740) shows a loss of 3,238 from the subscription figure of December 31, 1947 (80,978). However, more than half of the subscription total for 1947 represented subscriptions taken out at the old subscription price of $1, and the total as of December 1948 reflects subscriptions at the new price of $1.50. Therefore, the general board feels that the Magazine representatives have worked exceptionally hard during 1948 and are deserving of special credit in having so. Successfully established the Magazine at the new price. Page 320 Because of carrying so many subscriptions during 1948 at the old subscription price, the general board regrets to report that the Magazine showed a small deficit at the end of 1948. However, it is confidently expected that one year from now the subscription figure will reveal a substantial increase and that the Magazine will be entirely self-supporting. For the full realization of these expectations, the general board enlists the continued efforts of the officers and Magazine representatives during the year 1949. Honor Roll Percentages Continuing the policy established in 1948, the membership figures on which the Honor Roll percentages for 1949 will be based, will be counted as of January 1949. This allows each Magazine representative to obtain from the secretary, at once, the membership figures of January 1949 on which her percentage for this year will be figured. In this way a Magazine representative may know all through the year the number of subscriptions she must obtain in order to be on the 1949 Honor Roll, New Features and Services The editorial department of the Magazine strives constantly to improve the quality of the Magazine and to add new features of special interest to Latter-day Saint women. It is gratifying to note the many new authors represented during the year, from so many different parts of the world, and to observe, also, the growth in literary skill of those MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR 1948 321 agazine, and many readers have teTough united effort fostered b ported enjoyment of the new fea.

Jones President, Spanish-American Mission Relief Society W* shall be able to wear our "nylons" a long time if we treat them with due respect. Keep an old pair of cotton gloves in the hose bag where they can be slipped on when removing your hose or putting them on. This is a good practice at any time, but especially when high prices of commodities make economy in all personal and household affairs essential. More hose are snagged from rough hands than from dining-room chair legs, and hose are more often discarded because of snagging than because they are worn out. As a matter of further protection and economy, try classifying your hose and keeping them in small paper bags. Label each bag plainly, giving the necessary information to eliminate the need of putting the hand into the hose to determine which pair is suitable to wear for each occasion.

Tanner and Secretary-Treasurer Nellie B. Bullock. Standing, left to right: Second Counselor Nellie R. Mecham; President Vida F. Swenson; First Counselor Alice B. Stephenson. In describing this outstanding accomplishment, Sister Swenson reports: "Had it not been for Sister Esthma Tanner, a devout member of our Relief Society, now seventyeight years old, we may not have begun this project. She said to the presidency: 'I have kept all of my Magazines, and have many of the earlier numbers. It would make me happy to place them where they would do the most good.' And so our collection began. We invited the membership to bring in as many Magazines as they could.... We contacted all our older members, out of-town people, and the Relief Society general board office.... Finally, all we lacked was one Magazine in volume 1." This precious number was secured, and in August 1948 the collection was complete and the ward Relief Society officers had all the volumes bound. Then they supplied the material, and the president's husband, A. Alfred Swenson, built an appropriate cabinet for housing the books. On December 7, 1948, this complete, beautiful, and priceless set of books, arranged in the cabinet, was presented to the Provo Third Ward Relief Society as a Christmas gift. Sister Swenson suggests: "While early Magazines yet exist, may other groups feel the desire to secure a full set for themselves, that this choice material may be preserved as a cherished treasure for generations to come." Josephine S. Bird is president of Utah Stake Relief Society. 348 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—MAY 1949 Photograph submitted by Helen Hassell NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MISSION, ASHLAND (OREGON) BRANCH RELIEF SOCIETY ASSEMBLES IN NEW CHAPEL FOR OPENING SOCIAL October 1948 Left to right, beginning with the third person, front row: Mary Burrows, district aid; Helen Hassell, President, Ashland Branch Relief Society; Marion Lusk, First This active and enthusiastic branch was organized three years ago with eight members.

And with many hours of cooking, sewing, and saving, they helped to bring the chapel project to completion." Built on the main road which leads to the historic home of Thomas Jefferson, "Monticello," this chapel will stand as a testimony to the divinity of the message of the restored gospel. The chapel was recently dedicated by President Bruce R. McConkie of the First Council of Seventy. Mabel A. Price is president of the Central Atlantic States Mission Relief Society.

"Well," Miss 'Tyndale said, "if you can stand a garrulous old woman a while longer, I'll tell you the story." Miss Tyndale flashed a smile that on anyone else would have been described as cryptic, on her it was half amusement. "One day," she began, "my youngest brother Ned came home from school with a friend. They must have been arguing, for the friend insisted I was going to marty 'T'om Wallcrist." "Who was Tom Wallcrist? I never heard of him," Nan cut in. "Tom Wallcrist was a young man with a plodding gait and a plodding heart, but he had a spark of fire in him." Her smile this time was for some secret memory in her heart. "Ned," she said, taking up the story again, "didn't like the idea of my marrying 'Tom. He came rushing in, all upset. "<7 was in the kitchen, down on my hands and knees scrubbing the floor. 'Jen,' he said, his face tortured, 'you aren't going to marry Tom Wallcrist, are you?' "T didn't know exactly what had gone on, but I guessed. More to comfort him than anything else, I said as I wrung out the mop cloth, 'I wouldn't marry Tom Wallcrist if he was the last man on earth.' "That satisfied him. He rushed out to his friend and said, 'Jen isn't going to marry Tom Wallcrist.

UTAH RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—MAY 1949 "What happened then?" Nan was breathless with curiosity. "Nothing," Miss' Tyndale said, matter-of-fact. "I was mortified for a minute, then I dismissed it as childish nonsense. You know how everyone talks in a small town. Within an hour I'd completely forgotten it. I didn't even think of it, when a man called me from the gate that evening. "T went out to see, and there was Tom. He was standing stiff as a rod on the other side of the fence. I walked up to him, but before I could get out a 'good evening' he stopped me by saying, "You might have waited until I asked youl' He didn't say another word, just turned his back and walked away." "But didn't he come back?" Nan insisted. "No, he didn't." Miss Tyndale scooped up a last handful of berries, her wrinkled face bland. "He left town right after that. He went out to Colorado and did right well in the cattle business—or so I've heard." "Oh, dear,' Nan's voice was a wail, "it shouldn't have ended that way. You should have gone after him and explained." "What was there to explain?" Miss Tyndale's voice was some eighty years mild. "You should have gone after him anyway," Nan insisted. Miss Tyndale's laugh was free from remorse. "Girls didn't 'go after men' in those days. Anyway, I'd have been too shy to say anything." So that was it! Nan saw it all in swift comprehension. Miss Tyndale had been too shy. I should have known it, Nan told herself. She YOU MIGHT HAVE WAITED wanted to call Winkie and say, | "Look long upon this face. In her you have touched hands with the past." Winkie, she realized, was too young. She could only hope that in the years to come, some remembrance of Miss Tyndale's face, some inflection of her quiet voice, or some fragrance from her garden would remain. With swift compassion, Nan took Miss Tyndale's wrinkled face between her strong young hands and kissed the startled lady on her furrowed cheek. "I'm glad you stayed," she whispered, her voice constricted with emotion. Miss 'Tyndale's usually steady hands were shaking. "I declare," she said, "I didn't know it was so late. You get that child of yours and we'll go in the house for a cookie. "You know," she told Nan as she led the way into the house," I think the view of the valley is even prettier from the living room this time of day."

Boiling water, with dry bread broken in it, and salt and pepper and butter. Christine set the table and turned the chairs facing outward. "Come, Donnie," called Mama. Each knelt by a chair. "Donnie, will you—?" "Dear Heavenly Father, thank thee for this day and..." with Mama's help he finished. "What a nice, close-of-the-day prayer, Donnie," whispered Mama. They sat at the table, eyes lowered, arms folded. "Christine—" ",.. And for this bread we thank thee..." "Amen." ' "Please pass a piece of Christine's cake," ventured Naaman, slyly, recompensed when Christine glared at him. "Well, you cut it like cake, in wedges." "Look at the slices Mama cuts. They're straight," shrilled Donnie. Why did Donnie have to speak so umnecessarily loud, thought Christine, as she looked enviously at the even brown slices Mama had cut. "Maybe it's the knife," said Mama. "Maybe it's tired. It's getting very old, you know. It crossed the plains with Grandma. "Was it an Indian knife, Mama?" Naaman was excited at the thought. "To scalp with?" added Donnie. "Donnie!" Christine looked at him disgustedly. "After all, we're eating!" "Oh, no," Mama put in, "nothing so romantic. Just one from a A PATTERN FOR CHRISTINE hardware store in Kirtland, one of the few not burned by the mobs. Grandpa used to sharpen it out here in the orchard on the old grindstone." "Did you help?" shouted Donnie. "I put drops of water, from a can, on the stone as he ground. But oh, just so much water; not too many drops." "May I be excused, Mama; I'm finished?" asked Donnie. "Certainly, dear." Donnie lay on the floor, one foot in the air. "It feels so good, Mama; it feels so good to have a sliver in your foot." "Christine, dear, will you clear the dishes while I take care of Donnie, please?" "Sure, Mama." Mama filled the washbowl with hot soapy water and put it on a chair beside her rocker. She sat in the rocker and held out her arms. "Come here, Donnie, I have a story to tell you. "A story, goodie!" He limped over and climbed on her lap. "Have you seen Dr. Johnson driying his fine horse and buggy around town?" "With his black bag." supplied Donnie. "Well, Naaman says, some day he is going to be the doctor and drive such a fine horse and buggy." "Me, too," interrupted Donnie, "I'm going to have a bigger buggy; a long square one with fringes, like Brother Nolte's. And a gray, spotted horse. Brother Nolte let me hold the reins and put the buggy whip back in the holder." "Wouldn't you like a fine doctor 357 CG "Satisfaction: (uaranteed SEARS ea ROEBUCK AND CO. Money Back!"

"You can hold it." "Will you play a game with me?" bargained Donnie. "Tf you don't bawl." THE blue twilight slowly claimed the quiet, country town, circled in the sure, close embrace of the hills. The are light on the corner blinked and then flared its pale, morning-glory of light on the wide, dirt road. Children seeped from all the homes in the neighborhood, whooping. "R-uvn, my sheep, run " Christine tingled with delight. It was delicious. It was heaven. A young, brown elbow touched her own in the dusk; patched overalls, in running, brushed her faded apron. The dusk air twined her curls with coolness and washed her with ecstacy.... The curfew tolled across the summer night and the street grew still again. When they went in Mama was ironing Mrs. Boyne's beautiful, embroidered pillowslips. "Oh, Mama, save one for me to iron." "The prettiest, the very prettiest, Pll save for you to iron tomorrow, because you iron so well, Christine. You'll soon be too much competition for me. And now to bed, and don't forget your secret prayers, because that's the way to get the things you need and sometimes even the things you want, if they're right for you to have." RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—MAY 1949 Mama tucked the sheet over Chnistine and kissed her twice. "Oh, Mama, I love you." "And I love you. It's such fun to have a little girl. Just wait and see,' Mama whispered gaily, and then went back to her ironing.... EK OK OK ¢STUST wait and see "Oh, Mama!' Christine's head fell to her arms on the machine, and all the rest of the bitterness sobbed out of her in a silent prayer. Mama, brave, wonderful, cheerful Mama Christine opened her eyes and sat up. Someone seemed to be near. Cherished words came back to her —oh, not in tones her ears could hear, but in words her heart could understand. It was the remembrance of Mama. Her mother's smile, her words, seemed to return in vividness and beauty. Mama would always be here with her. She would never be alone. Christine sat looking at the summer gold that lay outside, and she felt a deep contentment. She was comforted. She drew her eyes back to the unfinished sewing. The pattern sheet, yes, the pattern, Mama had always said that if the pattern was good, she would be wise to follow it until she grew adept enough to devise her own. Her confident hand patted the folded paper. Tomorrow, she would finish the sewing. She would use the pattern. She heard the scrunch of Dave's anxious, hurried steps on the walk, and caught the sound to her singing heart. The door opened. "Christine, | Christine,. Herm?" Bright with her old smile, she moved into his arms. How's Auerbach's Makes It Easy For You To Knit Yourself A Dress Knitting is an easy and fascinating hobby.
