Midas and the Five Senses Lilacs After Rain Eva Willes Wangsgaard The spring returns the gold we lost In cups of daffodils, And golden lightbirds dip and rise Along the window sills. With gold to see and gold to touch Where water lilies float, And tinkling notes like nuggets tossed From every warbler's throat, A golden scent from hyacinths, And honey gold to taste, Five paths of gold lead to the heart. Come. Who would let it waste? Jeanette P. Parry Who has not loved the wild, sweet smell Of lilacs blooming after rain, Or walked a petal-covered path On fallen blossoms down the lane? So often I have picked bouquets, Dew-dripping, lavender, and white, And placed them in a pale blue bowl To lend their fragrance to the night.
