Unwritten Song | Anna Prince Redd I have not written a hymn to the flag Nor an essay on liberty, But I've seen an eagle surmount a crag, And waves, lashing in from the sea, Drive at a granite ledge And retreat in futility. I've lain at rest On a sunlit crest And the stag companioned me. I have not written a chorus To the Lincolns of history, But the freedoms ransomed for us Are my integrity. Their voices are heard in the mechanized din And wherever the word of freedom has been: The cadence of creature and crag is strong, As sunlight, and heartthrob— And unwritten song.
