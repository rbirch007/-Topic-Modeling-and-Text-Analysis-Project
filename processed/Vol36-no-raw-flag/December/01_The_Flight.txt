The Flight Dorothy J. Roberts the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt.... To shadowed Egypt from the starlit manger, There hide your infant from the Herod blow; Cold here the blade and sharp the steel of danger, But the Nile will remember only Pharaoh. Skirt the plains where sacred sandals wandered Lost in the wilderness of long ago; Mark by a new light the sea's arm, sundered, And the broken thread of the Jordan's flow. Where dim altars breast the moon's pale weather, Where legends lived before the parchment scroll, And your feet will tread the sands where many another Walked sunrise on the pathway of the soul. Their sleeping legions in your mind will waken, When you shall see the past with visioned eye, The mighty monuments by years unshaken, And hear again the thunder over Sinai. His promised light will lengthen by the sedges— Where Miriam put a cradle-craft to sea— Till it shall burn, the high noon of the ages, Its golden zenith over Galilee.
