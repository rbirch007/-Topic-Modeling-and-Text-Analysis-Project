Overtone Dorothy J. Roberts ' So faint a sound to pierce my lethargy, Only an overtone escaping from your word, Some undefinable in minor key, Beyond all meter, rather felt than heard. Small as a seed in my heart's darkened loam, Its roots have quickened in my hungering Till its stock and pedicel are phlox in bloom, More swift, more beautiful, than sudden spring.
