AUGUST 1949 Sand and Slame Anna Prince Redd Twilight, dark above the desert, Banks the embers of the sun, Close against the sand dunes Now the tawny day is done; Spikes them sharply down arroyos, Spreads them hot and furnace bright Over beds of twisted lava, Where they smoulder through the night. Lizards, shadowless as shadows, Lie with round, unlidded eyes, Watchful of the tufted hummock Where the hidden rattler lies. Darkness falls; the night begets Fantastic shapes with ghostly arms, Weird and lonely silhouettes, A frenzied breed with human forms. Coolness comes. Light-winged as moth, The heavy yucca scent is thinned; The desert sands lie still and wait Tomorrow's resurrection wind.
