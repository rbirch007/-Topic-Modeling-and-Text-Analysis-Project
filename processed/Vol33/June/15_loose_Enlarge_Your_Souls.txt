enlarge your souls toward each other, if you would do like Jesus.:. You must be long-suffering, and bear with the faults and errors of mankind... Let kindness, charity and love, crown your works henceforward (D. H. C. IV, page 603 ff.). These instructions, given only eleven days after the organization of Relief Society, were necessary to the understanding of the sisters of that day. These pronouncements have been followed and have prescribed the administrative policy of the Society for a hundred years. Relief Society members are all sisters in the gospel, but members of a Relief Society unit may be appointed, by those ordained to preside over and lead them, to different offices as the circumstances shall require. When any Relief Society member is thus called to fill an office of the Relief Society, it is the duty of all other members to sustain this sister, called to preside over the rest, with full loyalty, devotion, and with singleness of heart. Other members, endowed with different talents and. Capabilities, may be called to fill other offices until the organization is completely officered. The duty of each member of Relief Society is twofold: first, to sustain with every power at her command those who have been called to preside over her in any capacity; and second, to magnify her own EDITORIAL calling with every ability at her command. By following these two rules, no taint of criticism or jealousy will find lodgment in the heart of any Relief Society member. On _ the contrary, her devotion to the Society and her unselfish works will constantly enlarge her soul; and the work of Relief Society that of self-improvement and loving service for others will show a marvelous growth. By the united support of the other Relief Society members and through her own prayerful efforts, even a timid sister or one who does not feel herself to be capable of assuming the leadership of a Re- 399 lief Society, will be blessed and strengthened to carry on her work successfully; and, with the policy inaugurated in recent years of releasing officers at more frequent intervals than in earlier years, the terms of office have been shortened and many more women thus become trained in leadership. Only as each individual Relief Society member forgets self and strives through prayer and good works to enlarge her soul, will kindness, charity and love crown her works; and Relief Society fulfill its destined place in furthering the work of the Church. In Memoriam Alice Robinson Richards THE General Board of Relief Society and the membership in all the stakes and missions of the Church pay loving tribute at this time to the memory of Sister Alice Robinson Richards, wife of President George F. Richards of the Council of the Twelve Apostles. Sister Richards passed away April 21, 1946, at the age of eighty-one. Sister Richards, the devoted mother of fifteen children, was an ardent worker in the auxiliary organizations of the Church, and a faithful and inspiring missionary. She accompanied her husband on many of his journeys and was with him during the last part of his presidency of the European Mission. She will be remembered with love and appreciation by thousands of temple workers who recall her faithful ministry as Salt Lake Temple matron from 1921 to 1937. Sister Richards lived a full life, a life of service, kindness, and devotion. She will be long remembered by the women of the Church as an ideal mother in Zion. <i ?? Who can find a virtuous woman? For her price is far above rubies. The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her... She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life... She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her. Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all. Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised. Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates. (Proverbs 31:10-12, 27-31).
