MOTHERS OF THIS DAY Gene Romolo THE CUP Mothers of this day, the acrid cup That life so often brims and brims anew For woman's lips, is once more lifted up, Brimming with its bitterness for you; And you, whose will would dash the cup to earth, Must dnnk long draughts from it. Do pangs and fears, That you have suffered at man's hour of birth, Appear ill-recompensed in these dire years? Then, Mothers, think of her, who, weeping, stood Beside a cross and watched athwart a hill, Its shadow deep, until a lowered rood Yielded from its nails her Son grown still! Mary drained the cup of Calvary When she beheld her Son's death agony. COMPENSATION When Time shall fold Grief's veil back from each face, And you behold an ideal in a morrow That you have helped to mold, and, by God's grace, You learn that she, the mother of all sorrow, Is not the one whose son, hate crucifies, But she beneath whose heart, in embryo, A Judas lay; then, verily your eyes, Now drenched with tears, will shine with prideful glow, For never falls a hero but is bred A valiant spark that grows into a flare To illuminate the way that lies ahead? You, mothers of this day, who still must share The honor that your loyal children win In conflict to defeat a scourge of sin. TRANSFIGURATION After Calvary, transfiguration As surely comes as day succeeds the night; Blackout now is lifted, and each nation Is flooded with beneficence of light. Young mothers in the crook of their fond arms Will cradle proudly many a wee head, Assured of safety from world-clutching harms, Because another generation bled And died a generation that you bore. Mothers of this day, because of you, the soil Will be resculptured patterned as before Grim-visaged men laid waste the fruits of toil, And the bird of peace again will build its nest, To brood strong fledglings under wings and breast.
