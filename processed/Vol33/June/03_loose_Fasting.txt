Fasting Priscilla L. Evans Member, Relief Society General Board total abstinence from food and drink for a prescribed period, or it may mean only a certain restraint in respect to the partaking of food. Fasting is a very old practice, perhaps as old as recorded history. It seems to have developed out of the desire for proper preparation for communion with divinity; hence, its universal occurrence in some form or other in all religions. By curbing the appetites and the passions, fasting becomes a means of moral discipline and induces extraordinary receptivity to spiritual impressions. In the words of an ancient writer (Chrysostom), "it makes the soul brighter and provides it with wings to mount and soar." In ancient Israel, fasting was, in the earlier times, spontaneous not regulated by law. The purpose seems to have been to arouse Jehovah's pity (2 Sam. 12: 22); to avert national calamity (1 Sam. 31: 13) an expression of grief (2 Sam. 1: 12); or to render a man fit for special revelation or communication with God (Ex. 34: 28). When Moses received from God the Ten Commandments, he said:  "FAST" may mean either a When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the Lord made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water: And the Lord delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God (Deut. 9:9). Daniel, before his communion with God, and the visions which he experienced, fasted: I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.... And I Daniel alone saw the vision; for the men that were with me saw not the vision.... Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard... (Dan. 10: 3, 7, 12). Elijah's revelation, too, came to him after forty days and forty nights of fasting: And the angel of the Lord came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee. And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God. And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and behold, the word of the Lord came to him... (1 Kings 19: 7-9): The misfortunes that in later times befell the Jewish people brought about the establishment of many fast days. Some are days of penance and humiliation, but many are days of exhilaration and joy? festival. Days. And, too, fasting is prescribed on certain memorial days. An orthodox Jew fasts on his birthday after reaching the age of thirteen, and on the birthday of his Page 363 364 first-born son until the latter reaches the age of thirteen, both in commemoration of the sparing of the first-born of the Israelites in Egypt. The anniversary of the death of parents is also observed by fasting. Fasting with the Jews always means entire abstinence, and lasts from daybreak until "the appearance of the first three stars," excepting only on the Day of Atonement, when the fast begins with sunset of the preceding day. Children, pregnant women, and the sick are exempted from the observance of the fast. The Jewish Passover, combining the fast and its penance with the feast and its exhilaration and joyousness, is one of the greatest of all religious celebrations. It epitomizes the religion and aspirations of a great people, and has been celebrated with great faith and with earnestness for more than thirty centuries. The Passover is an inspiring festival, for it is filled with hope, and the ceremonies attendant upon its celebration are dramatic, depicting in action, by means of symbols, both the tribulations and the gladness of the Exodus. Since all, even the very poor, must share in the blessings of the feast, itis obligatory upon every Jew who can afford it, to contribute money to a fund out of which matzoh (unleavened bread) and other Passover necessities are provided for the poor and needy. This fund is known as Mo'ot Hittim (wheat money). The matzoh is made of dough that has not been fermented. The Israelites were commanded (Ex. 12: 14-15): And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the Lord throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever. Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread... For whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel. This deprivation is, of course, symbolic of the circumstances of the flight of the children of Israel to the Promised Land: And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste... And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders (Ex. 12: 33-34). FARLY in his ministry, our Lord and Savior set the pattern and molded the ideas of Christianity in the matter of the fast, and this has been followed, in its simplicity, by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from its beginning. Although he himself fasted for forty days and forty nights before beginning his ministry (Matt. 4: 2), during his lifetime Jesus seldom referred to fasting. He left no regulations for the fast. He made it clear that his followers were expected to fast, described an acceptable fast, and left it to the Church to make rules for carrying out his teachings. In reply to the question, "Why do the disciples of John fast often.. And thine eat and drink?" he answered: "Can ye make the children of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days." Our Church has interpreted this to be a direct exhortation to fast when the Savior FASTING was no longer with his people in the flesh. In the Sermon on the Mount (Matt. 6: 16-18), the Savior condemns all ostentatious fasting and, at least by inference, all public display of contrition or humiliation. He said: Moreover, when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast.... But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a member learns in early childhood that fasting is a matter personal to each individual? a privilege with a blessing promised. He learns, too, that among the early revelations in this dispensation, the Lord revealed his will, even by way of commandment, in this manner: "Also, I give unto you a commandment, that ye shall continue in prayer and fasting from this time forth" (Doc. And Cov., Sec. 88:76). And from that time to the present day fasting with prayer has been a regular observance within the Church. The service which attends this day of fasting and prayer is unostentatious and simple as the Savior directed that it should be. In June 1833, the Lord, in a revelation given through the Prophet Joseph, commanded the saints to "build a house," and directed that the inner court "be dedicated unto me for your sacrament offerings, and for your preaching, and your fasting and your praying..." (Doc. And Cov., Sec. 95). The saints obeyed 365 this commandment, and the Kirtland Temple, the first temple built by special command of the Most High in this dispensation, was erected. We read that the temple was occupied by crowded assemblies on the first Thursday in each month, "that day being observed strictly by the Latter-day Saints, as a day of fasting and prayer." These meetings were called "fast meetings" and it is recorded that they were "hallowed and interesting beyond the power of language to describe." Eliza R. Snow thus wrote of these fast meetings: I have here seen the lame man, on being administered to, throw aside his crutches and walk home perfectly healed; and not only were the lame made to walk but the blind to see, the deaf to hear, the dumb to speak, and evil spirits to depart. On fast days, Father Smith's constant practice was to repair to the temple very early, and offer up his prayers before sunrise, and there await the coming of the people; and so strictly disciplined himself in the observance of the fast as not even to wet his lips with water until after the dismissal of the meeting at 4 P. M. (Andrew Jenson, Historical Record, pp. 74-80). Others of the early saints have testified to the faith-promoting experiences of the Thursday fast meetings in Kirtland. Zina D. H. Young and her brother, O. B. Huntington, in their youth attended these meetings. They have left vivid descriptions of these experiences. Zina D. H. Young, who became the third General President of the Relief Society, was fourteen years old when she came with her father's family to Kirtland. Late in her life, indeed when very aged, Zina spent several days at her brother's home in Springville, Utah, and they relived the fast meetings held in Kirt- 366 land. It is interesting to learn from their narrative that all labor was laid aside on Thursday just as on Sunday. The temple was always well filled, and after the opening exercises, Joseph Smith Sr., the father of the Prophet, would cause the curtains or "veils" (as the Lord had called them in the commandment) to be let down, thus to divide the room into two, three, or four spaces, so as to allow a number of persons to bear testimony simultaneously. All were given the opportunity to speak in tongues, sing in tongues, pray or prophesy, as the spirit might lead them. Many offered a prayer instead of speaking, and when doing so, they knelt, and sometimes all the congregation would kneel with them. Brother Huntington says: "Fast days in the temple were very notable occasions and were looked forward to with a kind of hallowed anticipation." (See "Fast Days in the Kirtland Temple," by O. B. Huntington, Young Woman's Journal, VIII, page 239.) The saints continued to observe fast day on the first Thursday in each month, but on occasion special fasts were observed. Because they were in dire distress and filled with anxiety during and immediately following the Nauvoo period, they sought guidance and assistance from God in fasting and prayer. Not only did they seek the favor of the Lord in this way, but they also gave their expressions of gratitude for favors received. The Prophet Joseph wrote in his diary on Tuesday, January 17, 1843: This being the time appointed by the Twelve as a day of humiliation, fasting, praise and prayer, and thanksgiving before the great Elohim, I attended a public meeting in my own house, which was crowded to overflowing. Many other meetings were held in various parts of the city, which were well attended, and there was great joy among the people that I had once more been delivered from the grasp of my enemies. AFTER the saints established themselves in the Vallev. They continued to observe fast day on the first Thursday of the month, but on November 6, 1896, the First Presidency and the Council of the 'Twelve issued a proclamation changing the time for the observance of fast day to the first Sunday in each month. It has been so observed since that time. The saints thus assembled in prayer and fasting are privileged to make an offering for the care of the poor. We are taught that man may hope in vain for an answer to his prayers if these prayers come up before the throne of grace mingled with the cry of the suffering and the wail of the destitute and the hungry. This day of fasting and prayer, with the collection and distribution of the offerings of the day, is but one feature in the great system of active benevolence in the Church. But it is an important feature and a very old one. President Brigham Young tells us that "before tithing was paid, the poor were supported by donations" (Discourses of Brigham Young, page 262). Always a consistent advocate of the fast as a spiritualizing influence, President Joseph F. Smith, in clear and direct terms, expressed the law of the fast as today observed by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He said: The law to the Latter-day Saints, as understood by the authorities of the FASTING Church, is that food and drink are not to be partaken of for twenty-four hours, 'from even to even,' and that the Saints are to refrain from all bodily gratification and indulgences. Fast day being on the Sabbath, it follows, of course, that all labor is to be abstained from. In addition, the leading and principal object of the institution of the fast among the Latter-day Saints was that the poor might be provided with food and other necessities. It is, therefore, incumbent upon every Latter-day Saint to give to his bishop, on fast day, the food that he or his family would consume for that day, that it may be given to the poor for their benefit and blessing; OT in lieu of the food, that its equivalent amount, OF, if the person is wealthy, 4 liberal donation in money, be so reserved and dedicated to the poor (Gospel Doctrine, page 306, quoting from Improvement Era, VI, Dec. 19?3- See also Editorial, Deseret News, Church Section, Dec. 1, 1945:) It must be recognized, too, that in addition to the increased spiritual strength attendant upon the fast, there comes a feeling of quiet re pose and a sense of well-being which is reflected in our physical selves. The abstinence is, excepting in rare cases, beneficial to health, and those individuals who are harmed by fasting are exempted from the fast. Upon the testimony of reputable physicians, the rest afforded the digestive organs during periods of fasting has definite curative powers. The brain 's stimulated during fasts and 367 intellectuality is increased. The public speaker, the singer, the pianist, and others whose success depends upon unhindered mental powers, soon learn that they can give their best effort when the stomach is unburdened. We should keep in mind always that the Lord has instituted this law; that it is simple and pet fect and if we observe it we shall learn that it is based on reason and intelligence. No harm, but only benefit, can come to one through a strict observance of the law of the fast. The spirit in which this commandment of the Lord is obeyed: s more important than the fastings and the prayers and the offerings. Is your fasting "acceptable"? Through the Prophet Zechariah, the Lord declared the "acceptable fast": cy and compassion every man to his brother; and oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart" (Zech. 7: g-10). Fasting is, of course, an act of temperance, a reverential abstinence, but it can find its full perfection only in following the admonitions of the leaders of the Church regarding the fast and the use of the offerings made possible by the abstinence.
