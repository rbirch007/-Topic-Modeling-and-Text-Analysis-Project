REMEMBERING Dott J. Sartori After he has known suffering  This lad in khaki, in navy, in white  The thunder of hate, the rapier of greed, The heat and cold intemperate, After the white sheet of mercy is laid Cool and quiet across his wound, He will remember the Testament Where love was kindled and hate disowned. He will loose Christ from the printed Book, He will bring Easter against the tomb, When he returns, remembering, Back to this city and to this room.
