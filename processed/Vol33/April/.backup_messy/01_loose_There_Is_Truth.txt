There is Truth Eva Willes Wangsgaard
PROVIDENCE has a way of seeing that we get the right mates, if we're obedient. Anyway, that's how it was with Henry and me.
My father wanted me to marry Eph Wilson, and Brother Matt Wilson, Eph's father, was as eager as mine to see us make a go of it. I suppose they felt that a friendship at the as theirs could yield only good fruit.
When father asked me, "Why don't you like Eph, Elvira?" all I could say was, "He has big feet and he dances like a clodhopper," but Eph had more serious faults than that. My granddaughters would call him a wolf. You see, a girl couldn't tell her father that.
It mattered about the dancing though, too. Glory! How I loved to dance! Just the twang of a fiddle set my blood to leaping like a mountain brook. It still does.
But there was one reason why I enjoyed being squired around by Eph, and that was Melissa Bates. There was a girl for you, and she was wild about Eph. It wasn't just spite in me either. I had an old score to pay off with that young lady. See my hand. That scar. Still puckers my palm. Well, I owe that to her. Pushed me against a stove. She claimed it was an accident, but I saw her eyes.... But that's another story.
The best dance of the year was held on a midwinter's night, and the man you went with was supposed to be the one and only. We began to plan for a high after Christmas, and
the year I met Henry I had decided that I was going to have a new calico dress for that party. Mother had given me my first pair of boughten shoes, I mean, the first pair that had been made back East. They had shiny pointed toes and high heels and high tops. They were elegant and I was proud of them.
A calico dress wasn't bad, even for February, when you remember that we made our dresses with tight-fitting basques and lined them and had very full skirts. I knew I'd be happy in a new calico, much as I'd love a silk or velvet.
Sister Comer, out at the flour mill, needed a girl for two or three weeks, so I went to work for her, helping to cook for the mill hands and caring for her family and doing general housework. When I visited at home, Mother and I planned the new dress. But I couldn't see my way clear to getting hoops for it. I was earning two dollars a week, and that was good pay, too, but hoops cost four or five dollars and so would the calico, so how could I get both?
One night I was sitting by the Franklin stove in Mother's sewing rocker, crocheting lace, when father said, "Elvira, I suppose you'll be going to the big dance with Eph."
I felt panicky. Eph? The big dance? Suddenly I shouted, "No!"
Father went white and got up and strode outside. When he came back in, he said, "I've been figuring, and I think I'll be able to get the hoops for your dress." 
THERE IS TRUTH I looked up at him so relieved and happy that I must have shone. He fumbled for words before he added, "That is, if you'll consent to go with Eph." I laughed and hugged him and promised. How I did regret that promise! It was the very next day that I met Henry. I had two buckets of water I had just drawn from the well. I looked up from the windlass, and there stood a young man by the corner of the mill. He was bareheaded, his hair thick and yellow as wild currants, fit to dazzle my eyes. I stood with my mouth open staring like a little girl at her first boughten doll. Then I caught myself and turned away, my face burning clear back to my ears. But Henry called out, minute." So I stopped, and he came up to me and said, "You must be Elvira Lowham. My brother says you are working for his wife. I'm Henry Comer, Jim's brother, and I've come to live with them. Here, let me take that water." HE lifted both buckets. "They're too heavy for you," he said. "Jiminy cricket! You're no bigger than a linnet. Honest, are you seventeen? Jim says you are." I owned up to being seventeen and he carried the water into the house. But we didn't see much of each other after that, for all we worked so close together. We were too busy. But we did get snatches of talk now and then, evenings after the dough was set. Sometimes we stood out by the well, looking at the stars and the snow and the cold hills. I told him about the big dance 239 and found out that he was Crazy about dancing, too, and that he would be there. He wanted me to go with him, but there was my promise to father, and what could I do? Nobody was ever sorrier about a bargain than I was over that one. But how else could I get the hoops for my dress? I didn't lie awake nights, though, much as I was scheming and figuring. When you're up at five-thirty of a morning and are kept busy washing dishes, scrubbing floors, and bending over washtubs you're glad to hit the pillow at night, and you go to bed to sleep. My! My! But I hardly got a chance to see how pretty the sun was, shining on the snow, unless I was out after water or hanging out clothes. The Comers had a little boy, David, who was a joy to be around. The first day I came he treated me like a guest, taking me to see a tree that he said was a "tree-apple" because it had apples on before the snow came. He showed me the mill and the well. He was a happy little coot, in spite of his solemn talk and his grown-up ways. Henry adored him. He told me once that heaven could offer a man no greater blessing than a son like David. So the days went by and I was contented seeing Henry at meals, and sometimes in the evenings. I decided that it was better to go to the dance with Eph and get a few turns with Henry than to miss both, and I kept busier than corn in a poppet. First thing I knew, Mrs. Comer's niece came to help her and I was free to go home, and there were only three days left before the dance. Wilson's store had a piece of red calico with small figures of blue, 240 black, and white. I bought that because red was my color, what with my dark curls and brown eyes. I got some big black buttons, too. The colors in our calico were much harder than in the prints we buy now, but I thought that was pretty. It was, too, lots prettier than homespun. Mother was a good hand with the needle and she helped me cut out and fit the dress. But stitching at night by the unsteady flame of a small coal-oil lamp made doing a good job difficult, especially with so little time, and I was hard pressed to get my dress done. Fact is, I didn't get the buttonholes worked. I just cut them and hoped that, what with the lining, they'd hold, and what with the big buttons, they wouldn't show. But the worst of it was that the afternoon of the dance it started to snow, and by evening it had whipped up into a right smart storm. The dance hall was a good two miles from our home, and father began to worry. He kept window-watching the weather, and finally, he said, "Elvira, my girl, it looks as if there'd be no dancing for you tonight." I looked up from the dishes I was washing and turned toward him, "Why not?" He said, "Look at the weather." "Who cares about the weather?" I asked, and slashed at a plate that was already clean. "I do," said father, "you can't go out in that blizzard. You'd freeze." I began to cry and said, ""Why did I work that hard all those weeks? And what is there to live for?" and a lot of other things. Then I went out the back door to throw out the dishwater. The wind nearly tore the pan from my hands. I returned and pushed the door shut by backing up hard against it, and wiped the dishpan and hung it up. FATHER said, "You're not going out in that storm tonight." His gray eyes were getting narrower and narrower and he'd begun to twist his heavy black forelock. I began to be afraid that I really would have to stay at home. So I began to pet and coax. Finally, he picked up a chair and set it down hard and said, "'All right. If you can stand out in that weather for five minutes, I'll let you go to the dance." Whew, it was cold! And the wind! I could barely pull the door to behind me, but I did, and I went out and stayed out. I couldn't tell how long five minutes was and I didn't dare to go back in for fear it would be too soon and I'd lose out. Father gave in first. He came out after me. So I got ready for the dance. I slipped on my new red calico and stood on a chair to see, by the mirror in mother's dresser, how the hoops hung. I climbed down and did a turn or two to view the tips of my new shoes before I calmed down and began to pin up my side curls and to coax my bangs to lie flat. I rubbed a little of the over-bright color of my cheeks down with a stolen pinch of mother's precious potato starch. After awhile Eph came and mother gave us some bricks she had warmed and wrapped for my feet, and I put on my heavy coat. We had quilts and robes, and the going wasn't so bad. Anyway, when I was off to a dance, I was too excited to feel cold. THERE IS TRUTH But on the road I kept scheming for a way to get a little extra time with Henry. I thought and thought so much that I didn't notice when we drew up in front of the dance hall, till the team stopped and Eph made ready to hop down and help me out. I felt his big hand on my shoulder and reacted without thinking. I gave a little kick at just the wrong time at just the wrong angle. He caught his foot in my hoops and down he went sprawling onto the snow where the horses had trampled it hard. I scrambled down to help him, and there, in a strip of light from the doorway, stood Melissa. The sight of her gave me an idea. Melissa lived only a short way from the hall; she was crazy over Eph. What a set-up! I knelt down and began to make over Eph. I knew he wasn't injured, but Melissa didn't, and she'd give anything to walk into that party with Eph, or, at least, to keep me from doing it. Melissa was beside us instantly and was helping Eph to his feet. She put her hand on his head, feeling for the bump. I stole a peek at the folks gathered around, and there was Henry, so I couldn't say another word. Besides, Eph was in tender hands, and capable ones, too. More capable than I knew. Melissa said, "Elvira, you can't do anything more to help. Why not go inside out of the cold? I'll take Eph over home. It's so near. I'll get him fixed up a little." She looked at Henry. "Do you know each other? I suppose not. Mr. Comer, may I present Miss Lowham? Perhaps, you wouldn't mind escorting her inside. That's a dear." And that settled 240 it for Melissa and Eph, and, I thought, for me and Henry, too. But I didn't know Henry. He crooked his arm and I took it and we hurried into the hall where the fiddlers were striking up a polka. I was thrilled! I do believe that if the lamps had been suddenly blown out, no one would have missed their light for the shine of me. And then I caught Henry's eyes. They were as cold and forbidding as winter seas. He danced the first number with me, as it was his duty to do, but after that he kept as far away as the hall allowed. I tried not to show how it hurt, and I danced madly, a polka, a schottische or two, and a quadrille. We were tripping a varsovienne when Eph came in with Melissa. He had a headache, mostly plain temper, and he was dour as a camel. He danced a little, but not with me. Mostly he sat on a bench and sulked. I saw Melissa arguing with Henry. After a time she came to me and said, "Eph isn't feeling well and wants to go home, but he doesn't want to disturb your pleasure. Mr. Comer will take care of you," and she was gone before I could say a thing. SOME fellow swung me off in a Virginia reel and it was then that the accident happened. He caught his finger in one of my unfinished buttonholes and made a rip in my basque. I grabbed it and held it together while I ran for my coat. When Henry asked if I wanted to go home, [T had no choice but to go with him, bad as he had treated me. All the way home all he'd sav was. "Yes." "Wiel" "No." When he got out to lift me down 242 from the sleigh I asked him pointblank what had come over him. He said, "Miss Lowham, there is truth and there isa lie. One is good and the other is bad, and a man lives by his choice of the two. It's like a fork in the road. You can take the one on the right or the one on the left, but there is no middle way." He climbed into the sleigh and drove off without a glance at me, and I stood there in the path, realizing now why Melissa had been bossing Henry around all night. They had come together and he had been standing in the shadow when Melissa stood in the light. He had seen and heard the whole show I had put on over Eph and had seen through it. I just stood and wondered how much shame and misery a_ heart could hold and still beat, and then I turned and went into the house. One thing I gained, I was rid of Eph. Melissa took care of him for me for life. They were married the very next month with a big reception and everything. Henry was at the party, but he might as well have been in Klondike, so great was the coldness and distance in him. I tried to act merry, but I made a sorry mess of it. Father thought that it was losing Eph that kept me low, because he knew nothing about me and Henty. I�ll say this for him, though, he didn't give me one word of censure. Spring came, and the spring dances, and I went with a different fellow every time, but even the dancing had lost its fun. Then the news came about the Comers. David had scarlet fever. Mrs. Comer's niece had got scared and gone home and left Mrs. Comer sick herself and with no help. I told Mother that I was going back, and I went. When I walked into the Comer house everything was at sixes and sevens, dishes piled on the table, floors dirty, beds tumbled, and Mrs. Comer, who was so ill she should have been in bed herself, was fussing over David. "Why, Elvira," she said and lit up with relief. Then her face clouded and she said, "But it's catching, you know, unless you've had it. Have you?" I hurried into the kitchen before she could go into details. For two weeks I was too busy to know that I was alive. The men weren't staying at home, so there weren't the heavy meals and housework to do, but David was very sick, and Mrs. Comer was too weak to help much. The little shaver grew worse and we were afraid that he couldn't pull through. I prayed and prayed, silently, as I worked. My heart ached, and when there wasn't something pressing to be done I went into the kitchen and washed. I washed until there was nothing left with a speck of soil on it, and the time went by. The doctor came every day and I tried to do everything that he ordered as well as a nurse would have done, if we could have found a nurse, and finally David began to improve. The fever went away and he lay, a small white ghost of himself, and my throat ached when I looked into his great dark eyes. "Vira," he'd say, "tell me a tory." And I told him all the wee-wee stories I knew and made up others. When I'd say, "I don't know any more, David," he'd say, "Shing to me then." And I'd sing even when the deep notes came out more like sobs. And when his appetite was so  light that it wouldn't fit a hummingbird, Fd p lay imaginary games with him. The day that I felt certain that he was safe, I went into my room and cried as I had never dared to cry before. Soon, both the mother and child were well and I wasn't needed any longer, and I went home. I was feeling sort of queer. The next morning I had a sore throat and it got more and more raw, and I became very ill. I don't know which hurt worse, my throat or the knowledge that now Henry would know that I had taken the wrong road ag a in. I hadn�t and scarlet fever, but I had it now. I w as so miserable that I wanted to die, but I began to get well disappointingly soon. One day, when I had recovered completely, I was out in the back yard washing clothes when mother came to the back door and called, "There's a young man to see you, Elvira." I shook my hands out of the water and didn't even stop to roll down my sleeves or slick up my hair as I passed the kitchen mirror. What did it matter? It was only one of the town boys after a date for the week-end dance. I strode into the parlor, and stopped dead still and pulled frantically at my sleeves. There stood Henry. "Oh! It's you," I said and made such an effort not to show surprise that the words came out flat, as if my whole life wasn't standing there by the parlor door, and yet completely out of my reach. Henry fidgeted and looked at his hat twirling round and round on his fist. He almost looked at me once, but dropped his eyes quickly, and finally he said, "I've come to apologize." "What for?" I blurted. Henry looked up from his hat, but his glance fell again to the copper toes of my work shoes. At last the words came in a rush, "I said, once, that there is truth, and there is a lie. One is good and the other is bad and a man lives by his choice of the two. I claimed that there was no middle road, and I didn't expect to think different, ever. But I know now that I didn't have the whole truth. Nothing is bad that saves a life." He gulped. I felt so sorry for him that I stepped closer. His fingers reached out and tightened and he drew me to him. "Oh, Elvira," he said, "we've wasted so much time!" My lips touched his cheek and I tasted tears; I couldn't tell whether they were mine or Henry's. It didn't matter. Everything was all right now, and it always would be. 244 THE MERRILL LOCUST TREE Rebecca Merrill Ostler My thoughts go back to the little house Of long remembered days, In dear simplicity it stood With unpretentious ways; And yet it was a restful place, Beneath the locust's shade, The spreading branches guarded well The home my parents made. I long for that old locust tree And for the birds to sing  My father often rested there In early days of spring. He brought the seed from old Nauvoo In the pioneer wagon train And planted it deep in the desert soil When he found a home again; The tall old tree brings memories More dear than I can tell  Long may the locust lend its shade To the home we loved so well.
