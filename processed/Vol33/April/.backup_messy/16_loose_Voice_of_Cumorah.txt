VOICE OF CUMORAH Jo Adelaide Stock I am a hill of stone and clay, Of grass and tree; A sacred record, ancient, lay Hidden in me! The earth which long my treasure kept Is holy earth; Within my bosom close it slept Until its birth. To me a righteous prophet gave The work of years; To keep, to cherish and to save Through trial and tears! I've felt the blessed holy tread Of Angels' feet! I heard the words Moroni said, And oh, how sweet! Call me thrice blessed! Hark to mel Reward is mine! To every saint o'er land and sea I am a shrine! NOTES TO THE FIELD 253
