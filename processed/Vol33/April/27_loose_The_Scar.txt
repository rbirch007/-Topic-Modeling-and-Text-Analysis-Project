The Scar Martha Robeson Wright R. Bowen's hand was gentle on her arm, though his voice was firm. "It could be much worse, you know, Rowena. It's a clean scar; no infection, and it's on the side of your face." Rowena Marshall sat stiff and upright in her chair. Her left hand was moving on her face, following the ridge from the left temple down to her neck. "It isn't fair to have such a scar, just from tripping over a rug. If only that vase hadn't been there. I was always going to get rid of that big ugly thing." "That's the way it is, sometimes," the doctor said. "You musn't worry too much. You know, Rowena, most women would consider themselves lucky to be as good looking as you are, right now, scar included. Well there's nothing more I can do for you. I'll be on my way." "You you really think a plastic surgeon could take this away?" The doctor closed his bag with a snap. "Absolutely. But it takes a lot of money these days if you can find a good man who isn't busy patching up the wounded soldiers. Goodbye, Rowena." "Goodbye, Dr. Bowen," she answered dully and allowed him to let himself out of the apartment. When the door closed behind him, Rowena buried her face in her hands. Tears ran through her fingers. Then, as if on puppet strings, she jerkily took her handkerchief from her pocket and dabbed at her eyes. She arose woodenly from her chair and walked to the large oval mirror that hung on the west wall of the pleasantly furnished living room. Her glossy black hair had not begun to whiten. Her large, deep, violet-blue eyes were as flashing as ever, with brows like blackbirds' wings. Long thick lashes threw shadows on her cheeks. Rowena turned her head, first one side to the mirror and then the other. If people could see only the right side of her face, they would not see the scar. But, on the left side, they would see the thin, but rough and jagged line that stood out in contrast against the fine whiteness of her skin, the lovely ears, the classic outline of her jaw. Without the scar, she was lovely. People on the street always turned to watch her. Now they would tum to stare at the scar! Don would have felt sorry for her, but he would have had more sympathy for himself. She could almost see his handsome face with its golden curls, a huge, blond viking of a man with all the charm and arrogance of a young god, laughing over her shoulder. He loved perfection in everything. "You are beautiful, gorgeous! We belong together. Two perfect specimens," he had always said. When he was in the right mood he was the most thrilling man Rowena had ever known. But he was too mercurial to remain in one temperament for long, and the sudden changes Page 275  276 were extremely trying to her emotions. He would be just as dramatic in his penitence as in his anger. THEN, it seemed to Rowena, that Don's personality faded from the mirror, and Basil came into view. Basil, with his kind heart and his patched-up face that showed the patches only when he smiled. Dear Basil. He understood how she felt about her scar. He would never be chagrined because she was not a perfect specimen now. She was glad that it was Basil who was alive instead of Don, though she had loved Don more than anyone in the world. But she couldn't have borne Don's growing indifference because she wore a flaw. Rowena turned away from the mirror and began pacing the room. There was thankfulness in her heart that she was married to Basil now. He would do anything she asked, no matter what the personal sacrifice might be, to make her happy. He knew what her beauty meant. And she was glad that she had been beautiful, for she felt that such loveliness had procured for her everything she had felt worth having in life. Rowena could remember the first time Don had brought Basil home with him. She and Don had just returned to town from their honeymoon. Basil hadn't known Don was married. Don had insisted that his old friend come home with him to dinner and to meet his lovely bride. Rowena had been shocked almost beyond good manners when she saw the left side of Basil's face when he smiled. It hadn't been noticeable when his features were in repose. All that evening she had managed to keep her eyes away from the disfigurement. She noticed that Basil always tried to have this unmarred side toward her. When Basil had gone she had asked Don about the scar. "If you must know the truth, my precious, that is the man who saved my life. I might have been the one with the false jaw and the grafted skin. I never could have stood it. I�d have committed suicide. Thank goodness, it's only noticeable on him when he smiles." "Poor thing. He's the kind of a man who has a smiling disposition, too. He rescued you and paid that price? Oh, Don, you owe him such a debt." Don had fidgeted impatiently. "Yes, my dear. He was a hero. He is my best friend. But I hadn't seen him in fifteen years. He was in the hospital and went through so many operations. He sort of kept to himself." "T like him, Don. He is sweet and kind. And very lonely." "Good! We'll be the Three Musketeers." They had been. 'Three good friends until the day Don died; both Rowena and Basil balance wheels for the effervescent Don. Don had been a petulant and exacting patient. He left Rowena with two little boys and no money. His illness had taken everything, and the life insurance went to pay accumulated bills. Rowena stopped her pacing by the living room windows to look out and see the cold bleakness outside. It was on just such a day that Basil had asked her to marry him. It had surprised her. It had never occurred to her that he would have the temerity to think that she would marry him. THE SCAR It presented a way out of her difficulties. Basil would be a good father to the children, and he loved her. She knew that if she hadn't been beautiful he would not have asked her to marry him. He didn't expect too much of her. He had said, "I know it couldn't be like it was with Don; but we aren't youngsters now. I want to take care of you and the boys." He had taken care of them. Her life with Basil had become sweet, peaceful, gracious. She had never known such a quiet happiness. The boys were grown now, and in college trying to complete their studies before being called into the army. Basil had been successful in business, though now things were becoming a bit difficult. He gave her everything she wanted. His sympathy over her accident had given her the courage to face things. He said very little; it hadn't been necessary. It was all there in his gentle eyes. He would think of some way that would enable them to get the money for a plastic operation. She would have to ask him more about it when he came home. The sound of a key in the latch caused Rowena to turn from the window. "Anybody home?" called Basil from the front hall. She hurriedly replaced her handkerchief, and pushed back her hair. "In the living room," she said. Basil came in, his cheeks red with the cold. He looked happy. "You're home early." He took her hands. News. Want to hear it?" "Of course." ""Let's sit down." He led her to the sofa, and sat down, as he always did, automatically 277 so she could see the right side of his face. Only now, he could see the left side of her face. "I've managed to get some money to have that scar taken away. Dr. Condon, the best in the world, is here at the Veteran's Hospital doing some special work. He'll do it." She sat quite still. "Basil, it would take an awful lot of money." "I have five thousand dollars." Her eyes filled with tears. "Oh, Basil, you are wonderful!" "I�ll want my wife to be happy," he said softly. "I I suppose men take things differently. Your face I I suppose you have become so accustomed to it that you forget you have the scar." He did not speak for a moment. Then he shrugged his shoulders. "My face doesn't matter. I've never been beautiful." ROWENA sat stunned. In a flash she knew what she had never been sensitive enough to realize before. Basil had never become accustomed to his disfigurement. He had gone through his first realizations of things just as she had done. He might not have been beautiful, but that was not the point. Feeling the pity of his friends and family as they tried to appear casual about his scar must have been torture. But Basil's scar had taught him tolerance, understanding, and kindness. Her scar had taught her nothing but self-pity. Basil's deep, quiet philosophy of life, she realized, had been the background of her happiness. Her life with Basil, from her point of view, had been based on a compassionate tolerance of his affection, like that of a beauty for one who worships at her shrine. 278 Basil had been a much better father to her sons than Don would have been. They had called him Uncle Basil at first, but it soon became shortened to Basil. Then, no one knew exactly when, he had become "Dad." Rowena knew she had been a good wife. She had never given herself to him unreservedly; but he hadn't expected her to. He had said so. He had been happy to bask in the warmth of her lovely graciousness, a family man with a hearth to warm his toes and the children's laughter to warm his heart. It came to her now, in this moment of self-revelation, that she had never tried to understand his real feelings. His one thought, and hers, had been for her happiness. She knew now what she wanted to do. Basil put his hand in hers as it rested on the cushion of the sofa. "Aren't you happy?" She curled her fingers inside of his but did not look at him. "S-suppose I didn't want the operation?" she said softly. His hand convulsed quickly over hers. "It's all right. I have the money. We won't go into debt. I know, you see, how it feels to be marred. You're so lovely, I couldn't bear to see you so hurt." "T'm not so lovely with the scar, I know. But I think I'll keep it. To keep me humble. It may grow fainter after awhile. Unless unless you feel that it spoils my appearance too much. I know most men marry first with their eyes." He released her hand and stood, facing her. "Your scar doesn't matter to me. Did you think I married you because you were beautiful? Haven't you realized what a contrast we make? I loved you for your gallant spirit with Don, your kindness to me. And, I knew Don's nature much better than you. You you and the boys have given me the most wonderful years a man ever had. These are the things that count. Beautiful faces grow just as old and wrinkled as the plain ones." Rowena arose to face him, her eyes level with his. Her arms went around his neck. As he began to understand her, a flush of happiness spread over his face. His eyes were illumined by what he saw in her eyes. She kissed him. On the left side of his face. SPRING Beatrice K.

MESSAGES FROM THE MISSIONS (Continued) New England Mission, Concord Branch (New Hampshire) FROM the New England Mission where Sister Bertha S. Reeder is President of the Relief Society, the following communication has been received from the Concord Branch through Sister Donna S. Fletcher, President: "I understand that with the establishment of this Relief Society, that now we have a Relief Society in every state in the Union. Even though New Hampshire was the last state to have a Relief Society, I feel that our little group has made great progress in its year of organization. "We hold meetings every Tuesday. Every member except myself is a convert to the Church. Sometimes our members are few, as the NEW ENGLAND MISSION, CONCORD (NEW HAMPSHIRE) BRANCH RELIEF SOCIETY Left to right: Violet and Edna Jessman, Lela Hammond, Stella Jessman; Jennie Anderson, First Counselor; Donna S.

Page 279 heavy snowstorms and distance of travel make it impossible for everyone to attend regularly. "Last year we made a quilt and sent it, along with many bundles of clothing, to the New England mission home. My husband and I, as natives of Utah, are greatly enjoying our work in the Church in Concord. We feel it a privilege to be able to have so many wonderful people with whom to associate. May God bless Thefor the fine service it renders." Southern States Mission EFFIE MEEKS, Relief society President, Southern States Mission, writes under date of October 20, 1945: "We are happy to get back to work after such an inspiring conference. I feel now as if I might be able to do double duty, and in fact, we have had it to do since we came back. Work really piles up when one is away for awhile. "Enclosed is the picture of the pillowcases which I promised to send you. These were all made from feed sacks and the women drew their own designs. They were made by the Sylacauga Branch in Alabama. In order to bleach the lettering from the sacks they are soaked in bleaching solutions, 'following directions on the package. "The Georgia District started a cookbook several years ago by gathering favorite recipes from people in their district and also from all mission president's wives that have been in the South. The book has never been completed and now I have an idea that I would like to suggest to them, that we encourage all the women of the Mission to contribute their favorite recipes and make it a real Southern State's cookbook." Danish Mission THE following excerpts from a letter written to Second Counselor Gertrude R. Garff from Sister Eva Gregersen of the Danish Mission will prove of interest to Relief Society members everywhere: "President Benson and two other American elders here were supposed to arrive tomorrow, Saturday, and stay over Sunday. Suddenly my husband came running home and told me that they had arrived unexpectedly and that President West was not at home until later, so we had better go down to the mission home and help entertain them until President West came. "Oh, what a lovely time we had! The new apostle seems to be a very wonderful man. I was just thrilled to sit and listen to him. It was just like the good old days to have Americans around again. I am sure we will have some wonderful meetings on Sunday. "We have had many people out to the meetings lately. One of the reasons, I am sure, is that we have received these wonderful gifts from you, our dear friends of the United States. We have all received something. Especially am I happy for the wonderful blanket and the good quilt. Every member has received some kind of blanket or quilt, and I can tell you that it is badly needed. Ole [her son] got a nice pair of pants. It is his only pair. To say that we are thankful is putting it mildly, overwhelmed is the better word."

Photograph submitted by Effie Meeks, President Southern States Mission Relief Society. 282 Samoan Mission j= OQ. ADAMS, President of the Samoan Mission, reports an interesting activity in the islands: "Annually, in Samoa, the Relief Society goes over the mission with a fine-tooth comb inspecting, scrutinizing, pondering, suggesting, commending, condemning, judging, and even fining! It is a procedure effected in the spirit of kindness and the genuine desire to help raise the standards of the family, and hence of the Church as well. May we briefly follow such a group? "Relief Society officers and members of all ages are arranged in groups convenient in size and in proximity to the field to be inspected. The date is fixed so that each district knows when to expect the going over. "I saw one group in very efficient jovial operation at Pesega Mission headquarters. How the dozen keen eyed sisters, all faultlessly gowned, chuckled when one of them hoisted an office chair on our desk and found dust on its underside! They went over our spacious domicile from cellar to garret then ended up with the proverbial singing and dancing that make Samoa what it is a land of music, rhythm, and joy. "Where I have observed the plan in operation, it produces good results. Each family gets out all its dishes, utensils, bedding, mats, pillows, sheets, blankets, clothing, etc. All are expected to be clean, mended, and usable. First, the visiting party all bathe and change into clean clothes, and have the customary greetings of speeches, etc. It is the custom to give the people being visited crackers and cocoa. Then, the work is begun. A scrutinizing peep  or more than a peep is taken of the house and its contents and surroundings. If all is up to requirements, all well and good, the family receives commendation. If not, kindly and constructive criticism and suggestions are made, and the family may even be fined a few shillings, which goes into the Relief Society fund. "A house of a certain size requires a certain number of coarse floor mats, with better ones covering them, as the pebble floor would soon ruin the finer top ones. The same applies to fine beautiful bed mats. The woven shutters, which are always raised high unless it is raining hard, are part of the requirements. Pillows are filled with the native 'tree' cotton. Many families have mattresses made of this cotton and it serves well. The sisters also work beautiful designs on pillowcases in colored thread, also, on bedspreads, doilies, etc. There must be enough of everything to make the home comfortable for all its occupants enough mosquito nets, for instance. If the house leaks, renovation is pointed out as a pressing need. If the ground about the house is littered or weedy (and it seldom is in Samoa), pressure is brought to bear to have it cleaned. If cooking utensils and dishes are insufficient, getting some cheap ones is recommended. In no case are hardships imposed upon anyone, for almost any native can cut, dry, and sell enough coconuts to buy these necessities and comforts. "So these middle-aged and older Relief Society sisters of Samoa, with their unique, consistent and_ thorough system of encouraging their members to maintain model homes and surroundings, are pioneers in NOTES FROM THE FIELD 283 what might well be followed else what might well be followed elsewhere. Many a home in the U.S.A. would not pass inspection in Samoa!" Northwestern States Mission Coos Bay (Oregon) Branch MARTHA HUNT, President of Coos Bay Branch (Oregon) Relief Society, describes an unusually successful food sale and bazaar: 'In the southwestern corner of Oregon, on Coos Bay, nine Relief Society sisters have just held their annual bazaar and cooked food sale. These women put in long hours of work to make it a success and saved their sugar throughout the year, bit by bit, so as to make cakes, cookies and candies. Some of the members donated sugar and others took the time to prepare cakes, etc. Materials were scarce here this year, as everywhere, and a strike was in progress, but the fancy work and foodstuffs 'came forth' when bazaar time rolled around. "The receipts this year were around $160, of which $100 was given toward a building fund for a chapel in this branch. Plates and bowls were also purchased for use at annual dinners and Sunday School parties. "Our women have a motto: 'There is no task too big for the Coos Bay Relief Society.'

TANNER, President of the Juneau (Alaska) Branch Relief Society, describes a sacrament meeting program and other interesting activities: "March 4th (1945) the branch presidency gave the time in sacrament meeting allotted to speakers to the Relief Society. We carried out the program suggested in the Bulletin as closely as possible for our small group. The dialogue, all the talks, and: most of the musical selections were given. We enjoyed preparing and carrying out this program which was acclaimed as very interesting by the audience. "For further commemoration, on March 8th, our business and social evening, we prepared a special luncheon for our group and spent the evening sewing and relating reasons for our interest in Relief Society and the great need we have for the association and the uplift and knowledge we receive from the activities." Northwestern States Mission Buckley (Washington) Branch NORA SMITH, President of Buckley Branch Relief Society, reports on a very successful bazaar: "The Relief Society bazaar and bake sale of the Buckley Branch of the Northwestern States mission was held December 5, 1945, in the Relief Society rooms of our church and was very successful. The members began preparing for the bazaar immediately following the New Year and worked willingly and diligently all through the regular year, as well NORTHWESTERN STATES MISSION JUNEAU (ALASKA) BRANCH RELIEF SOCIETY Back row, standing, left to right: Margaret Skinner, Trudy Nielsen, Ruth Bost, Doris Clift, Doris McClellan, Ethel Westfall, Norrine Kunz.
