RETURN OF SPRING Olive M. Nicholes Orion waves his jewelled sword on high And marches onward with the frosty stars; Fair Venus rises in the evening mists And hangs her lantern in the April sky. The crocus stirs beneath the frozen clod, The river slips its crystal barricade; The warm earth stirs and lives and breathes again And pours its bounty in the hands of God. The pale narcissus blooms in dappled shade, Blue violets embroider woodland trails; Among the pussy willows by the brook The veery flutes his vernal serenade. Why should I tremble when the planets swing Their sure, celestial pathway through the stars, When blighted gardens and the frozen hills Pass on to blaze a trail for fragrant spring? Though mankind barters for his brother's soul  This do I know, if all the world forgets, That the eternal mind of man shall move With certitude, unhurried to its goal. The Cover: "Desert Roses" from a photograph by Dr. Walter P. Cottam VOL. 33, NO. 4 APRIL 1946 "ON THE WAY To EMMAUs" Tom a Painting by Plockhorst "
