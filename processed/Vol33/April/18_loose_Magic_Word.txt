Magic Word m Mary Ek Knowles WHEN at last she reached the foot of the tortuous path, the woman sank exhausted to the ground, A moment she lay there, her labored breathing coming from fever-cracked lips, the pain and weariness of her body almost more than she could bear. Then she raised her head and looked back up the dark way from whence she had come, and bewilderment seized her. Ere was she? Why was she here? All about her was darkness heavy, crushing She began to whimper as a child does when it awakens from a nightmare, and she closed her eyes and her head sang again to the ground. A familiar voice came to her echoing and re-echoing down the dark chasm. "Come back! Come back to me!" The woman recognized her mother's voice; and, at the sound, all the laughing carefree days of child- "Yes, yes, Mother!" to cry eagerly. "I am coming back." But she could not open her lips, could not move her tired body. Drowsiness her a drowsiness that numbed her senses and With difficult through a silvery mist, was a peaceful, green countryside with a cool stream winding lazily through a lush meadow. She had but to cross a small bridge and she would be in this coo] Paradise. Slowly she pulled her body over the hard ground toward the bridge, and one hand teached up and clung to the narrow railing. Again a dear voice called to her: "Come back! Come back to me!" It was the voice of her husband. The woman's head went up. Oh, she must go back! Somehow she must drag herself back up that steep Path. Her lips formed the word, "Coming!" Desperately she tried, but she could not rise, could not make her body do her will, And she was tired SO very, very tired. Suddenly, walked across the bridge she would become as strong and carefree as the child who had once raced through and rest peace such as she had never known, She raised herself up and put one foot on the bridge, As she did S0, a child's voice came to her. "Mother! Mother!" it called.   mother turned her head, and her body straightened. It was as "if the magic word, "Mother," had tapped a hidden spring of strength. Without hesitation, she turned her back on Paradise and started to climb the long, stony path to earth. Page 255
