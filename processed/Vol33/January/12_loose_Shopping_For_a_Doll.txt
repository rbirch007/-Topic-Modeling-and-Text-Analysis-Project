SHOPPING FOR A DOLL Hazel Jones Owen I started out early to shop for a doll? It must be the dearest and sweetest of all. I searched every store, seeking my prize, But I couldn't decide on the color of eyes. And should it have golden or dark brown hair? (What kind of clothes, I didn't much care) Should each little cheek have a dimple in? Or should it have one dimple just in its chin? I wearied of searching and looking about, And quite faint heartedly went home without The doll I so eagerly set out to find Because I just couldn't make up my mind. That night as I sat by her wee little bed, A faint light shining on her tousled head, I wondered, dear Lord, did you have such a time In choosing this loveliest baby of mine?
