PROMISE Christie Lund Coles The world will go on much the same When I am gone, The night will come as stealthily As will the dawn. The silver evening, hushed and still, Will be as sweet, And children's laughter will resound Along the street; But this awareness, wild in me, As wind or bird, This sense of being, will it lie With flesh, interred, Within the earth that it has loved, Beneath the sky That its proud heart could circumvent, Must, must it die? The spring in splendor will return The bud, the leaf, I, too, will be aware again Beyond all grief. Fruitful?more spiritually uplifting. Intelligent, more those who will follow our trails that lead by our doors.
