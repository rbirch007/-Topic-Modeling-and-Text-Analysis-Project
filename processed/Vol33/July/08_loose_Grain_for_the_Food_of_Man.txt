Grain for the Food of Man Eva Willes Wangsgaard HAT is earth's loveliest fragrance. According to a sailor who occupied our blue room during his interim between Farragut Naval Training Station and Harvard, it is the smell of baking bread.. A French baker spends many months learning the art of breadmaking, yet, with all our modern advantages, it is an art that any willing housewife can learn and derive a rich satisfaction in its practice. It is a comfortable feeling to know that there is good bread in the breadbox and fresh milk in the refrigerator. Cereal grains have been cultivated since early times. Among the Greeks and Romans, the cultivation of grain was a highly developed art. Such industry encouraged the settlement of towns, since grain is a food easily stored, and, without stored food, people lived as nomads following the game they used as food, or moving to better pastures for their sheep and cattle. The earliest cultivated grains were barley, wheat, and millet. Oats and rye came relatively late in man's development. Women took part in the farming and grinding as well as the breadmaking. Breadmaking has come a long way since the primitive peoples stored grain in crude, earthen jars and ate it raw or parched, or ground it into a coarse meal which they mixed with water and pressed into flat cakes which were dried in the sun or baked in the ashes. Such food has been Page 454 found among the ruins of the old Swiss lake dwellers and in the Egyptian tombs. Some people leavened _ their bread as long ago as 4,000 years. Their yeast was derived from air borne yeast spores. In the making of flour, the Romans progressed to the use of circular mills or querns operated by slave labor or beasts of burden. They also produced several grades of flour by means of sieving or bolting. Later, water wheels were used. The first querns were conical in shape, but were gradually changed to flattened stones, and these continued in general use throughout Europe and this country until 1870. With the advent of steam power and electric power, revolving pairs of rollers were invented and came into general use. This made possible the release of more of the floury kernel unmixed with fine bran and the germ, because of the more gradual breaking of the grains. Roller milling enabled the millers, especially of our Middle West, to make hard wheat into high quality flours. The milling of soft wheats, largely used for cake and pastry flours, was also improved by this process. And so these ancient arts of handling grain as part of the household tasks have developed into a highly technical modern industry. Maize, or Indian corn, sometimes called field corn, is considered native to the Americas. Traces of this grain have been unearthed in ancient Peruvian tombs, and the Indians in GRAIN FOR THE FOOD OF MAN many parts of the two continents cultivated it extensively. Our Pilgrim Fathers would have starved had they not been taught the virtues of corn as a food and been helped in its cultivation by the Indians of New England. Over one-half of the world's cultivated land is used for growing grain of one species or another. About four fifths of the earth's inhabitants prefer wheat or rice because these cereals are palatable, mild in flavor, and blend most successfully with other foods. Only for occasional use are the grains of stronger flavor, such as corn and rye; or they are used by peoples who have these grains in abundance, and to whom the more palatable ones are unavailable. The study of breadmaking is of no slight importance, and deserves more attention than it receives. Considering its great value, it is unnecessary, and even wrong, to find poor bread on any table. Wheat flour is best adapted for breadmaking as it contains gluten in the proper proportion to make the spongy dough necessary to retain the gas bubbles which create its lightness. Except for its slight deficiency in fat, wheat bread is a perfect food. It is this deficiency which led to the spreading of butter on our bread. Next to wheat flour, rye has the necessary gluten, but it is better used in combination with wheat flour. Corn, also, may be used in such combination. BREAD is made by mixing flour to a dough with a quantity of milk, or water and milk, or just water, along with salt and yeast. Sugar is often added to speed the rising. The mixture is kneaded until all 455 ingredients are blended into a smooth, resilient dough. Here is my stand-by recipe, which, if followed carefully, will produce bread of good texture and appetizing flavor. Yeast Bread 2 sifters all-purpose flour (sifted before measuring ), 1 qt. Whole milk, scalded and allowed to cool to tepid 2 tablespoons salt Ye cup sugar 1/8 Ib. Shortening 2 cakes brewer's yeast. Dissolve yeast in the warm milk into which the sugar has been stirred. It will tise and form a foamy mass on top. Sift salt and flour into a large bread pan and stir in the liquid gradually until all the flour has been moistened. Then knead until smooth and even. Well-kneaded dough will not stick to the pan unless it is allowed to become too warm. Cover, and wrap in a large dish towel or other cloth to help keep an even temperature. Stand the pan in a corner protected from drafts. It should double its bulk in three hours. If it is inconvenient to handle at this point, a little longer rising will not spoil the results. Push down and knead again thoroughly. This breaks up the bubbles and distributes the carbon dioxide evenly. Let rise again until double in bulk, about one hour. Push down, divide into three equal portions, mold carefully into loaves of uniform shape and size, place in well-greased loaf tins and set in protected place to rise. This time it must be watched carefully to prevent over rising which spoils the appearance and quality of the loaves and slices. While it rises, preheat the oven to 420?. When the loaves have risen even with the top of the loaf tins, or just below, place in the oven, turn the temperature to 375 or 400, and bake fifty minutes or one hour, depending upon the size of the loaves. This process may be considerably shortened by using more yeast, and the yeast cakes now available may be used without imparting an unsavory, yeasty taste to the bread. Also, the second rising may be omitted, but the handling of bread is 456 like the rearing of a child, if you want the finest results, don't try to hurry the process. This recipe may be used for the making of whole-wheat bread by substituting whole-wheat flour for half of the all-purpose flour. Also, brown sugar or molasses or honey may be used instead of white sugar in whole-wheat bread. Corn meal may be used for part of the flour, also, but since com has very little gluten, it should never exceed one third of the bulk. Raisins or finely chopped nuts may be kneaded into the dough either at the first kneading or, if only one loaf of "fancy" bread is desired, the fruit or nuts may be kneaded into the loaf at the time of molding. This takes time and patience, though, to get the materials evenly distributed in the resilient mixture. Part of the dough may be reserved for rolls, either plain or sweet. Roll the dough flat and cut with a biscuit cutter. Divide each biscuit partially by pressing the back of the knife across the middle of the dough. Put a spot of shortening on one half and fold the other over, pressing the edges firmly. Place on baking sheet to rise and put a cloth over the dough. If sweet rolls are desired, spread the rolled dough with shortening and sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon. Roll up like a blind and slice. Lay the slices on a baking sheet and Jet rise. These take longer in the rising than either bread or plain rolls. Rolls of both types should be baked in a hotter oven than that used for bread, 375 to 400 F. Before rolling, the dough for sweet rolls may be enriched by kneading a beaten egg into it, but the rolls are quite satisfactory without. Also, excellent bread may be made with warm water instead of milk, or with potato water, or with a liquid of half milk and half water, and without the use of shortening. However, if no shortening is used, a soft crust may be obtained by brushing the loaves with butter about ten minutes before removal from the oven. Golden Corn Bread 3/4 cup corn meal 11/4 cup flour 1/2 cup sugar 5 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 cup milk 1egg 1 or 2 tablespoons melted shortening Mix and sift dry ingredients; add milk, egg, well-beaten, and shortening. Bake in shallow greased pan in hot oven (400? F.) twenty minutes. Corn Bread (sweetened with molasses) 1 cup corn meal ?% cup flour 3/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup molasses 3/4 cup milk 1 beaten egg 1 tablespoon melted shortening Mix and bake as for Golden Corn Bread. Now, when famine conditions prevail over much of the world, when a large part of American wheat must be exported, it is more important than ever that we waste no cereals of any kind and that we use such substitutes as corn meal and other available cereals. About one-third mashed potatoes may be substituted for part of the flour in standard recipes.
