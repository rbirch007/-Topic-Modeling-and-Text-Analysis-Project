Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent July 1 and July 15, 1886 For THE RIGHTS OF THE Women OF ZION AND THE Rights OF THE WOMEN or ALL NATIONS ETHICS OF WOMAN'S REST: Let every woman who finds her vital forces failing, who is growing nervous, whose chief longing is for rest of mind and body, who begins to feel that life is not worth the living, stop now and here. Cut off all expenditure of effort that is not an absolute necessity, and curtail that necessity as much as possible.... Remember this: It is important that you should keep a reserve of physical power on hand for future draughts, as that you should provide in a financial way for sickness, accidents, and declining years. ?Emily Bouton * * * *% TRUTHFUL REASONINGS: God, our Heavenly Father, is the great law giver or ruler over this planet. He has declared himself Lord of lords and King of kings. He at various periods of time has dethroned kings and mighty governments, and wrought marvelous changes in the destinies of nations. God has chosen agents to usher in His dispensations and decrees; but He is just, and before He takes an action to accomplish His purposes He holds out offers of mercy and salvation, and pleads with His children for many years. M. A. M. Pratt FROM TEBBSDALE, UTAH: We have a Relief Society organized here, presided over by Sister Hannah LeFevre, and though few in numbers, we consider it a pleasure as well as a duty to meet together in the interest of woman's rights and privileges, to exchange ideas and sentiments, and thus cultivate our minds and enlarge our abilities.... We take the Exponent and learn from it the spirit of the times and the advancement of woman, and we are deeply interested in the instruction it contains.... The most of us have large families and the consequent duties engross most of our time; having our clothing neat but plain, our food simple but wholesome and appetizing, we would be enabled to spare a little time in which to devote to intellectual pleasures. Susie Tebbs, Secretary of Relief Society OUR OWN NATAL DAY All hail! To the Flag of our Country Afloat in the soft summer air, A chord in the heart of each patriot Is touched by this emblem so fair. Mary A. Farnsworth  CROWING OLD: Oh, you who are young, rejoice in your springtime of life. Not alone for its butterflies and breezes, but for its golden opportunities to prepare for a bountiful harvest when autumn shall come. Twine your rosy garlands and forbid not your light feet to dance and your dewy lips to sing in thankfulness for your happy lot. But take heed that you do not blindly follow pleasure regardless of duty. - - - Write it down in the sealed book that there ls no more conclusive testimony to a wasted life than repinings over vanished youth, nor any truer record of a wise and well-spent life than cheerfully, gracefully growing old.
