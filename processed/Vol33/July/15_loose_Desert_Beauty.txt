DESERT BEAUTY Ethel VanHook Hopper Driving through a desert town Where growing things were scorched and brown, I saw beside a heaped-up load Of sagebrush on a dusty road, A woman in the heat and glare, With faded dress and wind-blown hair; She clutched white blossoms in her hand? Where had she found in this bare land Such beauty? Could the desert give These flowers that helped her soul to live I smiled she glanced with pleased surprise; What gratitude in those pale eyes! E} DEPARTMENT Suggestions and Instructions on the Educational Program?1946-47 COURSES for the coming educational year, 1946-47, October through May, are as follows: Theology ? "Church History" (Third and final year). Visiting Teachers' Messages  "Our Pioneer Heritage: Pioneer Virtues." Sewing A course in the fundamentals of sewing, optional for use by wards and branches. (See "Notes to the Field," page 450 of this issue of the Magazine for instructions to Relief Society officers. ) Literature America as Revealed in Its Literature." Optional Lessons in Lieu of Literature The Gospel as a Way of Life." (Instructions concerning the selection of one or the other of these two courses for the third Tuesday of each month may be found in "Notes to the Field," page 450 of this issue of the Magazine.) Social Science �The Family in the Gospel Plan." The aim of the courses to be given in Relief Society during the season 1946-47 is to make Relief Society members better Latter-day Saints, better mothers, and better citizens; and thus to strengthen the Latter-day Saint home. In order to accomplish these purposes, the General Board Page 472 presents lessons on Church doctrine; lessons in literature to interpret America as a land of freedom, calling attention to the need of upholding the Constitution of our land; lessons on fundamental concepts of Latter-day Saint family life; and simple lessons on sewing. The General Board feels that the diligent study of these various courses will give to Relief Society members a well-rounded development in matters essential to Latter-day Saint women in this day. Teaching in Relief Society Depending upon the skill of the teacher, many and varied methods of conducting a class period may be followed. All Relief Society teachers are not equally trained in teaching, and many fine teachers have not had professional training. The. Best teachers, however, are always eager to improve their methods and make more effective their teaching. It is of paramount importance, however highly skilled a teacher may be, that she teach in the spirit of the gospel and give prayerful and conscientious study to her lessons. In addition, however, to the preparation of the lesson by a teacher, she should present it in such a way as LESSON DEPARTMENT to awaken in the members of her class a wish to study and gain knowledge for themselves. This desired end may be obtained by a variety of methods by class participation either by an informal discussion, questions and answers, or by a more formal presentation such as a round table, panel discussion, etc., or by home study on the part of individual members. It is a great responsibility to undertake to teach a group of fellow Relief Society women. It is also a great privilege. From the hours of intensive study spent in preparation for each Relief Society lesson by a class leader, come intellectual growth and a greater understanding of the gospel. May each class leader in the coming season do her utmost to impart knowledge to her class members, and also awaken in them a desire to study and learn for themselves, so that the testimonies of all Relief Society members may be strengthened, and their lives be lived more in conformity with the principles of the gospel. Lesson titles and lesson aims for the entire year's courses of study are given in the previews, but these may be subject to change. Correspondence on Lessons Ward class leaders who desire help on any matter pertaining to a lesson should consult their stake leaders. Stake leaders desiring information may address such correspondence to General Board of Relief Society, 28 Bishop's Building, Salt Lake City 1, Utah. It is not desirable to address communications either to the authors of the lessons or to any other Church office. 473 Textbooks and Special References Textbooks should be supplied for the use of the respective class leaders from the funds of the Society. On the completion of the courses in May 1947, it is suggested that the counselor in charge of education see that all books bought during the year by Relief Society funds are collected and placed in the Relief Society library for future use. Many books which have been used in Relief Society in past years (such as The American Citizen's Handbook, in use by Relief Societies for the social science lessons in 1942-43, which will supply supplementary material for the literature course "America as Revealed in Its Literature" for 1946- 47) will be found of great worth in preparing the current year's lessons. It is important that books bought by Relief Society through the years be carefully preserved for future reference. Textbooks for courses for the year 1946-47 are as follows: Theology: Doctrine and Covenants, $1.00; Smith, Joseph Fielding: Essentials in Church History, $2.00. Sewing (Optional course for work meeting): The Complete Book of Sewing, Book Presentations, New York, 1943, $2.95.: These textbooks may be obtained from the Deseret Book Company, 44 East South Temple, Salt Lake City 10, Utah. A list of books to which references are made in the current year's lessons, and which will prove of lasting worth in a Relief Society library, follows: Standard Works of the Church Bible Book of Mormon Doctrine and Covenants Pearl of Great Price 474 Books by Latter-day Saint writers on Church subjects, referred to in Relief Society lessons for 1946-47: A Story to Tell, published by Sunday School and Primary (includes pioneer stories) Bowen, Albert E.: Constancy Amid Change Discourses of Brigham Young.

Wayne Driggs Preview of Lessons for 1946-47 A PREVIEW of the third and final year's course of study entitled "Church History" introduces the lessons for 1946-47. 'Titles for the last eight lessons and their objectives follow below. It will be remembered that the central theme for the course is to be found in the Savior's words, "By their fruits ye shall know them." Again we shall look at the fruits of Mormonism and find them good. By way of review we may summarize the three parts of the course once more. Part I for 1944-45 was devoted to the opening dispensation of the fulness of times and had as its objective the mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the coming of the "church out of the wilderness"'; Part II for 1945-46 outlines the story of the saints in their movement to "the place which God prepared" in the tops of the everlasting mountains; Part III for 1946-47 pertains to the coming-of-age period of the Church with its broadened activities meeting the swift sweep of our modern times. The main objective of the course is to narrate the more important events of Church history and to consider the revelations in their relation to the historical episodes. We revere the revelations contained in the book of the Doctrine and Covenant as the revealed word of God for our day. The titles of the eight lessons for this year's course follow: LESSON DEPARTMENT Lesson 17. The Organized Church Moves Forward Objective: To indicate how the expand. Ing functions and offices in the Restored Church developed, Lesson 18. The Priesthood Quorums Expanded: Objective To show how the worthy male membership of the Church is eligible to receive the powers and blessings of the Priesthood. Lesson 19. The Relief Society Developed Objective: To trace the steps which developed an organization to provide for the growth and joy of women in service. Lesson 20, Educational System Developed Objective: Objective: To show that God would have his children seek after all that is good. Lesson 21: More Auxiliary Organization of the Church Started Objective: To study how the Sunday School, the Mutual Improvement Association, and the Primary organization were soon given place to aid in the Church training program for youth. Lesson 22. The Welfare Plan Initiated Objective: To show how the Lord is helping his saints to face the problems of our day. Lesson 23. Unsung Heroes in Zion's Cause Objective: To appreciate the countless unheralded men and women who have stood firm within the Church to move forward the work of the Lord. Lesson 24. Over a Century oi Mormonism Objective: To review, in brief, the ushering in of the last and greatest dispensation� the fulness of times � and to point out what still lies ahead. In this concluding series of the Church history lessons, there will be  need for supplementary reading material in addition to the Doctrine and Covenants and Essentials in Church History, the textbook for his course. Handbooks of instruction for the Priesthood quorums, the Relief Society, the Mutual Improvement and Primary Associations, the Sunday School and the Welfare Plan should be available. These need not be purchased, since copies are always at hand with appointed officers of the auxiliary organizations of the wards and branches of the Church. Do not lose sight of the place of the Doctrine and Covenants in this study. Here, the words you will read are the words of the Lord which ever illuminate the enduring principles of life. Through all the study let us not forget our repeating phrase from lesson to lesson� we must ''give heed unto his word" which has been written especially for us in this day. As to the method of class discussion, bear the following in mind: Somehow, in too many lessons, practically all o f the material is given in the written lesson itself. The teacher covers this part fairly well. When, however, she reaches the discussion period, she poses questions that draw a weak response. To this she must then supplement her own contribution. In overcoming such difficulty, there is the necessity of putting real content into the discussion period. In the case of the present series, this is done by directing class members to the words of the Lord as recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants. Once a class, after attempting to answer a simple but searching question, is turned to the 476 clear and convincing facts as phrased by the Master, hearts are warmed; and minds, seeking ready confirmation of truth, recall personal illustrations which press for expression. Testimonies result, and the teacher assumes her rightful role as director, rather than taskmaster of the hour. Lesson 17 The Organized Church Moves Forward For Tuesday, October 1, 1946 Objective: To indicate how the expanding functions and offices in the restored Church developed. THE might of a great people is measured collectively. Upon the group as a whole, rather than upon its individual members, must the ultimate worth of a cause be known. It has been significant throughout the story of the rise of the Latter-day Saints that the Lord, in speaking of his Church, has always done so in plural terms. The promise given for the keeping of the Word of Wisdom, for example, reads, "And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings..." (Doc. And Cov. 89:18), not, and each saint who keeps these sayings. This is a significant fact both for the development of the Church, as well as for the good of each individual member, ~ for therein lies a strength twofold. By directing his promises for good living to the saints, the Lord, in effect, says, align yourself with my people and their cause, and you may be assured of the ultimate triumph of good. Something happens to one when such a promise is given. Desire to hold fast is strengthened, and within the heart rests the comfort of those eternal values that remain amid a world of change. What better way could God be forever calling his children into line! In our study of Church history the past two years, many and varied have been the shifting scenes that have depicted the rise of a mighty people ? the modern Israel. At times, when the dark clouds of oppression blackened the skies, it must have seemed to those who suffered most in the beginning years, that the promises of the Lord might come to naught. Had it not been for that enduring faith kindled eternally within the hearts of his most stalwart saints, certainly there could have been no rise of a nation of men and women who came from the far corners of the earth to bring again Zion in the last days. But now, as we look back over the history of the Church for a hundred years and more, we must feel that the world, too, will come to realize how great was that first vision of the boy prophet, Joseph Smith, that spring morning in the year of 1820. Yes, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has come of age. No longer need her people rest solely upon the revealed word of the Lord to sustain and defend their cause. Literally, within the lives and deeds of thousands and thousands of worthy saints, there rests the living testimony of a great work. These people are the fruits of the good tree. They are they whose lives become the pattern by which one may know the truth. And now, for those of us who LESSON DEPARTMENT have grown into the grove of good trees of the third, fourth, and even the fifth generation, let us take stock of our rich heritage in order to more fully appreciate the expanding function of the modern restored Church of our day. Its roots are deep, its foundation secure, its plan for the perfecting of the saints certain. Within the years of the more than a century since the first vision of Joseph Smith, many and wonderful have been the accomplishments of the modern Israel. These, if marked off in decades, May suggest, chronologically, some of the more important high lights of the Church events we have been studying during this course in Church history. Considered in connection with Latter-day Saint beliefs, as these have been Stated in the Articles of Faith, the Student of history may see how the guiding principles 20f Mormonism have been translated] into action and accomplishment. 1820?Year of the First Vision God not only spoke from the heavens, but saw fit to appear personally in company with his Only Begotten Son. Years later, the Prophet wrote, "We believe in God the Eternal Father, and in His Son Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost." From the personal know]- edge of sight as well as hearing, Joseph placed with conviction each comma and conjunction in that sentence. God lives! He does speak! He can answer Prayer! He does direct his work to bring about the eternal life of man! Here is the firm foundation upon which the Church of Jesus Christ now rests, 477 1830?Year of Organization of the Church According to the laws of the State of New York and the nation of which it is a part, this religious body came into being. Since that day and as a result of the revelations given to the Prophet, there is upon the earth the same organization "that existed in the Primitive Church viz: apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, etc." 1840 Year of the Incorporation of the City of Nauvoo The most inspiring structure in the mother of Mormon towns Nauvoo the Beautiful was the temple. It was the second such to be erected in the dispensation of the fulness of times, Inspired and blessed by the revelations God had already given his saints in Kirtland, the people of his choice now knew for a certainty the power of "the gift of tongues, Prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues." Everywhere, the peace of beautiful homes and thriving industries made Nauvoo a haven of though, had seen the bitter darkness that lay just ahead for him and his people, even as he then stood radiant in the shafts of sunlight that pierced the thickly darkening clouds. 1850 Year of Territorial Organization of Utah When the Prophet saw in vision the saints as a mighty people in the heart of the Rocky Mountains, he set their thinking toward scriptural 478 fulfillment of the prophecies of Zion redeemed. Later he wrote as the tenth articles of faith, "We believe.. That Zion will be built upon this (the American) continent." President Brigham Young, who led the Church in the beginning days of the fulfillment of these prophecies, saw the need for a new land under the control of democratic, constitutional freedom such as the founding fathers of our nation envisioned. It was with joy, therefore, that he and the saints heralded the news of President Millard Fillmore's appointment of federal officers for the Territory of Utah, in September of 1850. Brigham Young thus became the governor of the Provisional State of Deseret. Zion of the Americas seemed nearer at hand. 1860 Departure of Johnston's Army from Utah The struggle for righteous living among the saints brought bitter opposition in all their journeyings, even to the outposts of civilization? the Rocky Mountains. Tenaciously they stated their right to worship freely as: follows, "We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may." The Johnston's army episode in Utah brought to an end the era of mobs and armed force. The army came to subdue rebellion, and left having found none.. Its departure marked the beginning of brighter days for the Church whose claim for the freedom of worship | still stands. 1870Stakes of Zion Organized (Nine in Number) The coming of the 1870's marked the organization of twenty stakes of Zion. From Bear Lake on the north to St. George on the south, President Young had set firmly these organizations for the Church. "The literal gathering of Israel" was well under way. Within the outer reaches of the Intermountain Empire were planted the secure posts of refuge for the growth and development of the saints. In seven years that followed the opening of this decade, eleven of the twenty stakes were organized, so that, by 1877, the year of Brigham Young's death, men and women from the far corners of the earth knew of the standard upon Zion's hilltop. 1880 Fiftieth Anniversary of the Organization of the Church President John Taylor, in the year of the Golden Jubilee, revived again an old custom of Israel as recorded in the twenty-fourth chapter of the Book of Leviticus. The year was to be one of forgiveness in the Church. Throughout the stakes of Zion the need of service to the less fortunate was stressed. It was a year of thankfulness and praise to the Lord. 1900 Fiftieth Anniversary of the Preaching of the Gospel in Scandinavia and Hawaii. Two oceans had been spanned by the dawning of the twentieth century. The good word of the gospel had gone over both. Truly, the search for honest souls had become world-wide. How real then to the saints became the words of the LESSON DEPARTMENT third article of faith, that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel." 1930 Year of the Centennial Celebration of the Church ? one hundred years of Mormonism was Portrayed in fitting word and song from Salt Lake City to the most remote branches of the mighty People rejoiced - and "hoped all things" for the greater days that lay ahead, Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggested readings given below, have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part of the text to discover wherein we must �give heed unto his word.� 1. Any man who would be truly great must first be humble. As it is with a single man, so it is with people. The great events of the first century of Mormonism came to pass because God found humble men in the world who would listen to his word. What are the  characteristics of t rue humility? Have read again in class, the whole of the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants, and note the parts for discussion which firmly uphold the qualities that have made our people great. 2. What historical events to be found in this lesson stand out for you as an illustration of the greatness of the Latterday Saints? Have members of the class discuss these in the light of the article of faith found therein. For further details of important Church events during the first century of Mormonism, refer to the appendix of Essentials in Church History, by Joseph Fielding Smith. Visiting Teachings� Messages-Our Pioneer Heritage President Amy Brown Lyman Preview of Lessons for 1946-47 "OUR PIONEER HERITAGE" is the general subject chosen for consideration in the Visiting teachers' department during the year 1046-47. Messages featuring pioneer virtues will be dwelt upon and will be discussed by the visiting teachers when making their monthly visits. These messages will be especially timely, appropriate, and interesting during this time� Utah's great centennial year� when the attention of members of the Church everywhere will be focused on the migration of the Latter-day Saints from Nauvoo, the City Beautiful, their trek across the dreary, uncharted plains, their dramatic entrance into their "Land of Promise," and their struggles to colonize a new, parched and barren wilderness. Of this migration the historian Bancroft says: There is no parallel in the world's history to this migration from Nauvoo. The exodus from Egypt was from a heathen land, a land of idolators, to a fertile region designated by the Lord for his chosen people . . . The pilgrim fathers in fleeing to America came from a bigoted people � a people making few pretentions to civil or religious liberty . . . Before this [migration] the Mormons had [already] been driven to the outskirts of civilization, where they had built themselves a city; this they must now abandon, and throw themselves upon the mercy of savages... (Bancroft's History of Utah, page 217). In our discussions and considerations we shall keep in mind, in addition to our 1847 pioneers, those who came in successive companies during the two decades which preceded the completion of the railroad to Salt Lake Valley, and also those other pioneers who settled in the outlying sections of Utah and in the adjoining states, and who demonstrated the same faith and courage, and experienced similar hardships and trials. We shall also remember the brave and courageous women the wives and mothers, whose help, encouragement, and service were mighty factors in all the great triumphs and outstanding successes of those early days. As we think of the accomplishments, the virtues, and the debt of gratitude we owe our own pioneers, we are very naturally reminded that in every phase of human endeavor there have been those who had the vision, the courage, and the daring to look ahead and prepare the way for others to follow. To all such who have made constructive contributions to the welfare of mankind, the whole world is indebted. Among these are those who have so successfully led the way into fields of scientific invention and discovery, who have so greatly advanced conditions of health and education, and who have made mighty progress in the direction of improved human relations. Many of these great leaders have been misunderstood and unappreciated, some have been reviled and persecuted, while still others have been actual martyrs to a cause for which they had already previously sacrificed and suffered. Our ever-faithful visiting teachers will no doubt receive this assignment of subject matter for 1946-47 with great satisfaction and enthusiasm. Like all other Latter-day Saints, they love the stories of the pioneers. With many of these, they may already be familiar. But they will probably enjoy refreshing their memories and searching for further interesting historical data. Incidents connected with the journey and labors of our peerless pioneers will awaken renewed admiration for their faith and courage, their dauntless spirit and fortitude, and will increase in their descendants and all other members of the Church, appreciation for their outstanding virtues and their marvelous, if not actually miraculous, accomplishments. It is hoped that the visiting teachers in carrying these messages to the homes will so stimulate Church members that there will be a revived interest in the lives and labors of the mighty men and women who were such important factors in the establishment of our great Western Empire; and cause Church members to seek to emulate the example set by the pioneers. Titles for the messages for the eight months follow: Lesson 1. Love of God Objective: To show that the pioneers had a fundamental love of God, shown in their simple obedience to the principles of his truth. Lesson 2. Love of Fellow Man Objective: To show that the pioneers LESSON DEPARTMENT possessed the qualities of character necessary to live the "second great commandment," love of neighbor. Lesson 3. Faith Objective: To show that the pioneers recognized and practiced the first principle of revealed religion, namely, faith ?faith in God, faith in their leaders, faith in one another, and faith in a great cause. Lesson 4. Courage Objective: To show that courage, an outstanding virtue, was possessed by the pioneers; not alone courage to meet physical dangers, but also courage to meet spiritual pitfalls. Lesson 5. Industry Objective: To acquaint the women with 48) the diligence and industry of the pioneers. Lesson 6. Self-Reliance Objective: To show that the pioneers were resourceful, creative, and _ self-reliant. Lesson 7. Dependability Objective: To understand more completely the great pioneer virtue ? dependability to show how the pioneers cherished honor in their dealings with their fellow men. Lesson 8. Thirst for Knowledge Objective: To inspire an appreciation in us of the pioneer thirst for knowledge, that urge to progress, that search for ultimate perfection. Lesson I Love of God For Tuesday, October 1, 1946 Objective: To show that the pioneers had a fundamental love of God, shown in their simple obedience to the principles of his truth. O the extent that man loves God, does he choose to keep the commandments of God. His love for his Maker is in a great measure proportionate to his desire and willingness to be obedient to divine laws and precepts, and to make personal sacrifices, when necessary, in order to conform to these laws and precepts. We read: If ye love me, keep my commandments. He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me.... If a man love me he will keep my words: and my Father will love him and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him (John 14:15, 21, 23). An outstanding example of a people united in their love of God, and in their faith in him is that of our pioneer forebears. For him and for the establishment of his kingdom, no sacrifice seemed too great. Like Job of old, they could say, "I know that my Redeemer liveth." They knew that he heard and answered prayers; that he came to earth and restored the gospel in these latter days; and that he commissioned the saints, through their Prophet, to help in the establishment of his Church and in spreading the glad tidings throughout the Church. 'To this cause they were committed. They loved the Lord and chose to be obedient to him in all things, even to leaving their dearly beloved city. Colonel Thomas L. Kane, the faithful and devoted friend of the saints, who called at Nauvoo in September 1846, reports the sad conditions he found after their departure. 482 I procured a skiff, and rowing across the river, landed at the chief wharf of the city. No one met me there. I looked and saw no one.... I walked through the solitary streets.... I went into empty workshops... No work people anywhere looked to know my errand... I could have supposed the people hidden in their houses, but the doors were unfastened; and when at last I timidly entered, I found dead ashes white upon the hearths,., Fields upon fields of heavy headed, yellow grain lay rotting ungathered upon the ground. No one was on hand to take in their rich harvest... And in and around the splendid temple which had been the chief object of my admiration, armed men were barracked, surrounded by their stacks of musketry and pieces of heavy ordnance. -. It was after nightfall when I was ready to cross the river on my return,... And I landed where a faint glimmering light invited me to steer. There among the dock and rushes, sheltered only by the darkness, with no roof between them and the sky, I came upon a crowd of several hundred human creatures... These were Mormons in Lee County, Iowa, in the 4th week of the month of September, in the year of our Lord 1846 (Whitney, Orson F., History of Utah, I, page 275). Love of God has been the activating principle in all the accomplishments of Latter-day Saints from the day of the organization of the Church to the present time. To the degree that Latter-day Saints love the Lord, as shown by their obedience to the counsel and admonitions of his leaders, will the Church go forward in this day and the Lord's work on earth be consummated. Meeting Sewing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting. See "Notes to the Field," page 450.) Work Meeting Committee, Velma N. Simonsen, Chairman Preview of Lessons for 1946-47 SEWING is quite properly spoken of as an art. It is an art in that it is a form of creative expression. The woman who sews finds relaxation in her work just as the painter does in his canvas or the writer does in his manuscript. Sewing is a practical art and should have a place in every woman's life. We have mothers in our own Society who are unable to lower the hems of their children's skirts, and who must hire a seamstress to do even the smallest of sewing tasks. This should not be so. Every girl should know the simple fundamentals of home sewing both as a convenience and also for economy's sake. When a person learns to sew she also discovers a new use for her hands and her leisure time, and the satisfaction she feels in the completed article is an experience she will want to repeat again and again. An assignment has been given to the Relief Society to stimulate, in the women of the Church, a keener interest and greater activity in some of the neglected arts of homemaking. Therefore, we are presenting a simple course in the fundamentals of home sewing. These lessons will LESSON DEPARTMENT be outlined in the Magazine for study in the months October through May. It is optional with each ward or branch whether or not it will adopt this course. (See "Notes to the Field," page 450.) While it is doubtful if, in any ward or branch, every member of the Relief Society would wish to participate in this dressmaking course, it is the hope that in every ward and branch there will be some who will desire to study it. 'Those not participating in the sewing course may go right on with the other activities of the work meeting. The day should be kept friendly and informal. Welfare sewing, of course, is the first responsibility for work meeting and this optional sewing course should in no way interfere with this assignment. These lessons, it is felt, can be used to advantage in raising the standard of the welfare sewing, as well as giving assistance to the inexperienced sewer in the making of her own and her children's clothing. They will give the experienced sewer an opportunity to render real service by assisting those less experienced and, at the same time, give some help, even to more experienced sewers, by offering simple, time-saving, professional methods of sewing. The teachers chosen for this course need not be experts or professional seamstresses. Any member of the Relief Society who is experienced in practical home sewing will be able to interpret the outlines and teach the fundamentals of this course. The sewing course is planned to be simple and applicable, covering 483 each step from the thimble to the finished article. Lessons in technique and practical application of principles will alternate. We hope, at the close of the season, a fashion show or an exhibit may be held, at which time the women may model and exhibit the clothes they have made during the Relief Society season. It is the hope that each ward and branch Relief Society will do everything possible to stimulate attendance at work meetings, and inspire an ambition in each member to make at least one article of clothing during the year, in addition to the service she will render the Society as such. The titles for the eight lessons follow: Lesson 1. Choosing Right Clothes Special attention will be given to colors, fabrics, basic styles, and lines. Lesson 2. Use of Tools and Treatment of Materials Lesson 3. Measuring Commercial patterns will be interpreted and adjusted to individual measurements and cutting. Lesson 4. Stitches Different kinds of bastings and uses and treatment of raw edges and seams will be demonstrated. Lesson 5. Pinning, Basting, Fitting, Pressing Lesson 6. Button Holes, Fastencrs Lesson Finishing, 'Trimming, Collars, Bands, Hems and Pockets Lesson 8. Exhibit or Fashion Show A display of articles made during Relief Society season will be shown. The textbook recommended for use is The Complete Book of Sewing.  Lesson I Choosing the Right Clothes For Tuesday, October 8, 1946 Women were made to give our eyes delight A female sloven is an odious sight. 'Tis woman's duty to be charmingly dressed. It is not a question of how much money she spends, but the intelligent manner in which she spends her money. If the fundamental principles of sewing and good grooming are adhered to, a woman can be as correctly dressed in cotton as in silk or velvet. Every girl should be taught how to sew correctly and effectively. It is an accomplishment that is not only an economy but a means of attaining individuality and smartness, and one that brings rich rewards in relaxation and satisfaction. A wardrobe made by an individual may be twice as extensive as one purchased ready made. The first step in dressmaking is to choose the proper styles, fabrics, -and colors suitable to you and your personality. Study yourself in the mirror. It is your truest critic. Become familiar with your weak points Edward Young (early 18th century) as well as your strong points. Study your posture, your walk, your facial expression, and your hair-do. Comb your hair in various ways and choose the most becoming style. Accent your attractive features. You can give the illusion of gaining inches in height and losing pounds in weight through the proper choice of styles. Don't be afraid of changing your styles. Colors that were not becoming to you at twenty may be best for you at forty, and visa versa. Learn to be individual; never copy another person. The clever clothes worn by someone else may appear dowdy and unattractive on you. Suggestions to Class Leaders: Bring materials of different colors, patterns, and textures. Drape them on women of different types for good or bad effects. Experiment with different necklines. Textbook References: The Complete Book of Sewing, Book Presentations, N. Y. 1943, I and II. Line  As Revealed in its Literature Elder Howard R. Driggs Preview of Lessons for 1946-47 HISTORY tells what man has done; literature reflects how he felt about it. Within the songs, stories, orations, drama, and other types of creative expression may be felt the heartthrobs of a people. If these creations are in consonance with fact; if they are true to life, and particularly if they are true to truth, they help make of history a living reality. Our central purpose in this series of studies is to discover and enjoy literature that "rings true" to the inner spirit of America. This means an alluring search for the gold nuggets that lie in the common sand and gravel. It means a careful testing LESSON DEPARTMENT of literary selections to separate the true from the false to find that which is soundly based on the fundamental principles of real Americanism.. These principles are rooted in true religion. Our nation, someone has said, was Bible-born. Certain it is that literature which truly reflects its inmost spirit is soundly democratic in the highest sense is in accord with the spirit of true Christianity. We shall do well to discover and foster such upbuilding literature. It is protective and patriotic to do so.. In carrying forward this important study, a series of lessons covering two years' work is planned. During the first year, the unfolding epic of America, viewed in the high lights of its literature, will be presented. For the second year, a more intensive study of chosen types of truly American literature will be made. From such lessons, rich in content and systematically followed, should come a clearer vision of America as our founding fathers began it, and as our pioneers carried it "from sea to shining sea." Here is a wealth of good reading and spiritual uplift. In offering it, there is clear realization of a vast, rich field. A temptation will be constant for teachers and students to stray away from the main road to alluring byways. This must be resisted if the goal a clearer understanding of America, and more devotion to this land of liberty is to be achieved. Let that beacon light be the guide, and rich rewards from the work will be won. Units of Study Lesson 1. Our American Indians in Literature 485 Inwoven with the epic of America's making in vital ways is the story of the red men. To get a more appreciative understanding of this colorful race the first Americans we know is the aim of this study. Better understanding of Indians, their nature, their admirable traits, their helpful contributions to our developing settlement and civilization, will come as worthy literature portraying Indian life and thought is studied. This may be found both in what expression we have from Indians themselves, and in that produced by authors who have caught something of their true nature and spirit. Latter-day Saints have a special interest and added knowledge and light for a deeper insight into this alluring theme. Lesson 2. Colonial Founders of America in Literature Columbus, led by inspiration, opened a new world. Following the great discoverer came folk of varied types seeking adventure, gold, and opportunity for greater freedom. So far as our own land is concerned, most of these liberty seekers wanted a place where they could worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience. This study will be centered mainly on these courageous, God-fearing souls who builded better than they knew. From them has come to us a heritage that grows richer with the passing years. Our part is to get closer to the Bible loving folk who dared the wide sea in their frail craft, and planted on the shores of our America their homes, their churches and schools. From some of these homes came many of the founders of our faith. Lesson 3. America's First War for Freedom in Literature Man's struggle for liberty a long, hard upclimb through the ages flames into brilliant reality during our Revolutionary War. Songs, stories, orations and essays truly expressive of this fighting epoch, will help bring its inner significance to us. This literature is vibrant with aspiration and courage of a people who visioned clearly their "inalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." To secure this right they went through the fires of testing conflict. It is a precious 486 heritage they have bequeathed to us one we should study with devotion. Lesson 4. Youthtime of a Nation Dedicated to Freedom Winning a war is one thing; winning a lasting peace is a sequence of as profound significance. In the story of the drafting and adopting of our Constitution, is drama of quiet intensity not often realized by those who live under its provisions and protection. The Lord has told us that this great charter of freedom is God-inspired. We shall do well to understand it better to get closer to the story of its making. Some of the literature to be studied in this unit will help achieve that result. Lesson 5. Westward March of America in Literature Widening of national horizons, adventures in charting new roads, carrying the 'White Man's Book of Heaven'' to the Indians, the important part of the Book of Mormon in shaping the destiny of the Farther West all will be given attention in this study. Following the war for freedom, which gave us a realm reaching from the Atlantic to the "Father of Waters," came the Louisiana Purchase, which extended our boundaries to the Rocky Mountains, and, after that, the frontier advancement to the shores of the Pacific. Our effort will be directed here to get closer to the spirit and meaning of this westward movement through such literature as portrays it truthfully. Lesson 6, Implanting American Civilization Across a Continent In the wake of the explorers and mountain men who charted our country, came the home builders. Settlers of the "blue grass' and Tennessee regions, of the "Land of the Lone Star," covered-wagon pioneers to Oregon and Utah are in this great drama. The California gold rush, the conquest of arid spaces, which added new stars to the flag, are among the stirring general scenes portrayed in the literature of the period. Choice stories, songs, and other types will be studied to help in the re-creating of this phase of the epic of America's making. Lesson 7. America through Testing Years This study, centering on the period of struggle to abolish slavery and the holding of the Union, offers opportunity to get closer to the hearts of the people of both sides of the conflict. A wealth of literature, portraying the varied phases of old plantation days, songs, stories, drama, is available. Orations also, dealing with the serious problems of the times, and revealing the inner spirit and meaning of America, as a freedom-loving nation, mark this period. There is also an abundance of literature expressive of the heroism on both sides of the testing conflict, and its aftermath of peace with the Union preserved. Lesson 8. America Land of All Nations Lured by the spirit of liberty and by expanded opportunity, people of every clime have come to make America their home. Under our protecting flag and Constitution, those of honest purpose are learning the American way of life, and becoming honest, useful, co-operative citizens. Latter-day Saints, having in large measure been gathered from all the world, and those who are "honest in heart" having learned how to work unitedly for the up-building of God's kingdom on earth, are in a position to give understanding help to those struggling to adapt themselves to the new life in this land of freedom to self-government. Literature, offered in this study, will help bring us closer to the problem will guide us in assisting others as well as ourselves to work concertedly in promoting civic righteousness, in making this a land of God-fearing folk, such as it must be to continue a land of liberty. General References: First, a good history of our country. Such a volume will doubtless be found in most home libraries. Certainly one may be rather readily obtained from the texts used in high schools, or in a public library. Second, a good collection of poems portraying our history. One of the best we have found is Poems of American History ? Revised Edition, Burton E. LESSON DEPARTMENT Stevenson. This in shorter form ? American History in Verse-?by the same editor, will serve helpfully. Third, specific references to poetry, 487 fiction, drama, oratory, and other literature are given with each study. Most of these may be found in home, school, and public libraries. Lesson I Our American Indians in Literature For Tuesday, October 15, 1946 Ye who love a nation's legends, Love the ballads of a people, That like voices from afar off Call to us to pause and listen, Speak in tones so plain and childlike, Scarcely can the ear distinguish Whether they are sung or spoken? Listen to this Indian legend, To this Song of Hiawatha! Ye whose hearts are fresh and simple, Who have faith in God and Nature, Who believe that in all ages Every human heart is human, That in even savage bosoms There are longings, yearnings, strivings For the good they comprehend not, That the feeble hands and helpless, Groping blindly in the darkness, Touch God's right hand in that darkness, And are lifted up and strengthened? Listen to this simple story, To this Song of Hiawatha! "THESE lines from the introduction to a great epic portraying the true heart and spirit of the red men, strike a clear keynote for this study. Not only has the poet Longfellow preserved in this epic many precious legends created by the Indians themselves, but he has revealed what too many folk overlook in these children of the open spaces? their truly religious nature. It was from a student of Indian life, Schoolcraft, that the poet Longfellow obtained first hand _ stories and other materials out of which much of the poem, Hiawatha, was created. How well the work was done is attested by the fact that the epic has won approval from those of high rank among the Indians themselves. "We look upon it as our poem," an educated Indian lady told the writer in Oklahoma a few years ago. "Hiawatha is our national hero." Any study of literature portraying the Indian may well begin with an appreciative study of the "Song of Hiawatha." Like other great epics, it is a hero tale made of many tales centered in a dominant character. Fact and fancy are inwoven to bring out the deeds and qualities of the hero. Naturally, one might expect in a tale of this kind depicting Indian life and ideals, a warlike leader. On the contrary, Hiawatha is a great peace-loving, constructive chieftain. The poem, according to Longfellow, "4s grounded on a tradition prevalent among the North American Indians of a personage of miraculous birth, who was sent among them to clear their rivers, forests, fishing grounds, and to teach them the arts of peace." All the admirable qualities of courage, kindliness, physical prowess turned to goodly deeds were in his nature. As portrayed by the poet, Hiawatha, son of the Westwind and the Prairie Lily, who dies deserted, is reared by his grandmother, Nokomis. We see him in a natural, Indian childhood, watch his developing 488 youth. Then, after a testing combat with his father, ending in the sire's acknowledgement of wrong and in reconciliation with his son, Hiawatha is given his commission of service for his people. Following this comes "Hiawatha's Fasting" a practice of purification for Indian youth. In this story ls the legend of the bringing of Indian come a precious gift of food from the Great Spirit. Through his faith and his fasting Hiawatha finally sees the youth, Mondamin: Dressed in garments green and yellow, Coming through the purple twilight, Through the splendor of the sunset; Plumes of green bent o'er his forehead, And his hair was soft and golden. And to Hiawatha faint from fasting this youth says: I, the friend of man, Mondamin, Come to warn you and instruct you, How by struggle and by labor You shall gain what you have prayed for... Rise, O youth, and wrestle with me. Added details of the interesting legend will be found in the poem. Suffice it to say here, that out of this testing struggle came at last the Indian corn: And before the summer ended Stood the maize in all its beauty, With its shining robes about it, And its long, soft, yellow tresses; And in rapture Hiawatha Cried aloud, "It is Mondamin! Yes, the friend of man, Mondamin!" Then he called to old Nokomis And Iagoo, the great boaster, Showed them where the maize was growing, Told them of his wondrous vision, Of his wrestling and his triumph, Of his new gift to the nations, Which should be their food forever. Added to this legend, others of significance are woven into the epic of Hiawatha. Within the lines of these stories is also something more ? interesting, descriptive touches portraying the life and customs of our Indians. We see, for example, how they built their graceful birchbark canoes, how they fished and hunted, how they were entertained round the fireside with stories by those, like old Iagoo, who knew how to tell them. Best remembered among the parts of the epic are those portraying the romance of the hero with the Arrow-maker's daughter, Minnehaha. In "Hiawatha's Wooing," the Indian courtship is pictured with artistry; in "Hiawatha's Wedding Feast," we are given a close view of the customs and joys of Indian life. A few lines will serve here as illustrative of the sweet wholesomeness with which the poet has told the story: As unto a bow the cord is, So unto the man is woman; Though she bends him, she obeys him, Though she draws him, yet she follows; Useless each without the other! Thus the youthful Hiawatha Said within himself and pondered,... Dreaming still of Minnehaha, Of the lovely Laughing Water, In the land of the Dacotahs. "Wed a maiden of your people," Warning, said the old Nokomis;... "Like a fire upon the hearthstone Is a neighbor's homely daughter, Like the starlight or the moonlight Is the handsomest of strangers!...' Then, with a grandmother's solicitude, she adds: "Bring not here a useless woman, Hands unskillful, feet unwilling; Bring a wife with nimble fingers, Heart and hand that move together, Feet that run on willing errands!" LESSON DEPARTMENT To which the smiling youth replies: "In the land of the Dacotahs Lives the Arrow-maker's daughter, Minnehaha, Laughing Water, Handsomest of all the women... She shall run upon your errands, Be your starlight, moonlight, firelight, Be the sunlight of my people!" Straightway, in his moccasins of magic, he goes to win this lovely girl. As he nears her home, he kills a red deer, flings it across his strong shoulders, and, reaching the tepee of the Arrow-maker, responds to the welcome that awaits him by laying the deer at the doorway. This is a symbol of not only his skill, but of his ability to provide for his household. Minnehaha, with the consent of her father, follows her lover back to his homeland. In "Hiawatha's Wedding Feast," we are given the welcome of the home folk. After feasting on typical Indian food, came typical entertainment. Characters who perform for the guests are Chibbabos, who sings "Onaway, Awake Beloved," a sweet Indian love song; Iagoo, who tells an Indian story; and Pau-Puk-Keewis, spirit of the stormwind, who dances the dizzying Beggars Dance. In all this we see and feel Indian spirit and life done by the creative touch of a great American poet. In "Blessing the Cornfields," we see the red men at peace, carrying forward their varied activities. A sacred ceremony in which Minnehaha plays the leading role is also portrayed. Another canto, "Picture Writing," shows something of their record keeping and symbolism, an art ascribed to their teacher, Hiawatha, who, legend has it: 489 In his wisdom taught the people All the mysteries of painting,... On the smooth bark of the birch-tree, On the white skin of the reindeer, On the grave-posts of the village. Days of difficulty and sorrow follow the times of peace. Friends of Hiawatha pass away. Troublemakers spread evil among his people. Finally comes hunger and disease with attendant tragedy. In "The Famine," we are given a most vivid portrayal of the sufferings visited upon the hero and his loved ones, and the passing of his heart's dearest Minnehaha. Poetic description of high artistry and deep feeling ? springing, it has been said, out of the loss of the author's own beloved wife is in this part of the epic. What follows is likewise of high quality, and of historical significance. In "The White Man's Foot," beginning with a sweet legend of the springtime, we are given also the story by Iagoo of the coming of the white men. The Indian folk all laugh derisively at the strange tale all but Hiawatha, who says: "True is all Iagoo tells us; I have seen it in a vision... Seen the people with white faces,.. From the regions of the morning,.. The Great Spirit, the Creator,. Sends them to us with his message." In the last of the cantos, "Hiawatha's Departure," the coming of the white man is portrayed. To the tribes of the northland, in which the poem has its main setting, it was the black-robe chief, the Jesuit missionary. Welcomed by the Indian leader, this stranger tells the assembled red men "the purport of his mission" and relates to them the 490 sacred story of the Savior, "how he fasted, prayed and labored" for the blessing and uplift of all. Hiawatha, commending the words to his people, takes the kindly stranger into his wigwam, gives him food and rest. Then, feeling that a new light has come for the red men, and that his work of uplift and blessing has been done, he quietly bids farewell to old Nokomis, and departs ?sailing westward in his magic canoe: To the regions of the home-wind,.. To the Islands of the Blessed, To the Kingdom of Ponemah, To the Land of the Hereafter! It is a parting similar in spirit to that of King Arthur and of other heroes round whom epics have been created. As with these other hero tales, more than just the story of a great character comes from reading the composite tale. In the epic is portrayed the life, the customs, the legends, the spiritual nature of the people. Another thing of import: To get the feel, the music, the pictures of Hiawatha and other hero tales, one must follow the advice of Longfellow: Lend to the rhyme of the poet The beauty of thy voice. In the simple repetitious lines of this Indian tale, is rhythm, cadence, charm. Words from the tongue of the red men lend themselves to expressive oral reading. Observe, for example, the musical beauty of lines such as these: In the vale of Tawasentha In the green and silent valley, Dwelt the singer Nawadaha. Round about the Indian village Spread the meadows and the cornfields, And beyond them stood the forest, Stood the groves of singing pine-trees. Every line of the poem, indeed, and each of the Indian words used to give it color and atmosphere, has a musical quality. 'To read the choice stories and lyrics in it aloud is to get recreation of sweet, wholesome type, is to get closer to the true heart of our American Indian. Moreover, an appreciative study of Hiawatha gives a basic knowledge of Indian life for the evaluation and enjoyment of other well - written, wholesome portrayals of the red men. What we have been given through the years, too frequently, is pictures of this people as savages. Doubtless they did exhibit savage qualities many times; perhaps we should nave done the same had we been forced to meet as they did the sawtooth edge of a rather cruel civilization. Despite the ruthlessness of uncivilized whites who fought and plundered, however, we do get some remarkable examples, at times, of nobility, kindliness, and good sense from the Indian men and women whom the varied groups of Americans met in the settlement of this vast country. With such names as Squanto, friend of the Pilgrims; Pocahontas, who he'ped save John Smith and the Virginia adventurers; Sacajawea, Bird Weman of the Lewis and Clark expedition; Washakie, friend of the Utah pioneers, ever come stories that lift our thoughts of the Indian to higher levels. Fortunately, some of our writers of earlier days and new, have portrayed for us the better side of the red men at the same time not forgetting the other side for LESSON DEPARTMENT "there ate Indians and Indians," just as there are white men and white men. James Fennimore Cooper is one of the authors who has given us a fair appraisal of Indian character. Both sides of the picture are portrayed in his classic Leatherstocking Tales, He was close enough to the Indian life in the region of the "Fingerlake country" of old New York to gather materials for his creative work. Most widely known of his novels is Last of the Mohicans ?frequently studied in high school. One admirable character in that intriguing story is Uncas, a young chieftain of high quality. Another author who has left us a classic Indian story is Helen Hunt Jackson. In her Ramona, a tale of old California, she gives us a picture of Indian life and characters during the closing days of the old missions. Impact with unscrupulous whites in the wake of the "gold rush" brings tragic consequences to the red men. It is a theme that stirred the righteous ire not only of this fine American writer, but of many others who felt the wrongs heaped on an inoffensive folk. Our Indians, it should be ever remembered, are human beings. Appreciating this truth, and it should be comparatively easy for those schooled in the gospel as taught by the Latter-day Saints to do so, we shall better understand the soul of the Indian. An experience of the writer, that of co-operating with "Uncle Nick" Wilson in creating The White Indian Boy, brought a nearer view of the real red folk in their home life, their struggles for food and clothing, their affection 491 for children, and their other human traits. 'To live through those days that this Mormon boy actually did for two years of tepee life as the adopted son of Chief Washakie's another, is to learn the true heart of the Indian. Another book of recent creation by Frank Linderman will bring something of the same knowledge _this from the Indian himself. In American, a firsthand life story of Chief Plenty Coos, of the Crow tribe, we live the life of an Indian boy. His training, his fasting, his fighting, his life contacts with not only Indians but whites, are simply, convincingly portrayed in the volume. In various dramas the red men have been portrayed, not, however, as major but rather as minor characters. One of our writers, who fora time lived in Utah, Edwin Milton Royle, created in his play The Squaw Man such a drama of popular appeal. Often in these days of photoplays, we have Indian characters, done less appreciatively, and generally with the red man depicted with too much savagery. Of Indian poetry and music much might be written, but only a few lines to stimulate further study can be offered here. To these red children, as to the Hawaiians and negroes, it seems just natural to sing. Thurlow Lieurance, creator of the popular song "By the Waters of Minnetonka," and an outstanding student of Indian music, says, "I am convinced that the Indian has a theme for every activity and characteristic of his life. His best songs are his spiritual songs." Some of these spontaneous songs 492 have been caught and recorded, it would seem, with fidelity to their spirit. Outstanding artist-students in this field are Natalie Curtis Burlin, who gave us a great contribution in The Indian's Book, and Mary Austin, author of The Path of the Rainbow and The American Rhythm. A few lines from poems found in these volumes will serve here to illustrate the delicate beauty and spirit of Indian lyrics at their best: These are from songs translated by Natalie Curtis Burlin: HOLY SONG All was revealed to me From the beginning Know I all, hear me! All was revealed to mel (Now saith the spirit, Tell of me; Dream thou!) SONG AFTER RAIN Now behold! Through bright clusters of flowers Yellow butterflies Are chasing at play, All through the blossoming beans Blue butterflies Are chasing at play. Ann Nolan Clark is another author who has given us some Indian lyrics of delicate quality (see History Sings by Hazel Gertrude Kinscella for the following and others): NIGHT Night is outside In his black blanket. I hear him Talking to the wind. I do not know him. He is outside. I am here In my mother's hogan, Warm in my sheepskin Close to my mother. The things I know are around me Like a blanket, Keeping me safe From these things Which are strange, Keeping me safe. All the trust of childhood, and the tenderness of mother love are in these lines. Natalie Curtis Burlin has suggested something of the difficulty and the conscientious work involved in delving into the "unexplored riches of the religious, poetic and musical thought of a stranger race" ?and setting before "the white race something of the art life (which is the soul life) of a simpler, yet more profound people." The Canadian Indian poet, Pauline Johnson, has written many excellent poems about her people. Some of the best known are published in the volume Flint and Feather. We all have much to learn from these first Americans. This study can only be an "Open Sesame" to the treasures in the theme. Latterday Saints, of all people, should be leaders in the search for these riches. Discussion and Activities 1. Hight lights from Hiawatha ? Be prepared to take part in reading aloud five to ten brief excerpts from this poem, assigned by the teacher, to give something of its spirit and its story. For example: "Wabun, the East Wind," Canto II. "Nokomis and Baby Hiawatha," Canto III. (Begin "At the door on summer evenings" to "Blossom in_ that _heaven above us.") Make other brief selections. Plan for ten to fifteen minutes presentation. 2. Indians in Fiction Be prepared to give an introduction of not more than two minutes to any one of the following characters: Uncas, Ramona, or another Indian character you feel is well portrayed in literature, fiction or drama. To make sure the introduction is held within two minutes, it will be well to write a paragraph or two on the character. 3.

Edgar Lyon Preview of Lessons for 1946-47
THIS course of lessons has been prepared for those Relief Societies in the stakes and missions that find the literature course unsuitable to their needs. Some Relief Societies are located in foreign-language missions, where the lessons dealing with American literature are not practicable. Many mission Relief Societies feel greater need for more gospel study, as the members are, for the most part, recent converts who desire doctrinal and religious instruction in preference to literary study. It is for situations of this type that these optional lessons have been prepared, and the choice of which course to study is left to the decision of the stake and mission Relief Society presidents.
The eight lessons in the course were planned as a survey of the gospel plan, emphasizing the place that our religious teachings should have in our daily lives. From the very inception of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, its leaders have attempted to lead the members to understand that the gospel is not a way of believing, or a mere mental assent to a group of doctrinal ideas. They have stressed the fact that true religion and life are inseparable. Even such an abstract doctrine as pre-existence has been interpreted in terms of its relationship to earth life, and the incentive it
might offer for the improvement of conduct during mortality.
During the year these lessons will trace the course of man's immortal life, beginning with his pre-earth existence and continuing on into the world in which we now live. A discussion of the first principles and ordinances of the gospel will be presented, not so much from the point of view of the scriptural proof for these practices, but rather from their meaning and significance in the lives of Church members today. Repentance is an eternal principle that must always find place in our lives. Baptism and the reception of the Holy Ghost, while usually experienced only once in a lifetime, become symbols of a new birth that should lead to a view of the newness of life that is ever changing and should be constantly improving. The interpretation of Church work as carried on by the members is interpreted as a means of seeking the abundant life Jesus pointed out as a goal.
The great amount of effort and means spent by the Church in the maintenance of its educational and recreational programs is discussed from the standpoint of their place in the philosophy of Mormonism, and in their application to our needs in the present social order. LESSON DEPARTMENT Lesson 1. Man's Earth Life Objective: To show that mankind passed through a pre-existent state, during which preparations were made for an earth life, in terms of a plan of salvation that might lead to exaltation. Lesson 2. The General Gospel Plan Objective: 'To inspire the members to realize the priceless value of their free agency as a necessary part of the gospel plan, and its part in eternal progression. Lesson 3. Faith Objective: 'To demonstrate that faith is a principle of action, giving power to the believer whereby great things may be achieved in life. Lesson 4. Repentance Objective: To illustrate the fact that repentance is a process through which we grow from wrong-doing to improved conduct, and draw closer to God. Lesson 5. Baptism Objective: To explain the symbolism and meaning of baptism in terms of its relationship to being "born again," into an improved way of living within the gospel fold. Lesson 6. Laying on of Hands for the Gift of the Holy Ghost Objective: To explain the nature of the Holy Ghost and its function in the lives of those who have had it bestowed upon them by proper authority. Lesson 7. The Abundant Life Objective: 'To show that service to one's fellow men and the observance of Church standards lead one to the enjoyment of abundant living here and hereafter. 495 Lesson 8. Education and Recreation Objective: To review the interest that the Church has always manifested in education and recreation, and to appreciate the part which these phases of Church endeavor now contribute to the lives of its members. References All the standard works of the Church have been used in the preparation of these lessons, and are referred to in the lessons themselves.
