DESERT BEAUTY Ethel VanHook Hopper Driving through a desert town Where growing things were scorched and brown, I saw beside a heaped-up load Of sagebrush on a dusty road, A woman in the heat and glare, With faded dress and wind-blown hair; She clutched white blossoms in her hand? Where had she found in this bare land Such beauty? Could the desert give These flowers that helped her soul to live I smiled she glanced with pleased surprise; What gratitude in those pale eyes! E} DEPARTMENT Suggestions and Instructions on the Educational Program?1946-47 COURSES for the coming educational year, 1946-47, October through May, are as follows: Theology ? "Church History" (Third and final year). Visiting Teachers' Messages  "Our Pioneer Heritage: Pioneer Virtues." Sewing A course in the fundamentals of sewing, optional for use by wards and branches. (See "Notes to the Field," page 450 of this issue of the Magazine for instructions to Relief Society officers. ) Literature America as Revealed in Its Literature." Optional Lessons in Lieu of Literature The Gospel as a Way of Life." (Instructions concerning the selection of one or the other of these two courses for the third Tuesday of each month may be found in "Notes to the Field," page 450 of this issue of the Magazine.) Social Science �The Family in the Gospel Plan." The aim of the courses to be given in Relief Society during the season 1946-47 is to make Relief Society members better Latter-day Saints, better mothers, and better citizens; and thus to strengthen the Latter-day Saint home. In order to accomplish these purposes, the General Board Page 472 presents lessons on Church doctrine; lessons in literature to interpret America as a land of freedom, calling attention to the need of upholding the Constitution of our land; lessons on fundamental concepts of Latter-day Saint family life; and simple lessons on sewing. The General Board feels that the diligent study of these various courses will give to Relief Society members a well-rounded development in matters essential to Latter-day Saint women in this day. Teaching in Relief Society Depending upon the skill of the teacher, many and varied methods of conducting a class period may be followed. All Relief Society teachers are not equally trained in teaching, and many fine teachers have not had professional training. The. Best teachers, however, are always eager to improve their methods and make more effective their teaching. It is of paramount importance, however highly skilled a teacher may be, that she teach in the spirit of the gospel and give prayerful and conscientious study to her lessons. In addition, however, to the preparation of the lesson by a teacher, she should present it in such a way as LESSON DEPARTMENT to awaken in the members of her class a wish to study and gain knowledge for themselves. This desired end may be obtained by a variety of methods by class participation either by an informal discussion, questions and answers, or by a more formal presentation such as a round table, panel discussion, etc., or by home study on the part of individual members. It is a great responsibility to undertake to teach a group of fellow Relief Society women. It is also a great privilege. From the hours of intensive study spent in preparation for each Relief Society lesson by a class leader, come intellectual growth and a greater understanding of the gospel. May each class leader in the coming season do her utmost to impart knowledge to her class members, and also awaken in them a desire to study and learn for themselves, so that the testimonies of all Relief Society members may be strengthened, and their lives be lived more in conformity with the principles of the gospel. Lesson titles and lesson aims for the entire year's courses of study are given in the previews, but these may be subject to change. Correspondence on Lessons Ward class leaders who desire help on any matter pertaining to a lesson should consult their stake leaders. Stake leaders desiring information may address such correspondence to General Board of Relief Society, 28 Bishop's Building, Salt Lake City 1, Utah. It is not desirable to address communications either to the authors of the lessons or to any other Church office. 473 Textbooks and Special References Textbooks should be supplied for the use of the respective class leaders from the funds of the Society. On the completion of the courses in May 1947, it is suggested that the counselor in charge of education see that all books bought during the year by Relief Society funds are collected and placed in the Relief Society library for future use. Many books which have been used in Relief Society in past years (such as The American Citizen's Handbook, in use by Relief Societies for the social science lessons in 1942-43, which will supply supplementary material for the literature course "America as Revealed in Its Literature" for 1946- 47) will be found of great worth in preparing the current year's lessons. It is important that books bought by Relief Society through the years be carefully preserved for future reference. Textbooks for courses for the year 1946-47 are as follows: Theology: Doctrine and Covenants, $1.00; Smith, Joseph Fielding: Essentials in Church History, $2.00. Sewing (Optional course for work meeting): The Complete Book of Sewing, Book Presentations, New York, 1943, $2.95.: These textbooks may be obtained from the Deseret Book Company, 44 East South Temple, Salt Lake City 10, Utah. A list of books to which references are made in the current year's lessons, and which will prove of lasting worth in a Relief Society library, follows: Standard Works of the Church Bible Book of Mormon Doctrine and Covenants Pearl of Great Price 474 Books by Latter-day Saint writers on Church subjects, referred to in Relief Society lessons for 1946-47: A Story to Tell, published by Sunday School and Primary (includes pioneer stories) Bowen, Albert E.: Constancy Amid Change Discourses of Brigham Young.

Wayne Driggs Preview of Lessons for 1946-47 A PREVIEW of the third and final year's course of study entitled "Church History" introduces the lessons for 1946-47. 'Titles for the last eight lessons and their objectives follow below. It will be remembered that the central theme for the course is to be found in the Savior's words, "By their fruits ye shall know them." Again we shall look at the fruits of Mormonism and find them good. By way of review we may summarize the three parts of the course once more. Part I for 1944-45 was devoted to the opening dispensation of the fulness of times and had as its objective the mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the coming of the "church out of the wilderness"'; Part II for 1945-46 outlines the story of the saints in their movement to "the place which God prepared" in the tops of the everlasting mountains; Part III for 1946-47 pertains to the coming-of-age period of the Church with its broadened activities meeting the swift sweep of our modern times. The main objective of the course is to narrate the more important events of Church history and to consider the revelations in their relation to the historical episodes. We revere the revelations contained in the book of the Doctrine and Covenant as the revealed word of God for our day. The titles of the eight lessons for this year's course follow: LESSON DEPARTMENT Lesson 17.
