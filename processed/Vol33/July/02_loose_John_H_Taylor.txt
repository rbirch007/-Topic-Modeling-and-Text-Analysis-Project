Pioneer Stories and Incidents Indians on the Plains President Amy Brown Lyman This is the first in a series of true pioneer incidents to be published by Thein honor of the 1947 Utah Centennial celebration AMONG the many problems confronting the Mormon pioneers, both on the plains and afterward in "the Valley," were those connected with the Indians. Notwithstanding the precautions taken by the pioneers, and their desire to deal fairly with the Indians, many trying situations presented themselves. On their part, the Indians naturally resented the white people and, to add to the difficulties, there was enmity among the various Indian tribes. While the Indians on the plains, mostly Pawnees and Sioux, were apparently friendly to the pioneers, they were mercenary, and the temptation for them to steal horses and cattle was often too great for them to resist. Their method was to follow the pioneer tram quietly and stealthily, and, in the darkness of night, to creep in among the animals, cut their ropes, and foment a stampede. In most cases the animals would scatter in all directions, and the Indians usually succeeded in making off with some of them. In the Journal or the pioneer John Brown, we read: Next day we... Reached Ash Hollow near the Platte. We camped near the brush in the hollow after dark... I came on the second watch that night. The first guard told us to keep a sharp lookout. The mules were very uneasy. One man discovered something near where a Page 440 mule was staked, and threw a bone at it, supposing it to be a dog, but it ran off like a man half bent. About this time I discovered a horse going loose across the corral. I went and examined the rope which was about six feet long. I felt the end of it and pronounced it cut and immediately alarmed the camp and turned out all hands. We found several horses cut loose and one mare and two colts missing. We kept everything close till morning when a search was made and a trail up the hollow in the sand showed where the three animals had been driven off, and nine pairs of moccasin tracks in the trail were found.... Six men followed the trail that day but could find nothing (Autobiography of John Brown, page 8). On the return trip of the pioneers across the plains (September 20, 1847) at LaBorte in the Black Hills, pioneer Brown wrote: About an hour by sun we went to drive in our animals to start our journey. Brother G. A. Smith and myself had got about halfway to the horses when the guard gave the alarm that the Indians had charged upon the herd and we could hear them yelling and firing their guns. We, not having our arms with us, ran back to get them. I got my rifle and started back to the herd but had not gone more than 100 yards when I met the Indians, who were coming on both sides of the river and over the hills some two or three hundred in number. We were soon mixed up and the greatest confusion prevailed for a few minutes. Our animals were all secured but eleven head which the Indians succeeded in running off at the beginning. No one was hurt during the whole struggle. They took all my (Continued on page 463) The Settlement of Sanpete Valley Leda Thompson Jensen Former Member, Relief Society General Board PART II THE early communities that dotted Sanpete Valley from north to south were settled by groups of converts to the Church selected by Brigham Young. He used great judgment and wisdom in the selection of these groups of people to settle different localities, considering carefully their backgrounds, aptitudes, and previous training in connection with the possibilities of the region they were to settle. Most of the fifty families sent to Manti in 1849 were from the northeastern part of the United States or from England. In 1850, however, apostle Erastus Poe SS MS ERS. PSS Photograph by Grace O. Tuttle Snow was sent to Europe to open missions in the Scandinavian countries, and many converts from the "Northland" soon immigrated to the "Valleys of the Mountains." The altitude of Sanpete Valley is much higher than Salt Lake Valley, and hence, colder. Sanpete was, and always has been, essentially an agricultural section. When, in 1853, the first immigrants from Denmark arrived in Salt Lake City, they were sent on to Sanpete. These people, coming from countries where farming and cattle raising were the principal industries, understood how to meet the conditions in Sanpete MOUNT BALDY, NEAR THE HEAD OF TWELVE MILE CANYON This lofty summit, one of the most beautiful in Sanpete Valley, overlooks a wide area of scenic interest and rises above the plateau grazing lands, east of Gunnison, Utah. Page 441 442 ley; and it was not long before they built comfortable homes for themselves and roomy barns for their cattle. These Scandinavian converts, many of whom had traveled across the plains in the handcart companies, were now in the majority in Sanpete Valley, particularly in Ephraim, and several of the towns were affectionately called "Little Denmark." These hardy saints brought with them a knowledge of economy, conservation, and husbandry, a valuable contribution to the Valley commonwealth. At first, the Danish pioneers were somewhat misunderstood by the earlier settlers, but the young people soon became interested in one another and began to intermarry. The barriers of nationality were forgotten by the people of the second generation; and all worked together side by side, excellent citizens, loyal to their country and to the Church which had brought them together in a new land. No matter from what countries the Utah pioneers came, no matter what traditions of the old countries they brought with them, no matter what customs they had known before, they were all interested in working for the same objectives. Their first concern was to till the soil that life might be sustained, and to build homes that their families might be comfortably sheltered. The philosophy of community life held by the Church, and the natural conditions of the soil, the water supply, and the common enemy, the Indians all these forces, working together, produced a united front, strong and courageous. By 1860, the larger settlements? Manti, Spring City, Ephraim, CUTTING THE STONE FOR THE MANTI TEMPLE Out of an unbroken terrain was hewn the oolite stone to build the edifice and the protecting wall, BUILDING THE FOUNDA Mount Pleasant, Moroni, Gunnison, Fairview, and Fountain had all been located quarried Mountains, Mount Pleasant, Moroni, Gunnison, Fairview, and Fountain Green had all been located and were growing communities. Later, enterprising men from these towns branched out to nearby sites and founded the smaller villages � Indianola, Milburn, Chester, Sterling, Fayette, Mayfield, Centerfield, and Axtell. These communities were soon eager for more than a mere living. They looked forward to the acquisition of knowledge, to their cultural improvement, and to their spiritual betterment. The first public buildings erected were designed for Church gatherings and for schools. Often the same building was used for both purposes until time and means would permit the erection of another building. The materials close at hand were used to build the early meeting houses which were called tabernacles rather than ward chapels, as they are designated today. In the Wasatch Mountains bordering the Sanpete Valley to the east, were found ledges of oolite, a very beautiful white limestone. This was quarried out of the mountains, shaped and cut by expert stonecutters, and used for the building of the first meeting houses. The walls were thick and the structures so well built that nearly all of these first churches are still in use, although they have been remodeled to accommodate the growing and changing needs of the Church. Sanpete Stake was organized July 4, 1877, with Canute Peterson as president and Henry Beal and John B. Maiben as counselors. Thus, all the smaller ward units in the Valley were united with the larger settlements under one head, and unitedly they began the tremendous task of building a temple to the Most High. ON an August day in 1850, President Brigham Young, then on his first visit to the settlements in Sanpete Valley, had pointed to  THE MANTI TABERNACLE (1890) The women, dressed in Danish costumes, are assembled to take part in the celebration welcoming the railroad. Note the replica of a railroad engine near the top of the building. The evergreen decorations on each side were designed and contributed by the various Sanpete Valley towns. Manti Hill and prophesied that a temple should one day stand thereon. Heber C. Kimball, one of President Young's companions on the trip, further testified that this temple should be built of stone quarried from the very heart of the hill. More than twenty years later, April 25, 1877, President Young dedicated this temple site. With his cane, he indicated the spot on which the southwest corner of the building should stand. Faith and perseverance characterized the people in this great undertaking. The saints donated liberally of their scanty funds and work on the temple was donated freely, following the advice of Brigham Young when he said to the bishops: "Now bishops, if any person should inquire what wages are to be paid for work done on this temple, let the answer be 'Not one cent.''"" From the unbroken terrain was hewn the oolite to build the edifice and the protecting wall. The best the people had to give in skill and industry was put into this great temple, and in eleven years it was completed. On the spring morning of May 20, 1888, the dedicatory services began. 'These services were repeated on the three following days in order to accommodate the many saints who desired to attend the sacred dedication. Although schools were established as soon as possible after the settlements were founded, and, during the winter months, men and women gifted in the art of teaching were called, or, by choice, acted as teachers, the early days in Sanpete Valley did not provide many educational opportunities. President Canute Peterson and other community leaders felt that there was a great need among the people for a school which would provide training beyond the grammar grades. The pioneers believed that their children should have educational advantages near their homes so that they might become leaders in their own communities. In 1888, the Sanpete Stake Academy was established at Ephraim, and, although it was, in the beginning, a school comparable to our modem high schools, it served as an institution of higher learning. Not only did its students come from all over Sanpete County, but from other counties as well. The beginnings of this Academy were humble, but through faith and persistence the school prospered and grew, and THE SETTLEMENT OF SANPETE VALLEY 445 Presidents of the Manti Temple: Daniel H.

This college, originally a Latter-day Saint institution, is now a State-supported junior college, and stands as a monument to the vision and the determination oft hose early pioneers. Construction of a courthouse was begun in 1864. The original building consisted of one room, built of adobe, and plastered on the outside. In 1873, an additional room, built of stone, was added, and a porch built on the west side. Additional improvements were made later and the building was in constant use until 1937, when a new building was erected and the old one torn down. The first means of communication with the outside world, aside from trips made on horseback or by horse or oxen-drawn conveyances, came in December 1866, when the Deseret Telegraph Line was completed to Manti. This placed Sanpete in direct  communication with the capital city, and gave the farmers and stockmen valuable information on the prices of grain and cattle, thus advising them when to start by team or horseback to market their products. In the early 79�s, the Valley was connected with the outside (Continued on page 464)
