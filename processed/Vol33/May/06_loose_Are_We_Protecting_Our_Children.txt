Are We Protecting Our Children? Leone O. Jacobs Member of the Relief Society General Board N a recent article by Angelo Patri, he says, "The latest report on the death of young children is something to make us all quiver. The health of our babies is wonderful and we have a fine crop of them. But the record of fatal accidents to young children is shocking. Why do we allow these needless fatalities to the little ones? The accidents happen at home for the greater part. Imagine that!" It takes a lot of doing on the part of adults, and especially on the part of mothers, to safeguard children against hazards in the home. I am sure none of us realized just how many little things there were to watch and guard against until we had the responsibility of homes of our own. The difference between knowledge and wisdom is an important point in relation to safety. We know that knowledge denotes acquaintance with facts, but wisdom "consists not in knowing many things, nor even in knowing them thoroughly, but in following what contributes most to our lasting happiness." And so we may know what the dangers in the home are, but unless we use wisdom in applying the knowledge we have, unless we do something about those dangers, our knowledge is of no avail. We must be constantly on the alert to: Page 302 Keep stairways clear. 2 Avoid carrying hot liquids. Never leave a pan of hot water on the floor. Keep water in automatic water heaters below scalding temperature. 4 Tack stair carpets securely. 5 Secure small rugs at corners. 6 Keep medicines locked up. Medicines should be clearly labeled and never taken in the dark. 7 Turn handles of pots, heating on the stove, away from the reach of children. When taking off lids, raise them in toward the stove instead of out, so the hot steam will not burn anyone. 8 Teach children never to tum switches on the gas stove. If gas has escaped, air the room thoroughly before relighting the burners. Disconnect all electrical equipment and cords immediately after using. Small children may be instantly killed or severely shocked by putting an attached cord into their mouths. 10 Cupboards should not be so high that climbing is necessary, nor so full that bottles or cans may fall out and break, or hit someone. 11 Toys should not be left lying on the floor even such small items as marbles on the floor can cause serious falls. These are some of the hazards to guard against, ARE WE PROTECTING OUR CHILDREN? AR too many fatalities among children are the result of their being left alone or in the care of an immature person. Children are at the mercy of those who care for them. It is criminal to leave them when they cannot take care of themselves in an emergency. Some parents put the children to bed and go out for the evening. "Oh," they say, "nothing will happen. We've done it many, many times and the house hasn't bumed down, no one has turned on the gas or swallowed a pin." Yes, but it does happen to some children not yours, of course! It may never happen to your children, 303 but just the same, it might! It takes only one fire or one pin to cause disaster. A mother may be bathing her ten-months-old baby when the telephone rings. She thinks, Oh, I'll just be a minute. She'll be all right. She loves to play in the water. It is a friend on the phone who is planning a party and wishes suggestions for refreshments. The talk goes on and on. Who knows what baby is doing in the meantime? Children, and even small babies, are locked in the car while mother goes shopping. Can anyone be sure of the consequences? A 'mother cannot afford to take 304 her responsibility to her children lightly. The time she gives to the well-being of her children is the finest contribution she can make to humanity. A small boy runs into the street after his ball, directly in the path of an approaching car. A little girl is playing quietly in the driveway and suddenly a truck backs out and crushes her tiny body. Who is to blame? Much can be accomplished by training children at home. "But," you say, "when a child's ball rolls out into the street, or when he is being chased by a playmate, he never thinks to look, no matter how much he has been taught!" Children differ in this respect, of course, but I have seen children who do stop and look before dashing into the street, even while at play. Then there are those who are careless, and tell only on good fortune to save them. The difference lies mainly in the training of the individual child and the example set by his elders. Very few children receive enough education in safety at home. Yes, they have been warned and threatened, but the training and super vision must be consistent over a long period of time to be effective. Example is an important part of teaching. What adults do, children imitate. Any adult who disregards a safety rule, may be contributing to the peril of some child. The schools have done a splendid job of training our children to observe traffic rules, and our observations prove that the children obey traffic regulations far better than adults. Very seldom do we see a child cross on a stop light or jaywalk. There are numerous perils in the life of a child, diseases such as poliomyelitis, rheumatic fever, etc., that, as yet, we are unable to prevent, but surely we should eliminate the perils which come through careless neglect. Motherhood is the most important responsibility in all the world and yields the greatest dividends. Our children are the hope of our nation. They are the promise of tomorrow. Give them the chance they deserve! Let our watchword be: "Eternal vigilance is the price of safety."
