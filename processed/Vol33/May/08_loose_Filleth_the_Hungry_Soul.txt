Filleth the Hungry Soul" Frances C. Yost OUNG Jonathan Wood finished the last of the sego roots his morning meal, as his wife, Abigail, looked on. Poor Jonathan, she thought, his cheek bones poke out more every day. He actually looks half-starved. I don't see how he keeps going, just eating sego roots. He works so hard. Is it possible he is beginning to really like them? He certainly cleaned up the dish with relish. Abigail refrained from stating aloud the high contempt in which she held the sego root, practically their only source of food until the garden would come on and the grain be harvested. She was absorbed with her thoughts until Jonathan picked up the straw hat she had woven for him and opened the door. "Jonathan, haven't you forgotten something?" "Oh, yes, our 'goodbye - for-a while' kiss." Abigail hurried to the door with him. "I can see you are worried," she said, as she looked questioningly into his sun-tanned face. "Are the crops a complete failure, and are you trying to keep it from me?" "No, Abbie, I'm not keeping any bad news from you. I guess I was just in a hurry. I'm going to water the grain. It's looked pretty sick the last few days. Brother Brigham said he would come first thing this morning and help me with some ditches." "President Brigham Young helping you irrigate!" exclaimed Abigail in bewilderment. "Then the crops are in great danger! Oh, can irrigation possibly save the grain?" "Bless your heart, Abigail, don't ? worry. Here's another kiss for good measure." With these words, Jonathan took leave of his young wife and went to work in the fields. With a sigh, Abigail surveyed the one room of her pioneer home. Jonathan had built it. Her eyes tested on the fireplace. She never grew tired of looking at it. It was most decorative, even in hot weather when it was not in use much. They had built the fireplace of red and white granite. The hewn rocks had been placed together in a checkerboard arrangement, and Abigail's fireplace had soon become the envy of every other pioneer homemaker. The shining pots hung in their places. On one side were the table and chairs, in the opposite corner was a cupboard of split pine. How empty it looked! Were it not for the blue willow dishes her grandmother had given them as a wedding present, it would be quite bare. The set was one of the three things Jonathan had consented to bring with them on the long, hard journey, "Because," as she had told Jonathan at the time, "I just can't go without them." The other half of the room was used as the bedroom. There was a big double bed. It boasted polished legs and a beautiful headrest of striped pine and was covered with a log cabin patchwork quilt which hung to the floor. Cuddled close to Page 305 306 the bed was a cradle made of quaking aspen, wherin Baby Annie was sitting, fascinated by her pink toes. In the other corner was the little green metal trunk, another reminder of the home in Connecticut they had left. Above the trunk hung a mirror, the third article from her dear old home. The well-packed dirt floor boasted two nice rag rugs. Both were Abigail's contribution to their new home. One was by the door, and the other was placed in front of the bed, where they knelt together fer morning and evening prayers. Our own home and how I love it, but I'd trade it all for a real good meal for us all, Abigail decided solemnly. She was brought from her wishful dreaming by the sound of a kettle of water boiling merrily. The kettle hung on a rod over a campfire just outside the door. She took the kettle from its hook with a pair of long tongs and carried it into the house for baby Annie's bath. She poured the hot water into a quaint bathtub, which was another piece of Jonathan's woodcraft. He had hollowed out a log and smoothed and polished it for a bathtub for the baby. Abigail enjoyed the tub so much because she never had to worry about its tipping over, nor of baby Annie slipping in it. She cooled the water until it tested just right on her elbow. "Baff," cooed Annie. "Yes, dear, you can have a nice long bath while Mother tidies up the house." The baby played to her heart's content. Thank goodness, Abigail thought, there is plenty of water, if one doesn't mind carrying it. Taking the baby from the tub, she put clean clothes on her and, while the water was still warm, Abigail washed out the clothes Annie had been wearing. It doesn't pay to let things get too soiled, she thought. Oh, fora bar of fresh-smelling soap. But I'd really rather have a loaf of fresh-smelling bread at that. HEN, going to the cupboard for a cup of milk, she looked at the contents longingly but did not take so much as a sip. Baby Annie needed every drop. If the vegetables would only come on, she thought, Annie needs some fresh vegetables as well as milk. Back home we would have all kinds of vegetables by this time of year! Then, aloud, she exclaimed: "Why, its my birthday, today! Jonathan has forgotten, too, but I shan't mention it for he'll feel badly that he hasn't a present for me." Thoughts of her past birthdays and the very special dinners each had brought made her wonder just what she could fix for this one. "T know, we'll celebrate my birthday by not having sego roots for one meal," she announced to the baby as she looked through her scanty supplies. "Let's see, there's vinegar and enough staples for a small mixing. I could make some meal cakes. Perhaps I shouldn't use the very last meal we have, but after all, it is my birthday, and they'll taste so good after what we've had!" With happy thoughts of a change of diet, though meager, Abigail hummed a part of a song she loved: "Why should we mourn, or think our lot is hard, 'tis not so, all is well." Mixing the dough, she divided it" into three small cakes, as baby Annie sat on the big bed playing pattycake. "FILLETH THE HUNGRY SOUL" watched the making progressed. At last, it was finished. With the use of the tongs, she carried the Dutch oven into the keys were set to "Um-mmm, I could eat them all] Myself right now," sniffed Abigail, as she looked at the steaming cakes, Just then a gentle tap was heard on her door. She quickly covered the meal cakes with 4 clean cloth and hurried to see who her visitor might be. It was Lucy Hanson, her nearest neighbor, "Hello, Lucy come in?" "Just for a few minutes, Abbie, I now you're busy and I don't want to detain you," 'You look bred, Lucy. I hope you're not feeling il]," dear, won't you Lucy sat on the offered chair, her bony form revealing its heavy burden. "Tm not ill, Abigail, not really. Just a little tired, I... I just don't seem to have any strength!" Lucy made an attempt at a laugh. "I just came from the garden, Oh, Abbie, had so hoped there would be some enough to thin out. But they're hardly more 307 than through the ground! There wasn't even enough for a tiny flat. Abigail, not to be outdone, replied optimistically, "Lucy, it won't this morning that Brother Brigham Amos with his irrigating. So now you see, your grain Will surely make!" "Abigail, the harvest may as well "Always before my the loaves and Placing them in the Oven. Sometimes I can almost smell a delicious oven fragrance, and I just want to shut my eyes and stop fighting..." Lucy need not know I have the cakes, thought Abigail. Lucy and Amos Hanson Were given as much meal allotment as we. If I have been more frugal, well, that's just Lucy Hanson's hard luck! When Abigail looked again at Lucy, she was drying a tear with er apron. Stealing a have given away every dish of my blue willow set for 4 crust of bread before Annie was born. | could.... 308 I could give her my cake. She needs it more than I. I will give her my own meal cake! WALKING over to the split-pine cupboard, she took from the top shelf a plate which belonged to the blue willow set. Placing a doily lovingly on the plate, she went quickly, lest she change her mind, to the table where the three precious meal cakes were covered. Choosing the nicest looking one, she went back to the chair where Lucy sat still dabbing her eyes in an effort to hide her tears. "Here, Lucy, eat this. It isn't much, but you'll feel better, I'm sure.' Lucy looked up and her hand automatically reached for the food. Then, with restraint, she drew her hand back. "Abigail, darling, you're so thoughtful and generous, but I couldn't take it, really. I wasn't begging. I came for sympathy only. I'll just have a drink. I wouldn't think of robbing you, and begin" "Lucy, I want you to have it. I have mote.' "Ate you sure you're not giving me your last morsel of food?" "Quite sure, Lucy dear, and you'll welcome to it even if it were.' "Well, if you're sure you want me to have it.... It looks so very tempting." Lucy took the plate offered her and ate slowly, enjoying every morsel to the fullest. Abigail watched her hands as they went from plate to mouth. The very food she had planned for her own birthday dinner! Dinner, there was that word again. Jonathan would be coming in soon and a good wife couldn't set a hungry husband down to a table with one meal cake. "Lucy, I haven't prepared Jonathan's dinner. I must gather my roots. I think I'll try cooking them and serving them with a little vinegar, just for a change." "Oh, Abigail, you're so clever, you make them sound almost good! I won't keep you. I should go myself. I can't tell you what this food means to me. You have saved my life, as well as my baby's. Now I know I shall be able to carry on. God bless you, Abigail!" "Come over again, Lucy." Lucy was gone. Turning slowly, Abigail went back into her house. She glanced at baby Annie in the cradle. She would sleep for a while yet, and it wasn't far to a large patch of sego lilies. If she hurried she could make it! Snatching her sunbonnet, she slipped quietly out, and ran to the open prairie. The tears, so long held back, burst forth. Alone, she did not have to put on a brave front. On she ran, letting the tears come. Blindly she came upon the sego lily patch, and fell to the ground and wept as if her heart would break. There she lay until her well of 'tears was completely dry. I'm not the only person in the world who has divided food with a friend or neighbor, she thought reprehensively. Then, raising herself to her knees, and bowing her head, she prayed, "Dear God, in heaven above, I promise thee, this day, that as long as I live I will not complain nor apologize to others for the little food we have in our home, if thou wilt "FILLETH THE HUNGRY SOUL" 309 only provide us with bread. Just bread! Dear God. Amen."
Just then Abigail felt strong familiar arms about her waist, helping her to her feet.
"Abbie, darling, the wheat fields are nodding as if the very hand of God were pushing them! You should have been with me when I irrigated. Why, the water really laughed as it rippled through the grain. And every spear of wheat nodded its thanks. Look at it now, Abbie. You can almost see it growing before your very eyes! There is the answer
to your prayer. Abbie, something tells me your hungry days are almost over."
Abigail wiped the tears from her face with her apron.
"I say, Abbie, why don't we try vinegar on the sego roots for your birthday dinner?" Jonathan asked as if he had discovered the solution to all worldly problems.
Suddenly, they were laughing as they clung to each other�good, deep laughter that rewarded the heart, and together they dug roots enough to sustain them.

Delsa Davis McBride
I met a poet once, and read a poem He wrote about common things and home; I, too, will write, I thought, I'll write of love And a rhyme about the stars above, About the folks who like to roam� I'll write a lovely poem! Then a singer came along, Singing a happy hunting song. "It is better far," said I, "to sing� Look what happiness a song can bring!" That was before the girl from France Came to town and I saw her dance. Now, thought I, I will dance awhile Before an audience and watch them smile; I'll dance as fairies dance at night, Surely this time I must be right! But that was before I met you Or ever heard a baby coo. Now I am mistress of a home, But I never have time to write a poem. The singer can sing his song, not I, I only have time for a lullaby. I never, never have a chance To dance awhile as fairies dance. But I wouldn't trade with the singer lad (My baby girl can say dad dad!), I wouldn't trade with the girl from France (My baby is sweeter than any dance!), I wouldn't trade with the poet of our (My baby has golden curls, like you!).
