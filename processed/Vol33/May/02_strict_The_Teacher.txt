THE TEACHER
Mary E. Abel
What mission could be greater Than to comfort, cheer, and bless, And bring our Father's children here Real joy and happiness?
Each little act of service given, Each word in kindness spoken, Will bring the giver near to Heaven And heal the heart that's broken. Faith Is a Heritage Christie Lund Coles CHAPTER 2 SYNOPSIS Enid Drage, mother of a small girl, is very happy in her household tasks and in the love of her husband, Tom, who has been promised the position of foreman at the factory where he works. Enid believes that the future holds great treasures for her and her family, but suddenly her world is darkened by the news that Tom has suffered a fatal accident. THE funeral was something Enid was to remember as one remembers a dream, hazy and unreal, yet paralyzing in its impact. And borne, somehow, though one knows not how. A strength beyond physical strength, a peace beyond any peace she had ever known had sustained her through the songs, through the kind, hopeful words of those who spoke, even through that last, horrible moment when she saw him for the last time. Then she wanted to cry out, to seize him bodily in her slim, young arms, to run with him so that no one might ever take him from her again. But the power that had seen her through the rest held her through this. The agonizing moment passed and she moved like one anesthetized. She found herself, together with the few relatives of Tom's who had come from out of town, back at the house. The neighbors had cleaned it, put flowers about, and prepared an appetizing meal. Enid shuddered as she looked at the steaming food." She could not possibly have eaten Page 318 though the others did, assuring her she needed strength. And when they had finished, they left, beseeching her to let them know if she needed help of any kind. The door closed on the last of them and she stood, her back against it, staring at the two-room flat. It looked shabby and poor now.... As it really was. The magic that had made it bright and beautiful was gone. Sharon was with one of the neighbors who had offered to keep her that day. For the first time, she was alone with her grief. And for the first time, looking at the small crib, the dresser where Tom's ties hung in one corer, seeing his shoes in the closet, she threw herself across the bed, buried her face in her hands and wept.... Copious, shaking tears that seemed to come from the very roots of her being. After a long time she ceased her weeping. She lay still, staring into space. The twilight shadows were growing long in the room. She knew she should go and get the child, but she couldn't bring herself to do it. Somehow, she dreaded seeing that face which was so much like another face. She resented it a little, too, found it almost unbearable that his looks, his eyes, the very cowlick in the child's hair, which was like his, would go on while he would not be here. FAITH IS A HERITAGE She closed her eyes wearily while her thoughts, unbidden, turned back over the past years. She had been nineteen when she met Tom. Both of them had been at the university. One day in English Two she really noticed him for the first time, noticed his wide shoulders and his dark, slightly curly hair. As she was looking at him, he turned and their eyes had met. She liked the rather shy, quizzical way he smiled at her, and, flushing a little, she returned the smile. Somehow, it didn't seem strange for him to be waiting for her at the door as she came out of class. "You're Enid Burton, aren't you?" he asked with friendliness. "Yes," she admitted, "and you?" "I'm Tom Drage. Mind if I walk down with you?" She said, "No. I suppose not," and they found themselves going down the corridor together. As it happened, neither of them had a class the next period so they walked out on the campus and sat under the beginning-to-be-green trees. It was spring then, too. Later than now and warmer, but there was the same scent of newness, of growth, in the air. She could almost repeat every word they said, could hear him now saying the words. What a strange thing, memory! Like a moving picture of someone who has gone. She had known in a peculiar instinctive way that someday she would marry him, that if he asked she would go to the ends of the earth to be near him. She had told him she was going to teach and he had grinned, murmuring, "Not you. You're too pretty to be a school teacher. You'll get married to some 319 lucky fellow. It might even be me you'll marry." They laughed as if it were a good joke. Yet, it was only a week or so later that he said, as they sat in practically the same place, "School will be over soon. I don't believe I'll come back next year...." She looked at him in shocked surprise, her heart sinking. She asked, "Why not?" He bit on a blade of grass before he told her, "Well, there's something mighty wrong with me. I can't eat. I talk in my sleep. I can't seem to concentrate.... Except on one thing." Her breath came quicker but she plucked at the grass, not looking at at him. "It sounds bad," she agreed. "It is bad," he assured her seriously, reaching over to take her hand, "Gee, Enid, I'm head-over heels in love with you. Marry me, will you?" "Oh, Tom," she cried, "what about our plans for the future, your engineering and my teaching? I've got to pay Aunt Esther back for being so good to me. We're so young." "I know all those things, but somehow they don't matter. I've got enough engineering that I can make a living until I can save enough to go back to school. Someday, we'll both go back. But now...." He drew nearer to her, his eyes searching her face, "Look at me," he commanded, "try to deny that you love me." Her eyes were soft and shy as she looked at him, as she whispered: "T can't say I don't love you. I guess I knew it that first day I really noticed you." He laughed, indulgently. "I'd noticed you for a long time before 320 that. I was using mental suggestion on you. Finally, one day, you noticed me. Oh, happy day!" She felt the touch of his hand on hers and it was like a sudden charge of electricity. He leaned forward, whispering, "Say yes, my dear." "Tom.... Darling," She cried, in spite of herself, in spite of her reason, and she felt his lips upon hers, briefly, gently, wonderfully. When Aunt Esther gave her consent and full approval they went ahead with their plans. They were married simply, but rightly, in July, and since he had a promise of a job in his home town, they had come here to live. She didn't need to go over their days here, she couldn't. They were too close, too achingly close.. WAS darker now and she could hear the birds chirping in preparation for the coming night. She arose slowly, laboriously, and looked about the room. A great hunger for her child came over her. She took her wrap from the closet and started out to get her. The woman had said that she need only phone and she would bring her over, but Enid felt she would rather go out, walking, moving. The woman lived in the west part of town and not many would see her. Most people would be eating dinner, sitting around talking with one another, oblivious to the rest of the world.... As, oh, so recently, she had been oblivious to all else save her own little world. The wind whipped about her, stung her with a few drops of rain splashing against her face. But she hardly noticed, she walked with a Cd steady rhythm against the wind, against the oncoming darkness, against the hard, steady pain that was gnawing in her being. Mrs. Ranch, of the Relief Society, was very kind. She drew her into the warmth of her large, nicely furnished living room where Sharon was lying on the couch asleep, an expensive plaything still grasped in her little hand. Enid went over to her, stood looking down at her a moment before she sank on the couch beside her. Mrs. Ranch watched her, compassion and kindness in her face, which, though not very old, was framed by completely white hair. "My dear," she said, coming over to her, "I am so sorry for you, but I know you have the courage and the faith to go forward, to make a good life for your precious daughter. You must force yourself to be brave..." She said other things, but Enid hardly heard them. Somehow, she managed to smile, to say, "Yes. I know," politely. And, after what seemed an interminable time, with her child in her arms, she whispered, "Thank you so much," and left, started toward home. She walked slowly now, deep in thought, deep in sudden, overwhelming bitterness. "Make a good life'"?that was easy to say, easy to do, when one had a beautiful home like this woman's, when one had a prosperous and good husband. It was not so easy when one was suddenly left alone.... With nothing. Tom hadn't even carried insurance. Each week they had thought of taking out insurance but he would laugh and say, "I guess there's plenty of time for that." No, it wasn't easy, at twenty-three, FAITH IS A HERITAGE to have the entire world dissolve under one's feet, its music stilled, its hope ended, its beauty suddenly turned to ashes. She stopped a moment to catch her breath, to put Sharon down so that she might rest before starting up the street. Then she noticed that she was beside the river which ran through the town. She stood looking at it as one mesmerized, staring at the heavy, black, churning water. Usually there was not much water in the river bed, but today the storms in the mountains and the melting of the snows had brought the water to almost flood proportions. Debris and rocks were being carried rapidly along, being tossed about as if they were nothing at all. The turmoil, the angry grumbling of the water, matched the bitterness and tumult in her own heart. And she was glad for it. She wouldn't ever be hurt again. She moved a step forward toward the water as one who is attracted 321 by an evil power. She felt the darkness about her, clammy and thick and ominous. As one is awakened from sound sleeping, she heard the voice of her daughter calling, "Mommie, Mommie," felt the tug at her coat. The child looked up at her in need, in want of love and assurance. She looked down into the lifted, trusting, beautiful face. In that moment all the dark bitterness within her became as mist before the morning sun. She dropped to her knees, gathered the child against her, whispered, "Oh, my darling, my darling, I still have you. I will make a good life for you. Daddy would want me to do that." The child repeated the word, "Daddy..." and pointed up the street. But Enid only kissed her, assuring her still, "Daddy isn't there. But his spirit is, his faith and his courage. He left us those. Yes, we will go home now." (To be continued) MOTHER OF MINE Vernessa M.

The Magazine Honor Roll for 1945 Margaret C. Pickering, General Secretary-Treasurer UBSCRIPTIONS to the Magazine continue to show steady increase, based upon comparative total figures for December 1944 and 1945. In December 1945, a total of 74,- 032 copies of the Magazine were mailed as compared to 71,281 in December 1944, an increase of 2,- 751, or 3.86 per cent. Following the usual course, the honor roll, printed in this issue, recognizes all stakes, wards, missions and branches whose subscription rates equal or exceed 75 per cent. The 1945 honor roll contains more names than ever before?1102, an increase of 82, or 8.04 per cent over the preceding year. Following are the comparable figures for 1944 and 1945: appointed as Magazine representative, the name of the president appears. Great credit is due the supervisory stake, mission district, and mission Magazine representatives, and all of the ward and branch Magazine representatives who have done the arduous work of procuring subscriptions, with the assistance and support of Relief Society officers and members. To the Magazine representatives who have the responsibility of obtaining the subscriptions, and to all who assisted them, the General Board is very grateful. As an expression of its appreciation, the General Board is again awarding a free, one year Magazine subscription to all local representatives who procured subscriptions equal to 75 per cent of 1944 1945 Increase & Decrease No. Per cent Local Relief Societies In Stakes In Missions 245 Supervisory Organizations 101 Stakes Missions 6 7 7 2 + 16.66 Mission Districts Total on Honor Roll 1020 The honor roll is arranged in alphabetical order and the name of the Magazine representative appears opposite the name and record of each Relief Society listed. In those instances where no one is Page 322 the ward or branch Relief Society enrollment as of the end of 1945, and to all stake, mission district, and mission Magazine representatives appearing on the honor roll. The Magazine honor roll is based THE MAGAZINE HONOR ROLL FOR 1945 on subscription reports submitted to the General Board. However, the British, Hawaiian, Northern California, and South African Missions (of the English-speaking missions ) failed to submit subscription _reports for 1945. Also, a few districts of some of the reporting missions failed to respond?1 in the California Mission, and 5 in the Northern States. Reference to the annual Relief Society reports compiled by the secretaries indicated that the unreported missions had local Relief Societies with rates entitling them to a position on the honor roll and they were, therefore, included. However, none is included from the British, Hawaiian, New Zealand, or South African Missions from which no report had been received by press time. We take special pleasure in congratulating the 18 stakes,  323 mission, and 7 mission districts with Magazine subscription rates of 100 per cent or more. Of this number 8 stakes and 5 mission districts are making their first appearance in the highest ranking group. In the local Relief Societies, 511 of the 992 on the honor roll achieved rates of 100 per cent or more. These hundred _percenters constituted 50.46 per cent or 385 of the 763 award-winning wards in stakes and 55.02 per cent or 126 of 229 award winning mission branches. The excellent records are due in many instances to the fact that some mission and stake Relief Societies have had unusual opportunities to place the Magazine in the hands of investigators and non-members. The local societies with exceptionally high rates appear on the following page.

Jordan Nampa Nevada San Fernando Sugarhouse Uvada THE MAGAZINE HONOR ROLL FOR 1945 Achievements of Missions In the missions, four of the six which appeared on the 1944 honor roll maintained their positions in 1945, namely, Australian, Southern States, Western Canadian, and Western States. The Northern States Mission did not reach the quota this year. The report from the South African Mission did not reach the office in time to be included in this report. Three new missions made the honor roll this year Canadian, North Central and Northwestern. The Australian Mission still leads the stakes and missions of the Church with 140 per cent. The 1944 honor roll showed 24 mission districts. The 1945 honor roll shows 22 mission districts of which the following maintained their 1944 rating: South Coast and Mojave Desert of Califormia Mission; Central Indiana, Central Ohio, and Wisconsin of Northern States Mission; -Northern Montana of Northwestern States Mission; Central Florida, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, South Alabama, South Carolina, South Florida, South Georgia, West Florida, and West South Carolina of the Southern States. Six new mission districts were added this year: Las Flores of the California mission, North and South Illinois of Northern States Mission; Central Oregon, Great Falls, and Yakima of Northwestern States Mission; and North Texas 325 of the Texas-Lousiana Mission. Six of the districts on the honor roll in 1944 failed to qualify for this year? San Gorganio and Santa Barbara of the California Mission; East Michigan, South Ohio, and West Michigan of the Northern States Mission; and South Louisiana of the Texas- - Louisiana Mission. In addition to the stakes, missions, and mission districts in which local Relief Societies attained rates sufficient to place the entire area on the honor roll, 64 stakes and 8 missions are represented not by a rating for the stake or mission as a whole, but by one or more of their local Relief Societies which attained honor-roll status. Accordingly, a total of 145 stakes (all but 7) or 95.39 per cent and of 19 English speaking missions, 15 (all but 4) or 78.95 per cent are represented on the 1945 honor roll by one or more local Societies. Reports from the British, Hawaiian, New Zealand, and South African Missions had not reached the office at the time of this report. We tegret that the Carbon and Portland Stakes, which were on the honor roll in 1944, are not represented this year by even one ward. The General Board expresses its deep appreciation of the splendid results attained during one of the most stressful periods of history? the climax of the war and its aftermath.

After sixteen years the Church built an institute and chapel. We now have a beautiful building to meet in, with the use of an entertainment room, library, and study halls. "Each year we have observed March 17th with an appropriate program and entertainment. This year (1945) a covered dish dinner was served in the evening to twenty-eight members and their husbands. Four large tables were set and decorated, one for each season of the year. Persons whose birthdays occurred in a certain season were seated at that particular table. Sister Marjean Hunter Wall took first place for her prize-winning winter decorations. Point-free hot dishes took the place of meat and four large birthday cakes were served. Janet Partridge sang two solos and a talk on the organization of the first Relief Society was given by Elizabeth Foster and a reading by Elizabeth Anderson. "During the summer we will meet twice a month, once for work and business and once for recreation, also for a pioneer day celebration and a park picnic. The mothers and daughters held their first banquet in this ward June 19, 1945. Over sixty were present. All members are good and willing workers and we have plenty of good times along with our work. Each year we hold a rummage sale. We made $130 on the last sale. Out in the mission our work has been hard at times, but now we are organized as a ward in the Denver Stake. Relief Society is indeed a help to all who attend. The Lord has blessed us here. May he bless all the organizations throughout the world." Me ELIZABETH A. BENNETT Malad Stake, Malad Second Ward Malad Stake (Idaho) Malad Second Ward ' AMELIA W. SPENCER, teacher trainer, Malad Second Ward, reports an unusual record in the visiting teachers' program: "Recently when our Malad Second Ward Relief Society was reorganized, the new presidency and the bishopric met together with all the visiting teachers, and every teacher was given a blessing and set apart for her work. "As our bishop, W. W. Thomas, interviewed each teacher, it was found that many of them have marvelous service records. One, especially, has a record of fifty-eight years of continuous service in the Relief Society. NOTES FROM THE FIELD "Sister Elizabeth A. Bennett was born in England in 1864. She was baptized into the Church in 1881, and arrived in Salt Lake City in 1883 with her young baby. Her husband, John A. Bennett, had come to the Valley two months earlier. When she was twenty years old, Elizabeth Bennett joined her first Relief Society and, in June 1888, she was set apart as a teacher in the Relief So- 347 city at Albion, Idaho, and has served in various ways in the Relief Society ever since, which gives her a record of fifty-eight years of service. She is now eighty-one years young and visits her district every month. I cautioned her to be careful and not overdo her strength, and she said: 'Does it ever injure anyone to do her duty in the Church?' This is typical of her spirit."

Vaughn Larsen, a high councilman, sang "Face to Face," accompanied by Vera K. Cole of Fairview Ward. Talks were given by Bertha Woodward, counselor in the Franklin Ward, on the organization of the Relief Society, and by Mildred Anderson of the Preston Second Ward on the contributions which the Relief Society offers to the women of today. Sister Anderson closed her remarks with a very _ beautiful original poem, the last lines of which are: Relief Society! All hail to thee! Thy praise we sing this day; May your banner of love and service Be the guide that lights our way. "At the close of the program each ward officer was presented with a corsage by the stake board members and departmental work was carried out by the stake officers."

Weiser Stake (Idaho) McCall Ward FROM Weiser Stake, where Sister Erma B. Chadwick is president of the Relief Society, a report of the ambitious workers in McCall Ward comes from the Secretary Marjorie Willis: "The McCall Relief Society was organized December 18, 1943, with five women who later became officers and active members. The sisters have been willing workers and always co-operative, each desirous to work for the Society and not for herself. Last August we had two cooked food sales from which we netted twenty-eight dollars. We also have completed one quilt.

Sister Burdett has most generously offered her home for the use of our meetings. It was in her home that the Society was organized. Last month we received a visit from a stake board member and honored her with a luncheon at_ Sister Burdett's home." Bannock Stake (Idaho) LIZA B. CHRISTIANSEN, president Bannock Stake Relief Society, submits, as part of a very interesting report of the well-directed activities in her stake, some helpful suggestions regarding Thewhich were compiled by Ida Sorenson, stake magazine agent: "In behalf of the stake board, I earnestly urge you to read and study the Magazine, thereby receiving the benefits the General Board intended you should. Come to class well prepared and able to take part in the ? discussion. Read the wonderful stories published in each Magazine. Let us read and study that we may become more enlightened and better qualified to carry on our work. Presidents, why not have a quiz in your meetings for a few minutes about the contents of each new Magazine the week after it arrives? See if this doesn't get your members interested in reading it" Uintah Stake (Utah) Vernal Third Ward ROM Uintah Stake, under the presidency of Mae T. Johnson, an unusual accomplishment in securing Magazine subscriptions has been reported. Vernal Third Ward has achieved 122 per cent subscriptions for the 1945 quota. This NOTES FROM THE FIELD high percentage was secured largely through the efforts of Sister Alice Billings, ward Magazine representative, who is over eighty years old. Sarah H. Richardson, stake Magazine representative, sends the following note regarding Sister Billings: "Sister Billings was born in Provo, Utah, December 25, 1865, a daughter of Evert Orser Mecham. She mained Alfred N. Billings, October 1 5, 1889. They made their home in Jensen, Utah. Eight children were born to them, six of whom are living and actively engaged in Church work. Sister Billings has been a widow for twenty years. She joined the Relief Society at the age of eighteen and served in several capacities in various wards until 1923, when she was made president of the Glines Ward Relief Society. She served in this office for six years, until she completely Jost her hearing, At Present she is a ALICE BILLINGS Uintah Stake, Vernal Third Ward representative in the Vernal Third Ward.

Comments from Magazine Readers With this belated renewal subscription, I must write a few words of appreciation for mys, and for the women of goodness, talent, intelligence and inspiration who lead and have led the women of the Church. The contents of the Magazine are so varied and far-reaching. It always offers intelligent and inspirational reading especially in times of illness or when one needs comfort, strength or courage. ?Glendale, Calif. I am a faithful reader of your Magazine and I do enjoy it immensely. You are doing a fine job and I personally want to thank you for such a fine magazine. ?Ogden, Utah I appreciate your Magazine very much.

Your 8 1/3 cents a month is a very small price to pay for such a fine women's magazine. ?Moscow, Idaho I have been a subscriber of your wonderful little Magazine for years, the best little book that comes into a home with four teen-age children who always read it before I ever get a chance. Just wouldn't be without it. Payson, Utah I have always enjoyed reading the Magazine for it is very uplifting and a character builder for any individual. The sisters should make an effort to live up to the many teachings that are written in the book. Wailuku, Maui, T. H. For about thirty-five years I have been an appreciative silent reader. When I lived on a homestead many years ago, the Magazine was such a welcome visitor, as it still is. Many otherwise long, lonely hours slipped by while I was absorbed in some cheery story or interesting lesson outline. I was really grateful for the diversion the Magazine afforded me. I do not want to miss any of the Magazines. They are a great help and an inspiration to me both spiritually and temporally. I am proud to say I have sent in subscriptions for fourteen out of the sixteen families in my visiting district. ?West Los Angeles, Calif.

I have long been a careful reader of Theand have found it to be a source of great inspiration and help to me, and I congratulate you on the quality of the material and the splendid arrangement of the same that is found in each issue. One could almost say the Magazine never "faileth." Logan, Utah Thecertainly has always been most helpful to Utah writers, and I always feel honored to have anything of mine published in the Magazine.-?Ogden, Utah President Louise Y. Robison (Continued from page 297) Then said Sister Robison: "I wonder if there is anyone here who does not need the human touch. I wonder if there is a woman in the Church who, through the Relief Society, has not the opportunity of watching the one hour with those who are bearing heavy burdens. Sisters, you have been given that privilege, you can comfort and _ bless souls." E know she will enter on her new work "over there" with her head high, with eyes sparkling, with the enthusiastic zeal which characterized her work here, and with the same sweet humility which kept her always close to her Father in heaven. "Faith, hope and love, but the greatest of these is love." Sister Robison has great faith, a simple, absolute faith. She knows that God lives. She knows the gospel is true. I quote her again: "T believe firmly that the Gospel of Jesus Christ, a testimony that God lives, is the anchor that holds us and makes us feel secure." That was the message she always wished the Board Members to take to the stakes. "But God has spoken," she would say. "Let us make the women feel that God has spoken and that it behooves all to listen when Jehovah speaks." Great faith she had and hope and confidence. Love, the greatest of all gifts, she had in a superlative LOUISE Y. ROBISON degree. The great love she gave came back to her. One hears on every side, "Sister Robison will go down in history as the most beloved woman in the Church." She loved her family with a tender love. To hear her but speak their names was a joy, she put so much of pride and love into it. She loved her friends and how loyal she was _ to them. She loved children. That any child should go through life handicapped for lack of medical or dental care or proper food, was to her intolerable. "Don't let a child suffer," she would plead. "If you haven't the money in your ward or stake, let me know and somehow I will find it." She loved people. At a party given by her Board Members on her birthday a year ago, Sister Nellie Parker paid her this beautiful tribute: One of the outstanding strengths of Sister Robison's leadership is her ability to put the arms of her love around even the most timid and inexperienced women and give them confidence in themselves and create within them a zealousness for the cause. She is able to draw out their best abilities and win their love and cooperation... She is enshrined in the hearts of those women who served her from Canada to Mexico, from Hawaii to Europe. She loved the gospel. Deeply concerned as she was that no one should suffer for want of the material necessities of life, she also had that most precious of all gifts, the understanding heart, the ability to sense the spiritual needs of those who came to her discouraged, in sorrow,-in doubt, or with faith faltering. And, coupled with this rare gift of seeing, she had the gift of giving that which was needed. I 357 have seen women come to her office, crushed, despondent, and I have seen them leave with the light of hope and faith rekindled. How much this gift is needed today. If every woman in the Church could radiate spirituality as did Sister Robison, what a light we would be to the world. She loved her work in the Church. To her it was never a duty to be performed, but a glorious, joyous opportunity which she welcomed. Can you not hear her say, "Welcome the task that takes you beyond yourself?" In the early days of the Church when our Heavenly Father was "raising up a people who would serve him in righteousness" ? a people who would be faithful enough and strong enough to carry on his work in these last days, he told them the qualifications needed for such a people. How often he emphasized, "Serve with an eye single to the glory of God." No one who thinks of honor to self is wholly devoted to a cause. But when one loses self in devotion to a great cause, that is one of the forms of superlative greatness; in fact, there can be no true greatness without it. "He who loses his life shall find it." This greatest of all tributes we pay to Sister Robison. She had the greatest of all gifts? love. She truly served with an eye single to the glory of God. To her family I wish to say, speaking for the women of the Church, that we love her. Her sweet influence will live on in our hearts forever. Our prayer is that we may so live, so carry on, that again some day she will be our leader. Work Meeting Grosgrain Ribbon Handbag 1. MATERIAL REQUIRED: 9 yards grosgrain ribbon 14 inches wide, 2. CUTTING: 1/3 yard lining, sheet wadding. Suggested materials Taffeta, crepe, rayon satin. (A) Cut sixteen 9% inch lengths of ribbon. (B) Cut two 30 inch lengths of ribbon.
