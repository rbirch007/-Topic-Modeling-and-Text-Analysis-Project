MEADOW LARK Roberta Bates A meadow lark sits at my gate and sings, Melody pouring from his swollen throat, Begging for alms. What alms could I bring? A ransom of kings would not repay a note. In his black necktie and his gold-flecked coat, His vanity thrilling with each vain word, He distills the air with melodious rote, "Meadow lark, meadow lark, pretty bird!"
