Optional Lessons in Lieu of Literature The Gospel as a Way of Life Lesson 2 The General Gospel Plan Elder T. Edgar Lyon For Tuesday, November 19, 1946 S pointed out in the lesson *" last month, one great principle which we struggled to maintain in the pre-existence was that of individual free agency. As a necessary step for the utilization of this principle, the earth was created and we were given mortal existence. Earth life thus became, in reality, a laboratory in which mortals were to | exercise the gift of free agency in the choice of good and evil. We believed in this plan so intently that we accepted the responsibility of earth life without any guarantee of our ultimate exaltation. It was a time "when the morning stars sang together, and the sons of God shouted for joy" (Job 38:7). Mankind was thus placed upon the earth to pass through a period of apprenticeship that would be a preparation for the next step in eternal progression. Certain things were expected of those who accepted mortality. First, obedience to the commandments of God was anticipated. And one that was like unto God had said, "And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them" (Abraham 3:25). From this scripture it is evident that obedience to divine law is the first requirement for readmittance into the presence of God, but it is merely the minimum requirement.   A second obligation in connection with the use of free agency and its exercise is that of taking the initiative to do more than give mere obedience to specific commandments. The Lord has instructed us to watch for opportunities to render service to others and assume the responsibility of taking the initiative in such matters. For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward. Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness; For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And _ inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward. But he that doeth not anything until he is commanded and receiveth a commandment with doubtful heart, and keepeth it with slothfulness, the same is damned... (Doc. And Cov. 58:26-29). This scripture is positive in its teaching that the Lord requires us to do more than merely observe commandments. We must be prepared to go "the second mile" (Matt. 5:41). There is a third item that needs to be observed in connection with LESSON DEPARTMENT our earthly probation. It is the attitude of mind that we should have toward life itself and the problems that present themselves in the course of life. Instead of viewing life as a mournful burden to be tolerated but not enjoyed, God would have us take an optimistic view of life, and rejoice in the process of seeking salvation. The Book of Mormon prophet, Jacob, expressed this idea as follows: Therefore, cheer up your hearts, and remember that ye are free to act for yourselves to choose the way of everlasting death or the way of eternal life (II Nephi 10:23). In this dispensation the Lord reiterated this doctrine through the Prophet Joseph Smith. In speaking of observing the Lord's day and other religious requirements, the revelation reads in part, "... Do these things with thanksgiving, with cheerful hearts and countenances..." (Doc. And Cov. 59:15). A fourth obligation of free agents who have accepted the gospel is to be diligent in the use of their agency for the welfare of the Church. Although the Lord has placed inspired leadership at the head of the Church, there is also a strong element of democracy in it. Ordinations to the Priesthood, selection of officers, and other functions demand that the inspired nominations by the appointed leaders be ratified or rejected by the membership. It is a fundamental teaching of the Lord to the Church that "And all things shall be done by common consent in the Church.. 2" (Doc and Cov. 26:2; see also 28:13). This teaching demands that each free agent 567 exercise his agency in the sustaining or rejecting of these propositions. One of our latter-day prophets, John Taylor, had very positive opinions concerning the use of his agency. He viewed it not only as a God-given blessing, but also as something that he was required to use to the best of his ability. The following quotation is indicative of his attitude: I have felt very decided... Ever since I could comprehend anything; that I would worship God as I pleased, without anybody's dictation, and that I would dictate to no man his faith, neither should any man dictate to me my faith... (B. H. Roberts, Life of John Taylor, pp. 422, 423). From the foregoing scriptural quotations and observations, it is apparent that the free agency of man is a divine principle. Furthermore, it places on mankind a tremendous responsibility for all human conduct. Few of us seem to fully sense either the true value of agency or our responsibility to make an intelligent use of it. In his letter to the saints at Rome, the apostle Paul defined the gospel of Christ as "... The power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth..." (Rom. 1:16). Brigham Young stated this idea with great clarity when he said: The Gospel of the Son of God that has been revealed is a plan or system of laws and ordinances, by strict obedience to which the people who inhabit this earth are assured that they may return again into the presence of the Father and the Son (Discourses of Brigham Young, page 1). These statements indicate that there are two elements in the gospel one is the saving power of 568 God, the other is the effort that people put forth to make their lives conform to God's Prescribed way of living, A thoughtful reading of the scriptures indicates that Christ was not teaching a mere system of belief. His message demanded action. Recall the parables of the good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37); the prodigal son (Luke 1511-32); the lost sheep (Luke 15:3-7); and the lost coin (Luke 15:8-10); and many others. Each parable demonstrates that Work is required of the true Christan. The man who fell among thieves on the Jericho road was not helped until the Samaritan rendered service. The Prodigal son was not benefited until he made the decision to return to his father. The lost sheep was not found until the shepherd went after it. The lost coin was recovered only after the woman swept the house and sought diligently for it. One of the frequent admonitions of Jesus, at the conclusion of a parable or illustration was, "Go, and do thou likewise" (Luke 10:37), The gospel of Christ is thus, in reality, a Way of living and acting, instead of just a way Of believing. The goal of mortal existence is to struggle upward through obedience to God's commands, the rendering of service, and belief in God and Christ, to a state of exaltation. Jesus had this in mind when he said, "Be ve therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect (Matt. 5:48). We its fulness. It was not until after the atonement of Jesus was completed, that the gospel plan was finally consummated. It is for this reason that we should fee] especially blessed to be allowed to come to earth in this, the dispensation of the fulness of times, when the knowledge of all former gospel ages has been revealed to us. "If you are relaxation, and ease, to say nothing earth." He probably thought he was witty, but he really spoke the truth. Some of the most appealing teachings of the Restored Church are those of never-ending development, opportunity for creative activity, and Progression toward a state of godhood. Many people, however, view these interesting ideals as things that are to be confined to the hereafter. The true interpretation that the gospel teaches us, however, is that today and yesterday are just as much a part of eternity as any day that is to come. This concept, if properly understood, should stimulate each Church member, each day, to make the most of his opportunities for Progress, service, and development. In discussing this interpretation, Brigham Young said:  and destroy yourselves, if you - + + I do not believe that the Lord delights in people who wish to die before they have accomplished the work that he designed for them to do... Instead of Preparing to die, Prepare to live in the midst of all the exaltations of the Gods. We are organized for the ex. LESSON DEPARTMENT press purpose of controlling the elements, of organizing and disorganizing, of ruling over kingdoms, principalities, and powers, and yet our affections are often too highly placed upon paltry, perishable objects. We love houses, gold, silver, and various kinds of property, and all who unduly prize any object there is beneath the celestial world are idolators. (Discourses of Brigham Young, pp. 135, 136, 137; 1941 Ed. Pp. 88, 89, go). President Joseph F. Smith aptly said: Some people dream... And teach that all the glory they ever expect to have in the world to come is to sit in the light and glory of the Son of God, and sing praises and songs of joy and gratitude all their immortal lives. We do not believe in any such things. We believe that every man will have his work to do in the other world, just as surely as he had it to do here, and a greater work than he can do here. We believe that we are on the road of advancement, of development in knowledge, in understanding, and in every good thing, and that we will continue to grow, advance, and develop throughout the eternities that are before us (Gospel Doctrine, page 453). The ultimate goal that we hope to achieve is the blessed state described in the Doctrine and Covenants. They are they who are priests and kings, who have received of his fulness. And of his glory; and are priests of the Most High, after the order of Melchizedek, which was after the order of Enoch, which was after the order of the Only Begotten Son. Wherefore, as it is written, they are gods, even the sons of God'? (Doc. And Cov. 76:56-58). 569 Then shall they be gods, because they have no end; therefore shall they be from everlasting to everlasting, because they continue; then shall they be above all, because all things are subject unto them. Then shall they be gods, because they have all power, and the angels are subject unto them (Doc. And Cov. 132:20). Discussion and Activity Problems 1. Why is it a good thing that our memory of the pre-existent state is taken from us during mortality?. What is required beyond obedience to the specific commandments of the gospel?. What do we mean when we say that the gospel is eternal? 4. Why do. You suppose the Latter-day Saints teach that heaven is a place of continued activity rather than a place of rest? 5- Have a class member read the words of song No. 37 in L. DS. Hymns, "Know This, that Every Soul Is Free." 6. If the lesson is properly presented, the sisters should be stimulated by its central thoughts to express their gratitude, during the discussion, for their agency and their hope for exaltation in the life to come.
