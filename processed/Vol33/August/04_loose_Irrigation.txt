irrigation, presenting at the same time advantageous sites for the erection of mills. These ravines abound in timber in quantities sufficient for fuel and building purposes. Looking for more grazing land, President Brigham Young and other Church leaders established the Church ranch, or farm, in 1855-56, between the places where Wellsville and Logan were later settled. Seven men and two women spent the first hard winter there. These were the first women to reside in Cache Valley, and they showed the great fortitude and patience typical of all Mormon pioneer women under trying circumstances.   Sister William A. Warner and Sister Stolworthy fed the men, grinding the wheat in coffee mills and making it into gruel. When food ran out, Brother Dowdle set out on foot for more. He returned with one sack of flour. Sister Warner writes: Out of my share of flour  one half pound a day I saved one cupful a week and it came in handy when conditions became even worse. Sister Stolworthy's baby was the first to be born in Cache Valley. The first house in Cache Valley was also built at this ranch in August 1855. During this first winter there were three thousand head of cattle at the ranch, and of the two thousand owned by the Church only four hundred twenty survived the winter snow which was four and one half feet deep on the level and ten feet deep in the canyons. To mention the name of Peter Maughan is to recall the real beginning of Cache Valley settlement. In 1856, he was chosen by President Brigham Young to take a small colony into the valley, where he arrived September 15, 1856, with his wife and sons, W. H., and John M., also Zial Riggs, George Ryan, Francis Gennel, and O. D. Thompson, and families. They settled at what is now Wellsville, and, September 27, a child was born to Mrs. Peter Maughan. This child was considered to be the first child born in Cache Valley until the journal of Sister Warner came to light. The Maughan child was born in a covered wagon after the first snowfall. Because of Indian trouble and the difficulties occasioned by the entrance of Johnston's army into Utah, these colonists moved into Southern Utah, but returned in 185g. It is interesting to note that Sister Maughan mentions in her journal that her chairs had been scattered all over, but that otherwise they found things much as they had left them. After 1859, the permanent settlement of Cache Valley began in earnest. In June of that year, thirtyfive families moved to the vicinity of Logan and began its settlement. Some of the prominent people in this enterprise were Hezekiah Thatcher, financier; William B. Preston, first bishop; Ezra T. Benson, colonel of the "minute men," and first stake president; and Edward W. Smith, the first school teacher. Among the many interesting incidents connected with early Logan history, it is worth mentioning that on March 7, 1870, the third election was held, and 265 votes were cast, fifty by women. THE FIRST RELIEF SOCIETY HOUSE IN MENDON, CACHE VALLEY CACHE VALLEY PART OF THE MORMON EPIC 511 PETER MAUGHAN This is indicative of the important part women have played in Mormondom. The fact that Logan very early prohibited the sale of liquor is also evidence of the high type of citizenship there. APOSTLE WILFORD WOOD.- RUFF visited Logan, in 1863, with President Brigham Young, and, noticing the people lined up on either side of the street to welcome them, was inspired to prophesy that a temple would be built in Logan. President Young said the prophecy would be fulfilled. Its fulfillment was begun May 18, 1877, when President Young and his counselors came to Logan to break ground for the temple. The stately edifice was dedicated May 17, 1884, by President John Taylor. The $608,000 structure was a monument to the sacrifice and co-operation of the pioneers of this section who, during the same period, built the tabernacle, which still stands on the beautiful square in the heart of the city. Logan has always been an outstanding educational and recreational center, and, even in this brief article, we must mention the establishment of Brigham Young College in 1877, and the Utah State Agricultural College, in 1890. Both schools began inauspiciously but grew rapidly and have done much good in Cache Valley. In 1858, the colony of Mendon was founded, and it is interesting to read how, in 1874, Mendon reported that its people could not go into the United Order until their bishop, Henry Hughes, returned from his mission. Then apostle Snow very quickly and effectively asked the question if the kingdom of God had to stop in Mendon because Bishop Hughes was on a mission. This settled the matter, and the Order was at once established, one third of the people being in the Order and two-thirds out. The people who joined the Order put in all they had, and all were paid according to the days they worked, no matter what they had contributed. Richmond was established in 1859, with Brother Bair and others in charge. Also, in the same year, Smithfield was settled, with John G. Smith as the first bishop. The town was named in his honor. In 1860, Hyrum was settled, being named Hyrum because it was in CACHE VALLEY PART OF THE MORMON EPIC a direct line with a proposed settlement at the Church farm which was to have been named Joseph. This settlement did not materialize. Also, in this same year, Millville and Hyde Park were established. Clarkston was settled in 1864, and is the burial place of Martin Harris who died in 1875. In 1869, Newton was settled, and, in 1870, Lewiston was established. Severe frosts killed the grain in July for three successive years, and very much discouraged the settlers in Lewiston. However, they persisted and now have a rich, thriving community. Benson was begun in 1871, Trenton in 1872, and College Ward in 1879. Franklin, the most northerly of the Cache Valley settlements, was begun in the spring of 1860. It holds the distinction of being the first permanent settlement in Idaho, but, in the beginning, was considered to be in Utah territory. In 1865, Weston was established, the first settlement in Cache Valley on the west side of Bear River. In 1877, Preston was settled at the end of the Utah Northern railroad, and it soon became the leading town in northern Cache Valley. The settlement of Cache Valley was very rapid, especially during the year 1860. As this valley had been the hunting ground of various Indian tribes, they moved through the settlements as the seasons changed and caused a good deal of trouble. The saints tried to handle their problem in several ways. First, they tried to follow the advice of President Brigham Young by attempting to feed rather than to fight the Indians. At the same time they built their communities in the form 513 of forts for protection. Also, they maintained armed "minute men" under Colonel Ezra T. Benson. In spite of all these precautions, a few children were stolen, and some of the settlers lost their lives. One of the bloodiest engagements between the white men and the Indians took place at Battle Creek, near Franklin. Hundreds of Indians and many of General Connor's men were killed. The following account of one settlement was typical of all: During the first season they built for themselves homes (usually log with sod roofs and in fort formation), planted and harvested crops of grain and vegetables, constructed roads into the canyons so they could get what timber and firewood they needed, dug a small irrigation canal, and erected a log school and meeting house.

Only whole-hearted co-operation and hard work, fired by faith in Photograph by R. M. Brown God and in their leaders and their religion, made it possible to establish the colonies in Cache Valley, as well as in all other parts of Mormondom. THE LOGAN TEMPLE IN SPRING
