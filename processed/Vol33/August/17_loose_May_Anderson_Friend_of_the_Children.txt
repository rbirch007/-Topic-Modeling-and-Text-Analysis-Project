May Anderson Friend of the Children 1864 - 1946 THE General Board of Relief Society, on behalf of the membership in all the stakes and missions of the Church, pays tribute at this time to the memory of Sister May Anderson. Long devoted to the service of children, Sister Anderson passed away June 10, 1946, at the age of eighty-two. She served the Primary Association with great devotion for forty-eight years, acting as secretary of the General Board, as a counselor, and, from 1925 to 1939, as general president. Under her enthusiastic and untiring direction, the Children's Friend was founded; her energy and her vision were largely responsible for the success of the Primary Children's Hospital. Sister Anderson's interests were varied, her talents outstanding. Thousands of children and their parents remember May Anderson with love and gratitude. Her influence and her sympathetic service will be of lasting benefit to the organization which she served so well, and to all who are devoted to the welfare of children. - Page 535
