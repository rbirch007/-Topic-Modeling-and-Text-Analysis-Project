Night Callers Gladys Dewey VERY crack in the long, one-room log cabin had been covered. From the outside not one tiny slit of light could be seen. Nancy Parker fitted her white shawl comfortably around her shoulders and settled herself in her bees wax polished oak rocker. John and Martha had been put to bed, and everything was in readiness. All she could do now was wait. Her deep blue eyes wandered over the long room that had been her home for almost three years, falling first on the much-used flour sack that stood upright in the shadows behind the door, bulging with essentials. In it were a pair of homespun trousers John had outgrown, a dress Martha had worn, some red and yellow beads, an old, but still usable, coat of her husband's, and on top lay a mound of sweet cookies. They were all the right gifts. Nancy had filled that same sack so many times that she knew just what it should contain. At a murmured sound from Martha, her eyes darted to the place where two curly-haired children lay cuddled in a deep feather mattress, lying on the spotlessly clean pineboard floor. A multicolored patchwork quilt was over them. Satisfied that the children were both asleep, Nancy leaned her head against the back of her chair and watched the light from the crackling pine log in the fireplace as it played along the dark, low ceiling. She was very thankful for the fire. The day had been cloudy and chilly, but she Page 522 had not dared to build a fire, for smoke could be seen or smelled even though the cabin was far below the Indian village high up in the mist covered mountains. Having smoke coming from the chimney, if the Indians had seen Jim Parker's wagon leave, would be inviting trouble, for they would know that Nancy was alone. Night had come early and settled with foggy darkness so thick it seemed you would be able to reach out and touch it. Knowing that smoke could not penetrate such an atmosphere, she had hurriedly lit the fire. Not being one to sit with folded hands, Nancy took her knitting from the basket on the table beside her and began another row on her husband's socks. Jim Parker had gone on his yearly journey to the county seat. Pine City was forty miles away and it took three days to make the trip one day to go, one to transact his business and buy supplies for the winter, and one day to return. This was the first time that Nancy had not been with him, but the distance was too long, and the weather too uncertain to take the children, Martha, six, and John, eight. % * * In preparing for the trip, Jim had hitched his big bays, Maud and Pat, to his covered wagon loaded with feed for the team and a roll of bedding for himself. Before leaving, he had glanced at his watch, then scanned the heavens. If the NIGHT CALLERS late October sky had not been covered with a solid mass of dingy gray clouds, the sun would have been just peeking over the rim of the mountain, to splash in through the small window onto the children's bed. But that morning John and Martha had been up and dressed, listening carefully to every instruction their father had given them. Good-byes had been said and Nancy had stood in front of the cabin, holding each of the children - by the hand, until her husband had _ disappeared around the bend in the road, John had then withdrawn his hand from his mother's, for hadn't father made him head of the house during his absence? Then, with his shoulders thrown back, and his blue eyes sparkling with the magnitude of his new responsibility, he had looked at his mother and small sister, and echoed a phrase of his father's, "Time's a passing, so better get to our chores." Nancy had smiled at her children and gone into the cabin to "get to her chores," while John had hurried down the path toward the woodpile with six-year-old Martha coming on behind as fast as her short, stubby legs would let her. Jim Parker had sawed and split a huge pile of white pine and maple for the children to put in the lean-to shed just around the northern comer of the cabin. John had begun loading a pile of the big chunks in the crook of his arm, while Martha gathered the small kindling pieces. Back and forth they had gone until not one chunk was left. Then, tucking her long, black curls further under her bright red cap, Martha 523 had followed her brother as he fed the cows and pigs. Feeding the chickens had been their last chore. When John, imitating his father, had given her the task, Martha gleefully began laying tiny handfuls of wheat in a wide circle, counting each one, to be sure each of the fourteen fowls had her own share. Late in the afternoon Nancy had helped her son feed and milk the cows. Back in the cabin, Nancy had frequently left her work to glance through the window at the children, to assure herself that they were all tight. Although she had lived as a neighbor to the Indians for three years, she was still nervous when the children were out of the cabin. Her work had gone more smoothly after John and Martha had come in, early in the evening, removed their coats and toboggan caps, and sat by the fireplace carefully turning the pages of an old mail-order catalogue which Nancy had brought with her from Indiana. SUDDENLY Nancy's thoughts were interrupted. Dropping her knitting, she riveted her eyes on the heavily bolted door, shaken by loud knocking. Fear seized her and she gripped the arms of her chair. The knocking sounded again. Nancy arose and: went to the door, Sliding back the bolt, she felt certain she knew what she would see outside, and glanced at the gift-filled flour sack. But, instead of a begging old squaw croaking, "Give biscuit, Shoshone hungry," a tall, willow-straight Indian came into the room, rolled by two blanketed braves. The firelight sparkled in and out among the beads around his 524 magnificent headdress of many colored feathers, which rippled almost to the floor. The awe-inspiring presence of the great chief of the Shoshone Indians was terrifying to the small, dark-haired pioneer woman who stood before him. Chief Many Feathers spoke first. "White squaw go. Take papoose, or� Nancy's trembling lips parted to ask why. The chief went on, "Evil god of white man come. Descend for many days on Shoshone Chief wigwam. White man go, take evil one from body of Little Star." Nancy had never seen Little Star, but she knew she was the chief's daughter. The chief stood proudly erect, his arms folded, but his somber eyes were full of sorrow, an emotion unbefitting to a chief. Every pioneer had heard of the cruelties of some of the Indians, the Shoshone included. Nancy knew her position was precarious. There was but one thing to do. Guided by the same spirit that had made her a pioneer, she looked straight at Chief Many Feathers and said, "White squaw come, take care of Little Star, make her well again." Nancy could feel the eyes of the three tribesmen as they gazed at her. Many Feathers refused. "No, White squaw go. Take away evil one.". Desperation driving her on, Nancy began telling the chief what to do for his child. He listened as she explained each step, then he said, "White squaw come." The young mother quickly awakened her children, explaining what had happened as she helped them dress. Chief Many Feathers and his braves stood silent and erect near the door watching Nancy and her children. When John and Martha were dressed, Nancy put on her own coat and tied a blue shawl over her hair. She hurriedly took a clean, small bag from a shelf covered by brightly flowered calico curtains, and began filling it with all the things she would need. Before blowing out the lamp, she glanced around the cabin. Her eyes noticed the sack in the comer, but fearing to offend the Chief, she left it. Nancy followed Chief Many Feathers out the door with her children; the two braves came last. Stepping out into the night air, she noted with surprise that the heavy fog had lifted, and a small, pale moon showed through the clouds. The climb to the Shoshone village was an easy one. The chief, followed by his braves, led the way. Nancy came behind with John and Martha. None of the Indians offered any assistance; assisting a squaw would have been beneath the dignity of either a chief or a brave. Knowing this, Nancy did not expect help. The chief climbed silently and swiftly. The braves followed close behind him. The moon lighted the smooth, gently curving path. Nancy and the children moved almost as quietly as their escorts. But their pace was so swift, and the air so crisp, that soon it became difficult for them to breathe, and they fell some distance behind. Not until the Indians had reached NIGHT CALLERS the crest of the mountain did Chief Many Feathers look back. Standing tall, with folded arms, his face serene, he resembled a mighty statue in the moonlight as he waited for them to catch up. CHIEF MANY FEATHERS led -~ the way down into his village, then into a large, deerskin-covered wigwam. Near the fire lay a pile of furs and on top of them lay Little Star, with her mother, Yellow Blossom, sitting beside her. The child had the brown-skinned beauty of the Shoshone. Her hair was shining black and smooth; long braids lay on the dark furs beside her hot, drawn face. She breathed rapidly. Nancy fell on her knees beside the little Indian girl. She knew at once what must be done. Motioning to John, she instructed him to take the contents of the small, white bag and set them beside the mound of furs. An old squaw was ordered to bring hot water. Nancy gently removed the soft, doeskin dress of her tiny patient and began rubbing her chest and back with camphor and lard, until it became warm against her hand. A short time later she swiftly mixed a small amount of mustard, flour, and water which she spread on a clean white piece of cloth and applied it to her patient's chest. Chief Many Feathers and Yellow Blossom sat on the opposite side of the fire watching as Nancy rubbed and poulticed Little Star. John and Martha watched also, much too excited to sleep. The remainder of the night seemed hours long. While Nancy waited and worked with her patient, she began thinking of the con- 525 sequences if her efforts to save the chief's daughter should fail. Night finally passed, as did the next day. Nancy spent the time applying poultices, rubbing, and feeding the child hot herb tea. Fear kept her at her post and sleep from her eyes. The chief and his wife never left their side of the blazing fire. Very late the second morning Little Star's dark forehead felt cooler under the gentle touch of Nancy's hand. She was overjoyed, but she did not dare tell Chief Many Feathers and Yellow Blossom so soon. The hours passed; daylight came, and with it the assurance that Little Star would get well. The fever had gone and she slept soundly. After many hours of restful sleep, Little Star awoke. Chief Many Feathers and Yellow Blossom arose and came to her. Taking John and Martha by the hand, Nancy left them alone with their child. Outside the sky was brilliant blue, and the warm sun was high and golden. Climbing up the path, Nancy looked down into the valley from the top of the mountain above the Indian village. Suddenly, she realized that her husband would be home that evening. Taking the children, she hurried back down the path to the chief's wigwam. As she entered, Little Star smiled up at her from her luxurious fur bed. Chief Many Feathers stood before her with Yellow Blossom at his side. Their gratitude was overwhelming. In his efforts to thank her the chief's eyes became unnaturally bright, and (Continued on page 550)
