Carden Making for Centennial Days Hazel D. Moyle HE limelight of the world will I be upon Utah during the year 1947, when we hold our great Centennial celebration. We have all been looking forward eagerly to this date. We have promised ourselves that when it arrived we would have our homes in order, our cities and towns beautified, and our gardens and surroundings made attractive so that we could present ourselves serenely to the world and prove that we have truly made the desert blossom as the rose. The planting around the Latter-day Saint home should receive the critical attention of every homeowner. Brigham Young considered this work of beautification of the greatest importance, even for the earliest log cabins and pioneer farms of our first settlers. President Young's counsel upon this subject is applicable to all of us as we approach the Centennial: Beautify your gardens, your houses, your farms; beautify the city. This will make us happy, and produce plenty. The earth is a good earth, the elements are good if - we will use them for our own benefit, in truth and righteousness. Then let us be content, and go to with our nights to make ourselves healthy, wealthy, and beautiful. And, speaking directly to the women of the Church, this great leader explained his ideals of homemaking in simple and exact terms: It is your right, wives, to ask your husbands to set out beautiful shade and fruit trees, and to get you some vines and flow and if your have not time, get them yourselves and plant them out. Some, perhaps, will say, "Q, I have nothing but a log house, and it is not worth that." Yes, it is worth it. I and get yines to run over the door, so that everybody who passes will say, "What a lovely little cottage!" This is your privilege and I wish you to exercise yourselves in your own rights. These words should spur our modern homeowners into action to make every home lovely with  green lawns and flowers for the coming year. But how are we to accomplish any real planting results in the short time that now remains? One answer to this problem lies in making full, abundant use of the planting season immediately before us, from the middle of August into September and early October. We can start to plant soon after the first of August with excellent results. The days are still hot, but the nights are beginning to grow cooler, with more dewfall. 'The earth is warm and fertile and teeming with vitality. Roots take hold easily in the soil at this time if they are kept moist and are shaded from the sun. Lawn seed planted in early fall germinates quickly and grows rapidly, soon forming a rich carpet of green. The lawn will then have Page 517 518 the entire fall in which to grow, and it will be well established by the time winter arrives and will continue to develop under the snow. When spring comes, the grass will leap into active growth with the first warm day. Perennial plants that are set out in the cold, wet ground of spring take root slowly, and are delayed in their blossoming, but plants that are given the advantage of early fall planting can easily become husky clumps with a full show of bloom the following year. Remember that the success of any planting depends upon four things: thorough preparation of soil; early planting (the earlier the better); shading of the plant from the hot sun while it is taking root and getting ready to grow; and constant. And abundant supply of moisture during the entire fall. And, should freezing weather arrive before the first snowfall, it will be wise to apply a mulch of leaves around the plants to protect them from being heaved out of the ground. Bestir yourself, if you would bring sparkle and color into your garden to help make the Centennial year festive and beautiful. Add such desirables to your garden as the small, low, cushion-like spring perennials that can make the season a thing of beauty. The sweet blue forget-menots for the shady spots; the foamy white arabis to bring a lacy froth along the path; the brilliant and dazzling show put out by that splendid alyssum, basket-of-gold, as many call it; or the equally brilliant and rich-toned purple aubretia, the purple rock cress. Purchase small plants of any of these and give them correct and regular care, and they will nestle down and spread out and prepare to display all their charms next spring, as well as during all the springs to come. These perennials are permanent subjects, well worth the efforts of any home gardener. Among the taller spring bloomers are anchusa myosotifolia, the forget-me-not anchusa, an eighteen-inch, blue-flowered charmer; yellow doronicum, bearing large, pure yellow, daisy-like blooms in great abundance. Doronicum is a splendid shade lover and very useful on this account. Consider columbine, too, in delicate pastel colors, and fragrant sweet rocket, to make a misty lavender haze. With these, and plenty of gay tulips, which will be available this fall, any garden can help to turn next spring into a veritable flower festival. Choose the new kinds of iris for August planting. If these are given plenty of moisture, you will enjoy good iris bloom next season. There are wonderful new kinds of oriental poppies. Find a nurseryman, if you can, who sells the new pink-colored ones. The variety "Wonderkind" is perhaps the finest of all, but many others are of unusual beauty and, once planted, will bloom punctually each year. These flowers demand early planting. Delphinium does best when moved while in active growth. Delphinium often rots if it is set out when the ground is cold and wet. However, this plant is worth all the care it requires, for there is no lovelier decoration for the late June and July garden. Our greatest concern, at present, Se Courtesy Jackson and Perkins Company Newark, New York should be for the flowers that bloom during the July Covered Wagon Days of the Centennial year. This will be the month when visitors Irom far and near will flock to every part of our State. Let us prepare well for this event by giving full space to midsummer bloomers. PHLOX, "PROGRESS" Courtesy Jackson and Perkins Company, Newark New York DELPHINIUM HYBRID, "GAYETY" This delphinium has the all-out-at-once characteristic of bloom, and the spike re-mains in fine condition for considerable time after the top buds have opened. Al-though the side shoots do not crowd the main spike, they come into bloom and continue the period of bloom for several weeks more. The growth is bushy and the blossoming is repeated in the fall. The color is a pink lavender, with an outer row of blue petals, which is very attractive. HOLLYHOCKS display their frilly show during July. Let them stand guard at the gate or by the fence. Shasta daisies make a sea of glistening white. Plant them in generous clumps. Most important of all perennials is the tall midsummer phlox which does well in almost every garden in the intermountain country. Set out generous plantings of this magnificent flower to glorify your July Centennial garden. Nurserymen can supply you with many excellent kinds in a wide range of vivid colors, from pure white through lovely pinks into rosy shades: cherry, salmon, mauve, lavender, scarlet, and purple. You can make a garden of color and perfume worthy of a great occasion with this fine flower alone. Small clumps of phlox can be moved while in full bloom, if they are well watered before being dug, and if they are kept well soaked after moving. They will continue to bloom if they are planted in their new location at once. After blooming, the clumps will continue to develop so that by next year they will produce large masses of showy bloom. Select yours this year if you can. Many of them can be found still blooming, for their flowering .. season is a long one. Phlox plants require a well-enriched soil and prefer a spot receiving a little afternoon shade. They also appreciate additional mulches of manure placed directly over the  stems in fall and before the flowering season. If the garden is hot and phlox will need additional mulching to keep the surface from drying out. Lawn clippings or peat moss are excellent for this purpose. produce large masses of showy can. They need deep and regular soakings during the flowering season. Such attentions bring good returns in large heads of flowers and rich, deep colorings. Utah can blaze with color next midsummer, with iris, phlox, delphiniums, and other hardy perennials. In addition, we can have the bloom of many colorful annuals that can be planted next spring. There is 521 no need for any home to remain shabby or unadorned during the Centennial year, if work is begun at once. Let us put forth our best efforts so that the stranger within our gates will carry away sweet, flowery memories of our Utah homes. Let our well-kept, and flower - adorned homes speak the friendly message of peace and beauty. Many of them can be found Phlox plants require a well-en-moss are excellent for this purpose.
