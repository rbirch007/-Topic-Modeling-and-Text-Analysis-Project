Jessie Miller Robinson In reverie, today, I met her  A creature fairylike with joy, I wondered how I could forget her, Allow the long years to destroy Our star-paved dreams, and love to cloy. Always with trust she met the morrow; Her thoughts were buds of purity, And brief as rain in spring, her sorrow: In faith she prayed, believing God Was good.... The child I used to be. THIS SILENT BARD Evelyn Fjelsted A rose, an affirmation of Life's wondrous beauty and reward, We hear its floral sermon, Pay tribute to this silent bard. A miracle that tells of love, In language understood by all, Whose influence benign, so like A benediction seems to fall. A mystery, this vision fair, Could it have strayed from worlds unseen, To be a guest in gardens here, A stranger on this mundane scene? And whence and how it came, who knows? A rose diffusing perfume rare, Whose silent glory testifies That God is here and everywhere.
