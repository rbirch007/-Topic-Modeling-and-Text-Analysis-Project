The Relief Society Developed Elder H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, December 3, 1946 Objective: growth and joy of women in service. THE administration of the restored Church of Christ as it now is organized upon the earth comes under the order of the Priesthood. 'This means that God himself is at the helm, that the various offices of his order were created by his will and at his express command, and, that in those who lead in his work there must be an understanding of the meaning of true humility, or the Lord cannot fully bestow his blessings. In other words, "not my will, but thine, be done," must be the devout wish of those who would serve him. It may be a long and weary road men travel before they truly come to the full realization of this perfect order of living, and by the time that many have done so, they are ready to pass on into another life, leaving the world once again to a new generation which must for itself learn, through trial and error, the Lord's way to better living. To help his wayward children, in part at least, to understand the blessings of To trace the steps which developed an organization to provide for the brotherly kindness which lead to the kingdom, God instituted the establishment among men of our constitutional government (Doc. And Cov. 101:77-80). The Constitution and Bill of Rights guarantee justice for all. But men, not mindful of the will of God in their lives, often forget the good, and, if called into public office, seek only to promote personal advancement or the interests of special groups. A constitution with bylaws, while one of the best instruments devised by which the common man may be assured his rights, is yet short of the perfect order for the more abundant life. For the perfect brotherhood of man, there needs to be a complete understanding of the fatherhood of God. When men learn that the Lord's way is the best way, then they will accept those he calls to preside over his people and regard their words of counsel as his own. Such an order literally brings upon the earth the kingdom since those Page 631 632 leading have a direct channel to the source of all wisdom, and power and vision to lead the Church aright. In the rich, but trying days, of "Nauvoo the Beautiful," the long: felt desire of the women of the Church to organize their efforts in service found fulfillment. The ex: acting work of manual labor on the part of the men of the Church could not have been borne for so long a period had not the women been ever at hand to provide the physical and spiritual comforts. During the building of the Kirtland Temple, it will be remembered, the sisters were ever on hand. The wife of Hiram Kimball, Sarah M. Kimball, tells of how the sisters of the Church would cheerfully chum butter and bring it to the workmen even to the point of denying their own tables. The spirit of co-operative industry was ever a part of the restored Church. Men and women put the cause of Zion above self. This, naturally, created a desire among them to organize. It is a most significant fact that, as a result of such a desire, the Relief Society came into being, not so much from the standpoint of its being organized, but rather by the way in which the Prophet of the Lord turned that desire into the more perfect pattern of organization under the Priesthood. Note how it was done as related in an account by Sarah M. Kimball: In the spring of 1842, a maiden lady (Miss Cook) was seamstress for me, and the subject of combining our efforts for assisting the temple hands came up in conversation. She desired to be helpful, but had no means to furnish. I told her I would furnish material if she would make some shirts for the workmen. It was then suggested that some of the neighbors might wish to combine means and efforts with ours, and we decided to invite a few to come and consult with us on the subject of forming a Ladies' Society. The neighboring sisters met in my parlor and decided to organize. I was delegated to call on Sister Eliza R. Snow and ask her to write for us a constitution and bylaws and submit them to President Joseph Smith prior to our next Thursday's meeting. She cheerfully responded, and when she read them to him he replied that the constitution and bylaws were the best he had ever seen. "But," he said, "this is not what you want. Tell the sisters their offering is accepted of the Lord, and He has something better for them than a written constitution. Invite them all to meet me and a few of the brethren in the Masonic Hall over my store next Thursday afternoon, and I will organize the sisters under the Priesthood after a pattern of the Priesthood." He further said, "This Church was never perfectly organized until the women were thus organized" (VI, March 1919, page 129). The Lord had something better for them than a written constitution. How significant and most fittingly true have become the Prophet's words. A society founded upon 4 constitutional order would have, by nature, its roots in the customs of men. Officers to lead such a society would tend to look more to the legally granted rights of their calling than to the calling itself. But the Lord, through his Prophet, chose to outline a better way of turning to account the desires of his handmaidens. 'They, in part at least, were to function under the. Administrative order of the Priesthood even though they could not be given the Priesthood itself. Accordingly, 'on Thursday afternoon, March 17, 1842, as the day agreed upon, eighteen attentive LESSON DEPARTMENT women met the Prophet Joseph Smith in company with Elders John Taylor and Willard Richards. The Prophet called Elder Taylor to the chair and appointed Elder Willard Richards to act as secretary. "The Spirit of God Like a Fire Is Burning" was sung, and Elder Taylor opened the meeting with prayer. The Prophet then began to organize the women present, who were: Emma H. Smith Sarah M. Cleveland Phebe Ann Hawkes Elizabeth Jones Sophia Packard Philinda Merrick Martha Knight Desdemona Fulmer Elizabeth Ann Whitney Bathsheba W. Smith Phebe M. Wheeler Elvira A. Coles Margaret A. Cook Sarah M. Kimball Eliza R. Snow Sophia Robinson Leonora Taylor Sophia R. Marks In addition to the eighteen women present, the following women, not present, were also admitted to membership at this first meeting: Sarah Higbee Thirza Cahoon Keziah A. Morrison Marinda N. Hyde Abigail Allred Mary Snider Lydia D. Granger Cynthia A. Eldredge President Joseph Smith addressed the sisters: " _ _ to illustrate the object of the Society that the Society of the sisters might provoke the brethren to good works in looking to the wants of the poor, searching after objects of charity and in administering to their wants to assist by correcting the morals and strengthening the virtues of the community, and save the elders the trouble of rebuking; that they may give their time to other duties, 633 etc., in their public teaching" (Relief Society Minutes, March 17, 1842). President Smith further remarked: ?that an organization to show them how to work was sufficient, or how to go to work was sufficient. He proposed that the sisters elect a presiding officer to preside over them, and let the presiding officer choose two counselors to assist in the duties of her office... And if they need his instruction, ask him, he will give it from time to time.... Let this presidency serve as a Constitution all their decisions be considered law, and acted upon as such. If any officers are wanted to carry out the design of the institution let them be appointed and set apart... - The minutes of your meetings ill be precedent for you to act upon your Constitution and law" (A Century of Relief Society, page 15)- "Let this presidency serve as a Constitution all their decisions be considered law, and acted upon as such." To one not knowing the workings of the Priesthood, such a plan of organization might seem dictatorial. In outward form perhaps, yes, but in inward spirit, far from such. To one who understands the gospel call to authority, comes the knowledge that such falls under the words of the Master, "Ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you." In other words, the call to true leadership can come only to one who is worthy in every way to completely forget self in service to fellow man. "He that is greatest among you shall be your servant" (Matt. 23:11). If this principle is thoroughly understood by all Church members, then officer and layman, alike, willingly unite for the sake of the cause, since the cause is greater by far than anyone in it, great or small. By instructing the sisters to counsel together under their presidency, and by directing that presidency to look to the head of the Church for final counsel, the Prophet established for the Relief Society the pattern of government that could lay claim on direct inspiration from the Lord himself. Think how such an organization so conceived and so dedicated can serve! To all its members, there can come the assurance that all services given will go directly to the relief of want and suffering. To the officers of such a society, there can come the peace of mind known only to those who have taken upon them his yoke and learned that his burden is light. Why? Because they have the joy of service that comes because the call came rather than was sought. Today, after more than a century, the golden symbol of the Relief Society circles the hearts of more than a hundred thousand souls. 'The good bread of life and the touch of learning are therein shown, and the phrase "Charity never faileth," forever becomes the watchword of service. Women who belong have found its eternal meaning. Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion: With the help of the suggested readings given below, have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part of the text to discover wherein we must "give heed unto his word." 1. On March 20, 1839, just about three years to the day before the organization of the Relief Society, the Prophet Joseph Smith was a prisoner in the Liberty Jail. He gave us at that time one of the most beautiful prophecies on the Priesthood of God and its functioning that has ever been written. In part, he said, "That the rights of the Priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven" (Doc. And Cov. 121:36). Just what does this mean? Give each member of your class a few minutes time to write down her answer. Then have each respond. After the response, have all of the 1215s section of the Doctrine and Covenants read without interruption. At the conclusion of the reading, make especially the verses 33 to 46 the subject of class discussion. 2. If you were asked to name just one joy of service the Relief Society has offered you, what would it be? Get a response from all class members before reading to them the following words, addressed by the Prophet Joseph at the sixth meeting of the Society held at Nauvoo, April 28, 1842: Let this Society teach women how to behave towards their husbands, to treat them with mildness and affection. When a man is borne down with trouble, when he is perplexed with care and difficulty, if he can meet a smile instead of an argument or a murmur if he can meet with mildness, it will calm down his soul and soothe his feelings; when the mind is going to despair, it needs a solace of affection and kindness. You will receive instructions through the order of the Priesthood which God has established, through the medium of those appointed to lead, guide and direct the affairs of the Church in this last dispensation; and I now turn the key in your behalf in the name of the Lord, and this Society shall rejoice, and knowledge and intelligence shall flow down from this time henceforth; this is the beginning of better days to the poor and needy, who shall be made to rejoice and pour forth blessings on your heads (Documentary History of the Church, IV, pp. 606-7). For this lesson, the most significant material for inspiration and reading is A Centenary of Relief Society, published by the General Board of the Relief Society, price so cents. The teacher should bring to the class at least one copy of this excellent presentation of one hundred years of Relief Society.

Lesson 3�Faith
President Amy Brown Lyman
For Tuesday, December 3, 1946
Objective: To show that the pioneers recognized and practiced the first principle of revealed religion, namely faith�faith in God, faith in their leaders, faith in one another, and faith in a great cause.
THAT the pioneers had great and abiding faith in their Heavenly Father, in their leaders, in one another, and in the great gospel cause we constantly demonstrated in their daily lives and in their many co-operative undertakings.
One of the severest tests of their faith came in the winter of 1846 when they were forced to choose between relinquishing their religious beliefs or giving up their homes. And they were not only losing their homes, but also their beautiful city, Nauvoo, and their beloved temple which had been built at such great cost in effort and sacrifice.
As dear to their hearts as were their lovely homes, their sacred temple, and their beloved city, dearer still to them was the gospel of the Master. And with the same indomitable faith and courage as that which had been demonstrated by the saints in Missouri, they chose to cling to their religious convictions and meet whatever hazards and sacrifices this action might involve. They realized fully that leaving their homes at this time did not mean merely trying again to locate in another part of the State or in another of the adjoining states, but that it meant a move, a desperate and daring move, into the great, un-
known, western desert, where, far from their enemies, they hoped to establish a home in which they could worship God in perfect freedom and work out in their own way their social and religious problems.
The migration of the Mormon pioneers�their exodus from Nauvoo, their journey across the plains, and their settlement in the desert, is one of the greatest examples of pioneering in human history. The question always arises, how was it ever accomplished? The answer is that it was accomplished through unflinching faith, accompanied by unceasing struggle and matchless hard work.
First, there was implicit faith and trust in the Lord and in his protecting care. Second, there was faith in their leaders and in the inspiration of those leaders. And finally, there was their faith in the great cause to which they were devoted. It was their conviction that theirs was the true gospel of the Master, which had been restored again, and that they had been called to help to prepare the earth for the coming of Christ. Thus it is seen that religion with its dynamic qualities was the most vital thing in the life of these pioneers, sustaining and steadying them in every adjustment they were called to make. LESSON DEPARTMENT 635  Work Meeting Sewing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting) Lesson 3?Fitting and Adjusting Patterns, and Cutting Work Meeting Committee, Velma N. Simonsen, Chairman For Tuesday, December 10, 1946 Objective: To decide the proper style of pattern and suitable material for a given individual; to teach how to interpret commercial patterns; to demonstrate the adjusting of a pattern to individual measurements, and the cutting. Reference: Patterns and Measurements SATISFACTORY work is based on accurate measurement. To measure is to verify a given length or space in terms of a_ standard gauge. For all types of dressmaking, a good pattern is indispensable. It is not economy to use makeshift patterns at any time. Widths and lengths of the figure are the basic measurements used in patterns. All patterns should be purchased according to bust measurements, with the exception of skirts, slacks, etc., which are usually purchased by hip or waist measurements. It is better to use a tape measure to compare the size of your pattern with your own measurements, rather than to attempt to pin the thin tissue pieces together and try them on; however, in order to thoroughly understand a given pattern, it may be helpful to pin the various parts together before laying them out. A pattern carefully fitted to your measurements, lines, and proportions, should cut a garment which will need little or no The Complete Book of Sewing, Chapters 10 and 11. Fitting. 'The home sewer can eliminate fitting problems by carefully following, step by step, the instructions given on each pattern for making the proper adjustments. Patterns are made to standard measurements, yet seldom is the human figure standard in every detail. Laying on the Pattern To ensure the proper fit of a garment, lay the pattern over the material on a table, being sure that the pieces are laid either straight of the goods or bias, as the pattern indicates. Cutting Be sure that the pattern and the material are pinned securely together, and are lying flat on the table before beginning to cut the garment. Also, recheck carefully with a tape measure, the bust, waist, hip, and length measurements before doing your cutting. Assignment for January: Bring your pattern and cut-out material to class. Also, bring pieces of different types of cloth, such as cotton, wool, silk, rayon, chiffon, etc.; also, a needle, thread, and thimble.
