FALL DAYS ARE CLOSING IN Grace M. Candland The misty canyon's blue is on the land, The stubble fields lie sere and brittle dry; The crickets chant their nightly symphony; Wild geese in wedge formation chart the sky The air is cool and hints of coming frost, A two-point moon glides slowly to the west, A family of birds we used to know Have gone and left their tattered nest. Last night the mountain oak showed signs of age, Today the sumac leaves are lined with red, The junipers now hold an ample store Of gay vermilion berries overhead. There is a touch of sadness in the fall, But let not brooding ever be a part Of all this coloring and quiet charm Now come to soothe, relax, and warm the heart.
