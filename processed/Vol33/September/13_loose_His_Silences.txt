HIS SILENCES Blanche Kendall McKey He wears deep in his eyes an alien look? This changeling who has closed an open door, Yet smiles to touch his desk, his pen, his book, Nor does he fail to cherish as before. A note cries from his voice sometimes at night That halts me, leaves me stranded and alone. What lies unburned, guarded from my sight, To shut him from me by a shaded tone? I did not sleep with pain and halt with death, Nor rise from blows because a dream shone clear, Nor shout above the flames with pulsing breath Because my God had stilled the beat of fear. I may not touch the latchstring of that gate Which holds his silences inviolate! . 1 report for 1 accomplishments of Our more than one Society women 945 reveals the year's hundred thousand Relief Page GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF RELIEF SOCIETY AND MEMBERS Paper December 31, 1965 Membership 
Membership
THE aim of the General Board is to enroll as a Relief Society member every eligible Latter-day Saint woman. It is presumed that there is at least one woman eligible for Relief Society membership in each family in the Church. There are 61,665 Latter-day Saint families in the stakes not represented in Relief Society, while in the missions each family is represented by 1.8 members.
During the year, the missions gained 138 members and the stakes lost 509 members, making a net membership decrease of 371 or .36%. The membership loss is attributed principally to changing the time of Relief Society meeting, in some localities, from Sunday (a wartime expedient) to a weekday, to losses through death, resignation, removal, and to post-war population shifts.
In order to provide development for its members and to accomplish the objectives of the Relief Society program, a majority of the members are assigned to positions of responsibility. The variety of opportunity afforded for this development is indicated in the accompanying chart which shows the membership distribution in positions of leadership.

WARD and branch Relief Society meetings of all types held during 1945 numbered 84,477, an increase of 3,622 or 447% over the previous year.
There was a marked increase of 2,323 in the number of regular weekly meetings and an increase of 388 in visiting teacher training report meetings held over the year 1944. However, there was a decrease of 83 in the number of ward preparation meetings, a decrease of 271 ward conferences and a decrease of 59 in officers' meetings held in connection with ward conferences so that the net increase in the total number of meetings of all types was 3,622. This included 1315 March Sunday meetings, now not called for in the 1944 annual report.
The average attendance at visiting teacher training meetings was 3,175 or 9.87%, even though the number of such meetings increased.
While membership in the Society showed a slight decrease, this was offset by an increase in attendance at the regular meetings, indicating greater activity and interest on the part of the membership. The stakes showed an increase in average attendance at regular meetings of 1.09% over 1944, while the missions showed an even higher increase of 5.26%.

Visiting Teaching SERVICE
THIS service was inaugurated in 1843, just a year after the Society was organized. In addition to carrying greetings of cheer and comfort and faith-sustaining messages from the Society to Latter-day Saint families, visiting teachers report confidentially to the local president any cases of need they may observe on their visits, and perform any compassionate service requested of them by the Relief Society president.
Messages planned for discussion in the homes, begun in 1916, have ranged from subjects of practical interest to the homemaker to those of deep spiritual import. The "Beatitudes" and "Charity" were the subjects of messages carried by visiting teachers into Latter-day Saint homes through the 1945 period. Out of more than one million visits made, 68.1% of the families called upon were found at home, a slightly better ratio than was found at home during the previous year's visits. Visits made where no one was found at home constituted 31.9% of the total visits. Of the families found at home messages were delivered to 63.6% of them.
Each Latter-day Saint home should be visited once a month, or twelve times annually, in accordance with the Relief Society visiting teaching program. During 1945, there was an average of 7.2 visits made to each family, a slight increase over 1944 when an average of 7.1 visits was made to each family.
An increase of 4602 communications made by mail or telephone in lieu of visits was reported. These communications will, no doubt, be reduced to a minimum, as personal visits to the homes are resumed now that travel facilities are available.

Educational SERVICE
FOR more than one hundred years the Society has carried forward its work of education. The program has been adapted to the needs of women over a period of time extending from a rigorous pioneering era to one of great social and industrial advancement, and it has aided the women of each period to better adjust to conditions. It has contributed to the personal development of Relief Society members, has widened their sphere of influence, and qualified them to better serve their fellow men.

During the past year, 7,335 class leaders conducted courses. Interest in theology, literature, and social science courses increased as evidenced in the average attendance, but interest in work meetings did not keep pace, due, probably, to scarcity of sewing materials. There was a decrease of 270 women in average attendance at each work meeting. Note from the chart that the greatest interest is in the theology course which, for many years, has held first place in the hearts of members. During 1945, an average of 1,064 more women attended the monthly theology meeting than in 1944.
Social science held second place, showing the greatest increase in interest of any of the courses, and an average of 1071 more women at each meeting.
Literature continued in third place with an average of 347 more women participating at each meeting.
Through these courses, an average of 29,697 women each week, or 18.78% of Latter-day Saint families received the benefit of the educational program.
In addition to regular courses of study, Relief Society members are encouraged to enroll in classes sponsored by the American Red Cross with a view to increasing their knowledge of subjects designed to promote health and well-being. The Red Cross, in 1945, certified 806 Relief Society members in these classes.

Compassionate SERVICE
"Said Jesus, 'ye shall do the work which ye see me do.' These are the grand keywords for the Society to act upon." �Prophet Joseph Smith
AT the ninth meeting of the Relief Society, in 1842, the following important instruction was given the Society by the Prophet: "Said Jesus, 'Ye shall do the work which ye see me do.' These are the grand keywords for the Society to act upon."
And the Society has acted upon these words from that day to the present time. During the war years, there has been pronounced need for compassionate services. This type of service has enlisted the time and abilities of tens of thousands of our members, both at home and abroad. It should be remembered that many deeds of kindness, compassion, and helpfulness performed for those in distress which cannot be measured in terms of reports. In these stressful times the Relief Society encourages an even greater spirit of sympathetic service among its members in support of the Prophet Joseph's admonition: "If you would have God have mercy on you�have mercy on one another . . . The best measure or principle to bring the poor to repentance is to administer to their wants." The Society is not only to relieve the poor, but to save souls."
In 1945, there were 118,730 visits made to the sick and homebound, an increase of 2511 or 2.16%, but the number of days' care of the sick declined from 13,883 to 12,946 or 6.74%.
118,730 VISITS TO THE SICK HOMEBOUND 12,946 DAYS CARE OF THE SICK
A total of 594 bodies were prepared for burial during 1945. Of this number, 411 involved dressing only, while 183 bodies were completely prepared for burial by Relief Society. There were 74 fewer bodies dressed for burial during 1945, and 29 fewer completely prepared for burial. These figures represent a decrease of 10.5 or 14.77% in the number of bodies prepared for burial, both in complete preparation and dressing only, which indicates an increase in the services of morticians.
The Relief Society assisted at 4408 funerals, an increase of 341 or 8.38% over 1944. The assistance of Relief Society members at funerals has become traditional and, apparently, is one of the most widely used and deeply appreciated services rendered by the organization. In addition, Relief Society members as individuals perform countless comforting and helpful acts of which no record is made.

Sewing SERVICE
SEWING for the needy was one of the original purposes for which Relief Society was organized, and it continues today of primary importance. This activity not only helps to provide for the needy, but it also offers a channel for practical training for both the experienced and inexperienced sewer.
Church Welfare sewing is the most important part of the regular work-meeting program, followed by Relief Society quilting and sewing projects. In addition to practical sewing for the needy and for their own families, Relief Society women are increasing rare and beautiful handcraft skills through the work meeting.
Regular interest in aiding the needy is Churchwide, we are showing here a chart depicting war-service figures and Relief Society articles completed. Note that the call for men's, women's, and children's clothing is high, as was the case in 1944.
The average number of women doing sewing work and month decreased 270 during 1945 from 1944. Less than one-fourth of the total membership of the Society participated in the sewing program. The goal of the Relief Society is to have every member experience the joy and satisfaction found in sewing activities.
Approximately one-fourth of the women sewing at Relief Society work meeting during 1945 sewed articles for the American Red Cross. Although more hours of service were given during 1945 than in 1944, the articles completed were only two-thirds of the number reported in 1944.

Church Welfare SERVICE
THE Relief Society provides service for the Church Welfare Plan by sewing, canning, and doing other types of food processing, by harvesting, and by giving employment service. The value of this contribution is incalculable. During 1945, Relief Society members gave 191,053 hours of service to Church Welfare projects. Work is done in Relief Society meetings.
The number of articles completed for the Church Welfare Plan totaled 42,527, a decrease of 49,855 from 1944. This decrease is due, almost wholly, to the scarcity of materials which prohibited some Societies from filling their sewing budget requirements. (There is no segregated report of the amount of time spent at Relief Society meetings on Church Welfare sewing.)
During the month of December 1945, the Society, in support of the Church Welfare Plan, participated in an extensive relief program for the aid of destitute Latter-day Saint families in the war-stricken countries of Europe. This included the contribution by Relief Society of 5944 quilts and 1403 blankets; contribution of 47,173 bars of soap by Relief Society members, and participation in the collection, sorting, mending, and packing of great quantities of good used clothing. While the ward bishoprics supply the material needs of families under their care, the Relief Society is fully cooperating with them in analyzing, under their direction, the situation of families in need. This past year, 9508 persons in 3231 families were given such service by the Relief Society. This service was in addition to the other types of service given by Relief Society to the Church Welfare Plan.
