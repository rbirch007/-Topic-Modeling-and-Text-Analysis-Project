Clarence Edwin Flynn None knows how lovely is the door That in the evening swings. Until it welcomes him no more From daily journeyings. None knows how lovely is a gate That opens easily, Till unresponsive hinges wait In silence, drearily. None knows how lovely are the hands That touch him in the gloam. The voice of love that understands, Till he must stand alone. Give thanks, and make each hour that goes, A golden memory; So steadily the river flows On to the silent sea. Pioneer Stories and Incidents THE INDIANS AND THE MAIL ROUTE President Amy Brown Lyman (This is the third in a series of true pioneer incidents to be published by Thein honor of the 1947 Utah Centennial celebration.�Ed.] N interesting incident, with a dramatic sequence, which happened away back in 1862 in the life of her pioneer husband, was often related by Sister Elizabeth Caine Crismon, who, for ten years, was a member of the General Board of Relief Society. Charles Crismon, Jr., her husband, crossed the plains with his parents in 1847, when he was but three years old. He grew up with the new country, going through the varied trials and experiences of the western pathfinder. As a young man, he was ambitious, energetic, and a willing worker, undertaking and carrying through successfully many difficult and dangerous tasks. In his early teens he drove a herd of sheep across the plains from the Missouri River to Salt Lake City. With his father and brother, George, he was active in the development of the resources of both Utah and the San Bernardino district of California. They, later, fostered many pioneer projects and became successful businessmen and industrialists. Charles Crismon, Jr., was also brave, public-spirited, _ patriotic, and ever ready to serve his country in time of need. This was demonstrated when, at the age of eighteen, he volunteered his services to the Government to help protect the western mail route from the Indians, who seemed bent on destroying Page 594 not only the stations, but also those who operated them. In the skirmishes connected therewith, a number of men, women, and children lost their lives. It was in the spring of 1862 that President Lincoln called for volunteers from Utah to carry on this hazardous undertaking, and young Crismon readily enlisted for the service, leaving Salt Lake on short notice for headquarters at Chimney Rock, Wyoming. He was a member of the company of Lot Smith, that brave and courageous leader and frontiersman, who, thirty years later, lost his life at the hands of Navajo Indians in Arizona, while helping to defend a Latter-day Saint colony there. Many years after, late in his life, Brother Crismon, who was in frail health, made frequent visits to California. One summer day during one of these visits, while he and Sister Crismon were resting in the sunshine in Golden Gate Park, they made the acquaintance of a very interesting and congenial woman who sat in a chair near them and engaged them in conversation, 'They soon found that they had much in common, all being western pioneers. Brother Crismon, in a reminiscent mood, related some of his early-day experiences, and among them he recalled the following story connected with the mail route expedition. PIONEER STORIES AND INCIDENTS He told that on one occasion, when members of Lot Smith's company were approaching a certain mail station which they feared was in danger, they discovered that the station had already been attacked by the Indians and was all ablaze. As they neared the spot, the Indians fled and the soldiers noticed that a little child was being carried away by them. The soldiers hurried on, and, although they were not successful in rescuing this unfortunate little one, they put forth desperate efforts to do so. They discovered that the agent and his wife, the parents of the child, and her half-grown 595 brother had not only been scalped by the Indians, but their lives had been taken. Throughout the narration of this incident by Brother Crismon, the new-found friend listened with great intensity to every detail of the story, and, at the end, showed unmistakable signs of emotion, as she exclaimed, "And I was that very child!" Then she added, "I was held by the Indians for several years, until some of my relatives who had searched diligently for me, obtained clues, and then succeeded in rescuing me."
