song in which the Indians joined freely. Every missionary tried to learn the Shoshone language. Some three or four tried to learn the language by marrying into the tribe. Curiously, this was frowned upon by the parents of the girls, for it is reported they were "not willing.' 'These marriages must not have been successful for, when the settlers returned to Salt Lake Valley, only one Indian wife elected to go along. In May 1857, Brigham Young, with several apostles and a goodly company of friends and relatives of the settlers, visited the colony. Some of the visiting brethren were highly enthusiastic about the country, but it is recorded that Brigham Young Peon � Idaho State Historic 587 expressed his doubts about the wisdom of their having gone so far north. The fort was situated 375 miles northward from Salt Lake City and, with the prevailing modes of transportation, that was a long way. And the settlers were entirely surrounded by Indians. They were advised to build another enclosure, this time for their stock. Until this visit, the farming had been done on a community basis, but afterward, some surveying was done and individual farms laid out. Another fort was built. John E. Reese says it was built of rocks and mud that hardened into "some kind of cement." As a protection from the Indians, the walls were not worth much, for the red men could crouch on the hillside and shoot down into the enclosure. The cabins were much better, for their thick log walls were impervious to bullets and arrows. LEMHI VALLEY, IDAHO Note the log fence and the tall "stock" gate. After returning to Salt Lake, President Young sent north another company of men, which swelled the population of the fort to about one hundred. Several women went with the last company. By the fall of 1857, the colony was in a thriving condition. The crops had been good. Several hundred Indians had been baptized, and pleasant contacts had been made with hunting and exploring parties passing through the valley. There seemed every reason to believe the colonists were there to stay. Chief Snagg and his band of Shoshones often ate and slept at the fort. But, while outwardly peace lay like a blanket over the project, there were various mutterings and stirrings that bulged the blanket here and there, all of which resulted in an open attack against the settlement the morning of February 25, 1858, by a band of Shoshones and Bannocks. The colonists had been warned that an attack was imminent, but as they had little faith in their informer, no preparations for defense had been made. Two men, George McBride and James Miller, were killed; several men were wounded; and most of the cattle were driven away.

Reese; R. B. Herndon; Judge Shurtliff fighting, the missionaries were called to a meeting to determine their course. As a result, two men, B. H. Watts and E. J. Bernard, were sent for help. All this happened at a time when the threat of Johnston's Army lay like a blight against the security of the saints. President Young decided to recall all Mormons living beyond the bounds of Utah Territory. He sent north a company of 150 men to the rescue of the Salmon mission. The men reached the fort, March 21, 1858. The settlers had already made preparations for their return to Utah. It is said that Chief Snagg and his men wept tears when they saw the company leave. The company reached Brigham City April 11, and there disbanded. Thus came to an end the Fort Lemhi attempt to colonize Idaho, but many of the colonists later came back and helped develop other communities.
