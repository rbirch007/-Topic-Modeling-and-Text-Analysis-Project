A Message to Teachers Dr. M. Lynn Bennion Superintendent, Salt Lake City Schools ANY suggestions have been made for improving the quality of teaching in the auxiliary organizations of the Church. A great deal of emphasis has been placed, in recent years, on better teaching methods, but better methods, alone, will not result in effective teaching. Good teachers often succeed with old-fashioned methods, and poor teachers fail to get results with the best methods. Something in addition to better methods is needed. Teachers must be imaginative and have a clear understanding of the purpose underlying their work. What they need, above all, is a sense of challenge, of moral compulsion, as a group who have a mission to perform. 'Teachers who feel this challenge create a zest for learning among their students and thus become superior teachers. Teachers must find their motivation, essentially, from the light within. Each of us, however, can do much to fan the flame. We can make the teachers feel that their work is important�that their ideas count. We can give them the confidence and freedom necessary to do their best work. We can do much to give the teachers the prestige they deserve. Relief Society teachers have already won great prestige in and out of the Church because of what they have stood for.

They have included the major issues troubling our communities. Let us now ask ourselves the question: How may we improve Relief Society teaching�how make it meet more adequately the needs and demands of our atomic age? The rapid transitions that are taking place in society demand great leadership. Much is at stake. Civilization, as we know it, is actually in the balance. The terrifying task of winning the peace is not only the task of winning back the ground lost through war, but of reaching a new moral summit adequate for the demands of a new day. It will take a spiritual earnestness and conviction manyfold more intense than all our efforts to win the war. It might be likened to the attempt of Pandora to gather into her casket again, the released human ills, for out of the welter of misunderstandings and hates, of wrongs and crime, the world must be brought to a state of mutual
