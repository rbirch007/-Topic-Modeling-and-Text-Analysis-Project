PARADE Grace M. Candland The summer has passed; its quiet parade Of budding. And bloom and its cooling shade Are only a dream, a faded brocade. What joy I have missed I scarcely can guess, The flight of the hours and ceaseless stress 'Have blinded my eyes to earth's loveliness. I am quite sure I neglected to go Down to the creek where the wild roses grow, Or look at the fruit-laden trees below. But autumn is here, its colors outspread, My hunger for beauty is amply fed, And I shall enjoy this glory instead.
