Sallie-Start-Something Alice Whitson Norton 66 OW, Sallie," warned Mother her Tidwell, when Sallie started out to meet the youngsters living in the new location to which they had just moved, "remember your promise." "Yes, Mother," answered the girl, "T will remember." "I wonder," mused the mother, as her daughter went tripping down the path leading to the gate, "if she will." Back in the old community where Sallie had lived, she had made a reputation for herself of starting things and never finishing them, until some of the girls in the neighborhood had given her the name of Sallie-Start Something, and the name had stayed. Even at that, nobody ever made a complaint about Sallie, for she was one of those pleasant creatures whom people willingly serve, and when she started anything (she was generally back of any new movement undertaken in the community), some of the other girls would be ready to carry the idea through. But before Sallie left the old community, she had had a heart-to-heart talk with her mother, and they had agreed that Sallie was going to leave the old name and reputation behind when they moved away. So, before Sallie began taking an active interest in her new neighbors, Mother Tidwell felt reasonably sure that she would abide by her promise; but, when Sallie began running out to meet the girls, Mother Tidwell began to feel uneasy. Then, one afternoon, in came Sallie, her face flushed and her eyes sparkling. "Mother," she exclaimed, "what do you think this community of girls has no reading center!" For a moment Mrs. Tidwell stood regarding her daughter with a look of mingled surprise and _ pleasure. Sallie had started something, she knew, without so much as questioning her. "When does the first meeting take place, Sallie?" the mother asked pleasantly. "Why, Mother," exclaimed the girl in a tone of amazement, "how did you know we were going to organize a reading society?" "That is something I cannot answer," laughed the mother, "but it�s a fact, isn�t it?" "Yes'm," answered Sallie, "I?I ?well, when I found out the state of things I just couldn't resist inviting the girls over to our house for an hour of reading. You see," went on Sallie, enthusiastically, "these girls need to start their mental powers to work, and by forming a good reading club, I figured that I would be helping them without their knowing it." "Quite true, my dear," replied the mother, "but, remember, you haven't the old crowd back of you now to finish what you start, and, unless you have made up your mind to stick to the finish, I Page 683 684 most earnestly beseech you to call it off right now. I don't want you to make the same sort of reputation here as you left in the old town. Sallie-Start-Something isn't a very high-sounding name for a girl in her teens." "Sallie-Start-Something," repeated the girl slowly. Then, suddenly, her face lighted up with inspiration. "Why, Mother," she said happily, "that phrase wouldn't be such a bad trade-mark, provided the something started was a worthy venture and continued to live, would it?" "No," admitted the mother with a fearful heart, "if the something started was started in good faith and carried out, it could mean a lot to a new neighborhood, but think it over, my dear, and think seriously before you start anything." "Yes'm," answered Sallie, as she started for the door leading to her own small room above, "I�ll think it over seriously." Some two hours later Sallie came down, dressed in her best red wool dress and matching beret. "You've been thinking, Sallie," asked the mother, "of what we were talking about?" "I have," replied the girl, "and I've made up my mind that it's not my ideas, but my methods that are bad." "Then you will give up the reading society?" questioned the mother. "Give up something I've just started?" exclaimed Sallie, "No, indeed, Mother. Here's where Sallie Start-Something begins to change her policies. From now on, Sallie Start-Something will start more things than she has ever started be fore, and back up her starting by sticking to them." So it happened that Sallie-Start Something from the old town, be came Sallie-Stick-To-It in the new, and, under her capable directorship, not only a reading society, but various other organizations were started and held together for the good of the community. And even to this day, though Sallie is no longer a teen-age girl, the community de pends on her to start something when it begins to lag in interesting events. And no longer does the mother worry about her daughter's reputation ? Sallie-Start-Something-and-Stick-To-It means quite a different thing from the Sallie-Start-Something of the old town. The beloved Sallie will tell you herself, that while the world is full of the former type of young women, the Sallie-Start-Something kind who leaves the venture in somebody else's hands to finish, there are also a few of the Sallie-Start-Somcthing-and-Stick-To It kind, and those, after all, are the ones who keep the old world running smoothly.  FAT SALVAGE CAMPAIGN The need for saving fats and oils is still acute. Housewives are urged to bring salvaged fats and oils to meat markets, retail grocery stores, and packing plants. The materials thus salvaged can be used for making soap, nylons, shoes, paints, printing ink, fabrics, cellophane, electrical appliances, linoleum, and hundreds of other products. The American Fat Salvage Committee gives this timely advice: "American women can help themselves get more soap, and help the famine areas of the world get more food fats and oils simply by conserving all fats and oils and turning every drop of used cooking fat over to the meat dealer for four cents a pound."
