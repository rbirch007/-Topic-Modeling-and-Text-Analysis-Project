CROCHETING Dorothy J. Roberts Beauty flows from her finger tips, The twinkling needle, the tinted yarn, Delicate as a baby's lips. The woman is young OF she is old, Her home small or elaborate, The day is warm OF the season cold. All or any, she only knows Ecstasy as her fingers fly, Fulfillment as the pattern grows.
