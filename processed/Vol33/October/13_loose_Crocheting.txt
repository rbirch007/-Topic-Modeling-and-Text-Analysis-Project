CROCHETING Dorothy J. Roberts Beauty flows from her finger tips, The twinkling needle, the tinted yarn, Delicate as a baby's lips. The woman is young OF she is old, Her home small or elaborate, The day is warm OF the season cold. All or any, she only knows Ecstasy as her fingers fly, Fulfillment as the pattern grows. UE} DEPARTMENT Theology Church History Lesson 20 The Educational System Developed Elder H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, January 7, 1947 Objective: J(NOWLEDGE of truth brings: freedom. The Master throughout the days of his mortal existence strove ever to teach men this underlying principle of life. He knew that men could not be free to think, free to act, and free to live unless they also were free in agency to seek after truth. So important is free agency for men that God is ever willing to hazard the difficulties which always attend its continuance upon the earth. To relate this thought to the rise and development of the educational system of the restored Church, let us once again think of the opening vision that brought the light from heaven in our-day. "If any of you lack wisdom" (James 1:5) read the young Prophet. In this world men will always lack wisdom and will thirst for its acquirement. The significant thing about Joseph Smith's lack of knowledge is to be found not so much in his limited opportunities to know, as it is in his discovery of the channel through which all great truth comes, namely, the asking of God. It is this fact that looms high above all others if one would explain the astonishing de Page 696 To show that God would have his children seek after all that is good. development of the educational system among the Latter-day Saints. From the organization of the Church, on April 6, 1830, to the present day, the way to better living for the Latter-day Saint people has been illuminated intelligent search for all things of worth, to be found "above the earth, in the earth and below the earth." "The glory of God is intelligence." "It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance," revealed the modern Prophet, (Doc. And Cov. 93:36 and 131:6). What a spur these thoughts have been to modern Israel! They stir the imagination to purposeful acts and give new meaning to the utterance of the Savior, "And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free" (John 8:32). With the knowledge of the new but eternal way of laying claim to the fountain head of all wisdom, young missionaries of the newly restored Church went forth. Most of. These young men were unlettered in the scholastic sense in which one would point to an educated man today. Yet the lack of formal schooling did not dampen their spirits. They felt that as their Prophet and LESSON DEPARTMENT leader might go directly to the Lord for help, they too, might seek his counsel. As the Church membership increased, and as the desire to know more of God's revealed word grew, Joseph Smith sought to bring his elders together in groups to instruct them. It is significant that he founded "The School of the Prophets," and chose for the place of its meeting the top floor of the Kirtland Temple. So inspirational were the classes held in the sacred building that practical men, like Brigham Young, who attended, never forgot the need for educational training in the cause of Zion. The search for truth, it was taught, should be constant and always enjoined by prayer. In one of the revelations given through the Prophet, at Kirtland, we read the following: Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand; of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home; things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms. That ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send you again to magnify the calling whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I have commissioned you (Doc. And Cov. 88:78-80). With such words from the Lord, there can be no limit to the search for knowledge. All that is good and true in the learning of men, God would have his children know; and 697. Has promised that his grace would attend their teaching and study. Such an inspirational call for leadership in learning left the practical builders of Zion a clear assignment for the erection of schools and academies of higher education. Latter-day Saints would accept all that was good in secular training and then add to such the blessings of the spirit which come through a study of his word. Latter-day Saint schools have always provided instruction for the physical, as well as the spiritual nature of man. The college song of the leading Church institution of higher learning, Brigham Young University, includes this phrase, "The head, the heart, the hand united must be true." How fittingly significant these words suggest the basic philosophy of Latter-day Saints' teaching. Let us consider the "head." From the earliest beginning of education the teacher's calling has been to train the mind, to provide lessons that would provoke clear thinking, and arrange fitting exercises for the development of logic. The love of scholarship often overshadowed the teaching of physical fitness. The "heart" truly inspirational teaching has as its central objective the training of the emotions. These spring from the heart and find their fountain source in the gospel. All true wisdom and understanding must come from God and so, in the best of learning situations, there must be that true instruction of him who knoweth all things. One cannot graduate from a Church school without training in the emotions of the heart. ' The "hand" educationally, the 698 name of Brigham Young will always live among the Latter-day Saints and the world. Not alone because of the many schools he founded, but because of the practical emphasis he placed upon learning. In one of his sermons delivered in the Tabernacle, in October 1860, he said: Educate a young man in mineralogy in our schools, and what does he know? Take him into a field, where you think he will be useful, and you will find that one of the most unlearned of men who has made a little practical study of this subject will go around him a dozen times a day. Why? Because the educated cannot apply what he has received. Educate him as a surveyor. Well, he has to go into the field to labor and practice for a long time before he becomes proficient in that department. The education is good, but where the school drops them we leave them, and the result is, they have to get some other occupation to make a living. Where are the shoemakers and the manufacturers of woolen and cotton goods? Is there a man educated in Utah that can go right into a woolen or a cotton factory and understand the business? Is there a man that can go into the South and take up the business of manufacturing cotton goods? There is not such a man educated in the state, unless he is down South, and I doubt there being any there who can go into the cotton factory and know what to do with the machinery and the cotton. This is a languishing industry in Utah. There was an ox killed in one of the settlements with a certain brand on the hide. That ox hide was sold, and in about eight or ten months it returned to that settlement in the shape of sole leather, with the same brand on it. From the time it left Wellsville until it was returned here it had passed through the hands of eleven men, and we paid them for handling it. This is the system that we have been following. If it had not been for the mercy of God, who saw our ignorance and slothfulness and put it aside, this people would have been poor in temporal circumstances in these mountains. But I do believe that the time has come and sufficient information has been given us, that if we do not take hold of these things and do them properly God will make us responsible and we will suffer for it. I believe in education, but I want to see the boys and girls come out with an education at the fingers' ends as well as in their brains, that they may be able to support themselves. Take our girls who are educated and receive commissions to teach, and if they cannot get schools what do they do? They clerk in a store or do something or other that people can do who have had very little education and their time has been wasted, because their education has not been in the right direction. I believe today that God intends that this people shall take hold of these manufacturing institutions, and put their sons and daughters to such labor as is suited to them. Educate them in these things as well as in letters. If we don't do this, where shall we draw from for men with the capacity to build up Zion and make it a perfect home? It has been stated that Utah includes within her borders all that is necessary to make the people wealthy. But we are neglecting the very means that God has put in our hands to educate our children the right way. The time has come, in my opinion, when our schools, instead of having-so much in the line of gymnastics should give good manual training. They are good to develop the muscles it is true. If they developed them with the hoe, or the axe, or the plow, or something that is useful, it would do them more good. If we could have our little farms, our blacksmith shops, our turning lathes, our carpenter's shops, our factories, and educate our children in these things as they go along, we would turn out men who could be moulded and used for the benefit and upbuilding of the Zion of our God. Zion has to be built up, and we want men who are capable of superintending in every department. God designs that men should be educated for this purpose (Conference Reports, October 1860, PP. 44-45)- The threefold philosophy of instruction, so much a part of Brigham Young University graduates, stands out today in the lives of this great institution's sons and daughters. In all fields of useful endeavor the men and women of Brigham LESSON DEPARTMENT Young University are to be found. They possess not only the scholarship and practical training a well-rounded education affords, but, what is most important, they are given an emotional poise that can only come where religious instruction is given under the inspiration of the Priesthood and by those having authority to teach the truth, not merely the philosophies of religious thought. And so, out of the lack of wisdom which sent a humble youth to seek his Maker, has come a great Church with its attendant institutions of higher learning, its seminaries, and its Institutes of Religion. Wherever Latter-day Saints are gathered in numbers, on the grounds of high schools or the campuses of colleges or universities, there the Church has reached out to provide the teachings of the Lord. Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggested readings given below, have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part of the text to discover wherein we must "give heed unto his word." 1. A noted educator of a great eastern 699 university once made the following remark about Latter-day Saints he had come to know as students during his years of instruction at the institution: "How can a Mormon but succeed as a scholar when he believes God is walking beside him in his studies?" What teachings in our Church would implant such a belief in the youth? Read Do. And Cov. 88:67-80. Spend time discussing verse 67 of this passage. 2. Who may have claim upon the "Light of Christ,' who upon the "Gift of the Holy Ghost?" Read Doc. And Cov. 88:1-13. Compare verse 4 with verses 11-13. Will the answer to this question explain how all men of learning have arrived at truth? 3. One who would ascend the heights of learning must first be humble. Discuss. Read Doc. And Cov. 88:117-127. What are the lessons you would take to a student which are to be found in the passages assigned for reading in section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Give the class time to find and comment upon a choice. The complete story of the founding and development of an educational system among the Latter-day Saints cannot be outlined in an hour's lesson. Its spirit and purpose, however, may. For the teacher who would prepare more fully this lesson the text, Mormonism and Education by M. Lynn Bennion, is suggested. The many charts, lists of founding dates for schools and academies, personal accounts of leading men who brought about a system of learning for the youth of Zion are therein all interestingly recorded.
