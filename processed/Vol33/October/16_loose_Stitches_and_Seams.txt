Stitches and Seams Work Meeting Committee, Velma N. Simonsen, Chairman For Tuesday, January 14, 1947 Objective: To practice stitches on pieces of cloth brought to class by members; to discuss bastings, kinds, and uses. Textbook reference: The Complete Book of Sewing, Chapters 4 and 5. Stitches [ is the desire of every seamstress that her completed garment shall have a professional, finished appearance. The cause of many clothes having a homemade look is due to pulling the thread too tightly when stitching. Enough play should be _ allowed for smoothness, as well as strength, in seams. The running stitch is the basic process of all fine needlework. It is a series of short, even stitches requiring a particular muscular technique which is acquired only with practice. Gathers, shirrs, and tucks are all made with the running stitch technique, the difference being in the application of this stitch. Bastings are simple running stitches used for temporary joinings, some of them merely holding the pieces together while they are stitched. Seams and Edges Seams and edges make the structural lines of the garment. They give shape and design, and they form "eyepaths" along which the eye travels. Hence, it is very necessary that they be finished to perfection. To seam is to join two or more pieces of fabric together. Artistic seaming requires skill in the handling of material and finishing. Seams are judged on the right side for their beauty; on the wrong side for their security. Never cross one seam with another until the first has been pressed and finished, is the tule which governs artistic workmanship, and the master rule for good tailoring. It is desirable, when sewing seams on very thin material, to sew the material over thin paper. Assignment for February: Bring cut-out garment. If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men (Romans 12:18). LESSON DEPARTMENT 701  Revealed in Its Literature Lesson 3?
