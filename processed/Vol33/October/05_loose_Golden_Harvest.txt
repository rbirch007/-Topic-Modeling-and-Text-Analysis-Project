Golden Harvest Beatrice Rordame Parsons THERE was a picture of a farm on the billboard. There were big, white horses, sleek, brown cows, and baby chicks as yellow as butter. Bumpty had seen it a hundred times, but his blue eyes were wide and his four-year-old body was tense with excitement. "What does it say, Aunt Pamela? Read it to me, please!" Pamela had read it over and over. She did not have to lift her eyes to the sign. Monotonously, she repeated: "Be a good American. Help harvest the crops. America must feed the world. Spend your vacation at Byde-A-Wyle Farm." It was signed, "Dale Saunders, Owner." Bumpty jiggled eagerly. "Are we good Americans, Pam? Does it mean us?" Pam nodded carelessly, then hurried to explain: "It means everybody, not just us." Under her breath she added: "But definitely not little Pamela Farrington and her nephew, Stephen David, alias 'Bumpty' Wright." Pamela had no idea of burying herself in the country, being nineteen and a stenographer in a busy office. What was the use? Bumpty couldn't seem to understand that a girl needed to have fun every minute of her vacation. Bert, and the rest of her crowd, had planned so many exciting days at the beach, in the canyons... "You promised!" cried Bumpty, accusingly, Page 662 Pamela sighed. Bumpty seemed to find a promise in everything she said. When she had promised her sister that she would take care of Bumpty while Nan went to a distant city to care for a relative who was ill, Pamela hadn't dreamed that the job would be so trying. She had told herself that with her landlady, Mrs. Hudsen, to look after Bumpty on occasions, her vacation wouldn't be interrupted. And she wasn't going to have it interrupted by a trip to the country, anyway. She just had to make Bumpty understand. "T don't like the country, darling. It's too far away. And there are bugs, and worms, and..." "T like worms," said Bumpty, cheerfully. "I like bugs, too." Pamela threw up her hands in despair. "Oh, Bumpty, I just can't go off to the country like that! I've got to think about it." She had thought about it and the answer was No! "Anyway, I just said..." "You'd take me to the country," finished Bumpty with a wail. Pamela was glad they were passing an ice-cream shop. A cone changed the subject. Bumpty didn't mention the farm again. Well, she'd escaped that easily enough. Now for Bert and the crowd. Mrs. Hudsen had promised to sit 'with Bumpty while he was asleep. She kissed him as she tucked him into bed. He closed his eyes and his dark lashes made tiny shadows on his cheeks. His mouth was soft and smiling. GOLDEN HARVEST "We're going to the country in the morning," he said. PAMELA felt like snatching him up and spanking him. Instead, she tucked him gently into his blanket and decided that she loved him very much. But not enough to take him to the country! When she got to the drugstore on the corner where Bert and the crowd were waiting, she told him about Bumpty and the farm. He threw back his head and roared. "What could you do on a farm, Pam? You don't know a tractor from a plow. A typewriter's more your speed." Everyone laughed. Pamela joined in, but her laughter sounded hollow. Why did they all think her such a dumb bunny? "Or, maybe," continued Bert slyly, "you could use those little curlicues you put on paper to dig spuds with!" Again everybody laughed. Her small, red mouth looked a little stubborn. "I could learn." Bert tried to tease her. "Oh, girls, just look at that horrid grasshopper!" Bert was quite a clown. Usually she enjoyed his clowning. But not this time. She might be afraid of bugs and things but she wasn't a baby. Almost without thinking, she slipped from her stool. "Sorry, to break up your evening, Bert, but Pam's got to get home and pack. If you miss me just drop me a card at Byde-A-Wyle Farm. Bumpty and I are off bright and early in the morning." Even though she had said it? even though she had gone home to toss things into a suitcase Pamela couldn't quite believe that it was she and her nephew who rode the 663 bus to the Growers' Market, and hailed a ride in a Byde-A-Wyle truck. As the elderly driver stowed her bag, she muttered under her breath, "Why, I must be crazy! ['m not even sure they'll let me in, and as for Bumpty...." The driver's eyes twinkled under his graying brows as he lifted the little fellow into the high cab. "They'll let you in," he assured her comfortably, "and glad to have you. As for Bumpty, Grandie likes little boys and there's plenty of room." He got in beside them, and added gravely: "As for being crazy, you're just being sensible. If everyone would help a little it wouldn't be so hard." Pamela colored and hid her face while she wiped an imaginary speck of dirt from Bumpty's cheek. She hadn't really come to help. She had just wanted. To prove that being 'a stenographer didn't put her in class "D" for dumbbells. "Is your farm nice, Mr. Byde-Awyle?" asked Bumpty eagerly, as the truck rolled slowly along the highway. The driver laughed. "My name's Aaron Jones. I work for Dale." He told her how Grandie had managed the farm while Dale was in the marines, and about the bumper crop he had raised since he had come home. "The neighbors help when they can, and students from the high schools drop around when there aren't any classes. But they'll be glad you've come. No one else is there right now except Miss Nina Creighton, Dale's fiancee." They had left the highway now and were traveling along a lane edged with apple trees, heavy with russet 664 fruit. Aaron brought the truck to a halt before a white picket gate. "Welcome to Byde-A-Wyle!" he announced. The farm was so big it frightened Pamela. Acres and acres of growing things stretched across the valley towards the purple hills. While Aaron lifted Bumpty down and went to get the suitcase, Pamela looked about her. The house was tall and square, with an old-fashioned dignity in its sturdy lines that told of strength and firmness. There were flaming asters and zinnias along the fences, and a green lawn made a thick carpet on each side of the graveled walk. In the west field a new building was under' construction. Pamela eyed it curiously. It was dug deep into the earth and had a queer, rounded roof, with vents in it. The doors were at either end and wide enough for two trucks to pass in and out. Aaron saw her baffled look and grinned. "It's a root cellar, Miss Pamela, a place for storing root vegetables." He grinned. "When it's finished, Grandie's going to give a party. Well lay smooth boards over the dirt floor and bring in autumn leaves and fall flowers. There'll be colored lanterns and a long table across one end for refreshments. There'll be square dances..." He broke off, giving her an intent look. "Ever been to a regular country shindig, Miss Pamela?"; Pamela was glad to confess, "What I don't know about farms would fill a five-foot bookshelf!" She realized suddenly that she had no business at Byde-A-Wyle farm. She was... Why, she was an imposter! She couldn't really be of help. She turned to ask Aaron to take her back to town, and found the truck lumbering off toward one of the fields. Aaron smiled and waved to Bumpty, who was already inside the white picket gate. Pamela ran after him in panic. She had to get away before Dale and his grandmother learned what a fraud she was. She caught Bumpty's hand. "Darling, we've got to go right back!" "But you've only just come," objected a hearty masculine voice, and Pamela looked up to find a tall, young man and a beautiful, blond young woman coming towards her. Behind, followed an old woman with silvery hair and smile-wrinkles about the keenest brown eyes into which Pamela had ever looked. She knew she was Grandie before she spoke. "We're tickled to have you," said Mrs. Saunders hospitably. She introduced her grandson and his fiancee, and added pleasantly: "Aaron said you were afraid you wouldn't be much help. But don't worry. If you're willing to learn, everything will be all right." She held out her hand to Bumpty and asked, "Would you like to help me feed the hens?" And to her grandson, she added, ""Take Pamela's bag upstairs, Dale, and bring the. Old crib down from the attic." PAMELA felt breathless and happy and excited as she followed Dale and Nina up the stairs and into the small bedroom with dormer windows framed in crisp, white curtains. While Dale went for the crib, Nina spoke disdainfully. "That crib's been in the family for generations. I tell Dale he's in GOLDEN HARVEST a rut. If he doesn't soon get away, he'll be here for generations, too." All of a sudden, Pamela knew that she had fallen in love with Byde-Awyle farm. Her smile was shy, yet truthful. "I should think it was a very nice place to be in a rut in," she said quietly. Nina frowned and wrinkled her nose. "That's because you've only just come. You'll find that its lonesome, and far away from town. I like bright, new, shiny things. When Dale and I are married, we're going to take a cute, modern apartment as near the business district. As possible." When she had gone, Pamela found herself thinking of Dale in a bright, shiny, new apartment, and somehow she felt sorry for him. Three days later she felt sorry for herself! She ached in muscles she hadn't known existed. She crawled into bed each night wondering if she would be able to move in the morning. But the old rooster who brought the sun shining over the tops of the eastern mountains called her to the fields. Dale taught her many things about farming. He talked of his dreams and ambitions for the farm, and she saw love for his land shining from his clear, brown eyes. She came to know, too, how it pained him to think of leaving it. But he was loyal to Nina. "She was brought up in the city. It wouldn't be fair to ask her to make a home here. She'd be so unhappy," he explained. Pamela wanted to remind him that he'd been brought up on a farm, that he would be miserable in town. But she pressed her lips tight- 665 ly together and told herself that it was none of her business. Why, just a few days ago she hadn't liked farms, either! Time went so fast that, suddenly, Pamela was surprised to find that her vacation was almost over. Great mounds of the root vegetables were ready for storing, and Grandie had set the date of her party for Saturday. Pamela and Bumpty would ride into town with one of the trucks on Monday morning. Pamela felt sad when she thought of leaving. She was going to miss Byde-A-Wyle, Aaron, Grandie, and Dale. She knew, with a queer little twist in her heart, that she was going to miss Dale more than anyone else. But she wouldn't let her thoughts dwell on that. Early Saturday morning, several neighbors invaded Grandie's bright kitchen to help with the party preparations. There were cakes to bake and pies to fill. There were heaping platters of sandwiches to be prepared, for the entire countryside had been invited. ALE and Bumpty turned the huge ice-cream freezer on the back porch, then packed it with salt and ice, and went gaily off to finish decorating the root cellar. Late in the afternoon, during a lull, Pamela brought her best white-embroidery frock into the cool kitchen to press, while Grandie filled platters with spicy cookies just out of the oven. Nina, dressed for the street, came into the room and eyed Pamela's pressing with scornful glances. "You don't really mean, Pam, to dance with those country bumpkins! It would bore me to tears. I've asked 666 Dale to take me to town for the opening of the Artistic Club. Pamela shot her a quick glance to be silent, but Grandie had heard; and her face turned a little white. Pamela protested in an indignant whisper. "You can't do that. Grandie's planning on Dale to help with the patty." Grandie's voice came gently. "Tf Dale would rathet. Go to town, Pamela, it's all right with me." But in spite of her brave words, Pamela caught the tremor in her voice. She watched Grandie take a covered plate of cookies into the pantry before she spoke. "Nina, you can't..." Nina interrupted sharply, "Now don't you butt in. Dale and I've just had a quarrel about it." She pulled on her gloves. "I've told him I'm going into town to have my hair and nails done. If he doesn't come in to take me to the club, I'll... I)... Well, Il break our engagement." Pamela stared at her unbelievingly. "But that's not fair. Dale loves you. He also loves Grandie. You can't make him choose between you." Nina laughed: jeeringly. "Can't I? Well, we'll see! It's about time he made up his mind about Grandie and this old farm." Pamela's lips were stiff. "Don't you know that he's already made it up, Nina? Dale loves this farm. He hopes you'll love it, too." "Love it," cried Nina, her lips curling, "I hate it! If marrying Dale means I've got to stay here, then I won't marry him." She looked at Pamela, her eyes flashing with anger. "Why are you standing up for him, and Grandie and the farm? Is it because you want to stay here with him?" Her laughter was cutting. "Oh, Pam, I know it, if you don't. You've fallen in love with him." Pamela's face was white. "No, no!" she protested, but even as she said it, she knew that Nina was right. Nina saw the truth in her clear eyes. Her own flickered angrily. "But," she said thinly, "I don't think it's going to do you any good. I think I know Dale. He'll come into town." She smiled confidently as she went through the door. Pamela stared after her, while the iron burned the ironing board cover. She didn't look up until Grandie set the iron back on the rack. 'Then Grandie put her arm about Pamela and held her close for a moment. "T couldn't help hearing," she said quietly. "We both love Dale, but there's nothing we can do. He's a man. He must make his own decisions." She drew Pamela's dress from the board and put it in her hands. "Remember, dear, we're having a patty. We musn't let anything spoil it. Not even our own feelings." "Not even our own feelings!"' Pamela wanted to cry out. She wanted to say: I can't laugh and dance and smile while my heart is aching. But she didn't speak. Grandie was depending on her. She went slowly upstairs. An hour later she saw Dale take the car and head for town. Her entire body felt frozen, and when she dressed, her fingers were stiff and awkward. BUMPTY, who had pleaded to be allowed to go to the party, jiggled excitedly between Grandie, GOLDEN HARVEST in her best gray silk dress, and Pamela, in her white one, as they entered the root cellar. It was a bower of colored lanterns, fall flowers, and autumn leaves, Bumpty's small chest swelled with pride. "Me and Dale did it. We fixed everything, Aaron helped." He skipped happily towards the loaded refreshment table and cried: "Aunt Pam, I'm going to eat all the cake and cookies and ice cream But for all his fine words, Pamela found him a Short time later, fast asleep, a huge dish of ice cream melting at his side. She smiled as she Picked him up and carried him to his room. He smiled sleepily as she undressed him, and said, "I'm glad we came to the country! Pamela wasn't glad. She almost wished she were back in the drug. Store with Bert and her crowd. If she hadn't come to Byde-A-Wyle her heart wouldn't have felt so big_ and empty in her breast. She was crossing the cornfield, when she heard Dale's voice. "Pam! Pamela!" Tt was a minute before she realized that he was coming towards parked his car, her side she tried was a little unsure. "Surely the Artistry Club isn't closed so early." She could see his face under the huge, silver harvest moon which had climbed into the sky. It was so stern it frightened her. "I didn't go to the club. I went 667 to ask Nina to come back to the Party." He paused and said harshly: "She isn't coming back, Pam. She isn't ever coming back to Byde-Awyle." Pam put a comforting hand on his arm, "Oh, Dale, I'm 50 sorry!" He turned so that she could see his eyes, They were free from anger and disappointment, and were clear and bright. "Don't be. I'm not. Not really." His voice was very low. "I think I've known for a long time that Nina and I could never be happy. It couldn't have been a real mar. Tiage, Pani." Suddenly, he put his hands on her slim shoulders and turned her so throat. "Tt's been a golden harvest, Pam," he said softly, "the first of many to come, When a man Matties, he needs a wife who loves the land as he does. Someday..." His voice Was so low she had to bend to hear it, "Someday, I'll tell you more about It." His eyes held a promise that stirred her heart. Then he smiled. "Now we must go back to the party. I want Grandie to know I'm back." Walking slowly beside him towards the light and laughter, Pamela smiled through the stars which had become lighted in the depths of her eyes, "If it hadn't been for Bumpty," she said whimsically, trying to hide the happiness in her heart, "I might never have come to Byde-A-Wyle at all." As though the thought were something he could not bear to imagine, he swept her into his arms and out into the middle of the dancers. Pioneer Stories and Incidents A STAMPEDE ON THE PLAINS President Amy Brown Lyman (This is the fourth in a series of true pioneer incidents to be published by Thein honor of the 1947 Utah Centennial celebration? ) RESIDENT EMMELINE B. WELLS often remarked that one of the most terrifying experiences of her life was witnessing a stampede of animals which occurred on the plains in the company of Bishop Newel K. Whitney, in the fall of 1848. It appears that animals as well as people, often, on those long journeys, suffered from fear and anxiety, as well as from thirst, hunger, and fatigue. As Sister Wells related the incident, which she always made vivid and dramatic, the trouble followed a long and weary day of travel. After camp had been made and supper and devotions were over, the company, foregoing the usual recreational activities, had retired early and were sleeping soundly. As was the custom of the pioneers, the wagons had been formed into a sort of circular or oval corral with the tongues pointing outside, and with a front wheel of each wagon locked in a rear wheel of the wagon ahead. Two openings or exits had been left opposite each other and a guard stationed at each of them. In this enclosure the animals were held for safety. Just before daybreak, there was a terrible commotion among the animals. For some unknown reason they had become disturbed and were soon unmanageable, despite all efforts to control them. They rushed Page 668 about, the oxen and cows bellowing and snorting as if they were mad? horses, oxen, steers, and cows all mixed up together. The noise and confusion and stamping of feet were so great that the very ground seemed to shake. The frightened animals jammed against one another and against the wagons, causing damage to both. Women and children were frightened into a panic, many screaming and crying, and some fainting. Finally, the animals broke through the openings and rushed out into the open prairie. Fortunately, several horses were caught and, upon these, men leaped and followed the herd. As the confusion subsided in camp and the immediate danger seemed to be over, new worries and anxieties developed. It was discovered that two children were missing, that one man had sustained a broken leg, and that another had been knocked down and lay unconscious a short distance away. Then there began to be anxiety and fear regarding the safety of the camp, left as it now was in the vast, lonely wilderness; and, added to this, there was great concern regarding the safety of the animals and the men who had followed them. It was feared, at first, that perhaps the two children, running away from the terrifying scene had PIONEER STORIES AND INCIDENTS encountered other dangers; but they were finally located, hidden deep down in a wagon box under a feather bed and other covers, where they had almost smothered. Like horses frightened at a fire, it was hard to induce them to come out to safety. It was not until late afternoon and many miles away, that the frightened and excited animals were finally brought under control, and returned 669 to camp. Several had been injured, and all of them were so nervous and exhausted that they had to be carefully cared for and comforted throughout the following night. None, however, was lost. The two injured men were properly cared for; the necessary repairs about the camp were made; and, on the second morning after this trying experience, the journey was once more resumed.
