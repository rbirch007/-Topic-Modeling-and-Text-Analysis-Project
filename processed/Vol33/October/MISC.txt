YESTERDAYS Beatrice K. Ekman I There are so many little ghosts that haunt my memory? The scent of lilacs after rain, leaves falling from a tree. Up from the lands of yesterday the little ghosts come, one by one; I bar my door but through the day into my thoughts they run. II I remember the golden autumn days In my valley far away, Where drifting shadows, through purple haze, On the mountains and brown fields lay. I remember the scarred peaks, sheer and tall, Reaching up from the timber line, And the maples flaming the creviced wall Of the canyon's steep incline. I remember the crimsoned inland sea When the sunset reddened the sky, And the stars that faded pallidly When the dawn came up like a cry. Today, by an unfamiliar sea, I watch the returning tide, The hills of my valley are calling me While the rolling breakers ride. Ill You had been gone for a year and a day And I stood by your door alone; Long shadows over the garden lay; Overhead a pale star shone. Ivy shuttered, your window pane, The vines on the chimney stirred, And from the hedge in the narrow lane Came the lonely call of a bird. Only the silence answered me? A silence strange and new, Then out of my grief and longing My soul called out to you. And out of the dusk and silence, Certain as sound and flame, I knew that you stood beside me? I knew that you spoke my name. The Cover: "When the Work's All Done" From a Photograph by Willard Luce VOL. 33, NO. 10 OCTOBER 1946 AVAR D FAIRBANKs the "Pioneer Mother" Monument in Vancouver,
