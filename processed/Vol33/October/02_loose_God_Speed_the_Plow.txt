GOD SPEED THE PLOW (Inscribed on an Old Cup in Pioneer Exhibit) Let the wealthy and great Roll in splendor and state; I envy them not, I declare it. I eat my own lamb, My own chickens and ham; I shear my own fleece and I wear it. I have lawns, I have bowers, I have fruits, I have flowers; The lark is my morning alarmer. So jolly boys now Here's God speed the plow, Long life and success to the farmer. Historical Pamphlet, October 1942, Compiled by Kate B. Carter.
