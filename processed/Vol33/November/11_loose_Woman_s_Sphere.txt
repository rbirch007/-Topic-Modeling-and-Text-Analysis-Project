Page 751 EDITORIAL VOL. 33 NOVEMBER 1946 NO. 11 She Looketh Well to the Ways of Her Household; How' often one hears the expression, "She is a good manager," and then the speaker recounts how the woman in question makes many of her own and her children's clothing, beautifies and furnishes her home with the workmanship of her hands, exercises thrift in buying, and performs many tasks for herself, thus saving money. It reminds one of the woman spoken of in Proverbs who "looketh well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread of idleness." It shows that women living at any time in the world's history are much the same? some being provident and others wasteful and indolent. For these past few years during the days of prosperity, Church leaders have urged Latter-day Saints to free themselves from debt. Now, with prices of all commodities spiraling, fortunate is the family which heeded this advice and does not find itself in subjugation to debt. Today it is vital to the welfare of every family that the mother be a "good manager." She will have much to do in determining the financial status of her family. Great contrasts in living and surroundings may be found in the case of two men mak. Ing comparable wages. The "good manager" mother will see that she has put by an adequate supply of Page 752 ?Proverbs 31/297 fruits, vegetables, and other foodstuffs for the coming winter. She will rejoice as -she views her full shelves. Her children will be well supplied with clothing, many of them fashioned or remodeled by her hands. Her home, in its beauty, will reflect her industry, and growing plants in her windows will lend an air of springtime even on the coldest winter day. Contrast this home of order and beauty with the home where a mother does not manage well. Either through a lack of knowledge or indolence, her storehouse is not supplied for the coming season, and throughout the winter she will be buying out-of-season food at high prices. Her children may not be supplied with adequate, reasonably-priced clothing, for money will be squandered on second-grade merchandise through a lack of means to buy the best at the present inflated prices. This woman's husband will not be able to get ahead, as was the husband of the prudent woman, because his wife is unskilled in homemaking arts, or else is indolent. Relief Society has a responsibility toward every Latter-day Saint woman to offer and seek to improve her homemaking skills, and, if a woman's home responsibilities keep her from attending Relief Society work EDITORIAL meetings, an effort should be put forth to give her help and instruction in her own home. Whether a sister needs help in improving her cooking, sewing, budgeting, or keeping her house clean, Relief Society should be prepared to offer instruction on better and more efficient methods along all these lines of homemaking. For the past ten years, through the Welfare Plan, Church leaders have pleaded with the saints to prepare themselves for the times ahead. The 753 women of the Church must do the share devolving upon them as the mothers in the home in preserving and producing the necessities of the home, such as food and clothing, so that they may fully support their husbands, the bearers of the Priesthood, in the work which will be dependent upon them in the future times. "Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates" (Proverbs 31:31).
