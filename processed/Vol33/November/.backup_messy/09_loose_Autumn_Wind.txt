AUTUMN WIND Katherine Fernelius Larsen The wind is a wandering minstrel In the autumn time; He chants of far-off places Where the bells of temples chime; He plucks the brittle branches Toa gypsy song, And sings of moon-drenched southern seas And white roads beckoning, Far and long. Oh, I would up and be away To join him in his roving, But for the household tasks to do? Ah, such the bonds of loving!
