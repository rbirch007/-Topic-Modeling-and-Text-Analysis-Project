FRIENDLY TOWN Bertha A. Kleinman I'm glad I live within a Friendly Town Where old and young are tolerant of me, Where many smile and few there be who frown, No matter what my misdemeanors be. I'm glad I live within a neighborhood, Where friendly folk exact so little test, Where slander falls away, and only good Induces me to measure to my best. I'm glad I live within a family sphere Where folk forgive the all I should have been, Where, when I fail, they love me just as dear And lift me up to try and try again. Yes, here I am the happiest to be, Among my own who strive the most with me. "
