Elliott, member, Relief Society General Board. The photograph was taken in front of the Eastern States mission home in Philadelphia, May 4, 1946. Sister Doxey describes her appreciation and the enjoyment the members of her mission received from the visit of the General Board members: "It was indeed a pleasure for us to welcome President Spafford, Sister Edith Elliott and Sister Priscilla Evans to Philadelphia. I am sure that all who had an opportunity to be present at the Relief Society conference were delighted and pleased with the instructions they received. We are making the conference messages available to our members throughout the mission, inasmuch as there are so many who could not attend conference and who expressed regret in not having this privilege. We feel this was the next best thing to do. I was very happy that it was my privilege to be in attendance at the Palmyra meetings, and this feeling was increased when I learned that Sister Spafford and Sister Elliott were also there. I join with you in the belief that as long as our young people can bear testimony of the kind given in the missionary meeting at the Hill Cumorah, there is certainly no reason to fear for the future of the Church."

Spafford, General President of Relief Society, and Sister Edith Elliott, a member of the General Board. Sister Spafford was the principal speaker at the Sunday evening M. I. A. Fireside held at the New England mission home. Her talk was by nature of a travelogue in which she told of her visit to the Eastern States. "The following day, May 13th, was devoted to a Relief Society conference at which Sister Spafford and Sister Elliott gave encouragement and instructions to the Relief Society sisters of the mission. After Sister Elliott's introductory remarks, Sister Spafford stressed the duties of executive officers. She told the group to work unitedly, planning all their work together as a group. She advised each Relief Society to be wise in the expenditure of funds. She gave instructions regarding the annual report. "In the afternoon session, Sister Spafford continued her instructions, detailing the procedure advised at the visiting teachers' report meeting. Sister Elliott then outlined and defined the cultural and educational programs for the coming year. The meeting was closed with an expression of thanks from Sister Reeder to Sister Spafford and Sister Elliott for their visit, and to the members of the New England Mission Relief Societies for their faithfulness in attending the conference."

Spafford, and Edith S. Elliott, a member of the General Board: "On Sunday, May 19, we held three sessions of Relief Society conference at Montreal, where the women of Eastern Canada heard of the activities and accomplishments of Latter-day Saint women from the lips of their General President, and of the aims and plans for the years ahead from Sister Elliott. The newly organized Singing Mothers group, under the talented leadership of Sister Lois Draney, who officiated at the pipe organ and as conductor, rendered four very inspirational and creditable numbers. Both afternoon and evening sessions were largely attended, some women coming many  miles to be present, and lingering long after each session, loath to leave the inspiration there.

A pleasant feature of the afternoon meeting was the presentation of small gold maple leaf pins to the visitors by Jessie R.
