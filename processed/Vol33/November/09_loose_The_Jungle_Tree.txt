THE JUNGLE TREE Elsie F. Parton Gaunt, scarred and bare, bereft of beauty! Observer of the centuries now past! What suffering, what trials have you witnessed? What joys, what sorrows have their shadows cast, As sentinel you stood on the mountain summit, The jungle sweeping dense beneath your brow? How can they tell who never knew your beauty? How can they weep who first behold you now? Your questing roots, when first the rich earth piercing. Gleaned strength and beauty for your leafy arms. The tropic deluge bathed your olive beauty, And blazing sunbeams pierced your shadowed charms. Here, dusky maidens met their friends and lovers, Exotic flowers entwined their raven hair; They vowed and visioned dim, uncertain futures, With only you their ecstasy to share. Aloft you stand, bereft of all your glory! No more before the tempest you will bow. The jungle winds are whispering around you? But you are dead and cannot hear them now. Page 749
