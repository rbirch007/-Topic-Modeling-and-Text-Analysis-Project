A Visit to Church Shrines Edith S. Elliott Member, Relief Society General Board WHEN planning spring Relief W Society conventions for the eastern stakes, and some of the missions at the request of President George Albert Smith, Sister Spafford and I were aware that our journeyings would pass near some of the Church shrines. With this in mind, we allowed time for a visit to the Prophet Joseph Smith's birthplace at Sharon, Vermont; to Palmyra, New York, where he spent his youth and received his first vision; and to Nauvoo, Illinois, where he spent his last days. Our first tip to a Church shrine began at Cambridge, Massachusetts, early one May morning in President Reeder's comfortable car. The "we" consisted of President William S.

I must mention the woodpiles seen beside each house, as wood is used for both heating and cooking. The neat piles were huge! If wishes were horses, I would now have one of those woodpiles stacked in my own yard to feed my fireplace this winter. Through this lovely, picturesque setting, we followed the road into Vermont. We passed through the little town of South Royalton, then on to the spot revered by all Latter-day Saints the birthplace of our Prophet. I cannot think of a more peaceful or beautiful place for a prophet to be born. From the top of the everlasting hills, covered with pines and maples, to the lush grasses in the valleys, calmness and serenity abounded. It was no effort to imagine what the birthplace might have been like a humble farmhouse, containing love, honor, intelligence, and
