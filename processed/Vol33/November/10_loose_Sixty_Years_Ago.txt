Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent November 1, and November 15, 1886 "For THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ZION AND THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ALL Nations" EDITORIAL NOTES: To encourage the patrons of the Woman's Exponent, we have decided to give to each subscriber of the paper, at Christmas time, 4 picture, which will be suitable for framing, of one of the most notable women of the Church? Lucy Smith, the mother of the Prophet Joseph. It is said by those who were personally acquainted with the lady, to be an excellent likeness. AUTUMNAL TINTS: There is no season of the year when the earth is more magnificent in its glory and beauty than the Autumn, and especially October. In September the leaves begin to fade and turn yellow, and sometimes the pale blue sky is dim OF Jaden, but the mellow October days are rife with beauty.--- The fallen leaves what sentiment they call up in the human heart, and how one loves to tread upon them, what poetical thoughts they inspire. Immense flocks of blackbirds sail across the pathway and over the brown fields, lighting among the soft willows that frame the water's edge.--- The murmuring music of the leaves when the Autumn breeze begins to sway the trees, and they bend and sigh and moan, has something so pensive in it, that it thrills the human heart and softens it like the music of the harp with a thousand chords gently played by a skillful hand. Aunt Em APOSTROPHE Oh, Sympathy! Thou dear and holy thing, Be not abashed fear not to reach thy hand Unto the weary and the sorrowing, To soothe, to strengthen, and to help them stand. Oh Justice! Thou hast waited long so long; Thy look is fierce and searching, like the sun; Thy voice ls sharp, thine arm is firm and strong, Who shall abide when thy day's work is done? ?Lula POETS AND POETRY:..Poetry is that sentiment of the soul, or faculty of the mind, which enables its possessor to appreciate and realize the heights and depths of human experience. It is the power to feel pleasure OF suffer pain, in all its exquisiteness and intensity. - -- Nearly all men and women are poetical to some extent, but very few of them can be called poets..-- The greater the poet the greater ls his capacity to suffer and enjoy.--- They who express most must likewise feel most, both of pleasure and pain... - There are some people who think there is no poetry in religion..- Religion is full of poetry, and poetry is full of religion.--- Poets do not always know what great truths they are telling. Like the prophets, whom they so much resemble, they have in all ages "builded better than they knew."... Thus, is poetry shown to be the elder sister of history, the mother of language, and the ancestress of civilization.--- But the end is not yet. There are heights to climb which have never been surmounted; depths to fathom which still remain unsounded. Orson F, Whitney. Page 750
