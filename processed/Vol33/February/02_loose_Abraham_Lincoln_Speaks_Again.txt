Abraham Lincoln Speaks Again Vesta P. Crawford TODAY the career of Abraham Lincoln is being remembered with a new vividness and a new devotion. There are many who think once more of his famous "House Divided" speech and of his immortal words—"With malice toward none." Abraham Lincoln has been called the Great American, the Kingly Commoner, the World's Foremost Citizen. More than four thousand full-length books have been written about his life. Songs and plays have celebrated his words and deeds, his name is a household word throughout the land. It is still the American dream that the most humble boy may some day become President. One of Lincoln's best friends analyzed his remarkable rise to power in these simple words: How such a man as Lincoln could walk up to the highest point of human grandeur, from such low origin, God only knows. But he was so ordained from the beginning, and so it is. From among the thousands of poems written in honor of the Great Emancipator, there is one outstanding composition that bears a message for our times. Written with reference to the first World War and what might have been Lincoln's attitude towards it, this poem is just as true, just as vivid, today and there is a world of thought back of each simple line. At this time of remembering Lincoln, this honoring of his birth. Day, it is entirely suitable to recall the words of the poem "Abraham Lincoln Walks at Midnight." The author is Vachel Lindsay who was born in Springfield, Illinois, in the year 1870. From his boyhood Vachel was familiar with the streets where Lincoln walked, the houses where he lived, the courts where he tried his cases, the fields where he wandered in contemplation. Vachel grew up on the Lincoln stories of how Abraham walked along the streets reading a book, sometimes not even noticing the people who passed, how he stayed very late in his law office pondering over the intricacies of the State code, how he made speeches, homely, understandable speeches, in the days when he was running for office. Vachel Lindsay was familiar with the history of Lincoln's life and he knew also the feel of the same country, the reach of the prairie, the solitude of the forest, the tide of the rivers. He knew the same type of people that Lincoln had known. Very early he heard the story of how young "Abe" came from Indiana to Illinois. This man, this long, tall, bony, homely, wiry, sad, gloomy man floated into our country in 1831, in a frail canoe down the north fork of the Sangamon River, friendless, penniless, powerless, and alone, tagged, struggling for the common necessities of life. In the years between 1905 and 1910 when Vachel Lindsay, the young poet-reformer, was lecturing Page 79 for the Y. M. C. A. And the Anti-Saloon League, he was particularly interested in studying what had been Lincoln's attitude toward the temperance question. He collected the statements of such men as James Gourley, who said: Lincoln was a great temperance man..... He would go afoot five or ten miles to talk..... I got him to join the Sons of Temperance in 1854. And once Lincoln said, "I never drink and am entitled to no credit therefor, because I hate the stuff." Vachel Lindsay studied every phase of Lincoln's character before he began writing his famous poem. The opening lines strike a contemplative mood: It is portentous, and a thing of state That here at midnight in our little town, A mourning figure walks and will not rest, Near the old court-house pacing up and down. No doubt Lindsay was thinking back to what Springfield must have been like when Lincoln first came to the place in 1837, the year that Springfield became the capital of Illinois. Lincoln had left the New Salem country to the east where, two years before, he had seen Ann Rutledge die. She was only twenty-two then, golden-haired and blue-eyed, and Lincoln, who was twenty-six, was already a member of the State Legislature and a man of ability and promise. The poem, in the second verse, tells of the places in Springfield where Lincoln walked: Or by his homestead or in shadowed yards He lingers where his children used to play; Or through the market on the well-worn stones, He walks until the dawn-stars burn away. BY his homestead. That tall house where he and his wife, Mary Todd, lived for many years. The house where Robert Todd Lincoln was born in the year 1843, the place where the other Lincoln boys spent their happiest days, a house where children's voices echoed through the big rooms. The well-worn stones of the street where Lincoln pulled his children in their little wagon. The streets where Lincoln talked with his neighbors who helped him to see the vital problems that faced not only Springfield but every town in America. A bronzed lank man! His suit of ancient black, A famous high-top hat and plain worn shawl, Make his the quaint figure that men love, The prairie lawyer, master of us all. This portrait of Lincoln is familiar to everyone, familiar from picture and poem and story. It has been said that when "Lincoln was moved by some great or good feeling—by some idea of liberty or justice or right—then he seemed an inspired man. It was then that Lincoln's nature was beautiful and in complete harmony with the laws of the great Eternal..... Lincoln was a great man, a good man, and a pure one, and beneath his rough exterior nature wove her fine network." He cannot sleep upon his hillside now, He is among us—as in times before! And we who toss and lie awake for long Breathe deep, and start, to see him pass the door. Upon his hillside. The tomb of Lincoln lies in Oak Ridge Cemetery, Springfield, Illinois. 'The monument which dedicates the burial plot is  ABRAHAM LINCOLN SPEAKS AGAIN made of brick faced with Quincy granite. An obelisk 135 feet high rises from the monument. BUT Vachel Lindsay, the poet, thinks of Lincoln as still alive in the city he loved. His head is bowed. He thinks of men and kings. Yea, when the sick world cries, how can he sleep? Too many peasants fight, they know not why; Too many homesteads in black terror weep. The sins of all the war-lords burn his heart. He sees the dreadnaughts scouring every main. He carries on his shawl-wrapped shoulders now The bitterness, the folly and the pain, Here the interpretation of Lincoln's character is given in its broad strength. For this American believed unwaveringly in the possibilities of everyone. To him there was no living soul who did not have "a kernel of divinity." One of Lincoln's associates, in analyzing his elements of greatness, said: "He was a kind, tender, and sympathetic man, feeling deeply in the presence of suffering, pain, wrong, Or oppression in any shape.... He was just to men, he loved the night, the good, the true, with all his soul. He was always noble..... Mr. Lincoln now stands up against the deep blue sky, the grandest figure of the age." 81 He cannot rest until a spirit dawn Shall come—the shining hope of Europe fie: The league of sober folk, the Worker's Earth, Bringing long peace to cornland, Alp and sea, Those who were privileged to live in Lincoln's generation have borne witness of his limitless courage. "If he was defending right, defending liberty, eulogizing the Declaration of Independence, then he extended out his arms, the palms of his hands upwards, as if appealing to some superior power for assistance and support. It was at such moments that he seemed inspired, fresh from the hands of the Creator," Lincoln's gray eyes would flash fire when he was speaking against slavery, and they spoke volumes of hope and love when he referred to justice, liberty, and the progress of mankind. It breaks his heart that kings must murder still, That all his hours of travail here for men Seem yet in vain. And who will bring white peace That he may sleep upon his hill again? The poem ends with a question, a challenge—who will there be in this time of need to uphold the ideals of Abraham Lincoln and place them upon a standard high enough for all the world to see?
