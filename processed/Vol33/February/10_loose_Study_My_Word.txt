Study My Word Study my word which hath gone forth among the children of men, and also study my word which shall come forth among the children of men, or that which is now translating, yea, until you have obtained all which I shall grant unto the children of  men in this generation, and then shall all things be added thereto (Doc. and Gov. 11:22) . EVERY Latter-day Saint should study the word of the Lord and copies of the standard works of the Church should be in every home. As a child grows to maturity, he should be given, on appropriate occasions, copies of the standard works to form a nucleus for his own library. When the oldest child in a family reaches the age of understanding, simple stories from the scriptures may be told him, showing an appropriate picture to illustrate the story and help fix it in his mind. Then, as the oldest child grows in years, a convenient time each day may be chosen when the entire family can gather as a group and hear portions of the scriptures read. Different methods may be used in order to ground the children in the doctrine of the Church. One mother tried the plan of reading to her children in a chrono-logical order with the Bible as a basis. For instance, after reading the account of Adam, as given in Genesis, then the fuller account, as told in the Pearl of Great Price, was read and commented upon. Following this, any verses which referred to Ad-am in the Doctrine and Covenants were studied, and then remarks which the Prophet Joseph Smith had made concerning Adam, were add-ed. By following such a procedure, as the reading from the Bible progressed, not only were the truths contained in the scriptures studied, but also the inter-relationship of the standard works was made clear, and the necessity for searching out all the light possible on a given subject was emphasized. Reading the scriptures together as a family draws the members more closely together and opens up vistas of understanding and inspiration which will prove a source of strength to them throughout life. To read of the dealings of God with his children in any dispensation is to bring comfort and enlargement to the soul. When trials come, there enters a calmness in one's thoughts on reading the words of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith during his trials: My son, peace be unto thy soul, thine adversity and thine affliction shall be but a small moment; and then if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high, thou shalt triumph over all thy foes (Doc. and Gov.121:7).Page 99  What comfort came to those who lost a loved one during this last conflict to read: And it shall come to pass that those that die in me shall not taste of death, for it shall be sweet unto them (Doc. and Cov. 42:46). Whatever the occasion, whether it be one of rejoicing or one of sorrow, the student of the scriptures can find encouragement and solace from reading particular passages which relate experiences of others similar to his own, and the words of the Lord to them under such circumstances. Mothers should realize that the responsibility of teaching their children the doctrines of the Church rests, not upon the Church auxiliaries, but upon the parents (see Doc. and Cov. 69). Early training from hearing the scriptures read and taking part in the reading, will bear fruit throughout the life of the child, and, at the same time, add enrichment and joy to be gained in no other way. Rays of living light will thus early enter the soul of the child and serve to guide his footsteps throughout mortality. M.C.S.
