Elsie C. Carroll "Grandma! I would not let him use that name, If I were you," she said. "It makes me think of wrinkled cheeks, Of nodding gray old head. "It makes me think of tottering feet And eyes that time has dimmed; Of wandering mind and quavering voice, And lips that pain has thinned. "It makes me think of gnarled brown hands, And shoulders bent by years;  It makes me think of winter, death; It chills me with vague fears." I smiled and answered her, "I see That life has not been fair. She took too early from you, dear, A gift I hold most rare. "Grandma! That name to me brings memories Of joys beyond mere words. It's sweet like dawn, and spring, And flowers, and brooks, and birds. "Her feet came swiftly to my need. Her cheek was soft as down; Her eyes were pools of love for me; Her hair a silver crown. "Her hands held strength and gentleness; Her kiss could soothe all pain; The refuge of her arms and lap Gave peace I'd like again. "It makes you think of winter, death; And fills you with strange fears. To me, the name of Grandma makes A blessing of the years. "And when J hear him calling it, I'm thrilled with ecstasy. 'O make me, Father,' is my prayer, "The Grandma I should be.' "
