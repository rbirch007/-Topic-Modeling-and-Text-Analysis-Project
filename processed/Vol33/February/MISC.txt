MAGAZINE VOL. 33, NO. 2 FEBRUARY 1946 THE DREAM IS OURS Christie Lund Coles If Washington could come to Valley Forge And stand where gallant men gave precious life, These are, perhaps, the words that he would say, Beholding man's disunity and strife: "You, living, would preserve your heritage Had you but seen the cost of freedom, known the hope That calls to the downtrodden of the world, Sensed its promise and visualized its scope." If Lincoln could return from out the night, Beyond the misted stars that guard his sleep, He'd stand before us, heavy-laden, sad With eyes too full of weariness to weep. And he would say, I think, if he could speak: 'We fought our battle well. We won the fight. We died for a great cause, that brotherhood Be born and grow into a living light. "How can your hearts betray us, we who died, Who cannot rest with war stalking the earth; Who know how many have been crucified To bring this hard-won freedom into birth. "Now, now before it is forever late, Search well your souls, let go your greed and lust, Unite together for the common good, And make a world to justify our trust." If Washington and Lincoln could return To stand upon these loved and sacred shores, They'd say: "The duty and the dream were ours... And now the duty... And the dream... Are yours!"

Cottam —Photograph courtesy South Dakota State Highway Commission, Pierre, South Dakota "THE SHRINE OF DEMOCRACY," MOUNT RUSHMORE MEMORIAL, SOUTH DAKOTA American Statesmen—Their Attitude Toward God Elder El Ray L. Christiansen President Logan Temple HAT America has a divine destiny is shown by the decrees of the Almighty as recorded in the scriptures. In the Book of Mormon the Lord has said: _.. Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall be free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations under heaven, if they will but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ (Ether 2:12). This is a wonderful promise, but like other promises of the Lord, its fulfillment is dependent upon adherence to the righteous principles upon which the promise is predicated. It makes no difference how mighty and strong a nation is, how rich in resources or how powerful in military might, if it ceases to have faith in God and fails to govern its people according to principles of righteousness, it faces certain downfall. Nor does our beloved America stand exempt, for the Lord God who brought it into being, and has greatly favored it, decreed that if the American people should forget the Lord and "become ripened in iniquity" they would be swept off. If this should happen, or if subjugation should come to the people of this land, it will come because we in America have reached a fulness of iniquity. It seems reasonable to believe that the fate of a republican form of government is determined by the degree of its adherence to the principles of Christianity, and that governments and people who reject these principles will find themselves slaves to their own evil ways or of some arbitrary power. It is impossible to govern the world successfully without God, for, after all, God governs the world. Justice to man and a settled faith in God should be two of the most outstanding attributes of the statesmen of America. The progress and perpetuity of this great government, and for that matter of any democracy, depends upon the righteous endeavor of its statesmen, as well as its citizens, and their adherence to the religion of the Master. "Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people" (Prov. 14:34). It is encouraging to know that the great majority of the statesmen of America have, in some degree to say the least, acknowledged a faith in God and in righteous living. We can safely say that those who have achieved lasting greatness in America have been God-fearing men who have felt dependent upon an almighty power and who acknowledged that power from time to time. We believe that the Lord prepared for the time when his gospel should be restored in its fulness to Page 75 the earth. We consider that the men in the American Revolution were inspired by the Almighty to throw off the shackles of the mother government. For this purpose Adams, Jefferson, Franklin, Washing: ton, and a host of others were inspired to deeds of resistance and to bringing into existence the Constitution of the United States. To the Latter-day Saints the Constitution is an inspired document, for the Lord has said: For this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose, and redeemed the land by the shedding of blood (Doc. And Cov. 101:80). Statements from these early patriots prove that they were humble men who recognized their dependence upon the goodness of God. Let me list a few: Washington openly acknowledged the hand of Providence in shaping the affairs and destiny of America, for he said: No people can be found to acknowledge and adore the Invisible Hand which conducts the affairs of men more than the people of the United States. Every step by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency. There were many occasions during the Revolutionary War when Washington demonstrated his faith in the guidance and protection of the Supreme Being, and often expressed his belief that "God in His great goodness will direct the course of the conflict." In his first Thanksgiving Proclamation as President of the United States of America, Washington declared: edge the providence of the Almighty God to obey His will, to be grateful for His benefits, and humbly implore His protection and favor. How could a nation go far astray in its policies with a leader who looked to God for wisdom and implored others to do likewise? He felt that the determinations of Providence were always wise whether they appeared to be in his favor or not. When in command of the Virginia Regiment, he gave orders for the officers and men under his command to assemble each Sunday and have prayers and devotion. He maintained that "True religion and morals afford a government its purest support." Elbert Hubbard said of Washington, "His purity of purpose stands unimpeached, his steadfast earnestness and sterling honesty are priceless examples." GENUINE religious feeling was deep in the heart of Benjamin Franklin. He prayed that he might be preserved from atheism, irreverence, ostentations, and hypocrisy. His great desire was to be loyal to "my Prince," that he might remain humble and submissive to the will of the Lord. It was he who calmly arose in the Constitutional Convention after days of discord and little progress and said: Mr. President, I perceive that we are not in condition to pursue this business Our blood is too hot... - the different which, having been formed with the seeds of their own dissolution, now no longer exist. In this situation of this assembly, groping as it were in the dark, to find 16 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—FEBRUARY 1946 political truth, and scarce able to distinguish it when presented to us, how has it happened, Sir, that we have not hitherto once thought of humbly applying to the Father of light to illuminate our understanding? In the beginning of the contest with Great Britain, when we were sensible to danger, we had daily prayer in this room for divine protection. Our prayers, Sir, were heard; and they were graciously answered. To that kind Providence we owe this happy opportunity of consulting, in peace, on the means of establishing our future national felicity; and have we now forgotten that powerful Friend? Or do we imagine that we no longer need His assistance? I have lived, Sir, a long time; and the longer I live the more convincing proofs I see of this truth, that God governs the affairs of men. It is said that after the convention accepted Franklin's suggestion and called upon the Lord for help, distinct progress was made and our magnificent Constitution was the result. There is always hope for progress and safe legislation when our statesmen realize their own limitations and earnestly seek the Lord's help! The religion of Abraham Lincoln was based in both doctrine and practice on the Savior's admonition "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.... And.... Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." He joined no particular church but, nevertheless, he stands before us as one humbly seeking the inspiration, counsel, and help of the Almighty, praying for guidance from above and giving help and sympathy to all about him. He had an unshaken faith in the ultimate success of the right, and in the darkest hours of his days in the White House, he declared that he almost lived on his knees. In reply to an address from the Society of Friends, delivered to him at the White House, September 28, 1862, Lincoln said: I am glad to know I have your sympathy and prayers. In the very responsible position in which I happen to be placed, being a humble instrument in the hands of our Heavenly Father, as I am and as we all are, to work out His great purposes, I have desired that all my works and acts may be according to His will and that it might be so, I have sought His aid. In the life of Woodrow Wilson, religion was so ingrained that there was never speculation, let alone doubt, in regard to Deity. He had an absolutely immovable faith in God. He once declared in public, "I do not understand how any man can approach the discharge of the duties of life without faith in the Lord Jesus Christ." He faithfully observed the Sabbath Day. He knew that the fate and progress of the nation were dependent upon the spir itual integrity of its citizens, for he said, "Our civilization cannot survive materially unless it be redeemed spiritually." Calvin Coolidge states in his autobiography that when the office of President of the United States came to him, following the death of President Harding, he and his wife knelt in prayer before leaving their bedroom where the message was given him, and asked God to "bless the American people and give me the power to serve them." Many times thereafter he approached God in prayer supplicating him for wisdom. Surely here is a mark of greatness. William Jennings Bryan, one of America's distinguished statesmen who swayed audiences with his oratory and who was three times candidate for President, had a most whole some concept of God and a firm belief in the efficacy of prayer. AMERICAN STATESMEN—THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD GOD 71 Said he: The great need of the world today is to get back to God—back to a real belief in a living God—to a belief in God as creator, preserver, and loving Heavenly Father. When one believes in a personal God and considers himself as part of God's plan, he will be anxious to know God's will and to do it, seeking direction through prayer and made obedient through faith... President Harry S. Truman has indicated his need of God's help since he has already called for special days of prayer for victory, thanksgiving and peace, and has asked the people of America to seek divine aid in maintaining the peace. Surely any nation in the hands of statesmen who habitually seek divine guidance is more certain of realizing its rightful destiny than would otherwise be the case. While a religious attitude on the part of an individual does not place him beyond error, it is certain that, with a genuine desire for righteousness, he is a better man and will more likely be a better servant of the people. This belief is sustained in modern revelation where we read: We believe that governments were instituted of God for the benefit of man; and that he holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them, both in making laws and administering them, for the good and safety of society (Doc. And Cov. 134:1).. From the same source we obtain this admonition, "wherefore, honest men and wise men should be sought for diligently, and good men and wise men ye should observe to uphold; otherwise whatsoever is less than these cometh of evil" (Doc. And Cov. 98:10). Indeed, "Righteousness exalteth a nation!" Se comes
