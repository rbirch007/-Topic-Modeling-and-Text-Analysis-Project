Prelude to Christmas Frances C. Yost ING Winter laid his ermine K carpet of snow in readiness for the coming yuletide. Strings of gay, colored lights winked from every shrub and pine. Festive wreaths hung on the doors. Every house on Oak Street seemed ready to greet the eve of Christmas except one. Even inside that house, however, a pudding bubbled on the kitchen coal range, permeating the air with its fragrance and steaming the windows to invisibility. Granny Crockett stood at her worktable, stuffing the last morsel of dressing into the fat rooster, but her heart was heavy. It was mighty hard rearing Mary and Baill, her two grandchildren, in this fast age, when she herself was nearing seventy. It had been a struggle for Granny both financially and physically, since her son Ronald and his wife Vie and two of their children had been killed in an automobile accident. Granny well remembered the day. She had been tending Mary, the tiny baby, for them and Bill, who was eight, had been left with her to help out. That span of eight gapping years between them, had somehow made the job of rearing them even more of a problem, and now Bill was in college, studying law. Granny thought of the problems at hand. Bill had come home from college the week before, but he seemed changed. He never stayed at home. And he hung around Sue Rankin's far too much, Girl friends Page 834 meant added problems, knew only too well. Then, too, there was something wrong with Mary. Granny had given the child every chance to pow out her troubles on Granny's shoulder, but to no avail. A child of twelve should have been bubbling over with the Christmas spirit, but Mary seemed quiet and solemn. "Mary dear, bring Granny a threaded needle to sew up this fowl." Granny's face wrinkled into a smile made of many tiny crow's-feet. Granny "Yes, Granny." Mary's ? face flushed. "Land sakes, child, you don't mind havin' chicken 'stead of turkey this Christmas, do ya?" "Oh, no, Granny. Turkey couldn't be half as good as you cook chicken." "Is it cause of not havin' a tree this year?" "No, Granny, I don't mind going without a tree, honest. We can save that much toward Bill's fare back to school." Mary brought the thread to Granny. She glanced at the clock. It was almost six. She caught a sob before it did any damage. It was hard keeping things from Granny. She was wise as two, maybe three, owls. The clock itself somehow brought back everything to Mary. 'The remembrance of the night Bill had come home from college to spend the holidays moved before her, as a motion picture run too rapidly, and blurred a little. PRELUDE TO CHRISTMAS It had been a Friday evening. Mary had been sitting on her bed counting out her Christmas money. Three dollars and ninety-eight cents altogether. Mary had seen a lovely, lavender, hand-knit shawl of wool, with tiny flowers embroidered on it, and had decided it was the very present for Granny. Mary could imagine her with the shawl wrapped about her shoulders, her eyes shining kind of moist, and her soft gray hair falling in waves over her ears. The shawl had been marked two dollars, and it was a real bargain, So Mary had set aside two dollars in a separate pile, for the shawl. In another store, Mary had seen the cleverest perfume sets. Five tiny bottles, each holding a different scent, dressed like quintuplets. On the lids of each bottle had been painted a face, and each per fume doll had worn a different colored ribbon dress. Marty knew Carma and Reah, her best friends, would simply adore such a gift, so she had set aside another dollar for two sets of perfume. That had left ninety-seven cents for stationery for Bill, and wrapping paper and ribbon. Yes, there would be just enough money, and, as tomorrow was Saturday, she would do her shopping then. Just then a tap had been heard on her door. Mary had quickly gathered up the money, and tucked it in its hiding place, and gone to open the door. "Can I come in, Sis?" almost whispered. "Sure!" Mary had closed the door behind him. Bill was tall and bronzed, a living reminder of the summer that was Bill had 835 past. He had sat on the edge of Mary's bed. "Got any money?" in his cheeks twitched. "M'm-h'm." "Say, Mary, I got roped in on a theater party with Sue and the gang tonight, and I haven't a ted cent." Their eyes had met in the mirror, above Mary's dresser, and Bill had rushed on to explain: "J just can't ask Granny for spending money: Could you make me a loan?" Then he had added coyly, "Mary, old pal." Mary had visualized her money. She could spare maybe a dollar and a half. She guessed she could give Carma and Reah hankies instead of the perfume sets. She could buy cheaper stationery for Bill. But Granny must have that very shawl! Mary had gone to the dresser drawer and fished down under the hankie pile. She had brought out an old watch box and opened jit "How much do you need?" "How much you got?" The muscles M'8* had poured the contents on the dresser scarf. Each coin seemed like an old friend with its own life story. This papet dollar was for cleaning wall paper all day at the Sorenson's one Saturday. The other dollar told about the dirty Parker basement Mary had set in order. Each quarter told of a show she had passed up, and the nickels and dimes were gum and candy Mary had denied herself. "There's three dollars and ninety-eight cents altogether." "I�ll take it all. Thanks, Sis." Bull had gathered up the money m a scoop and put it loose in his pocket. Despair had closed Mary's throat. She just couldn't make her vocal cords explain to Bill that that was her Christmas money, that he just couldn't have all of it! Mary had looked at the calendar. She had been crossing off the days until Christmas. There were just six left! That night, Mary couldn't face Granny the way she felt. Automatically she had brushed her teeth, jerked open the window, and crept shivering between the sheets. "Our Father...." Hours later she had awakened shaking, had sat up in bed and felt the chill of December through her flannel pajamas. She had shaken her brown curls. No? it hadn't been a dream. Bill really had borrowed her Christmas money...! Each afternoon after that, Mary had walked downtown after school to make certain the shawl for Granny hadn't been sold. Once she had almost asked the clerk to put the shawl away for her, but had decided there wasn't any use. She wouldn't be able to earn two dollars before Christmas. OW it was Christmas Eve. Bill had never mentioned the money. Mary wished for the thousandth time that she had told Bill it was Christmas money and had just not let him have it! She found herself almost wishing Bill hadn't even come home for Christmas, just stayed at the school. She could have sent him a present then. Now, who would give Granny a present? Mary knew Bill didn't have anything, because he always showed her his present for Granny. Poor old Granny? she dotes on Christmas so much, thought Marv. If her stocking were empty on Christmas morning... Mary couldn't bear the thought. She hid behind the curtain so Granny wouldn't see, as she dried her moist eyes. Tiny snowflakes, like down feathers, fluttered to the ground, each flake intent on building a fresh white path for Santa's-sleigh before the eventide. Suddenly, Mary noticed Reah and Carma coming up the walk. They were each carrying gifts wrapped in tissue. Mary turned from the window quickly. "Granny, Carma and Reah are coming. Please tell them I'm not home. Please, Granny." Mary started to run up the stairs. "Wait, child. You wouldn't make your old Granny tell a lie would you?" "All night, Granny, but I wish I really wasn't home. I... I wish I were dead!" "There, there, child. Go to the door, and greet your friends with a cheery Christmas wish." Then she thought: When these girls are gone I�ll have a talk with Mary. She's evaded me long enough. That child's in some sort of trouble, and I mean to get to the bottom of it. Mary opened the door as the girls knocked. "Hello, Granny Crockett, and Mary," Carma bubbled, "we brought over a little gift to put under your tree." "Why! Why, we haven't decorated our tree yet," Mary stammered. "Well, we'll just put them here on the table then, for now," Reah smiled. The cutting cold had stung her ears to redness. "I... I haven't wrapped your presents yet, kids. We're late this year."  PRELUDE To CHRISTMAS Mary wore an expression of bewilderment. "Mary, the whole gang is going caroling tonight. They're going to meet at my place about nine o'clock. Please come, your alto is so good," Carma invited. "I'm afraid I can't g0. You see... Granny isn't feeling well." Mary stopped short. Granny had said never to lie, and she seemed to be telling one right after another. Mary felt ill at ease and sighed with relief when her friends finally left. MARY turned to Granny. She could see that she would have to make an explanation of some kind for her actions, She would tell just one more lie. Granny must never know about Bill's having taken the money. Just then the back door opened. It was Bill, for he always entered like a gust of wind. He had Sue Rankin with him. "Hello, Mary and Gran. 'm home." Bill favored them with a grade "A" grin. "Say, Granny, I want to let you in on a secret. Sue's promised to wait for me 'till I get my shingle up. And she even wants to Wear my frat pin 'stead of a sparkler, Imagine that! I brought her over to help decorate this tree. It's the Prettiest one in town." Bill displayed a well-shaped evergreen, its branches shimmering with fresh snowflakes beneath the kitchen light. "Why, hello, Sue," Granny welcomed Bill's friend warmly, Bill pulled out his purse. It was bulging. He started to thing, but Granny, with a wide-eyed on earth did you get that 837 money this time of year, young man?" Granny spoke firmly. It was her job to check up on such things, and she intended to do it even in front of Sue, if necessary, "Why, Granny, I've worked all week at Tyler's, delivering orders," Bill stated proudly. Then, turning to Mary, "Here's five dollars, Mary. A dollar and two cents interest. I'd have paid you back sooner, but they just this minute paid me off." "But Bill... Five dollars!" started to protest. "That's okay, Sis. Banks charge more interest when they don't require security." A hard, painful little kernel in the center of Mary's being seemed to be melting out of existence. At sight of her, Bill's heart was swelled to bursting. He caught Mary in his arms and held her hard. "J thought you knew I'd pay in time for Christmas. Look at the clock. There are still two more hours before the stores close," Maty's face was shining as she looked up. "Granny, may I go down town?" Then in a whisper for Granny's ears alone, "I'm going to buy some mistletoe for Sue and Bill." She hurried for her wraps. "Granny, I think I'll go caroling with the gang before I come home." Granny left Sue and Bill to decorate the tree, Mary manger that first Christmas, many, Many years ago, the making and buying of presents was the prelude to Christmas, Faith Is a Heritage Christie Lund Coles CHAPTER 9 Synopsis: Kid Drage, young, attractive widow of 'Tom Drage, is teaching in the small town where she and her daughter Sharon live in Miss Nobbit's small apartment. Sharon complains of their lack of a home and Enid considers marrying the town banker who has tried to court her. Miss Nobbit dies suddenly and leaves her property to Enid. HOUGH it had been hard, at first, to handle the other woman's things and to live in her house, as the days and weeks passed, Enid found herself singing while she polished windows, furniture, silver, as she added a touch here and there to take the formal coldness from the house and make it more livable. Sharon helped her, touching the things with a little awe, saying, "I wonder where she got this ornate vase?" or, "How long do you suppose she has had these darling cups and saucers?" One day Sharon looked up with lovely, surprised eyes as her mother asked, "Do you know why we are cleaning everything so well?" "Yes. So it will seem more like our Own." "Well, not exactly. I'm going to have a party for you. What kind would you like?" Sharon paused a moment, looked about the large dining room and at the pretty dishes in the china cupboard. "I'd like a dinner party. I've always wanted one. Can we ask some boys, too?" "Don't you think you're a little young?"' Page 838 "Don't say that," Sharon begged, "sixteen is not young any more." "But you're not quite sixteen yet." "Soon will be." "Yes. But you're entitled to be fifteen until your birthday." "T don't want to wait that long." They both laughed, and Enid, graciously, conceded, "All right. There will be boys. Which ones... And what shall we eat?" "The eating will be your department. Which boys... Well, Ray Millersberg for one... Donald Web- @... "You rather like Ray, don't you?" Enid had been wanting to ask that for the past year, ever since she had noticed that he occasionally carried her books home and loitered by the gate. He was a nice boy; he had good, upright parents. She had never broached the subject before, because, somehow, she wanted to put off the day, as long as possible, when Sharon would be going out, would be interested in boys. Yet, she wanted that part of life for her daughter, just as she wanted every normal, good experience for her, every happy, wonderful phase of living. And the unhappy moments, too, if they would make her a better woman, a more understanding and unselfish wife. Sharon had taken her time to answer. Now she said, simply, "Yes. I like Ray. He's simply swell." "Come now, isn't there a better word for it than that? You wouldn't FAITH IS A HERITAGE suppose your mother had ever taught school." "I shouldn't want anyone to suppose it, if it meant I had to talk different from the rest of the crowd." Enid sighed. She hated to preach, though sometimes she wondered about this "crowd" thing. Young people seemed almost to have been turned out in a mold one after another, the same words, the same clothes, the same possessions. She supposed it had been so when she was in school, though it seemed much more evident now with all the "jive" talk, the sloppy joe sweaters, and the saddle oxfords that were imperative to a girl's enjoyment of school. She began carefully, "Why do you suppose it is, honey, that you have to be so much like the crowd?" Sharon answered it simply and quickly. And quite. Satisfactorily, "Why, it's important because then we feel that we belong, that we're not a fifth wheel on the social station wagon." Enid laughed again, using a popular slang term herself as she told her daughter, "You're sharp. And undoubtedly right. It would be too bad if we felt ourselves too let out of the parade. Even so, remember that really fine people have the courage of their convictions, they dare to be different, to grow slowly and surely..." "I know, Mom," Sharon answered. "Now, why don't you rest a few moments and figure out a super menu?" The menu was good, and the dinner a fine success. All the young people seemed to have an amazing amount of fun. She had fun being with them, watching them. When 839 it was time for them to leave, Sharon asked her mother, quietly, "Mom, Ray wants to know if I can go over to Springdale to their prom next week, he wants to know tonight." There had to be a first time, sooner or later. Enid knew her daughter would be sixteen in two weeks. She felt she had done pretty well to keep Sharon home at nights this long, when she saw the twelve and thirteen-year-old girls in their high heels and make-up, going out at nights when they should still be in bed getting long hours of sleep. She gave her consent. Later, she saw the smile on the boy's face as Sharon told him.... She remembered Tom's smile with a sudden, shaking vividness. Quietly, she went to bed. HE night Sharon went to the dance, Enid walked from one empty room to another. The house seemed unearthly quiet, except for the ticking of the grandfather's clock which stood in one corner of the living room. It seemed to be ticking the moments off grudgingly. It seemed to say, "You'll have to get used to this. She'll be gone many nights; you'll be alone. Someday, she'll marry... Then... You... Will... Be... Alone." She tried to read, to embroider, listened to the radio. Yet, in the end, she settled down in a large chair to dream of the past and just wait.. The past seemed so close. Perhaps that was why it was hard to feel she was being an adequate mother... She seemed so young herself. Perhaps people never really felt old within themselves, never thought of themselves as changing much with the passing of time. That seemed proof of the spirit's immortality. She stirred quickly as the clock struck twelve. Sharon had promised to be home at midnight. She wanted her to come, wanted to see her, touch her, help her out of her pretty dress into the clean, soft bed. She would give her some warm milk so she would be certain to relax and sleep, for well she remembered her first dance and how she had re-lived every moment for hours after. But there was no sudden opening of the door, no smiling, radiant girl coming in. The world was still. The clock ticked on. It was twelve-thirty, and when one o'clock came, her anger was replaced by apprehension. Something must have happened, something awful. She was tempted to call the marshal. Yet, she couldn't do that. If anything had happened she would have been notified; practically everyone knew Sharon, knew to whom she belonged. GHE walked out on the front porch, sat down on the railing looking toward the east, waiting. There was nothing to be seen. Then she saw the lights of a car, peering like a cat's eyes through the darkness as it came around the corner. She could hear it was making a strange noise, saw it slow down as it neared her house. She slipped, unseen, into the hall, saying to herself that she wouldn't be the kind of mother who embarrassed her daughter before her friends. She wouldn't make a scene. She wouldn't! Still, as Sharon came through the door, she couldn't help asking sharply, "Where have you been?" Sharon started to speak, then Enid noticed that Ray was with her. His clothes were dusty, there was a smear of grease on his cheek. He said quickly, "I'd like to explain to you, Mrs. Drage. I'm awfully sorry about keeping her out. We left the dance at eleven-thirty and thought we would have plenty of time. Then we had a flat. I didn't have a spare." Sharon spoke now, telling her, "We tried to hail a car and get a lift but we couldn't. Finally, the boys took the tire off and we came in on the nm." She looked so round-eyed and sweet, and the boy looked so frightened and earnest, that Enid wanted to laugh, wanted to tell them of a similar experience she had had when she was young, but she wasn't sure that would be wise, so instead she told them, "Well, let's try to see it doesn't happen again." Ray assured her, "It won't, Mrs. Drage. I promise you." He turned to leave, and she asked quietly, "Wouldn't you like to have a cup of warm milk and a cookie with Sharon?" He flushed, looked at Sharon, "Why, certainly. I'd like it very much." When they had finished their snack in the kitchen and he had left, Sharon, a little disheveled now, and sleepy, went into her mother's arms. "Tt was such fun," she told her, "even the tire. We laughed and laughed... That is, until I began worrying about you." After a moment, she added, wistfully, "My first dance." "The first of many," Enid assured her, "And now into bed with you." (To be concluded )  The Place of Relief Society in the Welfare Plan (Continued from page 817) When he became thirsty from that terrible agony, he asked for a drink and they dipped the sponge in vinegar and thrust it to his lips. They mocked him, they spit upon him, they taunted him. Can you imagine more human suffering than the Master suffered, but he was not thinking of himself in those last hours, for down near the foot of the cross there huddled a little figure, her shawl pulled tightly about her face. Few friends had gathered around, and only one of the disciples, apparently. The Master had been looking down upon that little woman, and I fancy he had reached into her very soul with understanding. If her Son, this one upon the cross, should pass, who was going to care for her; who was going to take care of her and shepherd her against the pitfalls of one as lonely as she would then feel? The Master apparently thought about that, for he said, in one of the closing thoughts of his life: "Woman," as he nodded to her, "behold thy son," meaning John who stood near; and to John he said: "John, behold thy mother." And John knew what he meant, and straightway after the death of Jesus took the mother into his home and cared for her tenderly. If you would give true sympathy, then, let yours be the understanding that looks through the eyes of the sufferers and tries to see their problem from their standpoint. That is the only genuine sympathy that I know, and the only kind that should characterize the work of the Relief Society. I was up at the L. D. S. Hospital some years ago. One of my dearest friends, a man who had grown old in the service, and a grand old patriarch, was lying there with just a few hours to live. Most of the bodily processes that sustained life had ceased to function. His wife was lying down in the southeast part of the city, paralyzed and helpless. Oh, how he would have liked in that moment to have seen his dear companion, but he knew that was impossible because he had had to lift her about, she could not walk, and every move would bring pain to her wracked body. But this little woman down there in her home thought differently. She, too, had that desire, and so she had her children put her in a wheel chair. They put the wheel chair in the back of a truck and they came up to the L. D. S. Hospital and wheeled her up just outside the door where the father was dying. The daughter slipped in and said: "Daddy, would you like to see Mother "Oh, I should say I would, but I know that is not possible. Give her my love." "But, if we should bring Mother to you, would it shock you too much?" He said: "No, I don't think so." "Well, now don't let it surprise you too much, but Mother is outside the door. We will bring her in in a few moments." And so the Mother came in. I stood watching that sacred scene. Keep in mind that he was so near death that he could not move to embrace her, and she, in her paralyzed condition, could not bend over to Page 841 embrace him, nor to caress him. She just sat there and patted his hand as he reached it out toward her, and this is what she said to him: "Daddy, you and I have met a lot of problems in our life, haven't we? We know what it is to go through poverty, don't we, Daddy? We know what it is to go through sickness together, don't we? We know what it is to go through sorrow, don't we; Daddy?" And he said: "Yes, we do." "Well, now, Daddy, we know how to go through this, too, don't we?" He said: "Yes, dear." And she turned to her children and said: "That is all, I am ready to go." Ah, the understanding of that lovely wife. She gave him the kind of comfort that helped him through the portals of death with a peace that only one with such understanding could have given. Do you not see now, you sisters, why it is a great Program that the Lord has established. Which does not put the delicate work of contacting those in distress in the hands of a merely paid professional. Cannot you see why a mother who has reared her family, who has gone through these experiences, who lives neighbors to that mother, cannot you see why the Lord has put it upon the mothers of the Relief Society to visit these homes? Because, next to the Master himself, there are none in his Church who have a more lovely touch, a more complete understanding of the hearts and the lives of these individuals who are so precious in his sight. May the Lord bless you, my dear sisters, to carry on the great work that you have carried on through these years. You are loved as angels of mercy, as true angels of mercy. God give you the strength, the insight, and the determination, and the loyalty. Never let there be spoken in your hearing, without defense, criticism against the bishop, or against the Welfare Program, or against the Authorities of this Church. If there should come some from these whom you are trying to persuade kindly to co-operate with the bishop, in co-operating with the Welfare Program, where a Program has been developed for ten years to make for the security and peace of our people, when you find them in the homes, do not let yours ever be the voice that joins with them in criticism and saying, "Well, there must be some politics in this, or something else." You always say to them, if you are true to your responsibility as the sisters of the Relief Society: "My brother, my sister, if it were not for the fact that the Presidency of this Church knew that the Welfare Program was God inspired, and was for the blessing and benefit of the children of our Heavenly Father, who are members of this Church, we know that never would it have been given to us." If you will take that attitude, I want to tell you that power and strength will come to you, and influence for good that cannot be wielded by any other organization on the face of this earth. God bless you to measure up to your high responsibility and do the things that our Father has assigned to the Relief Society in this Welfare Program, I pray humbly, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, Amen.  (Continued from page 808) do with you if you are guilty of this farreaching offense? What will become of your children? Do you think the Lord will countenance your evil in which so many are made to suffer? Do you think that you can make another covenant when you have not been justified in the breaking of a former covenant, which brought misery to the children God entrusted to your care? Do not be deceived. The Father will not be mocked, nor will he permit us to trample his holy ordinance under our feet at will simply because of some trifling dissatisfaction. There will have to be many adjustments and our plans, if they are not in harmony with the law the Lord has given, will not stand in and after the resurrection. Some of us may find that we have deprived ourselves of these eternal blessings because of our petty and evil actions. Let us beware how we hold the covenants of the Lord, lest we be judged, and. being found guilty, lose the whole. The Lord bless you, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.
