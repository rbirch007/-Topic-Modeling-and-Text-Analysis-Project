NOT COMFORTLESS Beatrice K. Ekman In a manger, on the fragrant hay, She laid her newborn Son, Unmindful that his destined way To Calvary would run. My son was born on a costly bed; I cradled him in down; He lies where crosses mark the dead In the fields of an alien town. She who had wept at Calvary Beheld the risen Lord, And IJ, when heartbreak came to me, Found comfort in his word.  CHRISTMAS CARDS Dorothy J. Roberts Do not say that this is folly, These paper whimsies wreathed with holly. From deep within some dreamer's brain, The minarets arise again; Starlight silvers the arching neck Of a laden camel; here a fleck Of mica glitters on the snow Of some beloved long ago; And here a piquant spotted fawn Is born from a pen to caper on A sapphire hill; and there a sleigh Revives a far-off yesterday; An amber moon pierced by a steeple; The dreamer's land, the dreamer's people!
