Christmas and the True Christian Spirit Elder T. Edgar Lyon HE festive season known as Christmas is more universally celebrated by Christians than any other seasonal _ tradition. Although it is usually thought of as the birthday of the Savior, both historical evidence and modern revelation indicate that Jesus of Nazareth was born in the springtime. In the early centuries, the birth of the Savior was celebrated in various places in January, March, April, and May. Apparently, the celebration of Christ's birth was established on December 25th because of pagan influence. Prior to the Christian era, this day and others, a few days before and after it, had been celebrated by pagan peoples as the feast of the winter solstice or the birthday of Mithras, one of the most popular pagan deities. It appears that Christian leaders finally decided, after attempting to suppress these pagan feasts, without success, to designate December 25th as the birthday of Christ. Many ancient pagan customs, such as the use of holly and mistletoe, the yule log, lighted trees, spiced punches, and fruitcake, were kept as part of the celebration, because they were such powerful social traditions, and the new symbolism gave to them Christian meanings. In America, the celebration of Christmas became further complicated and farther removed from the real spirit of Christianity through the addition of the mystical figure of Saint Nicholas, or Santa Claus, as he has come to be popularly designated. Until less than three centuries ago, there was no relation between Saint Nicholas and Christmas. But, when the Netherlands acquired a colonial foothold in the New World, and sent their colonists to New Amsterdam and the Hudson Valley, these sturdy Dutchmen brought with them the tradition of St. Nicholas. According to their tradition, St. Nicholas was a bishop of Myra (a | city in Asia Minor) who served his flock of Christians early in the fourth century. He had been a man of wealth, and, upon becoming a Christian bishop, had used his means to aid the unfortunate and to make children happy, recalling the saying of Jesus, "of such is the kingdom of heaven." In doing this, he had been attempting to follow the teachings of Jesus and the early Christian leaders, who had stressed service to their fellow men as the greatest manifestation of the love of God that could come into the human soul. In the true Christian spirit of neither seeking nor allowing public acclaim for deeds of charity and love, he swore all his benefactors to secrecy. Following his death, however, many of the people whom he had aided told of his munificence, and his fame spread Page 821 far and wide into Europe, the Near East, and parts of Asia. Popular tradition created of him a supernatural figure who went about once a year, distributing gifts. In America, "St. Nicholas" became corrupted by the Dutch children into "Sinter Klaas," which was soon shortened into "Santa Claus." When the British assumed possession of the colonies of the Netherlands, they attempted to suppress the annual visits of the Saint, because of his Catholic background. The Dutch settlers, however, unwilling to rob their children of the annual festival which meant so much to them, changed the time of the traditional visit of St. Nicholas to coincide with Christmas, and his clothing was changed from the robe of a Catholic bishop to that of a resident of a northern land. In this manner, Santa Claus, as we know the tradition, is a creation that occurred on American soil, having been adapted from an old-world background. ODAY, many young people in America make no distinction between the celebration of Christmas, and the annual visit of Santa Claus. Because of the fact that tangible toys and gifts are found in the wake of his nocturnal visits, Santa Claus, the intruder, is often in their thoughts more than Jesus, whose birthday is being commemorated. Due to the great commercial opportunities which the Santa Claus celebration has created, we feel certain that he is here to stay. We cannot oust the usurper. But there are things that individuals and families within the Church can do to counteract some of the commercial elements of this part of Christmas, and substitute for it a truer Christian spirit that will survive throughout life. Latter-day Saint parents are often heard to complain: "There was not so much commercialism about Christmas when I was young as there is today." This lament is only relatively true. There was a great deal of commercialism a half century or more ago, but two factors made it seem less. One was the fact that people had little money to spend compared to what is available today, and so there was not the production of the vast amount of Christmas goods that we have today. It is true that children received less, but, in proportion to the available money, it was probably about as great as present expenditures. The second factor in the growth of the commercialization of Christmas has been the development of more effective advertising. Formerly a paper was limited in its size because it was hand set and hand printed. Yet a perusal of daily papers of fifty or seventy-five years ago indicates that a good portion of their limited advertising space was occupied with appeals to purchase Christmas gifts and the necessary luxuries for sumptuous Christmas dinners. 'Today, with mechanical typesetters and automatic speed presses, daily papers can be made large enough to carry both advertising and news. Alluring advertisements, impossible before the advent of photoengraving, now urge us to buy gifts for Christmas. The radio carries the appeal into our homes, and lighted window displays, decorated streets, and Christmas carols  broadcasted from Powerful public address system, - create an atmosphere that makes gift buying inevitable. Our increased standard of living and the powerful commercial appeals of today are factors which threaten Latter-day Saints with their greatest challenge to enhance the true significance of Christ's birth as a mortal. We could not change these habits and Practices of the world even if we desired. Although We are aware that December 2 5th is not the true birthday of Jesus, we hardly care to ignore the traditional season when others celebrate the event. What, then, can we do to make Christmas a Christ-centered event and cultivate the spirit of giving which he exemplified, in the midst of a Santa Claus-minded world? OME of the fondest memories of childhood that an adult carries into mature life are the remembrances of Christmas at home and in church. We recall such things as the tension of mystery that was about the house before Christmas, the odors of the holiday foods, the plans for special parties, the anticipation of the surprises that awaited on Christmas morning, and the abundance of wonderful gifts that were received; the beautiful music of the Christmas carols, the cheerfulness of the Christmas tree, with its colored lights; the Preparation of baskets of food or gifts for the less fortunate in the neighborhood; the special Sunday School programs and the singing of the little children; a special Christmas sermon at sacrament meeting, and Prayers of gratitude for the gift of the Christ Child. These are the memories that live on and on in the minds of men and women long after Christmas has ceased to mean Santa Claus and the hurry and worry of shopping. If Christmas is to remain an impressive event in the lives of our children with its Proper religious significance, parents should carry on some of the practices which were a part of their own youthful observances of Christmas. The first thing that they should do js to make up their minds that they will endeavor to live the Principles of the Christian life in the home at all times. Here is an Opportunity to take stock of oneself and to notice the things in one's conduct that are not in accordance with the teachings of Jesus, such as the loss of self-control, Sarcastic comments to other members of the family, unkind deeds, harsh words, dishonest acts, unwillingness to forgive others, deception and hypocrisy, Christmas time offers the Opportunity of T�-examining our souls to see how far we have departed from Christian forms of living. Christmas also presents us with an opportunity of having the family work together as a unit in unselfish service to others, Not only must we learn the theory of Christian service and brotherly love, but we need a laboratory in which to let the theory function, that the ideal of service may be transformed into a habit of conduct that will become a habitual wav of living throughout life. Bible passages concerning the joy of giving, the value of giving as compared with receiving, and the great love that God had for the world which caused him to give his Only Begotten Son to save it, can be used to form the background for this experiment in Christian living. CHRISTMAS AND THE TRUE CHRISTIAN SPIRIT 823  Some project should be selected by the family�one of unselfish giving to less fortunate or to lonely people. One should then see to it that each member of the family is given a responsibility that will require time and sacrifices. Even little tots can be taught unselfish service by such activities. 'The parents should not provide everything, but should see to it that each member of the family supplies something by contributing a good toy, a nearly new doll, or some of his Christmas money. No better method of teaching unselfishness and sympathy for others can be found than such a project. Those who have tried such activities on a family basis bear testimony to its great value and wholesome effect on the outlook of their children. United activities of this type are the finest manifestation of Christian teaching. Throughout this season of the year, great stress should be placed on the spiritual aspect of Christmas. Plans should be made to have the family group read together the inspiring story of the nativity as found in Luke 2:1-20. For very small children, perhaps, a first reading from a Bible storybook would be helpful. In addition, the family could make much of carol singing at such a time. Libraries have many publications containing the story of the composing of famous Christmas carols. Such information makes the singing of a carol more meaningful. The family could plan a home Christmas service, with carols sung, played by instrument, or heard from records. Each child could participate with the story of a carol, and a Bible reading. Here, it is interesting to note that the timeless words and music of our beautiful carols all deal with the advent of Jesus and the joy that the world has found in this event. Youth is a time when ideals are most readily fixed in the mind, an age of spontaneous enthusiasm for things new, a period of simple religious faith and confidence, the most receptive time for teaching those values that should last throughout life, and the period of greatest habit formation. Parents who utilize the teaching possibilities of the Christmas season will accomplish four things: They will impress their children with the needs and values of the true Christian way of life; they will encourage in them habits of unselfish service which will last throughout life; they will instill in their children the spiritual enjoyment of participating in religious services; and last, but by no means least, they will give to their children a rich treasure of memories of true Christmas joy to carry throughout their lives.
