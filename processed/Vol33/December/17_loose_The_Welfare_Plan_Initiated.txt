The Welfare Plan Initiated Elder H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, March 4, 1947 Objective: To show how the Lord is helping his saints to face the problems of our day. INNER spiritual strength comes often through suffering. To be called upon to share enriches the soul. The Lord would have his people experience the joys of the greater love known through service to others. From the very beginning, the restored Church of our day has been forced through persecution and hardship into the close bonds of brotherhood. From the early days of the Church in New York, across the rolling hills of Ohio, on to the level prairies of the Mississippi, and thence to the mountains of the great West, the saints have been forced to share alike in joys and sorrows. Poor in material goods and the promise of great worldly wealth, the pioneers of Utah learned to seek the inner joys of the spirit which God gives to his people. No man can understand these promptings of the heart who has not first complied with the gospel principles. Only these signs shall follow them that believe and enter in at the straight and narrow gate. Quietly, but effectively forward have moved the Lord's people, until today they number their strength by the thousands. Their roots are deep. Winds of Page 844 adversity have only anchored them more firmly, and now, amid the storms that rage at home and abroad, may be seen the wisdom of God in keeping his people one. The world will never fully understand the Church Welfare Plan, which had its beginning in August of 1933, with public announcement by the First Presidency at April conference 1936, until it can more fully accept the Lord's way of caring for those in need: Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world (James 1:27). It is the spiritual value of this present plan that is at the basis of its operation. The passage, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself," remembered most as a New Testament quotation, is God's will as recorded first in the Old Testament (Lev. 19:18). Men must learn these unchanging truths if they would honestly care for their less fortunate brothers. In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the enduring values of the Lord's will have ever been taught. Saints humbly trust in his unfailing promises and strive to receive his word. LESSON DEPARTMENT To them, the heavens are not closed. God still speaks through his properly ordained servants today as of old. 'These facts must be kept in mind if one would truly understand the genius of the present Welfare Plan of the Church. Based, then, upon the will of the Lord, the Latter-day Saints take literally his express will as follows: first, they believe that it is more blessed to give than to receive (Acts 20:35); and second, they have learned his command to labor. From Sinai came the words, "Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work... Thou shalt not steal... Thou shalt not covet..." Ex. 20::9, 15,17). Said President J. Reuben Clark, Jr.: Thus the Divine commands to the Church and the directions of its leaders to the people, require as a fundamental principle of their religion that Church members not in distress shall care for the needy widow and orphan, and for the poor, and that these latter shall not lay their hands on other men's goods, they shall not be greedy or covetous, they shall not be idlers, and the physically fit shall work for what they get. No exception has been made to these commands, and no person has been taken out from under them. The Church vigorously decries idleness. Industry, economy, and thrift are extolled. Deceit, avarice, dishonesty, lying, greed, graft are condemned. Honesty, truthfulness, sobriety, willingness to give, love for fellowmen, sympathy for woe, misery, and want, service to and for others, are urged to the point of command. These are the reasons for setting up the Church Welfare Plan; they are the principles underlying it. We claim no monopoly on the virtues which have made our achievements possible. These virtues have been the common heritage of every pioneer out-thrusting in America. Save perhaps in degree, our experience 845 has been the experience of all the pioneers of Western America. None were subsidized, none had easy money, none either asked for or received, government gratuities. Had they waited for these, indeed had they got them, America would never have been built. Some justify our present economic course by saying, 'times have changed." So they have, but character-building has not. The laws of righteousness and progress are eternal. 'There is no escape from them, either for the individual or for the nation. An uncorrupted citizenry builds a great State; no State ever built an uncorrupted citizenry. No man is politically free who depends upon the State for his sustenance. A planned and subsidized economy beats down initiative, wipes out industry, destroys character, and prostitutes the electorate. I repeat In view of all these considerations, the Church has felt that in setting up its Welfare Plan, it was not only meeting its prescribed duty as a Church to its members, but was performing a duty of patriotism to our country ("Church Welfare Program, A Discussion," by President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., Estes Park, Colorado, June 20, 1939, pp. 5, 6, 7, 8). Over thirteen years have passed since the present Welfare Plan of the Church had its beginning. It was started in 1933, with public announcement by the First Presidency at the general conference, April 1936. 'The worst depression ever to grip the world then threatened to engulf thousands. Sensing the effect this suffering would have, not only upon the physical well-being of the saints, but also what the enslavement of temporary jobs and the dole would bring, the General Authorities of the Church sought the Lord's will as it had been given and envisioned a timely plan that would be "a very present help in trouble" (Psalms 46:1). It seemed then to many who were called to lay in a year's supply of food and clothing that there might be undue alarm for giving such instructions. Quietly, however, the organization of the Priesthood in the wards and stakes was marshalled. The bishop, as father of the ward, called his counselors and clerk and began a closer check up of suffering and unemployed among his families. The ward teachers brought in upon new card forms, information which would help to keep in constant touch with each ward member. Relief Society sisters stimulated again the pioneer virtues of their grandparents, preserved foodstuffs, prepared clothing, and established sewing and cooking centers where larger groups could learn and encourage one another in the arts of industry and thrift. Household budgets were studied and prepared, the fainthearted were given encouragement, despair and distress were turned to hope and faith. From the small towns to the crowded cities, saints, often slow at first to comprehend, finally respond. Ed to the call of the Church. A new security developed. There was strength in unity, and problems which seemed hard in the dark days of want grew less, as members accepted the role of being their brothers' keepers. Today, the objectives of the Church Welfare Plan, as outlined in the L. D. S. Church: Welfare Handbook of Instructions, indicate the wisdom and inspiration which brought this much-needed help to the Church. Truly a people cannot perish with such divine vision: OBJECTIVES: The Church Welfare Plan is a program designed to relieve distress among Church members who may be in need; to strengthen the economic condition of all who participate by utilizing surpluses of time, talents, effort and substance, and to promote the general welfare of the Church members at large. Its detailed objectives include the following: 1. That no member of the Church shall want for sustenance. 2. That needed assistance be rendered in times of sickness, accident, death, or other distress to all for whom the Church is responsible. 3. That whenever and wherever worthy employable members are unable to find gainful employment sufficient for their needs, they shall be provided an opportunity to work on a welfare project. 4. That any person who receives welfare assistance, unless unemployable, shall work in the Program. 5- That benefits received for such work be mainly in terms of welfare produced food and commodities, supplemented by other supplies and cash if necessary, the total amount of which shall be based on the needs of the family unit rather than on a fixed compensation per unit of time. There may be some exceptions to this general rule where specific amounts of cash and commodities are given for service rendered. But even in these cases, where such fixed earnings are not sufficient for the needs of the family they may be supplemented by additional commodities from a bishops' storehouse. 6. That the terms "dole" and "charity," as generally understood, have no place in this program. Worthy members who, through age or other disability, are incapable of working in the Program, and who have no other logical means of support, shall be sustained by their respective Church communities from the resources of the Welfare Plan, not as charity but in recognition of their faithful support and services to the Church. 7. That families that are closely associated as neighbors, or through quorum, ward or other Church organizational activities, be encouraged to form small productive groups for co-operatively helping each other to plant and harvest crops, can, process and store foods, or carry out other projects for their mutual advantage and well-being.  LESSON DEPARTMENT Such activities are to be carried on separate and apart from the bishops' storehouse program in many localities. Welfare central, equipment and supplies are made available to those carrying out of such projects.
SCOPE: The Welfare Plan is Church wide, reaching to every Latter-day Saint ward and branch in the stakes of the Church. In the missions, welfare work is limited to an effort to solve local problems.
PARTICIPANTS may potentially comprise all members of the Church. Those who are in need of sustenance, relief of distress, or rehabilitation may participate on the receiving end, at the same time being expected to contribute their own time, talents and substance toward their own support. Others are urged to participate on the giving end�to give part of their energy, produce or finances to the general pool for the common good. All members have an opportunity to join with their neighbors and associates in carrying on worthwhile projects for their mutual benefit and blessing.
WORKERS may be classified as:
1. Those who, regardless of circumstances, are provided employment on a welfare project and in return have their needs supplied from the bishops' storehouses.
2. Those who donate part of their time and energy towards the production of food and other commodities for the benefit of the program as a whole, but who themselves receive no direct benefit or compensation for such services.
3. Those who are employed on a part or full time basis to be supervisors or key workers.
4. Those who are called to direct the program, whether in general capacities, regional, stake or ward.
FUNCTIONS: In order to reach the objectives of the Welfare Plan with any degree of completeness, there must be a clear conception of the necessary functions of the Welfare organization.
These basic functions are:
1. To determine the needs of the people.
2. To gather needed control commodities and commodity contributions.
3. To render needed assistance and to provide employment through work projects.
4. To manage the storage and distribution of commodities.
5. To meet the physical needs of ward members requiring assistance.
6. To promote Welfare work in Melchizedek and Aaronic Priesthood units.
7. To guide agricultural and other rehabilitation.
8. To provide hospitalization for Church cases. (L. D. S. Church Welfare Handbook of Instructions, pp. 7-10.)
Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion
With the help of the suggested readings given below, have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part of the Doctrine and Covenants to discover wherein we must "give heed unto his word," which has been written for our life in this day.
There are but a few active Church members today who have not, in part at least, learned the workings of the Church Welfare plan either through adolescent lessons, Melchizedek Priesthood quorum instruction on Latter-day Saint Church Welfare, or have had complete or outlining the operation of this plan. A copy of this pamphlet should be at hand during the class discussion of this lesson. For the best discussion of the period let us center upon the spiritual outcomes of this plan as these may be discussed from the questions and readings that follow.
1. Who may fall under the condemnation of the Lord given in the passage? Read Doc. and Cov. 56:16-20.
2. On April 23, 1832, in Independence, Missouri, the Prophet was given a revelation as he sat in council with his brethren. Read what the Lord said on that occasion. (Doc. and Cov. 83:1. What significance has this new interpretation to the old one of "love thy neighbor" as given in this revelation?
3. The Lord would have his people seek the welfare of eternity. This, he said, could not be done with eyes full of greediness. (Doc. and Cov. 68:25-32). Why not? What were his commands concerning the sharing of one's properties? (Read Doc. and Cov. 42:30-31; 104:11-18.)

Visiting Teachers' Messages Our Pioneer Heritage Lesson 6?Self-Reliance President Amy Brown Lyman For Tuesday, March 4, 1947 Objective: 'To show that the pioneers were resourceful, creative, and self-reliant. NE of the distinctive differences between the first settlers of Utah and other early settlers in Western America was that the Latter-day Saint colonizers came from a larger number of different localities than did those of any other group. There were among them representatives from practically every state in the Union, from Canada, and from several European countries. 'Then, too, among the Latter-day Saints there were farmers, tradesmen, factory workers, teachers, physicians, clerks, etc. This variation in background, training, and experience was a great advantage to these colonists as individuals as it was also to the communities as a whole. It resulted in greater vision, a broader viewpoint, and added to their efficiency in planning and in carrying out their plans successfully. It has often been said that necessity is the mother of invention. It might be added that necessity is also the mother of resourcefulness. And it is resourcefulness which enables people to manage well. It helps them to accomplish things. It begets self-reliance. In resourcefulness, creative ability, and_ self-reliance, the pioneers of Utah were masters of the highest order. With wisdom and foresight, Brigham Young had advised those who were planning to emigrate to Utah to bring with them choice seeds, good tools of every description, machinery not only for farming but also for spinning and weaving. All these things stood them in good stead in their efforts at community building. During the first year in Utah, there was great activity in plowing, planting, and in irrigating. The pioneers soon learned that in this desert land irrigation was a necessity. Gristmills and sawmills were soon built. A tannery for making leather for shoes and harnesses had to be constructed. Other industries were gradually established, and fortunately those were found who, because of past experience in mills, shops, factories, and mercantile establishments, were able to carry on the work required. Upon their arrival in the Valley. The pioneers lived in their wagons until they were able to cut and saw and haul logs from the canyons for the building of cabins. Later, for home building, they used adobe or bricks made of clay and dried in the sun. Cobblestones in clay and soft rocks were also used. Old-fashioned fireplaces were installed for heating and cooking. The fuel used was sage and oak brush. A few pieces  , LESSON DEPARTMENT of furniture were brought across the plains, but most of the furniture was made by the pioneers out of native wood. It consisted, in the main, of tables, cupboards, bureaus, beds, and chairs with willow seats. Dirt floors were the rule in the beginning. Later, floors made from logs flattened on one side, and not always too smooth, were used; and, finally, braided rugs and homemade carpets were added.
The attribute of self-reliance is inherent in the gospel of the Master. One should employ all his own inventiveness and exert himself to the utmost before expecting the Lord or anyone else to come to his aid. It would be well for members of the Church in this day to emulate the example of the pioneers in developing and strengthening, in themselves, the power to be found in self-reliance.
