Laying on of Hands for the Gift of the Holy Ghost Elder T. Edgar Lyon For Tuesday, March 18, 1947 LATTER day Saint theology differs greatly from all other Christian interpretations of the Godhead, because of its teaching concerning the personalities that constitute this trinity. In regard to the Holy Ghost, our teaching is different and more positive than others. Most confessing Christians believe that the Holy Ghost is nothing more than a spirit that is part of the Eternal God, radiating from him in much the same way that light and heat are radiated from a central source of supply. Latter-day revelation has given us the true conception. Verses twenty-two and twenty-three of section 130 in the Doctrine and Covenants instruct us as follows: The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us. A man may receive the Holy Ghost, and it may descend upon him and not tarry with him. This scripture teaches specifically that the Holy Ghost is a personage separate from either the Father or the Son, being without a tangible body, yet possessed of individuality and personality, and having the ability to dwell within a mortal soul. However, this indwelling may be either temporary or permanent, according to the worthiness of the person, the needs of the person, or the manner in which it was _bestowed upon him. If bestowed according to the prescribed rules of the Church, the person receives the gift of the Holy Ghost, which should be a lasting, vital part of his life and his faith, The Prophet Joseph Smith explained this in a statement that has become a classic description of the difference between the gift of the Holy Ghost that one receives at confirmation, and the temporary descent that the Holy Ghost may make on special occasions. There is a difference between the Holy Ghost and the gift of the Holy Ghost. Cornelius received the Holy Ghost before he was baptized, which was the convincing power of God unto him of the truth of the Gospel, but he could not receive the gift of the Holy Ghost until after he was baptized. Had he not taken this sign or ordinance upon him, the Holy Ghost which convinced him of the truth of God, would have left him. Until he obeyed these ordinances and received the gift of the Holy Ghost, by the laying on of hands, according to the order of God, he could not have healed the sick or commanded an evil spirit to come out of a man, and it obey him; for the spirits might say unto him, as they did to the sons of Sceva: "Paul we know and Jesus we know, but 856 who are ye?" (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, page 199). It is necessary to distinguish between the Holy Ghost and the divine spirit that is to be found everywhere on earth among mortals of all races, creeds, and colors. President Joseph F. Smith very pointedly explained this difference: It is not the Holy Ghost who in person lighteth every man who is born into the world, but it is the light of Christ, the Spirit of Truth, which proceeds from the source of intelligence, which permeates all nature, which lighteth every man and fills the immensity of space. You may call it the Spirit of God, you may call it the influence of God's intelligence, you may call it the substance of his power, no matter what it is called, it is the spirit of intelligence that permeates the universe and gives to the spirits of men understanding (Gospel Doctrine, pp. 73-74). What then, is the function of the Holy Ghost that is conferred upon us as a gift at the time of confirmation? It gives to those receiving the gift, if they are faithful, the right to the companionship of the Holy Ghost. It is also the completion of the symbolic representation of a rebirth that is part of the acceptance of the gospel of Jesus Christ. When John the Baptist appeared in the towns and villages of Judea, he preached a powerful message of repentance, calling upon the people to straighten out their crooked ways of living and bring forth the fruits of righteous living. Then, when this had been done, he urged them to accept baptism by immersion that symbolized the washing away of sins and the burial of the old, sinful self. John did not end his work with the accomplishment of the ordinance of baptism.He stressed the fact that there must still be a rebirth by the Spirit, to complete the act of regeneration to a new life. He said:. I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you whom ye know not; He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.... The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me. And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.... I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him. And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost (John 1:26-33). The elderly gentleman referred to in lesson five who did not count the first forty-five years of his life, had fully caught the significance of this idea that John was preaching. Jesus told Nicodemus that unless a person were born again "of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" (John 3:5). This idea of the rebirth to a newness of life through water baptism and the reception of the Holy Ghost became the fundamental message of the Christian Church in its public preaching. After having completed a "Bath of Regeneration," as some have called baptism, our elderly friend had had hands laid upon him. The conferring of the Holy Ghost upon him had, in his estimation, completed his rebirth as much as the entrance of his spirit into his body at physical birth had given him mortal existence. Jesus spoke of the Holy Ghost as LESSON DEPARTMENT a "Comforter." On_ several occasions he informed his apostles that, following his departure from them, they should be comforted in his absence by the Spirit that would be sent them from the presence of the Father. As the years passed and these apostles went into the world to proclaim the good tidings of the gospel, they were literally comforted by the Holy Ghost. It gave to them the comforting testimony of the reality of the cause for which they were forced to suffer and endure opposition and hardships (see Acts 2:1-4; I Cor. 2:9-16). Another function of the Holy Ghost is to lead those who receive it in paths of truth. If one lives in accordance with gospel teachings, loves his neighbor, and serves God, the guarantee is given that the Holy Ghost will be a constant companion. If this companionship is enjoyed, truth will always be discernible, and error will have no power over the mind. Evil, which is the embodiment of error, will be shunned, and good will be chosen in its place. The Savior promised his apostles that the Comforter should act as their inspirer, giving to them words to speak as occasion arose, recalling to their memory needful experiences and ideals (John 14:26). He promised it would make them equal to every occasion that might arise. Furthermore, he promised them that it would serve as the spirit of revelation, that they might speak revealed truths and give utterance to prophetic teachings. There remains yet another function of the Holy Ghost. It has the power of aiding in the acquisition of the spiritual gifts of God. We cannot all be apostles or prophets or 857 stake presidents or bishops or hold other offices of trust. But each Latter-day Saint can diligently seek to gain the promised spiritual gifts. Various passages of scripture describe them as the virtues of patience, forgiveness, humility, longsuffering, kindness, meekness, control of the tongue, pure thoughts, courage in the face of trial or disappointment, faith in the gospel and the atonement, chastity, service to fellow men and unselfishness. Without the acquisition of these qualities, the Christian character is deficient. The ordinance by which the Holy Ghost is conferred upon the individual is commonly known as "the laying on of hands," although this procedure is also used for ordinations to the Priesthood, for patriarchal blessings, and when one is set apart for a specific office or calling within the Church. Accompanying the laying on of hands by those authorized to confer the Holy Ghost, the following words are spoken: "In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ receive ye the Holy Ghost." Only those bearing the Melchizedek Priesthood have authority to officiate in the laying on of hands. Scriptural evidence is available, indicating that only such authorized bestowal has been recognized. In Acts 19:1-6, there is an account that is illustrative of this necessary power. Arriving at Ephesus on his missionary travels, the Apostle Paul found a group of about twelve professing Christians, who had ?????undergone some type of baptism. Paul inquired if the Holy Ghost had been conferred upon them, to which they replied that they had never heard that there was such a thing. Paul instructed them more fully, came to the conclusion that their baptism had apparently been performed by someone who was not divinely authorized, and rebaptized them. Then he laid his hands upon them and conferred the Holy Ghost upon them, with miraculous results. The eighth chapter of Acts likewise contains evidence of the practice of the laying on of hands. A sorcerer or magician, having observed Peter and John confer the Holy Ghost through the laying on of hands, offered the apostles a sum of money if they would grant him the gift to lay on hands for the bestowal of the divine power (see Acts 8:9-24). Discussion and Activity Problems 1. Name as many functions as you can that are ascribed to the Holy Ghost. 2. In what sense was the Holy Ghost that fell upon Cornelius and his associates (see Acts 10:34-48) different from the Holy Ghost that was given to you following your baptism? 3. What is the value of the Holy Ghost in our religious thinking and daily living? 4. Have a class member either read or relate the material found in the second chapter of Moroni, concerning the bestowal of the Holy Ghost by the Nephite twelve. 5. In preparation for the discussion period, stress the part that the Holy Ghost should play in the development of Christian conduct. References Smith, Pres.
