HER STAFF Hortense Spencer Anderson The years had brought despair, and vicious sting Of loneliness and want; yet she toiled long For many others, always mastering Herself, and in return her faith grew strong. With service, she had won serenity Like cool, refreshing shade on a summer lake Surrounding her, she the willow tree, Which trembled in the storm, but did not break. And then, as if outraged, in jealous mood, That she should stand with grace and fortitude, The storm redoubled; in fury the lightning flared; And she lay ravaged by grief and pain, ensnared. Grief and pain, because she now was blind. No more could she behold this wonderland, Nor toil for others, seeking through the grind To mend.... What had she left to help her stand? Bereft of sons and home, in woe complete, She asked, "Is there a staff within my scope, Or was it for this chastening defeat Time led me through delusive fields of hope?" She found her staff, made ready, on the shelf Of tested treasures, where it had always lain, Unbroken, guarded still, within herself. Her staff of faith would help her rise again. A Few of Our Gifted Utah Women Artists Alice Merrill Horne Former Member Relief Society General Board PART III Note: Part I of this series appeared in December 1944, and Part II in January 1945 EACH year it has been my cherished privilege to introduce at least two young would-be-artists with a one-man show at Z. C. M. I. The latest addition to the ranks of our artist colony is Maude Maye Nebeker, whose work already reveals strength, courage, and a good selection of subjects. You will like her work. Mrs. Nebeker's husband is the son of my old friend Aquilla Nebeker, the President of the Senate while I served in the Third Legislature as a representative. But once, instead of choosing a young artist, I happened on a lady of dignity and charm who had been painting around for years. 'That is how, at sixty-six years young, Artemesia Redd Romney had her first exhibition at Z. C. M. I. Tiffin Room. Mrs. Romney has mothered ten "GARDENIAS" Bessie Alice Bancroft Page 151 152 children besides looking after many missionary lads. Indeed, she has the ease and grace of the mother of a battalion. Her life story reads like the book of fate. Of late, the whole world has been celebrating V-J Day, August 14. Artemesia Redd first saw the light August 14, 1874. The parents, Lemuel Hardison and Louisa Chamberlain Redd, were pioneers of experience. Louisa was born in Salt Lake City in the early 1849's. Her father, Solomon Chamberlain, was one of the original pioneer company of 1847. The Redd family was called by Brigham Young to establish New Harmony in Washington County in Southern Utah. Lemuel Redd was a sheep rancher. Louisa Redd reared twelve sons and daughters to manhood and womanhood. Artemesia, the eldest daughter, became an expert baby tender. She was habitually creating pictures with any mediums at hand. Even that did not prevent this ambitious girl from helping her mother to reel yarn, card wool, spin, and knit her own stockings. Artemesia went to school until she was thirteen years of age. At this period the family moved to Bluff, San Juan County. Next they moved to Old Mexico when the subject of our sketch drove the team much of the way to Colonia Juarez where the Redd family settled. In Juarez, Artemesia met her future mate, George S. Romney, to whom she was married December 5, 1894. Mr. Romney, a carpenter and builder, had larger ambitions. He was very studious and worked for years taking out his Master's and Doctor's degrees, after the family was driven out of Mexico by the Mexican rebels. Seven children had been born to them in Mexico and three others were added in Los Angeles and Oakley, Idaho. In Salt Lake City, and later in Chicago, Mr. Romney pursued his education. For thirteen years at Cassia Academy, Oakley, Idaho, while her husband served as president, Artemesia studied courses in art. While her husband studied at the University of Chicago, Mrs. Romney painted pictures. Her husband then was chosen head of the Northern States Mission. Responsibility doubled on this, our artist, as she mothered missionaries and supervised thirty Relief Societies. In the midst of this exacting work, her husband passed away. Upon the death of her mate, she plunged into painting for relief and comfort. At Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah, Mrs. Romney studied under B. F. Larsen and Verla Birrell. In Kaysville, she continued under Le Conte Stewart. Finally, she returned to the Art Students' League in Chicago where she prepared to exhibit her water colors. On her return home, at the age of sixty-six, Artemesia Redd Romney saw her work hung at the Z. C. M. I. Tiffin Room in a one-man show. So this intrepid pioneer woman is busy painting exquisite pictures of flowers. BESSIE ALICE BANCROFT, former art instructor at West High School and Horace Mann School, died last May 23d at fifty-eight years of age. UTAH WOMEN ARTISTS "COTTONWOOD CANYON" Maude Maye Nebeker With a powerful mentality, though a weak body, she accomplished very much, seeking to in spite young people to love and understand the beautiful. Each year of her many years of service, Bessie would be found at a university devoting her vacation to study and travel, At the time of her passing she had almost completed her Master's degree.  The school collection at Horace Mann was the first to be established in a Utah junior high school and was eventually named the Bessie Alice Bancroft Collection. Bessie cast her bread upon the waters. May it long continue to return and enrich those in whom she sought to create a love for and understanding of the fine arts.
