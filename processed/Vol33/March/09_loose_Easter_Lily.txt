EASTER LILY Evelyn Fjelsted We stand in breathless awe before The Easter lily now in bloom; In silence it has long designed To glorify our living room. The bulb, so still, a secret held  A secret of a coming dawn, A proof of life renewed where once Another bloom had come and gone. "They toil not, neither do they spin," And yet a king was not arrayed Like one of these whose royalty Presents a roseate parade. Each lily seems to hold a scroll That tells in sweet humility, The story written in a bulb  A treatise on eternity. "CONSIDER THE LILIES" From a Painting by LeJeune A Perry Picture Page 16]
