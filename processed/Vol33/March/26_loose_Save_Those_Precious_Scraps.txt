Save Those Precious Scraps DON'T throw away your tiny print scraps until you have seen this quilt pattern," says Sister Ivie H. Jones, Relief Society President of the Spanish American Mission. "Whether it be called a 'String Quilt Block,' because it uses those long, narrow wedge-like strings from the side of skirt gores, etc., or whether it be called "The Scrap Bag,' "The Four Point Star,' or 'Economy Quilt Block,' it is a very practical way to use those tiny, irregular scraps that are too precious to throw away and yet too small to cut up into other types of quilt blocks. In fact, the smaller and more irregular the scraps, the prettier the finished quilt will be. It really might be called the 'Prism,' for the octagon wheel, made of the print scraps, looks pretty much like a prism of different shapes, sizes, and colors. "Making this quilt is especially suitable as a Relief Society project, since the sisters can work on the blocks at home and be assured that they will all be the same size when finished, and that is quite an item. But it is like seeing the Carlsbad Caverns or the Grand Canyon. No one can properly explain its beauty. You'll just have to see it for yourself." Materials Needed: Sufficient wrapping paper to cut forty squares, 1314x1314". (Newspaper is not satisfactory. ) Two yards plain colored material or two dyed flour sacks. However, the pattern adjusts itself nicely to any material on hand. Two yards will make strips 2" wide. 114 yards makes strips 114" wide, etc. Two feed or flour sacks (or mulsin) for the stars. Scraps of material. Page 212 WORK MEETING PAPER STEP NO. 1 Cut 40 squares of paper 1344" x 131%". Be accurate. This makes a quilt 72 x 90 inches finished. METHOD STEP NO. 2 Fold in half and cut on dotted line. Each triangle is a block. FOLDED MUSLIN STEP NO. 4 Fold muslin or flour sack (for stars) lengthwise. Press exact, fold again making six or eight folds, depending on width of muslin. FOLDED MUSLIN A STEP NO. 5 The width of the folded muslin (a-a) determines the width of the pattern for the star A-A. Use a ruler and mark with pencil A-C, leaving the width of one seam between C-C. STEP NO. 7 Place pattern No. 6 in exact center, mark with pencil. Fold pattern in half, reverse ends and utilize all material No. 7. STEP NO. 3 Fold in half again and crease at dotted line in order to get star in exact center of paper triangle. STEP NO. 6 Star pattern made from Step No. 5. STEP NO. 8 Now tear plain colored material or dyed flour sacks into strips lengthwise. If you have 2 yds. Material, make strips 2 in. Wide.
