Oquirrh Stake Uses Tree Drawing in Magazine Promotion
Work in this stake are to be congratulated on the beautiful way in which they accomplished their subscription programs, and for their devotion and faithfulness in the "follow-up" work which resulted in a most successful completion of the Magazine project. Thee beautifully designed tree, a photograph of which appears on the opposite page, was used by Oquirrh Stake as an aid in achieving its excellent Magazine subscription percentage rate (113%) for 1947. The tree was designed and painted in lovely pastel tints by Sister Hazel B. Jones on a large piece of heavy cardboard, size 27" x 44/7. The graceful proportions and the unusual beauty of the poster were pleasing factors in securing good will for the Magazine and in interesting the members of the wards in the project. The inscription was written by Martha Lamb, Stake Relief Society President.
One week (October 13-18) was designated by the stake for conducting an intensified subscription campaign. For this purpose the five wards were divided into districts and two members of a specially appointed Magazine committee visited each home in the district. Before leaving on their errands the members of the committees met at working sisters' was willingly provided by Relief Society members not serving on the "calling committees," or renewals were not obtained on the first visit, members of the committees made repeat calls until the fine record of 113 per cent had been secured.

"FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ZION AND THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ALL NATIONS"
Lincoln Park: Lincoln Park, in the Northeastern part of Chicago, borders the lake, with many acres and attractive as any the same from whence it originally derived its name. As in other parks, there are rustic seats, shaded by large trees, and the ground is everywhere carpeted with beautiful lawns and flower beds, interspersed with artificial ponds and channels, for the convenience of boaters. But its chief attractions are those of its hot house and its extensive exhibition of wild animals.

In the hot house can be found innumerable tropical plants and flowers, so arranged, according to class and form, as to produce at the same time the most pleasing and instructive appearance.

THOUGHTS OF LIFE AND NATURE

Why do the apple-blossoms,  
On a bright spring day, so quickly fall?  
Only come to show their beauty,  
Then with the breezes fall?

Because Dame Nature calls them  
To the earth's untidy floor.  
For they've lived their time appointed,  
And their blooming time is o'er.

BEAR LAKE STAKE: The Relief Society of the Bear Lake Stake held their Twentieth Semi-annual Conference at St. Charles, July 7th and 8th, 1888, Pres. Julia B. Lindsay presiding. The presidents of the different branches of the Society gave in their verbal reports, which were favorable. Coun. E. Callings made a few remarks, in which she plainly set forth some of the duties pertaining to the Latter-day Saints, and showed the good results of obedience to God's laws.

NOTES AND NEWS: There are four Siamese babies studying in England.
Princess Eugenie of Sweden has sacrificed her family jewels to build a hospital for cripples upon an island off the coast.
The Directors of the Western Pennsylvania Medical College in Pittsburgh, Pa., have declared against the admission of women as students, and refused the applications of six young women.

SOME SERIOUS REFLECTIONS: The true Latter-day Saint will be measurably prepared for whatever may transpire. The great and mighty revolutions, and the distress of the nations at the present time, are things that we have been looking for. We must be of good cheer, keep the commandments of God, and be sure to have the Spirit as our hand to act a double watch over ourselves, that we do not grieve and lose the Holy Spirit, and drift away into unbelief, but prepare ourselves for what is lying before us, which are days of tribulation, and try to avoid that awful whirlpool into which so many have been led, either by a spirit of doubt and unbelief, or because of transgression, and have sunk to rise no more. Those who bear these things in mind, and are watching the signs of the times will be able to discern between truth and error, and accept their trials as needful lessons, that will add to their store of experience, which in a future day will be of great worth.

WOMAN'S SPHERE Ramona W. Cannon

THE originator, in America, of poster-preaching to non-churchgoers is a young Baptist girl, Jo Peterson, who began her campaign eleven years ago in Chicago. She now supervises the monthly distribution of Bible quotations on 40,000 billboard posters, small memory cards, or placards for trains, buses, or streetcars. These go to thirty-seven countries. Some have reached Japan and Germany.

CENSUS officials believe that by 1950 there will be sixty per cent more women between the ages of forty-five and sixty-four employed than there were in 1940—an increase of one and one-half million.

THE annual Girls' State and Girls' Nation activities sponsored by the American Legion Auxiliary give excellent training in democratic government to the young women of America. Intelligent leadership will no doubt result from this enterprise.

THE average life-span of women in the United States at present is 69.5 years.

MRS. EDWIN J. DRYER JR. (Dorothea M.) is a deputy county attorney in Salt Lake, the first woman to hold this position.

TWELVE women dentists, from the Western States and Canada, most of them wives and mothers, attended the convention of Western Dentists, held recently in Salt Lake City. Most unusual profession is that of Mrs. Ellen Ferguson of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who makes ceramic skulls which are exact duplicates of human skulls. They are used by medical students and artists.

[N Shanghai, China, is a bank staffed entirely by women, and said to be the only women's bank in the world. The first depositors were women, though men have now joined the ranks. As low a deposit as ten cents is accepted.

[N a survey of women and men students at Mount Union College, Ohio, the question was asked: Have modern conveniences made it possible for the average woman to bear and rear children and maintain a home properly and at the same time carry on a career in business? Eighty-four per cent of the students said "No." Yet recent statistics show that one out of every ten married women in America is gainfully employed. Does this represent the difference between ideals and practical necessity?

Editorial Vol. 35 October 1948 No. 10 The Meaning of October

AGAIN the autumn season comes with its rich harvest and its tide of red and yellow leaves. The mother in the home is busy with fall sewing, with canning and storage of fruits and vegetables, with making plans for the winter comfort and welfare of her family.

The leisurely and quiet way that autumn comes to the earth is sometimes not reflected in the strenuous days of the homemaker.

Yet there is much of steadfast joy that autumn brings in the return of many of our choicest privileges and responsibilities. To the loyal Relief Society member October brings the inspiration of the regular meetings which give her life inspiration, spiritual strength, and a deep sense of the blessed continuity of that which is precious and worthwhile—the lasting treasures that may be found and retained even in this troubled world.

We return to the sanctuary of the Relief Society room which has meant so much to us; we go back to the joyful privilege of meeting again with women who are united in belief and in purpose. We feel again that comforting sense of belonging, of being active units in a great and growing society—an organization hallowed by more than a century of sisterhood and accomplishment under prophetic direction.

It is our pleasure and our responsibility to lift our hearts and use our hands to build usefulness and spiritual beauty, to join with our sisters in many lands to fulfill the purposes of Relief Society.

By regular attendance at all the meetings we enjoy a continuity of interest and an active participation in a varied program designed to enrich our lives and broaden and beautify our personalities. Sometimes it is not alone the activities which we most enjoy that are most necessary to our development. That we may be truly nourished spiritually, aesthetically, socially, and constructively, we need the well-planned enrichment of all phases of Relief Society work. We need the contributions in words and deeds which our sisters give to us willingly and they need the insight and sympathy which we may have to offer.

The societies which include among the membership older women, and the young mothers, as well, can best achieve the objectives of the organization in group accomplishments and individual growth. Thus the "give-and-take" develops most beautifully in a steadfast circle of united sisterhood.

October is the time for making our plans for the Relief Society year, for beginning our attendance at meetings, and for joining with our many sisters in the privileges and responsibilities of our great organization.

C. The Russells Did Not Go to Church

CHAPTER 3

Edith Russell

ENGLAND is so rarely prodigal of sunshine, I remember that beautiful morning as though it belonged only to yesterday. The sun spilled gold on the dusty windows of the ugly office building to which I daily turned my steps, and a great armada of white clouds sailed before a stiff breeze blowing in from the North Sea. I had no premonition of what the day might hold, beyond the usual galaxy of accounts, ledgers, the bevy of tired, middle-aged women making their contribution to the war effort, and another evening at home, reading before the fire while my mother knitted and waited expectantly for Antony's step on the path. At the office I took off my coat and prepared for the day.

The sunshine lighted up the faces of my "school" of women; there were some eager and animated, others who were anxious and old. I knew how it felt when letters from the front were delayed. As I smiled and said "Good morning," the door of the classroom opened to admit the elderly person of the office manager followed by a younger and vigorous man in his late twenties.

"Good morning, Miss Russell," the manager said. "Please to meet Mr. Gregory Miner, late of the King's Own Royal Rifles. I wish you would be good enough to give him some insight as to the function of your school. He is to learn the business and will need to know."

Mr. Miner bowed. He was possessed of a fine healthy color, a somewhat stocky physique, and he exuded an atmosphere of fastidious cleanliness. I liked him at once, and as soon as the manager had retired, I gave him into the charge of a nice homely matron, at whose desk I could conveniently observe and instruct him.

I was near enough to see that on his left hand he wore a most peculiar ring—a great silver Indian head—a rather vulgar trinket, I thought, on the person of an Englishman. It flashed in the sunlight and I wondered why he wore it and from where it came. It seemed a trifle incongruous compared to the quiet conservative quality of the rest of his appearance.

A little before lunch I approached his desk to inquire after his progress.

"The ring flashed silver in the morning sun, and, smiling, he covered it with his hand. I smiled, too.

"What an unusual ring!" I remarked, and he lifted it for my examination.

"But here is one even more unusual," he volunteered, and from his pocket he withdrew a dull gold object, shaped like a shield and covered with peculiar hieroglyphics I could not understand. It was not vulgar like the Indian head, but apparently this was not valued for its ornamentation, but for something deeper and more significant.

"This ring," said Gregory Miner, "I won for achieving."

"Indeed?" I replied, "What exactly do you mean—achieving? Achieving what?"

REGORY Miner seemed to inhale a deep breath. "Miss Russell," he said, and his eyes looked directly into mine, "what do you think of a Church which has for one of its maxims, 'The glory of God is intelligence?'"

The room, filled with thirty women industriously engaged with accounts and figures, endured one of its rare moments of silence. I could hear the old office clock ticking on the wall and for some reason I thought of time and its relation to eternity. I had a momentary and entirely incomprehensible vision of the vicarage at St. Matthews and a woman called Hannah Shuttleworth with her illegitimate child, then a peculiar sensation of warmth suffused my whole being, the same one feels on beholding an old and intimate friend with a familiar greeting on his lips.

I gave Gregory Miner look for look.

"I knew I wasn't wrong," he said, and my heart gave a great bound as though for a moment it had almost ceased to beat for fear I should give any other answer but this. Gregory Miner smiled, too, also with relief.

"I knew I wasn't wrong," he said. "What Church is this to which you refer?"

I wanted to know. "The Church of Jesus Christ of No? You have Well, then the He Latter-day Saints. Not heard of it? Mormon Church, perhaps?" regarded me quizzically.

I believe I made a reply, but actually I was no longer in that dusty office schoolroom. I was six years removed, watching Michael, my brother, waiting for him to pick up a book my mother had forbidden; a book in which were lurid tales about a strange people called Mormons.

That evening I was home late for dinner. The hungry Antony whooped for joy when I entered the cottage, but my mother was concerned lest my delay had been occasioned by anything disastrous.

"Of course not, darling," I reassured her, as we sat down. "As a matter of fact—"

I was magnificently offhand—

"As a matter of fact, I have been talking to a Mormon in town."

"You have been—what?" Horror expressed itself in every line of my mother's features.

Antony helped himself to more vegetables and inquired: "You mean he was in a circus, or something?"

I could feel my mother's eyes fixed upon me, but I avoided them and waived Antony's question.

"He is a very charming fellow, Mother," I said anxiously. "I feel sure he is perfectly respectable. He is being taught the business at the office. And he—he has only one wife."

I was concentrating upon the food on my plate. I heard my mother say in a cold, shocked voice: "How do you know?"

I took a deep breath.

"Because I asked him," I said, and my face burned at the memory. I was dreadfully conscious—that somewhere in this innocent conversation THE RUSSELLS DID NOT GO TO CHURCH lay an issue so great I was afraid even to contemplate it.

I lifted my eyes to meet those of my mother.

A "Perhaps Antony will bring in the dessert," she said, "I think we have all had enough of _ this course."

Miserably, I looked at her face. How I hated to feel her disapproval. Why did I not simply laugh and tell her that if I met a thousand Mormons, it was a matter of no consequence? Why? Why? Why?

THE NEXT few weeks passed in a strange atmosphere of discovery. The young Mr. Miner was an assiduous missionary. Every day brought new explorations into the strange new world of religion. There were obstacles, of course, mental and aesthetic obstacles; a Prophet who was an American; who spoke in the same idiom as that of the cinema, and other facts at first disconcerting to me.

And, always, on the face of the

I told her, one evening, that I would be baptized. She said nothing at first, think you might—come to 'the Church and see me—see me baptized?"

Her look froze me.

Come to see you baptized," she said with such "I didn't do want 673 I will have no part in it.

Ever since I am ashamed of you now. I don't wish to refer to the matter again, have written to Michael as I feel he should know." I went out and walked through the village, up the hill towards beautiful old St. Matthews. It lay there, the Gothic beauty church struck me afresh, seemed to address itself to me in a poignant appeal. But it isn't any use, I gave answer. You only have a part of the truth. I love—and always shall—your turrets and your bells, and your windows—but I can't feed the soul of me on these alone. That's why I'm leaving you—for something whole and complete. I came to you, once, looking for God—remember? I found him—in part. But I'm greedy. A part isn't enough. So—I'm following my Star... 0

A week later, the day of my baptism dawned. I was to be baptized in the afternoon at three, and in the morning, at the office, Mr. Miner asked me concerning my mother. "She will be in church to see you baptized," he assured me, confidently. I laughed, derisively. He didn't know my mother. He didn't know that the Russells did not go to church. He had no conception of the extent of my disloyalty.

674

Luncheon, at home, that day, was an awkward session. Excitement had taken away my appetite, but I strove to eat so as not to irritate my mother further. Antony, intrigued by thoughts of someone having the temerity to "duck" his sister, asked embarrassing questions throughout the meal. But at last it was over. I escaped to my room and put the few things I should need into my bag. I could hear my mother dressing in her room. "I'm going, Mother!" I called. "Goodbye!" Her voice, a little strained and unfamiliar, came back to me. "Wait for me! I'm going into the city, too. We may as well go together." She appeared a moment later, and without further conversation, we went out into the street where the bus was waiting. The vehicle was very full and, though we sat together, we did not talk. My thoughts were filled with the wonder of what was going to happen to me. A part of me ached for the sweet woman beside me, but withal, I was gloriously happy.

As the Church came into view, I rose to my feet and turned to my mother. "Goodbye, darling..." She, too, was on her feet. '"Mumsie, where�?" "Hurry," she said. Stopping." A moment later, we stood together on the pavement—a pavement suddenly paved with gold. The bus swung away, Citywards. '"Mumsie—where are you going?" Incredulity was in my voice. A sob, too, I couldn't help it. I didn't care. "Going?" Incredulity was in my mother's voice, too. "Why? I'm going to Church!" Bless her dear heart, she was as surprised as I was! "But�" I was staring, dumfounded. "I know—the Russells." My mother actually laughed and the sound rang in my heart like a peal of bells. She slipped the little bag I carried from my grasp. In it lay a precious white gown and a missionary's copy of the Book of Mormon. "We'd better hurry," she said. "or we're going to be late." "The bus is ���"

CYCLE

Grace M. Candland

The year is growing old;
The hazy autumn sky
Is pathway for the flight
Of geese and blue winged teals' departing cry.

They seek a warmer clime,
Each from his tattered nest
Down in the icy marsh
And reeds along the lake
At winter rest.

And we who watch them go
On strong and steady wing
Will hear their eerie call
From dim horizons break
In early spring.

FEW THINGS ARE CONSTANT

Mabel Jones Gabbott

The late rose petals, curled along the edge,
Are brown and fallen, like sweet, fragrant rain;
Where once we walked beside the garden hedge
Only thorns and brittle stalks remain.
The wind laughs in the locust tree and shakes
The crescent pods of seeds, sunburnt and dry;
The limbs are bare; no more the green leaf makes
Its lacy pattern on the summer sky.

And now along the river where we walk
The star-shaped snowflakes fall and instantly
Are melted; whirled by water, reed, and rock,
Are lost forever, running to the sea.
Few things on earth are constant; beauty dies,
But love like ours will live beyond these skies.

MIGRANTS

Marvin Jones

Wild white days and snow geese flying,
Quivering lines of phantoms crying;
Bronze October—migrant weather—
Birds are wind, snow is a feather.
Wind and geese sing to a rover,
Pagans calling, wheeling over—
Go my heart and still your crying,
Go where winds and geese are flying....

OTHERS MAY LAMENT

Dorothy J. Roberts

No death is here though leaves of autumn drift
Earthward through the leaning aisles of light.
Some unseen element with wings will lift
Their weightless beauty with unfailing might.
Others may lament that autumn dies,
Seeing summer tarnish on a path of stone,
But something in my heart turns Easter wise,
Knowing earth can merely claim her own.

When cold breath from the canyon's mouth is starting
And maples torch the senses with their cry,
Death is not here, but only nature parting
The summer union of the earth and sky.

Questing Lights

Bell Watson Anderson

Chapter 7 Synopsis: Andrew Rumgay leaves his mother and his fiancée Jane Allison in Scotland and joins his friend Hugh Shand to emigrate to America. They meet Mother MacKinlay' and her son Bob, whom they had known while doing missionary work, and become acquainted with Kathleen Coleman and her friend Margaret Purvis. Hugh and Kathleen are married on board the ship. While in Iowa preparing for the handcart journey across the plains, Margaret tells Mother Mac that she is in love with Andrew, and Kathleen tells the two women that she is expecting a baby. While crossing the plains, Andrew is lost in a blizzard and is rescued by Margaret. She later leaves the Macs and goes to live in Tooele. The others later arrive in Zion. Kathleen and Hugh have a son and name him Mac Coleman Shand. Andrew farms and saves money to bring his family from Scotland. When he finally sends it, he receives news that Jane has married someone else. Andrew is a grieved and lonely man and he sends for his small brother and sister instead.

FROM the very first day Andrew went to see the Hunters, he had been interested in wool—it may have been because his mother worked in it at home. When the snow was too deep for timbering he spent his time, after the chores were all completed, carding wool. Sister Hunter made the soap for washing the wool, soaked it in many waters in a vat especially made for that purpose, washed it, rinsed it, and put it out in the shade to dry. After picking and carding the soft white wool into batts for quilts, or spinning it into yarn, she knit the family's underwear, socks, and stockings. Sometimes she dyed the wool into beautiful colors and knit sweaters and fascinators for her daughters and soft warm shawls for herself and friends.

Page 676

With the waste she made rugs for the floor. Many people wanted her to process their wool but she never found time, so Andrew decided wool-processing would be a good business for him. He built a lean-to on the cabin and went to work. He had woven too many dreams into the river bottoms and the forest—dreams which would never be fulfilled—to return to them. Processing wool would be advantageous for a number of reasons. He would be at home to take care of the bairns—his brother and sister—when they arrived. He could catch up with his Church work. He was making up for lost time now.

When there was no special activity planned in the ward, he went out to visit the sick, to encourage and help the poor, and to teach the gospel. He had wanted to build a fence around his lot with the logs which he had cut when he was timbering, but he hadn't found time. Now he decided to finish up a lot of odd jobs around his home.

The bairns came that fall in time for school. They brought love and comfort to their brother's heart, and sunshine to the cabin. He desired his training to be just as profitable to them as had been his mother's love, patience, and sacrifice to him. She had been father and mother to ten, so he felt that surely he could take care of two.

All preparations for the winter were completed. The shelves and root cellar were full of food. His yard was stacked high with good wood to burn. He called on him for a few days at the mill; was asked to go out and talk to the people about buying stock in the factory company. Plans were made to organize a Co-Operative Store in Resplendence.

As Brother Rumgay's responsibility in the bishopric was to look after the young people, he didn't settle long in any one place. Thanksgiving was the end of all winter activities in—people entertained themselves at the meetinghouse. They had programs of various kinds, operas, home dramatics, and dances. Often there were sleigh-riding parties; their favorite entertainment was the supper dance. They would all gather at some home for a hot cooked supper; then they would go to the meetinghouse for a program and dance.

At holiday time they decorated the ward house and planned entertainment for every night in the week between Christmas and New Year's. Mother invited all the Macs to spend the day with her. After dinner, they had a sacred program, in keeping with the occasion. Mother read the Christmas story from the Bible; Hugh led in singing Christmas carols; Brother Coleman played classical music on his violin; the bairns gave a dialogue.

Bob presented a short talk on gifts: "I'm going to tell you how the MacKinlays received their greatest gift of all. My father was the only one in several generations who did not join the dominant church of Scotland. He wanted to wait and join the true Church. One day, father was walking down the streets of Cowdenbeath. A gentle breeze was blowing. It blew a piece of white paper right into father's path. It fell at his feet. He picked it up and read the announcement of a Mormon meeting to be held in Cowdenbeath.

Father attended the meeting and knew from the first the young missionaries were preaching the truth. He studied their literature and prayed to his Heavenly Father and received a strong testimony. He applied for baptism, and soon mother joined him. This is how we received our very greatest gift. It was a wonderful Christmas. New Year's was the day the Scots celebrated in the old country.

Andrew had suffered a lot of bad luck the past year, and Mother was eager to help a wee trifle to bring good luck to him in the new year. She got Bob out of his bed early, and dressed up in Sunday clothes and new shoes, she sent him along to Andrew's with a basket filled to the brim with every good thing to eat.

Andrew insisted on Bob's coming in and eating a bite of breakfast, then he sent Bob back to his mother's with the basket filled to the brim again. No bad luck would visit the Rumgays and MacKinlays—Bob had taken care of that. A dark-complexioned boy—with guid clothes and new shoes, carrying something filled to the brim—brought good luck. Mother felt just a wee bit easier when she thought of Andrew's situation.

Spring came early. The women were doing their housecleaning and their sewing; the men building and repairing fences. The wool business was successful. Andrew, with the help of his brother and sister, Bill and Janet, had more work than they could do. One evening in April all the Macs dropped by Andrew's house for a little visit.

As they were finishing supper, a knock came on the door. Bill answered. It was the bishop, his second counselor, and the ward clerk—Andrew's fellow workers, calling. They talked about the crops and the weather. Then Andrew asked them why they were calling, as only the night before they had met in bishop's meeting.

Andrew was a little curious and a little anxious. He wondered if they intended to release him. The bishop paused thoughtfully for a few moments, then explained, "Brother Rumgay, we are calling you on a mission to Scotland, if it can be arranged. The ward has some missionary funds you would be welcome to use."

"A mission!" Mother exclaimed, "surely, Bishop, you do not joke about such sacred matters." "We are not joking. We were never more serious in our lives. Well, Brother Rumgay, what have you to say?" "A mission!" Andrew spoke slowly, weighing every word. "I hadn't thought about it, but it's what I do want more than anything else in the world. I found something on the plains, something priceless. I would like to share it with my loved ones and friends."

"We thought as much," returned the bishop. "Now we will leave you to do your planning. It can be worked out."

The Macs were dumfounded. "And Andrew just after telling us he never wanted to cross the plains again," Brother Coleman laughingly expressed himself.

"And the bairns just arrived," Mother added. "Andrew must go on his mission. But how?" the Macs questioned.

Bill and Janet complicated the picture. Their brother wanted them to stay at home and not add more responsibility for Kathleen and Mother. He did not want to take them back to Scotland as they loved the new country and were doing so well in school. Mother studied a long time, and then thought she had the solution.

"Maybe it will work out," she said, "maybe it won't—if it does, it is the one way out and the only way that I can see."

"Don't keep us in suspense, Mother," Andrew anxiously pleaded.

Mother looked around at all her companions. Strange that not one of them had thought about the missing member of the Macs.

"Why Margaret, to be sure. Don't tell me you've all forgotten her." "Margaret," slowly Kathleen spoke. "That's the most beautiful name and the most beautiful person I have ever known. Oh! I'm getting so lonesome to see her." "That's it," Andrew spoke up quickly, "Margaret is maybe just as lonesome for Kathleen and Mother. If she is, she will come."

QUESTING LIGHTS ARGARET was very anxious to see the Macs again. The Stuarts had made her as welcome as one of their own, yet the years had been long and very trying since she parted with the Macs on the plains. She had tried to convince herself that work was the solution to all her problems. If she worked hard enough, eventually it would blot out and she would become interested in new people and new places. She knew now this wasn't true. Her anticipation of meeting the Macs thrilled her as nothing had done since she left them.

Mother and Bob went to Tooele to bring Margaret to Resplendence. The day she arrived had been set apart for celebrating. Mother had insisted on them killing all the pullets, because, after all, she might not be able to buy cayenne pepper. Andrew's missionary party was to be held at the meetinghouse that night.

Margaret helped Kathleen cook the supper, setting the table with Mother's best dishes. She wore a pale blue dress with a fitted basque, full sleeves, and a long billowy skirt. The basque had a curved neckline and a vestee of fine, cream-colored lace. Her long black hair was plaited and wrapped around her head. She wore her mother's cameo, gold and black earrings, and lovely flowers in her hair.

Mother Mac's description of her was perfect—slim and trim. The door opened and Andrew walked in. "Margaret, let me look at you, young lady! Why, you're beautiful! Twice as beautiful as you were when you left us on the Plains. You're good, too! Thanks 679 for 'making my mission possible,' I am sure the Lord will know it is your contribution as well as mine," Andrew spoke from a full heart.

"I wanted you to go on your mission, Andrew. It is your opportunity to offer our kinsmen the gospel, with the wonderful blessings we have all received," Margaret spoke quietly. "It took a lot of faith and courage to accept a mission when I had a young brother and sister to take care of, but the bishop said it could be arranged, and now it is. The bairns are going to love you, Margaret! I hope you can learn to love them."

"I'm sure I can," she said. "Leave it to us and the Lord." "Oh, Margaret, you are wonderful!" Hugh called on Andrew regarding a detail of the program for his farewell party. While they talked, Margaret sat beside Mother Mac and covertly studied the face of Andrew. He had not been well when she left him on the plains, but she was hardly prepared for what she saw in him tonight.

A spirit of righteous indignation rose in her heart against Jane Allison. Andrew was pale and nervous, yet she was sure the Macs hadn't noticed it because he had managed every day to do his full share of all the work. Margaret believed that God had called Andrew on this mission, and she decided that there would be no home worries for the young man while he was away. She would take care of that.

Margaret bowed her head and silently prayed that Andrew would be brought safely back to her.

She remembered the tree in tears on the plains and wiped her eyes.
They all had a wonderful time at the party which was planned like the Scotch entertainment on shipboard. Janet and Bill danced the "Highland Fling" and "Sword Dance."
Andrew was different tonight—very different. He was happy, more like his old self than he had been in months. His friends thought it was the mission. He had the Macs wondering.
The bishop was anxious for Andrew to get started on his way to Scotland. It had been a long time since a missionary had left Resplendence, but Andrew waited while the bairns became acquainted with Margaret (because she wanted it that way), and Margaret became acquainted with the wool.
But before many months the young man was calling for his mail at King's Kettle.

WALK WITH ME
Evelyn Fjeldsted

I am going for a walk today; Will you come along with me?  
To follow trails through pasture lands And rest beside the old pine tree;  
Out where wild rose seed pods shine Like rubies in the sun's blue light—  
Where limpid streams move listlessly And blackbirds whir in sudden flight;  
Where burnished sheaves from stacks that rise Like heaps of gold—a priceless yield?  
Let us lose our cares, just for today And glean the beauty of the field.

AUTUMN NIGHT
Marijane Morris

Tonight there is a shadow stealth  
Upon the huddled harvest fields.  
The corn leaves fall again tonight With waiting, silent fodder shields.  
Above discordant, honking geese, The moon is gowned in garnered gold.  
She floats beyond the windmill's vanes, The clutch both firm and deathly cold.  
Tonight there is a death abroad, A crackling, necromantic time,  
While harvest golds and crimsons die A startled death too soon . . . too soon.

Who does this bloom of summer go When autumn leaves dance in the air?  
Does earth take back what she has borne To gladden hearts some otherwhere?
