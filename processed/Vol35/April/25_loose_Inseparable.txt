THEVOL. 35, NO. 4 APRIL 1948 FOR LONG REMEMBERING Berta H. Christensen The moon is white above Gethsemane, The shadowed night is radiant as the day, For he is risen and at last is free Of earth—free of the tomb wherein he lay. I bore my Son to live. In days to come— When they who sought to snare him as a bird Are one with dust, and nothing but the sum Of their deceit remains—his every word, Treasured for long remembering, shall be As living water never found before. And even they beyond the barrier sea Who are athirst and drink, shall thirst no more. But they shall find his word a sign to tell Which way the shining road to Sychar's well. The Cover: "Spring Blossoms" by Hal Rumel.
