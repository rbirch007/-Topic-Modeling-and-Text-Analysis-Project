Relief Society Building News
WITH the passing of June, there remains only the last quarter of the year which was set aside for the collection of the money for the erection of the Relief Society Building. In order for the books to be balanced in time for the general Relief Society conference, September 29 and 30, it is necessary for the final report accompanied by remittances to reach the general board by September 10. The year October 1947 to October 1948 will be marked as the time that the women of the Church, supported by the brethren, gathered the funds for an undertaking of which the sisters of the Church had dreamed since the days of Nauvoo.
As these last months pass, it is the earnest hope of the general board to find the name of every Relief Society member in the stakes and in as many of the missions as possible enrolled as a contributor. The names of many of the brethren will likewise be found as donors of Special and Memorial Gifts. The names of persons memorialized will also be entered upon the rolls to be placed in the cornerstone and preserved in the records of the general board. After the conclusion of the fund-raising period in October, special sheets will be sent to stakes and missions on which to list the names of contributors therefore no lists of names should be sent in before that time.
Serious reflection on the work the women of the Church have accomplished and the greatness of this present undertaking, brings forth many expressions of gratitude for the opportunity given to donate to this cause.
The following letter from Juarez Stake on the completion of its quota is printed as a typical expression of such appreciation:
Relief Society General Board Salt Lake City, Utah
Dear Sisters:
Enclosed is a check which pays the Juarez Stake Building Fund quota in full. I am proud to submit this payment for it has proved to be an accurate proof of the devotion of the women of this stake to Relief Society work. It has been collected, not from projects nor sales of material on hand, but by individual solicitations. Not a member but has made an individual contribution as she was solicited by an authorized agent.
The grand total represents all types of sacrifices, ranging from careful saving of a

peso at a time to the denying oneself of a personal need in order to have her donation ready. But in every case the sacrifice was willingly made. Not one sister, when the true facts were presented to her, but wanted to be counted among the contributors. And not one but proved she was equal to any demand made of her, just as are the women of the Church at all times. And not one but will be proud of her part in the erection of a Women's Building, though many there are who will never see it. Not one but feels she has helped the smallest stake in the Church to measure up and compare favorably with the larger and more affluent stakes. They have proved that strength comes from achievement and that confidence and power are obtained by overcoming seeming impossibilities.
Very truly yours,
(Signed) Nellie S. Hatch, President
Rita S. Johnson, Secretary

Individual receipt cards are being issued to the tens of thousands who have given donations. Many of these will be treasured in the years ahead by faithful Relief Society members who are today but girls whose mothers have encouraged their growing daughters to donate so they can be counted as contributors in the years to come. From such a free-will offering given by young girls may spring the roots of a devotion to Relief Society throughout their entire lives which will allow them opportunity to give their services to the Church.

NOTE: The general board regrets that owing to space limitations it will not be possible to accept any more pictures for publication in connection with the report of Building Fund activities. The general board wishes to express appreciation for the pictures already received and for the interest manifested by the sisters in thus keeping a pictorial record of their activities. Those pictures which are not used in the Magazine will be returned so that local societies can use them to illustrate their own histories of their Building Fund activities.
Erratum: In the May 1948 issue of the Magazine, Eureka Branch, Northern California Mission, was listed as being in the California mission.
