Far Country
Gladys I. Hamilton
The conductor touched Ann T Medford's trim-suited shoulder and murmured, "We're coming into Rockwood how, Miss, Our station," "Thank you," Ann said pleasantly, but her hands were so clammy cold with nervousness that her new gloves were wet.
For the hundredth time since leaving Ohio, and her home, Ann wondered if Jim would like her. And, would she like him? Would he still be, man-like, expecting to see her as the eighteen-year-old girl he had been engaged to twenty years ago? Would he be shocked at what those years had done to her pink and white complexion, her soft, brown hair and trim ankles?
She hoped that life had probably changed him more than it had her. Ann was still slim, and her skin quite good. A few silver strands threaded her hair, for there was no denying that the years had left some trace of their passing.
She gathered her things from the hat rack, put her gloves in her purse, then took them out again. She stood up, but the train was still in motion, so she sat down again. She felt as fluttery and unpoised as a school girl, more so, for she hadn't the least idea what she should do or say when she saw him!
Jim would be waiting on the platform, naturally, in plain sight, since Rockwood was such a small prairie town. She needn't get off the minute the train stopped. She could peek out the window and if Jim didn't look . . . well . . . "right," she would just remain on the train and go on to California. Her ticket read straight through, anyway.
Ann and Jim had re-discovered each other only a few weeks ago through a mutual friend who had met Jim in Pendleton at the rodeo. Jim had written first from his ranch in Nevada, and Ann had answered. In the course of correspondence they both marveled that neither had married in all the intervening years. Timidly, they mentioned their old love, and the lover's quarrel in which Ann's mother had taken sides against Jim, which had resulted in Ann's yielding to her mother's wishes and breaking off the engagement.
Jim, his young pride crushed, had gone away shortly afterward. So the immediate question of their letters was, could they still fan the flame of that old love into the joyous wonder that it had been at eighteen and twenty-two?
They both fervently admitted that the fire had never really died, that no other person had interested either one of them, even mildly. Of course they wanted marriage and a home! The joy of marriage and children had been denied them in their youth, but there was still time to make a good life together. It was worth trying, they had concluded.
"I know my mind," Jim had written, "but you must decide, little Ann, for if you follow your heart you will be coming to a far country."
398

The train screeched to a stop and the ding-dong of the engine's bell sent shivery reverberations through Ann's breast. The porter, with her suitcases, was beckoning toward the door so that she had no time to scan the platform. She bit her underlip.
What if she couldn't stand Jim? What if he wore untidy clothes, and.... And had acquired bad habits!
Well, she thought, a person can always be honest and say she has made a mistake.
But Jim wasn't there!
The depot's weathered, splintery old platform was the most deserted, desolate spot she had ever set foot on in all her life! The conductor must have noted her look of horror, for he said calmly, "We'll be here ten minutes, Miss."
Had she really, deep in her heart, expected Jim to meet her? No. For the first time, she was inclined to agree with her mother's judgment of his character.
Ann tried to cover her disappointment and surprise from the gaze of the other passengers by walking briskly to the far end of the platform and looking off into the desert. The odor of sagebrush was pleasantly strong. It was the first time she had ever smelled it, but she knew instinctively what it was, and she liked it!
But her inner being felt hollow with terror. Had Jim at the very last moment decided that he couldn't face her? She knew that the habits of middle age were hard to fling aside. Perhaps he had suddenly realized the contentment of bachelorhood's unfettered days!
"This is western scenery, Ann," she told herself. "Enjoy it!"

The sun was shining with a dazzling brilliance on the shimmering prairies stretching for endless miles on either side of the bleak little station. She thought that she had never seen such cloud-dotted blue, blue sky. Miles to the north, purple mountains broke the line of the horizon. Jim once said that he lived north of the railroad.
A man was hurrying up the track from the big, red water tank, and Ann held her breath. Could that be Jim? But no, this man was small and his hair, under his cap, was snowy white.
"Mornin', Ma'am! Can I he'p ya?" he asked pleasantly.

I was to meet a Mr. James Wallace. But he isn't here. Did you get a message?" "No, Ma'am, I ain't seen Jim fer..." He scratched his tumpled locks in thought. "Why, I ain't seen Jim fer two weeks come Monday. He come down to get some freight. Kinda fancy stuff, too, 'pears to me!" he added with a wink. The engine's bell began to clang and great puffs of black smoke darkened the sky. Ann thanked the old man and, with a stiff little smile frozen on her lips, climbed aboard the train and returned to her seat, while the porter brought back her bags. She tried to lose herself in the rhythm of the clicking wheels as the train gathered momentum. Perhaps it was better this way. The years might have done queer things to that lovable boy she had known and adored. It was quite possible that she could hate him as a man! What to do now? Go on forever in the Hallerton Library? She even chuckled at the mental picture of Far Country herself handing out weighty tomes to the literati of Hallerton, dressed in those new western togs folded so neatly in her suitcase, depleting her clothes' budget for a year! The train made another ten-minute stop at Cottonwood, but Ann did not raise the curtain, caring not at all that this was a sizable town of the real West, another part of her dream. Right now she had no taste for a country that could make a man so changeable that he did not know his own mind for more than four days at a time! For Jim's last letter had been ecstatic with anticipation. The vast prairies could be cruel, too, she supposed. The train gathered more miles under itself, nosing out toward the Coast. Ann supposed that something would help her decide what to do in due time. New friends, new hobbies, anything to keep from remembering. The porter roused her, "You Miss Medford?" "Why... Yes, I am." Ann straightened with surprise and thought that something dreadful must have happened to her brother and his family back home—her only relatives. THE porter handed her, not a telegram, but a folded piece of paper. "A gentleman asked me to hand this to you, Miss." Jim's writing! All the color drained from Ann's face, and for a moment she could not force herself to read his words for fear of what they might say. Probably the very thing she had reasoned out for herself. He had changed his mind! The porter stood patiently in the aisle, as if waiting for a tip, or an answer, or both. Ann read quickly: Dearest Ann: Heaven doesn't come to me easily, it seems. I was hurt this morning by a horse, not badly, but enough so that my partner had to rush me to Cottonwood where the doctor fixed me up before train time. 'Telegraphed and learned that you were aboard. I'm bedded down in a compartment. Guess you'll have to come all the way, sweetheart. Love, Jim. Ann's big moment was still before her! She trembled and a crimson spot burned in each cheek. Her heart was pounding like a tom-tom as she followed the porter's broad back. At length he paused, then motioned her inside. "Ann! Oh, little Ann! I knew you'd look just like this." Jim's pleasant voice came vibrant and tender from the white pillows. And there was Jim. Her old lovable Jim! A trifle heavier, perhaps. More masculine. She noted that the years had painted his crisp black hair slightly gray at the temples, too; but he seemed the same grand person her daydreams had pictured him. "Oh, Jim," Ann whispered as she dropped down beside him. "I... I don't know what to say! The past..., Our.... Our future.... Where shall we begin?" Jim's eyes quirked up in their well remembered old twinkle as he drawled: "Well, we might start with a kiss...." and he drew her into his arms.

Remember Pomanders?
Elizabeth Williamson

Making pomanders isn't a new idea; in fact it is a very old one. Grandmother made them, true, but centuries before her time they were in use. The superstitious peoples of the middle ages wore them on chains around their necks. Instead of the pomander we know, these ancient pomanders were small metal containers beautifully designed. They were worn to ward off the plague and to protect the wearer from contagious diseases. Frequently they contained a tiny book of prayers or spells. Occasionally they held herbs and spices as a scent, that were believed to serve as a disinfectant. By the time the pomander had reached our grandmothers it had changed considerably. The only feature that it had retained was that of furnishing fragrance. Fruit took the place of metal. Its purpose was no longer connected with superstitious belief. Now it served to scent the linens and keep the closets and boxes perfumed.

Pomanders are easily made: take an apple (some people prefer oranges or lemons) and cover it with whole cloves pushed in to the head, and sprinkle with cinnamon. Let the pomander dry until the juices evaporate and the fragrance of the spices is absorbed by the fruit. Wrap in cellophane, tie with a pretty ribbon, and you have a lovely and unusual gift.

Let's Have Cake
Ethel C. Smith
Member, Relief Society General Board

Now that we are back once more on free and easy terms with our sugar bins, it should not be difficult to answer the challenging query, "What's for dessert?" made by the small fry in our families as they gather around the dinner table, their expectant eyes shining from freshly scrubbed faces. If it's to be cake, they will all be delighted, as cake, in its varied forms and flavors, is a favorite of young and old alike. It is also a favorite with the cook because it is so versatile, standing alone on its own merits, or mixing companionably with fruit, ice cream, and various sauces; and it is the perfect accompaniment to punch or a glass of milk. It can be served as a dinner or luncheon dessert, is an old standby as a party refreshment, and behaves well when sent along to school in the lunch box.

There is an art to turning out a perfect cake, in which many cooks take the same pride and delight that an artist takes in blending colors and capturing a picture on canvas. Cakes may vary in shape—they may be round, oblong, square, or of some more elaborate form—but a perfect cake is always attractive in appearance and of uniform thickness. The crust is delicate brown, thin, tender, and slightly crisp, with no cracks. Perfect cake is light, tender, and moist. It has an even, fine-grained texture and a delicate flavor.

Most experienced cooks prepare some favorite dishes by taste or instinct, using the "pinch of this and dash of that" method with excellent results.

In the matter of cake making, however, there are a few basic rules which must be followed if the desired results are to be forthcoming. There is no doubt that merit in the new so-called "mix-easy" method of cake making being suggested by some manufacturers of cake flour, especially where the saving of time is of great importance. Recipes and directions are furnished by the manufacturers in their packages of flour, should you care to try them. However, the real thrill of making a cake comes from beating, blending, and mixing the different ingredients a step at a time, and from the perfect product which will reward the cook who gives the ingredients individual attention and introduces them to each other with due consideration. A culinary triumph is assured the cook who will use a tested recipe and will be guided by the following basic rules: Use Good Ingredients Only; ingredients that are strictly fresh and of good quality should be used if you wish to make a fine cake. The shortening must be of the best quality. There is nothing equal to butter for putting real flavor in a cake, but because of the high cost of butter today, it is sometimes necessary to substitute other shortenings when the recipe calls for butter. The following are equivalent to one-half cup butter: 1/2 cup oleomargarine; 7 tablespoons vegetable shortening; 6 1/2 tablespoons lard; 1 1/2 cups thick cream.Fine, granulated sugar makes a finer-textured cake than coarse sugar. If sugar is coarse or lumpy, it should be sifted and only the finer particles used. Cake flour, which is made from soft, winter wheat, makes a lighter, more tender cake than ordinary all-purpose flour made from the harder wheat. Sponge and angel food cakes demand this lighter cake flour, but very satisfactory butter cakes can be made with all-purpose flour. Cakes containing nuts or fruits are less likely to be crumbly if made with all-purpose flour. If a substitution of all-purpose flour is made when a recipe calls for cake flour, about two tablespoons less to a cup should be used or the cake mixture will be too stiff. You will not have success with sponge or angel food cakes if all-purpose flour is substituted for cake flour.

Eggs, milk, and all other ingredients should be strictly fresh and of good quality. Temperature of Ingredients: All ingredients should be allowed to stand until they have assumed normal room temperature before mixing the cake. Measuring: Do not attempt to guess at measurements. All ingredients should be accurately measured with standard measuring cups and spoons. Level off with a spatula or the straight edge of a knife, as measurements are assumed to be level unless otherwise specified. Flour should be sifted before measuring as it has a tendency to settle down and become heavy, and the sifting process mixes air into it. After being sifted, the flour should be spooned into the measuring cup. It should then be resifted with the other dry ingredients called for in the recipe.

Mixing: Use either the beating or folding motion for mixing. When using an electric mixer, the beating time should be slightly less than when mixing by hand. Angel and sponge cakes will be lighter if mixed by hand and a wire whisk used. The beating motion should be employed for the first part of the mixing process and the folding motion during the latter part when the flour is added. In butter cakes, the sugar and shortening should be beaten and blended into a light, fluffy, smooth mixture. A round-bottomed bowl is the best type of mixing bowl to use, and if the mixing is done by hand, a wooden spoon is more satisfactory than a metal spoon. When the eggs, or egg yolks, are added, which is generally the next step in the mixing process, they should be beaten vigorously into the sugar mixture. This is the point where your beating will do the most good.

Alternate the dry ingredients and liquid when adding to the mixture, beginning and ending with dry ingredients. A good plan to follow is to add a third of the flour and half of the milk at a time, alternately. As these ingredients are added, the mixing speed should be reduced. At the same time, dawdling is not in order at this point and the mixing should be continuous with no stops. Mix well after each addition, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a spatula or rubber scraper.

If egg whites are to be added separately from the yolks, they should be stiffly beaten and folded in after the dry ingredients and liquid have been mixed. Nuts and fruits, if called for, come last and should be folded in, after being lightly dredged with flour. The dredging helps them to stick to the dough in the proper places instead of huddling together at the bottom of the pan.

As soon as the cake is mixed and poured into the pans, it should be whisked into the oven without delay. The light, fluffy mixture which will be the result of your efforts thus far will assume a sad, depressed attitude if kept waiting for the comforting warmth of the oven. If the baking pans haven't been prepared beforehand, or the oven hasn't reached the desired heat, or if you stop to answer the telephone, your cake will get even with you for your neglect by being heavy and sad.

Pans in which butter cakes are to be baked should be well greased and lightly floured; but pans for butterless cakes, such as sponge or angel food, should never be greased. Cake pans should be filled two-thirds full and set in, or near, the center of the oven so the cake will bake evenly.

Baking: This is a very important step in cake making. Many fine batters have been ruined in the baking. The oven temperature and time required for baking depend upon the size and kind of cake. For successful baking results, the oven temperature must be uniform, not constantly rising and falling. Most cakes should be baked at a temperature of 350 to 375 degrees. A slightly increased temperature should be used at higher altitudes.

There are several ways to tell when a cake is done, and it is well to use some of these tests even though the cake has been baked the specified length of time. First, the cake should have finished rising and should have a delicate brown crust; second, the cake should have ceased the "singing" sound; third, the cake should have shrunk slightly from the sides of the pan; fourth, the surface of the cake, when pressed lightly with the finger, should spring back and leave no imprint if it is done; fifth, a wire cake tester or a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake should come out clean and dry if the cake is done.

After baking, butter cakes should be inverted on a cake rack and allowed to stand for about five minutes before the pan is removed.

It may be advisable to run a spatula or a knife around the outside of the cake to loosen it from the pan before inverting. Sponge and angel food cakes should not be loosened from the pan while warm, as this will cause them to shrink. They should be inverted and allowed to hang in the pan for one hour, or until cold.

High Altitude Baking
At high altitude there should be a slight reduction of the baking powder and sugar given in cake recipes and the liquid may need to be increased a little. The baking temperature should be a little higher. This chart for higher altitudes has been found satisfactory: �JUNE 1948

BADGE OF TRIUMPH
Maryhale Woolsey
I saw them but once, in passing by.
Twin little shacks in a mining town.
They sat side by side like gray old dames,
Each in a shabby and faded gown.
And one cringed hopelessly, bowed to doom;
But one had a heart that was brave and gay.
(In one little moment I saw them so,
For only once did I pass that way.)

How did I know?
Why, this was the sign:
The house that held courage and laughter still,
Waved bright ruffled curtains to greet the breeze,
And tulips bloomed on its window sill.

THEN AND NOW
Della Adams Leitner
When I was young and dreams were all romantic,
My lover was so handsome, brave and tall,
Wooing with constant ardor and devotion,
With eager haste responsive to love's call.
The years have passed; John sits before the fire
Warming his slippered feet that feel the cold.

He's bald and thin and short and rather stubborn, but kind and true— and I am gray and old.
How time has changed my girlhood's fond delusion, but I am not unhappy, for it seems Life gave me more than I had asked in finding Companionship beyond my cherished dreams.

Pressed-Flower Pictures
A FEW SIMPLIFIED HINTS FOR BEGINNERS
Dorothy J. Roberts

The hands of frugal housewives have long preserved the fruits of summer for winter appetites. Why should not then the fingers of the garden lover preserve the blossoms of the season for beauty-hungry eyes, since, as the poet Housman says, ". . . to look at things in bloom, fifty springs are little room."

Many flowers may be enjoyed beyond the brief period of their blooming by a bit of careful preparation and the whole family can participate in this pleasurable pastime. Have you ever seen a pressed-flower picture, or, more fun still, have you ever made one? Not only are these pictures delightful variations to hang upon your own walls, but they make charming gifts.

When the family become interested, they will, voluntarily, turn collectors and bring home from neighbors, relatives and friends, specimens not found in your own garden. Experimentation will soon prove which flowers hold their form and color best through the process of pressing. But press them in abundance, since the greater the variety of flowers, the more opportunities they afford for the making of satisfactory compositions.

The making of pressed-flower pictures has extensive possibilities in the field as well as in the commercial field. However, here only a few suggestions are given for those wishing to try a hand at a new hobby. Flowers should be pressed in warm, dry weather, or they tend to lose color and turn brown. They should be picked in their prime and pressed immediately. For this purpose have at hand a number of old books and a few heavy rocks to use as weights. One book will press several flowers. Old volumes may be purchased from used-book counters at small cost for this unscholarly purpose.

Remember the old adage, "As the twig is bent . . ." for, as you place the flowers between the leaves of the book, so you will find them shaped when they become dry. Arrange the petals in the most graceful way, with about an inch or more margin at the top and bottom of the page. Then close the book and compress for a moment before placing the next flower. When the book is filled, weight it with a rock or other books and a rock. Let them stand undisturbed until dry—a period of two weeks or more.

Small rock-garden plants, blue Veronica, white rock-garden spirea, and many others are dainty when pressed. Miniature roses and buds, clusters of climbing rosebuds, the pink ones, especially, are exquisite. Columbine, pinks, larkspur of all colors, Valeriana, small zinnias, and all daisies are good material. Pansies, carefully pressed, are bright and colorful. Sweet peas, especially white ones, are translucent and ethereal. Snapdragons are rich and full-bodied but require special pressure. Delphiniums are particularly delightful to work with, either in flowerets, or using the whole stock, because of their lovely shades of blue. Yellow, pink, and blue hold color well. Some reds and orchids tend to darken slightly.

As beginners, try pressing types of flowers which are not too heavy, such as large roses, nor too fragile, such as nasturtiums. By the end of your pressing season, you should have gathered, in your spare moments, a few interesting picture frames from dime stores or used-furniture marts. For the beginner, not wishing to make his own frames and not quite ready to attempt large, elaborate pictures, small, quaint, decorative frames are most suitable. A distinctive and inexpensive one is of dark mahogany, about an inch wide, with gilt beading at the inner edge.

Other supplies needed are a few 8 x 12-inch sheets of good drawing paper to use as backgrounds for your flower compositions. When you are ready for the framing, have this equipment at your elbow: a pair of pliers, a supply of small picture framing nails, a spool of thread and, if desired, a few hand-tied bows of pastel colored velvet baby ribbon to place near the stem ends.

When flowers and materials are ready, and you have a long, free, sunny day, prepare yourself for an uninterrupted period of delightful concentration. You will find that the children can, with your help, work out some attractive pictures of their own. Prepare frames by drawing out the nails with pliers from the backs of the pictures. Remove the glass and lay it aside until needed, discard the picture of the movie celebrity and keep the cardboard backing. Cut the drawing paper to fit the cardboard and on this drawing paper, fitted over the cardboard, build your picture.

Distribute your beauty crop of pressed flowers carefully over a white sheet on a large table where light is favorable and abundant. Spread the flowers in one layer so that you can see them all at a glance, for you will need to try out many combinations before finding the arrangement that is most pleasing. You will learn to keep each picture in one mood, that is, to select flowers agreeable in size, form and color, upon a harmonizing background. Do not use flowers too sparingly; have a substantial mass of color and pattern on your paper.

For example, try a group of tiny pink rosebuds and blue delphinium flowerets on a background of white sweet peas and white rock garden spirea with fine blue Veronica at the edges. Build this on a white background, with a perky blue bow laid lightly near the stem ends, if desired. Pansies of varied purples and golds are effective on a pale green or pale orchid background.

When you have worked out a pleasing picture, place the glass carefully over it, pressing firmly on the glass with the right hand to hold the flowers in place. With the left hand, gently push the entire picture to the edge of the table so that the glass protrudes about two inches beyond the table edge. Then place the left hand under the protruding edge of the picture and, still pressing the top of the glass with the right hand, turn the entire picture upside down on the table.

Now, pressing the spool against the head of the nail, Page THE GRADUATE NURSE Olive C. Wehr

I saw you graduate last night—
A girl grown woman-wise,
Arrayed in emblematic white,
With stars deep in your eyes!

I saw you moving down the years,
Serene and unafraid,
While easing pain, dispelling fears,
And working undismayed.

Though holding in your cool, strong hands
A trembling life; nor yet
Complaining of the day's demands
While evening stars had set.

In touch with all life's mystery,
Whether of death or birth
And failing not in sympathy—
An angel come to earth!

I saw you graduate last night;
I paused to smile and nod,
And say how well you looked in white—
And now you work with God!

HEARTBREAK Cherry McKay Hearts but seldom break in sudden sorrow; Only the rending years can tear apart The sturdy faith that on some crimson morrow Life once more will prime the pulseless heart. But if a heart holds tears unspilled, and captures All the past, to bind it with love- thongs, That heart may burst in a valley-spring of raptures, And filtered tears pour through in sudden songs.

Questing Lights Belle Watson Anderson Chapter 3 Synopsis: Andrew Rumgay leaves his mother and his fiancée Jane Allison in Scotland and joins his friend Hugh Shand to emigrate to America. They meet Mother MacKinlay and her son Bob whom they had known while doing missionary work, and also become acquainted with Kathleen Coleman and her friend Margaret Purvis. Hugh and Kathleen are married on board the ship.

As the early, glimmering dawn softly silvered the Iowa prairies, a camp, with a large central tent surrounded by many smaller tents, was revealed near the banks of a winding stream. Three miles north of Iowa City on a spot where the grass was long and tender, the Woods company had camped the night before. They had come from New York City on the train and now were resting on the land purchased by the Church for the use of emigrants on their long journey to the Salt Lake Valley.

The men of the Woods encampment were up at daylight. There was work to be done. It was getting late in the year, almost too late to begin a journey to a mountainous country far away—there was no time to lose. The camp life was different from the limited activities of the ship and train, and the emigrants were very grateful for the change. There was fresh, pure air to breathe, clean living quarters, and a variety of food, vegetables and fruit from the farmers' gardens, wild berries growing on the prairies, fish in the streams, and abundant game on every side.

Hugh and Andrew brought in dry wood to burn. They knew what the women would call for as soon as they put their heads out of their tent doors, and it wasn't very long until they began appearing like bees coming out of their hives for the day's supply of honey. Then there was a call for prayer, and right after breakfast a priesthood meeting. Everything must be planned and work assigned at once. Some of the men would leave early next day to buy provisions, material for building handcarts, wagons, cattle, horses, and oxen for the trek. All the other men would go to work for the farmers. The women would wash and mend the bedding and clothing.

Andrew came in to dinner. "Well, Mother Mac, we'll be up and leaving for work at daylight in the morning. The farmers have even asked us over to breakfast." "But not too early in the morning. Sonny, we're having those prairie chickens for supper tomorrow night and the fish for breakfast the next morning." "What prairie chickens? What fish?" asked Andrew. "What is going on around here? I thought I was the head of this house?" "Not while I'm around, Brother Rumgay. You may have your place, but it isn't preparing the meals. Hugh is out getting the chickens. Father Coleman and Bob are catching the fish." "We hope," Andrew returned wistfully. "Well you just couldn't stay away tomorrow night. 'Tomorrow is Margaret's birthday. She'll be twenty-two years old." "Not so loud, Mother, not so loud, young ladies do not like their ages shouted about. That's why they fix up so much—why Margaret's only a few months younger than I am." "Yes, and she looks it too. Margaret is a very pretty lass, and I'm making a grand birthday dinner for her—saleratus biscuits, breasts of the prairie chickens fried to a turn, gravy, and green corn, crab-apple dumplings, boiled. Now, will you be home for dinner?" "Just try and keep me away. How did you catch on to the way of cooking these American dishes? It is plain to see what women talk about when they are alone."

Bob and Brother Coleman came in with a long string of fish. Also, they had picked a beautiful bouquet of flowers, wild sweet williams, prairie lilies, and windflowers. "See what I mean, Andrew? These are for the party," said Mother Mac. Margaret came over early the next morning to help Mother with the work. "Happy birthday, my dear, and many happy returns of the day." Mother put her arms around the young lady and gave her a good hug and a squeeze for good measure. "Thanks, dear Mother Mac, you have a heart big enough for the whole world."

"Well, it will be a queer world, Margaret darling, when a mother stops loving her own children. I hope that will never happen to me." "It's a wonderful thing someone can love me," Margaret answered.

Mother stopped her work. "Now look here, dearie, you're not building up a lot of heartaches for yourself, are you, now? You know Andrew likes all the girls in the company, Scotch girls, and all the others, but he's in love with Jane, you know that. He'll always be true. V her, so if IT were you I'd forget all about him. There are so many young men in the company, Brother Nelson, Brother Walker, and oh, so many others."

"So many others, and yet when I marry it's going to be to a Scotchman, who will look just like Andrew Rumgay." "Oh, it's so foolish, Margaret, so very foolish."

"So foolish, when I love the very ground he walks on? I didn't know there were men like him in the world. All the men I knew were those who worked in the factory, common, rough, uncouth men, whose ideas of women were the world's concepts. Then I meet a man who puts women on a pedestal, something to be cherished, cared for, loved—I may be foolish, but I will love him till I die."

Bob and Brother Coleman had brought in a stack of logs for a bonfire. After supper the women washed the dishes, sang songs, played games, and then decided to go to bed. Mother Mac would be up early to fry the fish for the boys before they went to work.

Some of the men had raised the question about going on to the QUESTING LIGHTS Valley this summer. If the fall was about as usual everything would be all right; they would have plenty of time to make it into the Salt Lake Valley.

Andrew came out of the Woods tent into the night's fairy firelight. A beautiful night, a beautiful girl walked over to the fire. "Where are the others, Margaret? Am I so very late? Did we spoil the party?" "No, Mother Mac wanted to get up early to fry the fish. Kathleen was tired, and I am too excited to sleep."

I have just now finished my diary, a little dizzy when I think of the rocking of the boat, but on the whole no worse for wear, even when I think of you and the conductor on the train. Andrew—I laugh right out loud each time I think of you and that giant conductor, almost having a fight."

"That was so uncalled for, Margaret. You never make a wrong right by adding another wrong."
Margaret, still laughing, added, "But you have to figure. Brother Rumgay, that first, last, and all the time, you are a Scotchman. Then all the trimmings come after that—and those Scotch tempers! Oh! Oh!"
"That's one reason the crew were so mean, all along the way, the Scotch pay for their tempers."
"Well, I see Kathleen left the tent flap open for me, so I'm off to bed. You will need your rest so you can work tomorrow, and you'll need to take it easy the first few days, Andrew, till you get a little used to the work. Good night."
Andrew sat and gazed about him till the fire went out. Night in America—no sound but the babbling of the water, and the rustling of corn in the distance.
Margaret stayed with Mother while the men were away. Kathleen had Brother Coleman to cook for. He had stayed from the fields to bring water and wood for the women's washings. But the women found both on the banks of the stream. They washed for days and hung their clean white clothes on the bushes.

"What is more downright satisfying than a pretty, white wash flying in the breeze?" Mother looked and looked at the clothes. "You ken, Margaret, they'll be up in the morning that beat the Scotch women 414 washing. The American women's clothes aren't a bit whiter than ours."

That evening they sat around the campfire in deep conversation. Kathleen joined them after supper, and sat down very close to Mother, snuggled up under her arm.

"I'm going to tell you the sweetest story a woman ever told." Kathleen pulled Mother's arm around her for protection, for support. "We're going to have a baby."

Margaret got up and moved to the other side of Kathleen, so they would not need to talk in whispers. This was something special, something sacred.

"Are you a tiny bit scared, Kathleen, because we are on the plains?" 

"No, not one bit, Margaret. Other women are having their children, why shouldn't I have mine? Nearly every week a baby is born. Why should I be frightened? Nothing ever happens by chance. God will take care of me and the baby. I wonder if it will be a boy or a girl. If it's a boy we'll call him Andrew, because Hugh and Andrew are such good friends. It it's a girl I'd like to call her after both of you, but how can 1?"

"We'd better choose a name your daughter would approve of, Kathleen," Margaret suggested.

"Think how wonderful to have a daughter like you, Margaret! I would like her to be just like you!"

"That's the sweetest compliment I was ever paid. Thanks, Kathleen."

Hugh and Andrew were anxious to learn everything about building handcarts and repairing wagons, so they left the farm work to the others of their ward. It was very hard to get the handcarts ready for the road. The wheels were faulty; material in many instances was poor. Finally, after weeks of hard work, most of the handcarts were ready.

The day had been spent in packing wagons and handcarts. Tomorrow the mules and ponies would be packed and all would be ready for the trail, but Andrew was still working on his handcart. The wood was so dry and hard that when he thought it was all finished, something else would happen.

"Look at it, Andrew," Hugh said, "the worst one in the bunch. Why did you choose that one?"

"Well, we couldn't leave it behind. We need handcarts so badly and it may as well be mine. I hope it stays with me to the end of the road."

"But you have your doubts. So have I," Hugh said as he gave one of the wheels a last hard shake.

The next morning Brother Woods pulled out with the first wagon. Brother Nelson led with the handcarts, and Brother Rumgay was the last to leave camp.

"The last, the best of all the game," Margaret offered, "but who wants to be the last one?"

"Andrew, you're bothered this morning." Mother Mac looked anxiously at him. "Come now, what's on your mind?" Andrew tried to smile and pass it off, but Mother was determined.

"Well, we were told to bring only the necessities, but books have been as necessary to me as my food. I can't take them. There isn't room for them. I'll have to leave them in father's kist."

"If we divide them, and each of us takes a few, Andrew, then we could take them, couldn't we?" asked Margaret.

"No, there just isn't room for them. Hugh and I have tried to figure a way out, but it can't be done. Every tiny space must be used for food. A handcart isn't very large, you know, and if it's too heavy it will be too hard to pull. Lots of other things to worry about, but I've never been without my books."

"We all love them, don't we, Hugh?" Kathleen added, in sympathy.

"Yes, we recall my sick days aboard the ship, and the help and consolation they brought us," Hugh spoke gratefully.

"Well, maybe someone who appreciates books will find them. They may prove to be good missionaries." Margaret was trying to add a note of cheer.

"I'll look around and see that everything is taken care of. You folks go on up the line. No need for us all to stay behind," Hugh suggested.

Bob and Brother Coleman went with Andrew to see that all the fires were out and nothing was left behind. Everything was in order. Now they could All take to, the road.

THEY spent the first hours getting adjusted to pulling their handcarts. Even in this they found there was a great art. They passed many sloughs and swamps, and had to be very careful to stay on the road. The corn, just coming into tassel, reminded the saints of the quick passing of the summer days.

"The fields of growing corn, dependent on the sun and the rain for their growth, suggest to me our 415 dependence upon our Heavenly Father," Kathleen said.

"Yes," Margaret replied, "and if God cares for the corn in the field, and provides for its welfare, how much more can his children trust him for their security, even on a Strange road in a strange country."

"God is taking care of us, I'm sure," affirmed Mother Mac. "I have felt his helpful influence many times since leaving home."

That night Mother, Margaret, and Kathleen came hobbling into camp. They went over to the creek, removed their shoes and stockings, and soaked their feet in the cool water.

"What a relief!" Margaret cried, giving vent to a heavy sigh. Kathleen was worried. "What on earth will we do, walking every day, and our feet in this condition?" "Nature is a wonderful doctor," Mother assured her: "In a day or two our feet will be better than ever, strong for the strain and exercise they must take." But the women were late with supper that night and could hardly have managed at all without the help of Brother Coleman. Andrew and Hugh worked on the handcarts that had broken down during the day. Bob helped with the herding, spreading out the horses and cattle as far as possible, so they would get in enough grazing before dark. The grass was abundant, and the animals tired and hungry after their first day's full haul.

Each day the emigrants traveled more miles, and their muscles seemed to adjust themselves to the strain and work of the road, for, as Mother Mac said, "Nature is a wonderful friend to take with you on a journey." Each day they were hungry and ready for their food. They constantly breathed the clean, pure air of the prairies and it was not long before even the old men and women could take the day's advance in comfort. They left the cabins and corn and all cultivation behind them. Their way was through miles of prairie, with only nature's primitive gifts of land and sky. Silence lay before them, behind them, and was with them every moment.

One day Margaret said, "Even the people have become silent. It seems that there is nothing to be said. Behind us lie our yesterdays marked by a tuft of grass, a tree, or a creek of water. Before us lie our tomorrows, rising each day from the bed the sun has used the night before to sleep in."

"Yes, even I have been quiet longer than for anytime in my life," Mother responded. "Every mile and every hour are filled with the throbbing rhythm of the land and the ever-changing pictures in the sky. The atmosphere is heavy-laden with beautiful thoughts, but no words." "The birds are satisfied to fly from tree to tree. They may sing to their young, but we do not hear them."

Kathleen was expressing the longing of her heart. Margaret was thinking that perhaps the silence of the land was the expression of the future. A lovely dream that could have become a reality would always lie dormant and silent because the love she longed for would be claimed by another. She thought of the homes that some day would be built upon these silent acres in response to the plow and the farmer's song, awakening the land and bringing the vibrant voices of happy children to the melody of busy reapers.

As they passed silently on towards night, clouds appeared in the west. (To be continued)

SONG FOR A DAUGHTER
Margery S. Stewart watched you running across the road From school, like a blown leaf or flower, Tree shadows on your face.
You paused To shake the lilac, laughing under shower Of cupped rain. How tall you seemed, How frail your fingers and how bright Your hair. Childhood gone, like laughter Lost...
Years out of sound and sight.
In the sun, holding your face to summer, I watched you turn and bend. You called my name and in your voice I heard The love of friend for friend.

Photograph submitted by Gladys Rudd EAST MILLCREEK STAKE (SALT LAKE COUNTY, UTAH), EVERGREEN WARD PRESENTS "A VISIT INTO THE PAST—THE RICHARDS HOME; IN NAUVOO," January 19, 1948 Women at the Richards home in Nauvoo, Illinois. Sister Rudd comments: "Note the old checkered tablecloth, the coal oil lamp, the great ornate Bible, the picture of the Prophet, and the authentic costumes of the sisters. The group found Emma Smith to be greatly worried over the sufferings of her husband, incarcerated in jail, but the other women consoled her. They read letters received from the Prophet. Later, two sisters dropped in on their way from singing practice. They were urged to sing and agreed, providing Sister Kimball would accompany them on the organ. This she did while they sang "Jesus, Lover of My Soul" and the Prophet's beloved hymn "A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief." With this music, the Nauvoo sisters again departed into the past. Then the literature class discussed, with deepened appreciation, that great soul, Joseph Smith and his inspiring letters."
Annie Perkins is literature class leader in Evergreen Ward and Vessa Marler wrote the dramatization. Sarah E. Bateman is president of East Millcreek Stake Relief Society.

428 A House By Friday (Continued from page 384) blues, and reds. I gave one look and knew it was not for me.

THAT night, more in desperation than in hope, we rode by the Lomas house. It was lighted, and after much bell ringing and waiting, we were admitted. The owner was there, assisted by three maids. Feverishly she told us that an American doctor, with no children, would occupy the house manana en la manana. We went quietly out. It was Thursday morning and I had one place left, an apartment far out. It was occupied by an American lady who was moving soon, the agency said.

The lady received me; the apartment was all that one could wish, even to the lovely hued Mexican hand-woven rugs and the blonde furniture. There was only one drawback: the lady would not vacate until she could find a house for the same price. She had been looking for six months. The end of my list had been reached.

There were still some apartments in the heart of the town, but we were not going to investigate them, even as a last resort. I made a quick decision. Calling to the driver, I showed him the address on Aguas Calientes. "Si, Senora," he said, wheeling his car about. The Senora was home and she led me into the walled garden. This time I did not allow her to lead the conversation. I sat firmly on the cold tile seat and asked if we could have the house.
