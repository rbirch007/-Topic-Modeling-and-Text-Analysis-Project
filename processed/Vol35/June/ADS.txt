A HOUSE BY FRIDAY "Are you certain you wish it?" she asked anxiously. "It is too much for me, too upsetting of the head and heart, too much work for the maids, to have to rent it again soon. You will be satisfied? You will not want everything changed?"

"No," I said, so happy I was scarcely breathing. "It is my house. I felt it as soon as I saw it. Each night I have said a little prayer that if it were right for us to have it, you would say yes."

Her eyes grew soft. "Each night I, too, have said my little prayer that I would find the right ones to live in my house." Her face brightened. "You may have the house if you wish it." Tomorrow, she said, was short notice, but we could move in. If the maids could not have everything in readiness, we could be patient, no?

At night we came to arrange about the lease. It would be ready in a day or two, she told us. She came to a quick understanding with my husband about the Diplomatic Proviso. Then he drew out his checkbook to pay the first month's rent. She waived it aside. Time enough to pay it, she insisted, when we were settled and the lease signed.

The moon was shining when we passed through the garden. We stood by the fountain, savoring this moment when we no longer felt like intruders in an alien land. The difficult part of our Mexican move was over.

"Yes," Mr. Tarlock said to one of the American men we met as we passed through the lobby with our bags the next day, "we have our house. Got here on Friday night and we're moving in this Friday noon. My wife did it all herself, too. Couldn't speak a word of Spanish, either. Just had to let herself go and she did it."

430 You Can Write a Prize Winner (Continued from page 373) children; an individual should struggle for survival. Abnormal reactions require such insight and sympathy and skill in portrayal that the novice butchers them and makes them ugly or ridiculous or unconvincing. Just one more word�as to length. Use just enough words to tell the story. Start at the initial situation, tight spang-bang in the thing that sets the story going. If it is necessary to tell what happened before this, give it in short "flash-backs" sandwiched in between bits of forward moving action. And stop when the emotional experience has been realized by the characters. Never go on to tell how it affected the next generation or the cousins in Duluth or Timbuctu.

And there it is�for what it is worth�and may some of those exciting and illuminating stories be written now.

May I compliment you on the beauti-ful poetry the Magazine contains. It is heartening for those of us who write to find publications of your caliber using verse. I especially liked "For Some Ap-pointed Reason" by Berta Huish Christen-sen and "Too Frail a Lute" by Eva Willes Wangsgaard in the February (1948) issue. � Elaine Swain, Vallejo, California I am a convert to the Church and have been in America since 1923. I have taken the Magazine since 1927 when my first poem was published and loved it ever since, and suspect I shall all my life. I am English, but I dearly love the temple spires, the snow-capped mountains, and the beau-tiful new, white [aluminum] roof of the Tabernacle. � Helen Hall McQuarrie, Salt Lake City, Utah We do appreciate the inspiration that the general board gives to us in various ways. The March Relief Society Magazine alone is worth the $1.50 for a year's sub-scription. Every person I have talked with since it came I have encouraged to read it from cover to cover. � Jennie M. Butler, Secretary Snowflake Stake Relief Society (Arizona) Page 432 Allow me to send greetings from the heart of Europe. So many things have happened in this small country within the past few months. May I say that the Maga-zine brings me a great deal of joy at this time, since it keeps us up to date on Relief Society affairs at home. The Magazine is one of the fine publications that comes through the censor and I do enjoy reading its uplifting and educational contents. � Martha S. Toronto, President Czechoslovakian Mission Relief Society Prague Thank you for publishing my story "A New Stove for Mother" in the April Magazine. It was really an honor to have it included in that issue. I enjoyed read-ing the stories by the other ladies. As I was reading, I thought how nice it would be to meet and know some of the other writers who help make up the Magazine. I truly appreciate the help and encourage-ment which the editors have given me. � Norma Wrathall, Grantsville, Utah INEZ WHITLOCK MAKES 150 QUILT TOPS FOR RELIEF SOCIETY During the past ten years.
