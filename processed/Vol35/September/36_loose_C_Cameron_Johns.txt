THEVOL. 35, NO. 9 SEPTEMBER 1948 SOMETHING IN YOUR WORD Dorothy J Roberts Something in your word is summer crying, A linnet in the fading interlude Between the empty nest and fall wind sighing, Remembering the blossom and the brood. Something in your voice is summer calling To wings turned southward from the changing hill; The echoes fade where tarnished gold is falling, And the lagging pulse of summertime grows still. Something in your song is summer singing When fall has stopped the treble of my throat; The cool, gray current from the north is flinging The leagues of earth against your silver note.
