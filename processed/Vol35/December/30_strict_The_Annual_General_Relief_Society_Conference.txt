The Annual General Relief Society Conference September 29 and 30, 1948.
Margaret C. Pickering, General Secretary-Treasurer

THE annual general Relief Society conference for 1948 was held Wednesday and Thursday, September 29 and 30, at Salt Lake City, Utah, with President Belle S. Spafford presiding. A historic feature of the 1948 conference was the announcement at the Thursday morning session in the Tabernacle of the successful completion of fund-raising for a Relief Society building. The conference opened Wednesday morning with an officers meeting in the Assembly Hall which was almost filled to capacity with stake and mission officers. Elder G. Homer Durham, speaking in place of Elder Mark E. Petersen who was unable to attend, gave an address on "Home, the Cradle of Liberty." The annual report and official instructions were presented by President Belle S. Spafford. Margaret F. Richards, President of the Stadium Village Relief Society, Emigration Stake, spoke on "A Young Mother Discovers Relief Society," and Secretary Pickering discussed "Stake Board Functions." Roll call showed 171 stakes and 19 missions reporting, Oahu being the only stake unrepresented. All mission Relief Society presidents from the United States, Canada, and Mexico, who had been specially invited by the First Presidency to attend the conference, were present. Wednesday Page 802 afternoon, departmental meetings, all well attended, were held from 1:00 to 2:00 P.M. For the welfare, Magazine, and secretary-treasurers departments, and from 2:15 to 3:15 p.m.

For the educational, work, and music departments. In the evening the annual reception for visiting stake and mission officers was held in the Lafayette Ballroom at the Hotel Utah. Preceding the reception a formal presentation was held at which gifts for the new building were presented to the general board. An oil landscape painted by Samuel Jepperson, a pioneer artist, was presented by Utah Stake Relief Society; a woven tag throw rug by the Marsh Center Ward, Portneuf Stake; a handcrocheted set of tidies made and presented as a personal gift by Lavaughn Fowler, president of the Inkom Ward Relief Society, Pocatello Stake. The gifts were displayed during the reception.

The general session in the Tabernacle Thursday morning was devoted to recognition of the Building Fund achievement and was conducted by Counselor Marianne C., Sharp, chairman of the Building Fund committee. A recorded dramatization, "The Symbol of a Dream," written by Verda Mae Fuller, under direction of Mary G. Judd, gave the historical highlights of The ANNUAL GENERAL RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE long-cherished desire of Relief Society women for a building. A portion of the dramatization consisted of reproductions of the voices of early leaders and Bishop Marvin O. Ashton, and the actual voices of President George Albert Smith, President Spafford, and Counselor Sharp. This was recorded before the meeting and broadcast into the Tabernacle during the meeting.

A large replica of the building was placed across the center section of the organ. Windows in the replica were made to light up, one by one, as each group of stakes was given recognition, and the door was illuminated when the missions were recognized. This part of the program was entitled "From the Shadow of a Dream to the Sunlight of Promise," and was written by Vesta P. Crawford under the direction of Priscilla L. Evans and read by Sister Evans.

President Belle S. Spafford, addressing the meeting on "Joy In Full Measure," expressed gratitude to the women of the Church that, through their untiring efforts and devotion, the goal had been reached in one year. In an address entitled "And What of the Promise?" Counselor Marianne C. Sharp summarized the Building Fund project and reported the receipt of $554,016 to date. Bishop LeGrand Richards commended the organization for its support of Church activities in 1933 and congratulated it on achieving the Building Fund quota.

The general session Thursday afternoon was conducted by President Spafford and featured an address by President George Albert Smith, in which he called attention to the unique place in the world held by Relief Society and complimented the women on their devotion to the cause they serve. Counselor Velma N. Simonsen spoke on "Our Responsibility to Inactive Members," and Blanche B. Stoddard on "A Measuring Rod for Growth." The conference was concluded with an address by President Spafford.

Music for the sessions on Thursday was furnished by a combined chorus of 450 Singing Mothers from the stakes of the Salt Lake region, directed by Florence J. Madsen, with Elder Frank W. Asper at the organ. A special feature of the music program Thursday morning was the rendition by the chorus of "Build, Thou, for Life's Immortal Goal," composed specially for the occasion by Sister Madsen. This Singing Mothers chorus, which sang at both Thursday sessions, also sang the following day at the first two sessions of the semi-annual general conference of the Church.

At the Wednesday morning officers meeting, Dorothy Kimball Keddington sang "The Flag Without a Stain," and Beverly B. Glauser played appropriate prelude and postlude numbers on the organ.

The conference addresses "Joy in Full Measure," by President Belle S. Spafford and "And What of the Promise?" by Counselor Marianne C. Sharp were published in the November issue of the Magazine, and President Smith's address "Living to Enjoy the Blessings of the Lord" is featured in this issue.

"Lean Your Ear This Way"

Iris W. Schow

ADELE Marlowe was not conscious of it, as she hurried purposefully from the elevator to the street, but the mechanically distorted Christmas carol, the fat, gleaming bows hanging from the holly wreaths, and the jostlings of the shoppers were all in harmony with her mood of overwhelming exultation and well-being. The air was less crisp than it had been when she went in, and a few large snowflakes were descending reluctantly. A newly changed record blared out discordantly from the loudspeaker above the First Bank. It was softened abruptly, so that the chimes fell on the ear gently and separately, Adele thought, as if an angel picked out the tune with one finger, note by note, on little silver bells.

"Adeste Fideles" this was as far as she could get without the aid of English— "joyful and triumphant."

"Joyful and triumphant," that was it precisely. For, now that Dr. Copeland had assured her that she was justified in harboring her wonderful hope, she would hurry to tell Roy about it. She would go right into Freem's and interrupt him at his work, even if it wasn't a critical emergency. After all, she never had gone into the store to see Roy, although he had worked there for almost two months. Roy didn't believe in mixing domesticity with business. That wasn't the way to get ahead. Well, neither did she, but this was different. She was so keyed up that she couldn't go home and wait until he came out on the seven-thirty bus. That would take too long. Merely walking to Freem's was taking almost too long.

The glow in Adele's eyes, coupled with the suggestion of a smile that lifted the corners of her generous mouth, compelled answering smiles from the women she passed. A soprano's recorded singing filled the streets now, and the words seeped into Adele's consciousness: The hopes and fears of all the years Are met in thee to-night....

HOW they had hoped for a really good position for Roy, during these early years of their marriage! It had come at last—assistant manager at Freem's, exactly the opening he had wanted ever since he had finished college, the very position where his excellent training in business would assure his advancement, and the murmur in his heart would hinder him as little as possible. And now their other hope, dearer still....

A school group had begun singing over the speaking system: Ho! Ho! Hol! Who wouldn't go? Who wouldn't go, indeed?

The gleam in Adele's eyes softened. In six years from now—no, seven—what sort of little lad or girl might be up there caroling with the others? This day really was too wonderful!

Adele pulled open the door and entered Freem's Department Store. She would ask the first clerk she saw where to find Mr. Marlowe. "LEAN Your EAR THIS WAY"

Anyone who worked there would know the new assistant manager.

The department store Santa had paused in his descent of the broad stairway to wave to the small girl and boy who bounced expectantly at the foot, flanked by a pair of amused parents.

As she approached, Adele watched Santa Claus wave exaggeratedly, then descend slowly. He created a grand illusion of genuine old age when he eased himself down on a lower step and seated a child on each knee. The girl's great blue eyes and small white teeth sparkled vivaciously, while domestic prattle about "a real little stove and some very tiny kettles and pans" rushed from her lips. The little boy waited gravely, as becomes an oldish child, but his dark eyes burned with an eagerness which his silence could not discount. Just so, in three or four years, Adele's child would pour out its impatient hopes. That would be a special moment for her, for the child, and even for Santa, no doubt; for then Roy might even be the manager. Adele pictured herself, really tastefully turned out, indulgently hovering close by, admired and idealized by every employee in the store.

She almost sprinted up the stairs, moved briskly through the latest in "Everything to Beautify the Home," and arrived at the little office window, breathing rapidly.
"I'd like to speak to Mr. Roy Marlowe," she told the girl who appeared at the window.
"I'm sorry," said the girl, in the tone and manner of a telephone operator giving one the time of day. "Mr. Marlowe is no longer with us."
Adele turned away. The great thing was not to show how much and intimately it mattered, to look as if she might be Roy's second cousin's sister-in-law from Washington County, dropping in to say, "Hello."

How long had Roy been "no longer with them" at Freen's? Why? Where was he spending the time from nine A.M. until six-thirty P.M. each day? If he had quit his job to accept a better one, he would have told her. What was he doing right now? Hunting desperately for another good job, she supposed.

She was back downstairs now, approaching the door. There sat Santa Claus still in the great armchair, chuckling and nodding, while another pair of doting parents heard their little dove make her Christmas requests. What a spectacle for a grown man to have to make of himself in order to gain a livelihood!

"And a dollie, and a dollie bed, and a buggy . . ." That blue-eyed little girl on his lap was enumerating everything she had ever seen or heard of.
Adele hastened on toward the door. There would be some relief in getting outside again, in spite of the falling snow, if only the crowd didn't mill about so. She must get herself in hand. Even though she had just been toppled over by a stunning blow, she reminded herself there was no excuse for lashing out at the whole human scene, including Santa Claus and innocent childhood.

Although she had not exactly decided to go there, Adele was hurrying toward the employment agency. It was not the loss of Roy's position that was so upsetting. It was not knowing what Roy was going through, how he was spending his days, and how long or deeply he had been worrying. She had been too busy with her own hopes lately, or he never could have kept up a bluff before her. Not with that frank, trustworthy expression of his!

Waiting for the traffic light to change, Adele brushed diligently at the film of snow on the shoulders of her trim brown coat, unmindful that she still had nearly a block to go. Well, one thing was certain, she decided. It was not through any fault of his own that Roy had lost that job. He always got along well with others. Why, his air of willingness to please was the first striking characteristic that she had noticed about him. It was almost as obvious as his busy way of smoothing back his hair with one hand, in an attempt to appear at ease, whenever he felt self-conscious.

The corners of Adele's mouth curved upward momentarily, as she moved forward with the stream of pedestrians. Activity was at a surprisingly low ebb at the employment agency. Adele had the almost instantaneous attention of a shrewdly efficient young woman, who asked crisply, "May I help you?"

"Want—that is, I came to—I was just looking for someone, thank you."

Adele turned and left swiftly. Whatever had she gone blundering in there for? She certainly didn't intend to rush from place to place inquiring about her husband, as if she were hounding him down. That could only serve to make them both appear ridiculous. The best thing she could do was to go quietly home. She started for the bus stop at the corner.

Should she let Roy know how she had learned that he was no longer at Freem's, or should she wait until he told her? Should she tell him about the baby now? Probably not. It would only add to his burdens—make everything harder for him, and he must be nearly wild with worry now. But wouldn't he be able to tell that she knew about the job, the minute he saw her face?

Were they going to keep that nerve-jangling music grinding out all day? "Silent Night..."

If only there could be a little silence, maybe she could think at least one of her problems through to a sensible conclusion. No wonder she had dashed into the employment agency without any idea of what to do when she got there.

Dele could see her bus approaching when she remembered the satin comforters she had on lay-away at Stewart's for Mom and Mother Marlowe. Whatever had made her pay a deposit on anything so expensive? The minute she felt a little affluent, there she went! Well, she must get over to Stewart's right now and see if she could talk that elderly Mrs. Lee, the saleswoman who seemed to like her, into letting her apply the 'deposit on some other purchases. Lace vanity sets would make nice Christmas gifts for their mothers, and she would be needing a lot of small things for the baby. By adding a little more money to the deposit, she could take care of Christmas and make a real start on her layette. That was, she could if they were understanding about the deposit.

It was dear and considerate of Roy to spare her the worry about his job. But actually it wasn't fair to let her run the risk of sticking out her neck even farther in the latter of paying deposits on nonessentials. Adele's limbs went sickeningly weak at the thought of how near she had come to really splurging with a down payment on the beautiful combination radio-phonograph which she knew that Roy longed to possess. What luck that she had happened to decide to think it over a little longer!

Well, the pressing need was to plan exactly what to say to make that nice little Mrs. Lee understand about the deposit. She mustn't let herself in for any more incoherent floundering. To plan ahead was what brought real results. But where was Roy spending his days? If only there were some way of knowing....

She was getting so tired. Carol after carol had beaten upon her ears. Two women approached, arm in arm, while they spoke into each other's faces. "But Aunt Millie serves so much good home cooking, I'd say a nice little pickle fork would dispose of her." They bumped Adele from their path without a glance or a break in their conversation. They didn't even need any nice little fork to dispose of me, thought Adele, struggling to maintain her footing. Though she had barely bypassed the entrance to Stewart's, she had to force her way back against the current of pedestrians.

ONCE indoors, Adele paused before the first mirror she noticed. A check-up on her appearance certainly must precede any attempt to undo her error in judgment, she decided. There was still something trim about her brown coat, considering that this was its second season. Just a little matter of brushing off a bit of snow, straightening her hat, tucking back a tendril of hair, and placing a judicious dash of powder, and she would look appealing enough. That is, she would if she could suppress that worried expression.

Stewart's evidently provided their own musical atmosphere. Somewhere a phonograph with a rather good tone was playing "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town." "Better not pout," thought Adele, starting for the elevators. She'd wait for one, if she had to. Even one flight of stairs seemed too much of a climb for her now.

Two small boys were talking with Santa this time. Poor little fellows, undoubtedly they had no suspicion of it, but this was probably the last heart-to-heart chat they would ever hold with a department store St. Nick, Adele decided from their large size. She paused to watch, lips parted with faintly smiling interest.

Hip boots for wading, of all things! A pity they didn't have their parents in tow; still, important matters had a way of getting into every conversation, in a home....

And suddenly Adele saw that Santa, giving a start, had laid a (Continued on page 832)

"Happy Grandmothers" Enjoy An Entertaining Hobby

TWENTY years ago Mary Stevenson, now the chorister in LeGrand Ward (Salt Lake City) Relief Society, found a unique way to bring cheer and happiness to people who were ill or homebound. Being a skillful player of the mandolin and harmonica, she decided to organize a "good cheer" group, which included from the very first Fannie Terry and Mayna Mathews. Six years ago Effie Yates was asked to join the group. The other member, Alfhild Mork, a Norwegian convert to the Church, who plays the guitar, whistles, and yodels, was not present when the above photograph was taken.

At first the group took their high-hearted music into individual homes, playing for birthdays, weddings, and other special occasions, but their unusual entertainment became so much in demand that they have played in hundreds of Latter-day Saint wards, in many other churches, over several radio stations, and they have received numerous requests for performances in every state of the Union. Their contribution to Utah's Centennial celebration was outstanding and every governor present at the 1947 convention invited the "Happy Grandmothers" to visit his state.

Their repertoire includes gay dances, the schottische, varsovienna, polka music, and many European and American folk songs and dances. The women wear authentic costumes which are copies of pioneer gowns and bonnets of a hundred years ago.

Each of these musicians has made a unique contribution. Fanny Terry bought her first guitar forty-five years ago while her husband was on a mission. When her son, Captain Elmer Terry, left for the Second World War, he asked the musical grandmothers to keep his mother playing until he returned. Captain Terry never returned, but his mother is still playing and making people happy. She is now seventy-six years old.

Mayna Mathews is an expert nurse who has played the guitar and harmonica for many years. Effie Yates was past fifty years old before she took a music lesson. She now plays the guitar and harmonica.

All of these women have been active in Relief Society work for many years. Sister Terry and Sister Mathews are visiting teachers and Sister Yates is first counselor in Emigration Stake Relief Society.

Then Came Christmas

ABBIE Walker stood in the doorway of her small adobe home and looked with a disgruntled expression at the sunny landscape before her. To the south, at the foot of a brownish-gray, low-lying hill, ran the Virgin River, gleaming like a broad silver ribbon in the sunshine. To the west rose the Black Ridge, with its scanty covering of creosote bushes whose dingy green only slightly relieved the glistening black of its lava covering. This ridge ended in a point at the northwest of the valley where it almost rubbed noses with the point of the Red Hill, so called because of its red sandstone formation.

This hill seemed to diffuse a glow that made the valley warm, even though it was just a week until Christmas. Generally Abbie appreciated the kindly warmth, but today it struck her as being out of place in a season that should be cold and sparkling with snow. Frankly, she told herself, she was homesick—tired of the whole Dixie mission, its scanty food, brackish water, and alkali soil. Why had they been called way down here just as they were getting comfortably settled in Salt Lake City? Even there she had been homesick for her old home on the wave-washed coast of Nova Scotia—hungry for the sound of the waves and for a view of those mountains whose snowy covering brought the pines and firs into beautiful relief.

But in the years that she lived in Salt Lake City, she had learned to love the beautiful Wasatch Mountains, ever changing their color with the seasons. Under their protecting watchfulness she had grown to womanhood, had found her mate, and a few years later been married to him. Together they planted fruit trees, shrubs, and flowers around their little home and then when the fruit trees were ready to yield their first and much longed-for harvest, had come the call to go to the Dixie mission.

For a few days it had seemed to Abbie and her husband Charles that the very foundation of their little world was shattered. But they were pioneers in the strictest sense of the word, so again with eyes and hearts hopefully turned toward the future, they sold their home for a wagon and team, packed up their remaining possessions, including their two little boys Charley and Joe, and once more took leave of friends and home.

Abbie had thought that in Salt Lake they had known hardship and want, but today as she looked back over the years they had spent in Dixie, she wondered how she could ever have thought such a thing. For it was just a week until Christmas and not a cent of money in the house to buy such needed things as shoes and hats, and Christmas presents were out of the question.

Abbie had never been one to complain and tears came rarely to her brave, clear-visioned eyes. Even Mother Nature, she thought bitterly, refused to adorn these barren hills with beautifying trees and shrubs—Page 809—and also failed to clothe their winter nakedness with charitable snow. Well, she knew that in far-off Nova Scotia and dear Salt Lake City the snowflakes were making of the mountains and valleys a fitting and purified setting for the celebration of the birthday of him whose life would always be a symbol of purity and cleanliness.

THEN the tears, unbidden, rushed to her eyes, blinding her for the minute so that she did not know that her husband was near until he spoke to her. "Why, Abbie, dear, what can be the matter, has anything happened to you or the children? Have you had bad news?"

"No, Charles," she replied, "nothing has happened, but I am homesick for a real snowy Christmas like we used to have back home in Salt Lake. I know it seems foolish but it just doesn't seem like Christmas. Just look, the grass is green along the ditch bank and the blackbirds sing as if it were spring."

"And a mighty lucky thing it is for us to have it mild like this," answered Charles. "Fancy me wading around in the snow and mud in shoes like these," he added, showing shoes much the worse for wear. "Yours aren't any better and I noticed this morning that the children's shoes won't last much longer either."

"That's another thing I was feeling bad about when you came," said Abbie. "I hate to send the children to Sunday School. I just can't bear to have them go so shabby. If we could only have some new clothes and shoes for Christmas I wouldn't ask for anything else."

"I'm so sorry, Abbie. I thought I was doing so well," said Charles, for the blacksmithing I have done for the neighbors, but Gus wanted me to take some beef on his bill and Henry wanted to pay molasses on his, so of course I took it and glad to get it too, even though we could make good use of a little cash. But cheer up, dear, something's bound to come our way. You know we have never been without some kind of shoes and clothing and I think we never shall."

"Don't you ever get homesick for England, Charles? You always seem so cheerful that I often wonder at the encouragement you find with our hard lot here in Dixie."

"I'm afraid I do sometimes, Abbie. In our hot, dry, merciless summers, my eyes fairly ache for a sight of the grass-covered hills of England, its dewy meadows and hedgerows. Then again I feel like I can never be happy until I once more hear a nightingale singing in the moonlight. But when winter comes and I think of the English fog and the gray, damp, sunless days, I am glad to be in dry, sunny Dixie, where the white plague that haunts England is not known. So you see, dear, every loss has some compensation, and if we haven't good shoes we have good stockings, thanks to your busy fingers."

That evening Abbie took down her workbox from a high shelf. The box had been her mother's and one of Joe's very few household treasures she had brought from her old home. Her mother had died on the plains of cholera, so it wasn't any wonder that Abbie prized the box above her other possessions and kept it out of the children's reach. But tonight she was so busy setting up a red mitten that was part of Joe's Christmas that she did not notice that little Charley was rummaging in the workbox until he called, "Mother, look, what made this little straight crack in the end of your workbox?"

NOT getting an immediate reply, he stuck an inquiring fingernail into the crack. The crack widened a little. Again he pried and could see that the whole end could be raised about an inch above the level of the box. Just then his mother turned to investigate his silence and saw what had happened. With a cry she picked up the workbox.

"Oh, Charley, you have broken my box. How ever did you do it?" She started toward her husband with it, saying, "Just look, Charles, the boy has broken my mother's workbox. Do you think that you could mend it?"

In handing it to him the box tipped, and before their astonished eyes, out fell—no, not buttons nor thread, but five sovereigns!

"Well, bless my soul," exclaimed Charles, "where did they come from, five sovereigns, worth five dollars apiece?"

"Out of the box somewhere," said Abbie excitedly, "but just where is a mystery to me."

Charles took the box, examined it a minute or two, then cried out, "Look here, Abbie, the mystery is solved. The box has a double bottom and the end is made so that it can be pulled up. The small slit in the end of the box was put there to use just as Charley used it to pull up the end so that valuables or money could be hidden in the space between the false and real bottoms of the box. This dry Dixie climate has warped the box so that this small crack opened the secret door, visible to Charley's sharp eyes, thank goodness!"

"Thank goodness! Was ever money more welcome! Now we can all have new shoes for Christmas, and maybe something else besides," said Abbie joyfully. "And it's going to seem like Christmas after all!"

Presently, Charles, who had been looking thoughtfully at the box, asked, "Abbie, what do you know about the history of this workbox?"

"Only this," replied Abbie, "my aunt gave it to my mother years ago when she was just a girl back in Nova Scotia. When mother died on the plains coming to the Valley, my aunt asked father to let her have the box as a keepsake. Father gave it to her and she kept it until she died a year or two after we came to Dixie, then Uncle Robert gave it to me. But how and when the money was put in there I haven't the slightest idea."

"It would be interesting to know about the money got into the box," said Charles, "but not nearly so interesting as the fact that it got out."

A week later Abbie Walker again stood in the doorway of her small adobe home, her husband Charles beside her. Together they looked over the sunny landscape before them. It was Christmas morning and there was a frosty tang in the air, but the sun shone from a sky as clear and blue as spring. The children, happy in new shoes and mittens, and the proud possessors of china mugs filled with "store" candy, were playing in the yard. Abbie watched them, smiling happily. Presently she looked up at her husband and said, "My, I'm glad it isn't snowing."

It would just ruin my shoes!"

It is Christmas time, merry and joyous. What sweet recollections are recalled to mind on this happy occasion. Old folks and young join in gay pastimes, and it is not only a season of rejoicing, but of refreshing, bodily and mentally. For a few hours, at least, peace is the sentiment of all honest hearts, and harshness and ingratitude are banished.�Aunt Em.

UINTAH STAKE: Minutes of the second conference of the Relief Society of the Uintah Stake of Zion, which convened in the Ashley meeting house, Sept. 2nd, 1888, Pres. Sarah Pope presiding. "I am pleased to be with my sisters here to-day; it does me good to see everybody looking so comfortable and so well clothed. Thirty years ago the people in Utah did not have as much as they have to-day; if we had a homemade dress on we were just as happy and thankful as we are to-day, and perhaps more so, because it was harder to get it; to-day there is plenty of everything in our midst, but do we appreciate these blessings? If not we should."�Ada Longhurst, Secretary

CHRISTMAS HYMN
Ring out, glad bells, your sweetest chimes!
Ring out the glad refrain!
Peace be on earth, good will to man,
Ring out, ring out again!
Peal forth, sweet bells, in midnight hour,
Good will, good will to man!

Amen, amen, amen.

THE CHILDREN'S CHRISTMAS: All the children are on tiptoe with expectancy just before Christmas time. What would Christmas be in fact if it were not for the children? It seems as though Christmas was CHILDREN'S DAY and so it ought to be, for it is celebrated in honor of the most royal Babe that was ever born upon the earth, our blessed Savior, whose coming was heralded by hosts of angels singing and a new star arose in the east, and there was great rejoicing in heaven as well as upon the earth, when the heavenly choirs joined in the anthem that ushered in the new born king.�Aunt Em.

A LAMENT
O, the sweet yesterdays fled from the heart,
Have they a morrow?
Here we stood, ere we parted so close side by side;
Two lives that thus part are as ships that divide,
When moment on moment there rushes between
The one and the other, a sea;
Oh, never can fall from the days that have been
A gleam on the years that shall be!

EMMA LUCY GATES, wife of Elder Albert E. Bowen of the Council of the Twelve, and granddaughter of President Brigham Young, was signally honored by the citizens of Utah and outstanding musical friends when more than 2,500 music lovers gathered at a testimonial in the Assembly Hall, Temple Square, October 25, 1948. A specially selected chorus and forty members of the Utah Symphony opened the program with Bach's "Magnificat," the work in which Mrs. Bowen made her debut in Berlin in 1900. It was the audience itself which "commanded" the once great star of European and American concert and opera stages to close the testimonial with the singing of the role of Violetta in the "disintegration" scene from the third act of Verdi's "La Traviata" which had just been presented as closing selection with many former students of Mrs. Bowen signing as soloists and members of the chorus. An appreciative and well-earned tribute which touched the hearts of the audience was paid Mrs. Bowen by her accomplished friend Becky Almond. The response by Mrs. Bowen was in perfect taste. The entire proceeds of the testimonial were given to the Utah Building Fund.

IN St. George, Utah, a drugstore is owned and operated entirely by women.

JUST off the press is a book of poems, beautifully bound in maroon and gold, titled Wayside Whispering. The author is Grace M. Candland, well-known Utah poet, whose work has frequently appeared in Church magazines.

IN little stone houses on a fifty-five acre reservation in central Arizona live eight Indian families who constitute the Yavapai tribe. They are governed by Viola Jimulla, sixty-seven years old, the only woman in the United States who rules an Indian tribe. However, a three-man council can outvote her.

IN Bristol, England, at a Methodist conference, women speakers opposed a resolution that women should be accepted as ministers.

MARVA BANKS LINDSAY of Salt Lake City has been appointed to a national post in the field of education. She will serve on the national committee on teacher preparation and professional standards of the National Education Association, and will live in Washington, D. C., during her three-year term of service.

"The Heavens Declare the Glory"
The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork (Psalm 19:1).

WHEN the seasons are fulfilled and Christmas comes again, we think of the story of the Wise Men of the East and the sign in the heavens that guided them across the mountains and the deserts to the manger at Bethlehem. Christmas is truly a time for considering the stars and all the "handywork" of God.

For centuries the stars have been to the earthbound a symbol of that which endures in beauty and serenity. Today, in the midst of much tumult, in the confusion and conflict of ideas and ideologies, we turn with a spiritual yearning to that which seems steadfast, to eternal patterns, and to everlasting law.

Many travelers have observed that the stars which are visible in the Holy Land seem more beautiful than those in any other place in all the world. This may, perhaps, be explained by the fact that Palestine is largely desert country, rifted by mountains and cut by gullies. And in contrast to this wilderness which is the land, the stars shine with utmost brilliance and they seem to be very near to earth.

Above the hills of the East appeared the new star, a fulfillment of prophecy, a guide, and a beacon. The Magi followed that star with implicit faith akin to that high spiritual dedication with which many in succeeding ages have followed the gospel of which the star was a symbol. And many have thought of the message that Jesus brought to the earth as being like unto the stars in its steadfast shining.

It has been said that the heavens are an open book in which the stars are golden letters. Yet there is much that men, without revelation, cannot understand. For in the star is written the story of how the worlds were made and set in place. The Prophet Joseph Smith has told us that:
The earth rolls upon her wings, and the sun giveth his light by day, and the moon giveth her light by night, and the stars also give their light, as they roll upon their wings in their glory, in the midst of the power of God.

Unto what shall I liken these kingdoms, that ye may understand them? Behold, all these are kingdoms, and any man who has seen any or the least of these hath seen God moving in his majesty and power (D&C 88:45-47).
In this time and in this place may we be comforted by the symbol of eternal patterns which the stars reveal, and let us rest assured that more knowledge will be given us in that time and place which God has set for our knowing.
Is not God in the height of heaven? And behold the height of the stars, how high they are! And thou sayest, How doth God know? Can he judge through the dark clouds? Thick clouds are a covering to him . . . and he walketh in the circuit of heaven (Job 22:12-14).

Priscilla L. Evans and Florence G. Smith Released from the General Board

It is with keen regret and with an appreciation for the fine work done by Priscilla L. Evans and Florence G. Smith on the general board of Relief Society, that the general board has accepted the requests made by these sisters that they be released. Sister Evans' resignation became effective as of October 15, 1948, and Sister Smith's on October 20, 1948.

Sister Evans was appointed to the general board in June 1941 during the administration of President Amy Brown Lyman. She came endowed with unusual creative ability and was qualified by training to give outstanding service in matters pertaining to legal questions. From her previous position as mission Relief Society president of the Eastern States Mission she also brought to her position an understanding of Relief Society work, with particular insight into the needs and requirements of mission Relief Societies. She has fulfilled the manifold requirements devolving upon her as a member of the general board with distinction. Sister Evans will be long remembered as the creator and writer of the March 1947 Sunday night Radio Society program "A Story in Granite and Bronze," as well as for her co-operation in writing and impressive delivery of "From the Shadow of a Dream to the Sunlight of Promise" which recognized the stakes and missions in the Building Fund Program at the recent annual general Relief Society conference. She has also served Relief Society members and friends and recognition for herself and the organization during the past nine years through holding the position of corresponding secretary of the National Council of Women.

While Sister Evans has found it advisable to be relieved of the pressing and exacting duties of general board work, she will no doubt continue to give freely of her great ability and talents, as she may be called upon, both to her Church and State to which she has always been so generous in rendering outstanding service in the past.

SISTER Florence G. Smith was called to the general board in November 1946 during the administration of President Belle S. Spafford. She brought to her general board duties an understanding of Relief Society work growing out of many years' experience in presiding over the Relief Societies of the South African, California, and Northwestern States Missions. This service has made Sister Smith very cognizant of the differing conditions under which Relief Society functions in various parts of the world. In carrying out her general board assignment, she has manifested a willingness to serve and an appreciation of the opportunity to serve, coupled with a gentleness of spirit and a love for the women of the Church. Her services will remain to bless Relief Society.

She has now been called to serve as matron of the Bee Hive House for young women, an appointment which will be quite exacting but to which she will bring her wholehearted attention and splendid gifts of graciousness.

In Memoriam�Alice Merrill Horne

ALICE MERRILL HORNE, beloved member of the Relief Society general board (1902-1916), passed away October 7, 1948, at the age of eighty. Through her mother Bathsheba Smith Merrill, Sister Horne was a granddaughter of George A. Smith (cousin of the Prophet Joseph and First Counselor to President Brigham Young) and Bathsheba W. Smith, a beautiful and gracious woman, fourth general president of Relief Society. President George Albert Smith is a cousin of Alice Merrill Horne.

Sister Horne was also blessed with a rich spiritual and intellectual heritage from her father, Clarence Merrill. Alice Merrill, wife of George W. Horne, was richly endowed with beauty and strength of mind and personality. Whatever her capable hands touched blossomed with enduring symmetry. She served her State as an active member of the Legislature and in numerous other positions of civic trust and responsibility.

Sister Horne's work on the general board covered a wide range of activities, including the chairmanship of the Public Health Committee which established a series of sanitary milk stations in Salt Lake City and accomplished many other reforms vital to the welfare of mothers and children. She traveled widely as a representative of Relief Society, attending the International Council of Women in Berlin in 1904 and the meetings of the National Council of Women in 1902 and 1909, the Worlds Fair in 1915, and many other meetings of importance.

In the field of art, Sister Horne rendered invaluable service. She made many beautiful designs for Relief Society programs, bulletins, and other publications. A series of lessons which she prepared was published under the title Devotees and Their Shrines, a Handbook of Utah Art (1914). The book was adopted as a text in the schools of Utah and has been widely read, still maintaining its place as a most inspiring reference book. The preface, a masterpiece in prose, expresses Sister Horne's life-long philosophy of accomplishment: "Every spirit which enters mortality comes stamped with infinity�with a power to reach out and grow illimitably.... Listen to the infinite of your soul when it calls."

A gifted artist herself, Sister Horne devoted much of her life to the encouragement and welfare of other artists. She supported all groups and individuals interested in poetry, music, and cultural development of every type. Her life was broad and beautiful; she lived fully and richly and helped all who knew her to partake of the same bounty. She leaves an able and gifted family, two sons who are doctors, and three talented and lovely daughters, who are carrying forward much of their mother's unfinished work.

Alice Merrill Horne will be long remembered for her kind nursing of the sick, her innumerable kindnesses as a neighbor, and her untiring devotion as a friend. Many remember her precious guardianship of pioneer ideals and skills. She will also be remembered as a woman richly endowed who gave liberally of all that she possessed.

Relief Society women who attended the annual general Relief Society conference, held just prior to Sister Horne's death, will remember her as she sat on the stand as an honored woman who had labored long and faithfully for the advancement of Relief Society work in all its many phases—a woman of whom we all may well be proud and appreciative that she has lived among us.

New Serial to Begin in January

THE first chapter of "Joanna," a new serial by Margery Stockseth Stewart, will begin in the January issue of theThe story relates the courageous efforts of a young widow to give her four children the best in life. The character portrayal is excellent, and the entire story is beautifully written. The author is the wife of Russell Stewart and the mother of two children. She is of Norwegian descent and has received a Citizenship Award from the Salt Lake City Junior Chamber of Commerce given for outstanding accomplishments of descendants of foreign-born Americans. A gifted writer of both stories and poetry, Mrs. Stewart has won many prizes. In 1946 her story "The Return" placed first in the Relief Society Short Story Contest. Many of her poems have appeared in the Magazine, including several frontispiece poems. Mrs. Stewart is a member of several literary organizations: the League of Utah Writers, the Barnacles (a Salt Lake City story-writing group), and she recently organized a chapter of the National Writers' Club. Her Church work has been varied, with service in dramatics in the M.I.A., being particularly outstanding.

WINTER

Alice R. Rich

North wind, like unleashed fury, comes from bare and sodden hills,
And sapless, naked trees and shrubs creak with its biting chills;
Gray, lumbering clouds roll ominously, without turmoil or sound,
Then loose their mist to spread a skirt of crystals on the ground.

Aprons for Christmas

Alice Willardson

IT seems only yesterday that we had our annual "Day with Longfellow." I mean the day we spend each fall in the canyon. We sit on a hillside in the warm sunshine absorbing the quiet and glorious color while we take turns in reading Longfellow's poems. It has become a sort of personal holiday to keep the autumn from slipping past us.

This year the maple leaves were so colorful that with the sunlight on them they actually seemed to give off light and warmth like fire, fire which does not leap and fade but remains steadily brilliant. I am glad, too, for the pine boughs and the cedar berries, for today the sky is gray and the wind is furious. Dead leaves are blown carelessly against the windowpanes; the fire in the fireplace feels good. The smell of the pine boughs burning in the grate is so pungent that I can close my eyes and see the Christmas tree. I can see all the gifts and wrappings scattered everywhere and hear all the happy noises and excitement. It won't be long till Christmas! You know!

This year I think I'll have an apron Christmas! This morning the sewing room looks very cozy and inviting. And just last week I heard Vina say she didn't have a single good apron. She likes one that is big and serviceable. Kate likes them to be sort of pretty and serviceable, too. I have a pattern with a ruffle on the shoulders, pinafore style, that will give it a festive appearance. She likes red, too, and it will sort of go with her kitchen. Anne always loves yellow and I have those scraps of flowered dimity which will combine with either white or yellow organdy beautifully.

That's one thing about giving aprons; they can be so individual. And they are within the pocketbook of the giver and always welcomed by the receiver. There are so many styles, colors, and materials—aprons for all occasions and all ages. Apron styles like those in illustrations No. 1 and No. 2 will cover your whole dress from danger of splashings. Made from percale, and minus the ruffles, they will be very practical. If made from dimity, they wear exceptionally well, too, and are so pretty to protect your nice dress while you serve the Sunday dinner. With the ruffles, or a touch of applique, they are pretty as well as serviceable. Notice the back in picture No. 2.

If you are tired of washing and untangling apron strings, this button back is very neat and effective. And if you want to save ironing, leave off the ruffles and just trim with braid, bias tape, or a combination material. There are many other styles for anyone who wants an apron to really work in, one that covers the dress completely. Wrap-around styles are the handiest and most useful aprons for the busy housewife.

Next, there are all the lovely little serving aprons—aprons as pretty and dainty as flowers. These can be No. 4 made from lawn, dimity, organdy, dotted Swiss (and by the way, if you want a very fragile, dainty looking apron that will really stand many washings, you can't beat dotted Swiss). There are three pictures of serving aprons illustrated here, Nos. 3, 4, and 5, which can be made from combinations of materials. They allow you to use scraps of quite a variety of shapes and sizes. Often when you have to use your own ingenuity to make something of the material you already have on hand, the result is much prettier than if you had bought special material and used a commercial pattern. A combination of materials is usually prettier than just one material, and you can use old aprons for cutting patterns for new ones.

No. 6

APRON No. 6 gives a suggestion for using applique trimming to form the pocket. Applique is used also to trim No. 7. An excellent idea for getting flowers, fruit, etc., for your applique work is to cut them out from some of the many colorful materials with large and distinct designs.

Aprons may be effectively trimmed with ruffles of self material (as illustrated in No. 8) or they may be accented with ruffles of a contrasting color. A very lovely decorative apron was made from white organdy as illustrated in No. 9. Colorful flowers cut from percale were inserted under the hem. The hem was turned over the flowers and fastened down on the right side by a dainty featherstitch. The same motif was also sewed under the organdy pocket. The flowers under the organdy not only made the work less inclined to ravel, and more easily ironed, but they also gave it a sort of ethereal, fairylike touch so suitable to organdy.

No. 10

There are no gifts more acceptable to both mothers and daughters than the lovely pinafores illustrated in No. 10. Make the "daughter" apron out of material just like mother's.

There are all types of trimmings, too. Braids and laces of all kinds are on the market now. There are all kinds of handwork, from blanket or featherstitching to lovely embroidery done in silk.

And, if you feel so inclined, there are now available fabric paints which are suitable and absolutely washfast. I have a painted tea towel which washes right along with my dish towels regularly.

If you are looking for something really different, there are all the aprons for special work, like clothespin aprons and sewing aprons. I even got an idea for a man's apron the other day as I watched my son priming the car. Why not make an apron of heavy, waterproof material, containing pockets for the sponge, the cleaner, the wax, the chamois, etc.? Might save a lot of hunting for them. This apron could be hung in the basement after it was used and it would be ready for use again the next time, complete with all the equipment.

Maybe I'm planning a gift that would be more welcomed by the man than by my gift that way, it's an idea!

Questing Lights
Belle Watson Anderson

CHAPTER 8 (Conclusion)

When a Scotchman really makes up his mind, things begin to happen. That's why Margaret was just hanging up the curtains in the cabin when the Missionary walked in.

"Andrew!" She hopped down from the ladder. "We weren't expecting you so soon. How did you manage it?"

Andrew spoke impetuously, "Margaret, when a man's in love, he says to the whole world, 'Step aside, and let me pass!' Well, here I am! Nothing will ever stop me if you are willing, Margaret, could you learn to love me?"

"Learn to love you?" Margaret stood silent for 4 minutes, then laughed joyously. "You see, man, I am far ahead of you. Like Rachel of old, I have waited seven long years for this, with not the encouragement she received, either," her face grew grave as she relived the years in her thoughts.

"You mean—Oh! Margaret, it is unbelievable." He took her tenderly in his arms and kissed her. "Darling, I will spend a lifetime to say I'm grateful."

The bairns outside heard voices and came in on the run.

"If only mother could see her bairns today, she wouldna' worry," Andrew prophesied. "Margaret, how can I pay you?"

"I love the bairns, Andrew." He took them all in his arms together. "Oh! You are all so marvelous. What a homecoming! I'm a very happy man."

If Andrew had put time and effort into his Missionary work, Margaret had been just as busy in the care of the bairns and the wool. In Tooele she had been thrifty and saved her money. She loved to work in the soft, fine, white wool, and to the cards, she had added a spinning wheel and a loom for weaving carpet and tugs. She had even purchased a jig for knitting socks and stockings. She looked forward to owning a home of her own someday on the millrace, where she would install a large loom for weaving cloth.

Linsey-woolsey was very popular. The loom could be rigged to a water wheel in the big creek. Many bats of many hanks of yarn, white and beautiful colors, for knitting, carpets, come out when she had too much to do, Kathleen and Mother had helped her. So the loom clicked and clattered, and the spinning wheel hummed and away the hours while Andrew had been away preaching the gospel.

In the cabin Margaret had also put glass in the windows, changed the mud roof for homemade shingles, laid carpet on the floors, and planted many roses and walnut trees around the home. At once, by Margaret had also put glass in the windows, changed the mud roof for homemade shingles, laid carpet on the floors, and planted many roses and walnut trees around the home.

ANDREW wanted to be married at once, but Margaret wanted a beautiful wedding. At the store when they could not pay her in cash, she got many yards of lovely material, and sometimes whole bolts of lace. She wanted some bonny and dainty things for herself and for her home.

In Scotland the girls began early to make and plan their trousseaux. Kathleen and Mother were wonderful sewers, and with their help, they all could have beautiful dresses, and she could have some lovely things for her home. So she left the spinning room in the cabin for a sewing room at Mother's for a time.

They baked a wedding cake, fruit puddings, and shortbread, everything that was essential for a very wonderful wedding. And while they worked they talked.

Kathleen and Mother told Margaret of the time when Andrew had raised grain on the river bottoms and timbered in the forest and that when he received word of Jane's marriage he hadn't gone back to the fields or to the forest.

"Yes, he was hard hit for a time, my darling, but his mission has cured him of all that," Mother said.

Margaret remembered the "Jane look," as she had called it on the plains when Andrew would sit for a long time and look far beyond the camp. She had known he was dreaming of Jane. That was all passed now; she did not need to worry about Jane. Margaret knew now that Andrew loved her. Yes, Andrew loved her but why did he not go back to the land and to the forest? The wool was her job. Andrew's was the harvest and grain. She thought of a plan.

She was curious, and wanted to go to the river bottoms with Andrew Rumgay. She suggested to him that they take a horseback ride the next Saturday afternoon. She was tired of being shut up in the sewing room; she wanted to get out in the sunshine.

Andrew thought it was a wonderful idea, so he brought Gypsy and Pinto up to Mother's for their ride.

They slowly walked their horses to the canyon. Resplendence was beautiful at this time of year. A tapestry in every tone and color of the autumn had been hung from the ceiling of the mountains. Farther up in the hills, vesper campfires were bright burning. The river sang low, sacred melodies for the rituals of the harvest time.

They tied their horses to some maple brush and walked into the great silent woodlands. Higher up in the mountains they heard the loud crash of falling trees and the wild cry of timber.

"The more trees that come down in the forest the more homes go up in the valleys. Many people are coming to the mountains to find homes every year, Margaret. They must find them. Soon I must return to the forests."

They walked back to their horses, mounted, and when they reached the river road Margaret touched the reins with her quirt, and they were off to a gallop towards the bottoms. At the crossing they reined their horses. Margaret was off Pinto in a jiffy. They stood almost speechless in the beauty of the valley and listened to the wild singing of the stream. They found a boulder on the edge of the creek and sat down.

ANDREW was particularly interested in the songs of the stream. He smiled.

Can you imagine anything so far-fetched as to interpret these very happy roundelays of music into weird and solemn dirges?
"Oh, it's so peaceful here. Wouldn't it be wonderful to live out here? You could farm and I could card wool. When you harvested I could bind and gather the sheaves."
"When the Indians become more friendly, Margaret, we will build our home in the bottoms." Andrew arose and led Margaret to the fields. The one hundred sixty acres had been raised on some of it this year. He picked up some of the fine black soil, pressed it in his hands, and slowly let it fall back to mother earth.
"I am like my kinsmen in Scotland, Margaret. I would like to own some land."
Margaret gave a big sigh of relief. "We will find other fields, darling, and build greater harvests. The bottoms have wonderful dreams of home, wife, and children. Margaret, life will be so complete."
The young lady looked up and smiled. "Brother Rumgay, did I remember to tell you that I love you, and I think you are wonderful?" She put her arms around him and kissed him. "Name our wedding day, Andrew, and I will make arrangements to be there."
On their way home Andrew spoke seriously. "Margaret, we have treasure on our land, but we will never hang on the wall or place on the mantel." They walked into the plains one day.
"They are more precious than the crown jewels of Scotland. Mother has her rocks, the sage, ginger tea, even the catnip. Then what comes, Margaret?"
"Her prayers and faith, Andrew. I know that my Redeemer liveth."
"With such a wife, darling, I know I cannot fail." They planned to be married as soon as arrangements could be carried out. They would take two covered wagons for the wedding trip to the temple, and all the Macs, and this time the bairns.
One afternoon Andrew left his wagon up at Mother Mac's, for the women to pack everything they would need on the trip. They expected to leave at five the next morning. In the evening he went along to see that everything was ready. Bob was just putting in the wagon box the table and benches he had chopped to build fires.
"What, no Bob to build the fires?" Andrew asked.
"Mother is taking everything we used on the plains--tents, camp kettles, dishes, bedding, and this time we have a lantern."
"Mother says we are just now finishing up the trek, attending to the business that should have been taken care of years ago."
"Your mother has something there, Bob. Why didn't she mention it to me? How are the boxes? Mine are full. I can trust your mother."
"Well, that part won't be just like the plains," Bob gratefully admitted.
The Macs had planned to hold a reception at Mother's when they returned, but the people of the ward had taken things over. The meetinghouse was decorated, and the sisters had cooked a big wedding supper at the Hunters. They had baked other wedding cakes, as one would not be enough for everyone in town to have a piece. After the supper there was a wonderful program, and at the last Brother Huntcraft had a few words to say to Andrew and Margaret.
"I'll only keep you a few minutes. I know you all want to dance. I'd like to find a word Angus started. Andrew, a few years ago you and I picked out some land on the river bottoms.
"Well, after you left on your mission, the people decided that since you were so willing to go into the world and represent us, they would like to do something for you. Tonight we are giving you back the one hundred and sixty acres, all paid for, and nearly all broken up. And this is just one of the many wedding presents the people of Resplendence are giving to you tomorrow night, Brother and Sister Rumgay. A long and happy married life!"
Andrew felt he had the world in his arms when the Lord gave him Margaret. Now, with the land, and the many gifts his friends had showered upon them, he was amazed.
They called for a speech, and Andrew stood up. "Brothers and Sisters, my heart is too full for expression tonight. When a man has the gospel, a wife, home, land, beautiful gifts, and kind friends, no words can express his appreciation. I hope through my life and the rest of my life to prove to the Lord, and to you, how grateful I really am. Thanks a lot, folks."
At the end of the party they passed the wedding cake. Everyone called for a dance by the Macs. The orchestra began playing "Annie Laurie." Brother Coleman danced with Mother Mac, Bob chose Helen Hunter who was just about a Mac.
Margaret was beautiful in her white wedding gown and long veil of white, soft lace, which she had made, sewing yard after yard, upon row until it was long enough to fall into the full, rippling folds of her dress. She wore a wreath of white satin rosebuds with blue and ivory centers. Her corsage and bouquet were of white and pink lady slippers combined with blue sisters.
Kathleen was lovely in a beautiful shade of yellow. Mother, with the softest of blue hair, was very bonny in pale lavender. Janet, the little flower girl, wore pink.
The strains of the romantic music of "Annie Laurie" were changed to the sweet rhythm of "Home, Sweet Home." Everyone took partners and joined the Macs in the last dance. The music was sacred, the theme divine, as the bridal couple kept time to its beautiful melody.
"I love the cabin down on the millrace, Margaret," Andrew spoke softly.
"I have learned to love it too."
They danced a few measures, and Margaret added, "And the bairns."
Andrew waited breathlessly until Margaret spoke. "And you, too." 

Christmas Presents Can Be Different
Elizabeth Williamson

Side from the personalized gifts you will select for your family and close friends this Christmas, there are two other groups you may want to consider—your neighbors, and the people who seem to have everything. Well, who can resist good food, especially if it appeals to someone's special taste and is packaged attractively? Here are some suggestions for the people who have everything:

Page 826

Small cheeses, wrapped in bright cellophane, and attached to an evergreen branch
Packaged caviar
Spreads and relishes
Imported hors d'oeuvres
Homemade jams or jellies

If you are famous among your friends for making an unusual cake, or specializing in Christmas plum puddings, or confections, you may want to give one of these. Dates stuffed with fondant seem to be a favorite of everyone. These, wrapped in bright Christmas papers or colored tin foils, are attractive and tempting.

If your friend who has everything lives in an apartment, she will especially appreciate food. Perhaps some of your home-canned fruits, jellies, or pickles will be very welcome. You may give vegetables from your own garden, such as dried onions, potatoes, or squash.

Packaged fresh fruit, containing oranges, lemons, or grapefruit, with a liberal sprinkling of nuts, is another idea. Put these (fruits or vegetables) in large containers which can be used later. For example, use a wastepaper basket full of assorted fruit, or a magazine rack containing squash and onions. Dish drainers, lettuce drainers, or anything which appeals to your imagination can be used.

Your close neighbors very likely will have the same type of garden, grow the same vegetables, and make the same jams and jellies you do, so perhaps the food suggested above 827 will not serve as a very exciting gift for them, but don't you think freshly baked Christmas pastry, or a big crunchy breakfast cake, dotted with nuts and maraschino cherries, will appeal to them for their Christmas breakfast? Individual plum puddings, a mincemeat pie, fruitcakes, will be gratefully received. Your neighbor will be very pleased to know that you haven't forgotten her during the rush of the holiday season.

Christmas Letter
Grace Rushton Squire in the real sense of the word, Christmas means more to a mother than it means to anyone else.
That means more than a mother? It commemorates the birth of the Savior, and who knows just what lies in the hearts of all mothers as a sacred knowledge of the reality for which Christ truly stands—the birth of a little Babe. The spirit of that Babe of Bethlehem dwells in every mother's heart and acts as a focus which at Christmas time, when hearts are softened with the spirit of giving, draws closer the bond of kindred hearts, which the cares, pleasures, and sorrows of this world are continually striving to break.
At this season of the year, when the earth is wrapped in a sheet of white, when trees are bare and nature is lying asleep, the heart is turned to the spiritual and moral. The call is for in her family lie her hopes, joys, and ambitions. The mother's heart is then calling her family—the family circle that is where her heart is calling.

North Central States Mission, Williston (South Dakota) Branch Relief Society Handwork Display
Sister Ann Jane Killpack, President, North Central States Relief Society, reports that the sisters of the Williston Branch have been blessed abundantly for their willingness to serve and have found great joy in doing so. Under the able direction of President Anne Bean, the principal goal of this group has been to support the Welfare program to their utmost.
"Already on the way to Europe," Sister Killpack reports, "are five large and five small quilts, ten baby blankets, seventeen kimonas, and two dozen pairs of mittens. The mittens are exceptionally outstanding as they were all made from old winter coats, then lined with flannel, and reinforced with the tops of men's socks to hold them tight at the wrists. Thus they are warm, resisting both the rain and the snow. Along with these were sent boxes of made-over garments."

South Los Angeles Stake (California) Entertains Relief Society Members Over Seventy
Approximately 450 guests attended this delightful social honoring the forty-two members of the stake Relief Societies who are over seventy years old. Especially honored was Sister Mary Rockwood (inset), ninety years of age, who has been a secretary in Relief Society for more than twenty-five years. As an infant she was brought across the plains to Utah in a covered wagon. As a young woman she was an officer in the Retrenchment Society and also delivered copies of the Woman's Exponent from door to door, to save postage for mailing that pioneer publication.
"The mother of ten children, Sister Rockwood experienced the hard work and trials connected with rearing a large family under pioneer conditions. She made soap, candles, quilts, carpets, and clothing; she dried fruit, took care of a garden, sat up with the sick, and helped to prepare the dead for burial. Sister Rockwood now lives in Huntington Park Ward with her daughter Laura Stephens.

AS the boys moved out of earshot, Adele stepped forward. "Isn't it about time for your lunch, Santa?" she inquired. "I beg your pardon, madam," Roy said. Then, noticing the giveaway in the tone of his voice, despite his effort to disguise it, he added ruefully, "I might have known you'd find me out. I admit it's more than lunch time. Just wait a second, while I change coats, and I'll take you out for a sandwich."

"I have to talk to a saleswoman upstairs," said Adele. "Tl attend to that while I wait. But, Roy, whatever happened at Freem's, you should have told me." "Nothing spectacular happened at F'reem's," he stated simply. "Just the unexpected return from Tokyo of one Major Dickson, an expert assistant manager, with honorable discharge papers in good order, and considerably more than a murmur ailing his heart. I would have told you, if I hadn't known that I could keep us in the income class by Santa Clausing until Christmas and helping with the pre-inventory sale here until the new year. And after that I have the promise of helping out with income tax returns at the State Capitol. In my spare time I'll continue to haunt the employment agency, in the hope of getting something really good lined up again."

"And I know you will," reassured Adele.

The beauty of it was, she felt, that she actually did know that he would. It might be ridiculous, but, after all, it was traditional to feel just this warmly confident when one walked beside that bulky, redclad figure. All the while she had worried so about wherever Roy could be, he had been fully competent to take care of his share in their partnership.

Conscious that Roy was still talking as he led her toward the back of the store, Adele centered her attention on his words. "I certainly wasn't going to tell you about this stunt until afterward. I'm glad it doesn't strike you as being too rugged. But, once I get a real job lined up again, no more of this Santa Claus gag for me!"

"T wasn't going to tell you, either," said Adele, and the merriment in her eyes became something that was deeper.

"But, 'Lean your ear this way,' Saint Nicholas! No matter how good a job you line up—from this year on, you'll have to count on assuming the role of Santa Claus, permanently."

LIVING TO ENJOY THE BLESSINGS OF THE LORD 833 Living to Enjoy the Blessings of the Lord (Continued from page 800) before you, in the not far distant future, the possibility of a building, a women's building, erected by the generosity and self-sacrifice and faith and devotion of the women of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, that will be the equal, I am sure, of any building that women use in all the world as a women's building. So I congratulate you on your possibilities, on your probabilities, because I think in the not far distant future, if the world will come to its senses, if they will stop quarreling with one another, people will stop fighting one another and do more praying and less fussing, I think we can begin the erection of our building for the Relief Society that will not only give joy to you who are particularly interested, but all the rest of us will be happy that you have it.

We have been doing a lot of repairing of one kind and another, been working on this organ, making that a little better than it was before, that is, we hope we have. I have not been listening to it lately, but I am assuming that it is very 'much improved, and when they get it finished I am sure we will all be happy. But think what it means. Here you are. You have come into this greatest of all houses of worship. "There is not anything else like it, no other house in the world with a dome like this, no other house in the world that has the acoustics that this building has, and in this building we have one of the loveliest organs that anybody has in all the world. And wonderful choirs sing here. The voices of our Father's sons and daughters are heard here. It does seem to me when we sing if we would just appreciate how good he has been to us, it ought to be the easiest thing in the world to sing his praises while we are here in this marvelous building.

Blessings of Saints As I look over the audience I see the children and the children's children of some of those who were pioneers, came into this valley in an early day, and they came here with the word of the Lord in their hands. They not only had the Old and the New Testament, the Holy Bible, but they brought with them the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great Price, and other scriptures, all that the world has in the way of true scripture we have, plus a lot of other scripture that the world has not had until the Lord gave it to us. Surely we are not unmindful of all these things.

And when I think of the beautiful block that we are on here, and the flowers and the shrubs and the trees, the glorious sunshine that we enjoy here in this part of the world, and all of the blessings that God has bestowed upon us in such a rich way, and our homes, I am extremely grateful. Do you realize that when the people came into this valley, a little over one hundred and one years ago, there was not a house that a human being could live in? Now look at it. Lovely homes, lovely churches, streets, conveniences of almost every kind you can think of.

I cannot think
of a convenience that is important in all the world that we do not have
right here in this valley that a hundred and one years ago was a desert.
And when President Brigham Young looked over this valley and said: 'This is the place,' I can imagine that there were people in that group of 143 men, three women, and two children, who thought he must be dreaming. They could not imagine that this could be the place the Lord wanted them to settle.
But it was, and see what has happened.
And now, people come from all parts of the world to see what has been accomplished here in the last hundred years. Hardly a week passes that somebody does not come into the office who has never been here before and says, "This is one of the most beautiful cities as you have here."
Promises to the Righteous
Now, all the blessings that have come to us, brothers and sisters, are the result of keeping the commandments of God. All these blessings are not the result of our willfulness, our carelessness, or our indifference, but they are the result of honoring God and keeping his commandments, and there have been enough of our people who have saved the day for the rest.
You will remember in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah, when Abraham pleaded for two great cities that they be not destroyed because the people were so wicked, and when he asked: "Why would you not destroy the righteous people who are there in those cities," and the heavenly personage said to him: "No, not if there are enough of them."
Then Abraham began to plead. "If there are fifty people in those two great cities can they all be saved?"
"Yes."
"Forty?"
"Yes."
"Thirty?"
"Yes."
"Twenty?"
"Yes."
"Ten?"
Yes.
That is how precious righteous people are. Let us not forget that.
If there had been ten righteous people in those two great cities, and they were populous cities, the fire would not have come down from heaven to destroy them, but they would have had another chance.
Now, think of what we have here. Think of the righteous men and women that live in the community that you live in, and they are righteous. They are not perfect. I do not know any perfect people, but I have known some that it seemed to me were just as near perfect as it was possible to be. That is what the Lord has promised. If you seek first, not last, but seek his kingdom and his righteousness and all other things will be added that are worthwhile. That is what he means.
And think what we have. Think of the peace and quiet enjoyed here today and in some parts of the world bombs may be dropped any moment, guns may begin firing at any time. Why? Because the difference being, here we are trying to do what our Heavenly Father would like us to do and there, many of them are doing what they know they should not do.
Now, my brethren and sisters, and particularly the sisters, because you are the majority in this great audience today by far, I congratulate you. I congratulate you on belonging to the finest organization in all the world, officered, managed, and planned and carried on by women. There is not anything else like it, and I hope that you will keep in mind the suggestion of one of your sisters today to look after those who are not taking advantage of their opportunities. Do a little missionary work wherever you are and encourage others to do the same thing, and instead of having a few thousand people who are willing to do what the Lord wants them to do and make every effort to do that, there will be millions of people who are influenced to keep the commandments of God and stay the destruction that the Lord has said will come upon the earth unless the people repent of their sins and turn to him. He has already assured us that it will take repentance.
I would not like to sound a discordant note here, nor cause anybody to begin to worry because of the destruction that may come, but I can say this that the Lord has promised you in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that if you will seek first his kingdom, that all desirable things will be added. That means the undesirable things will be stayed and your homes will be the abiding place of peace and thanksgiving and gratitude to God, and mothers and fathers will love one another and work together in rearing their families. Parents will cherish their children and bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, and children will be taught to honor father and mother with the assurance that their days may be long in the land that the Lord our God gives unto us.
Gratitude for Hospitality
I have just touched upon a few of the things that the Lord has promised to us and to all people who will accept him and his advice. I think it is marvelous. I want to take this occasion to thank you, good women living in different parts of the country, who have taken care of us who are General Authorities of the Church as we have traveled through the country; we have been in your homes. You have fed us; you have given us places where we could be made comfortable, and in many cases you and your husbands have carried us on our way. I am grateful to you for the kindness that I have received.
It has been marvelous to me how many times I have been in a position where I needed real help, and it has come as a result of good women and good men in the community where I happened to be.
Now, coming back to the building, I wish we could tell you right now when it can be started. I wish we could tell you just when a number of them could be started. We are needing buildings for the Church in so many cases. We were in need of over four hundred houses of worship and structures to be used by the Church a year ago, and it may interest you to know that over two hundred of them are already finished or are in the course of completion.
Half of them, but there are yet another two hundred and more, and in so many cases where two communities or three use the same house for worship, in due time each will have its own house and its place of recreation, and all will meet together as brothers and sisters under the influence of the Spirit of the Lord.
How wonderful it is to have that influence. Come into this building when there is not a soul here and close your eyes and I think you will feel like others have.

Time after time people have said there seems to be an influence here that I have never felt any place else. There should be. There should be an influence in this building that people can feel because the Lord has promised that his Spirit will abide in these places that have been dedicated to him as long as we treat them as we ought to. I congratulate you. I wish I had words to express my appreciation for what you are doing, what has been done by those who have preceded you and for what your daughters who are coming along will do even after you are gone. What an opportunity the Lord has blessed us with, to give us the fulness of the earth in these marvelous mountain vales, and all the advantages and opportunities of the civilization of our day, plus the testimony that burns in the souls of hundreds of thousands of people that we are the children of God and we know it, and if we are righteous, may remain close to him throughout the ages of eternity. I congratulate the leadership of this great organization, your presidency and general board, the stake officers, and the ward officers. If you could get them all together this block would not hold them, to say nothing of this building. They are a great army of women and when you realize that at one time ten righteous people could have saved Sodom and Gomorrah from destruction, think what an influence you have, think what power you have in this world if you are recorded among those who are righteous, honoring God and keeping his commandments. It will not be long before disaster will come to the earth. It will not be very long before this earth will be cleansed and purified by fire and become the celestial kingdom, but in the meantime, the Lord has given to us the opportunity to go forward, rear our families, develop our homes, prepare our institutions of learning and all the advantages, under the influence of the same spirit, if we will, that will be here when our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, our Lord, will be here in person. Think what a wonderful thing it is! That is the preparation for it, that is why these commandments were given and the other commandments of the Lord, not to prevent us from happiness, but to add to our joy and our comfort and our satisfaction, day by day, while we go forward looking to the time when we will be with those whom we love forever. As I stand here today I realize it may not be long until the summons reaches me. When it comes I will pass out of the picture here in mortality, but when that time comes I am looking forward to meeting the dear ones that have preceded me, those who have gone before. And LIVING TO ENJOY THE BLESSINGS OF THE LORD there are many of them on the other side that have gone through the experiences of mortal life, have lived true and faithfully and devotedly, so that our Heavenly Father has promised them they may return to earth as celestial beings and dwell here throughout the ages of eternity. That is what these books are for. That is why the Lord gives us so much information that we refer to as scripture. It is not that we may have food and clothing and houses and lands here. That is only a part of it. It is that day by day we may so adjust our lives that we will become more perfect as the years go by, rear our families to be more perfect. That is the purpose of it all, in order that all may be saved in the celestial kingdom and have the companionship of those who are dear to us, forever. Relief Society for All the Sisters That is what this great organization you belong to was instituted for. It was not just to make quilts. It was not just to go from door to door and ask people to make a contribution to your fund. That was only a part of it. The Relief Society of this Church was organized that all of the daughters of our Heavenly Father, I say all of them, because it was intended that they should, those who are worthy should be identified with the Relief Society of the Church, and that each one should not only be a member but that each should be a faithful, devoted daughter of the Lord, working in that organization of Relief Society for the blessing of all your sisters. What an influence you have in the world, and how much more influence can be had if you can persuade your sisters in the communities in which you live, that are not doing anything particular in preparation for eternal life in the celestial kingdom, to come into the fold and begin work. I have been talking about the sisters, inferring that there are some women that are not yet doing all they should in the Church, but I would like to say to the two or three or half a dozen brethren that are here, we have a whole group of men in the Church whom unless we can get the sisters to help us, I do not think we will get very far with. We have men in the Church who have grown up in it, who do not even hold the Priesthood and we have others who ought to hold the Melchizedek Priesthood who only hold the Aaronic Priesthood, hundreds of them, and if they die under those circumstances they may lose their opportunity of eternal life in the celestial kingdom, and they are your brothers and husbands and fathers, in some cases. I do not mean you who are sitting here, but I mean the women, husbands and fathers and brothers, these men, and we need to do teamwork, and we need to set our homes in order. If our sisters would only encourage their husbands to do their part, visiting in the wards in which they live as ward teachers, trying to draw the men in that have not done just what they should, and then the women would go out and do their share, encouraging the women to come in. Do you realize what the Lord has said? What matters it though you spend your whole life here upon earth, performing the duties incident to mortality, spend your whole life, and during that time the result of your effort is the salvation of one soul, and that your own? He said you shall have great joy in our Father's kingdom with that soul. We all have something to do, and I congratulate you on what you have done.

No other group of women in all the world has compared with what you have done in the way of blessing mankind, rearing your families and devoting yourselves unselfishly to bringing peace and happiness to those that were in distress, and because of that, the Lord loves you, and he is anxious that you should have every advantage and every blessing, and he will give it to you just as fast as you are worthy. I am grateful to be here with you today. I thank these sisters who invited me to come and visit with you, and I want to be among those who will be permitted to come into your new building when it is completed. I hope that it may be kept so sweet and clean and wholesome and beautiful and delightful that the Spirit of the Lord will find comfort there. That is what I hope it to be, and I trust that that will be in the not far distant future. I wish I could tell you just where it could be located. I wish I knew, but it will not be far away from the Temple. It will not be far away from the Tabernacle, and I want to say to you it will not be very far away from the Lord, and that is the important part. So keep smiling, keep working, keep planning, and praying. Remember your sisters in the old world, millions of them, who have comparatively no comforts. In twenty-four hours they could not enjoy the peace that you have here in five minutes in this building today, wherever they are, and they are your sisters. We have over five thousand missionaries in the world endeavoring to bring the peace and happiness that you have to our Father's other sons and daughters. A good many of those in the world are women. There was a time when our sisters did not go into the world very much as missionaries. There was a time when some of the mission presidents did not think they could do missionary work very well, it was so difficult, but if you would see some of the letters that are written in from mission presidents now, "Cannot you send us some of those fine women that can do such splendid work among the women and among the children in these lands?" There is a way. It is coming. In the not far distant future there will be more missionaries out. If we will just keep the standard of liberty and of righteousness floating here in our homeland, keeping our homes in order, husbands faithful and devoted to wives, and wives faithful and devoted to husbands, parents to children, children to parents, neighbors to neighbors, remembering that the second great commandment referred to in this wonderful volume by the Savior of the world was: "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." If we did that how wonderful it would be to go from house to house and from village to village and find dwelling in every heart the Spirit of God burning there in a luminous, delightful way, filling the soul with happiness and peace and comfort and satisfaction and knowing that that will endure forever. I pray that the Lord will bless LIVING TO ENJOY THE BLESSINGS OF THE LORD these presiding officers, the general officers, the stake officers, the ward officers, all these who have responsibility, and oh, let your light so shine that others seeing your good works will be constrained to glorify the name of our Heavenly Father. We are his children. This is a part of his family that is gathered here today. How wonderful it is to know that he is not far from us, that he is all-powerful, and has promised us that if trouble comes, if necessary he will come down in heaven, not from heaven, he will bring heaven with him upon this earth and fight our battles and preserve us, and we will go on living throughout the ages of eternity. That is the promise of our Heavenly Father.

| Again, I thank you for your kindness to me and to my associates as we travel in your communities, your kindness to all those who need you, your kindness to those people who live across the great and mighty ocean. I do not know whether you have been told, but probably you have, one hundred and twelve carloads, each car the capacity of forty tons, a hundred and twelve carloads of food and bedding and clothing have been shipped across the ocean 839 since the war to feed and make comfortable your other brothers and sisters, some of whom have not yet come into the Church. That has been your contribution. How many quilts did you have? We have had in total about nine thousand. My goodness! Just about two months from now you will wake up some morning, somebody has left the window open and the fire has gone out and you will wish you had just one more quilt, and then realize that the organization that you belong to, in that one item—that is only one item—over nine thousand handmade, homemade, quilts have been made by your organization, and then you have asked for the privilege of giving them, not selling them 'of giving them to our Father's other children that they may be, in part at least, as comfortable as you are. God bless you for your faith and your devotion and your fine work. Keep your homes in order. Keep the adversary away. Live so that the Spirit of God will be with you all the time, and I can say to you that if you will do that you will be happy all the time and that you may so be, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ONE LONE STAR
Dorothy J. Roberts

I shall be there; I must return
Tonight when one lone star will burn
Across the acres of the world.
Before its last faint gleam is furled
I shall follow the camel's hoof;
See winter silver on the roof;
And set my heart attune to hear—
Despite the centuries—one clear Hosanna,
Filtered though it be, coming from hilltops far from me.

I shall breathe the scent of myrrh
Blent by the kneeling worshipper;
And behold the jewels spread
Beside one on his humble bed.
With all the hungering hosts of men,
I shall partake of peace again.
Before the waning year is spent
I shall return for sacrament.
