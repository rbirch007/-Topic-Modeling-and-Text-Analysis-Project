RING OUT, YE BELLS
Ruth May Fox
Ring out, ye bells of Christmas time,
Ring out, ye olden joyous rhyme,
Which did not flow from poet's pen,
But from the courts of heaven to earth,
Announcing Christ's perfect birth.
Oh, Christmas bells, ring out again:
Peace, peace on earth, good will to men.
Ye Christmas bells, ring out again
And tell us of the moonlit plain
Where heavenly beings talked with men
About the Babe of Bethlehem;
Where shepherds watched their flocks by night,
When hosts of angels, gleaming bright,
Winged onward to the humble stall
Where lay the Babe, the Lord of all;
Then sung their song of joy again:
Peace, peace on earth, good will to men.
Ye Christmas bells, ring out again;
Again, again, and yet again,
Until we are the hearts of men
To honor the Babe of Bethlehem:
Until the scepter and the crown
And men shall walk in paths of peace.
