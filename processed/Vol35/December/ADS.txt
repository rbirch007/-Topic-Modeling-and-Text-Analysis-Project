In addition to conducting the affairs of the Church at headquarters, he planned and directed the openings of the Mexican and Maori (New Zealand) missions; inaugurated the Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, and Upper Snake River Valley colonizations of the saints; planned the colonization of saints in Mexico and sent missionaries to labor among the Indians in Idaho, Wyoming, New Mexico, and Arizona.

It was during President Taylor's administration that the golden jubilee of the Church was celebrated, and in spite, of the persecution that was directed against the saints it was made a time of rejoicing.

Debts due the Perpetual Emigration Fund by poor saints were cancelled, as were overdue tithes; cattle, and sheep were distributed to the poor and the needy; and the Relief Society was called upon to assist in the good work for the benefit of the Church as a whole. The preceding year had been one of great drought and there was a scarcity of seed-wheat for the new crop. President Taylor suggested that the Relief Society sisters lend their 34,761 bushels of stored wheat— they had been accumulating it for years against a time of need—to the farmers, to be repaid without interest after the harvest. 'This was gladly done and proved to be of great benefit to all of the settlements.

President Taylor was a man of culture and refinement. He wrote as a gifted theologian and a profoundly religious philosopher. His literary writings, as well as his sermons, manifest a beautiful style. As recreation he wrote religious poetry and drama. His best known poems which have been set to music are the missionary hymn, "Go Ye Messengers of Glory," "The Glorious Plan," and "The Seer," in which latter he poured out his heart concerning his departed Prophet-leader.

Due to the crusade that was being waged against the Church, President Taylor was faced with the alternative of submitting to a prison sentence or retiring from the public eye. He chose the latter course and made no public appearance after February 1884. From his post in exile he directed the affairs of the Church to the best of his ability. The enforced separation from his family and his inability to get the exercise to which he was accustomed, undoubtedly shortened his life. He died in exile at Kaysville, Utah, on July 25, 1887.

God had guided this leader from his native England to the New World where the restored gospel awaited him, and then given him inspiration to guide the destinies of the kingdom. Of God on earth was George O. Cannon

George Q. Cannon, whom President Taylor chose to be his first counselor in 1880, was born in Liverpool, England in 1827, and was baptized by Elder Taylor in June 1840. Emigrating with his parents to Nauvoo in 1842, he went to live at the home of his uncle, Elder John Taylor, and until 1849 was considered a part of the Taylor household. At Nauvoo he learned the printing and publishing business under the tutelage of his uncle, and this skill proved of great worth to himself and the Church in later years.

He emigrated to Utah in 1847. "Bibles Since 1863 at Your Bookstore" "Better Living" Buy From YOUR DEALER Utah Power & Light Company

Brigham Young recognized in him a man of great ability both in temporal and spiritual matters, and he was called as a missionary to the Hawaiian Islands in 1850. He remained there until 1854 and during these four years was primarily instrumental in the conversion of about four thousand natives to the Church. He acquired great proficiency in the use of the Hawaiian language and translated The Book of Mormon into that tongue, and later at San Francisco, published this work.

He was ordained an apostle August 26, 1860, and left soon afterward for New York where he acted as immigration agent for the Church. In 1861 he established the first Church owned printing shop in England, and for many years this establishment was the chief publishing center for Church literature. While in charge of the British Mission between 1862 and 1864, he directed the emigration of upwards of 13,000 saints to America in especially chartered vessels. Charles Dickens visited one of these vessels before it sailed, to make a report on emigration, and saw President Cannon supervising and organizing the group for the voyage. He paid President Cannon and the Mormon emigrants some fine compliments in his article in Uncommercial Traveler.

President Cannon established the Juvenile Instructor (now The Instructor) in 1866, as a means of teaching the gospel to the youth of Zion. He devoted many years to the organization of the Sunday Schools in the Church and was a member of the Sunday School Union from its organization in 1867 until his death in 1901. A man of great speaking and reasoning ability, he was elected as territorial delegate to Congress for ten years and held numerous positions within the territorial government of Utah.

To President Cannon the Church is greatly indebted for the publishing of much of its literature. He encouraged many of the early converts to the Church and more recent ones to write their religious experiences for the benefit of the young people. These were subsequently published in the Juvenile Instructor and as pamphlets or booklets. As first counselor to John Taylor, he shared with his President the hardships of the persecutions of the 1880's and stood by him as a valiant assistant in managing the affairs of the Church.

Joseph F. Smith The second counselor of President John Taylor, Joseph F. Smith, was a son of Hyrum Smith, brother of the Prophet, and was born at Far West, Missouri, on November 13, 1838. He had spent a life of service for the Church at the time the call to the Presidency came in 1880. He had gone on his first mission at the age of fifteen to the Hawaiians and had been ordained an apostle in 1866.

A further account of his life and labors will appear in the following lesson and the one dealing with him as President of the Church.
