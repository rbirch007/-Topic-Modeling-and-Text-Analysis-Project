        "content": "Brigham Young University campus in Provo, with other substantial school and seminary buildings, two up-to-date gymnasiums located in Salt Lake and Ogden, and three large, modern hospitals located in Salt Lake, Ogden, and Idaho Falls. And now, in order to extend hospital facilities to remote regions of the Church, a number of smaller hospitals are being established in some of the smaller communities. We point with pride also to our many fine, commodious ward chapels, in connection with which attractive recreation halls have been erected. In addition to these public and Church buildings, hundreds of beautiful and comfortable homes have been built by the individual members of the Church. It can hardly be realized that in one single century a Church with such a small membership, and established faraway in a desert, could accomplish so much in the way of erecting so many permanent, dignified, massive, and architecturally admirable buildings. Latter-day Saints will continue to build magnificently, if they appreciate and build upon the foundation laid by their pioneer ancestors.\n\nSuggestions for Discussion\n\nSome of the teachers might be given an opportunity to mention and describe other Latter-day Saint buildings and features of buildings which they admire, calling attention to the need of preserving historic buildings intact. See pages 24 and 25 for \"Relief Society Building News\"\n\nWork Meetings\nSewing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting)\nLesson 6\u2014Fitted Facings Jean Ridges Jennings\n\nFor Tuesday, March 9, 1948\nReference: The Complete Book of Sewing, Chapter VIII, pp. 65-69; XV, 105, 106; XX, 134, 135.\n\nOne of the very useful techniques which has numerous possibilities is that of applying fitted facings. The uses for this finish are almost unlimited. Wherever we find an edge with a curve, a point, or an unusual shape, it is most easily finished with a fitted facing. Although binding, cording, piping, etc., are frequently employed as methods of decorating and completing necks, sleeves, and various other parts of garments, when a plain, inconspicuous, and practical finish is called for, we resort to the fitted facing.\n\nAs a general rule, commercial patterns include, with the other pieces, pattern sections by which to cut facings for edges of a garment requiring them. But, in some instances, they are omitted and the user is instructed to cut a bias strip an inch or two in width and employ it as a facing. This method is frequently troublesome, especially if the edge to be faced is curved or shaped. For these cases, it is difficult to obtain a flat and smooth look.\n\nFor curved or square neck lines; for edges with a series of scallops, points, or squares; for shaped sleeve edges; for collars, lapels, or pocket flaps, try using fitted facings. It is not necessary to always have a pattern for cutting fitted facings. The edge of the garment itself can serve as a pattern.\n\nCare must be taken to cut the facing in the same shape and size as the edge to be finished, having the grain of the material run in the same direction in both the garment and the facing. If there are seams to be joined, such as at the shoulders of a neck facing, they must be sewed and pressed open and flat, as the first step.\n\nNext, the edge of the facing is placed on top the edge of the garment, the two right sides together, basted in place, and then stitched on the sewing machine, with an even seam allowance all around. At this point, edges with an inside curve must be snipped at frequent intervals so that the facing will not pucker at the edge when it is turned inside. For the same reason we must also snip into the points between scallops and into squared corners to the line of machine stitching.\n\nOn outside curves, such as scallops or rounded collars and lapels, notches should be cut out at frequent intervals to avoid too much bulk when the facing is turned. The excess seam must be cut off in the points of collars, cuffs, lapels, etc. The raw edge of the facing is usually finished off by turning under once, stitching it on the sewing machine, or with a small running hand stitching, close to the fold, and then tacking it lightly to the body of the garment.\n\nOf the Doctrine and Covenants\nElder H. Wayne Driggs\n\nLesson 7\u2014Doctrinal Exposition of the Doctrine and Covenants\n\nFor Tuesday, April 20, 1948\nObjective: To appreciate the Doctrine and Covenants as literature through a discussion of the wisdom contained in modern scripture.\n\nThe most frequent type of writing found in the Doctrine and Covenants is that of doctrinal exposition and instruction. This is not strange, either, when one considers the state of affairs the world was in at the time of Joseph Smith's first vision. So snarled were the concepts of men regarding the way of life that churches had sprung up on the slightest pretext of doctrine. To a youth of questioning mind, such as Joseph, there could be no satisfaction in the evasive turns of reason propounded by the ministers of his day. Small wonder, then, that there was much need for inspired instruction through a latter-day prophet, if the simple truths of the gospel were again to be understood.\n\nAs suggested in the title of this modern scripture, the Lord's doctrines and covenants have come to earth again in renewed ways. These throw additional light upon the Priesthood, the Organization, the ordinances and commandments of his Church, and point the way his saints must go to find salvation. The Lord has spoken to us in this day in the language which we can understand.\n\nNote the following passages:\nTreasure up in your minds continually the words of life (84:85).\nFor my soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads (25:12).\n\nVerily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness; for the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in no wise lose their reward (58:27-28). For this is a day of warning, and not a day of many words. For I, the Lord, am not to be mocked in the last days (63:58). Behold, now it is called today until the coming of the Son of Man, and verily it is a day of sacrifice, and a day for the tithing of my people; for he that is tithed shall not be burned at his coming (64:23). I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise (82:10). Yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith (88:118). Cease to be idle; cease to be unclean; cease to find fault one with another; cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated (88:124). And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones; and shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures; and shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint. And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them. Amen (89:18-21). For man is spirit. The elements are eternal, and spirit and element, inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy; and when separated, man cannot receive a fulness of joy. The elements are the tabernacle of God; yea, man is the tabernacle of God, even temples; and whatsoever temple is defiled, God shall destroy that temple. The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth (93:33-36). Verily, verily, I say unto you, that when I give a commandment to any of the sons of men to do a work unto my name, and those sons of men go with all their might and with all they have to perform that work, and cease not their diligence, and their enemies come upon them and hinder them from performing that work, behold, it behooveth me to require that work no more at the hands of those sons of men, but to accept of their offerings. And the iniquity and transgression of my holy laws and commandments I will visit upon the heads of those who hindered my work, unto the third and fourth generation, so long as they repent not, and hate me, saith the Lord God (124:49, 50). It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance (131:6). Here is writing with the inspiration of divinity. Activities and Readings for Appreciation The discussion for this class period may well be spent in reading a number of sections of the Doctrine and Covenants which bring added light to the gospel. For example, in the 93 section, the Lord defines the relationship between himself and the Father, in the following verses 1-5: Verily, thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am; and that I am the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world, and that I am in the Father, and the Father in me, and the Father and are one\u2014the Father because he gave me of his fulness, and the Son because I was in the world and made flesh my tabernacle, and dwelt among the sons of men. I was in the world, and received of my Father, and the works of him were plainly manifest. This section 93 also deals with the record of John, the apostle and revelator, Jesus Christ, the Firstborn, the place of man in the beginning with God, the eternal nature of the elements, and the glory of God. It is the direct and forceful manner of this inspired scripture that appeals. Call upon the class to read carefully each part of this section outlining the above doctrines and note for discussion the clarity of language and style of expression. Single out those passages which are best remembered. Additional sections for similar discussions may be found under the numbers 27, 29, 84, 88, 107. There are others which may be suggested by the class. Be ready to read and discuss a favorite passage of instruction you have loved from the Doctrine and Covenants.\n\n6 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE\ufffdJANUARY 1948\n\nSocial Science-Essentials in Home Training Lesson 6- Tolerance Elder Joseph Jacobs\nFor Tuesday, April 27, 1948\nObjective: To show that the teachings of the Lord breathe the spirit of tolerance, and that tolerance is not acceptance.\nWhat Is Tolerance?\nIt was Voltaire who said, \"I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.\" Such is the spirit of tolerance. Tolerance is a calm, generous respect for the opinions of others, even of one's enemies. It recognizes the right of every man to think his own thoughts, to live his own life, to be himself in all things, so long as he does not run counter to the rights of others. It means giving to others the same freedom that we ourselves crave (William George Jordan: The Power of Truth, page 97).\n\nWherein Do We See the Tolerance of Christ Manifest?\nChrist's teachings exemplified tolerance. During his ministry, the Savior was accused of consorting with the sinners and publicans and with many people whom the accusers thought beneath his station. Jesus' reply to this accusation was: They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick ... for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance (Matt 9:12, 13). Tolerance makes a distinction between the sin and the sinner. The Lord himself said: For I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance; nevertheless, he that repents and does the commandments of the Lord shall be forgiven (D&C 1:31-32). We are not to condone sin nor partake of it in any form, but neither should we judge the sinner: \"I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men\" (D&C 64:10). When the woman taken in adultery was brought before Christ, the scribes and Pharisees sought to trap Jesus because the law of Moses decreed that such should be stoned: \"But what sayest thou?\" they demanded. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.\n\nSo when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee? She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more (John 8:6-11). His admonition, \"go and sin no more,\" gave her new hope for the future. Only God can see the strivings, the desires, the real intent of a person's heart. We see only the outward manifestations, and so we are not qualified to judge. When we sit in solemn judgment of the acts and characters of those around us and condemn them with the easy nonchalance of our ignorance,... We reveal our intolerance (William George Jordan: The Power of Truth, page 105).\n\nWhat Is the Latter-day Saint Viewpoint Regarding Religious Tolerance? As Latter-day Saints, in reviewing the past history of our Church, we know the venom of religious intolerance. It seems incredible that men could heap such vicious hatred upon any people because of their religious views, however, the pages of history are filled with accounts of the awful persecution of the innocent because of religion. Tolerance for the religious beliefs of others is part of the Latter-day Saint doctrine. Our 11th Article of Faith says: We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may. Free agency is an eternal principle by means of which God permits us to work out our own destiny. The right of every man to live as he sees fit is a sacred privilege. At one time the Prophet Joseph Smith was asked how he governed so many people harmoniously in one faith. His reply was simple but full of wisdom: \"I teach them correct principles and they govern themselves.\" The incident is related that when the members of the Catholic church first began to hold meetings in Salt Lake City they had no place in which to meet and the use of the old Tabernacle was offered to them. And so they made use of this building for their services. President Brigham Young was also instrumental in getting the title cleared when they purchased their first property here. This was an example of true religious tolerance.\n\n68 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE\ufffdJANUARY 1948 LESSON DEPARTMENT\n\nWhen we desire to show others the truths we have in our gospel, we should seek to do it in a spirit of love and gentleness, kindness and humility. Never does tolerance use the sting of sarcasm or the taunt of ridicule. In a recent lecture given before a group of missionaries soon to go into the mission field, this statement was made: \"Vanity is the one thing that may make a missionary fail. Humility is essential.\" We have no right to be smug or overbearing about our religion. Ours should be a spirit of humble gratitude that we have been privileged to partake of the gospel. Only by our good works, our kindness, and patience may we influence others to see the worth of gospel principles.\n\nSpeaking of the power of the Priesthood, we read in the Doctrine and Covenants, 121:41, 42: No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned; by kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile.\n\nHow Has Tolerance Played Its Part in Making America Great? The greatness of the American nation is very largely due to the tolerance of its people for the different groups included within its boundaries. Through the contributions of each group, progress and advancement have been made possible to a degree undreamed of in any other nation. Its broad privileges and opportunities reach out and encompass all nationalities and creeds.\n\nThe present troubles in Palestine, India, and China are directly traceable to the intolerance of one group for another.\n\n69 Professional and Social Stationery\n\nCOMMERCIAL AND EDITION PRINTERS AND BOOK BINDERS\nPAPER RULING\nDESERET NEWS PRESS\n29 Richards Street\nSalt Lake City 1, Utah\n\nDeseret News Press, 29 Richards Street Salt Lake City 1, Utah,\nSelden N.

First So. 5-588\n\nWe need tolerance toward other races and nations. Human emotions are the same in all parts of the world, and until there can be friendship and consideration for each other and each other's problems, strife will exist.\n\nTo learn to get on with people, to learn to win them to willing co-operation, to mutual understanding, to mutual respect, is one of the most valuable things we can do in life. You can only do it first by cultivating the habit of looking for good in other people, not their faults. One small thing is worth noticing.\n\nAlbert Victor BariLuiE, the Dean of Windsor: The Making of a Man, page 118\n\nIntolerance believes it is born with the peculiar talent for managing the affairs of others, without any knowledge of the details, better than the men themselves, who are giving their life's thought to the vital questions.... Let us not seek to fit the whole world with shoes from our individual last (William George Jordan: The Power of Truth, page 104).\n\nBecause I enjoy a certain type of music or a certain kind of book is no reason you should appreciate the same. Because I choose one profession is no reason yours is not equally important and beneficial to mankind. Because I do my work in a certain manner is no reason I should disdain your way.\n\nTolerance helps us to recognize and respect the differences in others and to make allowance for those differences. It enables us to respect differences in opinion, in disposition, in training, in environment, in education, in ability and opportunity. Intolerance seeks to live other people's lives for them; sympathy helps us to live their lives with them.... No one of us is infallible... Let us accept the little failings of those around us as we accept facts in nature, and make the best of them, as we accept the hard shells of nuts, the skin of fruits, the shadow that always accompanies light....\n\nIntolerance sees the mote in its neighbor's eye as larger than the beam in its own.\n\nInstead of concentrating our thought on the one weak spot in a character, let us seek to find some good quality that offsets it, just as a credit may more than cancel a debt on a ledger account.... Let us not constantly speak of roses having thorns, let us be thankful that the thorns have roses.... Measuring a man by his weakness alone is unjust. This little frailty may be but a small mortgage on a large estate.... (WILLIAM GEORGE Jordan: The Power of Truth, pp. 106, 107, 108).\n\nThere is a grave danger, of course, lest we admire tolerance merely in the abstract. We may see that it is needed in government, international affairs, and in business, and overlook the fact that it is needed equally in our own home. It is not enough that we be theoretically tolerant toward another nation if we are narrow toward the man in the next office.... Of all the commandments, \"Love thy neighbor\" is the least enforceable, the most voluntary (The Reader's Digest, February 1946, page 15).\n\nHow May Tolerance Be Fostered in the Home?\n\nTolerance in the home is vital to harmony and to happy, normal development. Parents must learn early that no two of their children are alike, nor can they be treated the same. One may exhibit a tendency which may never make its appearance in the disposition of another. One may be shy and reserved and may need more praise, kindness, and stimulation to develop his character, while another may try to dominate and show off, or there may be many variations between these two extremes.\n\n70 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE\ufffdJANUARY 1948 LESSON DEPARTMENT\n\nOne child may have a distinct talent for music while another may never be able to carry a tune, but may show outstanding mechanical ability. One mother said that in disciplining her two boys, the same treatment would never apply to both. If the elder son noticed she had been crying over something he had done, he was immediately contrite and anxious to make amends; but if she ever shed tears over the younger one, he became disgusted and angry.\n\nIntolerance manifests itself in suppression of individuality, in stern prohibitions and penalties. An intolerant parent may endeavor to break the will of a child instead of directing it in channels suited to its disposition. Confidence, sympathy, and love are the attributes which work wonders with children. President George Albert Smith has said, \"If you can't get a person to do what you wish through love, there is no other way.\" Leading is much more successful than driving.\n\nParents should not set themselves up as dictators to rule the every thought and word of a child. A few basic rules should be set up and then the individuality of each member of the family should be allowed to express itself. Sometimes parents are slow to realize that their children have grown up and can think for themselves. There comes a day when they are adults and desire to solve their own problems. Love and kindly advice, however, will always be valued, if the proper relationship has been built up during the early years.\n\nLet us be tolerant of the weakness of others, sternly intolerant of our own.

What Is the Responsibility of the Home in Teaching Reverence? The home has the first responsibility of instilling in children their earliest feelings of reverence; hence it is important that a reverential example be set in the home. The observance of family prayers, morning and evening, the blessing on the food, the reading of our Church works, are all helpful ways of teaching reverence to our children. Reverence for the Priesthood should be observed in the home. There should never be any criticism in the home against the Authorities of the Church. While these men are recognized as human beings, still they are individuals who have been chosen by God our Heavenly Father as his servants. In the army, even a second lieutenant is saluted by the enlisted soldiers because he holds a commission from the President of the United States. How much more respect should be given to those holding commissions from God.\n\nThe famous EASY-TO-READ Crystal Clear NATIONAL BIBLE No. 452. Leather, limp, gold edges. No. 453.

Not only the President of the Church, but every one who holds the Priesthood possesses a commission from our Heavenly Father. President Brigham Young stated: Whenever there is a disposition manifested in any of the members of this Church to question the right of the President of the whole Church to direct in all things, you see manifested evidence of apostasy or a spirit which, if encouraged, will lead to a separation from the Church and to final destruction; wherever there is a disposition to operate against any legally appointed officer of this Kingdom, no matter in what capacity he is called to act, if persisted in, it will be followed by the same results.... When a man begins to find fault, inquiring in regard to this, that, and the other, saying, \"Does this or that look as though the Lord dictated it?\" you may know that that person has more or less of the spirit of apostasy. Every man in this Kingdom, or upon the face of the earth, who is seeking with all his heart to save himself, has as much to do as he can conveniently attend to, without calling in question that which does not belong to him. If he succeeds in saving himself, it has well occupied his time and attention.\n\nWhat Is the Responsibility of Parents in Teaching Their Children Reverence for Ward and Stake Buildings?

Little children who attend meetings with their parents should be taught and shown by example the proper conduct to observe in the house of the Lord. They should be taught that reverence calls for quiet attention, and that boisterous or frivolous conduct is out of place. It is not becoming nor courteous for children or adults to leave a meeting before it is concluded, except in an emergency. It is observed, especially in general conference, that many people leave the meeting before the last song and prayer. The Prophet Joseph Smith gave us the following instruction in this regard: It is an insult to a meeting for persons to leave just before its close. If they must go out, let them go half an hour before.\n\nNo gentleman will go out of a meeting just at closing (D. C. H., pp. 338, 339).\n\nSURI OULEEE Porter Walton's GARDEN BOOK FREE FLOWERS The new and better annuals, perennials, bulbs, shrubs and trees. See them in our catalog and have them in your own garden.

But, reaching no sensible conclusion, she finally questioned Mrs. Carter, her next door neighbor, as to just what her husband had meant.\n\n\"tightening the knot,\" laughed Mrs. Carter, \"is a familiar saying in this particular locality, one which I believe has been handed down from generation to generation among the families who have grown up here.\"\n\n\"But what does it mean?\" Dot asked, with a bit of curiosity.\n\n\"It means just this,\" chuckled the older woman, \"the things that men and women do that bind them closer together as their years of married life increase in number.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Dot, in a tone that clearly revealed she knew very little more than she had a moment before. \"It's like this,\" Mrs. Carter went on, \"this small community prides itself on the few divorce cases registered against it, and one and all agree that it has been through the tightening of the marriage knot that such a condition exists.\"\n\n\"I guess I'm a little dull, Mrs. Carter,\" Dot answered, \"but perhaps I will learn later on what weight tightening the marriage vows carries.\"\n\n\"IT had to learn,\" laughed Mrs. Carter, \"when I first came here.\" But Mrs. West, the bride just before myself who came to live in the valley, advised me to visit with the neighbors and draw them out on the subject, and\u2014well\u2014\" she finished softly, \"doing just that opened my eyes considerably.\"\n\n\"But I'm a timid soul,\" Dot argued.\n\n\"Just the same,\" answered the woman, \"visiting the folks living here and observing them closely will make you think seriously of the nice congenial neighborhood in which you have come to live.\"\n\nIT is true Dot was timid, but she was also a keen observer, and through observation she soon discovered Esther Cooper, a very placid type of woman, living on perfectly congenial terms with her husband. She attributed the fact of her happy existence to keeping herself calm when her husband came home in a dark mood. When Dick arrived home like that, she explained, he wasn't the man she married, but only a tired, harassed business man who would recover his amiable disposition ever so much quicker by her leaving him alone.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" she admitted, when Dot questioned her about it, \"it took a little time to learn that. But once I did, I found that it tightened the knot considerably. You see, by one of the two of us remaining placid when the other is glum or nervous, no arguments can arise. And, after all, many a home begins its undoing by arguments. And by refraining from that one feminine attribute,\" laughed the soft-voiced woman, \"I have a very happy home today, and my husband rarely comes to it now in a dark mood.\"\n\nThe tightening of the knot took on an entirely different aspect in the next case. Quite an elderly couple were Mr. and Mrs. Burk, whose comfortable home Dot and big Dean frequently enjoyed. Here Dot discussed the matter with the man.\n\n\"Oh,\" chuckled the husband good-naturedly, \"I couldn't have accomplished even the half I have, if it hadn't been for my good wife. She's what one might call a seer\u2014you know, good foresight, always looking ahead and planning, and because I discovered early in the game that her judgment was better than mine, we've worked wonderfully together.\"\n\nAnother man in the community attributed his success in married life to the rose-colored glasses his wife wore. No matter how dark and threatening the clouds might be above their heads, this good woman could always catch a glimpse of the silver lining.\n\n\"That,\" said the old man, as he went about serenely planting a row of bulbs along the old-fashioned walk leading from the house to the big front gate, \"tightened our marriage knot.\"\n\nLittle Mrs. Tremble, the very busiest housewife in the whole neighborhood, and mother of seven children, gave credit for her happy life to the fact that she lived on what her husband provided, without complaining, and taught her children that mentality made them the equal of anybody, and that they had never been taught that money was considered wealth.\n\nBut it was from little Mrs. Joiner, who shared her home with both her mother and her sister-in-law, that Dot learned the greatest lesson. Such congeniality among three women Dot had never seen before. In her heart she pondered much on how it had come about, since her own relationship with her mother and her husband's sister was strained and unnatural.\n\nFinally, the opportunity came and Dot sought an explanation.\n\n\"I really give myself credit for this priceless possession,\" confided Mrs. Joiner when Dot questioned her about it. You see,\" she added very softly, \"I came from another state which, I am sorry to say, carries no such reputation as this, and when I arrived I was quick to sense I was unwanted in a family that, without me, was harmonious. My husband, realizing I wanted to be friendly with my in-laws, shared the truth with me. His mother and sister, he told me truthfully, resented the love he had to share among us, therefore they were jealous of me and my place.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Dot, \"you seem to have found a way around it, all right.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" agreed the woman, \"but it took both time and patience. My first move was to send John home frequently for a visit with his mother and sister alone. This hurt to the heart's core, but it gave them 212 a chance to discuss intimate things in which they felt at that time I had no share. Then I began inviting them to our home, and making them so thoroughly comfortable that they had no excuse for thinking I wanted to monopolize my husband's affections or to break him from his home ties. I made it a point to call his mother every morning, sometimes asking her to tell me John's favorite dish, and frequently requesting her, when she had told me, to come over and prepare it for the evening dinner.\n\n\"Then I began asking his mother to let me drive her when she wanted to run into town, or the sister to use my car, which was a wedding gift from my father. At first I was keenly aware they were puzzled over my attitude, but when they realized I was sincere in the matter, well\u2014\" she added softly, \"I simply became one of them, and we've lived in perfect harmony ever since.\"\n\nAfter that bit of information, Dot went home to do a little thinking on her own behalf. Three miles up the valley lived Dean's people. She had RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE\u2014MARCH 1948 been to see them twice, and his family had returned her visit both times, but there had been a chilly atmosphere between them.\n\nDean's mother was not her mother, nor was his sister her sister. 'They lived in their house,' and she and Dean lived in theirs; yet there were times when Dean had a faraway look in his eyes, and his firm lips drooped a bit at the corners. In a flash, Dot understood why, and resolved, as little Mrs. Joiner had done, she, too, would wipe out any sign of petty jealousy and become part of her husband's family. This took time, persistence, and patience, but today there is not a happier home in the valley than that of Dot and Dean Arnold, simply because Dot learned from her neighbors what it meant to tighten the marriage knot, and of her own accord she tightened the one binding her to the man of her choice.\n\nWhat about your own marriage knot? Is it slipping? Look well into the matter, and if it is, make an effort to tighten the knot before the cord breaks.\n\nBEAUTY Mabel Jones Gabbott\n\nThere were tall pines in the forest,\nWeighted with needles, of green.\nGreat, massive oaks stood between them,\nDwarfing the cedars between.\n\nAnd there was a slight, slender maple,\nGracefully tipped toward the sun,\nCalmly aloof in a clearing,\nWearing her scarlet and dun.\n\nPine needles carpet the forest,\nOaks make a windbreak for all;\nWhy am I cheered most, remembering\nThe slight, slender maple last fall?\n\nStamped quilt tops, floral designs. 7.98 and 8.98 Baby Quilts, 3.98 Stamped pillow, case tubing.\nCutwork and easy embroidery. 2.69 American Lady tufted rugs.

Indeed, it can, and should be,\nOften, in these days of zooming prices,\nThe meal itself. Too often soup is\nIgnored, unless st comes in cans.\nNot that canned soup should ever be spoken of lightly; It is one of the comforts and wonders of our age and should be well-stocked on the pantry shelf.\n\nBut now, we speak of soup as if we were first cousin to the French - soup that simmers gently and effortlessly on the kitchen stove. It is delicious to the taste, warming to the blood, and nourishing to the body and soul.\nTo know how to make it is to be a master of one of the finest arts of cooking.\n\nFor this kind of soup there is no definite recipe; The know-how is all important. Today, for those who are venturesome, we will try to con dense in a paragraph or so the knowledge we have gained from many pots of simmering soup stock.\n\nBasic Soup Stock\n2 lbs. Beef shank, cut in pieces\n1 veal knuckle\n1 cracked beef bone\nPage 214\nWater to cover generously\nHerbs, thyme, rosemary, parsley, basil, marjoram, bay leaf, chives, etc.\n5-6 peppercorns\n2-3 leeks, sliced\n1 large onion\n2 carrots, sliced\n3-4 stalks of celery, and celery leaves, dry or fresh\n1-2 whole tomatoes, or tomato juice\nWhole cloves\nSalt and pepper\n\nVariations\nVegetable soup\nTomato-rice soup\nTomato soup with pastes\n\nStart the soup cooking either the day before, or early on the day it is to be used. For the very best results, you should have a big pottery vessel. A porcelain kettle is next best; after that, a heavy aluminum kettle.\n\nCover the soup meat and bones well with water.\nYou may add as much water as you wish, but remember, the more water, the weaker the stock.\nLet the soup stand for one hour, then bring the kettle to a boil.\nLet the stock boil rapidly for a few minutes until the scum is formed. Now gently and patiently remove all the scum.\n\nAfter this, give the kettle a handful of salt and a few good shakes of pepper, and let it simmer gently for four or five hours.\n\nAbout midway in the simmering process, add the onion, into which the 3 whole cloves have been firmly pressed.\nAdd also, the carrots, cut lengthwise into about four pieces, the leeks, split lengthwise, the celery, the peppercorns, and the herbs.\n\nSeasoning, said a very great cook, should be done with grace, and grace applies particularly to herbs. If you are an herb enthusiast, you will need no advice.\nIf the art is new to you, use only a slight pinch until you become more expert.\nYou may use all the herbs listed above, and more, or only part of them, but use herbs.\nTie them in a little bag, if your soup is not to be strained.\n\nSoup - the Heart of the Meal\n\nNow, you have a basic stock with which you can do many things. First, however, remove the excess fat and the vegetables which were meant only for seasoning.\nYou may strain the soup and place it in the refrigerator for later use, or you may use it at once.\n\nFor vegetable soup, cut your vegetables finely - carrots, potatoes, string beans, celery, turnips, Italian squash, or fresh peas. Cook them in the stock just long enough to make them tender.\nNear the end of the cooking, add enough tomatoes, solid pack or juice, to suit your taste. You may also use a small can of tomato hot sauce.\nA package of frozen mixed vegetables may be used, or a can of mixed vegetables.\n\nSometimes you may care to add a cup of finely shredded cabbage about five minutes before the soup is removed from the stove.\n\nTomato-Rice Soup (Serves 6-8)\nSoup stock - 2-3 quarts\n1 pint of tomatoes (juice or solid), enough to suit taste\n1-2 cans of condensed tomato soup\n1 cup uncooked rice\n1 cup finely diced carrots\n1/4 cup shredded parsley\n\nCook these together until the rice is thoroughly tender.\nServe this soup, which is a hearty one, in colorful soup bowls, along with celery sticks and French bread.\n\nTomato Soup with Pastes\nTo the plain stock, add tomato juice with any number of the soup pastes: alphabet letters, tiny stars, melon-seed pastes, or the tiny shell-like pastes, vermicelli, or spaghetti.\nAdd to this, or any other soup, leftover vegetable juices.\n\nIf you are still willing to experiment, try making brown stock. This is done by rendering out the bone marrow and browning the lean meat in it.\nDried lentils, such as split peas, beans, lima beans, and garbanzos (chick-peas) are also good cooked in the stock.\n\nWhen the soup stock does not seem rich enough, don't be afraid to add bouillon cubes. Give the kettle plenty of salt and a farewell shake of pepper.\n\nClouds\nJeanette P.\n\nPany I love a wispy, chiffon cloud Wind-serried, soft, and white. In cobalt blue of sunset's glow That melts into the night. A flame-edged cloud at early dawn, Marking the new day's beam; Even a thunderous black one That hides a rainbow's gleam.\n\nPATTERN\n\nJohn M.

Roberts\n\nSomething in the eager child is sad\nAnd wise, and too all-knowing and resigned.\nAnd something in the older heart is glad\nIn dreams, despite his unbelieving mind;\nSomething incorruptible and good,\nSomething of creator that conceives.\nSome power captive in the restless blood\nThat shapes his far perfection and believes.\n\nJOSEPH WM.

Glory!\" was all he said, and in a frenzy of regret she threw herself into his arms. \"I do love you, Papa,\" she sobbed. \"Don't believe her when she says I don't love you. I love you more than all the world.\" One hand still held the paper to the light, and it was trembling. With the other arm, he drew her close against him. There was a queer note in his voice when he spoke, as if he were laughing and crying at the same time. \"Glory, you have killed my pecancy humor. We shall never use the word again.\" Marie and Levi exchanged glances. This was queer talk, even for Papa. \"It is good, isn't it? I mean really - good?\" Marie had forgotten her impatience. \"I'll bet anyone who has seen Starlight would recognize it,\" Levi added. \n\nPapa spoke to all of them. \"Some day this sketch will be exhibited as an example of the early work of a famous painter of animals in action. This is the most precious gift a man ever received.\" Gloria looked into his eyes and THE GIFT knew that something very special had happened to him, and it was her drawing that had done it. Once again that pain swelled and swelled inside her, but it was not pec'cy anymore.\n\nThe Basic-Seven Pattern for Nutrition (Continued from page 273)\n\nTo thicken soups, add a small amount of flour or cornstarch to cold water in a separate bowl, mix well, then stir into the soup. Use a wooden spoon to blend thoroughly. For gravies and sauces, use the same method but add more thickener as needed.\n\nWhole-wheat cereals and flour, brown, unpolished rice, oats, and other whole-grain products contain the \"enrichment and vitamins\" nature produced in them. They are more valuable as food and less expensive than synthetically enriched flours and cereals.\n\nFar-sighted home-makers will protect health by including daily in the family diet milk and milk products; fruit and vegetables; meats, fish, cheese, or eggs; cereals, whole-grain or enriched breads; butter, margarine, or other animal and vegetable fats. They will reduce expense by planting gardens and preserving food at home.\n\nWith \"prudence and thanksgiving,\" they will gather the harvest in the time of plenty \"in the season thereof\" and store it for the lean days to come.\n\nINSEPARABLE\n\nAlice Whitson Norton\nThrough age I've learned the solemn truth\nGay fairies are a part of youth;\nAnd though I know the truth it seems\nThey're still entangled with my dreams.\n285\n\nMY SERVICES ARE MY WAGES\nTwice as much for your money as you received twenty years ago!\nThat's what the average users of household electricity get in the territory we serve!\n\nUTAH POWER & LIGHT CO.\n\nAt your SEARS service.\nX CATALOG ORDER DESK SHOPPING SPECIALIST...\nTo answer questions, take measurements, help select items, write and mail orders.

It comes by a gift, words of appreciation, acts of kindness, or letters on the part of everyone. \n\nMother is a magic word, calling forth a train of memories in the mind of each individual, accompanied by a variety of emotions depending upon how some woman has fulfilled this sacred trust. Motherhood is a career of the first magnitude and is the instinctive ambition of every girl. Nature may endow her with the physical potentiality of motherhood, but to become an ideal mother will take the combined training of home, church, and school. \n\nAbove all must come her own realization of the tremendous responsibility which this sacred calling entails. Her physical, mental, moral, emotional, and spiritual development are of prime importance to the generation she mothers. To be daughter, mother, and grandmother is to make the destined cycle of womanhood and to know the joys, responsibilities, and development which these experiences bring.\n\nBecause they call for personal sacrifice and self-mastery, their value is enhanced. The child accepts the care and devotion of a self-sacrificing mother as his birthright. But the law of life exacts full payment for everything we get. This nurturing of our childhood may be repaid in part by loving devotion to parents, but the debt is never paid in full until the child\n\nPage 292\nbecomes the parent and so in turn cares for a succeeding generation.\n\nThe laws of God operate in perfect justice and bring happiness so long as we live in accordance with them. It is only when we selfishly seek to thwart them that troubles and disappointments come. The laws of compensation and retribution are never failing, though payment may be sometimes deferred. There may amass an ever larger and larger debt, but eventually it must be liquidated.\n\nWise indeed is the individual who pays as he goes in so far as this is possible. Love and you shall be loved. Serve and you shall receive service. \n\nProtective mother love is the guardian of youth, but protection too long continued makes for weakness, not strength, in the child. To watch the tiny, helpless infant grow and develop under your constant, watchful care is to see a miracle wrought. To live again in the enthusiasm and activity of youth with your children is to intensify and enrich life's drama.\n\nTo be counselor and protector, knowing when to assist and when to recede into the background, that your child may learn to walk alone, calls for almost superhuman wisdom. Wise indeed is the mother who has found the source of divine aid through prayer and who begins with the little child at her knee, teaching him to pray to our all-wise Heavenly Father for the strength which will protect him against the forces of evil.\n\nA true mother's objective is to teach and train wisely until she can say with assurance, \"My child is strong enough to walk alone with faith as his guide.\"\n\nLET EVERY DAY BE MOTHER'S DAY\n\nThat home is ideal where the true, spiritual perspective of life is the operating force. Not what is expedient or what will bring immediate satisfaction will be the governing factors, but what are lasting and eternal values.\n\nThe mother can do much to establish the spiritual tone of the home. She must first have deep-grounded faith herself. She must have become emotionally stabilized and self-controlled so that her own feelings may not interfere with the frictionless operation of her home. It will be she who arranges schedules so that there may be time for regular, peaceful, family devotion. \n\nShe must be persistent in planning and helping carry forward the family evenings, family picnics, and other occasions which will build family solidarity and common interests.\n\nOne of the greatest safeguards a child will have is the knowledge that his mother trusts him and that the family looks to him to maintain family standards and family honor.\n\nIT is more blessed to give than to receive\" is an axiom often misapplied by mothers. In their anxiety to serve their children they forget that there must be reciprocity in giving if all are to share in the blessings. If she insists on doing all the giving, she deprives her children of the joy of service.\n\nSome mothers enjoy being martyrs. They get a certain morbid satisfaction out of feeling that they do all the giving and take nothing in return. Mothers must learn to accept favors graciously and appreciatively that children may know this satisfaction.\n\n293\nOften it is easier to do a job than to accept the untrained help of children, but they can learn to do only by doing. At the other extreme are the spoiled, pampered mothers who feel that they have brought children into the world at great personal sacrifice and are justified in exacting unmeasured servitude in return. They continually complain of aches and pains. They are habitually tired, nervous, and irritable. They enjoy being waited upon and continually remind the children of the great debt owned to mother.\n\nBetween these two extremes is the well-adjusted mother who accepts motherhood as the greatest blessing and the greatest opportunity which life can offer. She takes good care of her own health that she may more efficiently care for her family. She is careful of her personal appearance, that her family may be proud of her, realizing that there may be times when it will be wiser to buy a new dress for herself than something extra for the children.\n\nShe knows that an immaculate house may not always be a happy home. She keeps up constructive interests outside her home that she may be a more vital and interesting individual. She remembers that she must be a good wife as well as a good mother, striving to keep abreast of her husband so that when the children leave the home nest, they too may still find true companionship in life's evening.\n\nFull measure of joy comes to the devoted mother when in her declining years she can look at her children, strong in mind and body, fortified in moral strength through a knowledge of God's commandments 294 and with the strength to live by his teachings with prayerful understanding.\n\nTo see them take their place with honor in church and community life and rear families of their own, gives her the joy of fruition. Her anxieties will not decrease, for she will feel responsibility for each new grandchild, but who wants the dull life where there is no anxiety? Her compensation comes as each of those she loves makes the climb to life's fulfillment.\n\nTHE aging mother who has given the full measure of care and devotion to her children should look forward unafraid to her declining years. Her greatest desire will be to maintain her independence to \"the end of her days, but she will look longingly for words of appreciation and love. She should not want to hold her children near, if greater opportunities are to be found in other localities, but she will be just as anxious to know of the daily activities of her children as she was when they were little and needed her care. Frequent letters and visits will give the joy that makes life worth living.\n\nHer hunger for affection and thoughtful consideration from her children is just as real as was their need for her when they were little, and this she gave unstintingly. And so the cycle of life repeats itself. The laws of life which God has given us, if we obey them, make this pathway one of gradual development and joy in accomplishment.\n\nThe loving, obedient child becomes the wise and helpful parent who merits, in turn, the love of thoughtful children grown strong. The once-a-year observance of Mother's Day should only serve to stimulate in us a greater appreciation for the responsibility of family life. The possibility that this special day may become commercialized is ever present.\n\nThere are those careless children who feel that they can make up for a year of neglect of their mother by lavishing upon her expensive gifts and attentions on this day. Mothers are appreciative and grateful, but nothing can take the place of consistent love and devotion. Flowers will fade, but the gift of a pure life dedicated to righteousness lasts through eternity.\n\nModest mothers accept the public acclaim and special attention with a feeling of reservation and humility. Motherhood has brought to them the greatest joy that can be known to woman. With that joy has come tremendous responsibility, and if she can feel that she has faithfully discharged her trust, she knows the peace and joy that passes understanding.\n\n\"Let every day be mother's day\" where there is love and understanding between mothers and children and where there is joy in companionship and service of each for the other.\n\nTREASURES\n\nMabel Jones Gabbott\n\nShe who has roused at night to heed the cries\nOf wakeful children, coaxing sleep-filled eyes\nTo open that she may attend their need,\nThough grumbling silently, is rich indeed.\n\nRelief Society Building\n\nREPORTS are constantly reaching the general board telling of the active part being taken by the brethren throughout the Church in supporting and encouraging the sisters in collecting their building fund quotas. For over one hundred years the sisters of the Church have labored to help erect Church buildings of all kinds which have been enjoyed by their sisters and their children and helped to build up the Church.\n\nNow the sisters are asking and receiving the support of the brethren in erecting a building in which the sisters may do the work asked of them by the brethren. As they work together in any righteous cause in the Church, the results are certain.\n\nAn interesting incident is related in one ward. Near the conclusion of the March 7 program \"Building For Eternity,\" one brother arose in the meeting and moved that the quota for that ward be finished that evening. This was seconded by a boy of eight and another brother and before the sisters left the building that evening, their quota was filled.\n\nA wonderful spirit of love and sacrifice on the part of the sisters had preceded that meeting. They had advertised throughout the stake that they would clean, scrub, baby tend, or cater for anyone in order to help earn the money and had raised a great part of the quota previous to the March 7 meeting.\n\nOther examples of the activities of the brethren are quoted below:\n\nA member of our bishopric remembered his departed mother who had been a faithful Relief Society worker. We were short a few partners for some of the districts, so the bishop went with one teacher and Brother................with another. On the date that was designated, we met as a group of visiting teachers with our bishopric and our stake Relief Society president. At the meeting our bishop told us of the benefits that would be derived as a result of this building, and of the privilege that had come to us as Relief Society sisters to be asked to help.\n\nMany brethren are giving memorial gifts to honor their mothers and wives, both to support the work so dear to their loved ones, and to know that the names of their wives and mothers will be preserved in the cornerstone and the records of the general board. The work of gathering the money is rolling on, gaining momentum as the months pass.\n\nPage 295\n\n296\n\nRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE MAY 1948\n\nEMIGRATION STAKE (SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH) COMPLETES BUILDING QUOTA, March 17, 1948\n\nFirst row, left to right: Emmeline B.

FOR DONATIONS TO BUILDING FUND\n\nThree types of cards have been designed as receipts to be filled out by ward Relief Society secretary-treasurers and presented to persons making contributions to the Relief Society Building Fund. The above card (to be printed in gold and white) which will bear the name but no designation of the amount of the donation will be presented to all Relief Society members who are credited with a quota donation or less.\n\nRELIEF SOCIETY BUILDING NEWS 301 302\n\nRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE MAY 1948\n\nThe first card pictured below (to be printed in pink and white) will be issued to Relief Society members who make a \"Special Gift\" (any amount over the $5 quota) and to all other persons making gift contributions. The amount of the \"'Special Gift\" will be recorded.\n\nThe lower card (to be printed in blue and white) will be issued as a receipt to all persons who make a \"Memorial Gift.\" Both the name of the one making the \"Memorial Gift\" and the one in whose honor the gift is made will be written, as well as the amount. These cards will be available for ward secretary-treasurers to issue to all persons who have paid up to April 20, after the receipt of the April 20 bi-monthly report and a request by each secretary-treasurer of the number of cards needed in her stake.\n\nAdditional cards will be mailed thereafter to stakes at two-month intervals as the bimonthly reports are sent in and reports are received of the needs in each stake for each type of card. Seven to One Geneva E. Wright\n\nThis isn't a scheme to get something for nothing. It is, however, a sure-fire plan which pays big dividends on a small investment. People say, \"I hate to write letters, but I love to get em.\" Being one of that class myself, I worked out a plan whereby I get seven letters back for every one I write.\n\nWith mature families scattered, since the war, all over this globe, many of them, like Humpty-Dumpty, will never be together again. Letters are the cheapest means of contact with them, but letters, even to loved ones, have a way of being spaced farther apart as time goes on, unless something special is done about it.\n\nMy scheme is an adaptation of the old \"round-robin\" applied to family units, and the bigger the group the better. Everybody in the family joins in writing a letter and adds it to the envelope as it reaches him. After it makes the rounds once, each person takes out his old letter and puts in a new one. And around it goes again!\n\nMany people have contributed to a round-robin at one time or another, which flew around on strong wings a few times, then fluttered weakly and died en route. But a family robin is a healthier bird, hatched as he is in a nest of affection, fed by seeds of kindness, and bathed in smiles and tears. His life expectancy should rate him A-1 on an insurance policy, and with a few crumbs of imagination and understanding sprinkled on the window sill for him as he makes his rounds, he should be good for many years as a messenger of family love.\n\nI was lucky enough to be born in a family of seven children, knit close by the needles of necessity into a fabric rich in pride and self-reliance. We all grew up eventually and \"married off,\" scattering from Florida to California, and when mother and father died, the threads which had held us together became tenuous indeed. Correspondence dwindled to a printed card at Christmas time or a cursory letter betimes, until the robin idea was finally hatched.\n\nSince then he has been flying high, making his visit about every three or four months, and when the big manila envelope arrives marked \"letter mail,\" there is always a family reunion of those living near. A brother in California writes that he is a cub scout leader and would like some Indian beads to decorate war bonnets for the cubs, and since I live on an Indian reservation, asks me to please send him some.\n\nAnother brother makes up a booklet of snapshots of his new home, beginning with a view of his wife and family welcoming us at the front door and taking us on a tour of each room, with appropriate remarks written underneath the pictures. A sister tells of her ensign son in the South Pacific and includes pictures and clipping of his adventures as published in the local paper.\n\nPage 303 304\n\nOther occurrences as graduations, special awards for achievement, and weddings are, of course, rich grist for the letter mill. One round is occasionally taken over by the in-laws, providing an objective viewpoint, for a change, and we see ourselves as others see us; and on another flight, the nieces and nephews do the honors.\n\nAnother sister is interested in family trees and keeps the births, deaths, and marriages of everyone down to the latest tick of the clock, besides delving into the family skeletons of the past to determine who fought where during the Revolution, and where the fighters came from before that. Poetry of a sort creeps into the letters when another sister can't express herself adequately in prose.\n\nThe weather and superior climate of various parts of the United States furnish many a hot debate, especially between Floridans and Californians. Quizzes and questionnaires proved diverting for a time and, of course, pictures are always a must. One clever letter was made up entirely of printed words, phrases, and pictures clipped from magazines and put together with finesse and imagination to fit the situation, and was good for a dozen chuckles.\n\nIn fact, there is no end to the variations which can be used to make each round a surprise. Naturally, the basis for all of this is the good newsy letter telling what Jane has been up to, that Dad just got over the flu, of the party that Sue attended and brought home the prize, and, most important of all, simply saying, \"I love you all.\"\n\nAn unwritten rule is that personalities and unpleasant topics, if any, are to be reserved for individual letters. The robin is a harbinger of joy and can thrive only when carrying pleasant messages. And, strangely enough, the urge to write some individual letters also has developed as a result.\n\nSomething Ruth says in her letter makes me want to tell of my experience, which wouldn't be of interest to the rest of the family, so off goes a separate letter to her, and thus the chain lengthens and strengthens. If your family relations need perking up, try starting a cheery round robin.\n\nHe makes sweet music and is a welcome lovebird, besides.\nSMALL BOY WITH NEW-BORN KITTENS\nKatherine Fernelius Larsen\n\nHe kneels, hands still for once, enrapt\nAbove the mother and her five;\nWondering at the squirming things\nSo small and softly warm alive!\n\nHe moves one finger just to touch,\nThen runs on urgent feet to tell...\nOnly to find words not enough\nFor his first miracle!\n\nNahaka Branch, New Zealand Mission, Sends \"Big Canoe' Quilt to President Spafford\n\nGENERAL\nPresident Belle S. Spafford and Sister Elva T. Cowley, President, Pacific Mission Relief Society, are shown admiring the unique quilt. Sister Cowley reports that when she first went to New Zealand the women knew nothing about the making of quilts. She conducted a campaign and taught them to quilt.\n\nThe central motif of this design depicts the large canoe which brought the Maoris to New Zealand. The names of these people are embroidered above their heads. Each of the outside blocks of the quilt was made by one of the sisters of the Nahaka Branch and has her name embroidered on it. Each block represents, also, a scene or a symbol representative of New Zealand.\n\nOne block shows the \"Tiki,\" which is a good luck charm of great significance to the people of the islands. Another block shows the flax plant which is very important as it is used in all the weaving and handcraft. Dyes for the flax strands are secured from the bark and roots of various plants.\n\nAnother block shows the ornamental fence which surrounds each small community in which the people live. The almost extinct Moa bird is represented, as well as other birds, trees, flowers, and animals peculiar to New Zealand.\n\nPage 305\n\nWhat About Cancer?\nJess H. Rolph [Prepared for the Utah Division, American Cancer Society]\n\nMany people know what cancer is, yet one person out of every eight in the United States dies from it, or as a result of its deadly action.\nTrue, there are many unanswered questions about cancer, many false notions concerning it, but, thanks to the work of the American Cancer Society, there is much we do know. It is not a disease that is infectious, nor does it enter the body from the outside, but, like the stealthy sneak it is, it comes from within!\n\nCancer has been defined as a group of normal body cells that start abnormal growth, pushing aside the other cells in their ruthless conquest of the body. Though the causes of cancer are varied, it is known that it never develops in healthy body tissue.\n\nFor example, irregularity of eating does not cause cancer, but it may result in unhealthy conditions within the digestive system, which sooner or later give rise to it.\nOne half of all cases of cancer are found in the digestive tract; approximately one-third are in the stomach. One factor in the development of this disease is continual or chronic irritation. It is as though the cells of some body tissue lose patience, break into open revolution, and begin building up their rebel army through cell division.\n\nThere are three types of irritants: chemical, thermal, and mechanical.\nOver-exposure to hot sun and high temperatures may be the cause of skin cancer. Constant rubbing of a mole, wart, or old scar may be sufficient mechanical irritation to cause rebellion and growth of malignant tissue.\n\nCertain people are more susceptible to cancer. Whether this is due to the faulty functioning of certain chemical substances in the body, or to some other condition, is, as yet, unknown.\nOne job of the American Cancer Society is to have research done on this puzzling phenomenon.\n\nCancer victims are to be found among young and old, men and women, married and unmarried. No age group is free from it. Babies are sometimes born with it and over two thousand people under twenty-one die of cancer every year.\nAmong men the danger zones for cancer are the lips, lungs, stomach, prostate gland, intestines, rectum, throat, and mouth. Among women the hazardous spots are the womb, breasts, intestines, rectum, stomach and genitourinary organs.\n\nAn unmarried woman is more likely to have cancer of the breast than a married woman who nurses her children, while cancer of the cervix occurs more often among married women who have borne children.\nCancer can be cured but only\nWHAT ABOUT CANCER?\nWhen diagnosed early and treated adequately!\n\nThere are many things you can do to guard against cancer. Many cancers can be cured if caught in time!\nThere are danger signals. Memorize these seven signs.\n\n1. Any sore that does not heal, particularly about the tongue, mouth, or lips.\n2. A painless lump or thickening, especially in the breast, lip, or tongue.\n3. Irregular bleeding or discharge from any natural body opening. Do not wait for pain. See your doctor!\n4. Progressive change in the color or size of a wart, mole, or birthmark.\n5. Persistent indigestion.\n6. Persistent hoarseness, unexplained cough, or difficulty in swallowing.\n7. Any change in the normal bowel habits. Do not attempt to diagnose yourself. Go to the doctor!\n\nA very good idea is to arrange for periodic health examinations for yourself and your family. Imagine the joy that knowing you are all right would bring!\nA thorough examination should include:\n\n1. Careful inspection of the entire body surface, heart, blood vessels, and a lung examination.\n2. Examination by sight and touch of all body openings that can be so examined, such as the mouth, nostrils, ears, throat, sinuses, vagina, and rectum.\n3. Examination of stomach and intestines by X-ray; microscopic examination of blood, urine, and any suspected tissue.\n4. Examination of the eye, bladder, prostate gland in man, and special examination of breasts of women.\n\nEducation on the subject of cancer is of utmost importance, and each state has a divisional cancer society. These organizations are supported by contributions from the public and every donation made goes toward furthering the study of and eliminating this dreaded disease.\nFamilies have been kept intact; breadwinners have been helped to stay on the job; emotional tragedy has been averted and financial suffering has been decreased.\n\nOnly you can save yourself from cancer. The cancer societies have but one mission to perform: through your contributions and the efforts of thousands of volunteers and active members, an endeavor is made to eliminate this scourge, cancer!\n\nPublic education, through the press, radio, literature, films, display, and public speakers, helps enlighten the public.\nAll this magnificent work is dependent upon the contributions made to the Cancer Fund.\n\nThree paragraphs which appeared in the Montana Cancer News express completely the feeling that goes into the making of contributions:\n\nIn religion we are taught that the good deeds we do on earth store for us jewels in a heavenly crown.\n\nBut I like to think that man need not wait for heaven to receive his reward. The well-known truism \"It is better to give than to receive\" has often been proven by the wealth of personal and spiritual satisfaction one acquires from giving of oneself freely in unselfish service to others. There is no greater fuel to feed the flaming fire of the human spirit than unselfish service to mankind: The server serves without thought of payment, but the joy of service and the knowledge that a job which needed doing has been done, brings its own reward!\n\nGive to the cancer society!\n\nSixty Years Ago\nExcerpts from the Woman's Exponent, May 1, and May 15, 1888\n\nFor THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ZION AND THE RIGHTS OF THE WomeEN oF ALL NarTIons\n\nTHE SALT LAKE SANITARIAN:\nWe have perused the prospectus of the Salt Lake Sanitarian, a monthly journal of medicine and surgery, about to be issued in this city. It will be devoted to the laws of life and health, diseases and their treatment. It will be edited by the Doctors Shipp, who are well known to the medical profession here, and have had quite an extensive experience in the treatment of cases in this Territory. These ladies are graduates of the Woman's Medical College in Philadelphia, and have made good use of their opportunities since they graduated, among the people here. That such a journal will be a desirable acquisition to the home literature of the Territory no one can deny. We wish these sisters every success in their new undertaking, and have no fears as to their capability to make the paper interesting and helpful to the people.\n\nEditorial\nUINTAH STAKE:\nThe first conference of the Relief Society held in Uintah Stake convened in the Ashley meeting house, April 1, 1888, with Sarah Pope presiding. Reports from the different branches were read. Sister A. K. Bartlett said that she felt this was a feast of rejoicing. Gave the sisters some good instructions concerning their daughters marrying; she said the daughters of Zion should go to the house of the Lord when they were married. Sister McAlling expressed her desire to do good, said she belonged to the first Relief Society that was organized in the Church. Counselor Hatch said she felt well in meeting with the sisters and gave them some good counsel. President Sarah Pope addressed the congregation on the duties of wives and mothers. She said: \"It is not right to be proud and haughty, but we should be humble and prayerful and learn to govern ourselves, before we are fit to govern others.\"\n\nAda Longhurst, Secretary\n\nTHE BLUE FORGET-ME-NOT\nThere is a flower which oft unheeded grows,\nAnd blooms unnoticed in some shady spot;\nModestly it hides, nor gaudy petal shows,\nBut whispers coyly to the breeze, \"Forget me not.\"\n\nThe bride should wear it when she leaves her home,\nThe dead should have it on their coffin laid;\nOur friends most prize it when afar they roam.\n\nM. A. Greenhalgh\n\nWHAT WE ARE CREATED FOR\nToo many of our sex think it necessary to cultivate only the external part of our organizations. That is why they seem to think if they adorn themselves with all the frills and furbelows of fashion, that they are very attractive, no matter how uncouth their manners. They do this to the total neglect of the mental and physical and, I am sorry to say, sometimes the moral parts of their beings also. The body is only a casket for the spirit to dwell in; the spirit is the immortal, imperishable portion which we have inherited from our Heavenly Father. Who ever heard of a person's name being known to posterity because of the beauty of her dress? All can study fashion, but those who spend most of their time in that may perish with their clothing, and are soon forgotten. Then while we have respect enough for ourselves, our associates and our God to be neat and clean in our appearance and pleasant in our intercourse, let us not spend too much time in adorning ourselves to the neglect of cultivating our minds and manners.\n\nAunt Bird\nPage 308\n\nWoman's Sphere\nRamona W. Cannon\n\nHE two scholars who most influenced the high moral pattern of Chinese thought were Confucius and Mencius (around 4oo B. C.). Both were reared by widowed mothers, to whom Chinese historians give much credit for the accomplishments of their sons. Mencius' mother early noted his talent for learning and imitating. He would re-enact the solemn scenes of burial, occurring in the near-by cemetery. When she moved near a market place, he pantomimed every phase of buying and selling. Finally, she moved near a college and found that her plan worked.\n\nKATHERINE ROMNEY STEWART (Mrs. Charles B. Stewart) aged seventy-two years, died January 19, 1948, in Los Angeles. For fifteen years she had the privilege unique among our women of practicing on the Tabernacle organ. As assistant organist to Joseph J. Daynes, she was always prepared to accompany the Tabernacle Choir. In 1903, attending the World's Fair at Chicago with the choir, she played for three days before the Women's Congress as accompanist for the vocal solos of her sister Mary (Mrs. Charles Ross), and individually as organ soloist. In Los Angeles, as branch president, then in 1923 as first stake president, she pioneered Relief Society work for twelve years. Her favorite impression of the Relief Society spirit was to gather up old folks and shutins for thoughtfully planned entertainments, or doing kind things in their homes. She was very devoted to her husband and eight children.\n\nGAIN an American woman has won a Nobel prize. Dr. Gerti Theresa Cori shared with her husband, Dr. Ferdinand Cori, the 1947 prize for medicine. Both are faculty members at Washington University, St. Louis.\n\nASSOCIATED Press editors selected Princess Elizabeth as Woman of the Year; as internationally most outstanding woman in her field: beauty, Barbara Jo Walker; science, Gerti Cori; drama, June Lockhart; radio, Dorothy Shay; public service, Eleanor Roosevelt; business, Dorothy Shaver (President, Lord and Taylor department store); education, Sarah Blanding (President, Vassar College); literature, Rebecca West (British author); movies, Ingrid Bergman; sports, Babe Didrickson Zaharias.\n\nELDORA J. MAUGHAN, of Preston, Idaho, has been appointed to the National Congress of Parents and Teachers.

She is the mother of seven active Latter-day Saints.\n\nPage 309\n\nVOL. 35\nEDITORIAL MAY 1948\nA Blessing for Women\nAs the season arrives for the discontinuance of weekly Relief Society meetings, there comes to a faithful member a feeling of release from the more arduous and exacting duties of the past eight months, and at the same time a deep sense of satisfaction for the benefit she has personally received and the good which has come to others as the result of her and her sister's work in Relief Society. It is a feeling separate and apart from the contemplation of participation in any other activity offered by women's groups.\n\nOne of the benefits to mothers which comes from Relief Society was voiced by a brother in a Relief Society meeting. He was praising the work of the society as a whole and then testified of the blessings which had come into his own home through the activity of his wife in Relief Society. He related that when their children were young it was necessary for him to be absent from the home a great deal. His wife spent so much time shut within their own walls with the responsibility of the children and the incessant caring for their needs, that finally matters came to such a crisis that their very married life was at stake. It was at this juncture that a Relief Society was formed in their vicinity and his wife became a member. Almost at once he found that her attitude had changed. Her outlook became broadened and she discovered that other women were going through the same experiences as she. As her interests increased, she found time to take thought for her own advancement and improvement. In addition to the self-development which came to her through studying the lessons, she experienced a feeling of satisfaction and fulfillment through the good she did to others as offered in Relief Society work. He ended his talk, in substance, with these words: \"I have always felt that our married happiness was saved by Relief Society.\" This testimony of one of the worths of Relief Society to women finds echo in the hearts of thousands of members\u2014and in the hearts of their husbands. The spirit of the gospel which permeates Relief Society meetings carries to each member, according to her desire and faithfulness\u2014understanding, enlightenment, and a truer evaluation of her own problems with the wish to solve them in all righteousness. A woman who allows trivial pleasures or worldly interests to interfere with her attendance and participation in Relief Society is partaking of the spirit of the foolish virgins who did not keep their lamps trimmed and burning.\n\nRelief Society was instituted by the Prophet Joseph Smith under the inspiration of the Lord. He knows the needs of his daughters and blessed them with the Relief Society. M. C. S.\n\nNOTES TO THE FIELD\n\nSummer Work Meetings is the desire of the General Board that a work meeting be held each month, as heretofore, during the summer period, June through September. Church Welfare sewing should take precedence over all other work activities.\n\nMagazine Subscription Percentages for 1948 to Be Based on January Enrollment\nEFFECTIVE for 1948, instead of the membership figures on which the Honor Roll percentages will be based being counted as of December 1948, they will be counted as of January 1948. This will allow the Magazine representative to obtain from the secretary, at once, the membership figures of January 1948 on which her Magazine percentage for 1948 will be figured. In this way a Magazine representative will know all through the year the number of subscriptions she must obtain in order to be on the 1948 Honor Roll. No longer will her standing be imperiled by new members being added near the close of the year.\n\nIt is hoped that this procedure will enable more Relief Societies to be on the Honor Roll.\n\nTOO DEEP THE PEACE\nMarijane Mortis\n\nThis soft spring day that lolls upon the grass,\nThis languid sun asleep, warm on the land,\nThis breeze upsetting startled leaves to pass;\nHere is a peace to seek and understand.\n\nThis day the earth spreads out her color quilt,\nUpon the hills, the seeded garden plot;\nAlong unguarded way the flowers lilt\nWhile nature paints a quiet beauty spot.\n\nAnd now I hear a sound that reaches up\nWhere flame-tipped blackbirds wing the topaz sky.\nIt does not matter that my own frail cup\nMust be the symbol faith will justify.\n\nI'll hold today as proof against the years,\nAnd peace will be too sweet... Too deep for tears.\n\nPage 311\n\nPlanning Food Buying for Health and Economy\nBernice Stookey, Linford Iron County, Utah, Home Agent\n\n[This article is published with the suggestion that mothers of missionaries will call it to the attention of their sons and daughters in the mission field. Ed.]\n\nDiets first for health, and then make adjustments to meet the family income. To be thrifty and wise in selection one must first know food values, not only of fresh foods, but of commercially canned and prepared foods. Radio programs, magazines, and newspapers are saturated with attractive advertisements, some of which are fraudulent half-truths which may deceive even the most intelligent. By heeding these deceptive appeals the homemaker may not only undermine health, but may greatly increase the cost of living.\n\nMany young mothers buy practically all fruits and vegetables already canned, especially for young children, although fresh fruits and vegetables may be wasting in their orchards and gardens, which could be cooked fresh, frozen, stored, or canned at home at a great saving. The needs and income of each particular family should determine the plan for health. The resources of a family living on a farm where fruits, vegetables, milk, eggs, poultry, and meats can be produced will cut living costs greatly. However, the extra time needed to produce and prepare home-raised food will require good planning for the work of the homemaker.\n\nBargain buying of food in bulk if storage space is available, buying perishable fruits and vegetables at the close of the day, or taking advantage of \"specials\" will also cut costs. Be cautious of specials on meats, fish, and poultry, especially ground meats. These foods deteriorate rapidly. The present high prices of these products may tempt dishonest sellers to destroy the odor of spoilage by adding harmful preservatives which also preserve the natural color. Spices and herbs, too, may be added to conceal the taste and odor of spoiled meat.\n\nCommercially prepared foods are great time savers, and are used a great deal by most homemakers. It should be kept in mind, however, that no frozen, canned, or highly processed food is as healthful as fresh food, but the careful planner will always include enough fresh foods to keep a balanced diet.\n\nClimate, season, geographical location, and transportation will determine the \"best buys\" in all foods, especially fresh foods. Homemakers will make a better selection and save time and money by planning food for several days at a time.\n\nFirst check supplies on HAND, then make out a shopping list. The picture chart of the \"Basic Seven\" pattern for nutrition published in the April Magazine will help inexperienced cooks plan menus for health and economy.\n\nAvailable supplies, Price, and necessary time for preparation will determine choice of ready prepared and fresh foods purchased. Try making 4 simplified list based on the following classification:\n\n1. Yellow and green vegetables\n2. Oranges, citrus fruits, tomatoes, taw greens\n3. Potatoes, and other fruits or tables\n4. Milk and cheese\n5. Meat, fish or poultry, 88% beans, or dried peas\n6. Bread and whole-grain cereals.\n7. Fats (animal and vegetable) dried\n\nFOLLOWING is a three-day menu and cost list for two missionaries.\n\n\n\nThe demonstration was given to a group of 274 missionaries leaving the mission home for their fields of labor in September. The menu meets all the requirements for health as advocated by the \"Basic Seven.\" A double boiler was used in cooking since missionaries usually have access to only a hot plate or single burner, or in foreign countries, a small space on the family cook stove. To conserve time and heat, cereals were soaked overnight and cooked in top of a double boiler. To save time in preparing the evening meal, potatoes were cooked in their \"jackets\" in the lower part of the double boiler while the cereal was cooking. Eggs were broken in a tea cup and set down in the cereal, or cheese could be melted in a tea Cup, making a \"three-story cooker.\" Rice pudding was cooked in the top part of cooker while vegetable soup was cooking in the lower part. The meals were planned to be quickly prepared. Canned, frozen, dried, and fresh foods were all used, and fresh, evaporated, and dried milk were used to demonstrate each type, each missionary having the equivalent of one quart of fresh milk each day. \n\nThe actual cost of the eighteen meals for three days was $5.10, including tax.\n\nTHREE-DAY MENU FOR TWO MISSIONARIES OR PERSONS OF SIMILAR ACTIVITY (Actual cost: 83c per day per person at September 12, 1947 prices).\n\nFriday:\nBREAKFAST\nOne large grapefruit\nCooked cereal\nSoft-cooked eggs\nBread\nButter\nMilk\n\nLUNCH\nPeanut Butter sandwiches\nSliced tomatoes\nRaw pear\nMilk\n\nSUPPER\nWarmed up potatoes with canned sausage\nChopped cabbage (boiled 4 minutes)\nBread\nButter\nSliced peaches and top milk\nMilk\n\nSaturday:\nBREAKFAST\nStewed prunes\nCooked cereal\nSoft-cooked eggs\nBread\nButter\n\n1 (Continued on page 347)\n\nMagazine Subscriptions for 1947\nCounselor Marianne C. Sharp Hanks and gratitude are extended to the officers, Magazine representatives, and to all subscribers of The Relief Society Magazine for the excellent work which has been done throughout 1947 in obtaining a subscription of 80,978. Faithful Magazine representatives have been blessed for the long hours of work which this record has required.\n\nIncrease in Magazine Subscriptions\nParticular appreciation is felt for the way in which the number of subscriptions has been maintained and even increased by 420 subscriptions over 1946, in view of the increase in subscription price to $1.50 as of July 1947. Once more Relief Society members have demonstrated their loyalty to the Society and appreciation for the Magazine.\n\nImprovement in Content\nThe general board is constantly endeavoring to improve the content of the Magazine and to give to Latter-day Saint women the opportunity of improving their writing skills, and have their work preserved through the pages of the woman's magazine of the Church. It seeks to impart a message of spirituality, so much needed in the world today, to promote the work of Relief Society and publish Relief Society lessons, as well as offering reading enjoyment and articles of special interest to the homemaker.\n\nHONORS FOR HIGHEST RATINGS\nSTAKES\nSouth Los Angeles Stake, 140%\nMagazine Representative Nancy M.

The stakes as a whole in 1947 made an average of 78%.\n\nNew Rates for Some Foreign Missions\nIn order to put the Magazine on a sound financial basis, it was found necessary to increase the subscription rate to $2 for Australia, Great Britain, Europe, New Zealand, and South Africa, because of postal rates.\n\nMAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR 1947\n\nMission Hurstville, Australian Mission\nManavu Ward, Provo Stake (Utah) 315\n350.....

Andrew's fianc\u00e9e, Jane Allison, is broken-hearted and fears that she will never see Andrew again.\n\nHEN Andrew and Hugh arrived at the wharf, some of their buoyancy left them. As they carried their luggage from the dray over to the ship, they became very serious.\n\n\"Let's set our things down for a time, and rest on this bench,\" Hugh suggested.\n\nEngland was different from Scotland. Nature seemed more controlled, subdued. The boys sat gazing at the soft, blue sky and the glorious sunset.\n\n\"More like a painted picture than the real thing,\" Andrew voiced his opinion. \"In Scotland those white clouds would soon get to tumbling over one another and scampering hither and yon.\"\n\n\"Aye, but look at that harbor. Things don't happen in the Forth the way they are happening out there,\" Hugh volunteered.\n\n\"I was just looking at it,\" Andrew responded. \"Ships, boats, tugs, running about, getting ready for the sea.\"\n\n\"They will soon be leaving for -about every port in the world.\" The boys watched the moving scenes, whistles blowing, men shouting orders, vessels moving from the docks, others taking their places.\n\nA Page 340 sailboat, like a bird with raised pinions, was gracefully maneuvering about. \"There's the ship Thornton,\" Hugh slowly reiterated. His eyes seemed fairly glued to the ship that was to take them to America.\n\n\"Well, there's the ship, and here's the ocean. It seems if we hang around for a time, we may take off for some place.\"\n\n\"You're right, Andrew.\" Some of Hugh's natural cheer returned. They arose, picked up their luggage, and began moving toward the vessel.\n\nThe ship was loaded with freight and several hundred passengers and the order of the hour was choosing permanent quarters. The bunks, upper and lower, reached all around the ship and down the center. The galley was on one side and tables were built and pegged on the stanchions, to be raised and lowered at will.\n\n\"Andrew! Hugh!\" It was Bob MacKinlay coming toward them as fast as he could push through the crowd. The boys smiled when they saw him, and hurried to meet him.\n\n\"We had a mind, if we looked about we would find someone we knew,\" Hugh said. \"Our bunk is over this way. There is an empty one next to it. Mother would like you to have it, so she can look after you. She would never be content with only one chick to scratch for. Will you come?\"\n\nQUESTING LIGHTS\n\n\"Will we come?\" Hugh laughed. \"Lead the way, your mother has just acquired a family.\"\n\nBob took them over to Mother MacKinlay who was happy to see them. They had often stayed at her home in Cowdenbeath when they were doing home missionary work.\n\nHE ship was fast filling up. Soon there would be more than six hundred saints aboard. Andrew slept well that first night. He woke early, and as Hugh was still asleep, rose and went on deck. It was a beautiful morning. The ship was rising and falling with the waves.\n\nThe elder's heart felt like that  rising because he was on his way to Zion falling when he thought of home and loved ones. Once again he wondered if he was doing the right thing. It would not be long until the ship would be sailing, then he could not turn back if he wanted to. He meditated for a few minutes, then went almost running to the bunk.\n\nHugh was making the bed. \"How long have you been up, Andrew?\" His friend did not answer. Hugh looked up. \"Come sit by me on the bunk. You are taking this trip too seriously.\"\n\n\"Andrew covered his face with his hands, trying for self-control. \"Let's have prayers, Hugh, before the saints begin moving about. You pray. I just can't this morning.\"\n\nThe boys knelt and during prayer peace filled their hearts. Andrew found his anchor.\n\nThe boys were hungry. The fresh, salt air was doing things to their appetites. 341\n\nHugh returned from the galley, half laughing. He handed Andrew his breakfast. \"Strange work for a Scotchman. I never served a meal in my life.\"\n\n\"Nor I,\" Andrew responded. \"That's what mothers are for. I guess we've taken our mothers too much for granted.\"\n\n\"By the way, Rumgay, how are your mother's scones this morning?\" \"Fine,\" answered his friend, \"and your mother's griddle cakes?\"\n\n\"The best ever!\" Hugh answered as he half-choked on his porridge, \"a special treat from our mothers this morning.\" Andrew washed the dishes and put the table in place. He opened his kist and took out his Book of Mormon and his father's hymn book, which his mother had given him as a keepsake. He opened the hymn book and for a time read hymns. He began humming some of the tunes. He had always wanted to sing the gospel.\n\nHe turned to his mother's favorite, \"Lead Kindly Light.\" He used to sing it with her. He began to sing, smoothly for a time, but when he got to the middle of the verse, he was at the end of the tune; when he got to the end of the verse he was in the middle of the tune. He tried again, with the same results.\n\nHugh came up unnoticed. Andrew determined not to give up and kept on singing. Shand, holding his sides with laughter, fell: on the bunk. He laughed until Rumgay began to see the funny side, too, and joined him in the fun.\n\n342\n\nTHE British mission president attended the priesthood meeting. Brother Byron Wood was chosen president of the company. Andrew Rumgay was made first counselor, and Erick Nelson, the second. William Walker was sustained as clerk. The president explained that the organization represented the conference in the mission field or the stake in Zion. Later, wards would be organized and fully officered.\n\nHe asked the people to take care of their health by cleanliness, right health habits, and by keeping the Word of Wisdom. After the meeting Andrew was greeted by the officers and his friends and acquaintances who promised him their help and support. He could not believe that it was true.\n\nHugh was delighted, for, as he told Andrew, the best way to forget one's own troubles is to help others solve theirs.\n\nThe shades of evening were falling fast on the harbor and on the city of Liverpool, on the towers of its churches, and on the joys and cares of its people. A tugboat was puffing and spouting, its lines fast to the Thornton.\n\n\"All ashore that's going ashore!\" Andrew's heart stood still. Could it be possible? Yes, the ship was moving. He went on deck. A fair wind was blowing down the river. The sails were being loosed to the breeze. Andrew watched the ship move forward first on the power of the tugs, then on its own power.\n\nHe stood in meditation and in prayer.\n\nThis life was like the ocean, every wave a second on the sea of time, and each persistently passing; the INLAND WAVE SOCIETY MAGAZINE MAY 1948 inland waves were moving towards home and security; the outgoing waves were strangely adrift. The responsibility of over six hundred people was divided. The officers followed the mission president's recommendation and divided the stake into wards and chose officers for each group. In this way the president could know the condition of every saint aboard. The Scotch Ward was asked for entertainment for one Friday afternoon and Brother Coleman, the choir leader, prepared the program. He chose talented members of the group to take part. These included Hugh who sang tenor and had thrilled so many Latter-day Saint gatherings in Scotland, Brother Coleman's daughter Kathleen, who had studied music in Edinburgh, and Fannie and Agnes Ramsay as highland fling dancers. The choir held several rehearsals and, after one of them, Hugh came back dancing and singing. \"Today I met the real Scotch heather. What a girl! Have you met Brother Coleman's daughter?\" Andrew looked up with a questioning smile. \"Don't tell me you've fallen again, Shand? I was thinking you were cured. You haven't been in love since we came aboard.\" \"Miss Coleman is different.\" \"That much I can say for them all,\" Andrew responded. \"Imagine meeting her right here on the Thornton,\" Hugh continued. \"Ladies travel the seven seas, too. There's no law against that,\" Andrew answered. Next morning Hugh was busy shaving, brushing his clothes, and getting ready to meet Kathleen Coleman. Andrew wasn't worried. \n\nQUESTING LIGHTS\n\nThis had happened many times before, and it would probably happen many times again. The saints had a good time at the party and after the program they danced until late. Andrew danced several sets, then went on deck. Hugh was having the time of his life dancing with all the girls, Scotch or not, and Kathleen Coleman certainly wasn't being neglected. Andrew watched them for awhile, then turned his attention to the ocean. The moon and stars were very bright. Andrew felt near to his loved ones. The skies tonight belonged to him and to Jane. The Scotch melodies from the organ, violin, and accordion rising from the steerage, mingled with the rhythm of the water, set his emotions in time and tune with his longing for his sweetheart.\n\n\"Elder Rumgay, we've been looking for you.\" It was Hugh, Kathleen Coleman, and her friend Margaret Purvis. \"Don't tell us you left the party to come up here to be alone. It doesn't say very much for our company, now does it?\" Kathleen Coleman asked. \"Does he love Andrew?\" Hugh was teasing. He knew how to get quick response from his friend. \"He spends half his time on deck all alone.\" \"I love the ocean more, if you can believe that, after listening to Brother Shand.\" \"Now we want to capture you, Brother Rumgay,\" Margaret Purvis was speaking. \"We can howl like the ocean, dance like the waves, and sing like the wind. Doesn't that sound inviting?\" Andrew was very much amused. 343 He was sure he liked Margaret Purvis.\n\n\"But,\" the young lady continued, \"wouldn't you just know that anything we could offer wouldn't compare with Miss Allison's charms?\" \"I wonder what the young lady expects, when she turns her man over to the wiles of scheming women?\" Kathleen asked laughingly. \"She's optimistic,\" Hugh added. \"I'm sorry to be so disappointing. I'll try and improve my ways,\" Andrew assured his friends.\n\nSATURDAY was a dark and cloudy day. The ship had just been cleaned from bow to stern and was as neat and shining as Mother Mac's proverbial new pin when they heard the winds blowing and the patter of rain on deck. Portholes were closed and hatches were bolted down. The air, not too good in the steerage when they had some ventilation, became stale and offensive when fresh air was shut out. The constant rocking of the boat, the confinement in the small quarters, the changed diet, were beginning to be evident in the health of the people who had been accustomed to outdoor life. They were used to getting up early and out to their work, in many cases the women going with their husbands to the fields, to the factory, and to the pits. Sunday was fast day and the time was given over to the saints for testimony bearing. If stormy days were taking a toll of their strength, their faith was just as strong and evident, perhaps even more so, than on fairer days.\n\nSeveral of the congregation led in hymns, some in prayer. One sister read, a poem:\n\nI am Zionward bound\nTo the saints' peaceful rest\nTo the valleys of Ephraim,\nTheir home in the West.\nFar remote from sin,\nOh, may God give me strength\nAll things to overcome.\n\nAndrew Rumgay spoke for a few minutes. \"As a child looks to its parents for support and comfort, so our Father in heaven expects us to look to him, casting all our cares upon the Lord, for he in very truth loves us. He bids us ask and we shall receive, to prove him and see if he will not open the windows of heaven to his children. He declares where there are two or three gathered together, they shall ask and his spirit shall be with them.\"\n\nThe storm continued. Monday morning found a large number of the emigrants ill, many of them seriously. The well volunteered to take care of the sick. Every ward tried to take care of its own. Andrew assisted every place possible. Night and day, he was at someone's bedside, following out the orders of the ship doctor.\n\nOne afternoon Andrew, tired out, went to the bunk to rest. Hugh wasn't up, and yet he wasn't sleeping. He was reluctant to answer the most casual question, saying he was just too tired. Andrew sat down on a box near the bunk. He felt Hugh's head. It was hot. \"How long has this been going on, young man?\" Andrew questioned. Hugh did not answer.\n\nAndrew thought, why don't the winds and rain stop? We haven't a chance in this gloom and darkness. He arose and walked over to INLAND WAVE SOCIETY MAGAZINE MAY 1948 Mother MacKinlay's. She had just come back from nursing the sick. \"It's the last straw, Mother,\" he said.\n\n\"What is it, Andrew?\" Mother MacKinlay asked. \"Are you ill?\"\n\n\"No, but Hugh is. His life is more precious to me than my own. He's mother, sister, brother, sweetheart, wrapped up in one. What are we going to do, Mother?\"\n\n\"Well, you are going to stop your worrying, this very minute, and bring the elders. We will begin right now to take care of him. You remember, Andrew, when two or three shall ask, it shall be given.\"\n\n\"Sometimes, Mother, it's so very hard to have faith.\" The elders, Brother Wood and Brother Nelson, came and administered to Hugh. The doctor came as soon as he found time. Brother Nelson volunteered to stay with Hugh all night as Andrew had to have some rest.\n\nMother MacKinlay would not leave the sick boy and she assisted Brother Nelson. The winds went down and the skies cleared, yet Hugh remained a very sick man. Mother Mac could see that the doctor was very worried, and she was worried, too. Finally, through prayer and fasting, a great change came over Hugh. His face became natural, his temperature began going down, and the hearts of the watchers were filled with joy and thanksgiving. ANOTHER week, and Hugh was out of danger. Kathleen still watched at his bedside. Every afternoon she would read several chapters out of Andrew's books to him. The sun was radiant in the skies; HEALTH AND THANKSGIVING were in the hearts of the people. Day after day the reading continued. Andrew was beginning to wonder if his friend would ever get well, but in time he got about again, and became strong and well. One afternoon Hugh asked, \"Have you ever been best man at a wedding, Andrew?\" \"Indeed, I have not, and probably never will, until I'm best man at my own,\" Andrew answered. \"That's where you ate wrong, sir, for I'm asking you to be best man at mine.\" \"Hoot mon,\" Andrew returned, \"what is this that the lad is saying? Hardly has his voice changed, and he jokes about marriage.\" \"This is no joke. Kathleen and I are going to be married Wednesday afternoon. We talked it over with Brother Coleman tonight. He thinks it's fine.\" Andrew sat on the bunk, almost stunned for a moment, then he arose and went on deck. The low song of the swells was soothing. The moon was at its zenith; the water white-black, as it played with the moonbeams. A ship was a dreaming thing; it brought fairy folk over the crest. Then carried them away, as far as King's Kettle. Now in the moonlight he saw Jane coming towards him. She seemed so close to him that he could reach out and take her in his arms, then she was far away in the dimness of the night. He was alone. Everyone was sleeping, but the watch at the wheel, the waves, and himself. The night seemed long, quiet, and lonely. His friend was to be married. 345 It was different to plan a wedding. The saints had been living 'the dark side, the serious side, now they switched to romance and happiness. Captain Collins invited Kathleen and Hugh to be married on deck because they were the handsomest couple ever to be married on the Thornton. The Scotch people decided to make it a grand affair. The women began putting their heads together. One came with a beautiful wedding dress. It had to be altered, but soon it was made to fit perfectly. Another brought treasured flowers, a third a pair of slippers. It was a beautiful wedding party that stood at the improvised altar. President Wood was waiting. \"And for Bonnie Annie Laurie I would lay me down and die!\" were the strains of music sacredly played, as Kathleen and Hugh happily answered, \"I do.\" The Captain ordered the American colors hoisted. A program of music, songs, and Scotch solo dances followed, and then refreshments. Andrew's contribution was Jane's fruit cake and shortbread. Andrew had intended to return to his bunk after the ceremony, but after the program he danced with Kathleen, and, as he couldn't be rude, he then danced with Margaret, and so the dancing went merrily on. Everything was forgotten but the rhythm and harmony of the dance. Andrew sat one out and Margaret joined him. \"Oh, I think everything is so wonderful tonight. Kathleen and Hugh are so happy. They are so suited to one another, a perfect couple, I would call them.\" 346 \"They are fortunate in finding each other.\" \"You are wonderful, too,\" Margaret modestly addressed the young elder. \"You were so helpful during that terrible siege of sickness. Not many saints aboard the Thornton will ever forget you.\" Andrew was surprised and confused. \"You're very kind, Sister Purvis. You know the Scotchman's weakness it's hard for him to be useful around women folk. The lassies spoil their men.\" \"Well, they seem to have missed you,\" she responded. \"But we are letting the music go to waste, Sister Purvis will you dance?\" \"I'd love to, Brother Rumgay.\" \"If a body meet a body Comin' through the rye, If a body kiss a body, Need a body cry.\" The party began breaking up. \"Happy sailing, Hugh and Kathleen,\" everyone was shouting. \"Happy sailing!\" Margaret and Andrew echoed as he left Margaret at her ship home. \"Happy sailing,\" Andrew prayed aloud, as he folded his Sunday clothes and put them back into the kist. His friend and companion was married. Ew OK HE day after the wedding, work was the order of business for everyone strong enough to help RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE MAY 1948 with the making of tents, and tops for their handcarts. The patterns had been made and cut, now the material had to be measured, cut and sewed. The steerage hummed with busy people. It was wonderful just to have something to do. The work was hard. It made sore hands, and aching backs. Days ran into weeks. They were nearing the other side. One morning Margaret went almost running past Andrew's bunk. He had been reading. \"What's your hurry, Margaret? No use running on shipboard. Time is the one thing we have in quantity.\" \"Not any more, Elder Rumgay. The captain was just saying if it wasn't for the fog on the harbor, we could see the lights.\" \"Oh, that is good news!\" \"Margaret, it hasn't been such a bad trip, yet I'm longing to set foot on the sacred soil of America.\" \"Oh, if it's just land, Brother Rumgay, any old land. Many nights I have thought the ship was sinking.\" Margaret went running with the news to Mother Mac and Kathleen. Soon the ship was moving slowly into the harbor. Once again came the pilot and the tugs. \"That's the way I have been guided all of my life by my Pilot and Tugs to the shores of Zion.\" Andrew gratefully thanked the Lord. (To be continued) FOR THE BEREFT Christie Lund Coles These words are for those who have lost their love, Who must walk bereft the whole world wide With only their courage for sustenance And their pride.\n\nPlanning Food Buying for Health and Economy (Continued from page 312)\n\nLUNCH: Beef and vegetable soup (soup bone, 6 carrots, 2 onions, 3 potatoes, outer leaves of cabbage)  \nSliced tomatoes Bread Butter Rice pudding with raisins Milk\n\nSUPPER: Soup left from lunch Bread Butter Rice pudding left from lunch Milk\n\nSunday: BREAKFAST Cantaloupe Cooked cereal Soft-cooked eggs Bread: Butter Milk\n\nLUNCH: Creamed peas (frozen or canned) Tuna, and potatoes Sliced cucumber Bread Butter Milk Grapes\n\nSUPPER: Creamed peas, tuna, and potatoes left from dinner Bread Butter Sliced peaches and evaporated milk Milk Cup cakes\n\nNote: Two tablespoons of dried milk were added each day to the cereal after it was cooked; % cup was used in the rice pudding; and % cup in the creamed peas, and tuna, used on Sunday.\n\nCompare this well-balanced, carefully selected diet with this poor example of food buying for families with low incomes. Actual cost, September 1947:  \n1 pound shelled pecans $2.50  \n2-8 oz. Cans lobster at 1.05 2.10  \n1-4 OZ. Can mushrooms 42 5-02 tax +10 Total $5.12\n\nFamilies with sufficient incomes could afford \"luxury\" foods as shelled pecans, lobster, and mushrooms, but there would be no more food value in the pecans than in a pound of peanut butter, no more value in the lobster than in tuna. Missionaries who wished to spend more for food might add more meat, liver, butter, cream, prepared desserts, etc., but this three-day diet as planned meets health requirements.\n\nFOOD LIST WITH COSTS FOR THE THREE-DAY MENU FOR TWO MISSIONARIES  \nCereal oatmeal or cracked wheat $.06  \nBread 3 loaves +39  \nButter 1/4 pound 44  \nPeanut butter 1/4 pound 12  \nMilk 3 quarts 51  \nMilk z cans 24  \nDried milk 1 1/2 cups 112  \nSoup Bone about 1% pounds -30  \nCarrots 6.06  \nOnions 2.02  \nPotatoes g medium 12  \nCabbage 1 pound (1 small head) 10  \nPeas 1 package frozen.20  \nBrown Rice 1/2 cup 04  \nRaisins 2/3 cup  Prunes 22 dried.

There was little change except seasonal changes to be expected in fruits and vegetables. In October, due to surpluses on the market, lettuce was special at 3c a pound; cauliflower, 6c a pound, tomatoes and cucumbers had passed the peak and were raised to 23c a pound; head lettuce was used in place of tomatoes and cucumbers, cauliflower in place of cabbage; fresh peaches were so high, canned fruit was substituted; squash was the cheapest yellow vegetable in November, celery the cheapest green leafy vegetable. Pears and grapes remained the same price during October and November but were higher in December. Oranges and apples were the best buys in raw fruit in December. Cabbage, potatoes, and tomato juice the best in their respective groups.\n\nRegardless of location, the \"Basic Seven\" given by the United States Department of Agriculture is our best food pattern. It may be altered to meet family needs and incomes, but is fundamental as a guide in planning food for health.\n\nLEGACY  \nGene Romolo A legacy of love cannot be lost As other legacies may disappear, For they who build it never count the cost Of their heroic efforts year by year. The memories my mother left to me Are like bright tapers burning through the night Before a shrine within a sacristy They fill my life with such a lovely light! I think of mother banishing her tears With voice of song, and answering demands Of life with patient faith in the lean years That stamped work's dignity upon her hands. These memories, with others left to me, Are my imperishable legacy.\n\nFREEDOM'S LOAVES  \nHallie Grigg Heaven may use methods By men, not understood; Five loaves and two fishes Once fed a multitude.

Sister Martin was president for twenty-eight years. Sister Johnson has served as treasurer and as a visiting teacher.\n\nThe minutes of this society, through the years, show many interesting accomplishments, such as the gradual development of the welfare plan from the time the women went visiting with a baby on one arm and a basket for gathering contributions on the other arm.

Utah\n\nA HOUSE BY FRIDAY \"Are you certain you wish it?\" she asked anxiously. \"It is too much for me, too upsetting of the head and heart, too much work for the maids, to have to rent it again soon. You will be satisfied? You will not want everything changed?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, so happy I was scarcely breathing. \"It is my house. I felt it as soon as I saw it. Each night I have said a little prayer that if it were right for us to have it, you would say yes.\"\n\nHer eyes grew soft. \"Each night I, too, have said my little prayer that I would find the right ones to live in my house.\" Her face brightened. \"You may have the house if you wish it.\" Tomorrow, she said, was short notice, but we could move in. If the maids could not have everything in readiness, we could be patient, no?\n\nAt night we came to arrange about the lease. It would be ready in a day or two, she told us. She came to a quick understanding with my husband about the Diplomatic Proviso. Then he drew out his checkbook to pay the first month's rent. She waived it aside. Time enough to pay it, she insisted, when we were settled and the lease signed.\n\nThe moon was shining when we passed through the garden. We stood by the fountain, savoring this moment when we no longer felt like intruders in an alien land. The difficult part of our Mexican move was over.\n\n\"Yes,\" Mr. Tarlock said to one of the American men we met as we passed through the lobby with our bags the next day, \"we have our house. Got here on Friday night and we're moving in this Friday noon. My wife did it all herself, too. Couldn't speak a word of Spanish, either. Just had to let herself go and she did it.\"\n\n429 Personal.. We are growing... We are developing... We have kept our stores modern, but we have not forgotten personal old-time courtesy.

Her story \"The Visitors\" appeared in March 1948, and 'The Kidnaping,\" in October 1947. Under her maiden name Fay Ollerton, she wrote stories and articles for the Magazine under the editorship of Ahce L. Reynolds and Mary Connelly Kimball. She is a graduate of Brigham Young University and holds a master's degree in English from Columbia University. Mrs. Tarlock, the mother of a young son, hves in Orinda, near Berkeley, California. Gladys Hamilton, Durango, Colorado, author of \"Far Country,\" has had her poetry, stories, and articles appear in more than twenty national publications She is a member of the National League of American Pen Women and the Poetry Society of Colorado. May I compliment you on the beauti-ful poetry the Magazine contains. It is heartening for those of us who write to find publications of your caliber using verse. I especially liked \"For Some Ap-pointed Reason\" by Berta Huish Christen-sen and \"Too Frail a Lute\" by Eva Willes Wangsgaard in the February (1948) issue. \ufffd Elaine Swain, Vallejo, California I am a convert to the Church and have been in America since 1923. I have taken the Magazine since 1927 when my first poem was published and loved it ever since, and suspect I shall all my life. I am English, but I dearly love the temple spires, the snow-capped mountains, and the beau-tiful new, white [aluminum] roof of the Tabernacle. \ufffd Helen Hall McQuarrie, Salt Lake City, Utah We do appreciate the inspiration that the general board gives to us in various ways. The March Relief Society Magazine alone is worth the $1.50 for a year's sub-scription. Every person I have talked with since it came I have encouraged to read it from cover to cover. \ufffd Jennie M. Butler, Secretary Snowflake Stake Relief Society (Arizona) Page 432 Allow me to send greetings from the heart of Europe. So many things have happened in this small country within the past few months. May I say that the Maga-zine brings me a great deal of joy at this time, since it keeps us up to date on Relief Society affairs at home. The Magazine is one of the fine publications that comes through the censor and I do enjoy reading its uplifting and educational contents. \ufffd Martha S. Toronto, President Czechoslovakian Mission Relief Society Prague Thank you for publishing my story \"A New Stove for Mother\" in the April Magazine. It was really an honor to have it included in that issue. I enjoyed read-ing the stories by the other ladies. As I was reading, I thought how nice it would be to meet and know some of the other writers who help make up the Magazine. I truly appreciate the help and encourage-ment which the editors have given me. \ufffd Norma Wrathall, Grantsville, Utah INEZ WHITLOCK MAKES 150 QUILT TOPS FOR RELIEF SOCIETY During the past ten years.

Widtsoe), Deseret Book Company. The Gospel Kingdom (Selections from the Writings and Discourses of President John Taylor, compiled by G. Homer Durham) Bookcraft. The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff (Selected and Arranged by G. Homer Durham), Bookcraft. Gospel Doctrine (Selections from the Sermons and Writings of President Joseph F. Smith), Deseret Book Company. Gospel Standards (Selections from the sermons and writings of President Heber J. Grant, compiled by G. Homer Durham). Published by The Improvement Era. The political utterances of Joseph Smith are classified and explained in Durham, G. Homer: Joseph Smith: Prophet-Statesman, Bookcraft, 1944. They are likewise to be found in Smith, Joseph Fielding, The Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, Deseret News, 1938, with the exception of a few public documents. Teachers will find the current output of Church books, magazines, and conference reports invaluable sources for lesson enrichment. In addition, specific suggestions are carried in each lesson, together with questions for general discussion. If the claim that \"the world's problems\" can be solved by reference to gospel principles is to be realized, these lessons and materials have deep meaning. In these lessons the term State is commonly used to indicate an independent sovereign state (nation). Note: A lesson is outlined for Tuesday, February 22, 1949, since some Relief Societies hold their meetings on days other than Tuesday. It is suggested that Relief Societies which meet on Tuesday present the February 22 social science lesson on March 22 and the March 22 lesson on the fifth Tuesday, March 29, or combine the February and March social science lessons and present them together on March 22. The titles and objectives of the lessons follow: Lesson 1. The Meaning and Importance of Political Doctrines Objective: To point out the modern tendencies in political thought to ignore spiritual resources and to seek a cure-all through unlimited government. Lesson 2. Some Political Doctrines of the Book of Mormon Objective: To learn, from a study of political doctrines expressed in the Book of Mormon, that a government to be good must be composed of good people. Lesson 3. Political Ideas Advocated by the Prophet Joseph Smith Objective: To better appreciate the political doctrines advanced by the Prophet Joseph Smith. Lesson 4. \"The Declaration of Belief Regarding Governments and Laws in General\" Objective: To study section 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants as the belief of Latter-day Saints in regard to earthly governments and laws in general. Lesson 5. Main Currents in Latter-day Saint Political Thought as Revealed in Discourse and Literature Objective: To appreciate the contributions to political thought voiced by some of the early Church leaders. Lesson 6. Contemporary Domestic Problems Objective: To recognize the limitations of the State in its ability to solve problems. Lesson 7. International Strife and the Quest for Peace Objective: To appreciate the part some Latter-day Saints have taken in recent political activities and the obligation resting on Latter-day Saints to teach their children the doctrines of free agency and liberty in harmony with Latter-day Saint knowledge. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE\u2014JULY 1948 Lesson 1-The Meaning and Importance of Political Doctrines Elder G. Homer Durham For Tuesday, October 26, 1948 Evan Jensen The watchword of traffic safety is courtesy.\" This slogan appeared at the crossing of a busy intersection recently. The thought behind it appears trite at first. On closer examination we see the modern social problem in a nutshell. Man's material development has outrun his spiritual. Take the example of traffic, which kills and maims someone every minute. How do we try to solve this problem? Largely by car inspections, superdivided highways, and other materialistic means. This is why the sign, \"The watchword of traffic safety is courtesy,\" caught my eye. We must mobilize our spiritual resources! Which would you rather face, head-on, in oncoming traffic, a driver in a jolopy, with courtesy extending from him to you; or, a discourteous, ribald person in a thirty-ton truck? Objective: To point out the modern tendencies in political thought to ignore spiritual resources and to seek a cure-all through unlimited government. And-trailer engineering marvel? Or vice-versa? If safety and courtesy are desired on the highway, what about courtesy in the use of battleships and bombs? Predominance of the Material Over the Spiritual Just as the modern approach to most problems emphasizes materiality over the spiritual resources of man, so does the modern State and its government exemplify a similar triumph. In case of conflict between two nations the questions usually asked are (1) What are their resources, especially, coal, iron, and petroleum? (2) What is their industrial production and capacity? (3) What is their population and birthrate? Resort is then made to force. The spiritual qualities of the two peoples concerned, their capacity at tolerance, forbearance, and compromise are rarely considered or utilized. Rather they are exploited, devilishly, in support of the material factors in the contest. Mankind's spiritual and material needs cannot be separated. But the emphasis given these aspects of human living should definitely subordinate the material to spiritual ends by spiritually motivated means, and not in reverse order. LESSON DEPARTMENT Increase in Material Functions of Government Today the material functions of modern government outstrip all others. Men have come to rely more on the State for \"salvation,\" bread, security from hunger, disease, cold, atomic bombs, and the effects of their own indiscretions, than on any other thing. Accordingly, men search for adequate doctrines both to guide the State and to judge its operations as \"the way out.\" These doctrines, more and more, reflect a totalitarian approach; namely, that the effective solution lies through governmental action, therefore all other possible means must be subordinated, if not absorbed, by the State. What is the nature of the State? What are its limitations? What is the sphere of effective State action? How should governments be run and controlled? This is the age of politics and political problems. What contribution does Latter-day Saint thought make in answer to these questions? What is the gospel, viewed in relation to these problems, and what are the gospel applications? Is there a \"true\" or better way of running governments as there is a \"true\" way of baptism and administering the sacrament of the Lord's supper? Or is the effective reach of the gospel confined to a few simple ordinances and individualistic beliefs having no connection with the War Assets Administration, British loans, the Politburo*, or revolution in Indonesia? A consideration of these and allied subjects will form the basis for this year's course of study. Contributions of the Past From the Greek world we derive one of the great political ideas of all time, limited government, meaning that government should be confined to set limits in order that power (which tends to be arbitrary) can be controlled for man's benefit. The Constitution of the United States is perhaps the world's greatest fulfillment of this idea. It confines government to certain channels, and forbids it to enter others (for example, those freedoms protected by the Bill of Rights).\n\nMoreover, taught Aristotle, even limited power should be divided, with checks and balances\u2014\u201cmixed government\u201d\u2014in order to achieve political stability. Otherwise men are subordinated to the will of their rulers with the result that men serve the State rather than the State serving man. The President of the United States, for example, must have authorization from Congress in the form of a law before, normally, he can act. Then the courts may review any executive procedure thereunder. Expounded first by Aristotle, these general ideas are the foundation of constitution-making and constitutional government.\n\nThe Roman world, though absolutist, nevertheless carried through an idea which moderns speak of as \u201cthe rule of law,\u201d namely, that State action must conform to law. Too often among the Romans, law could be the whim of the emperor.\n\nThe inner executive committee or controlling body of the Russian Communist Party, and the bureau of foreign Communist propaganda, 492\n\nBut by English times, the Greek and Roman doctrines had merged to recognize that good law, while conforming to natural or divine principles, must yet be agreed upon\u2014in advance\u2014by the people. Thus, twin ideas, limited government and government by consent of the governed, became the modern inheritance. Both are expressed in the Constitution of the United States.\n\nThe Crisis in Recent Political Thought\n\nAs inventions have multiplied, men, particularly since about 1870, have turned to the State to regulate, control, and now\u2014plan the results accruing from the concentration of population in big cities and other revolutionary changes. Using the doctrine of \u201cgovernment by consent,\u201d the people have gained control of their governments. Then they have asked (spurred on, many times, by scheming men) their governments to do this, then that, then the other thing, until the National Government of the United States alone has been looked to, not only by most Americans, but by peoples in Europe and Asia, as the means of solving all problems. So, State functions have increased enormously, not to mention the influence of socialistic doctrines.\n\nWhat has happened to \u201climited government\u201d? It appears to have become instead, by means of man\u2019s resorting to the State, a doctrine of unlimited or total government! Can we have unlimited government and preserve the human rights, so precious to the advocates down the centuries, of limited government? Human experience teaches us differently. This is the crisis of modern political thought.\n\nThe Need for Nurturing Spiritual Attitudes\n\nWithin this crisis congregate the problems of modern society because our many social institutions have become so enmeshed in the machinery of the State that any break-up of government threatens to dissolve society. To alleviate this situation, there is powerful need for spiritual attitudes: courtesy, kindliness, forbearance, tolerance, mutual understanding, faith in God and in each other.\n\nSuch social institutions as the family, business corporations, labor unions, professional societies, farm bureaus, trade associations have\u2014in the spirit of the times\u2014come to rely more and more on government to settle and support their affairs. Juvenile delinquency, adult delinquency, divorce, broken homes, industrial strife\u2014all too often we seek remedies through passing laws, setting up agencies and bureaus, when what is also needed is a nurturing of man\u2019s fundamental religious nature.\n\nDivorce involves two holy beings, a man and a woman. The juvenile delinquent, the striking miner, the recalcitrant employer, all are children of God, with deep wellsprings of spiritual power. What is being done to keep this power alive and functioning? If the forces of materialism through the unlimited State come to dominate our lives completely, what forces can then be free to operate in the effort to fulfill the great spiritual needs of men?\n\nThe State may try, often in a totalitarian way, as in Hitler\u2019s Germany. But man is of such diverse outlook that spiritual freedom is perhaps his most precious freedom. So again, here is the crisis of modern politics and of modern thought.\n\nWhat paths lead from this dilemma? This is the approach we seek.\n\nQuestions for Discussion\n\n1. What is meant by \u201climited government\u201d?\n\n2. Does the doctrine of \u201climited government\u201d imply that there are limits on \u201cfreedom\u201d as well as on government? For example: Can society tolerate absolute freedom? Can a person, or group, do anything he pleases or must persons and groups accept certain responsibilities?\n\n3. A main problem of government is to maintain the balance between freedom and authority. What are some of the limitations on personal freedom that might be considered desirable?\n\n4. What are some possible limitations on personal freedom that might be considered undesirable?\n\n5. What important human problems can you think of that governments must, of necessity and with satisfaction, solve?\n\n6. Can you think of some human problems that cannot effectively be solved by governmental action?\n\n7. How does governmental action differ from other forms of organized human activity? Does it differ in any respect? Why or why not?\n\nOptional Lessons in the Field of Social Science\u2014The First Presidencies (Primarily for use outside Continental United States and its possessions)\n\nTHE PRESIDENCY A UNIT\n\nTHE THREE ARE ONE Elder T. Edgar Lyon\n\nPreview of Lessons for 1948-49 OUR course of lessons for this and the ensuing year is to be devoted to a study of the First Presidencies that have guided the destiny, under the hand of God, of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nThese men were strong men, men of faith, men possessed of leadership ability and determined that God\u2019s work should be foremost in their lives. Two or three of the early leaders were not strong enough to withstand the persecutions they were called to endure, nor were they unselfish enough to lose all for the gospel, and they became critical of the Prophet, estranged from the saints and lost their influence with the people. They were replaced in their positions of authority by stronger and more faithful men.\n\nBut while they remained true, they were instruments in the hand of the Lord in furthering his work. One of the unique features of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is its plan of lay-leadership. Just as in the days of the Apostolic Church its leaders were drawn from men who made their livelihood from the various occupations of the day. Some continued to pursue their vocations along with their Church work until the end of their mortal administrations.\n\nIt was to be a Church of its people\u2014in which the members could be mutually helpful in working out their salvation. The Lord\u2019s Church, however, demands centralized guidance and a regulation of the Priesthood authority, divinely restored to the earth, otherwise the very power of its democracy and lay-leadership would lead to schisms that would destroy it.\n\nSo the Lord established by revelation presiding quorums through which is given divine guidance for the Church in all its activities both spiritual and temporal. Foremost among these presiding quorums is that of the First Presidency of the Church. The President of this quorum is defined in the Doctrine and Covenants as the \u201c... pre-siding High Priest over the High Priesthood of the Church\u201d (107: 66).\n\nPrior to the organization of the Church, John the Baptist instructed Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery (May 1829) that they should be called respectively the first and second elders of the Church (D.H.C. (1, 40-41). The Prophet Joseph was President of the Church from April 6, 1830 to the day of his death. It was in November, 1832, that a First Presidency of the Melchizedek Priesthood was announced (D&C 68:15). But it was not until March of the following year that Joseph Smith was called by revelation to this Presidency (D&C 81:1-3). A month or so later (April 1832) at a conference held in Missouri, he was acknowledged President of the High Priesthood of the Church. Sometime in March, 1832, Frederick G. Williams was designated by revelation (D&C 81:1) to be a counselor to Joseph Smith; but it was nearly a year thereafter, March 18, 1833, when a Council of the First Presidency was fully organized, Sidney Rigdon and Frederick G. Williams being set apart as Joseph's counselors. It will thus be seen that it was nearly three years from the organization of the Church before the highest Council was fully developed and completed (Widtsoe, John A., Priesthood and Church Government, pp. 258-259). The Prophet Joseph presided over the Church by virtue of his presidency over the High Priesthood of the Church and his ordination to that office. Each succeeding president has functioned by these same powers, assisted by counselors of his own choosing. Because the presidency has acted as a unit in its administrative functions, the counselors have not become known for their individual contributions to the Church. It is hoped that these lessons can point out some of the vital things they contributed to the welfare of the Church. A study of the contributions that these Church leaders have made to the Church should make us more appreciative of our religious heritage and cause us to prize our gospel teaching and its opportunities more than we commonly do. It is not the intention in these articles to give a complete biographical sketch of the life of each person studied. These can be found in convenient form elsewhere. Our intention is to stress their characters, their special talents and strengths in meeting the needs of their times, and the contributions that they made to Church growth and stability.

Lesson -1: Presidency of the Prophet Joseph Smith Elder T. Edgar Lyon For Tuesday, October 26, 1948 President Joseph Smith JOSEPH SMITH WHEN Joseph Smith was born at Sharon, Vermont, on December 23, 1805, a life had commenced that was ultimately to influence the course of millions of lives in all portions of the world. The family came from New England stock who had emigrated to America from England in 1638. Joseph Smith's parents were devout believers in the Savior and his atoning work as related in the New Testament. When, in the spring of 1820, an attempt was made by the three popular churches of the American frontier\u2014the Methodist, Presbyterian, and Baptist faiths\u2014to get the settlers in the vicinity where the Smiths resided interested in joining one of their churches, Joseph's mind was, as he expressed it, \"called up to serious reflection and great uneasiness.\" The zealous proponents of organized religion were insisting that religious truths could be gained from three sources: first, from the Bible; second, from the writing of the early Christian fathers and church councils; and third, by human reasoning, based on the Bible and a study of historic Christianity. Joseph Smith was not a trained religious scholar, nor was he acquainted with the history, documents, and traditions of the Christian world, hence these channels were not open to him. His approach to the problem of finding religious truth was characterized by a child-like faith. Just as great pioneers in science and education have cast traditional beliefs and practices aside and undertaken experimental research to discover truth, he subjected his religious perplexity to objective experimentation. He resorted to the method of God's anointed leaders in the early days of the Christian Church, namely, prayer and guidance through revelation. In his own words: In the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said to myself: What is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be right, which is it, and how shall I know it? While I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the contests of these parties of religionists, I was one day reading the Epistle of James, first chapter and fifth verse, which reads: If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did; for how to act I did not know, and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had, I would never know; for the teachers of religion of the different sects understood the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible. At length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in darkness and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of God. I at length came to the determination to \"ask of God,\" concluding that if he gave wisdom to them that lacked wisdom, and would give liberally, and not upbraid, I might venture (Pearl of Great Price, Joseph Smith 2:10-13). Unlike other religious founders, Joseph Smith was not a member of an already existing sect that he sought to reform. Neither did he lead a group of followers out of a church to form the nucleus of an apostate faction. Nor did he deliberately start out to found a new church, with preconceived notions about its theological teachings. He was commissioned, by the Father to bring to an apostate world the gospel of Jesus Christ, through the restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ in its original form.\n\nAs mentioned in the Preview, the Lord decreed that His kingdom on earth should be directed by a First Presidency. During the fourteen years that He presided over the Church, Joseph Smith had the assistance of counselors, four men at different times, serving in this capacity. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE\ufffdJULY 1948\n\nWith them he directed the various activities of the Church and its members. One of the tasks that occupied part of the time of the First Presidency was the regulation of the temporal affairs of the Church and the welfare of those who embraced its teachings. In the financial difficulties and in the persecutions in Ohio, Jackson, Clay, and Caldwell counties in Missouri, and Nauvoo, the First Presidency assisted Church members and sacrificed and suffered with them.\n\nAnother duty that rested upon the First Presidency was that of directing the missionary activities of the Church. They directed the establishment and operation of the School of the Prophets, which was designed primarily to better equip missionaries and Church leaders for their responsibilities. During the administration of Joseph Smith, missionary work was commenced in the eastern, southern, New England, and mid-western states of the Union; in Canada, Great Britain, and in some of the islands of the Pacific; and Palestine was dedicated for the gathering of the Jews and the ultimate opening of that land to the missionary work of the restored gospel.\n\nIn one great work, however, Joseph Smith stood quite apart from his counselors. It was imperative that further revelations be received if the Gospel in its fullness as restored to earth should be understood. Joseph Smith, as Prophet, Seer, and Revelator met this need as an instrument in the hands of God and throughout his life continued to build up the body of theological principles through the revelations he received. These he interpreted in terms of daily religious living. It is due to his efforts in this respect that the Gospel came to be a way of living, rather than a way of believing only.\n\nIn addition to the restoration and the interpretation of the true purposes and meanings of the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel, Joseph Smith gave to the world the true form, power, organization, and purpose of the Church as an instrument in the hands of God to accomplish His purposes on earth. He revealed the great doctrine of salvation for the dead, without which the benefits of the Atonement of Christ become limited to those who were members of His Church on earth and are not available to those who die without a knowledge of Christ and His Gospel. The keys of the priesthood were again restored to earth. The eternity of the marriage covenant, and the concept of eternal progression were glorious truths received as a heritage from the revelations to the first President of the Church.\n\nIn spite of the high position and the keys he held and the great devotion of his numerous followers, Joseph Smith remained essentially a common man among common men. In 1844, Josiah Quincy described him in Nauvoo as one dressed in the \"costume of a journeyman carpenter,\" but added: A fine-looking man, is what the passer-by would instinctively have murmured upon meeting the remarkable individual who had fashioned the mold which was to shape the feelings of so many thousands of his fellow mortals. But Smith was more than this, and one could not resist the impression that capacity and resource were natural to his stalwart person.\n\n497\n\nComparing Joseph Smith to another interesting acquaintance, Mr. Quincy continues: Of all men I have met these two seemed best endowed with that kingly faculty which directs, as by intrinsic right, the feeble or confused souls who are looking for guidance... Both were of commanding appearance, men whom it seemed natural to obey (Josiah Quincy, Figures of The Past, pp. 321, 233).\n\nHYRUM SMITH\n\nHyrum Smith No great man stands alone in his triumphs, and Joseph Smith had stalwart assistants upon whom he leaned for encouragement and support, and to whom he delegated part of the responsibility of the management of the growing Church. The one closest to him in this work was his brother Hyrum, who was his second counselor from November 7, 1837 until January 19, 1841, when he was sustained as Patriarch to the Church.\n\nThe literature of the world records some stories of great love that has existed between men. The Greeks had their account of Damon and Pythias; the Hebrews, the touching friendship of David and Jonathan; but in the love of Joseph and Hyrum for each other we have a love of brothers that stands out as a classic account of a love that was stronger than the fear of death. Joseph paid him this tribute: I could pray in my heart that all my brethren were like unto my beloved brother Hyrum, who possesses the mildness of a lamb, and the integrity of Job, and in short, the meekness and humility of Christ and I love him with that love that is stronger than death, for I never had occasion to rebuke him, nor he me.\n\nHyrum Smith was born February 9, 1800, at Tunbridge, Vermont, being nearly six years older than the Prophet. He was of a religious temperament, and although he had not affiliated himself with any church until he was twenty years of age, he had been reared with the New England religious concepts so that when the religious revival was instituted at Palmyra, New York, in the spring of 1820, he, his mother, a sister, and a brother joined the Presbyterian faith. This was in reality a return to the traditional family religion in New England.\n\nHowever, when his younger brother Joseph reported his vision, Hyrum became his staunch supporter and all through the trying times never varied from his loyal devotion to his brother. There is a powerful evidence of the sincerity of Joseph Smith in this fact that he could convince his own brother and others in the family of the reality of his revelations.\n\nHyrum was baptized in Seneca Lake in June 1829, and became a persistent advocate of the new religious principles. He it was who first met Parley P. Pratt and converted him to the restored Gospel. A study of Church history reveals many other converts whose first acquaintance with the latter-day work came through a contact with Hyrum.\n\nHyrum was one of the eight witnesses to the divine authenticity of the Book of Mormon. Parley P. Pratt tells how much his first conversation with Hyrum influenced him. He wrote: He also unfolded to me the particulars of the discovery of the Book; its translation; the rise of the Church of Latter-day Saints, and the commission of his brother Joseph, and others, by revelation and the ministering of angels, by which the apostleship and authority had been again restored to the earth. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE\ufffdJULY 1948\n\nAfter duly weighing the whole matter in my mind, I saw clearly that these things were true; and that myself and the whole world were without baptism, and without the ministry and ordinances of God; and that the whole world had been in this condition since the days that inspiration and revelation had ceased\u2014in short, that this was a new dispensation or commission, in fulfilment of prophecy, and for the restoration of Israel, and to prepare the way before the second coming of the Lord (Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt, p. 39). When the Prophet and others were arrested at Far West, Missouri, late in October 1838, and incarcerated during the winter of 1838-39 in Liberty and other Missouri jails, Hyrum was one of those apprehended. Although he had many opportunities to escape, he refused to desert his brother Joseph. When Joseph Smith went to Carthage late in June 1844, to answer to charges growing out of the destruction of the Nauvoo Expositor, Hyrum insisted on going with him. He remained with his beloved brother by his own choice. Hyrum was killed shortly before the Prophet.\n\nThe epitaph, \"In life they were not divided, and in death they were not separated!\" (D&C 135:3) is a fitting tribute to Hyrum as well as to Joseph Smith.\n\nEach and every O.

After the martyrdom, the Times and Seasons printed an editorial in which this was said of Hyrum: He lived so far beyond the ordinary walk of man that even the tongue of the vilest slanderer could not touch his reputation. He lived godly and he died godly. His greatest contribution to the Church is found in his stalwart support of his Prophet-brother. With him, he was so closely identified that it is almost impossible to discover wherein one acted apart from the other. In the midst of the Prophet's many trials and disappointments, often being deceived by those whom he trusted, God had given him one who stood firmly by him and from whom he gained strength.\n\nAt the time of Hyrum Smith's death, his son Joseph Fielding, born to his wife, Mary Fielding, was five years old. Joseph Fielding Smith later became the sixth president of the Church, presiding with great dignity and honor over the Church for which his father gave his life.\n\nTopics for Study and Discussion\n\n1.

This was a period of great growth in Nauvoo, and the Church was fostering many projects for the city's expansion. Toward the end of 1843 he began to show signs of apostacy and associated himself with the enemies of the Prophet and of the saints generally.\n\nThe result of this was his excommunication from the Church on April 18, 1844. He soon joined forces with other discontented factions and sponsored the publication of the much discussed Nauvoo Expositor, which contributed so much to the Prophet's assassination. He moved to Wisconsin, where he died on January 19, 1892, still bitter toward his former Prophet and the Latter-day Saints.\n\nTopics for Discussion and Study\n1.

I will only speak of the thing which stood out more than anything else. It was a clock without hands. I could hear the \"tick-tick\" of it as plainly as my own heart beat. Inspecting the works more closely, I found that the clock seemed to be in the best of condition, with one exception. Its face had the numbers of the hours, but no hands upon it. As I stood there thinking of the fitting except the clock seemed to be in the best of condition, with one exception. Its face had the numbers and that was the one thing for which the clock had been made. I waited and put the window.\nI was not thinking of clocks. I was thinking of people, whose lives are full of motion and activity, but the motion never amounts to anything. The activity never works out in definite achievement. They are like clocks without hands.\n\nAs I thought of the people whom I knew, in all walks of life, they started hours and began their activity, the very purpose for which they are in this world. You can hear the \"tick-tick\" of their lives. But you can never tell the time by them. Their lives are as empty of moral and spiritual meaning as the clock without hands. They are wound up; they are running; but they never indicate the time. The people who indicate time never keep time; they are a part of the waste material of the world.\n\nSUMMER SHINES WITH SILKEN SHOWERS\nHelen Martin Horne\n\nSummer shines with silken showers On mountains to the south.\nBlends odors from the freshening flowers When evening drops the sun.\nFrom pine-ribbed hills and canyon nooks A pungent smell she takes To scent the breeze that bends the trees, And sports the mountain lakes.\n\nThe summer lends to the fall Her colors brightly blended; But artful fall retints them all When summertime is ended.\n\nCINDERELLAS\nKatie Harris Lewis\n\nA weed in the moonlight Is lovely to see; And the generous moon Lends beauty to me.\n\nBISHOP HYDE\nMichael Burson\n\nIt was God's will I led you As it is now his will That calls me from his people For greater service still.\n\nI would be with you longer For I have loved you much, I'd fill our fields and flowers Beneath the sun's warm touch\n\nI would be here to counsel Wherever need might be, Yet I am but the servant And God the seed of me.\n\nBut falter not, my loved ones, Although I cannot stay To lead as I have led you\u2014 God points a better way.\n\nONE NAME ?

Harter of the Twenty-third Ward, Salt Lake Stake, has made a remarkable record in securing 112 Relief Society Magazine subscriptions in a ward having only thirty-seven members of the Society. Six subscriptions were sold to widowers, eight to non-members of the Church, and many were gifts for Christmas, birthdays, weddings, missionaries, shut-ins, and widows. Mrs. Harter has a sister Regine Nilsen, of Horten, Norway, whom she has never seen, but Mrs. Nilsen is a reader of The Relief Society Magazine. She saw Mrs. Harter's picture with a group of Magazine representatives (April 1947) and was delighted with this pleasant visit through the pages of the Magazine. Mrs. Harter wrote her sister: \"This Relief Society Magazine has made it possible for us to join hands across the sea, and even though we have not seen one another in person, we have the same warm, affectionate, sisterly love in our hearts which will bind us together always.\"\n\nEdith Russel, a young English writer, now living in Utah, is the author of \"The Russels Did Not Go to Church,\" a three part story beginning in this issue. Miss Russell says: \"When I was nine years old we moved to a tiny house in the village of Cottingley, close to the fringe of the Haworth moors and a mere five miles from the haunted shell of 'Wuthering Heights' itself. One year after my baptism into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I became a missionary and was honored by a call to become the only woman ever to edit Millennial Star. During these years, my country was at war, and London, our headquarters, proved a noisy, somewhat dangerous adventure. Then\u2014came an invitation to leave England for the U.S.A. To attend an American university, and I to whom school had always been the privilege of 'the other fellow,' thought I heard the angels sing!\"\n\nPage 576\n\nDeone R. Sutherland, author of \"Aunt Millenium,\" a daughter of the poet Linnie Fisher Robinson, is one of the most promising of Utah's young literary women. By editorial request Deone writes: \"I graduated from the University of Utah in 1945 after having edited the literary Magazine and participating in some drama. I continued teaching in the English department, freshman English, for two years. In the summer of 1947 I attended the University of Iowa and enjoyed the writer's workshop very much, but I returned in the fall to marry Harold Pratt Sutherland in the Salt Lake Temple. We have lived in Beaver for the past eight months and Harold has taught English in the high school. As to the future well, we're going to Stanford this summer.\"\n\nI wish to thank you for the promptness of the Magazine which reaches me way up here in Sweden. During the two years of my mission I have enjoyed it immensely. The Relief Society of Whittier Ward, Salt Lake City, gave me a two year's subscription as a present when I left. I have translated many features from the Magazine in Swedish and it has helped me in Relief Society work and missionary work in general. It might interest you to know that my husband finds the Magazine just as interesting.\n\nAmy Lundevall, Olaigatan, Orebro, Sweden\n\nSister Lillian Nielsen of Three Forks, Montana, has bought material and has recently made 64 pieces of clothing for children between six months and four years old. Because she lives on a farm, miles away from a branch of the Church, Sister Nielsen cannot attend meetings, but she can and does follow the work of Relief Society through reading the Magazine. She is the mother of a large family and yet she finds time to sew for others and to contribute many hours of unselfish service.\n\nTEACH THE LIFE OF CHRIST WITH PICTURES\n\nFour sets, comprising 63 four color 19\" x 23\" pictures\nSet One: (15 pictures) Nativity, Shepherds, Wise men, Babe in the Temple, Flight into Egypt, Boy Jesus in the Temple, Among the Doctors, Temptations, Miracles: Healing the Woman, Walks on the Water, Dumb Man Healed, Deaf Man Healed, Blind Man Healed, Draught of Fishes, Calms the Storm.\nSet Two: (16 pictures) Feeding Five Thousand, Heals the Lepers, Man at the Pool, Jairus' Daughter, Lazarus; Parables: Sower, Leaven, Wheat and Tares, Pounds and Talents, Ten Virgins, Prodigal Son, Good Samaritan, Pharisees, Fishermen, Disciples in Grain Field.\nSet Three: (16 pictures) Jesus Chooses Disciples, Clears the Temple, Children, (Hoffman), (Plockhorst), Consider the Lilies, Mary and Martha, Speaks from the Boat, Woman at the Well, Other Sheep, Nicodemus, Peter's Confession, Peace Be Unto This House, Rich Young Ruler, Come Unto Me, Twelve Sent Forth, Transfiguration.\nSet Four: (16 pictures) Entering Jerusalem, Last Supper, Gethsemane, Praying, Arrest of Jesus, Jesus and Peter, Jesus and Pilate, Pilate Washes His Hands, Before Caiaphas, Guards Cast Lots, He Is Risen, On Way to Emmaus, At Emmaus, Appears to Apostles, Great Commission, The Ascension.\n\nEach Set $2.00\n\nDESERET BOOK COMPANY\n44 East South Temple Street, Salt Lake City 10, Utah\n\nPlease send me LIFE OF CHRIST picture sets as follows: At $2.00 each.\nOe Address......Mention The Relief Society Magazine When Buying From Advertisers\n\nU.S. POSTAGE 2 \nPaid SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH PERMIT No. 690\n\nSYMBUL OF THRIFT\nAmong priceless heritages left by our pioneer mothers is the custom of providing a bounteous supply of fruits for the long winter months.

Driggs\nFor Tuesday, December 21, 1948\nMAIN emphasis is given in the Book of Mormon to the \"things of God.\" As a result, in every book of this scripture will be found awe-coined, principles of the gospel impressively and plainly stated, and prophetic literature of soul-stirring quality. All of these spiritual expressions are in accord with the Bible, whose divine lessons of life are amplified and clarified by this other \"Book of Books.\"\nOur readers may recall that in the study of the Bible from the literary viewpoint, we dealt with what Dr. Moulton calls Wisdom Literature. The book of \"Proverbs\" is made up of such literature\u2014sayings of practical worth and uplift, pointing the way of righteousness. In the Book of Mormon, there is no such book. Bringing together the bits of wisdom, but similar gems of distinctive literary quality are to be found in many of the chapters of the book. Following are examples of these treasures of wisdom:\nYes, it is the love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men; wherefore, it is the most desirable above all things (1 Nephi 11:22).\nThe guilty taketh the truth to be hard; for it cutteth them to the very center (1 Nephi 16:2).\nAdam fell that men might be; and men are that they might have joy (2 Nephi 2:25).\nSee that ye have faith, hope and charity, and then ye will always abound in good works (Alma 7:24).\nThis is my glory, that perhaps I may be an instrument in the hands of God to bring some soul to repentance; and is my joy (Alma 29:9).\nDo ye suppose that ye cannot worship God save it be in your synagogues only?\u2014do ye suppose that ye must not worship God only once in a week? (Alma 32:10).\nBlessed are they who humble themselves without being compelled to be humble (Alma 32:16).\nFools mock, but they shall mourn; and my grace is sufficient for the meek (Ether 12:26).\nFor the eternal purposes of the Lord shall go on, until all his promises shall be fulfilled (Mormon 5:22).\nI love little children with a perfect love, and they are all alike and partakers of salvation (Moroni 8:17).\nWe have a labor to perform whilst in this tabernacle of clay, that we may conquer the enemy of all righteousness (Mormon 9:6).\nMany, as they read these gems of spiritual thought, will recall others they have found in the Book of Mormon. A search for such treasures will bring true riches. What may be found of appeal to each one who seeks, will be more deeply impressed if the choice saying is written and kept in a little book of reference. This practice is commended.\nVitality will also be given to this search for precious lines if the gems are studied in their settings. For example, after the soul-testings\nTHAT'S WHAT YOU GET IN A \"FONTS\" AMONG FONS   A FIND ANY COLOR YOU WANT TO MATCH ANY COLOR IN DRAPERIES, WALLPAPER ANYTHING.

BEHOLD, I SAY UNTO YOU, WICKEDNESS NEVER WAS HAPPINESS\" (Alma 41:10). SOME OF THESE PROFOUND LINES OF WISDOM SPRAWNED THROUGH THE PAGES OF THE BOOK OF MORMON, LAY EMPHASIS ON CERTAIN BASIC THEMES.

Whatsoever is good cometh from God, and whatsoever is evil cometh from the devil (Alma 5:40). In the moving story that Alma the younger tells to his son Helaman, of his being redeemed from sin and turned to the joy of active goodness, we have an effective example of stirring literature. Writes Alma: And now, for three days and for three nights was I racked, even with the pains of a damned soul. And.... While I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world. Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death.... When I thought this, I could remember my pains no more.... Yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!: Yea, and from that time... I have labored without ceasing, that I might bring souls unto repentance; that I might bring them to taste of the exceeding joy of which I did taste; that they might also be born of God, and be filled with the Holy Ghost (Alma 36:16 ff.). 643 Joseph Wm.

Added to this there are many places where the prophets of long ago days on our American continent made plain the divine principles of the gospel. As a striking example take the masterful interpretation of the resurrection and the restoration by the prophet Alma, as recorded in chapters 40 and 41 of the book of Alma, or from the same book in chapter 42, the exposition of justice and mercy. This represents really great religious literature. It is worth reading and re-reading; indeed one must read it often grow up with it, to grasp its deep import. A few concluding paragraphs from these splendid chapters will serve here to illustrate the profound thought, the high literary quality of the whole portrayal of divine truth: But God ceaseth not to be God, and mercy claimeth the penitent, and mercy cometh because of the atonement; and the atonement bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead; and the resurrection of the dead bringeth back men into the presence of God; and thus they are restored into his presence, to be judged according to their works, according to the law and justice. For behold, justice exerciseth all his demands, and also mercy claimeth all which is her own; and thus none but the truly penitent are saved... Therefore, O my son, whosoever will come may come and partake of the waters of life freely; and whosoever will not come the same is not compelled to come; but in the last day it shall be restored unto him according to his deeds. If he has desired to do evil, and has not repented in his days, behold, evil shall be done unto him, according to the restoration of God. Only a few hints of the richness of the gospel messages, with some suggestions of their distinctive literary quality, their sincerity and clarity in revealing saving truths could be given in this brief lesson. Brought forth with divine help by the Prophet of these latter days, The Book of Mormon contains a wealth of reference: Book of Mormon. Each member of the class should provide her/himself 1. What is one essential difference between the Presentation of Wisdom Literature, as represented by \"Proverbs\" and such literature in the Book of Mormon? B. In what respect is there a similarity? Give, for example, one of the proverbs and some like gem from college example of an exposition of basic pos pel principles found in the Book of Mormon. Fall Term Starts Sept. 9-13 a. II Nephi 26:23 to end of chapter; \"b. Mosiah 4:21 to end of chapter; c. Alma 18:10-35; Helaman 13:1-3 Write the Registrar at Rexburg, Idaho, for a Catalogue 646 Title 2.

Inter Term Starts Dec. 6 Spring Term Starts March 7 Summer Term Starts June 6 LESSON DEPARTMENT and continue with 30 to end of chapter; e. II Nephi 1:1-17-3.\n\nCaution: In making any of the foregoing studies keep attention not alone on the doctrine but also upon the effective expression of the principles of life and salvation so well portrayed. The Book of Mormon while in consonance with the Old and the New Testament in the presentation of gospel truth has a distinctive style or way of presenting old truths. This is but natural, because of the different authors who have made the record and it adds to the charm of this \"Book of Books.\" One good way to enhance the appreciation of this \"New Witness for Christ\" is to have some of its fine passages voiced or read aloud expressively.\n\n> SOCIAL SCIENCE\nNo lessons are planned for December in the Social Science and Optional departments, due to the holiday season.\n\nET SPRING GARDENS START WITH FALL PLANTING\nWrite today for our free Autumn Catalog illustrated in full color.\nTULIPS DAFFODILS HYACINTHS AND LILIES\nPERENNIALS \"TREES AND SHRUBS\"\nSeptember is Lawn Planting Month\n\nPORTER-WALTON CO.

Rosa Lee began her writing career at the age of seven and even now she has to be careful or her imagination will run away with her. She has won two national story prizes and has sold numerous stories and poems to United States and Canadian national magazines. She was editor of the Year Book at Davis County High School, a member of the Utonian staff at the University of Utah, and she is a past president of the Art Barn board of directors, past president of the Barnacles (story-writing group) and is now the president of the Salt Lake Chapter, League of Utah writers. Mrs. Lloyd and her husband Llewellyn lost their gifted and promising son Tyndale in the recent war.\n\nI should like to take this opportunity to mention the enjoyment I have gained from reading the fine material presented in the Relief Society Magazine. \"The Visitors\" by Fay Tarlock (March 1948) and \"'Pankapaw\" by Deone R. Sutherland (March 1948) held a particular appeal to me.\nIris W.

I am humbly happy that my first story is to appear in the publication of my own beloved Relief Society. During my mission to the Eastern States (1935-37) I served for a time as mission Relief Society secretary under Sister Don B. Colton. I am the mother of five children, four sons and one daughter. The oldest is eight and the youngest is one. I shall be happy when I can be regularly engaged in Church work, but I hope to have more children girls!\n\nRe KR\nI have received letters from people as widely separated as California and New Jersey referring to my recent article (\"For Makers of Rhythmic Beauty,\" June 1948). One lady in the East wanted to start to work immediately on a course of work under me, but I had to tell her I was not teaching a correspondence course in the subject at this time.\nYou are putting out a very attractive and helpful Magazine.

Kimball\nThe man whom Brigham Young chose to be his first counselor in the Presidency of the Church in 1847 was one of his closest personal friends. He was well suited to the task and Brigham's close acquaintance with him had revealed the characteristics that were needed to help him carry the tremendous load that he would have as President of the Church. Heber C. Kimball was born in Vermont, on June 14, 1801\u2014just thirteen days after the birth of Brigham Young. He likewise had established himself in Mendon, New York, but he had learned the trade of a potter as well as farming, and in 1830 at the time of a \"revival,\" had joined the Baptist church. About three weeks after his baptism he heard of the restoration of the gospel and he and Brigham and Phineas Young and their wives journeyed to Pennsylvania where they visited with members of the Church. In April 1832, he was baptized and in September of that year he and Brigham and Joseph Young visited Kirtland and met the Prophet Joseph for the first time. They soon moved to Kirtland, and from that time until the death of the Prophet, Elder Kimball was closely associated with him, being one of the original group of Twelve Apostles.\n\nRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE\u2014OCTOBER 1948\nNSTR ERIEPISSIISDIAEVDIM\nTwo Part SACRED CHORUSES for your SINGING MOTHERS' Repertoire\n7947 Sing O Heavens\u2014Simper...$12.18\n1875 Father, In Thy Mysterious Presence Kneeling \u2014 Protheroe 12.52\n43 Thy House Forever \u2014 Protheroe (12.79)\n5243 Lift Up Your Heads\u2014Hopkins.12\n5972 Come, We That Love The Lord\u2014Barnes 10\n5062 The Good Shepherd\u2014Barri.....12\nW1718 Grateful, O Lord, Am I\u2014 Roma 15\n2119 Beside Still Waters \u2014 Hamblen 15\n1762 Father, We Thank Thee \u2014 Castleton 5237\nFor He Shall Give His Angels Charge\u2014Protheroe ___.............10\nWrite for further information concerning our complete stock of choral music both for women's and for mixed voices.

In Nauvoo he became an enthusiastic worker for the development of the saints' city, and after the death of the Prophet was a loyal supporter of President Brigham Young. When the Presidency was reorganized on December 5, 1847, President Young assigned to him the first place in the counselorship, and for the remaining twenty-one years of his life, he stood by his best friend as he had previously supported his Prophet.\n\nIn the pioneering of the Great Basin, Elder Kimball was one of the planners and stimulators. With Brigham Young he visited the colonies that had been established in the various portions of the then expansive Utah Territory, and spoke prophetic encouragement to the struggling saints. He was also a member of the territorial legislature for many years. His particular gifts in speaking appear to have been his ability to speak the language of the common man and to explain doctrines and make them impressive through the use of homely stories and apt sayings which were long remembered and afterward quoted by the saints as gospel truths. He was also possessed of a fine sense of discernment. Particularly did this spiritual gift manifest itself in predictions.\n\n717 DON'T DELAY\nEvery day you postpone changing to the O. P.

As a result of a severe fall sustained in Provo, Utah, he died at Salt Lake City on June 22, 1868. Brigham Young lost in him a wise counselor and the saints an approachable leader who lived close to them. God had taken one of the most humble of this world to confound the mighty, the wise, and the strong.\n\nTopics for Discussion and Study\n\n1.

Madsen Member, General Board of Relief Society\nWords are freeborn.... They have the same right to dance and sing as the dewdrops have to sparkle and shine\u2014Abraham Coles.\n\nN song the words are just as important as the music. They represent the thoughts, feelings, and emotions that are to be conveyed. It is essential, therefore, that they are fully understood by the listener. However, the words are not to be overspoken to the sacrifice of the tone quality, nor should they be spoken in the small speech form of ordinary conversation. The singer, like the dramatic reader, must use the large speech form which means the full use of all the resonating cavities of the head and face.\n\nThis further implies that the mouth is well opened, the lower jaw thoroughly relaxed, the tip of the tongue touching the lower front teeth for all vowels. In the meantime all the resonating cavities such as the hard palate, the sinuses, the nose, the face-mask, etc., should be unobstructed so that they can function fully as amplifiers of the tone.\n\nTo obtain the most satisfactory word-resonance the hum tone must be cultivated. The singing-hum is properly produced by observing the following:\n\n(a) Yawn position of mouth\n(b) Closed lips\n(c) Teeth well apart\n(d) Tongue relaxed, teeth (e) Lower jaw free and unprotruded touching front\n\nThis hum is to be practiced with \"M\" in three different ways:\n1. Sustained on various pitches in the medium part of the voice\n2. Partial scales and arpeggios (chordlines) then in their entirety\n3. Well-known song melodies, such as \"Sweet Hour of Prayer,\" \"Abide With Me,\" \"Love's Old Sweet Song\" (chorus), etc.\n\nDuring all humming and word singing the following vocal positions should be adhered to:\n\n(a) Erect standing or sitting\n(b) High and expanded chest and ribs\n(c) Contracted abdominal muscles\n\nWith practice these positions can be maintained without the least semblance of rigidity. This is accomplished when all of the released energy used in singing is balanced and equally distributed and when all of the muscles concerned remain elastic and easily subject to the dictates of the will.\n\nSinging, as well as being an aesthetical expression, is very definitely a physical exercise, and all normal physical exercises are possible only through equalized and correlated energy.\n\n[Note: The short articles on music which appear in the Magazine may form the basis for the discussion in the choristers' and organists' department at union meeting.]\n\nPage 719\n\nFrom fear and Sar\nMaryhale Woolsey, author of \"Curtain Call,\" was born in Spanish Fork and has lived in Utah most of her life. As a young person, she was indignant that no one had ever written a song about our western mountains\u2014so she did something about it and the ever-popular \"Springtime in the Rockies\" was the result. She writes stories, poems, plays, and songs. Her work has been published in the Church magazines and Eastern and Canadian magazine. She is a member of the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP), League of Utah Writers, Art Barn Poets, and National Writers Club.\n\nMrs. Woolsey has four daughters who are also talented in writing and art. She attended the B. Y. U. In Provo, Utah.\n\nI am truly grateful for all the many years of fine reading I have enjoyed through the Magazine.\n\u2014Mrs. Wanda E. Stewart, South Gate, California\n\nIt is nearly 100 miles to the nearest Church from our home and my only connections are through the monthly Magazines and I enjoy them very much and look forward to receiving them. Thank you very much for the wonderful Magazine and may God bless and keep you.\nMrs. Lilly Bennett, Menasha, Wisconsin.\n\nJust now I sent in another group of Magazine subscriptions for our small branch. I picked up my expiring copy and again read the inspiring poetry therein. Such a beautiful book you are giving us. Money couldn't buy mine back. The contents are complete, especially for a homebody like myself, but the poetry is the best anywhere. It is the first thing I read.\n\u2014Darliene Thompson, Tulsa, Oklahoma\n\nPage 720\n\nYour executive officers very kindly placed me on the complimentary list for The Relief Society Magazine. I should like to become a paying subscriber if this is possible, as the articles on the old pioneering days and old customs are interesting.... During the war the Rector one day had two young American ladies in uniform who paid us a visit from London and asked to be shown over the church. During the visit one stated that her grandmother had been in service as a housemaid in the rectory over ninety years ago and her mother wanted a photograph of the old rectory, which was duly done. It is things like these which link our two nations together, also our two churches, although many miles apart.\n\u2014F. Z. Claro, Sidesman, St. Mary's Church, Corringham, Essex, England.\n\nI am taking this liberty to send in my appreciation for your splendid Magazine, although I am not a member of the organization, being a man, but I have been treading the Magazine for almost half a century, and I must say some of the finest contributions include the short stories.\n\n\nI used to wonder why we didn't have more writers of stories, real life stories, written by our own people. Now that wish has been realized during recent years for some of the very best stories are found in The Relief Society Magazine.\n\nF. M. Shafer, Moab, Utah\n\nOne of the most interesting pages in the Magazine to me is the reprint page from \"Sixty Years Ago.\" It seems to link my contribution to Relief Society, small as it is, with all those who have gone before. I feel the magnitude and timelessness of this work.\n\nWasn't it fun to read the fashion notes in the last issue on that page (September 1948)?

Clark, Houston, Texas. She is the mother of three sons and president of the Houston Branch Relief Society. She began writing while attending Brigham Young University. Her literary work is distinguished by clarity and beauty of language and a deep insight into character and personality. Many of our readers will recall with pleasure her delightful pioneer poem \"To My Mother\" which was awarded first honorable mention in the Eliza R. Snow Poem Contest in 1936.\nMrs. Clark and her husband have been active leaders in several wards and branches of the Church \u2014 including Mesa (Arizona), Albuquerque (New Mexico), and El Paso (Texas), where they have welcomed many missionaries and converts to the Church.\n\nI appreciate having The Relief Society Magazine for a year so that I might know more about the Mormon faith and its many fine works.\nMildred Chatfield Smith, Watertown, Mass.\n\nI enjoy my work in contacting the women (as Magazine representative) and find that the Magazine sells itself. Also I enjoy it for it fills all my needs.\nEmma J. Lines, Duncan, Arizona.\n\nEnclosed find check for the coming year's subscription to the Magazine. We can't do without it in our home.\nI want to express my sincere thanks to Carol Read Flake for her excellent story \"Sudden Storm\" in the September issue. May she write more stories of this high caliber.\nSuccess to you and all your helpers on this our own ladies' Magazine.\nFrances Yost, Bancroft, Idaho.\n\nI find The Relief Society Magazine a great help and inspiration in my missionary work and I want it for myself even though I am a man. I heartily recommend it to all missionaries.\nElder Frank Harold Wing, Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nPage 792\nYou may be interested to know that I visited several of the families that I have been sending the Magazine to. They are all non-members, and each one praised the Magazine very highly, saying they passed it on to friends and relatives when they had finished reading it. It was the means of a good many interesting gospel conversations.\nUna McDonald, Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\n\"The Visitors\" by Fay Tarlock (March 1948) is a fascinating story. It reveals unusual ability to portray human behavior patterns truthfully and entertainingly. To my delight I find no flaws in her portrayals, no confusion of traits, not one tiny slip out of character, and I knew intimately the two dear women she describes so charmingly.\nI predict for Mrs. Tarlock a brilliant career in the realm of homey stories.\nEstelle Neff Caldwell, Los Angeles, California.\n\nThe sisters here in Glasgow (Scotland) appreciate the Relief Society Magazine and send their best wishes for its continued success.\nEllen Martin.\n\nThe current feature in the Relief Society Magazine, \"The Russells Did Not Go to Church,\" (August, September, and October) is unusually good.\nFay Tarlock, Danville, California.\n\nI love our Magazine and would not think of being without it. You are doing a grand work.\nIrene K. Read, Boise, Idaho.\n\nI am eighty years old and I have always enjoyed The Relief Society Magazine. Success for the Magazine.\nMarietta S. Porter, Myton, Utah.\n\nWe did so much enjoy the fine story in the September issue of The Relief Society Magazine, \"Learn of Love\" by Rosa Lee Lloyd.\nElsie Jack, Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nVisited Several of the families that I have been sending the Magazine to, They are they had finished reading it.

P SKAGGS be service; FOOD \"STORES was attempting to destroy the Church, his vision of the destiny of the Latter-day Saint Church was not dimmed.\n\nIn addition to conducting the affairs of the Church at headquarters, he planned and directed the openings of the Mexican and Maori (New Zealand) missions; inaugurated the Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, and Upper Snake River Valley colonizations of the saints; planned the colonization of saints in Mexico and sent missionaries to labor among the Indians in Idaho, Wyoming, New Mexico, and Arizona.\n\nIt was during President Taylor's administration that the golden jubilee of the Church was celebrated, and in spite, of the persecution that was directed against the saints it was made a time of rejoicing.\n\nDebts due the Perpetual Emigration Fund by poor saints were cancelled, as were overdue tithes; cattle, and sheep were distributed to the poor and the needy; and the Relief Society was called upon to assist in the good work for the benefit of the Church as a whole. The preceding year had been one of great drought and there was a scarcity of seed-wheat for the new crop. President Taylor suggested that the Relief Society sisters lend their 34,761 bushels of stored wheat\u2014 they had been accumulating it for years against a time of need\u2014to the farmers, to be repaid without interest after the harvest. 'This was gladly done and proved to be of great benefit to all of the settlements.\n\nPresident Taylor was a man of culture and refinement. He wrote as a gifted theologian and a profoundly religious philosopher. His literary writings, as well as his sermons, manifest a beautiful style. As recreation he wrote religious poetry and drama. His best known poems which have been set to music are the missionary hymn, \"Go Ye Messengers of Glory,\" \"The Glorious Plan,\" and \"The Seer,\" in which latter he poured out his heart concerning his departed Prophet-leader.\n\nDue to the crusade that was being waged against the Church, President Taylor was faced with the alternative of submitting to a prison sentence or retiring from the public eye. He chose the latter course and made no public appearance after February 1884. From his post in exile he directed the affairs of the Church to the best of his ability. The enforced separation from his family and his inability to get the exercise to which he was accustomed, undoubtedly shortened his life. He died in exile at Kaysville, Utah, on July 25, 1887.\n\nGod had guided this leader from his native England to the New World where the restored gospel awaited him, and then given him inspiration to guide the destinies of the kingdom. Of God on earth was George O. Cannon\n\nGeorge Q. Cannon, whom President Taylor chose to be his first counselor in 1880, was born in Liverpool, England in 1827, and was baptized by Elder Taylor in June 1840. Emigrating with his parents to Nauvoo in 1842, he went to live at the home of his uncle, Elder John Taylor, and until 1849 was considered a part of the Taylor household. At Nauvoo he learned the printing and publishing business under the tutelage of his uncle, and this skill proved of great worth to himself and the Church in later years.\n\nHe emigrated to Utah in 1847. \"Bibles Since 1863 at Your Bookstore\" \"Better Living\" Buy From YOUR DEALER Utah Power & Light Company\n\nSears Parking Right Handy You are just a step or two from your car when you shop at Sears.

He remained there until 1854 and during these four years was primarily instrumental in the conversion of about four thousand natives to the Church. He acquired great proficiency in the use of the Hawaiian language and translated The Book of Mormon into that tongue, and later at San Francisco, published this work.\n\nHe was ordained an apostle August 26, 1860, and left soon afterward for New York where he acted as immigration agent for the Church. In 1861 he established the first Church owned printing shop in England, and for many years this establishment was the chief publishing center for Church literature. While in charge of the British Mission between 1862 and 1864, he directed the emigration of upwards of 13,000 saints to America in especially chartered vessels. Charles Dickens visited one of these vessels before it sailed, to make a report on emigration, and saw President Cannon supervising and organizing the group for the voyage. He paid President Cannon and the Mormon emigrants some fine compliments in his article in Uncommercial Traveler.\n\nPresident Cannon established the Juvenile Instructor (now The Instructor) in 1866, as a means of teaching the gospel to the youth of Zion. He devoted many years to the organization of the Sunday Schools in the Church and was a member of the Sunday School Union from its organization in 1867 until his death in 1901. A man of great speaking and reasoning ability, he was elected as territorial delegate to Congress for ten years and held numerous positions within the territorial government of Utah.\n\nTo President Cannon the Church is greatly indebted for the publishing of much of its literature. He encouraged many of the early converts to the Church and more recent ones to write their religious experiences for the benefit of the young people. These were subsequently published in the Juvenile Instructor and as pamphlets or booklets. As first counselor to John Taylor, he shared with his President the hardships of the persecutions of the 1880's and stood by him as a valiant assistant in managing the affairs of the Church.\n\nJoseph F. Smith The second counselor of President John Taylor, Joseph F. Smith, was a son of Hyrum Smith, brother of the Prophet, and was born at Far West, Missouri, on November 13, 1838. He had spent a life of service for the Church at the time the call to the Presidency came in 1880. He had gone on his first mission at the age of fifteen to the Hawaiians and had been ordained an apostle in 1866.\n\nA further account of his life and labors will appear in the following lesson and the one dealing with him as President of the Church.\n\nTopics for Discussion\n\n1.
