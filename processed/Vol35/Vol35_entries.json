    "content": "Pioneer Women\nPresident David O. McKay\nOf the First Presidency (Delivered at the afternoon session of the Annual Relief Society General Conference held in the Tabernacle, Thursday, October 2, 1947.)\n\nSISTERS, Visiting Brethren,\nthe sweet perfume that radiates from these lovely leis, graciously presented by the President of the Oahu Stake in Hawaii, but typifies the sweet spirit of spirituality that radiates from this large audience of Relief Society workers.\n\nWhen I think of the ideals you represent, as offered in the Relief Societies of the Church—self-improvement, perpetuation and beautification of home, preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ, service, not only to those in distress but to everyone who needs your tender care—I do not hesitate to say that this is one of the most significant gatherings, if not the most significant assembly of women in the world. I am glad to be with you. It is an inspiration to partake of your spirit.\n\nWe have listened to inspirational addresses from your fellow workers, representatives of the General Board, this inspirational singing from our Singing Mothers.\nThe ideals represented here cannot help but make everyone present feel that it is good to be here.\n\nI know from the papers and from your program that you have had definite instruction regarding your work meeting and your literary lessons, your religious themes, social service, and all the other features of Relief Society work. Indeed, if I would I could not instruct you on these details, as I am not sufficiently informed.\nI have, therefore, directed my attention along the lines suggested by Sister Spafford and her associates on the part that women have played in the Centennial, and my thoughts have not centered so much on what women have done throughout the counties (although their labors are inestimable and to them we owe the success, largely, of these great county celebrations that have been carried on during this Centennial Year), as upon the pioneer women who contributed so much and endured so much during those trying days of Nauvoo and during the trek to Salt Lake Valley.\n\nIn paying tribute to them we shall pay tribute to all womankind, especially to women in the Church, for they are just as loyal today as they were then.\nAs the Utah Centennial celebration draws to a close, it seems appropriate to pause a moment to pay tribute to these pioneer women. And well do they merit infinitely more than our feeble efforts can give them.\nTheir fitting praise requires the best that fluent tongues and gifted pens can express.\n\nYou will find few if any of their names inscribed on monuments erected to the brave. Some are not even known beyond their family circles; not a few lie in unmarked graves out on the plains, but the burdens they bore uncomplainingly,\nPIONEER WOMEN\nthe contributions they made to the settlement of the arid West, the virtues they exemplified in the midst of trials and almost super-human endurance entitle them to an honored place among the heroines of the world.\n\nWe confess that during this Centennial we have not laid much emphasis upon the part that women played in the settlement of this Western Empire. In this we are but following the general practice of men throughout the ages.\nWomen bear the burdens of the household, carry most of the responsibility of rearing a family, inspire their husbands and sons to achieve success; and while the latter are being given the applause of public acclaim, the wives and mothers who really merit recognition and commendation remain smilingly content in unheralded achievement.\n\nIn the words of Jack Appleton:\n\"A man succeeds and reaps the honors of public applause when in truth a quiet little woman has made it all possible—has by her tact and encouragement held him to his best, has had faith in him when his own faith has languished, has cheered him with the unfailing assurance: 'You can, you must, you will.'\"\n\nBroken by Fate, unrelenting,\nScarred by the lashings of Chance;\nBitter his heart—unrepenting—\nHardened by Circumstance;\nShadowed by Failure ever,\nCursing, he would have died,\nBut the touch of her hand, her strong warm hand,\nAnd her love of his soul, took full command,\nJust at the turn of the tide!\nStanding beside him, filled with trust,\n\"Win,\" she whispered, \"you must, you must!\"\nHelping, and loving and guiding,\nUrging when that were best,\nHolding her fears in hiding,\nDeep in her quiet breast;\nThis is the woman who kept him\nTrue to his standards high,\nWatching, and guarding, whispering still,\n\"Win, you can, you must, you will!\"\n\nThis is the story of the ages,\nThis is Woman's way;\nWiser than seers or sages,\nLifting us day by day;\nFacing all things with courage\nNothing can daunt or dim,\nTreading Life's path, wherever it leads—\nLined with flowers or choked with weeds,\nBut ever with him—with him!\n\nGuidon—comrade—golden spur—\nThe men who win are helped by her!\n\nThey admire beautiful things. They like to dress becomingly. 'They admire china and silverware. 'They enjoy decorating their rooms and making homes livable and attractive. They appreciate an occasional gift of jewelry, of a piece of Royal Doulton or of Dresden. The pioneer woman and her associates who entered Salt Lake Valley one hundred years ago enjoyed none of these luxuries. They had to be content, and were content with the mere necessities. With these inherent tendencies of womankind in mind, let me invite you, with the facts of history before us, to recross the plains with two or three of these heroines. 'Those to whom we refer this afternoon are but representatives of thousands to whom tribute is due. One of the most tragically heroic epochs in Church history, one in which are exemplified the dauntless faith and divine leadership of the men at the head of the Church, and the super-human, sublime patience, and resourcefulness of the women, is the period following the expulsion of the saints from Nauvoo, and the building of Winter Quarters on the banks of the Missouri. Most of our attention this year has been directed to the trek from Winter Quarters to Salt Lake Valley, but I think the greatest heroism of the Church, manifestations of the greatest leadership, and loyalty to Church and to ideals of the women, occurred between the months of February and September of 1846. The story of that trek has never yet been fully told. It is difficult for us who attempt to pay a feeble tribute to these pioneers one hundred years later, even to imagine, for example, what those shelterless mothers endured during the month of February 1846—note the month—as they passed through the throes of confinement on the banks of the Sugar Creek when nine babies were born. You mothers can understand this better than we men. The world will do well to pause and think what it was that inspired the women to endure uncomplainingly such trials. Picturing the scene, Eliza R. Snow writes: \"We had been preceded from Nauvoo by thousands, and I was informed that on the first night of the encampment, nine children were born into the world, and from that time, as we journeyed onward, mothers gave birth to offspring under almost every variety of circumstances imaginable, except those to which they had been accustomed; some in tents, others in wagons—in rainstorms and in snowstorms. I heard of one birth which occurred under the rude shelter of a hut, the sides of which were formed of blankets fastened to poles stuck in the ground, with a bark roof through which the rain was dripping. Kind sisters stood holding dishes to catch the water as it fell, thus protecting the newcomer and its mother from a showerbath as the little innocent first entered on the stage of human life; and through faith in the Great Ruler of events, no harm resulted to either.\" In that month, women, driven from their comfortable homes in Nauvoo, left their land, which many of them could not sell, abandoned household furniture, treasured pictures and accumulated relics, left the old clock ticking a gloomy farewell, taking nothing with which they could do without, crossed the Mississippi River to begin a trackless journey, and to endure the hardships incident to camping in the open it on muddy ground, under inclement, often stormy skies, with inadequate provisions and clothing. Picture this afternoon, if you can—and this is a real incident—a young mother with the care and responsibility of three children—a girl of seven, a boy of five, and a baby boy one and one-half years old, subjected to these adverse conditions. On her and her little children, on February  PIONEER WOMEN 25, three inches of snow fell. Only tents and wagon boxes for shelter. The diaries of that day tell us that this mother and babies, as many others, had to sleep out of doors as the wagon boxes were loaded with food and with what few household necessities the refugees could take along. Time will not permit me to pause longer on that journey across Iowa. They reached Mount Pisgah in due time, stayed there until fall, then joined the saints at Winter Quarters and prepared to cross the plains next year. Now I am going to ask you to consider conditions ten years later. Thousands of women by that time had walked across the plains, your grandmothers and mine among them, and many of them prompted to do that out of consideration for widows who could not come any other way, so they shared the wagon and let the widow ride while they walked. \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\" But ten years later they had instituted, or inaugurated the handcart method of crossing the plains. Today, that just seems to me—I do not know—almost incomprehensible, but they fitted out their handcarts at Winter Quarters, loaded each with such household goods and such food as they could, took the cattle and drove them along, and marched across the plains singing that inspiring song with which you opened this gathering, \"Come, Come, Ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear, but with joy wend your way.\" Wives pulling and pushing handcarts, aiding their husbands, while little children trudged at their sides! But in that year of 1856 two companies were delayed. They were advised not to attempt the trip. It was too late. One man who had crossed called them together and said: \"You had better wait.\" But the majority voted to attempt it, and he said: \"All right, if you are determined to go I will go with you and help you; if necessary, die with you.\" \"Greater love, hath no man, than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\" The next morning a young wife and mother stood by the side of a newly dug grave, the final resting place of her husband and fourteen others who had taken the last step on life's journey. One of those put in that grave had helped to dig it the night before. One of the mother's arms caressed a little boy sorrowfully sobbing as he buried his face in the folds of his mother's dress. You and I cannot even imagine the aching sorrow and poignant grief that must have filled that young woman's heart as she and her little son pulled their handcart that day without husband and daddy. Later, in the month of September, at the close of the day's march, a bride of twelve months gave birth to a baby girl. The records do not say whether the company halted for the mother to recuperate. If they did, it would be only for a day or two, and the young mother would have to trudge along carrying in her arms, or placing it on the handcart, her newborn babe. What a picture for an artist! What an appeal to the skeptical, indifferent world today! What an illustration of heroism and faith!\n\nIllustrative of this last thought, I am going to tell you what that father said about it, years afterward, for the father, mother, and baby came to Utah, and it was my privilege to sit at the table of that little baby girl when she was grown, and hear the story from her own lips. She was living in a comfortable home with nine lovely children around her. In that same town, years later, a teacher, conducting a class, said it was unwise ever to attempt, even to permit them to come across the plains under such conditions. \"Some sharp criticism of the Church and its leaders was being indulged in for permitting any company of converts to venture across the plains with no more supplies or protection than a handcart caravan afforded.\" An old man in the corner\"�and this was written by President William Palmer, who was present\"�\"sat silent and listened as long as he could stand it, then he arose and said things that no person who heard him will ever forget. His face was white with emotion, yet he spoke calmly, deliberately, but with great earnestness and sincerity.\n\n\"In substance the father above mentioned said, 'I ask you to stop this criticism. You are discussing a matter you know nothing about. Cold historic facts mean nothing here, for they give no proper interpretation of the questions involved. Mistake to send the Handcart Company out so late in the season? Yes. But I was in that company and my wife was in it and Sister Nellie Unthank whom you have cited was there, too. We suffered beyond anything you can imagine,\" \"and many died of exposure and starvation, but did you ever hear a survivor of that company utter a word of criticism? Not one of that company ever apostatized or left the Church, because everyone of us came through with the absolute knowledge that God lives for we became acquainted with him in our extremities.\"\n\n\"I have pulled my handcart when I was so weak and weary from illness and lack of food that I could hardly put one foot ahead of the other. I have looked ahead and seen a patch of sand or a hill slope and I have said, 'I can go only that far and there I must give up, for I cannot pull the load through it.' And a wife with a baby in her arms by his side! 'I have gone on to that sand and when I reached it, the cart began pushing me. I have looked back many times to see who was pushing my cart, but my eyes saw no one. I knew then that the angels of God were there.'\n\n\"Was I sorry that I chose to come by handcart? No. Neither then nor any minute of my life since. The price we paid to become acquainted with God was a privilege to pay, and I am thankful that I was privileged to come in the Martin Handcart Company.\"\n\nTODAY, Sisters, we have hospitals, anesthetics, nurses, and every comfort and attention for mother and the newborn child. Yet many a woman of America today limits her family to one, two, or three children, sometimes justifying herself because of economic conditions. They cannot get houses in which to live; the husband is in school; but more often they are yielding to a desire to keep up social prestige, and to participate in entertainment and travel.\n\nThe pioneer women bore the responsibilities of large families even though they had to pass through the throes of confinement under the most adverse circumstances. This tendency to limit the number of children in a family, if considered only in the light of perpetuating the race, is most portentous. We are told by the president of the American Statistical Association that in order to maintain our population even at its present level, it would be necessary that each family which has any children should have an average of over three.\n\n\"In other words, so many people are unmarried or else have no children, though married, that this number of children is needed to balance the deaths, and thus maintain a stationary population without any growth from year to year.\" The increasing tendency to look upon family life as a burden, and the ever-spreading practice of birth control are ominous threats to the perpetuation of our nation.\n\nIn the light of what the restored gospel teaches us regarding pre-existence, the eternal nature of the marriage covenant, and of family relationship, no healthy wife in the Church should shun the responsibilities of normal motherhood. In our homes, as we have heard here today, all that is best and noblest should live. And this in most cases largely emanates from mother. Her \"daily movements,\" as impressively expressed in Woman in the Home, \"as she walks and sits and sings and serves, turn common life into a drama of grace, beauty, and power. And when mother's heart, full of mother's love, obeys the inspiration of good taste, the living room of the lowliest house becomes a stage on which are illustrated, under the spell of holy faith and morality, all that is best in human life.... Who dares to undervalue it?\"\n\nToday, on the stage of international politics a great contention is taking place between two ideologies�one, that we take the children and make them hostages or wards of the state; the other, that upholds the Christian home. God grant that his will may prevail in the present conflict.\n\nTo womanhood everywhere, and especially to those in the West who prize their heritage, may the memory of the sterling character and heroic deeds of our pioneer mothers be an inspiration to foster and practice in their daily lives, courage, modesty, virtue, loyalty, and faith�outstanding traits of the Utah pioneer women!\n\nAnd will you pay your tribute to your mother, as I want to pay to mine, in the words that the prince paid to his: She of whom you speak, My mother, looks as pure as some serene creation minted in the golden moods Of sovereign artists; not a thought, a touch, But pure as lines of green that streaks the white Of the first snowdrop's inner leaves. (Tennyson)\n\nGod bless our mothers and our girls who hope to be mothers, that they may keep their bodies pure and unsullied, and merit from their sons the tribute we pay our mothers today, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen."

Why, then, is conflict mine alone?\n\nThe Lives of These\n\nObserve the cattle, hear the lonely loon;\nThe eagle soars where sky is thin and rare,\nTo plummet on his victim through the air;\nThe trout may swim his life in one lagoon.\nThe queen bee makes her nuptial flight at noon\nAnd nevermore ascends its blazing stair.\nThe coyote finds his goal in prey and lair,\nAnd sings his ghostly triumph to the moon.\n\nThe lives of these are bound and circumscribed\nBy laws unseen, immutable and fine.\nEach threads a path of cycles pre-described,\nWhile ultimate on ultimate is mine,\nAnd I must ever yearn for heights too far,\nEach star revealing yet another star.\n\nUnbound\n\nHave I not flown at will through star-hung space\nIn other worlds before this memory?\nAnd tapped the source of light and energy,\nAnd wrought my work unbound by time and place,\nUntrapped by circumstance? Can I erase\nNostalgic pangs, when alien to me\nAre clocks and cords and wheels?\nHave I been free\nTo know unmeasured joy and perfect grace?\n\nWhy have the centuries behind my blood\nBeen restless in the labored ways of toil?\nWhy have they sought to rise from rocks and mud\nTo flight, or pioneered, or burned the precious oil\nOf time for learning? Someday I shall go\nBeyond the sea of death—and I shall know.\n\n(For biographical sketch of Alice Morrey Bailey, see page 23.)\n\n**RUBY BAIRD ANDERSEN - Third Prize Poem: \"The Young War Widow Speaks\"**\n\nWhat good is a medal of oak leaves\nOn velvet in a case,\nWhen the mind holds on to pictures\nThe heart cannot erase?\n\nOn the town's memorial plaque\nWhen your only love has gone\nAnd can never, oh, never come back?\nOn the back-yard bench the spring sun lies\nWhere he liked to sit making fishing flies.\n\nNo alchemy could work\nIn teeming word or sun,\nIf the heath is put a withered cone.\n\nThe plum hangs ripe on the green-leafed limb,\nJust a little taller than the head of him.\nLearn, I must, of many things,\nAnd unlearn many more.\nWhat is the shape of memory?\nIs it twisted, pointed, and sharp?\n\nOr large, star-shaped, and smooth like the dulcet tones of the harp?  \nThe sumac is red near the canyon's mouth,  \nThree years since he went to camp in the South.  \nSeasons can return again,  \nNew life that is spring's,  \nExultation that belongs to Maytime,  \nAnd fruition that August brings;  \nBut blood and bone are passing,  \nAnd muscle cannot last,  \nPassion palpitates but once,  \nLife's momentum soon is past.  \nMemory often serves as bread,  \nOr as a drink from which one sips,  \nBut memory cannot place a kiss  \nFresh upon the lips.  \n\nThe snowflakes slant around the corner light,  \nThere's a mound that's cold in a foreign night.  \nIs it creeping centuries,  \nOr only a thousand hours?  \nThat by this casement window I've climbed the night's blue towers  \nTo find this word, this answer:  \nThere's One who understands;  \nI must lift my heart myself,  \nWith a pair of working hands.  \n\nRuby Baird Andersen, wife of Reuben Andersen of Provo, Utah, has two teen-age daughters and is a competent and charming homemaker.

Dean, 435 East 2d South, Provo, Utah, for her story \"Our Children's Children.\"\n\nThis story contest, first conducted by the Relief Society General Board in 1941 as a feature of the Relief Society centennial observance, was made an annual contest in 1943. The contest is open only to Latter-day Saint women who have not at least one literary composition published or accepted for publication by a periodical of recognized standing.\n\nThe three prize-winning stories are to be published consecutively in the first three issues of the Magazine for 1948.\n\nThirty-three manuscripts were submitted in the contest for 1947. Only one of the prize winners for this year had previously placed in the Annual Relief Society Short Story Contest.\n\nThis contest was initiated to encourage Latter-day Saint women to express themselves in the field of fiction. The General Board feels that the response to this opportunity will continue to increase the literary quality of Theand will aid the women of the Church in the development of their gifts in creative writing.\n\nMany of the stories submitted in the 1947 contest emphasized the moral theme to the detriment of the quality of the stories. It is suggested that the authors try to improve the literary craftsmanship of their submissions, giving the story plan and particular attention to character development, and giving careful attention to the fine details of word and sentence structure.\n\nThenow has a circulation of more than 85,000. There are subscribers in every state of the Union, and in many foreign countries, thus providing a varied and interested group of readers. Writers, recognizing this large and appreciative audience, realize the importance of centering the contest on their very best work.\n\nThe General Board congratulates the prize-winning contestants, and expresses appreciation to all those who submitted stories. Sincere gratitude is extended to the three who, in their discernment and skill in selecting the prize-winning stories.\n\nThe General Board also acknowledges the valuable contribution of the short story committee in supervising the contest.\n\nPage 17\n\nPrize-Winning Story\nAnnual Relief Society Short Story Contest\n\nFirst Prize Story\n\"Nugget of Truth\"\nAlice Mortey Bailey\n\nHer heels and looked at her small daughter, Penny, in dismay. It wasn't enough to have all this packing to do before the train would leave at six in the morning. On top of it, she must have this nagging worry about Penny.\n\n\"Just what did you tell the man at the door, Penny?\" \"I told him a great big elephant jumped out of the closet and ate you all up,\" said Penny, with a beatific smile. \"Now can we pack my dolly dresses?\"\n\n\"Penny, you didn't!\" \"Yes, I did, and I told him, besides, you haven't a minute to spare, and you look a sight!\"\n\n\"Oh,\" moaned Anna Lea. \"Whatever is Mommy going to do with you? And what is your Daddy going to think when we get to San Francisco, and he finds out you still tell fibs? You're a big girl now, more than four.\"\n\nBill wouldn't understand it, any more than she did, but there it was. Modern parents, Bill said, didn't let things like this go on. Wasn't there child psychology, or some way to get at the bottom of it and find out why Penny lied? Bill called it that. Lies.\n\nAnd it was no use for Anna Lea to talk of an over-active imagination, because Bill had been brought up in a strict household. He thought he was being liberal not to take his razor stop to Penny, or to lock her in the closet. He was going to, he said, if Penny wasn't cured by the time they got to San Francisco.\n\n\"It's up to you, Dear. You're the one who is with her all the time. I can't do a thing when I'm traveling like this,\" he had said. Bill was very young looking, but his jaw was firm, and if the truth had it, that was the real reason why\n\nNUGGET OF TRUTH\n\nhe had given up the job of troubleshooter on the Santa Fe and had taken a job in the office—so he could spank Penny and lock her in the closet.\n\nAnna Lea didn't know very much about children, but even she knew there should be a better way. Bill didn't know how big and heavy his hand was, and when Bill got angry he shouted.\n\n\"Who was the man at the door, Darling? Did he say?\"\n\n\"Oh yes! That was Mr. Jefferson, and he is one of Daddy's friends.\" The name didn't ring any bell in Anna Lea's memory. Bill was sweet. He had so many friends. He was big and ambitious and forthright.\n\nIt wasn't so much that she was afraid of Bill as it was that she was afraid he would stop loving her. \"A man's choice of a wife can't be overestimated,\" he said once. He was reading about a friend's divorce in the paper. \"You take Stubby, here. It says incompatibility in the paper, but it goes a lot deeper than that. Stubby was with me over there, and he thought he had the world wrapped up in a little blond cocoon, but what does he find when he gets home? The cocoon turns out to be a butterfly.\" \"Bill, that's clever!\" \"These war marriages! A guy gets all steamed up and heroic, and everything looks like hot stuff to him. He grabs off a last-minute marriage before he goes out to fight, and when he gets home he finds he's tied for life to some little ball of fluff, if not to a grindstone.\" \"Millstone, Bill,\" corrected Anna Lea, and added in a very small voice, \"ours was a war marriage.\" \"Right,\" said Bill, \"and did I know you? You had me so dazzled I didn't know what went on in that little head of yours.\" He had stood up then, to come and kiss her. \"And you still do,\" he said, his eyes growing warm, his lips circling her face with kisses. \"But I mean to find out.\" And when he did, what would he know? Would he still love her? Would he think she had character? He had thought so the day he had given her her watch—the day Penny was born. \"Honey,\" he had said, sitting beside the hospital bed after it was all over and she had rested, \"I brought you something.\" He had been down to send the good news telegrams. \"It's a good watch, the best there is. Just like your little heart, ticking away all the time you were bringing my baby. I'm so glad it didn't stop,\" he said, and his face crumpled, his voice too. There were tears on her hands when he snapped the watch on her wrist.\n\n\"K E K K & 'XX\"\n\nWHEN are we going to pack my dolly dresses?\" Penny's voice jolted her back into reality. Doll clothes were spread all over the overstuffed chair, enough of them to fill the space needed for Anna Lea's fur coat. \"Those old rags! Throw them away, Penny Dearest, and we'll get you some more when we get there.\" \"I couldn't,\" said Penny. \"This dress I bought at Moffats, and it costed millions of dollars. It's real velvet. And this one is silk, and it costed millions of dollars, too. Besides I made them all myself, and my dolls can talk to me when you are gone, and they told me while you were asleep that they just love their clothes.\" \"Oh, Penny,\" said Anna Lea in despair. \"Can't you tell the truth?\" \"This time I am,\" said Penny virtuously. \"They are really silk and velvet, and I really did pay millions....\" \"Penny!\" Penny's eyes filled with tears and she began to cry, her little lower lip trembling. Penny was still a baby, with a baby's contours curving into creases at her wrists and elbows, and at the base of her sweet little throat, where Bill said that kisses grew. \"How about a kiss for Daddy?\" he would say, and Penny would tip back her head. \"Are there any kisses there?\" \"Dozens of them,\" Bill would declare. \"Then you can have them,\" Penny would tell him, stopping her play dutifully, tangling his hair and laughing when he tickled her. Penny's dimpled features could go, as Bill said, from May flowers to April showers in a matter of split seconds, and just now they were all woe. Anna Lea couldn't hold out against the grief in the small face, and took Penny in her arms. \"There, Baby!\" she said, patting her. \"Will you pack my dolly dresses?\" Penny said, mollified and pressing quick advantage. \"Yes, yes, Dear. Mother will,\" promised Anna Lea, a little taken aback, and with mental reservations. I just can't! She thought. So much to pack—so little space. I'll have to think of something. \"Put them in your box and leave them. I'll have to see where they'll fit. Why don't you help Mother to remember all the things,\" she added, hoping to get Penny's mind off the doll clothes. It gave Anna Lea a headache to think of all the little, last minute details—services to be discontinued, a drayman for her trunks, and the countless friends who called, wanting to take her to lunch, to dinner, to a show on her last day here. She had run the gamut of excuses. \"I'd love to, Darling, but I have a terrific headache,\" or an appointment with the dentist, anything that came quickly to mind. \"We must remember our tooth brushes in the morning. We have to leave them out to use. Help me to remember to give the apartment key back to the manager, and to think of a good safe place to pack my jewelry....\" He had put her jewelry in every piece of luggage she had, her watch, her costume jewelry, and the emerald pin and earrings Bill had given her, only to take them out again. She picked up her watch, laying its smooth crystal to her cheek, thinking of Bill. It was a warm link between them. \"Mommy, let me wear your watch on the train,\" Penny asked. \"Of course not, Honey. I can't even wear it myself, because the link is broken.\" Her watch fascinated Penny. She would miss it acutely. She sighed and put it back with the little heap of jewelry on the desk. There were little heaps everywhere, her stockings and underwear, Bill's dress clothes, and Penny's dolls. It was  NUGGET OF TRUTH too much, and now there was that man, Bill's friend to worry about. She should have answered the door, herself, but it would have been too awful to have him see her like this, in slacks and mules, her hair in a kerchief and her face smudged with dust. And all this litter! Penny's doll clothes added the finishing touch. Penny was industriously packing them into her box, her face a miniature of housewifely concern. If Bill could only see her now! She was so adorable, her baby lips pursed, her round little fingers making their vague movements. Who could spank a child like that? \"Penny, would you like to play at Jamie's for half an hour?\" Anna Lea asked after a little busy silence.\n\nWHEN Penny had gone Anna Lea let herself out of the service entrance and into the elevator to the basement. She had a basket of things to be burned. Uppermost on it was the box of Penny's doll clothes, atrocious little things Penny had crudely fashioned from her own worn-out things, silk print and old velvet, badly cut, with raw edges and ridiculous stitching. She would really have to teach Penny to sew, now that she was old enough.\n\nIt was all trash, bits of crumpled lace, some artificial flowers matted with embroidery silk, and some stringy ribbons. Nevertheless, she had a guilty little pang as she put them into the fire, turning her face from the heat of the glowing coals. She watched the sides of the box darken with smoke and the edges begin to curl. There was an instant when she would have snatched them out, but they broke into flame, and it was too late. Millions of dollars, Penny had said. With a little constriction of her heart, Anna Lea shut the door on the burning doll clothes and went upstairs. She shut her eyes, but couldn't shut out the sight of the flame, browning the tiny sun-suit, licking the small blue coat. The telephone was ringing as she went back into the apartment, Western Union, calling with a telegram from Bill. Jefferson, the big boss, calling to see you en route East. Squelch Penny's imagination. Everything depends on good impression. Better job, more money. Jefferson stickler for truth. Poor Bill! He must have been fearful to have sent that. \"Oh!\" she said suddenly, \"Mr. Jefferson!\" The truth hit her like a landslide. That was Mr. Jefferson whom Penny had told an elephant had eaten her mother—the man at the door. This was too awful! Bill would never forgive her. What was worse, he would never forgive Penny. A stickler for truth, Bill had said. Anna Lea wished fervently she might dissolve in thin air. What should she do? Rectify the mistake, obviously, but how? Where did he stay? If she could call him and tell the absolute truth, invite him to dinner at her new home as soon as he returned to San Francisco, that might do it. Somehow she would fix things for Bill.\n\nSHE began calling the hotels. \"Is a Mr. Jefferson registered there?\" she asked repeatedly. After half an hour at the telephone, searching his whereabouts, she gave up. Anger overwhelmed her. Anger at Bill. What did he think, that you could tear your goods out of your home—well, your apartment—and be serenely calm enough to receive visitors? Anger at Penny. Bill was not so far wrong with his razor strops and closets—even closets inhabited with the terrifying \"elephants!\" of Penny's imagination. Why couldn't the child have said what she was told to say, that her mother had a headache, that she was ill? Even that now seemed a flimsy excuse. Anna Lea had supposed it to be some kind of joke. It could be Simmons from across the hall.\n\nShe was angry even at the unsuspecting Mr. Jefferson. Why, at least, couldn't he have telephoned? She was sitting beside her open trunk, her fingers pressing her throbbing temples, trying to think what next to do, when Penny burst in.\n\n\"I told Jamie I couldn't play any more because I have the measles and a broken leg, and besides I have to pack up baby's clothes.\"\n\nPenny stopped short, looking for the box. \"Did you pack them, Mommy? Did you put them in a suitcase?\" she asked apprehensively.\n\nAnna Lea, conscious of the guilt of being busy, did not answer. Penny came and stood before her in small implacability.\n\n\"Did you put my doll clothes in a suitcase, Mommy?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" mumbled Anna Lea in a preoccupied manner, lifting her stocking box into the tilt of her trunk with great care.\n\n\"Which suitcase did you put them in?\" Penny insisted.\n\nAnna Lea waved a vague hand at the set of bags and boxes.\n\n\"Oh Lord!\" Penny. One of those. I can't remember. We'll find out when we get to San Francisco,\" she evaded.\n\nI'll get her some real velvet and satin and make her dolls beautiful clothes the minute we get there, she promised herself. Penny subsided in a chair, not satisfied, but thoughtful. Anna Lea hoped, with a little sigh of relief, that the uncomfortable matter was closed.\n\n\"It was a really good place to pack your jewelry,\" Penny commenced in adult-like conversationalism.\n\n\"My jewelry!\" said Anna Lea, startled. \"What do you mean?\" The heap of jewelry was gone from the desk. \"Penny, where is Mother's jewelry?\"\n\n\"You said to help you find a good place, and I helped. I put it down in the middle of my baby clothes box. Wasn't I a good girl?\"\n\n\"You mean it's bumped? My jewelry—my watch that Daddy gave me—burned in the trunk?\" \n\nANNA Lea stood stock-still, remembering the flame that licked at the side of the box, remembering the glowing bed of coals beneath, the finger pointing at her. She stared at her, her eyes round and accusing.\n\n\"You burned up my dolly dresses, Mommy,\" she stated. \"You said you packed them.\"\n\nAnna Lea had a sick feeling, seeing the child's stricken face, sensing her own loss. Penny had loved those doll clothes as much as she had loved her watch.\n\nShe opened her mouth, the urge for excuses, palliatives, promises, strong upon her, but the moment was too deep, too significant. On it turned her whole life, her entire shop with Penny—with Bill. \"I told you a lie, Penny,\" she said, wrenching the words from their habitual sockets. \"A big, very bad lie. I did say I packed them. I did burn your baby clothes.\"\n\nPenny's sobs were heartbreak. \"Lana's velvet dress—Billy Boy's blue coat—burned!\"\n\nNo less burning was the vision of Bill's job, swept into the holocaust of Mr. Jefferson's disapproval, Bill's love for her, smoking in contempt, licked by the small flames of her own worth lies and deceits of convenience. She knelt beside Penny.\n\n\"I know how you feel, Penny. I've been a very bad mother. I know exactly how you feel!\"\n\nPenny stopped short, struck by an idea. \"My own pack them, Mommy? Daddy's pack—\"\n\n\"Don't cry, my pretty Mama,\" she wept on. \"My dolly's clothes didn't cost millions and millions of dollars,\nand I didn't buy them at Moffats. My dollies didn't tell me they loved them, because my dollies can't talk.\"\n\n\"Penny, you're telling the truth,\" marveled Anna Lea.\n\nPenny's eyes smiled tears and her little mouth trembled.\n\n\"Of course! I thought it was a lovely good place to pack your jewelry,\" she said contritely.\n\n\"Oh, Baby!\" And Anna Lea took Penny into her arms. The reason why Penny lied—the cure for it—lay like a nugget in the ashes of her loss.\n\nThe telephone rang, then, like a second chance. It was Mr. Jefferson.\n\n\"Just a moment,\" Anna Lea said cupping the mouthpiece. \"It was a good place, Penny Darling. A very good place!\"\n\nAlice Morey Bailey, musician, composer, sculptor, artist, and writer, is a remarkable artist! Latter-day Saint woman.

In the midst of trials and afflictions, how sweet, how solacing is the loyalty of friends. When the Prophet Joseph Smith was a prisoner in Liberty Jail, the Lord spoke these comforting words: \"Thy friends do stand by thee, and they shall hail thee again with warm hearts and friendly hands. Thou art not yet as Job; thy friends do not contend against thee neither charge thee with transgression as they did Job (D&C 121:9-10).\" It is a priceless gift to be able to rely on the loyalty of one's associates, to be certain that they will remain staunch and true in adversity. Every president of the Church has been surrounded by associates who would have been loyal to the death. That is an attribute of the Lord's apostles.\n\nIn any Church position to which a woman may be called, she owes full loyalty to those placed over her and to those with whom she labors. One of the reasons that the Relief Society is different from every other woman's organization on the face of the earth, is that the leaders are called by men bearing the Holy Priesthood, and seekers of positions are not called. When a woman is chosen for a position, she may expect the full loyalty of all the women with whom she works.\n\nIt is a sorrowful thing for a woman to be disloyal to those placed over her, or to be disloyal to those whom she professes to befriend. Those who would dwell in the presence of the Lord and belong to the Church of the Firstborn \"see as they are seen, and know as they are known.\" A sincere woman shuns associating with women whom she knows, from past experience, are disloyal to friends and associates. She knows that each person will have to answer! For every idle word spoken. Said Jesus, \"But I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment\" (Matt. 12:30).\n\nAs a woman increases in years she should increase also in all righteousness. Her appearance, more and more, comes to mirror the spirit within. Sweetness and goodness tend to illumine and refine. At the beginning of this new year, each Relief Society member will earn the approbation of the Lord if she keeps a stricter curb on her tongue, builds up her sisters, and proves her loyalty to friends and principles through her daily living.\n\nM.

    "content": "Olive W. Burt\n\nMiss Libby Gray, hurrying home with her groceries, had little reason to look about her. It was terrifically hot that midsummer day, and Miss Libby's one desire was to get back to her little cottage, to the shaded coolness of her vine-covered porch. But, as she rounded the corner of Twelfth Street, the billboard across the way struck through her preoccupation, and she stopped and stood there, the sun beating down on her funny little straw hat, as she gaped at the sign.\n\nThe circus!\n\nTime again. Miss Libby forgot the heat and the dust as she stared at the gay posters with their galloping horses, lovely women, and heroic men. At last she sighed, and moved on more slowly down the street. She had never seen a circus—never in all her long, drab years. She hadn't even wanted to see one—hadn't even thought about circuses—for a long, long time.\n\nShe could remember though, how much they had meant to her at one time. She could remember that summer morning when she was ten. Everyone in the village, it seemed to her, was going to the circus. Teddy James had asked her, \"You going to the circus, Libby?\" And when she told him that her father wouldn't let her go, Teddy had nodded wisely: \"Sure, it's circus mine won't either—that is, he won't give me the money to go. But me and the other fellows are going to carry water for the elephants. Man said he would give us free tickets.\"\n\n\"Oh, Teddy!\" Libby had begged, \"let me help! Let me carry water, too!\"\n\nBut it was a boy's job, and there were more boys wanting it than could have it. There was no place for her—a girl. She had stayed home that afternoon, sitting on the side porch, shelling peas, and hearing through the clear, blue summer air the sharp, sweet music of the calliope.\n\n\"Papa was just plain stingy!\" she said now, and was startled that she had given voice to the hitherto unacknowledged conviction. She felt a little ashamed, too, remembering that this very stinginess was the only thing that had made it possible for her to live as she had all these years, without having to work too hard or worry too much.\n\nShe went into her big, cool kitchen and laid her groceries on the table. As she went to put her change into the grocery money can, she gave a little start of surprise.\n\n\"Hmmm!\" she said, talking half aloud to herself as was her habit, because she was always alone and had no one else to talk to, \"I've sure been economical this month. There's more'n two dollars still left in the can.\"\n\nTwo dollars! Papa would have gone straight to the bank with it.\n\nBut then, Papa had had to skimp and save for her sake. \"But I don't!\" she said savagely.\n\n\"MISS LIBBY STEPS OUT\"\n\n\"I haven't a chick nor a child to pass my stuff on to.\" She stood there, staring at the two dollars, feeling terribly alone. Then, scarcely realizing that she had made a decision, she hurried into her little bedroom and changed her clothes. Glancing furtively over her shoulder as if afraid that Papa might be watching her, she took the change from the grocery money can. \"It'll mean I can't have a little roast Sunday,\" she muttered, but would not let her lips go on to say that this meant no cold meat on Monday and no hash on Tuesday. She shrugged. \"Eat too much meat, anyway!\" she said.\n\nHE bus to the circus grounds was crowded, but Miss Libby didn't care. She even liked it. She liked standing among the men and women and the jabbering, excited children. Her cheeks felt warm, and she knew her hat was askew, but she kept smiling at everyone and imagined everyone smiled at her.\n\nOnce at the circus grounds, she walked slowly, scuffling her feet to stir up little clouds of dust, wanting to feel and hear all the beauty and romance of the place. She bought some pink lemonade and some pink popcorn, and was just going to purchase a ticket to the fat lady side show when caution stopped her.\n\n\"Better get my ticket to the Big Top first,\" she said, her tongue loving the feel of the phrase, \"don't know how much it'll cost. Used to be twenty-five cents, but I've grown up since then.\" Reaching up to get her ticket from the uniformed man, who stood in one end of the red and gold van, was an adventure in itself. The ticket cost $1.50, so Miss Libby couldn't see any side shows. She shrugged. It didn't matter, anyway. The signs and barkers were just as good, maybe even better, than inside.\n\nUp and down the midway she roamed, letting her feet splash in the hot dust, letting her ears drink in the exciting disharmony of raucous-voiced barkers, chattering children, scolding parents, and trumpeting animals. But, at last, she went into the big tent, handed over her ticket, and with the high excitement of a love tryst, entered the dusty, noisy semidarkness.\n\nThe animals were even better than Miss Libby had ever imagined. She moved from cage to cage, past the lions pacing sedately to and fro, tossing their manes at each turn; past the tigers and jaguars, beautiful in their lithe grace. She stopped at the monkey cages, laughing aloud with the children beside her. She marvelled at the zebras and llamas, the camels and giraffes, just like their pictures. She watched little boys drop peanuts in the straw for the elephants to find with their long, sensitive trunks.\n\nAt last she sighed, gave a last look over the noisy, smelly oval, and went through the flap into the Big Top itself.\n\n\"Get reserved seats!\" the barker called, and Miss Libby's lips lifted scornfully. Any seat would be a reserved seat to her. She was going to take her time, though, and find the best place. She walked slowly, measuring the advantages of sitting near the reserved seats against those of being at the very end; of sitting in the first row with climbing to the top, where she could, perhaps, see more.\n\nAt last she found her place, not too far from the doorway, so she could see the grand entrances, and on the first row. \"Tl feel closer to 'em here,\" she told herself, wriggling her slight figure in among the scuffling little boys. It was wonderful!\n\nFrom the moment the band began to play and the grand spectacle passed dazzlingly around the big arena, Miss Libby found her two eyes—her five senses—were not enough. She watched the aerialists, the seals and lions and elephants, the bareback riders, the clowns. Particularly, the clowns.\n\nFor some reason, it seemed to Miss Libby that here, in the fanciful garb of these crazy tumblers, was the very spirit of the circus—the very heart of the great mystery that had called so urgently to her heart so many, many years ago. The clowns came around the sawdust circle in front of the seats— the giants and the dwarfs, the red-headed clowns and the blackfaced clowns, clowns with ridiculously big feet, and clowns with four feet, and clowns with no feet at all—tumbling, pulling faces, poking at the squealing children on the front row, taking the audience into the fun—into the glory that was the circus.\n\nMiss Libby watched, fascinated. She found herself giggling like the children around her, squealing, too, as a clown let loose a rubber mouse or fell from a kicking burro. Then, right in front of her, a little clown in a red-and-yellow suit began tumbling about, performing unbelievable antics—breaking himself in two, falling together again, while the children clapped, and Miss Libby rose from her seat in her excitement.\n\nAt last, the little clown drew himself upright, all in one piece, after all, and bowed sedately. Miss Libby was laughing as she could not remember ever having laughed before, laughing like a little girl, and clapping her hands. The little clown looked straight into Miss Libby's eyes. His own eyes were blue and merry, but as they looked into Miss Libby's brown ones, they grew suddenly serious in his grotesque, painted face. It seemed to Miss Libby that the clown's eyes were speaking to her, were saying something she couldn't quite catch, though her heart stood still for a moment, listening.\n\nThen he bowed again and went running and tumbling out of the tent. The rest of the show seemed a little less exciting now. Miss Libby kept turning from the dazzling aerialists and the performing lions to search among the clowns for that one funny little figure. He didn't come in again, and Miss Libby wondered what he could be doing. Maybe he has other jobs to do, she thought, sadly, and him the best clown they have. It's a shame!\n\nWHEN the circus was over, Miss Libby was pushed out of the tent by the surging crowd around her—out into a sunlight grown drab and a day that held no mystery. She couldn't bear the thought of going home. She walked about among the tents, watching the crowd thin until there were only a few loiterers like herself scattered about. She saw, at one side of the big field, a long tent, and smelled the odors of cooking that came from it. Stiffening her backbone and giving her timidity a mental shaking, she walked toward it.\n\nHer courage fading, the wrong figure came toward the cook-tent. Miss Libby recognized him at once—not from his face, which was no longer grotesque, but was friendly and human; not from his clothes, which were ordinary gray slacks and shirt, but from the quick, precise movements and the blue, merry eyes.\nMiss Libby stared. That's how a clown looks in real life! she thought, and she envied him the paint and clothes that were his transport into wonderland.\n\"Oh, Mister!\" she cried, before she knew it.\nThe little man stopped, looked at her sharply, and nodded.\n\"Good evening, ma'am,\" he answered.\nMiss Libby's words came straight from her heart, not waiting to be censored by her mind or her sense of propriety.\n\"Oh, Mr. Clown, I thought you were the best thing in the whole circus! I never saw anything like you. Would you�\" Now\nshe began to stumble. \"Would you read this? I've read about�\"\nThe little man came close to her. He was smiling and his eyes looked happy.\n\"Yeah,\" he said, \"I saw you there—in the front row, you were, weren't you? Not many ladies sit there—mostly kids. So you liked my act, eh?\"\n\"Oh, yes!\" she breathed. \"It was marvelous. I—I waited here hoping I would see you so I could tell you�\"\n\"That's mighty nice of you, ma'am,\" the man said, and there was all of the circus in his voice. \"Mighty nice! Not many people do that any more.\"\nMiss Libby was fumbling in her bag. She brought out a little card and a stub of a pencil.\n\"Would you,\" she began, and then went on apologetically, \"I've never had anyone's autograph—I never wanted one before—but if you only would—I could sort of look at it and remember�\"\nShe was holding out the little white square with an unconsciously pleading gesture.\nThe little man surely beamed at her unbelievably. Then his eyes grew suddenly bright, and his voice shook a little as he asked, \"You mean—do I mean you want my autograph? Say, lady—\" The little circus man took the card from her. He stood staring at it for a moment, and then asked gently, \"What is your name, Lady?\"\nMiss Libby told him, and he lifted his pencil. He cried, \"I never saw anyone like you. Would you—\" Now the unbelievable sight—of a little gray-clad figure standing firmly on one leg, writing upon an uplifted knee. It was better than the circus, itself. When he had finished, he handed her the card, with a deep bow.\n\"There you are, Madame,\" he said, and Miss Libby felt herself grow tall and lovely. \"And thank you. You have made me very happy.\" Made you happy?\" she whispered, and stared after him as he went into the tent. Then she looked at the card, holding it close to her eyes to read in the fading afternoon light: To Miss Libby Gray—the greatest little lady that ever watched me perform, with deep appreciation for her kind heart. Roy, the Clown.\nMiss Libby went home, now. Her day was over. She put the card in the corner of her dresser looking glass, and long after she had stretched out in bed, the little square twinkled and smiled at her, and the memory of happiness was sweet around her.\n\nA NEW YEAR\nClarence Edwin Flynn\n\nIsn't it good to put by the fears\nAnd cares and worries of all the years;\nTo take the debits of sorrows known,\nThe strifes and wrongs of the days agone,\nThe unkind words and the unkind looks\nTogether, and charge them off the books?\n\nIsn't it good to have a day\nTo put the wrongs and mistakes away,\nThe disappointments and failures,\nToo, and let the thought of them all be through,\nTo close the page on the hurt and strife,\nAnd open a new account with life?\n\nREMEMBER THE BIRTHDAYS OF WOMEN IN YOUR FAMILY WITH A SUBSCRIPTION TO THEAN ATTRACTIVE GIFT CARD WILL BE SENT TO RECIPIENTS OF GIFT SUBSCRIPTIONS\n\nAddress: TheBishop's Building, Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nA Decade of Doing"

    "content": "Dorothy Ducas [Issued by The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis]\n\nInfantile Paralysis, supported by the now-familiar March of Dimes each January, will be ten years old on January 3, 1948. Ten years, in history, is but a moment. To mothers and fathers it is half their children's lives as children.\n\nWhat has happened to speed the fight against infantile paralysis in the decade is of immediate interest and concern to all parents...\n\nLet's list a few of the things it has done in its ten-year span:\n\nFirst, it has become an organization with 2,735 local branches called chapters, manned by local volunteers, friends and neighbors of all of us. These local branches are the focal points for families in which infantile paralysis occurs, for from them comes financial assistance for the medical care of patients whose families cannot afford the complete costs without aid.\n\nIn the period between May, 19309, when the first chapter was formed, and December 31, 1947, chapters have given direct assistance to an estimated 88,000 patients, according to reports from National Foundation representatives in all the states. In some instances, this assistance meant payment of all medical charges: hospital, medical, nursing, physical therapy, transportation to and from hospitals and clinics.\n\nIn others, it meant the provision of a wheelchair, of braces, or perhaps a pair of crutches.\nThis service has been available to everyone in need of help, National Foundation for regardless of age, race, creed or color...\n\nSecond, the chapters of the National Foundation have provided funds for staffing and equipping polio units in local hospitals in many places, so that medical care would be available if polio came. In 1938, there were some 300 hospitals that admitted polio patients in the acute stage of the disease, according to the best available estimates. Today, there are at least 717 polio units in the country accepting acute cases...\n\nThe importance of the growth of treatment centers is underlined by medical authorities. They agree that early diagnosis and hospitalization can do more to prevent deformity and minimize crippling than any other one procedure now known...\n\nFOLIO treatment has been changing in the last ten years. There is more stress today on early physical therapy. Here was one field where qualified workers were so scarce that money itself could not buy enough or efficient enough services for polio patients—without helping to create new physical therapists. The National Foundation in 1945 set aside $1,267,600 to train physical therapists at approved schools and to create new teachers for these schools. As a result, 893 physical therapy scholarships had been granted up to October 1, 1947, increasing the supply of these workers by about twenty-five per cent.\n\nAdequate polio treatment is an expensive item beyond the reach of\nthe average budget. It is estimated each patient hospitalized for a year costs $2,000, while iron lung cases can cost as much as $20,000. Because of this, chapter treasuries frequently run dry under the pressure of a major outbreak.\n\nWhen this happens, money is transferred from national headquarters to supplement chapter funds, which consist of fifty per cent of all March of Dimes receipts in the county. A total of $9,415,900 has been transferred to date to supplement chapter funds for patient care, $6,200,521 of it during the twelve months ending May 31, 1947, when 1,187 advances were made to 677 chapters. A group of women volunteers, specially trained to assist nurses and physical therapists in bedside care of polio patients in hospitals and homes, has been formed during the last three years. The Polio Emergency Volunteers, or PEVs, as they are called, have made it possible to spread the services of professional workers by relieving them of routine tasks so they have more time for skilled services. There are now about 9,000 PEVs throughout the county...\n\nThese steps forward in the field of patient care have been matched by achievements in scientific research and professional education. Since the National Foundation made its first research grant only a little more than six months after it was formed, the most intensive and comprehensive attack ever made on a single disease has been set in motion. Dozens of the country's leading scientists today are directing the search for knowledge and the training of professional workers at fifty of the most famous universities and medical schools in the United States. All told, 540 projects at 83 institutions in 29 states have been financed in ten years...\n\nAll these things have taken place within ten years. The final goal has not been reached, but knowing what has been done to relieve discomfort and pain, to prevent deformity, to minimize crippling, and to give every polio patient a fighting chance for the best possible recovery is a heart-warming thing to parents. It is comforting, too, to know that widespread and capable efforts are being made and continuously pursued to find a final solution to infantile paralysis. Because the National Foundation has done these things in its brief decade of doing, the appeal for continued support during the March of Dimes, January 15th to 30th, 1948, falls on responsive hearts. Men and women everywhere, and especially civic leaders and club women to whom this cause is of special interest, are urged to participate in the 1948 March of Dimes—to the end that the work of the last ten years may continue to ultimate victory.\n\nShein Arizona A communication from Arizona indicates that the Magazine is very much appreciated by the men, as well as by the women. One particular man \"likes the Magazine so well he can hardly wait for it to come each month.\" One day he and his wife were out riding in the car and he had the Magazine reading it while his wife drove the car.\"\n\nHow to Cover an Umbrella"

    "content": "Anna Prince Redd\nT was August 1884. Twilight fell and deepened the already sultry night.\n\"It is too hot to last!\" Elizabeth exclaimed. \"There will be a bad storm somewhere tonight, though I doubt if it will be here.\"\nThe darkness that had fallen over the landscape was more than just a natural withdrawal of light. Elizabeth felt lonely and afraid, not of exactly, or see. And most of all, she was afraid of her thoughts. Afraid of the years ahead.\nThe air was unusually fragrant with ripening fruit, yet oppressive and ominously heavy. She looked at the sky. Not a star showed through the heavy clouds that were rolling up like billows.\n\"What a night for Indian devilment,\" she said to herself. \"I'm glad the children are all asleep and that Henry will soon be home.\"\nShe was fascinated by the elemental fury that seemed to be held 'n check only because there was no reason for unleashing it. She heard the long, hollow cry that preceded the rumble of distant thunder, she showed no surprise. Rather, there was a profound interest.\nThe cry was cavernous in its intensity, yet seemed to come from a long way off. It was the same weird warning that had come at Lost Spring, announcing the coming of the famished water scouts. The same mysterious, half-human, half-animal cry that she had waited so long to hear.\nHenry came running from the river.\n\"Bejay, are you there?\" he cried. \"Betby!\"\n\"What has happened, Henry?\" Elizabeth asked, dazed by his sudden appearance, brought to reality by the excitement in his voice.\n\"I don't know, Bethy! But listen!\" The long, hollow cry was repeated. Elizabeth, listening to it, sensitive to its faint inflection, was shocked at the agitated warning it carried.\n\"Someone is running steadily in the darkness!\" Henry whispered.\n\"Yes. The lamps are lighted at Jamar's store. Whoever it is is running in that direction!\"\n\"I can't see anything,\" Henry confided. \"If there is trouble James will need me. Betby, you go inside and bolt the door.\"\n\"I'm not afraid, Henry. Do you remember hearing that strange cry ever before?\"\nHenry stopped, just as he had turned to go to James' assistance. \"Yes. Yes!\" he cried, growing more excited. \"It's the same cry we heard at Lost Spring!\"\n\"It's a warning, Henry. I don't like it. It may not have anything to do with this impending storm, or earthquake, or whatever it is that is shaping around us. It is a terrible cry—but remember we must not be powerless against it!\"\n\nThe Indians are being badly treated by scheming white men and traders in wool and sheep, and by unwise cowboys, to say nothing of the bungling of the soldiers. There'll be trouble at the store, I'm sure. They seem to congregate there, Indians as well as whites.\"\n\n\"James and his family have nothing to fear from the Indians, Henry. And I feel safer out of the fort than I did when we were in it. Fair treatment is essential to peace, in this mission. And the Indians have had it from all of us, here at Montezuma. Go quickly to the store, Henry, if it will make you feel better. But come back as soon as you can.\"\n\nElizabeth went inside and bolted the door. She listened till she could not hear Henry's footsteps, and then she threw herself, face down, across her bed. All the bitter homesickness of the years welled up to choke her. Neither she nor Mary had known an hour of complete contentment since they had come to San Juan. The river bed had proved to be no place to build homes, and the farther back they would build, the more. Ravenous the \"Devil Ditch\" had become.\n\nOne day the river would be flowing peacefully toward the Colorado, the next it would have bitten out a chunk of beautiful farm land, green with grain, and be going in another direction. Not satisfied with its daily gorging, periodically it would rise and devour everything in its path, leaving islands of quicksand to ensnare more prey.\n\n\"We'll never be safe,\" Elizabeth wailed, as she thought of the river's ravages. \"Never!\"\n\nHENRY came back. He gave the door a sharp rap, followed by a light one—a signal that it was he. Elizabeth opened the door.\n\n\"What time is it?\" she asked, as if she had forgotten why he had been away.\n\n\"It's midnight,\" Henry answered. \"The Indians are gathering at Mitchell's ranch. I think we had better move back to the fort.\"\n\n\"And I think that we'd better stay right here!\" Elizabeth replied emphatically.\n\n\"Henry, I feel uneasy about the flood. Can you tell if it has been raining, up country?\"\n\n\"It doesn't look like it,\" Henry answered. \"But you never can tell.\" He looked at the black canopy overhead. \"We could have a deluge here, though. I never saw things so black!\"\n\nHe waited, then went on, \"I don't like the sultry heaviness in the air.\"\n\n\"Come inside, Henry!\" Elizabeth warned, drawing him within.\n\n\"There is another stealthy prowler!\" Henry whispered, \"Could you see anything?\"\n\n\"No. It's nerve-wracking.\" A quick rap at the door startled them. Elizabeth caught Henry's hand in the darkness. Neither spoke. There was a listening pause, and the knock was repeated. Henry reached for his gun.\n\n\"Make a light,\" he ordered, \"and stand back!\"\n\nElizabeth complied. The door swung open, creaking on its dry, leather hinges, concealing Elizabeth as she followed its arc.\n\n\"How!\" The low guttural was impatient and sharp. \"White man wait too long. Me knock. Most times no see!\"\n\nElizabeth came from behind the door.\n\n\"Se Kish!\" she cried. \"My friend!\"\n\nHenry looked from the majestic Indian to Elizabeth. \"Friend!\"\n\nThe Indian began talking directly to Henry.\n\n\"White man take squaw and papooses to high land. River he come. Maybe so daylight. No house here! No house there!\"\n\nHis arms described his words. \"Homes all go. No fence. No land!\"\n\nHenry shook his head in disbelief.\n\n\"I believe him, Henry!\" Elizabeth cried. \"Let me talk to him.\"\n\nShe pushed Henry aside and went closer to the Indian.\n\n\"You Jim Joe?\" she asked.\n\nThe Indian drew back, surprised.\n\n\"How you know?\" he questioned.\n\n\"White Mary told me. Jim Joe, does White Mary know about the flood?\"\n\n\"White Mary will be safe from river. One more house. Missionary Haskell, he safe, too.\"\n\n\"When will river take house?\" Elizabeth asked, conviction growing with her excitement.\n\n\"Maybe so nine, maybe so ten,\" the Indian answered. He gave Henry a slight, but imperative shove.\n\n\"White man stand too long. Talk too much!\"\n\n\"Ya tah!\" he said to Elizabeth, and was gone.\n\nThe blackness enveloped him, even against the candle-light and the open door.\n\nElizabeth pushed the heavy door shut.\n\n\"The river! I hate it!\" She covered her face with her shaking hands.\n\n\"I don't know what to think,\" Henry said. \"It's hard to believe that there will be a flood, when there isn't, or hasn't been a drop of rain.\"\n\n\"Just the same, Henry Harriman, the flood will come. And when it does, Henry we'll not have a chance.\"\n\nELIZABETH looked around at her pioneer home, grown suddenly very important, very dear. There were all her cooking pans and kettles, hanging above the chimney; her cupboard, with its pretty dishes brought from home; her braided rugs, her Indian blankets, soft and lovely in the candlelit room.\n\nShe went to the bedroom and, holding her hand around the candle flame so it would not shine in the children's faces, she looked at the wooden bedsteads, the handmade chest, the bright rag carpet on the floor.\n\n\"This is all we have,\" she told Henry, who had followed her. \"And the 'Devil Ditch' will get it, just as it has taken everything else!\"\n\n\"Elizabeth, I'm not taking any strange Indian's word on a thing like this. It's a trick. I don't believe him.\"\n\n\"The dawn is coming soon, Henry,\" Elizabeth reminded him. \"I'll wake the children. You get the wagon ready.\"\n\nThe finality in her voice was too convincing to argue against, and Henry went to get the wagon.\n\nElizabeth put all the food they had into sacks and cans, boxes, and buckets, remembering how little they had had during those first hard months, remembering the little grave on the hillside.\n\n\"That is one thing the river won't take,\" she spoke softly. \"Little brown-eyed lamb of a child!\"\n\nShe folded the rugs, the bedding that was not in use, and, last of all, put their few clothes on top of the stack, ready for loading.\n\n\"We'll have no room for furniture,\" she said, watching Henry as his eyes went lingeringly from piece to piece of the things his hands had made. He shook his head in perplexity.\n\n\"What will the neighbors say?\" he asked Elizabeth. \"This is a silly thing to do.\"\n\n\"Start loading, Henry,\" was all Elizabeth could say.\n\nShe placed a crocheted doily exactly in the center of the hewn-log table and put a vase of wild flowers exactly in the center of the doily. She stood back and surveyed the entire poorly furnished room.\n\n\"I never thought it was pretty before,\" she confessed, and wiped the mist from her eyes.\n\n\"It's time to wake the children, Henry.\"\n\nHenry looked at her pityingly. Whether this was a foolish thing to do or not, it was breaking Elizabeth's heart. He took an armload of the things and put them in the wagon.\n\nHIGHER and higher the \"Devil Ditch\" rose.\n\nOld banks caved into the boiling, half-mile wide river, to be followed in turn by the new banks. The floors of houses floated like rafts on the gray, tossing waters of the river. On one of these was a rocking chair, swinging madly back and forth, its cushions gay and dry, for the house had been lifted, land and all, and carried away. Chunk by chunk, the earth had loosened and tumbled into the swirling water, leaving the floor to float downstream. The roof and wall logs had one by one toppled off in the bad bouncing of the floor, till only the rocking chair remained. Houses, furniture, haystacks, wagons—everything that goes to make a home—careened by, jamming the river with debris. The Montezuma water wheel went out. The dam buckled and shivered. It held the wall of water for one defiant second, and then loosened and tossed the floating water wheel into the air, received it as it fell, and then flattened out, just another broken mass of trees and rocks and logs. Hens squawked in floating chicken coops; dogs and cats tried to climb to the tops of the houses, screeching in terror. From vantage points of safety, the hapless settlers watched their last remaining possessions go by. For thirty miles up the river where the cloudburst had started, not a house was left standing. At Montezuma, only two houses remained, those of James Davis and Thales Haskell.\n\nWHERE TRAILS RUN OUT\n\nThere was a half hour of tense excitement when it was discovered that the Allen family was not among the rescued ones who starkly watched the ravage of their lands. \"Sister Allen is missing!\" Ted Davis cried. \"I saw her son Bob up at the fort, trying to pacify the Indians.\" \"And Brother Allen is in Fruitland, New Mexico!\" James Davis exclaimed. \"The family will be surrounded! Get help, Ted, and follow me!\" \"There's no time to lose, Pa!\" Ted cried. \"I'd better come with you!\" \"That may be so,\" James agreed, jumping on his horse, and riding at top speed toward the Allen ranch. Ted followed him, keeping his eyes open for any men who might be able to go along to help, but he saw no one who was not already fully occupied with his own problems.\n\n\"Thank goodness their house is on a small mound,\" James shouted, as they raced along. \"Yes, but there's a swale on three sides of it!\" Ted reminded his father. \"It will be completely flooded.\" And it was. The little house, up to the window sills in water, looked forlorn and dejected. Two of the girls, Annie and Lizzie, were floundering in water up to their arm-pits, trying to rescue their chickens and a pig. \"Mother's inside,\" Annie shouted. \"The water is covering everything!\" James and Ted swung from their saddles and opened the door. There stood Mrs. Allen, holding her two young children out of the water. She had put the chairs on the bed and the children on the chairs. She was thoroughly frightened, alone and helpless.\n\n\"Oh, Brother Davis,\" she cried, \"I'm thankful that you have come! How are we going to keep from drowning?\" \"We'll get you out somehow, Aunt Jane,\" Ted Davis assured her. \"But I don't know how!\" The water was rising rapidly. The chairs on top of the bed were almost covered.\n\n\"We've got to get out of the house,\" James said. \"But where to go is the next thing. We can't all six of us ride our two horses out, and there's not time enough to make two trips!\"\n\n\"I know, Pa!\" Ted cried. He had been looking around for something that would solve the problem for them. \"There's the molasses boiler. We could use it as a boat!\"\n\nPhilip W. Tompkins\n\nARCH IN ROCK CREEK CANYON\nSoutheastern Utah\n\n\" But then how would we get it to dry land, Ted? Our horses can't wade out to the boat and pull the boiler, too,\" Mrs. Allen said after much persuasion.\n\nTed Waded out to the boat and was lifted onto it. \"Girls, it looks like it's not all funny,\" he said. \"We have to go for help.\"\n\nThere were moments when the swimming two girls who were trying to save an urchin were almost under the chicken coop. When the swimming team found solid footing, Lizzie cried, \"It's our father!\" James turned in time to see Brother Allen leaping from his saddle and sinking into the river. Mary Davis watched block after block of their land sink into the river.\n\nThey decided to use the molasses boiler for a boat,\" Ted explained. \"Can we pull it out?\"\n\nThere was no time to worry about cutting under the bank where the trees had been planted, and moisture. Three years she had watched them grow from pit to orchard! Now they were gone!\n\n\"There's no time!\" James decided, and jerked the team forward.\n\nMary jumped into the crack and put inside of it four feet wide and six or seven feet up by the roots. She had five young saplings. \"There go our lovely painted hawthorns,\" she cried. \"Now all our good fruit will be spoiled.\"\n\nThe river had already begun to cut under the bank where the trees had been planted, and moisture. Three years she had watched them grow from pit to orchard!

The hot dishes are there, products of old Spain, the Aztecs, and Mexico. Some of them are wonderfully good, but eating them is a matter of choice, not necessity. Much of the Mexican cookery is too intricate for the servantless American housewife. Some of the simpler dishes, however, are worth bringing north of the border. This time I shall write of only three—all easy to make, inexpensive, and good. I have no legitimate recipes for them. They came to me by word of mouth and by watching. Hence, the measurements here are meant as suggestions only. Vary them to suit your fancy and your numbers.\n\n1. Rice soup (Sopa de arroz)\n2. Zucchini with pork (Calabacitas )\n3. Tortillas with cheese (Tortillas con queso)\n\nSopa de arroz is not soup, according to North American standards, but a nourishing, one-dish meal for luncheon or dinner. There is no set way to make it. The contents depend more upon the state of the refrigerator and the market basket.\n\nHere is a guiding recipe:\n\nRICE SOUP (Serves Four)\n1 cup rice (uncooked)\n1 - 2 tbs. Fat\n3 - 4 cups of soup stock or water\nPage 48\n\ntbs. Chopped onions\ncup diced celery\ncup green peas\nlarge carrot, sliced\n2-3 tomatoes\nparsley\nsalt\nPepper\na few drops of Worcestershire sauce\na few drops of Tabasco sauce\n\nTurn a cup of uncooked rice into a heavy frying pan, sizzling with your favorite shortening. Keep the rice turning until it is seared with fat but not browned. This should take about five minutes. Now turn the rice into a heavy saucepan, which contains the 3 or 4 cups of boiling liquid, preferably soup stock and chicken, if available. Lacking soup stock, use water and bouillon cubes. Add to the rice mixture the sliced onions, which have been sautéed a delicate, golden brown, a cup of diced celery, two or three ripe tomatoes (use canned tomatoes or juice in off seasons), a large carrot sliced in thin wheels, a handful of chopped parsley. Then add the seasonings. When the rice is almost done, remove the cover and place a cup or so of freshly shelled green peas, canned peas or string beans, if you prefer, on top to steam until they are tender. You may also add strips of bell pepper, green or red, or both.\n\nThe Mexican way of cooking this dish is to use an open kettle and stir occasionally. Mindful of vitamins, I use a heavy aluminum dish. After the rice is boiling nicely, I turn the heat low and let it steam. You will like the flaky rice and the blend of tastes. Tan Sabroso!\n\nZUCCHINI WITH PORK (Serves Four)\n%-1 Ib. Pork cut in cubes\n1 Ib. Zucchini (Italian squash) cut in cubes\n2-3 cups corn, fresh or canned\na few strips of chili pepper\nsalt\n\nThirty minutes, a few strips of chili pepper, tortillas, sprinkle d place on a May be Care must be take; electric, portable oven jis party amounts.

Dean, Co-ordinator, Northern Utah Region, Church Welfare Plan, reports that the members of the Huntsville Ward Relief Society received several outstanding awards at the Utah Centennial Exposition of Fine Arts. The articles, which had been made as part of the Welfare assignment, were: Pair of mittens—First Prize; Pair of mittens—Second Prize; Handmade rug—First Prize; Silk quilt—Third Prize; Crocheted Rug—Second Prize.\n\nBrother Dean comments: \"This speaks very highly of the type of work which the Huntsville Ward Relief Society sisters are doing at their work meetings for the Welfare Program.

Fowler, President, Pasadena Stake Relief Society, reports a unique entertainment in honor of the old folks of the stake in which a prize was offered for the most unusual and effective table decoration. Alhambra Ward received the prize for its presentation of a covered wagon train which was devised and arranged by Ella Carpenter. She used twenty-four characters posed against a desert background. All details were complete, even to blinders for the horses, the implements fastened to the wagons, and the furnishings inside the wagons. The elderly people very much enjoyed this realistic picture of the historic days of '47.

Mortensen, President, Phoenix Stake Relief Society, reports that during the year 1946-47 three special projects were sponsored to promote interest and to stimulate activity among the visiting teachers. \"'First was a contest in which the teaching requirements were divided into four groups. Each teacher was to make a barometer for each month. These were divided into four parts, and the four phases of teaching activity were each represented by one-fourth of the barometer, which was filled whenever that particular phase of the work was completed. The four phases were: 1. Doing the teaching the first week in the month; 2. Every home contacted; 3. Attendance at visiting teachers meeting; 4. Message given in the home. At the close of the year's work a convention for all visiting teachers was sponsored, at which teachers who had completed their work, as indicated by the barometers, were signally honored and each was presented with a small book as a token of appreciation.\" NOTES FROM THE FIELD 55 Photograph submitted by Grace F.

B. Colton (Reference: Jesus the Christ, Chapters 13 and 14, by Elder James E. Talmage)\n\nFor Tuesday, April 6, 1948\n\nObjective: To prove that Jesus is no respecter of persons, but that his blessings are given to all who have faith in him, and who serve him.\n\nIn order for one to grasp fully the great work of our Lord, one must know something of the conditions existing among the people in the land where he lived his earthly life. Much bodily work was done, both by Jesus and his disciples, among the people of Samaria. The Samaritans were despised by the Jews, and, in time, this hatred became mutual. The inhabitants of both the province and city of Samaria were a mixed people. The province lay between Judea and Galilee. Assyrians and other heathen nations had intermarried with the Israelites of Samaria, yet all claimed to be descendants of Jacob. Geikie, in his Life and Words of Christ, says, \"They (the Samaritans) became even more rigidly attached to the law of Moses than the Jews themselves.\" The Jews, however, would not recognize these people. Some of the practices between the two groups became utterly ridiculous. Hatred prevented any co-operation.\n\nPage 58\n\nA Perry Picture\nFrom a Painting by Bida (1813-1895)\n\nJESUS TEACHING IN THE SYNAGOGUE\n\nThe woman failed to see the spiritual meaning in his words. He then proceeded to give her a significant lesson:\n\nJesus answered and said unto her, \"Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life\" (John 4:13-14).\n\nThe woman could only see a possible saving of labor, while Jesus was promising eternal spiritual life to a thirsting soul. The Lord also gave the woman a demonstration of his power of discernment.\n\nWhen he asked her to go get her husband, she replied: \"I have no husband.\" Jesus said unto her, \"Thou hast well said, I have no husband: For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband.\" She knew, then, that she spoke to no ordinary mortal. Jesus had read her innermost thoughts and her past life.\n\nThe Samaritan, convinced that Jesus was, at least, a great prophet, went and brought a group of her townspeople. Prior to going, she had remarked: \"I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.\" To her utter amazement, Jesus replied: \"I that speak unto thee am he\" (John 4:25-26).\n\nDisregarding the objections of his disciples, Jesus talked to these Samaritans and sowed the seeds that later resulted in a harvest of souls (Acts 8:5-14). The gospel is for every soul who will accept it. That truth was difficult for the disciples of Jesus to comprehend.\n\nAfter leaving Samaria, our Lord went to Cana. He knew full well that Nazareth would reject him. His remark: \"A prophet hath no honour in his own country,\" is often quoted. A remarkable event occurred at Cana. A nobleman of high rank came and pleaded with Jesus to go on to Capernaum and heal his son. This man was probably an official in Herod's government.\n\nJesus knew the man's thoughts and said unto him: \"Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.\" The man, however, continued his importunities, and the merciful Savior finally said to him: \"Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way\" (John 4:50). The son lived and both the man and his family accepted the gospel.\n\nFrom Cana, Jesus went again to Nazareth. He found but little faith there. He did, however, go to their service in the synagogue on the Sabbath. He read from the roll, or book, that was handed him, from the sixty-first chapter of Isaiah, a passage specifically referring to the coming of the Messiah. When the eyes of all the congregation were turned toward him, he said: \"This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears\" (Luke 4:21). They scoffed at his claim and tried to throw him over the cliffs of a nearby hill. \"But he passing through the midst of them went his way\" (Luke 4:30).\n\nAt Capernaum and in other parts of Galilee, he preached in the synagogues and did many mighty miracles. He cast out evil spirits from those afflicted. Even the devil cried out: \"I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God.\" He healed the sick, and many were converted - too many probably - by reason of the miracles he performed.\n\nContinuation of the Ministry in Galilee\n\nThe observant reader of the New Testament will be impressed with the humility of the Mighty One. He turned so frequently to the Father, whose work he had come to do, and was always so mindful of their relationship that one who wants to follow this great leader must needs be humble.\n\nSimon Peter, and others, wanted Jesus to remain in Capernaum, but he said unto them, \"I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also; for therefore am I sent.\" As he journeyed, a man afflicted with the loathsome disease of leprosy knelt before him and humbly asked: \"If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.\" Jesus was touched by this pathetic and sincere pleading, and laid his hand upon the afflicted one and cleansed him of the leprosy, although he was full of it (Mark 1:40-45). The Lord fully demonstrated his obedience to law by telling the former leper to immediately report to the priest of the healing and to make the offering required under the Mosaic law. He further charged the man to keep silent regarding the miracle. The Savior quite generally discouraged any publicity.\n\nShortly after the event just mentioned, Jesus was again in Capernaum. In fact, he seemed to have made his home in this place more than in any other of the cities. He 61 was preaching one day in a house which was so crowded that there was no room nor any way for more people to get in to hear him. There was a man afflicted with palsy. Both he and his friends were anxious to reach Jesus, but were unable to do so. Finally, they devised the ingenious plan of going to the roof and either made a hole or took the sick man through the trapdoor and lowered him, by means of ropes and a mattress, until he was in the presence of Jesus. The Lord first looked with compassion on the sufferer and said: \"Son, thy sins be forgiven thee!\" The Jews, hearing this, accused him of blasphemy because they felt it was dishonoring God; that no one but God had the right to forgive sins. The Master however, made the statement to the Twelve: \"Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained\" (John 30:23). This same power was given to Peter on a previous occasion. It is required of us that we forgive all men. God will forgive \"whomsoever he will forgive.\"\n\nA dispute then arose as to whether it is easier to forgive sins or to heal one afflicted with palsy. The Savior, in effect, answered by doing both. He spoke to the palsied man as follows: But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins,... I say unto thee, Arise and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house\" (Mark 2:10-11). The man obeyed and to the amazement of the people, was fully healed. The comforting statement, \"thy sins be forgiven thee,\" seems to imply that the man may have been sinful but evidently was repentant, and the Lord was merciful.\n\nNext, we find Jesus at the seaside. At this place, he called Matthew to be one of the Twelve. Although a despised tax collector, Jesus knew Matthew's ability. He was a great student of the Jewish scripture. In the book he later wrote, he quoted copiously from the prophets. It is said that every quotation from the Jewish scripture in the New Testament is found in the Book of Matthew. Jesus knew the true worth of souls.\n\nJesus here taught another of his immortal lessons, soon after Matthew became one of the Twelve. Some of John the Baptist's disciples came to the Master, claiming that he was not strict enough in observing the law. The disciples of Jesus were not fasting enough; they were dining with publicans and sinners; they were following the pursuits of life in a new way. To the feast Matthew had given at the time of his conversion and call to the ministry, some of the \"publicans and sinners\" had been invited. Then came the Savior's lesson: They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance (Mark 2:17). Even to this day, how true the doctrine! The spiritually sick need our help. The underprivileged child, the boys and girls who come from broken homes, and all who have strayed from the fold, call for someone who will minister to them in the spirit of the Great Physician.\n\nWill the spiritual teachers of the Church find a way to help the straying souls? Jesus worked with that class. Will we?\n\nThe Lord knew the scriptures well, but he constantly offended the Jews by drawing his lessons from life rather than going to the cold letter of the law. One day, as he stood by the Sea of Galilee, a great crowd came to hear him. He improvised a pulpit by getting into a boat and having Simon move the boat a short distance from the shore. He delivered one of his powerful addresses. Drawing from the environment with which they were familiar, as all good teachers do, he said to his disciples: \"Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men\" (Mark 1:17). Most of them had been fishermen; they were now to fish for souls who could be shown the way to eternal life.\n\nQuestions and Suggestions for Discussion\n\n1. In what way does the conversation between Jesus and the woman at Jacob's well show that he was no respecter of persons and that his teachings are for all people? The incident should be carefully studied. How was the Lord's power of discernment shown?\n\n2. Jesus, of course, possessed the power to heal the sick. Relate an incident showing that this power was exercised even when the sick person was not present.\n\n3. Give some of the evidence showing that Jesus always subjected himself to the wishes of his Father.\n\n4. Relate the incident of the calling of Matthew to the ministry. Show that the Lord came to call sinners to repentance.\n63 Visiting Teachers' Messages�Our Pioneer Heritage Lesson 7�Building Activities President Amy Brown Lyman For Tuesday, April 6, 1948 Objective: To recognize the high standards in the building activities of the pioneers, which act as a stimulus for us today.\n\nIn looking back over Utah's first century, and in evaluating the accomplishments of the Latter-day Saints, their building activities loom large. Not only the number and variety of Latter-day Saint buildings is surprising, but also the style of architecture used, and the stability maintained. It has been the practice of Latter-day Saints to build well. In Nauvoo substantial buildings had been erected by them including the beautiful temple which was destroyed by fire and tornado and even before that time, a temple had been built by them in Kirtland, which is still standing. Naturally, the most famous Latter-day Saint buildings are located in Salt Lake City—the Temple, Tabernacle, and the Assembly Hall, most of the construction of which was done during the first half of the first century of the Church.\n\nTwo other attractive old structures are the Lion House and the Beehive House, and near them is the Eagle Gate, all greatly admired by traveling artists and architects. The old Salt Lake Theater, the Social Hall, and the Gardo House, all now gone, were also noted buildings. Scattered throughout the State are other old and noteworthy buildings, including three temples, located in Logan, Manti, and St. George, and a number of attractive tabernacles such as those found in Logan, Brigham City, Provo, St. George, and Coalville. Four additional temples have been erected, in Hawaii, Canada, Arizona, and Idaho Falls, making eight temples which are in use today. These, with the Kirtland and Nauvoo temples, make ten in all which have been built by the Church. Among the many other new and notable Church buildings are the Church Office Building and the Bishop's Building in Salt Lake City, the Joseph Smith Memorial Building, which stands on the"

    "content": "Bertha Zaugg Perschon\n\nThrough accidents or by long wear, umbrellas become shabby or useless. At the present time it is very expensive to buy a good umbrella that is both attractive looking and will wear well. The homemaker who understands how to cut patterns, and who is familiar with simple sewing, can cover her old umbrella frame for a fraction of the cost of buying a new umbrella. It is, however, necessary to proceed slowly and follow the directions with great care.\n\nMaterials Needed\n1 yard of 39-inch material of your favorite color and texture. Rayon taffeta proves very satisfactory, as it does not split as readily as silk.\nGlue for replacing the cap. If cap is lost, a plastic thimble makes a good substitute.\n2 spools of thread, one for heavy duty hand sewing, and one for machine use.\n\nPreparatory Steps\nSoak the cap off the old umbrella by placing it in very hot water to melt the glue. Remove the cap.\nCarefully remove the old cover—from the umbrella frame, taking particular notice of where, how, and why it is sewed. This is very important, for, in stitching back the new cover to the frame, the same type of stitches must be used in the same places in order to assure a perfect fit.\n\nAfter carefully removing the old cover, all in one piece, unpick one of the panels, being sure not to tear or stretch it. Press this panel smooth and straight.\n\nWaterproofing the Material\nPlace the material to be used as the new cover between two sheets of waxed paper and press with iron on low heat, the temperature for artificial silk or rayon. The applied heat causes the wax to permeate the material, thus making it waterproof. Use new pieces of waxed paper for each area of the material, carefully arranging the sheets so that no spaces of the material will be left without a wax coating.\n\nCutting the Pattern\nLay the pressed panel on a piece of paper and cut a pattern the same size and shape as the original panel, except for one slight difference. You will find that the wide end of the original panel will be slightly curved. Do not cut the curve, but make the pattern straight on this edge. The pattern should be even on both sides when folded on center lengthwise line. Make sure that the pattern is the exact size of the original panel, except for the curve.\n\nLay the yard of 39-inch material flat on the table and cut it in half lengthwise. Remove the selvages and make a 1/2-inch hem on both sides of the lengths of the two pieces. (See Diagram A.)\n\nPlace the pattern at the top of one of the two pieces of hemmed material; with the wide panel end at the right-hand hemline and the point of the triangular-shaped panel toward left-hand hemline. Be sure that the pattern is laid along the straight of the goods. (See Diagram B, in which Page 37  DIAGRAM A CUT IN HALF HERE 1/4 INCH HEM 39 INCHES WIDE DIAGRAM C \"FIRST STITCHING\" ~~ SECOND STITCHING (VERY CLOSE TOGETHER) the straight of the goods is represented by dotted lines.)\n\nCut with pinking shears, beginning at the wide end of the panel and cutting toward the point. Alternate the pattern to the other hemline, and repeat until you have cut out one half of the number of panels needed to completely cover the umbrella. Then repeat the same process with the other half of the material.\n\nSewing the Panels\nLay two of the panels together and baste or pin the seam, beginning DIAGRAM B == a= 1/4 INCH HEM DIAGRAM D DIAGRAM E TOP JOINED SEAM TWO CIRCLES THREE INCHES 'N DIAMETER STITCHES 1/2 INCH FROM THE EDGE FOR MAKING RUFFLES i OF SECOND CIRCLE\n\nSina ne sew from the outside in. Continue adding the panels until all are joined. Then complete the circle by joining the last panel to the first. Fold each seam from right to left and top stitch on the wrong side only, just missing the first sewing. This strengthens the seams and prevents breaking of the stitches. (See Diagram C.)\n\nWhen all of the panels are sewed together, the opening at the top should measure 1/2 inch in diameter.\n\nDo not press at any time except when waterproofing.\nFastening the Cover to the Frame\nCut two circles of material, each three inches in diameter, and cut a 1/4-inch hole in the center of each. (See Diagram D.) Place one of these circles on the top of the umbrella frame.\nPlace the cover on the frame over the top of the small circle. Pin the corners of the cover to the frame by turning back onto the wrong side the corners of the joined panels 1/4 inch and placing a sharp pin through the folded material and the holes in the top of the frame. This holds the cover in place. Continue until all the panels are pinned. Then hand stitch the points of the panels to the tips of the umbrella spokes, in the same manner as the old cover was attached to the frame. (See Diagram E.)\nRun a strong double thread around the top of the cover 1/4 inch from the edge and fasten to the top spoke, hand drawing in any slight fullness which may still be in the heavy fabric around the top of the frame toward the center.\nStitch the underside of the cover to the frame where and how it was stitched before. These stitchings vary with the style and shape of the umbrella.\nTake the second stitch circle which you have already cut out (Diagram D) and make a row of running stitches around the outside, 1/4 inch from the edge, and draw the circle up until it is only 1/2 inch in diameter, forming a double ruffle. Place this over the cover on the tip of the frame and fasten securely.\nCompleting the Process\nFurl the umbrella tip, or the substitute frame, being sure to get all the raw edges under the tip. Leave the umbrella closed until the glue dries, about twenty-four hours.\nMake the braid for holding the spokes together from a scrap of the material, the same size as the old one, using it as a pattern for turning, or, if they are lost, use a snap fastener or their place. Sew the band to one of the spokes on the outside and sew the snap to the band.\nWhen all the steps of the process are completed and the glue in the cap is thoroughly dry, open the umbrella and spray it with a fine spray of cold water from the hose or from the shower. This will shrink any slight fullness which may still be in the cover. Leave the umbrella open while it is drying.\n\nHow to Clean an Umbrella\nAn umbrella may be washed in cold, mild soapsuds. Use a soft brush to remove any spots. Rinse well with cold water. Leave the umbrella open until it is dry.\nThree-Part Story to Begin in February\nTHE first installment of a three-part story \"Windy Hilltop\" by Ezra J. Poulsen, will begin in the February issue of TheIn this story of courage and conflict, the characters are vividly presented in their reaction to a problem of divergent loyalties. The dramatic situations are portrayed against the colorful background of western ranch life.\nMr. Poulsen, a native of Idaho, now residing in Salt Lake City, is well known as a contributor to both local and national publications. He is the author of two collections of verse, Songs for the Toilers and Poems in Varied Keys, and has compiled two anthologies of verse for publication. Readers of Thewill remember with pleasure the poems and prose which Mr. Poulsen has contributed over a period of many years. His three-part story \"The Rock and the River\" appeared in the Magazine in 1944.\n\nSYMPHONY\nBeatrice Rordame Parsons\nSpring was the overture—a moment's pain Of bursting bud, of storm, and rain, The lilting melody of trees and birds, Black earth to hum unvoiced words.\nWith summer's gay and glorious sun, With heat to warm, and crops to run, The fugue grows deep, the rhythms light, For winds to whisper through the night.\nIn winter all the notes are low, From muted violins they flow; The tempo seems about to die, When frost begins, and harsh gales cry.\nIt's but the coda to a lovely strain— Life's symphony will rise again; The Maestro still his baton keeps, This is the pause, the music sleeps.\n\nPage 40\nWhere Trails Run Out\nCHAPTER 12—CONCLUSION"

    "content": "Elizabeth Williamson\n\nIf you are a collector of antiques, you know by past experience what you want and how to go about finding it. If you are a beginner, you are probably a little in doubt as how to go about collecting. The simplest way to begin is to absorb the best information around you. Visit museums and historical societies, study the fine pieces, read the magazines which contain interesting and authentic articles dealing with the households of our ancestors. Libraries, and your friends who collect, will help you. There may be a historical house in or near your city which is famous, and furnished with well-preserved pieces, typical of a particular period. You can carefully observe the pieces of antique furniture exhibited in stores, and you can go to auctions. A good antique will be at home in almost any setting. Whether it is an amusing mustache cup, or a beautiful Hepplewhite console, it can lend charm and distinction to your home. Period chairs are always attractive additions to your home. They can be used in the hallway as extras, and occasional chairs may be added to the living room.\n\nOther possibilities are placing these chairs at desks, in bedrooms, at the piano, in the den, and in the sunroom. Rocking chairs are quaint and most welcome if your kitchen is large. By careful observation you will be able to recognize the good lines and the authentic design of an antique chair, and you will become enthusiastic over the romance and the beauty of historic furniture. Ignore the old upholstery; it can be removed and beautiful new fabrics can be used, which will blend with your color scheme and surroundings. However, try to use the fabric which belongs to the period. Each period of history is marked by certain characteristics of design and construction in furniture, and the patterns reflect the spirit of the times, as well as the ideals and activities of the people.\n\nColonial America, not yet an independent nation, was greatly influenced in its furniture design, as well as in its other customs, by the European mother countries. Nevertheless, the construction of the furniture revealed the simplicity and sturdiness of pioneers and the economic conditions under which they lived. Local woods, such as pine, oak, birch, and maple, were the principal materials, and the upholstery fabrics were, for the most part, homespun materials, although some of the wealthy colonists imported more luxurious fabrics from Europe.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Dutch designs of the eighteenth century followed conservative patterns, using simple and useful construction of native woods and homespun fabrics, but some decorative features of painted birds and flowers were added. During the eighteenth century, also, particularly in that period of national development during and following the Revolutionary War and the establishment of the Constitution as the supreme law of the land, English designers still dominated furniture patterns for well-to-do Americans. Thomas Chippendale, the most famous cabinetmaker of England, who died in 1779, while using some of the substantial designs and expert workmanship of earlier furniture makers, added many variations. Using dark mahogany wood, without and working under both \"Chippendale marked by sumptuously carved and interlaced lattice work in the backs, and many of them with boldly curved legs, intricately carved. This style, exceedingly popular in Europe, was quickly adopted in America.\n\nA contemporary of Chippendale, George Hepplewhite, whose aim was to blend \"elegance and utility\" in his designs, developed a style characterized by light, graceful lines, with painted or inlaid decorations of festoons, wreaths, flowers, and musical instruments, in satinwood and mahogany. Hepplewhite's distinctive chair designs exhibited slight, tapering legs, the spade foot, and the distinguishing feature of the shield back. He is credited with having originated the winged chair. Hepplewhite designs are greatly prized by collectors as they are both rare and very beautiful.\n\nDuncan Phyfe is known as an American cabinetmaker, although he was born in Scotland, and did not come to our country until 1783. His designs have had a profound influence on furniture-making in America, and many details, not actually originated by him, can authentically be attributed to his patterns of workmanship.\n\nCOLLECTING ANTIQUE CHAIRS\n\nThe Salt Lake Tribune\n\nHEPPLEWHITE CHAIRS AND CONSOLE IN ADAMS DESIGN\n\nThe chairs are upholstered in eggshell and rose damask. Note the straight legs of the chairs and the shield-shaped backs.\n\nHe made, principally, chairs, sofas, settees, tables, and sideboards, using solid mahogany, mahogany veneer, satinwood, maple, and rosewood. His first designs were characterized by excellent proportions, graceful curves, often accented by parallel rows of reeding, simple ornaments, well placed and carved with the greatest precision, and decorative motives, such as the lyre, the acanthus or oak leaf, and other graceful arrangements. Later, under the influence of the French Empire styles, he made furniture that was heavy, over-ornamented, and largely characterless.\n\nVictorian styles in furniture came to America during the time of westward expansion, the Civil War, and the development of the United States as a powerful nation of great extent and unlimited resources. Victorian furniture was marked by many and varied influences and much of it was solid, heavy, and ponderous. Elaborate \"over-stuffing\" was introduced during this period.\n\nThe accompanying table outlines some of the principal furniture types and lists some of the favorite materials and designs used in upholstering.\n\nFURNITURE TYPES\n\nFurniture Style: Early American (First settlements to the Revolution) Origin: Influenced by Mother countries Characteristics: Since the people were pioneers in a new land, the workmanship was simple, well-made and serviceable.

Sonne, President of the European Mission Relief Society, contributes the following interesting report, under date of August 14th, 1947:\n\"At the conference of mission presidents held at Malmo, Sweden, July 16th-19th, I had the opportunity to meet all the sisters who have charge of the Relief Societies in the European Mission except Sister Stover, who had returned to Salt Lake City, and Sister Sharp who could not be present. Sister Petersen of Denmark, Sister Toronto of Czechoslovakia, and Sister Wunderlich of the West German Mission, who has not been able to enter Germany yet, had but recently arrived and had not become acquainted with conditions in their respective missions. Sister Sharp of the South African Mission sent a very interesting report of her work, which was read and appreciated.\nNOTES FROM THE FIELD 121\nThe sisters met with the mission presidents in all of their sessions where each gave a report of Relief Society activities following the report of the mission president on conditions in his mission. A separate meeting of the sisters was also held, at which each one reported in regard to her problems and as to her plans for the future.\nFinland\nThe work is just getting started, and the missionaries are giving the lessons to the sisters from the Book of Mormon. Translation into Finnish is a problem at the present time.\nBritish Mission\nThere are forty-two Relief Society organizations in the British Mission. Activity during the war was limited and some discontinued their meetings during the extremely cold weather. Sewing lessons are being substituted slowly in place of fancy work. Home canning is being encouraged.\nCzechoslovakian Mission\nDuring the war the Relief Society met in the homes. Activity was very limited and no definite program was followed. Prospects appear good.\nDanish Mission\nThere are 247 sisters enrolled in the Relief Society in the Danish Mission, of whom 200 attended regularly. A Singing Mothers' group has been organized and gave several selections during the recent conference held in Copenhagen.\nEast German Mission\nThe Relief Society did very little during the war. They are now being organized and are becoming interested in the work. A capable sister has been called on a mission to teach the sisters how to remodel clothing for those who are in urgent need.\nFrench Mission\nThe Relief Society sisters are encouraged to make over old clothing as new purchases are impossible in France. The organizations are functioning well in Belgium, especially in visiting teaching. The sisters have tried valiantly to keep track of their members. Canning has not been encouraged due to a lack of pressure cookers.\nNetherlands Mission\nThe Relief Society organizations were kept alive during the war. For several seasons they studied \"The Way to Perfection.\" It was difficult to introduce current lesson material. The lessons outlined by the General Board are published in the mission paper and are one year behind on account of translation delays. Meetings are held throughout the year, and attendance is constantly increasing. The sisters have made over old clothing and prepared baptismal clothes.\nNorwegian Mission\nWell-qualified women are in charge of the work throughout the mission. There are twelve organizations. District boards have been organized, instead of a mission board which cannot function because of the long distances. Recently the Bergen Branch completed the first quilt made in the Norwegian Mission.\nSwedish Mission\nThere are thirteen organizations in Sweden. The sisters are making baptismal and burial clothes and are also working on layettes. Two clothing drives for Norway and Finland have been conducted. Meetings are held regularly. \"The attendance is good. Lessons are published in the mission paper. The Malmo Branch Relief Society prepared and served the noon meals for the mission presidents' conference. They deserve high praise for the manner in which this work was done.\"\n\nSwiss-Austrian Mission\nThe Relief Society in this mission is in excellent condition. In Austria, the sisters carried on in a most commendable manner during the war. New lesson materials are looked for and will be appreciated. The sisters are enthusiastic and very interested in the work.\n\nIn March, 1947, a successful convention was held in Bern, Switzerland, attended by about 200. Evening entertainments were conducted throughout the mission by the Relief Society organizations to collect funds for an Austrian family whose home had been destroyed by fire.\n\nWest German Mission\nRelief Society meetings were forbidden by the Hitler regime, but the work is being revived as fast as possible.\n\nSouth African Mission\nCooking demonstrations conducted by Sister Sharp have increased attendance at the meetings.

Faith and works have paved the way for her successful career as a splendid teacher of the gospel. With all her Church activities, she has maintained a high degree of efficiency in her home, not permitting anything to mar or divert her from the highest of all callings, that of wife and mother. She has the rare gift of companionship with her husband and children. She manifests at home love, loyalty, gentleness, meekness, patience, and practically all womanly virtues. The Book of Mormon speaks of being born of goodly parents. This great gift was bequeathed to Louise, for surely she has a noble heritage. Her father was Ashley Harper Wallace, youngest son of Patriarch Henty Wallace. Her mother, Claribel Louise Woods, was a granddaughter of Parley P. Pratt.\nOn June 1, 1928, in the Salt Lake Temple she was married to Francis Armstrong Madsen, son of Richard W. Madsen and Mary Armstrong Madsen, and grandson of one of the most prominent early pioneers, Francis Armstrong. Her four lovely children are Francis A. Jr., sixteen, Mary Louise, fourteen, Robert Ashley, twelve, and Richard Harper, right.\nSister Madsen's untiring service fits her into the pattern of service, as expressed by Micah in one of the most exquisite definitions of religion: \"He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?\" (Micah 6:8). Sister Madsen truly tries to exemplify these wonderful virtues in her life.\nAleine Margetts Young (Continued from page 82)\nBrother Young is a capable architect, a kind husband and father, who will give full support and co-operation to Sister Young in her new calling. Together, they have built a beautiful home where love and harmony dwell. They have four splendid children, Richard, who is a missionary in the Central States, Renee, Jane, and Bobby.\n\nSister Young accepts this new position with humility, but her devotion to Relief Society, her many gifts of personality, her experience, and education are qualities that will make her a beloved and useful member of the General Board.\n\n**TASKS Christie Lund Coles**\nI do my simple daily tasks,\nSweep the floor and make the bed.\nReward seems part of every deed,\nAs fragrance part of new-baked bread.\n\n???LESSON\nELDEPARTMENT Theology\n\nThe Life and Ministry of the Savior\nLesson 8 \"Lord of the Sabbath\"\n\"The Chosen Twelve\"\n\nElder Don B. Colton (Reference: Jesus the Christ (Chapters 15 and 16), by Elder James E. Talmage)\n\nFor Tuesday, May 4, 1948\n\nObjective: To show that the Sabbath is distinctively sacred to the people who accept the Lord as their guide. Also, to show that Jesus does have a specific calling in the Priesthood to which he delegates the power to carry on his work in the earth.\n\nAfter the creation of the earth, the Lord himself rested on the day he hallowed and made sacred. It is therefore perfectly logical and reasonable that he would expect his followers to \"keep sacred\" that holy day. Surely, one day in seven is not too much for men to rest, and turn their thoughts to worship and how best to serve their Creator.\n\nThe great powers of Jehovah were impressively shown at Sinai. Israel must not forget the law that was written by the hand of the Lord on that memorable occasion. The preparation was complete to indelibly impress Israel with the necessity of keeping God's law. Next, after the commandments concerning God and the sacredness in which his name should be held, comes the divine injunction: \"Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.\"\n\nDuring Israel's travels in the wilderness, in fact, during the entire exodus, this law was strictly enforced. On the day preceding the Sabbath, they were commanded to gather sufficient manna for the extra day. By nearly all of the prophets, prior to the coming of the Messiah, either the desecration of the Sabbath was forcefully condemned, or the blessings promised those who would keep it were reiterated with inspired fervor. However, there was no requirement that the \"keeping of the Sabbath\" was to be a burden to the people. It was to be a day of rest, a day of spiritual enjoyment, a day when people might come together in love and fellowship and pay respect and homage to their Maker. Excessive fasting was not required. In short, it was to be a sweet, holy day during which man and beast were to rest. Man was to worship and experience the peace and joy of being near to God.\n\nHow much we do need such a day now!\n\nAnciently, every seven years the Lord also prescribed a year of rest. Even the land was to rest every seventh year; its fertility was to be increased. Every fifty years, or seven times seven years, there was to be a year of jubilee. It was to be a year of rest. Debts were to be forgiven and general relief extended to all people in distress. All of these periods of rest were for the benefit and blessing of the people.\n\nEzekiel, a pastor to homeless exiles, stated that the Sabbath was a \"covenant between the Lord and the people of Israel.\" He earnestly rebuked those who violated this day of rest and worship. Long before the coming of Christ, the rabbis and priests had led the people away from the true spirit of the Sabbath. They had created rules, and given them the sanctity of law, which completely changed the meaning and purpose of the Sabbath. Sabbath requirements became a burden, and the Savior, at his coming, found a distorted, unjust set of rules that were obnoxious and unworkable.\n\nJesus soon found himself confronted with charges of Sabbath-breaking. In the fifth chapter of John is related one instance which will illustrate the absurdity of rabbinical formalism. There was a certain spring near one of the markets in Jerusalem, the waters of which were reported to possess curative values. Many afflicted people bathed there.\n\nCHRIST AND THE FISHERMEN \nThe waters would well up and then recede. There was a tradition that \"whosoever first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had\" (John 5:4).\n\nOne Sabbath day, Jesus visited this pool, or spring. He saw there, a man who had been afflicted for thirty-eight years. The poor fellow was so helpless that he could not get into the water first. Someone else always crowded in ahead of him. When Jesus saw the situation, he said to the invalid: \"Wilt thou be made whole?\" The answer, of course, was in the affirmative. The Master spoke to him: \"Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.\" The Great Healer had made the cripple well. No doubt, his great heart was full of pity when he saw the unequal struggle, and mercy was extended.\n\nLater, when Christ saw the man in the temple, he said unto him: \"Behold, thou art made whole; sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.\" Probably the man's sickness was the result of his own transgression. This miracle was performed on the Sabbath day. The Jews were so bitter that they sought to put him to death because, they claimed, he had violated the Sabbath. Think of the inconsistency! He had only spoken, but the afflicted man had carried his bed into his own house. They claimed Jesus had caused the man to break the Sabbath.\n\nJesus boldly met his accusers. He said: \"My Father worketh hithereto and I work.\" The Jews protested that Jesus sought to make himself equal with God. The Savior, in effect, admitted the charge. In the language of Paul: \"Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God.\" He then proceeded to explain the powers which had been given him of the Father. As the Father had power to raise the dead, so would the Son have such powers. Speaking of those powers, he said: Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation (John 5:28-29).\n\nHe did proclaim himself the literal son of God and was Lord of the Sabbath day. Had written concerning J\n\nBut they could not, or would not, believe. If they would not believe the Lord's words, who had ordained the Sabbath was the same as the One now speaking to them.\n\nThe disciples of were also accused of violating the Sabbath day, but the Lord defended them with equal boldness.\n\nThe Chosen Twelve\nIn the text we are studying, considerable time and space are devoted to a description of each of the Twelve Apostles, whom Jesus called and ordained.\n\nTo learn of them, one should read Chapter 16 of Jesus the Christ. Our discussion will be more general. It is specifically stated by Jesus: \"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you\" (John 15:16). Paul, who later became one of the Twelve, speaking of the callings in the Priesthood, said: \"And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron\" (Heb. 5:4). The Lord revealed to Moses, the head of his work, that Aaron was to be called into the service (Ex. 4:14-16, also Ex. 28:1).\n\nThe scriptures plainly teach that the apostleship is the Priesthood of Presidency in the Church which the Lord established. A few quotations will suffice to show this:\nAnd God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues (I Cor. 12:28).\nAnd are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the Lord and his apostles (Eph. 2:20).\nEph. 2:15, 21, and 22 should also be read. The Church is likened unto a building. The foundation is built upon the Lord and his apostles. If we study carefully Ephesians 4:8-14, we learn of the work of these apostles and that they are to remain in the Church, wherever established, \"for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God.\n\nThose who teach that apostles are no longer necessary should read carefully these scriptures. The apostles constitute the very foundation of the edifice of Christ's Church.\nThe men called to these high and sacred positions by the Savior were men whom he had already demonstrated their faithfulness. They believed in him and had, before they were ordained, openly testified that he was the Son of God. They were men who later forsook all and followed the head of the Church wherever he sent them. They were his servants: \"they were not chosen from the ranks of the rabbis and the scribes. They were not men learned in the Jewish laws and rabbinical formalism. They were chosen by the Master, he ordained them. They were promised the gift of the Holy Ghost.\n\nBut the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you (John 14:26).\nGod was to reveal things unto them. The testimony that Jesus is the Christ is a revelation: \" . . . no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost\" (I Cor. 12:3).\n\nThe Lord gave to the apostles of his Church the \"keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven\" (Matt. 16:19). Do apostles still hold, or have, those keys? We solemnly affirm that the apostles in the true Church do have those keys and exercise them in the places which God has ordained for their use. The Lord did not give to his servants useless keys. He did not give keys which were to be used only in one period of the world's history. God is unchangeable. The Church he established while he lived upon the earth has been re-established in this, our day. The same keys, blessings and privileges enjoyed anciently are enjoyed by the faithful in this day. Christ's Church is upon the earth. If anyone seeks for it, he can find it.\nQuestions and Suggestions for Discussion\n1. Why is it logical to believe that the Lord expects his followers to observe a sacred Sabbath? What is the true spirit of the Sabbath? Discuss its reasonableness.\n2. In what way had the rabbis and Jewish priests completely changed the true spirit of the Sabbath? Tell of the miracle performed on the Sabbath day at the pool near the market place.\n3. In what way did Jesus admit his Godship?\n4. To what council did Jesus delegate the authority to carry on the work of the ministry? Give Bible quotations to show that the apostleship is the authority of presidency in the Church of Christ.\n\nVisiting Teachers' Messages\nOur Pioneer Heritage Lesson 8 Beautification President Amy Brown Lyman\nFor Tuesday, May 4, 1948\nObjective: To become acquainted with pioneer plans of beautification of homes, churches, and communities, in order to appreciate fully the realization of those plans a century later.\n\nAlmost as soon as a Camp was established in the Valley, the pioneers began to plan their city, which was to be the center of the new empire eventually its capital. Modeled after the designs and ideas of Joseph Smith for the \"City of Zion,\" it was to be laid out as a perfect square, divided into ten-acre blocks with streets eight rods wide and sidewalks twenty feet wide, and to contain a park for beautifying and recreational purposes. It was to be surrounded by fields and farms, and each family was to be given a city lot of approximately one acre, and a field varying in size according to the needs and the ability of the family to care for it. Such was the original plan for Salt Lake City, which in time was partially carried out, and which would today, after one hundred years, be hard to improve upon. The city was to be a thing of beauty, set in the heart of a desert, and such it has proved to be.\n\nThis plan also served as a pattern for the villages and towns subsequently established in the intermountain region. Building for beautification as well as for permanency, the pioneers adopted styles of architecture and fine interior wood finishings in their public buildings which have been and still are the admiration of students of art and architecture; and in their private homes, many of which were humble and simple, they strove also for dignity and harmony in design. Coming, as many of them did, from old communities in Europe where they had been familiar with fine buildings and gardens, they were influenced by overseas' architecture and landscaping. Others, coming from older and more developed communities in the United States, brought with them ideas and ideals in construction and design which they naturally adopted.\n\nBrigham Young, himself a carpenter, cabinetmaker, and builder, with the assistance of such architects as Truman O. Angell and others, spared no pains in making and caring out, as far as possible, extensive plans for a building and a beautification program. Although handicapped in the beginning by lack of building materials and by irrigation problems, they set about at once to overcome these handicaps.\n\nIn a few years, they were sawing timber, making adobes and bricks and cutting stone, which enabled them to erect substantial, permanent buildings; and, through the successful system of irrigation that they established, they were able to beautify the surroundings of their buildings. Handcraft work, for both men and women, was encouraged, with the result that many churches and public buildings, and homes as well, could boast of wood-carved cornices, panels, and mantels. Exquisite, handmade furniture, which has not since been surpassed in beauty, adorned many homes. Some of the specimens of exquisite wood carvings are to be found in the Salt Lake Temple, the Beehive House, and in the moldings of the cornice around the Salt Lake Tabernacle; also in the St. George Tabernacle, the St. George, and Manti Temples. The stairway in the Manti Temple shows excellent workmanship. The Assembly Hall on Temple Square in Salt Lake City is notable for its unexcelled masonry. Women contributed their part of ideas and the work of their hands in helping to improve the interior of buildings and yards. They saw to it that the inside walls of churches, schoolhouses, and homes were whitewashed; and that the church aisles were carpeted with home-woven strips. The old parlors and bedrooms in the homes were covered with artistically striped, homemade carpets, and braided rugs adorned the scoured kitchen floors. They planted shrubs and flowers about the homes, such as hollyhocks, pinks, daisies, sweet william, and herbs from seeds which, in the beginning, they had carried with them across the plains. These they watered mostly by buckets and hand sprinklers. Nothing could be lovelier than were those rows of old-fashioned flowers which lined the walks, and the flower beds which hugged the houses and centered the yards. 'There were few homes which could not boast of a neat flower garden.\n\nA person with an eye to beauty will not fail today to be impressed with the setting and architectural stateliness of many of the pioneer buildings erected a century ago; and with streets and avenues, laid out at the same time, many of which provide four-lane highways. Suggestions for Discussion Some of the teachers might contribute to the discussion by reporting examples of community beautification with which they are familiar and by suggesting future projects.\n\n LESSON DEPARTMENT 133\n\nWork Meeting Sewing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting)\nLesson 7 Plackets and Zippers Jean Ridges Jennings\nReference: The Complete Book of Sewing, Chapter XVIII, pp. 122-123, 133, 138\n\nFor Tuesday, April 13, 1948\n\nTHOUGH there are various types of plackets and zipper closings for garments, they all serve the same purpose. Their function is to allow plenty of room to easily put clothing on and off and still have it fit well. A placket should, therefore, be made to fit as smoothly as a seam if one hopes to retain the perfect fit of one's dress.\n\nWe will first consider the zipper closing. Many women find that they encounter difficulty putting in zippers, so that the garment will fit just as they want it and the seam will be perfectly flat and smooth with no bulging or puckering at the bottom of the opening. Frequently, after the zipper is sewed in, one finds that the waistline is either too loose or too tight. To avoid this distressing result care must be taken to properly fit the garment and mark the opening accurately so there is no guesswork when sewing the zipper in.\n\nPut the dress or skirt on, right side out, and pin the seam in place, folding the front edge under so that it is closed exactly as you would like it to be when wearing it. Place pins at right angles to the seam and about one half inch apart. When this is carefully done, and the side seam is absolutely smooth and straight, mark with chalk or a basting thread on both front and back of the garment the exact spot where the two edges of the seam meet. The pins can be removed and there is left an accurate line to follow in finishing the closing.\n\nIf the seam allowance is not wide enough to completely cover the metal of the zipper, an extension of seam tape or material will need to be added. Using the markings as a guide, temporarily sew up the opening using the largest stitch on the sewing machine or a small running hand stitch, being careful to have the waistline seam meet accurately. The zipper is now sewed into the closed seam by first making a fold 1/2 inch wide in the back half of the seam, keeping the right side of the material up. Baste and stitch this as close as possible to the metal of the zipper. This is done with the dress wrong side out.\n\nNext turn the garment right side out and baste the front edge of the seam down just beyond the metal of the zipper, being careful not to pull the edge of the seam over. Stitch on the machine in a straight line ending with a diagonal to the seam at top and bottom. The temporary stitching may now be removed and the closing is finished.\n\nBy using this method the seam can be made to be perfectly flat with the zipper completely covered and only one stitching showing.\n\nZippers are not always the best closing for all types of garments. A regulation placket can be made in dresses and skirts and held closed with snaps or hooks and eyes. In this case the preliminary fitting is done in the same manner as for zippers. For light weight or sheer materials, for lingerie, for children's clothing, and straight gathered skirts, a continuous placket is used. For sleeve and neck openings where there is no seam, a faced placket is used. Hemmed plackets are also common for children's clothes and underwear.\n\nSpace does not permit detailed instructions for all of these plackets but methods can be found by referring to the textbook listed at the beginning of this lesson, the Butterick Dressmaking Book, or The Singer Dressmaking Guide.\n\nWork Meeting Sewing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting)\nLesson 8 Make-Overs Jean Ridges Jennings\nReference: The Complete Book of Sewing, Chapter XXXIII\n\nFor Tuesday, May 11, 1948\n\nREMODELING, altering, or making-over clothes is a very important part of wardrobe planning in any family with a limited income. Quite frequently clothes become shabby or out of style, or one grows tired of wearing them before they are worn out. Often this is the case when there is still a great deal of good to be found in them. Sometimes they are worn too much for further service to one member of a family but can be used profitably for some other person. And sometimes one can even utilize the usable parts of garments for purposes other than making clothing.\n\nThe field of remodeling and re-using clothing is one of endless possibilities and offers a challenge to everyone.\n\nWe all of us want to get as much good as we can out of things we have on hand so must make an effort to put clothes to the best possible use. Even though garments are worn and can only be used for some make-over project, they should be thoughtfully and carefully made. One must strive to conceal the original identity of the garment and certainly to avoid giving the remade article a made-over look. Often when fabrics are shabby and shiny from wear, they can be turned and re-made wrong side out. This is especially true of woolens and materials with a nap that wears off. One of the commonest and easiest ways to make new clothes from old is to combine two worn articles to make a new one or to combine new material with the old to change the style, for trimming, or to supply enough material to complete the garment. Care and good judgment must be used in utilizing new  LESSON DEPARTMENT material to refinish an old dress or suit. One must make sure that the fresh, new cloth does not make the old look older and more shabby. Sometimes one's effort to utilize old clothes can lead to unhappy consequences financially. It should always be kept in mind that the cost of new material used in making over old clothes must not be so great that it outweighs the value to the wearer of the completed garment. Expenditures for new fabrics to be combined with old ones should be kept as low as possible. Otherwise, we may find to our sorrow that it would have been better to spend a little more and make a whole new garment. The time involved in these projects should also be carefully considered. Anything we undertake to do ought to be worth the effort 135 spent. So once again careful thought should be given to the project beforehand and to help decide whether or not the finished article will justify our work. Keeping these thoughts in mind, make a survey of clothing on hand with a view to using everything that can be re-made successfully. The lessons for the coming year will take up at length the possibilities to be found in old clothes with specific suggestions for making over all types of clothing into all manner of new articles. Our aim, then, will be to help every homemaker get the most good from clothes on hand, whether they be dad's, mother's, big or little brother's or sister's. We'll have suggestions for using old coats, suits, party dresses, lingerie, or whatever is available. Our motto from now on is, \"Make the most of what you have.\"\n\nLiterature\nLiterature of the Doctrine and Covenants Lesson 8 Appreciation Values in Doctrine and Covenants Reading Elder H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, May 18, 1948 Objective: To appreciate the Doctrine and Covenants as literature through a discussion of values to be received from the Lord's word, THROUGHOUT the study of the Doctrine and Covenants this year, the literary values of this modern scripture have been stressed. It has been our purpose to appreciate the beauty, as well as the truth, of the Lord's word in our day. In all studies of literature there is need at the end of a course to enjoy, to appreciate, to remember. This can well be done in what we may call a literary recital of the choice passages from the Doctrine and Covenants studied during our lessons. In the main, these passages have divided themselves into longer and shorter readings. The longer ones may be illustrated by the following: Behold, there are many called, but few are chosen. And why are they not chosen? Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and aspire to the honors of men, that they do not learn this one lesson that the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principle of righteousness. That they may be conferred upon us, it is true, but when we undertake to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens withdraw themselves; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it is withdrawn, Amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man. Behold, ere he is aware, he is left unto himself, to kick against the pricks, to persecute the saints, and to fight against God. We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion. Hence many are called, but few are chosen. No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned; By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy; that he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of death. Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distill upon thy soul as the dews from heaven. The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever (121:34-46). Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the voice of him who dwells on high, and whose eyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken ye people from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together. For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated. And the rebellious shall be pierced with much sorrow; for their iniquities shall be spoken upon the housetops, and their secret acts shall be revealed. And the voice of warming shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days. And they shall go forth and none shall stay them, for I the Lord have commanded them (1:1-5). Therefore, verily I say unto you, my friends, call your solemn assembly, as I have commanded you.\n\nAnd as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith. Organize yourselves; prepare every needful thing; and establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God; that your incomings may be in the name of the Lord; that your outgoings may be in the name of the Lord; that all your salutations may be in the name of the Lord, with uplifted hands unto the Most High. Therefore, cease from all your light speeches, from all laughter, from all your lustful desires, from all your pride and light-mindedness, and from all your wicked doings. Appoint among yourselves a teacher, and let not all be spokesmen at once; but let one speak at a time and let all listen unto his sayings, that when all have spoken that all may be edified of all, and that every man may have an equal privilege. See that ye love one another; cease to be covetous; learn to impart one to another as the gospel requires. Cease to be idle; cease to be unclean; cease to find fault one with another; cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated (88:117- 124). Wherefore, fear not even unto death; for in this world your joy is not full, but in me your joy is full. Therefore, care not for the body, neither the life of the body; but care for the soul, and for the life of the soul. And seek the face of the Lord always, that in patience ye may possess your souls, and ye shall have eternal life.  LESSON DEPARTMENT When men are called unto mine everlasting gospel, and covenant with an everlasting covenant, they are accounted as the salt of the earth and the savor of men; they are called to be the savor of men; therefore, if that salt of the earth lose its savor, behold, it is thenceforth good for nothing only to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men (101:36-40). A great and marvelous work is about to come forth unto the children of men. Behold, I am God; give heed unto my word, which is quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged sword, to the dividing asunder of both joints and marrow; therefore give heed unto my words. Behold, the field is white already to harvest; therefore, whoso desireth to reap, let him thrust in his sickle with his might, and reap while the day lasts, that he may treasure up for his soul everlasting salvation in the kingdom of God. Yea, whosoever will thrust in his sickle and reap, the same is called of God. Therefore, if you will ask of me you shall receive; if you will knock it shall be opened unto you. Now, as you have asked, behold, I say unto you keep my commandments, and seek to bring forth and establish the cause of Zion; Seek not for riches but for wisdom, and behold, the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto you, and then shall you be made rich. Behold, he that hath eternal life is rich (6:1-7). He that ascended up on high, as also he descended below all things, in that he comprehended all things, that he might be in all and through all things, the light of truth; which truth shineth. This is the light of Christ. As also he is in the sun, and the light of the sun, and the power thereof by which it was made. As also he is in the moon, and is the light of the moon, and the power thereof by which it was made; as also the light of the stars and the power thereof by which they were made; And the earth also, and the power thereof, even the earth upon which you stand. And the Light which shineth, which giveth you light, is through him who enlighteneth your eyes, which is the same light that quickeneth your understandings; which light proceedeth forth from the presence of God to fill the immensity of space The light which is in all things, which giveth life to all things, which is the law by which all things are governed, even the power of God who sitteth upon his throne, who is in the bosom of eternity, who is in the midst of all things (88:6-13). For the shorter selections these may be cited: Treasure up in your minds continually the words of life (84:85). For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads (25:12). Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness; For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in no wise lose their reward (58:27-28). For this is a day of warning, and not a day of many words. For I, the Lord, am not to be mocked in the last days (63:58). 1, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise (82:10). Yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning even by study and also by faith (88:118). And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones; and shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasure; and shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint. And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them. Amen (89:18-21). For man is spirit. The elements are eternal, and spirit and element inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy; and when separated, man cannot receive a fulness of joy. The elements are the tabernacle of God; yea, man is the tabernacle of God, even temples; and whatsoever temple is defiled, God shall destroy that temple. The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth (93: 33-36). 138 Activities and Readings for Appreciation For the hour let the recital take two forms of activity. First, allow time for a reading and discussion of the truth and beauty to be found in the longer passages, references for more of which may be found below. Second, call upon each class member to recite from memory one or two shorter passages. There need not be any comment or discussion for such readings.\n\nIt is enough to know that the words of the Lord have been remembered. Additional readings from the Doctrine and Covenants: 63:49-54; 4324-30; 84:81-85; 128:19-25; 110:1-6; 121:1-6; 27:15-18; 84:99-102; 133:36-64; 122.\n\nHome Training Lesson 7 Reverence Elder Joseph Jacobs\nFor Tuesday, May 25, 1948\n\nObjective: Beginning of time.\n\nVERENCE is profound respect or honor for a holy being or place or an exalted thing. One of the innate characteristics of human nature is that of reverence and respect for divine power—a power greater than that of man. There is something within the breast of every human being which instinctively reaches up for contact with his Maker, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.\" This is the first and great commandment (Matt. 22:37-38). This is the true spirit of reverence.\n\nFrom a quotation in the Doctrine and Covenants we learn that immortal as well as mortal beings give reverence and devotion to Deity: \"And thus we saw the glory of the celestial, which excels in all things where God, even the Father, reigns upon his throne forever and ever; before whose throne all things bow in humble reverence and give him glory forever and ever\" (76:92-93).\n\nHow Should We Treat the Name of the Lord?\nEven the name of the Lord is to be treated with great reverence. \"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain\" (Exodus 20:7). From Clark's Commentary we read: This precept not only forbids all false oaths, but all swearing where the name of God is used, or where he is appealed to as a witness of the truth. It also necessarily forbids all light and irreverent mention of God, or any of his attributes; and we may safely add to all these, that every prayer, ejaculation, etc., that is not accompanied with deep reverence and the genuine spirit of piety, is here condemned also. Whatever the person himself may think or hope, however he may plead in his own behalf, and say he intends no evil, etc.; if he in any of the above ways, or in any other way, takes the name of God in vain, God will not hold him guiltless; he will account him guilty and punish him for it.\n\nJesus said, as recorded in Matthew 5:34-37:\n\"But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: Nor by the earth, for it is his footstool: Neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.\"\n\nThe name of Deity is so sacred that it should not be used frequently. This is the reason the name of the higher Priesthood was changed. There are in the church two priest-hoods, namely, the Melchizedek and Aaronic, including the Levitical Priesthood. Why the first is called the Melchizedek Priesthood is because Melchizedek was such a great high priest. Before his day it was called the Holy Priesthood, after the order of the Son of God. But out of respect or reverence to the name of the Supreme Being, to avoid the too frequent repetition of his name, they, the church, in ancient days, called that Priesthood after Melchizedek, or the Melchizedek Priesthood (D&C 107:1-4).\n\nHow Should We Revere Sacred Places?\nReverence for sacred places has been recognized from early Bible days. We read in Genesis:\n\"And Jacob went out from Beersheba and went toward Haran. And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep. And he dreamed, and behold, a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven; and behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it. And, behold, the Lord stood above it, and said, I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. . . . And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the Lord is in this place; and I knew it not. And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! This is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had set for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it. . . . And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, if God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the Lord be my God: And this stone which I have set for a pillar shall be God's house\" (Gen. 28:10-22).\n\nThe story of Moses and the burning bush also depicts reverence for a sacred place:\n\"Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian; and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, a bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I. And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground\" (Exodus 3:1-5).\n\nIt is likely that from this occurrence the nations of the East have come to perform their religious rites barefooted. The Greeks did so in ancient times and some sects, including the Mohammedans, still observe this custom.\n\nTourists visiting in the Near East who wish to go into a Mohammedan mosque today may do so provided they remove their shoes, or they may be furnished with slippers which have been previously blessed, to slip over their own shoes, thus preventing any pollution of sacred ground. The temple of Solomon was regarded as the most sacred edifice in all of Israel. Even while it was being built every precaution was taken to keep it so. Note the following passage: And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither; so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building (I Kings 6:7). We read about the Court of the Gentiles in the temple of Herod, which indicates that gentiles were permitted to enter only a portion of the temple area. The Holy of Holies was the most sacred part of the temple into which the high priest was permitted to enter. An incident recorded in II Samuel shows in what reverence the Ark of the Covenant was held: And when they came to Nachon's threshing floor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it. And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God (6:6-7). An incident which demonstrates the feeling of Jesus toward practices carried on in Herod's temple which were contrary to the sacred character of the temple, is recorded in Matthew 21:12-13: And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves, and said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves. How Should We Regard Our Temples Today? Just as in ancient times, so in our day, the dedicating and sanctifying of holy temples are most carefully observed. Note the following excerpts taken from the dedicatory prayer of the Kirtland Temple, given to the Prophet Joseph Smith by revelation: And now we ask thee, Holy Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of thy bosom, in whose name alone salvation can be administered to the children of men, we ask thee, O Lord, to accept of this house, the workmanship of the hands of us, thy servants, which thou didst command us to build. For thou knowest that we have done this work through great tribulation; and out of our poverty we have given of our substance to build a house to thy name, that the Son of Man might have a place to manifest himself to his people. That thy glory may rest down upon thy people, and upon this thy house, which we now dedicate to thee, that it may be sanctified and consecrated to be holy, and that thy holy presence may be continually in this house; And that all people who shall enter upon the threshold of the Lord's house may feel thy power, and feel constrained to acknowledge that thou hast sanctified it, and that it is thy house, a place of thy holiness. And that this house may be a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of glory and of God, even thy house; that all the incomings of thy people, into this house, may be in the name of the Lord; that all their outgoings from this house may be in the name of the Lord; And that all their salutations may be in the name of the Lord, with holy hands, uplifted to the Most High; and that no unclean thing shall be permitted to come into thy house to pollute it. We ask thee, Holy Father, to establish the people that shall worship, and honorably hold a name and standing in this thy house, to all generations and for eternity; that no weapon formed against them shall prosper; that he who diggeth a pit for them shall fall into the same himself; that no combination of wickedness shall have power to rise up and prevail over thy people upon whom thy name shall be put in this house; and if any people shall rise against this people, that thine anger be kindled against them; and if they shall smite this people thou wilt smite them; thou wilt fight for thy people as thou didst in the day of battle, that they may be delivered from the hands of all their enemies. O hear, O hear, O hear us, O Lord! And answer these petitions, and accept the dedication of this house unto thee, the work of our hands, which we have built unto thy name; and also this church, to put upon it thy name. And help us by the power of thy Spirit, that we may mingle our voices with those bright, shining seraphs around thy throne, with acclamations of praise, singing Hosanna to God and the Lamb! And let these, thine anointed ones, be clothed with salvation, and thy saints shout aloud for joy. Amen, and Amen (D&C 109:4 ff.). From the dedicatory prayer of the Salt Lake Temple, given by President Wilford Woodruff, we read: O Lord, we regard with intense and indescribable feelings the completion of this sacred house. Deign to accept this the fourth temple which Thy covenant children have been assisted by Thee in erecting in these mountains.... We come before Thee with joy and thanksgiving, with spirits jubilant and hearts filled with praise, that Thou hast permitted us to see this day for which, during these forty years, we have hoped, and toiled, and prayed, when we can dedicate unto Thee this house which we have built to Thy most glorious name. One year ago we set the capstone with shouts of Hosanna to God and the Lamb. And today we Dedicate the whole unto Thee, with all that pertains unto it that it may be holy in Thy sight; that it may be a house of prayer, a house of praise and of worship; that Thy glory may rest upon it; that Thy holy presence may be continually in it. These, and numerous other quotations which could be cited, show that various places and buildings have been pronounced sacred and due reverence for them is enjoined.\n\nROEBUCK AND CO.\nJanuary\n\nWHITE GOODS SALE\nIt's the season for savings at Sears.

    "content": "\"Seek Ye First the Kingdom of God\" Edith S. Elliott Member, Relief Society General Board (Address Delivered at the Annual Relief Society General Conference, October 2, 1947) SINCE the beginning of time man has had the opportunity to be guided in his conduct in thought and action by our Heavenly Father. \"God created man in his own image. In the image of God created he him, male and female created he them.\" The mere fact that man is a product of God's creation assures us that he had an interest in the achievement or he would not have gone to all the necessary work for the ultimate accomplishment. With the creation of man our Heavenly Father's interest in his well-being remained ever-constant, as witnessed in the holy scriptures and the revelations given for us in our day. Because of his knowledge of universal and eternal laws, he has been anxious for his earthly children to reap the rewards gained by knowledge of and obedience to them. These laws function with undisturbed accuracy. Like temporal laws when, if not kept, punishment and regret follow. Our Heavenly Father wants us to be happy and enjoy life in its fullness. He has told us that \"man is that he might have joy.\" In order to experience the joy and happiness in store for us, the Savior explained the pattern. For us to follow in chapters 5, 6, and 7 of the gospel of St. Matthew. There is a repetition in Luke, part of which I would like to quote from chapter 12, verses 22 to 32: And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on. The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment. Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls? And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit? If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest? A Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. If then God so clothe the grass, which is today in the field, and tomorrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith? And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind..; For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things. But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.; Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. Page 75 WHEN the gospel was restored in its fullness through the Prophet Joseph Smith, it returned unchanged. All of the laws, commandments, and penalties remain the same. We are plainly told in a revelation recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants that \"there is a law irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of the world, upon which all blessings are predicated; and when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.\" This quotation is a reminder of what we must do to gain salvation. The early saints who accepted the message of the latter-day Prophet and sought first the kingdom of God saw a literal fulfillment of the promise, \"All these things shall be added unto you.\" When they faced the wilderness, no one could say, \"O ye of little faith,\" because it was their faith in and love of God that sustained them through the desert and, later, the mountains, when they sought peace in a forbidding wasteland. Here they sought first the kingdom of God and during these past ten decades all these things have been added unto them. Let us think back over some of \"these things\" of the past one hundred years. This year 1947 is the Centennial year for the settlement of Utah. All members of the Church, as well as Utah's citizenry, have taken pride in recalling the unbelievable attainments made in the State, the Nation, and the world during this period. Since the restoration of the gospel, the whole world has had an outpouring of the favor of our Heavenly Father. It has been as the leaven to the lump. This past century has been the most wonderful that the world has ever known in the fields of medicine, mechanics, inventions, science, and many others. Freedom of speech, of the press, and of religion have reached heights never before known. Exertion of individual freedom has made for more liberal forms of government and democracies. Indeed, the Lord has kept his promise. THE century is over poems, songs, stories, and monuments honor the deeds of the faithful. Will future generations take the seeds from their harvest and produce as abundantly as they?\n\nLet us consider the words of the great Emancipator, which I feel apply here: It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion.... Those of us privileged to witness the dawn of a new century are grateful that we have roots nourished by the fertility of so glorious a past. Let me repeat, we are witnessing the turn of a century. Let us pause for a few moments of stock-taking. We are part way up the hill of progress and can look back on what has gone before, and ahead with faith in the future. Unless we choose to go on, we retrogress. We can make our choice. It will take no effort, vision, or imagination to roll backward. It will take all of these and plenty of them to go forward. According to C. F. Kettering:  \"SEEK YE FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD\" You can send a message around the world in one-seventh of a second, yet it may take years to force a simple idea through a quarter-inch of human skull. Our safety in the future requires us to keep in tune with our Heavenly Father's wishes so that his inspiration can penetrate our beings and move us to noble achievements. Our conduct as individuals is what influences world movements and we could have heaven on earth the minute we all would follow the second great commandment: \"Love thy neighbor as thyself.\" Consider the blessings that can be ours by obedience to the laws decreed in heaven. In 1 Corinthians 3:9 we read: Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. Therefore, \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you.\" FOR SOME APPOINTED REASON Berta Huish Christensen Time will not wait; for some appointed reason, It moves with swift precision and is lost. The rose that bares its beauty beyond season Will find its velvet brittled by the frost. Though we would stay the falling petals, keep The harvest bough that leans on autumn's gate, Or healing moments at the edge of sleep, As solace for our tears, time will not wait. But love will stay through the long years turning, From the first frail bud to the severed leaf, Shielding its flame to a constant burning Through the winds of loss and the snows of grief. And only love will wait with patient breath, Beyond the somber interim of death. Spiritual Security for the Family Leone G. Layton Member, Relief Society General Board [Address Delivered at the Annual Relief Society General Conference, October 2, 1947] Dear Sisters, it is good to partake of the spirit of this great gathering of the sisterhood of the Relief Society. As Relief Society workers, we are all vitally concerned with building the home and family. Latter-day Saint homes should be the happiest in all the world, homes where the spirit of our Father in heaven can abide and his influence direct. Latter-day Saint mothers are all anxious to foster such conditions in their homes, knowing the peace, happiness, and security they bring to the family, for, like Father Lehi, we desire to share with our families the fruits which we have found good. He tells us in the Book of Mormon of his dream-vision of the tree whose fruit \"was desirable to make one happy. And it came to pass that I did go forth and partake of the fruit thereof; and I beheld that it was most sweet, above all that I had ever tasted.... And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceeding great joy; wherefore I began to be desirous that my family should partake of it also....\" We all know the story, how Sariah, Sam, and Nephi came and partook and Laman and Lemuel refused to heed the call of their father; how, in looking for them, he saw the river leading to the tree, the narrow path beside it, and the rod of iron which secured the way for those who clung to it through the mists of darkness. We are fortunate that Nephi was given the interpretation of this dream, for through him we know the sweet fruit was a representation of the \"love of God which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men,\" and that the iron rod represents the word of God. We who are striving to ensure the future security and happiness of our families today, have ready access to the revealed word of the Lord. We have no need to go far to grasp this iron rod of safety, but can, in our own homes, direct our children to the straight and narrow path leading to spiritual security and happiness, and set their feet thereon. We are fortunate, also, in having certain definite markers given us by which we may be sure our course is right, and by which we may judge our progress. I would like to point out a few of these markers which are of special importance to us as wives and mothers. \"Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me\" (John 5:39). As mothers, then, is it not our place to search the scriptures that we may teach them to our children so they will love them and learn to turn to them for guidance in their daily lives? How many great men have told of learning to love the Bible at their mothers' knees! We would none of us think of planning a long journey without consulting the guidebooks and road maps to be sure of the best way to reach our destination. How important it is, then, that we should be conscious at all times of this marker and \"search the scriptures\" that we may learn of our Heavenly Father, our heavenly home, and the way we must take to reach it.... Love him and serve him, the only living and true God.... If we love our Heavenly Father, we will keep the commandments which he has given us, and we will delight to serve him by doing his work here in his earthly kingdom. This marker is of special importance to the homemaker, for it is in the home that patterns of living are set. Little things sometimes influence future attitudes greatly, and a mother who sets aside her desire to see a certain movie or other entertainment that her husband may be free to fill his ward-teaching assignment may be giving her children a lesson in service values that will stay with them throughout their lives.\n\nWhat understanding support comes to a husband from having a wife who honors the Priesthood and its calls. The sons of such a mother will never take the possession of the Priesthood lightly. Surely, if we place first in importance in our homes obedience to authority and a desire to do all we are called upon to do, we shall have marked the way to loving service for our families and set in motion those forces which will bring to them eternal happiness and satisfaction. 79 \"Pray always, lest you enter into temptation....\" As we search the scriptures and serve our Father, we appreciate anew the part prayer plays in dispelling the mist of darkness and helping us cling to the rod. This is the very first marker we are conscious of giving our little ones. How soon they sense the security of a kind Father watching over them as they sleep at night! Then, as they kneel with the family, and, in turn, voice thanksgiving for blessings received and ask for those now needed, a sense of \"belonging,\" of family solidarity, is born within them. Family prayers are, of course, the responsibility of the Priesthood, but I am sure that in homes where the mother sees clearly the many strengthening values of the family praying together, this commandment is never forgotten. I remember one of the brethren saying once, \"We could never forget family prayer in our home. When we came to breakfast we found our chairs all turned away from the table, and, without a word, we were reminded that the first order of the day for our family was to approach our Father in heaven, to thank him for his many blessings and to ask for his protecting care and guidance through the day.\" \"And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day.\" Was there ever a time when mothers of the Church were more concerned with keeping their families \"unspotted from the world\"? Here, in this marker, we are told plainly the way to accomplish our desire. In the 50th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, we read of the Sabbath: And on this day thou shalt do none other thing, only let thy food be prepared with singleness of heart that thy fasting may be perfect, or, in other words, that thy joy may be full.... And inasmuch as ye do these things with thanksgiving, with cheerful hearts and countenances... The fulness of the earth is yours.... I always feel that this revelation is directed to women, especially this part. We manage the homes. We can plan our food for the day with singleness of heart and go with the family to Sunday School and sacrament meeting, and partake of the spirit with them. I know of nothing we can do to bring a more united family spirit than appreciating the privilege of partaking of the sacrament together. I know of no way that we can bring security and happiness to our families more than to set them in the way of obtaining the \"fulness of the earth.\" Sisters, we have our Father's word that \"the herb, and the good things which come of the earth, whether for food or for raiment, or for houses, or for barns, or for orchards, or for gardens, or for vineyards,\" are promised to those who observe his day as he would have them observe it. Read this section often. The promises given herein are explicit. The earthly and spiritual security which we so desire for our families is clearly set forth, and the way pointed out whereby they may be learned. In today's world of uncertainty it seems that, truly, mists of darkness do cover the path ahead, and yet, even as we grope, our hearts are made glad, for we see the light from the fountainhead and testify afresh that by clinging fast to the rod of iron spiritual security for our families will be won and, together with them, we shall partake of the fruit of the tree, which is sweet above all other fruit, which fills our souls with exceeding great joy.   HOME FIRES Grace Sayre Over the hill from the valley I walk at the end of day, Watching the far lights brighten Along the blue canyon way. I see thin home lights gleaming As they prick the darkness through, And I search for one good beacon - That points me home to you; You who keep lights burning, Oh, hope of my heart's desire! I return with a surging gladness In the thought of my own home fire.  Elen Louise Wallace Madsen Called to the General Board Lillie C. Adams Member, General Board of Relief Society \"The glory of God is intelligence, or in other words, light and truth\" ELEN LOUISE WALLACE MADSEN has been conscious of the truthfulness of these words. She has constantly pursued a study of not only the gospel of Jesus Christ, but of literature, the sciences, and history. Since her graduation from the L. D. S., University and attendance at the University of Utah, she has had extension courses in English, literature, history, and law. School. She has, since her marriage, been a member of the Mt. Ogden Stake Primary board, a teacher in Junior Seminary, leader of the Twelfth Ward (Salt Lake City) Gleaner Girls, when her husband was bishop of that ward, Relief Society literature class leader, Emigration Stake Relief Society theology class leader. Persistent, Positive, and perfect Performance in the gospel brings forth goodly fruits. Again she was called to assume a position of responsibility as president of Emigration. She manifests devotion to all her Church duties, realizing that the gospel \"enlighteneth the mind, quickeneth the understanding, openeth the heart, prepareth the hand in the execution of good deeds,\" Truly, she seeks to keep the two. Her faith and fortitude are her strongholds, and she does not allow disaster or defeat to dampen her enthusiasm for the work of the gospel (Continued on Page 126) Page 8] Aleine Margetts Young Called to the General Board Velma N. Simonsen Second Counselor, General Presidency of Relief Society LEINE MARGETTS YOUNG was appointed to the General Board of Relief Society, December 10, 1947. Her appointment brings to the organization a woman of ability and experience, a woman who is admired for her leadership, her good judgment, and her poise, and who is loved for her friendliness, her cheerfulness, her sincerity, and her willingness to work. - Aleine's father, the late Charles P. Margetts, was bishop of the Twenty-seventh Ward, Pioneer Stake, Salt Lake City, for twenty-three years. Her mother, Catherine Rigby Margetts, was a woman of charm and refinement and a wise counselor to her husband. When Aleine was fifteen years old she began teaching in the auxiliary organizations of the Church, and has continued to give constant, faithful service in these organizations.\n\nShe has served as a teacher in Relief Society, Sunday School, the Primary, and Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association, both in a ward capacity and as a member of the stake boards of these organizations. Sister Young is endowed with unusual executive qualities and with the ability to get things done. She is an excellent public speaker and delivers the gospel message with great sincerity. She has been president of Yale Ward Primary, president of Aleine Margetts Young Bonneville Stake Y. W. M. LA., first counselor and president of the Bonneville Ward Relief Society, and for the past year she has served as president of the Bonneville Stake Relief Society. On September 17, 1920, she was married to Lorenzo S. Young, great-grandson of Brigham Young. She spent the next four years with her husband in New York and Philadelphia, where Mr. Young was studying architecture. While in the East they were both active in missionary work, helping the missionaries in holding cottage meetings and street meetings. (Continued on page 126)\n\nRelief Society Building News\n\nSociety sisters everywhere in regard to collecting funds for the erection of the Relief Society building. Those who have actively entered upon the collecting of the Toney express themselves as finding joy and satisfaction in working for this cause. While some ward Relief Societies are uniting to raise in one fund-raising activity their quotas, the great bulk of the money is coming in from individual donations earned by the sisters through that close and dear friend of Relief Society \"Hard Work.\" Many have made and sold bread, cake, pies, flowers, aprons, and other articles for eating and wearing. With the present high prices, it does not take too long to earn $5, each Relief Society member's quota. The General Board feels that in approving the year October 1947 - October 1948 as the time for collecting this great sum of money, wise guidance was given by the General Authorities of the Church. It is a most favorable time. Many wards have held off the fund gathering until after the Christmas season, but expect to bend every effort to collect their quotas in the near future. It is always a satisfaction to complete an assignment, and such an assignment as this one brings joy and blessings to those who aid in its accomplishment. In making their individual contributions, the women of the Church feel that they receive great personal blessings. An example of the joy that comes from this effort is reported by the family of Mrs. Annie Forrester Willardson. This dear sister, a member of Hollywood Ward, Los Angeles Stake, has been almost blind for several years. Recently, at the age of eighty-three, she tried to sign a check for her contribution to the new building. The pen slipped in her hand and part of her name was written off the check. Finally, with the help of her daughter, Della Mortensen, Sister Willardson was able to complete the signature. This was one of the last acts of her life. She passed away very soon after making her contribution. However, she enjoyed the satisfaction of knowing that her name would be included with the thousands of others who are providing for the erection of a building for the women of the Church.\n\nLong a loyal and devoted worker in Relief Society, Mrs. Willardson served in several capacities in ward and stake organizations in her native Sanpete County, Utah, before moving to California. Her large and faithful family are helping to carry forward the work of the Society and they, also, have made their individual contributions.\n\nStakes Which Have Sent In 100% Building Quotas\n\nSouth Idaho Falls Stake Ammon, Idaho Falls Third, Sixth, and Eighth Wards.\nIdaho Falls Stake Idaho Falls Second, Fifth, and Ninth; Iona, and Lincoln Wards.\n\nFirst Stake to Complete Its Building Quota\nSouth Idaho Falls Stake and Ward Relief Society Officers and Members of the Priesthood Front row, left to right: Stake Relief Society officers, Florence W.

How slowly they move, she thought, watching the shadows, like the days how slowly they drag by. The sun's rays lay lightly on the black dress and the thin, almost transparent hands. Mrs. Anderson came out of the house with her accustomed briskness, drawing on her gloves and adjusting her hat with firm, capable fingers.\n\nPage 88\n\nShe was a small woman, completely unlike her tall, dark daughter and her three strapping sons. At the sight of Mary sitting quietly with half-closed eyes, she paused; and her manner became less assured, almost tinged with despair.\n\n\"Mary Dear, are you sure you wouldn't like to come to Relief Society with me this afternoon? You really should start getting out again, you know.\"\n\n\"No, thank you, Mother. I'd rather stay here.\"\n\nThe voice was mechanically polite, the dark eyes did not look up. Mrs. Anderson sighed, hesitated a moment, then hurried on.\n\nAfter the meeting, she waited until the room had cleared and then approached the work director, Sister Jamieson. Sister Jamieson put a big, warm hand on her shoulder and said gently,\n\n\"You look worried, Sister Anderson. Is it Mary?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm at my wits' end, Sister Jamieson. She eats hardly anything, and just sits on the porch all day.\"\n\n\"Let's see—it's been three months since Ken was killed, hasn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Mrs. Anderson shuddered.\n\nTHE ANSWER\n\n\"That horrible accident! It's hard to understand that Ken should go all through the wat without a scratch, only to be snuffed out in a second, by a drunken college boy in a flivver. And the baby!\"\n\nTears stood in her eyes. \"Ken and Mary were so happy about that baby. It would have been born this month, you know.\"\n\n\"I know.\" Mrs. Jamieson patted her arm. \"Sometimes the ways of the Lord are hard to understand.\"\n\n\"That's what worries me most. Mary keeps asking why the Lord didn't take her, when he took away her every reason for living. If she could only find something do you suppose Brother Jamieson could help? She enjoyed teaching under him that year before she was married.\"\n\n\"Yes, he always said any principal would be glad to have Mary as a teacher. Do you think she's strong enough now?\"\n\n\"Doctor Carter says she needs a job.\" Sister Jamieson gathered up her purse and books with a decisive gesture.\n\n\"I'll speak to Tom about it tonight.\"\n\nTHE next afternoon as Mary sat on the porch reading, the quiet was shattered by a joyous cacophony of sound. Public School Number Five, just around the corner, was dismissed for the day. A stream of shouting, bright-sweatered youngsters eddied and swirled down the street.\n\nWith a sigh, Mary closed the book and rose to go into the house.\n\nThey're so terribly alive, she thought, with an ache in her throat.\n\n\"Wait a moment, Mary,\" said a pleasant voice; and she turned to see Mr. Jamieson coming up the walk. 89\n\nA rare smile lighted the girl's somber face.\n\n\"Hello, Mr. Jamieson,\" she greeted him warmly. \"What brings you this way?\"\n\n\"Business, Mary. Shall we go inside, where we can hear ourselves talk? I swear, these youngsters get noisier every year.\"\n\nHe led the way, talking easily.\n\n\"Your third-graders were unusually well-behaved when you taught them that one year. You have a real teaching knack, Mary; it's a pity to waste it.\"\n\nShe started to speak; a tiny frown had replaced the welcoming smile.\n\nBut the principal continued,\n\n\"We need teachers, Mary. You could be a great help to us and it would do you good, too.\"\n\n\"Please, Mr. Jamieson,\" Mary interrupted him. \"I'd really like to help you, but I'm afraid I can't. I just can't.\"\n\n\"Of course, I realize we can't offer you much in the way of salary. It's the intangible rewards that make teaching worthwhile. I wouldn't blame you if you decided to look elsewhere for a job.\"\n\n\"I hadn't thought of getting a job.\" Under the man's direct gaze, she felt a slow flush creeping into her cheeks.\n\n\"After all,\" she said defensively, \"I haven't exactly been in a position to work lately.\"\n\n\"You're well enough to work now,\" said the principal, his bluntness softened only by the kind tone. \"I talked to Doctor Carter just this morning. He says you need to get out and be busy if you don't stop just sitting around this house, you'll turn into a vegetable.\"\n\nThere was no answering spark in Mary's eyes.\n\n\"At least vegetables have a kind of peace,\" she said in a low voice.\n\n\"No. I'm sorry, Mr. Jamieson, but I just don't feel like working. I couldn't do a good job, feeling the way I do.\"\n\nThe principal rose and picked up his hat.\n\n\"All right, Mary, if that's the way you want it.\" He hesitated for a moment, then went on firmly,\n\n\"But let me tell you this. Ken Foster was as straight-thinking a boy as I've ever known. He always said that a man ought to pull his own weight in this world—yes, and a woman, too. I think he expects his wife to pull her weight in the world as long as she's here.\"\n\nMr. Jamieson's sharp blue eyes softened a little.\n\n\"I know the separation's hard to bear, Mary. But have faith, Child—if that accident didn't take you along with Ken and your baby, it must have been for a purpose. Won't you take the job?\"\n\nMary looked at him soberly.\n\n\"The only job I'm interested in is being Ken's wife and having his children. When I was in the hospital, I prayed to die. I still do. Do you think I want to teach little children, feeling like that?\"\n\nWithout a word, the principal bowed his head in defeat and left the house.\n\nPoor kid, he thought, Ken was the breath of life to her. I guess she's been in love with him ever since she was old enough to know what the word meant. What can a mere man do against grief like that?\n\nBut that evening when he answered the phone, he recognized Mary's voice.\n\n\"I'm sorry about this afternoon, Mr. Jamieson. I've been thinking it over. You were right about Ken; he would want me to pull my own weight. I'll try it, anyway. When do you want me to start?\"\n\nTHAT winter was long and hard. The wind blew the snow into great drifts higher than a man.\n\nThe children's heavy overshoes and snowsuits dripped puddles of dirty water that threatened to flood the cloakroom, and the third grade was so crowded some of the pupils had to double up in the cramped desks. Discipline was not easy to maintain. Although she made an honest effort, Mary could not summon back the enthusiasm she had once put into her teaching; and the children seemed to sense her indifference. By the time she plodded home in the desolate winter twilight, she was bone-weary, brain-weary, and the sum total of her desires was for a hot bath and sleep. She could hardly keep her eyes open long enough after dinner to correct the day's papers. Mrs. Anderson watched her daughter anxiously. \"You're sure she's not overdoing?\" she asked Doctor Carter as they chatted on the street corner. \"You know Mary is inclined to go to extremes.\" \"She'll be all right,\" said the doctor heartily. \"There's nothing like hard work to mend a broken heart. That's my prescription every time.\" He repeated the cheerful axiom to Mr. Jamieson a few days later, but the principal shook his head. \"Sometimes I'm afraid Mary's heart is just withering away, instead of mending. She works hard, but she's like an automaton. I don't think I've seen her smile all winter. Frankly, Doctor, the work cure isn't having quite the results I had hoped.\" Grandmother Ellis also shook her head. \"It takes a new love to bury an old one,\" she said sententiously. \"Aren't there any eligible young men in the ward these days?\" All during the winter, Mary had pleaded weariness as an excuse for refusing the occasional invitations to a movie or a lecture. But finally she accepted. \"Everyone keeps telling me this is what I need,\" she thought grimly as she bathed and slipped into a fresh dress after school. \"And Grandmother Ellis will pester the life out of me if I turn Eric down again.\" But afterward, as she sat at her dressing table and stared into the mirror with dull eyes, she thought. \"It's no use. I'm still Ken's wife. I only want to be with him. Why can't they let me alone? Why doesn't the Lord let me go?\" Spring finally came; and as Mary walked wearily home after school one afternoon, she saw the first kite, leaping and dancing against the rain-washed sky, tugging madly at the invisible string that held it earth-bound. The excitement of it caught at her throat and she stopped short. For the first time since Ken's death, she was aware of the world around her and its beauty; and the numbness in her heart was swept away in an inexplicable tide of joy. She drew in a deep breath of the cool earth-and-rain-scented air. \"It's spring,\" said her heart, exultantly. But the next moment she was half running, her vision blurred with stinging tears, clenching her teeth to hold back the agonizing sobs until she could fling herself down on her bed at home. \"Oh Ken, Ken, I miss you so!\" But in spite of the pain, she felt alive in every fiber, and spring was in her blood like a tonic. The next morning she walked briskly to school and arrived earlier than usual. But someone had been there before her. On the scarred surface of the desk lay a bunch of violets, painstakingly tied together with a pink hair bow. Underneath them she saw a folded piece of ruled notepaper. She untied the ribbon and read the note: \"Dere Miss Mary,\" began the childish scrawl. \"You are so bewtiful and so sad I think maybe you are lonsum like me. Its awfull to be lonsum. I wish you were my techer. I love you.\" There was no signature. Mary laid the paper down thoughtfully. \"Its awfull to be lonsum,\" what a bitter truth for a child to have to learn! What kind of parents could the child have, she thought indignantly. Then, since the first trickle of students had begun to straggle in, she slipped the note and the flowers into the top drawer. But the pitiful little note haunted her thoughts, and the sight of the compositions to be corrected that day gave her a sudden impulsive idea. That handwriting looks like one of Miss Kissinger's fifth-graders, she thought, I wonder if I could recognize it in a composition. That night, Mary sat down to a pile of fifth-grade papers. The subject, repeated in a variety of sprawled, childish handwriting, was \"My Best Friend.\" Curiously she scanned the pages of ruled copy paper. Most of the compositions described playmates, a favorite uncle, a dog. Then came a first line that stood out from the rest. \"I have a friend and his name is Henry. He is a mouse.\" Eagerly Mary read on: \"He is sort of brown and his nose wigles. I put bred crums on the floor for him to eat and I talk to him. I wish I culd have a kitty to pet. My aunt says they are too much trubble. She doesn't know about Henry.\" Hastily, Mary compared the writing with the note that had come with the flowers. It was the same. The name was printed at the top of the composition Emily Dale, in precise, painstaking letters. Miss Kissinger was not above the enjoyment of a bit of gossip. When Mary returned the papers and inquired in an offhand manner about the child whose best friend was a mouse, the older woman gave a delicate snort. \"Clotilda Beach would burst a stay if she knew about that mouse. She's so proud of being an immaculate housekeeper. Emily's her only sister's child, you know. Susan Beach she was a beautiful girl. I think Clotilda was always jealous of her. But when Susan and her husband were both drowned, there was no one left to take the child but Clotilda.\" Miss Kissinger smiled grimly. \"She didn't accept the situation very gracefully. If she hadn't been afraid of what people would say, I think she'd have sent the child to an orphan asylum.\" Mary's eyes widened. \"Dreadful woman!\" \"No, my dear,\" said Miss Kissinger. \"She's just lived to herself for twenty years. Besides, Emily is an uncommonly homely child—sallow skin and a wide 'What a mouth,' stringy hair. She has the misfortune to resemble her aunt more than her mother. Strangers are always telling Clotilda how much her daughter resembles her; naturally, this annoys Clotilda immensely.\" \"But surely the child must have some friends,\" persisted Mary. \"Her schoolmates and neighborhood children.\" Miss Kissinger pursed her lips reflectively. \"Children are cruel. They live by herd instinct, and Emily isn't one of the herd. Clotilda never did have good taste in clothes; even I can see that. Her idea of a suitable outfit for Emily is a middy and skirt, and it's the same thing every day. And I don't imagine she's encouraged to bring any other children home with her, even if she had any friends to bring.\"\n\nShe's bright in school having no outside distractions, I suppose, and that doesn't endear her to her classmates either.\" \"Poor child,\" said Mary softly. The older woman patted her arm, and her voice was suddenly kind. \"Each of us has his own brand of loneliness, my dear. Emily isn't mistreated; there are millions of children worse off than she.\" \"I know.\" Mary couldn't explain, even to herself, why she should feel such a burden of responsibility toward a child she had never even seen. But it was awful to be alone with the pitiful little scrawl haunting her. \"All the same, I think I'll ask her over for a little visit this evening.\" AFTER the last bell had rung, Mary closed her desk hastily and went to the door of the fifth-grade room. She had no difficulty in recognizing Emily. There was the inevitable middy and skirt; there was the stringy hair and the shy, unhappy expression she had expected. But Mary also saw a pair of long-lashed eyes with a sudden eager look in them as the child caught sight of her. \"Hello,\" smiled Mary. \"You're Emily, aren't you?\" \"How did you know?\" asked the breathless little voice. \"Oh, a little mouse named Henry told me.\" A radiant smile lighted the small, homely face, then disappeared. \"Oh, did you read my composition? I shouldn't have written it. I've been so scared Aunt Clotilda would find out.\" Mary put her arm around the small figure. \"I wouldn't tell, Emily. I thought it was a very nice composition. In fact, it was so good I thought you might be able to help me with something of mine. Would your aunt let you come over to my house tonight for supper and a little visit?\" - Emily's hands clenched in excitement. \"Oh, Miss Mary, could I? Do you really want me to?\" \"Yes,\" said Mary seriously. \"I'm writing a textbook on grade-school grammar, and I think you can help me.\" It was a half-truth; at least she had started such a book once. \"I'll walk home with you now and ask Aunt Clotilda.\" Mary's eyes were sparkling as she watched the excitement in the little girl's face. They looked at each other and began to laugh with delight. Mrs. Anderson was a good cook, and Emily ate her meal with such obvious relish that the good woman's heart was completely won. \"You could stand a lot more flesh on you, Child,\" she said, eying Emily's bony shoulders. \"Mary will have to bring you to dinner often.\" The time passed swiftly, and as Mary noticed the darkness outside, she exclaimed, \"Goodness, it must be late. I told your aunt I'd have you home before dark; she'll be cross.\" The sparkle in Emily's eyes faded, and a frightened look appeared. \"Oh, Miss Mary, can't I stay with you tonight? Aunt Clotilda will be cross. Please, Miss Mary!\" \"Why, Honey, I can't do that. I'll walk home with you and explain to your aunt. Surely she won't do anything dreadful.\" The look on the child's face was distressing. \"Does she—does she spank you?\" \"No,\" said Emily dully. \"She locks me in my room and takes the electric light bulb out.\" Feeling baffled and helpless, Mary took the child home. Miss Beach accepted her explanation of their lateness with a curt nod of her iron-marlled head. \"I dare say she'll remember next time,\" she said coldly, as Emily backed into the house with a last entreating look. \"If there is a next time!\" All the way home and as she was getting ready for bed, the pitiful look persisted in Mary's thoughts. \"It's none of my affair,\" she told herself. \"Why should I feel responsible for her?\" But she did feel responsible. All too clearly, she could see the inevitable march of Emily's destiny—a frustrated, anguished adolescence, followed by the dreary process of getting older, unloved; working, caring for a tyrannical old woman while life passed by. Her aunt would see to it that she never married, and would never let her forget the burden of gratitude she should carry. Mary shuddered. What if it were my little girl, that I might have had? For a long time she sat on the edge of her bed, almost in a daze. Then, as if a voice had told her, she knew what she must do. With a light heart, she lay down to sleep and felt that Ken was close beside her, approving her decision. The next morning she went to her mother, eyes shining. \"Mother, I'm going to adopt Emily and go back to the little house Ken and I built.\" \"What!\" Then, seeing the urgency in her daughter's dark eyes, Mrs. Anderson hesitated. Something told her this was no whim, but the long-sought answer to a great need. \"Well,\" she said thoughtfully, \"it might be a good idea—a home, and someone you love to look after. Yes, it might be a very good idea.\" To Mary's surprise, everything went smoothly. Miss Beach, after a moment of astonished disapproval, was obviously glad to be relieved of an unwelcome burden; the adoption. Officers were sympathetic; Mr. Jamieson assured her she could go on teaching as long as she wanted. And Emily—her plain little face glowed with such ecstasy that Mary was startled. \"Oh, Miss Mary, do you really want me? Are you sure?\" Any lingering doubts Mary might have had were dispelled in that moment. She took Emily's small cold hands in hers and drew her close. \"I think Heavenly Father must have known we needed each other,\" she said simply. \"Shall we kneel down and thank him?\" Janath Russell Cannon (Mrs. Edwin Q. Cannon, Jr.), contributes the following brief sketch: \"I am afraid my literary accomplishments are meager. The only other story I have ever submitted for publication was entered in The Atlantic Monthly's annual contest for college students, when I was a junior at Wellesley College in 1938. It was awarded third prize. Our family consists of my husband, myself, a daughter Ann, who celebrated her first birthday in January, and a red, hound dog named Pete. My other activities include singing in the Tabernacle Choir and acting as first counselor in the North Twentieth Ward (Salt Lake City, Utah) Relief Society.\" FEBRUARY ORA Pate Stewart The fence is stretched like a quilting frame Round the lawn where the grass used to grow, And sparrows are having a quilting party Making stitches. In the snow.  _ Windy Hilltop Ezra J. Poulsen CHAPTER 1 66 THIS chilly wind ruins my complexion,\" Anne Raines often complained. \"Well, it's clean, and if your complexion is real, the wind won't hurt it,\" her husband, Joe Raines, habitually bantered. There was no argument over such a trivial matter; in fact, more often than not, there was laughter, for Joe and Anne were young and much in love.\n\nNevertheless, there were basic strains of difference in their make-up, which made it hard for them to adjust especially for Anne to adjust to the environment of their homestead tucked away in the foothills. She was thinking of this as she walked corral, where her husband had just driven in with the drill, after finishing the spring wheat planting on the dry farm. She had something on her mind to say, more likely than not to prove as explosive as a bombshell. Her shapeless straw hat askew over her abundant flaxen hair, together with her pink cotton dress, gave her a youthful, rakish appearance, which was heightened by her buoyant step and slender form. A crisp little smile played about the comers of her sensitive mouth, but a shadow lurked in her eyes, presaging a deep inner struggle.\n\n\"Hello, Honey,\" greeted Joe, turning his grimy face toward her with a teasing smile, as he began unhitching the tugs on his three-horse team. \"Well, I got done. The last round's planted, and we now have fifty acres of wheat to tussle for with the squirrels and the drought.\"\n\n\"That's fine, Joe Dear, but your face is so dirty I can hardly see what you look like. It's really a shame the drought and squirrels have a two-to-one chance to win,\" Anne said.\n\n\"Now, Pessimist, don't start pre-\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm not; I merely recall the past three lean years.\"\n\nHer lips set a trifle. He uncoupled the sweating horses and let them go single file into the small slab stable in their clinking harnesses. Joe Raines was a tall, athletic young man with a determined, angular face and a hardy smile, which, at the moment, made his teeth glisten in their framework of dirty, stubby beard.\n\n\"It's all ready, and I have a letter. Della's coming in a couple of days. She's going to spend her vacation with us.\"\n\n\"Vacation!\" His voice suggested the incredible. \"You mean she's coming to work on you to go back.\"\n\n\"Well, you must be nice to her, Page 95; you know Della. She means right. Besides, don't you think her arguments are rather sound?\" Anne proposed this question with hopeful sincerity.\n\n\"Oh, yes, very sound, and how convincing!\" he retorted good-naturedly. \"I can hear her greeting already. It'll run something like this: 'Joe Raines, if you don't get your wife and children out of this forsaken hole, I'll shoot you!'\"\n\nAnne couldn't help smiling at this dramatic flare.\n\nThey had discussed the situation many times but had come to no agreement. He loved the homestead, but she loved the city. A loud creaking and vibrating sound from the hollow north of the wheat field shocked their ears. Anne gave a startled cry. Joe muttered something under his breath, ran to the stable, reappeared a moment later on one of the horses, and rode hurriedly away. No explanation was required; the range cattle were again breaking through the fence. That was one of the routine problems on their frontier farm.\n\nAnne went to the chicken coop to gather the eggs. Happy, childish voices floated up from the creek bottom below the garden. The sounds were like music to her ears. She called, and in a few moments Dick, her six-year-old son, and Betsy, her three-year-old daughter, answered.\n\n\"Supper's ready.\"\n\nTheir shouts of approval indicated their healthy appetites as well as their physical abundance of life, as they ran towards her. There was no doubt about their loving the farm; the complete freedom of their environment affected them as it might a pair of young fawns, making them blithe and beautiful.\n\nBut Anne admitted to herself, rather sadly, that lonesomeness was almost overwhelming her. She heard Joe yelling at the cattle up in the hollow. Again, the wires snarled and sang, and the posts creaked. The cattle would be over the hill in a few minutes, and Joe would be mending the fence. The sun was almost down to the ridge above the dry farm, and long fingers of shadow were creeping into the gullies and ravines above the edges of the valley.\n\nA cat zoomed across the bridge down at the creek; a mourning dove cooed on a distant fence; the sweet smell of spring floated up from the willows and alfalfa fields below the ditch. But Anne was positively unresponsive. She was thinking of a neat little cottage in town, her most persistent dream.\n\n\"You don't really mind about Della coming, do you?\" she asked at the supper table, laughing apologetically. \"She thinks she can possibly stand it a week.\"\n\nJoe took the news with a good-natured grin, as she had expected, though she knew there would be a barbed remark about the event.\n\n\"Wonderful,\" he declared. \"I think I can put her to work digging a ditch, so she won't have time to get on your nerves by telling you what a terrible place this is. Ugh, I can hear her now, if a coyote happens to howl.\"\n\n\"That's not fair, Joe. You know Della's always lived in the city,\" Anne said.\n\n\"Just like her sister,\" he replied affectionately. \"Really, my one major sin is bringing you out into this wilderness; and, if you'll forgive me, Honey, I'll take you away soon. That's my most important postwar plan. But right now everything's uncertain. What with strikes and food shortages. Anyway, after being in the army, I love this freedom.\"\n\n\"Now would be a good time to begin looking for a job. Maybe in the fall there won't be any,\" Joe said.\n\n\"And leave our grain and alfalfa?\" A pained flicker shot into Joe's gray eyes.\n\n\"And I want to get that ditch out,\" Anne remonstrated, \"if you're going to sell?\"\n\n\"Well, it'll make the place worth more.\" He grinned sheepishly. \"You win. I've been hoping we could keep the place. I guess I'm just naturally a farmer.\"\n\nHe said this as if it were a confession of weakness.\n\n\"In other words, Joe, you don't ever want to sell the farm, do you?\" Thus pinned down, he resorted to another grin; and, after a long, reflective silence, he kissed his wife and started out to do his chores.\n\n\"I don't want to, but I will. By the way, Sam Hadfield made me an offer today. He'll take everything, crop, livestock, and all, if I'll sell.\"\n\nAnne was more in a mood for reflection than discussion; consequently, she made no reply, and when Joe left the house, she busied herself washing the dishes and getting the children off to bed. She could feel a rift growing between them, which seemed to flourish on many little quirks of circumstances, altogether simple yet quite uncontrollable; and, with a feeling of growing helplessness, she realized they both possessed fixed attitudes from which there seemed to be no retreat.\n\nAnne had met and married Joe in the city, where she had always lived, and where she had a promising position with a utility company.\n\nEarly in their acquaintance, he had told her he owned a homestead on the outskirts of the valley in which he was born, and that he had increased it somewhat by purchase. This had been wonderful news. It showed Joe's sense of practical understanding; and when he had asked her, half playfully, if she would like to live on it, she had answered affirmatively. 'The whole thing seemed like a youthful adventure, then. But the hard work, the loneliness, and the crop failures had been bitter disillusionment. Her folks had objected from the first, especially her sister Della, who declared she would expect her home within a week. This had started the antagonism between Joe and Della, and now that Della was coming, there would be some new flare-ups.\n\nThe sun was fully down when she saw Joe coming up the path, and went out to meet him. 'Well, Honey, I think we'll sell the place,\" he said testingly. \"I think we'd better take Sam's offer. He wants me to stay, though, till fall, because he can't spare any hands from his ranch till after haying.\" \"How much has he offered?\" \"Oh, well, to be exact, he hasn't set a price. Neither have I. He'll probably pay as much as anyone.\" \"Joe, you've changed your mind suddenly.\" \"It's what you wanted, isn't it?\" He slipped his arm around her in a playful mood. \"You're going to have a nice little home exactly where you want it where there's no sagebrush, and no dust, and not too much wind.\"\n\n\"You're making fun of me, Joe. But it's all right. Keep on. I like it. Now, let's run up to the point and take a look at the valley as it gets dark. You know, I must see the lights to make sure there're still other people on earth. I challenge  ? You.\" She was already running. Her slender form seemed graceful and fairylike to him. He followed, and in a few minutes they reached the top of the hill back of the house, where the cool breeze struck them in the face.\n\n\"Oh, I won,\" cried Anne, throwing herself down on the flat rock which they both agreed was officially the top. The breeze cooled her flushed cheeks and scattered wisps of her blond hair. \"Yes, but you can't get away from me,\" he declared almost fiercely, taking her in his arms and kissing her.\n\nShortly, the lights in the village several miles away began to twinkle like big fireflies, and the bold outlines of the main range towered against the crimson skyline, setting off the green and black patchwork of farmlands. For a time they sat and drank in the scene. Its familiarity made it none the less impressive. The light slowly faded, and the breeze piped up a trifle harder.\n\n\"I miss our hilltop rendezvous more than anything else,\" admitted Anne soberly. Joe gave her a swift glance. \"So will I—ill imagine the memory of it will be very bright when I'm an old man—the hilltop and you.\" \"Oh, I'd love this place,\" she made a dramatic little gesture back toward the cabin home, with the rolling hillside and small patch of valley bottom which they called their own \"if if it wasn't so tying.\"\n\n\"Now, that's a confession,\" he picked up the note vigorously. \"Maybe you don't want to sell.\" Anne was very serious. She quickly sensed a threatening climax, but she was calm. \"I'm thinking of the future: yours, mine, Dicky's, Betsy's. Yes, Dear, I want to sell.\"\n\n\"I'll see Hadfield at once,\" he decided with finality.\n\nHEN Della Olsen, Anne's sister, came, there wasn't a dull moment. Della and Joe fought it out over farming as a way of life. In the past, Joe had not always been good-natured in these clashes, but now he was really surpassing himself. And, besides, Della, convinced that a move back to town was certain for her sister and family, abandoned her usual critical, fault-finding attitude, and showed an unusual enthusiasm for everything around her.\n\nEven a log cabin, she admitted, could be rather attractive and somewhat homelike when located on a gentle slope near a ditch, surrounded by a garden, and possessing an attractive natural view. \"It can be,\" she qualified, \"when you are about to move away. But in the long run, give me plenty of people; I'm afraid of too much space.\"\n\nWINDY HILLTOP\n\nJoe, who was waiting in the car to take the family down to the village for some groceries, overheard Della. \"We'll hurry and get you to the crossroads, so you can see a human being or two enough to last for the night.\"\n\n\"Della's going to help me in the garden next week while you work on the ditch. Then, if you're really a thoughtful husband, you'll take us all to the city a few days when Della goes back home. I want to see mother and the folks,\" she declared, as they all piled into the car, including Dick and Betsy, and began rolling down the long field road toward the front gate.\n\nThe first stop was at the post office where Joe ran into Sam Hadfield. He was inside an unusually long time. When he came out, his face was serious. \"Well, I've sold the farm. Hadfield is going to take it this fall. I'm to stay until harvest is over.\"\n\n\"Wonderful,\" cried Della, \"the most sensible thing you ever did, Joe. But it's a long time till fall.\" \"Only five months.\" \"Yes, we can stand it that long,\" declared Anne, fearing her older sister might start a new crisis.\n\nDella, however, was an assertive person. \"Joe, you'd better run into town as soon as possible and see about a job. I think you can get your old one back if you let them know you'll come soon. The manager of the electric company asked me about you only a few weeks ago.\"\n\n\"But, Della, for goodness sake, at least leave me in peace for the summer. I can't go now. There's no one to milk the cows.\" \"Oh, you can get somebody. Can't he, Anne?\" 99\n\nAnne hesitated. \"Why—no. Help is almost impossible now, Della. But, listen, Joe, I can milk for a few days. Why don't you go?\"\n\nShe spoke with a sudden flash of enthusiasm. \"Yes, it will certainly be wise for you to go to town and try to arrange for a position in advance.\" \"But you haven't milked very much!\" \"Oh, yes, I have. I can handle the cows. I can take care of everything.\"\n\nThe little car swung into the lane from which they could see the gold of the sunset sweeping across the dry farm. \"Well, Honey, if you insist, I'll go,\" he said, lifting his eyes to the hills. \"But I hate to leave you.\" \"But you must go,\" she insisted.\n\nO Anne, those words proved to be the most fateful she had ever uttered, especially since they were repeated frequently during the next few weeks.\n\nDella had gone home, and Joe seemed content to work around the place, putting off the trip from one time to another. \"Oh, do hurry, Joe, we'll be here when the snow flies, with no place to go if you don't act,\" she complained. \"Very well, then, I'll go this very day.\" There was a tartness in his voice she didn't like, but she firmly held to her point. \"It's just a matter of good business, Joe, you know it is, and while I realize how you hate to leave, I'm certain it doesn't do any good to put off what has to be done!\" \"Honey,\" he spoke impatiently, \"will it be all right if I leave immediately after dinner, or shall I go before?\" He strode toward the little shed where they kept the car, his long, energetic steps leaving no doubt that his mind was at last made up. Quickly repentant for her sharp words, Anne tried to call him back, but she seemed incapable. A moment later she heard the motor start, and she hurried into the house to fix dinner while he tinkered about the car, getting it ready for the journey. It seemed an amazingly short time before she stood in the yard watching him drive away. He had denied that he was angry, as he had kissed her and the children. \"Do be careful, Honey, around the cows and horses. I'll be back as soon as possible.\" \"And you be careful, Joe,\" she cried, suddenly shaken by an uncontrollable emotion. \"Drive ever so carefully.\" As she watched the car disappear, a vague dread began to clutch her heart. Had she been wrong in demanding to be taken away from the homestead? Had she been still more wrong in her impatience? For the first time, she admitted a tinge of regret at the thought of leaving the farm. After all, they had lived there most of the time for more than three years; and now, she felt as if it clung to her, and dared her to leave. She thought of the garden, the chickens, the cows. Loneliness overwhelmed her as she called in the children and began to busy herself with the chores. Even then, there was no relief. The loneliness grew into a dread, and she became frightened. If she could have called Joe back, she would have done so. She wasn't half so sure of her ability to take care of the cows as she had made him believe. \"Oh, dear me,\" she said anxiously to Dickie, \"I do hope Daddy doesn't stay away long.\" But Dickie could offer no solace. He was about ready to cry himself. And that was but the beginning. Darkness brought new terrors. Then came dawn, bringing a shock that consumed everything else.\n\nTOO FRAIL A LUTE\nEva Willes Wangsgaard\n\nIf I could have you in my arms again, I'd have no need of sun or moon or stars.\nSuch common lights are meant for lesser men,\nAnd you and I would walk the luminous bars\nOf everlasting morning.\n\nShould I wake\nTo feel again your shoulder firm and strong\nAgainst my cheek, my heart would all but break\nToo frail a lute to bear so grand a song.\n\nIf I could feel your kiss upon my throat\nOr catch familiar love themes in my ear,\nBluebirds would sing and apple blossoms float\nAbove a hedge of roses all the year;\nAnd grief would be a dull, discarded feather\nLying unruffled in the summer weather.\n\nThe Magic Word: Efficiency\nLucille C. Richards\n\nMOMIE, will you read me a story?\"\n\"Yes, Jimmie, just as soon as I get this work finished.\"\nAnd so it goes on and on, Jimmie waiting for a story, and Momie busy with the house.\nHow can we make this house a home?\nJust what does the hoe need to provide?\n\nThe problem given to mothers and homemakers is to organize their households in a manner that will release a larger portion of time and strength for devotion to the higher welfare of the family. This higher welfare is concerned with the development of happy, healthy, and clean-minded human beings properly equipped for the fulfilling of their responsibilities to one another, to the community, and to the race.\n\nIn mastering this task, the home-maker's satisfaction will be deeper and more keen if she performs her work swiftly and perfectly, with the greatest possible economy of time and effort. This can be accomplished only through the magic word efficiency. That person is efficient who finds and follows the easiest and most effective way of doing anything. Efficiency will enable the housewife to work more swiftly, and with less fatigue. It will give her increased leisure for things more important than mere mechanical routine. It will cure the habit of hurry and worry, and it will promote happiness and harmony in the home.\n\nThe keynote of efficiency is interest. If we could adopt the child's point of view and approach our problem in the spirit of play, mountains would be leveled, difficulties vanish before the concentrated power of interest. We should learn to see in the management of a home, not a routine governed by many formulas, but a fascinating field for investigation and experiment, whose boundless possibilities furnish scope for the exercise of all the initiative, ingenuity, creative ability, and knowledge we possess.\n\nThe bulwark upon which efficiency rests is planning. Plans are necessary to success under all conditions of life and in every trade and profession practiced by man, but nowhere are they more essential than in the profession of homemaking. To work without a plan is to work aimlessly and to accomplish little. The housekeeper finds herself at nightfall overwhelmed with the consciousness of tasks unfinished or wholly neglected.\n\nIt is well to plan the entire day's program and, in most cases, the best results will be obtained by planning the entire week in advance, taking care not to overcrowd any one day. In planning the general routine do not feel obliged to follow the traditional order of washing on Monday, ironing on Tuesday, and so on. Sunday should be a day of cessation from household cares, so far as can be arranged, and it is a mistake to devote any part of it to sorting clothes, mending, and soaking clothes, or in any way preparing them for the wash on Monday.\n\nBy postponing this work of preparation until Monday, and doing the washing Tuesday, additional leisure will be gained on the day of rest, and there will be time on Monday for the extra cleaning which is always needed after Sunday. Plan daily the doing of some extra piece of work, not a part of the regular routine, such as special cleaning of a bedroom, scouring the bathroom, doing the kitchen, ironing, or polishing silver. If the rooms are gone over thoroughly once each week, doing one or more each day, and merely \"tidying\" up on the other days, the housekeeper need not worry about her house being clean.\n\nPage 102\n\nIn planning for the ironing, a great deal of time and effort can be saved by handling articles a minimum of times. The ironing can be done the day it is washed, except, perhaps, for some of the starched things.\n\nThe simple and plain articles can be taken from the line and ironed immediately if they have been hung up straight and free from wrinkles. They can be folded and put away nearly as quickly as they can be crumpled into a clothes basket and kept to be ironed a day or so later. Keep the washing and ironing \"done up,\" and do not let them \"stack up.\"\n\nNot only do we need to have a plan as a working basis for this efficiency, but also a schedule, a definite hour for the assigned task. Begin with the big things and schedule them for the periods which are most fruitful of accomplishment. Do not fritter away your time on trifles, leaving the important task untouched. Prompt dispatching of the task leads to a household run smoothly and efficiently.\n\nPlanning, scheduling, and dispatching will cure procrastination, strengthen will power, increase leisure, and promote happiness and harmony in the home. The schedule presented here may be adjusted to the needs of each individual homemaker.\n\nSCHEDULE\n\nMONDAY: 7:00 = Arise and dress Prepare breakfast\n8:30 - Serve breakfast for members of the family leaving home at different times.\nWhile breakfast is extending over this hour, the homemaker may assist the smaller children to dress, put up lunches, wash dishes and allow time for extras. With the older children off to school, the mother can turn her attention to at least three good hours of work until lunchtime at 12:00.\n\n9:00 - Straighten front rooms\n10:00 - Room may be cleaned routinely.\n12:00 - Lunch\n\n1:00 - Dishes and kitchen\n2:00 - Rest\n\n11:30 - Bedrooms straightened and beds made for those who cannot make their own. Special work: scrub bathroom thoroughly.\n\nOn other days of the week, the bath- 2:30 Each day one or two of the following tasks may be accomplished in the afternoon: shop, mend, visit school, clean basement, attend meetings or clubs, spend part of each day with the children, cook, etc.\n\nTUESDAY: 7:00 - Same as Monday\n8:00 - 12:00 Do the washing\n12:00 - Lunch\n\nAttend Relief Society meeting at 2 o'clock on this day or on the day on which it is held in the ward or branch. The late afternoon may be used for folding clothes and putting them away, dampening those to be ironed, and beginning the ironing. (Some women may prefer to iron in the evening when there is more time for such a slow task.)\n\nWEDNESDAY: Add to the regular schedule the completing of the ironing, and if there is time, clean one of the bedrooms.\n\nTHURSDAY: Clean kitchen thoroughly, including range, refrigerator (defrost), drawers and shelves (a few each week). Continue with cleaning of the bedrooms.\n\nFRIDAY: Thorough weekly cleaning of living room and dining room. Straighten remainder of the house.\n\nSATURDAY: With the children home from school, Saturday should belong to them. It is a good time to train the children to assist with the housework, although, of course, they should have their little daily responsibilities. To get a child to help in the home we must first of all work for his co-operation. This can be cultivated by showing interest in his experiences and enjoyment in his companionship. Begin early to allow him to help, no matter how young. Do not look for perfection. Ask him rather than command him. Make him self-reliant by not waiting on him. Allow him to complete his task without interference from you. Do not lecture him or scold, continually charging him with lack of love and appreciation for all you have done for him. Show your appreciation for the slightest consideration as this will help to build co-operation.\n\nIt is desirable to work out, with the family together, what appears to be fair and just. Have the child feel a share of the responsibility of the home. Do not burden Saturday with heavy special cleaning that demands your close attention and entire time. The children can spend half the day with their tasks. The older ones can press and mend their clothes, and do the lunch dishes. The boys can help with housework or work in the yard. Half the day should be allowed them for relaxation music, dance, or other cultural lessons or just time of their own. The children should be on hand to assist with dinner in the evening.\n\nThere are many good housekeepers whose tastes and talents are far from domestic, but they have objective in mind and method. Their hoes run like clockwork. They are conscientious with an eye on the purpose for which a hoe is run, and are not diverted. They are able to find time for books and music and other diversions, so that their mental and moral selves are satisfied and they feel blessed.\n\nTHE MAGIC WORD EFFICIENCY 103\n\nSixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, February 1, and February 15, 1888\n\"For THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ZION AND THE RIGHTS OF THE Women OF ALL Nations\"\n\nITEMS FROM ARIZONA: Once more I have taken up my pen to give your readers a few items from this far off place. The pleasant weather of autumn is past, and winter, grim and cold, is with us, and it has been bitter cold for this usually mild climate.... Our numbers are few here at the present time.... Our Indian neighbors are still quite friendly.... Those who have learned some of the beautiful truths which the gospel teaches are full of faith and have perfect confidence that their sick will be healed through the administration of the elders.... It is quite a curiosity to see the women at work weaving some of the pretty blankets they make. White women would scorn to use such a rude loom and the many little bits of wood with the fancy colored yarn wound on them. The designs are very pretty and so evenly arranged that it seems almost incredible.\n\nMary S. Burnham\n\nNOTES AND NEWS: Mrs. Eliza Garfield, the late President's mother, who has just died at Mentor, Ohio, age eighty-six, was born in New Hampshire, and moved to Ohio, with her husband, in 1830. A log cabin was built and a farm partly cleared; but her husband soon died, and Mrs. Garfield was left to struggle with many difficulties. She faced them heroically, refused to send her elder children out to work among the neighboring settlers, toiled with her own hands to keep them together under her own eye, and from her they received the first rudiments of an education.\n\nSELECTED STAMINA: To write an article for the paper requires some stamina; to read an article to an audience requires more stamina.

We wish to tell you of a happy time we recently enjoyed, the occasion being that of a surprise party given Sister Susan K. Greene. A little before noon sixteen members of the Relief Society alighted from their vehicles at Sister Greene's door, laden with lunch baskets and cheery smiles. After the greetings were over and all seated, a hymn was sung, after which a poem composed for Sister Greene was read.... The sisters presented Sister Greene a token of love and appreciation in the form of a purse and its contents.\n\nFanny Gorringe\nPage 104\n\nWoman's Sphere\nRamona W. Cannon\n\nWe cannot but feel that the hand of destiny guided the early history of America, a sacred land which was being prepared for the consummation of a sacred plan, the coming forth of God's kingdom in the latter days. George Washington was a key figure in that history. Yet, had it not been for the love he bore his mother, he would probably have been fighting on the British side in the Revolution. Influenced by his older brother Lawrence, an officer in the British Navy, he was ready to depart from his home to become a midshipman in the British Navy. However, seeing his mother grief-stricken at the thought of parting with him, the youth gave up his desire, remained with her, and became a patriot when the war broke out.\n\nMrs. Washington had been a widow since George was eleven years old.\n\nAt the Pacific International Livestock Exposition, held in Portland, Oregon, in October, four Salt Lake County 4-H Club girls won blue ribbons, and for all of them it was the third time to receive this honor. They are: Aileen Fowler, Crescent; Karen Wright, Midvale; Charlene Lind, Midvale; and Donna Mae Feulner, Magna.\n\nAt the recent National 4-H Club Congress, Elaine de St. Joer, seventeen, Pleasant View, Utah, was named national 4-H Club winner in home improvements, receiving a scholarship of $200.\n\nAt the \"Girls' State\" Camp in Logan sponsored by the American Legion, girls were taught citizenship by taking over the reins of government. This is a most useful enterprise.\n\nPauline Jensen, of Hyrum, was Utah delegate to \"Girls' Nation,\" the national camp, held in Washington, D.C.\n\nNikoline's Choice, Margaret Maw's autobiographical story of pioneering in Utah, published by the Oxford Press, is having good nationwide sales. An educator herself, Mrs. Maw knows the art of making a story so vivid that the reader immediately identifies himself with the young protagonist. Pioneer skills used in daily living are made lucid and fascinating. Written for girls of eight to thirteen, the book is equally interesting for adults.\n\nThe story relates circumstances where one struggle follows on the heels of another, with eventual triumph.\n\nFor several successive years Mrs. Maw was president of the Utah Federation of Women's Clubs, and of the Western Federation.\n\nISS\nMary Rose Allen, Executive Secretary, Utah Association for the United Nations, was an observer for Utah in several meetings of the United Nations delegates at Lake Success. She found Madame Pandit, of India, one of the most intelligent and interesting members.\n\nEditorial\n\nVol. 35 February 1948 No. 2\nWomen and Their Apparel\n\nTHE moving stream of human aspirations carries the individual woman along a tide over which she often exercises little control. Dazzling advantages seem to beckon to those who follow, without question, decisions which govern the majority. Often there is little apparent benefit to be secured from the integrity of individual decision. Yet each woman is faced with the vital necessity of achieving for herself a harmony between group attitudes and her own evaluation of proper procedure.\n\nA question of great importance in a woman's life is her selection of apparel. Changes in fashions are nearly always radical and sudden, and the woman who follows the extremes of a my mode will, therefore, find herself in a most embarrassing situation. If skirts have been short, they become long; if they have been tight, they become full; if they have been overly ornamented, they become plain and severe. The purpose of this abrupt turn-about is obvious: all the clothing which constitutes a woman's present wardrobe must be made to appear so old-fashioned, and therefore undesirable, that she will feel the necessity of having a complete new wardrobe. Such a decision may be disastrous to the family budget, and often the woman who thinks that she must make the change immediately so that she will be in the vanguard of those who have hastily espoused the \"new\" look, is so disturbed that the problem may seem overwhelming.\n\nThe folly of woman's dress does not lie in her desire to make herself beautiful, but rather in her ignorance or distortion of the true and lasting principles of beauty, and in her lack of recognition of the inescapable relationship between utility and beauty. It is evident that a set of dependable values is necessary for women to recognize before they can decide what to accept and what to discard among the bewildering choices which are placed before them.\n\nThe suitability of a dress depends upon the occasion for which it is to be worn. A long, trailing hostess gown, although in so-called style, most certainly is not fitting to wear for garden work, for cooking, or for housecleaning. Long, loose sleeves are a real menace around a washing machine or a stove. Moreover, voluminous clothing is more expensive, due to increased yardage, the longer time required in the making, and the difficulty in keeping it clean. Clothes which are plain and simple, and yet loose enough to permit freedom of movement, are more suitable.\n\nRegardless of the mode of the moment, the beauty of a dress depends upon fabric, line, and color. Velvet is still as beautiful as it was when worn by the Elizabethan ladies. Knee-length skirts have never improved the appearance of any woman, and they have done much to detract from feminine grace and modesty.\n\nThe ethics of a woman's wardrobe should be governed by a recognition of her financial status, the needs of her family, and the needs of others for whom she should feel a responsibility. Motives of competition, rivalry, and exhibitionism in the selection of clothes are certainly not becoming to any woman, and often result in unhappiness.\n\nThere is nothing which should compel a woman to discard her entire wardrobe at the first appearance of radically different styles. There is wisdom in the saying, \"Be not the first by whom the new is tried, nor yet the last to lay the old aside.\" There is even greater wisdom in being able to retain the customs of the past which are of proved worth, and to accept from the present only that which enhances one's appearance or one's comfort, and that which is in harmony with an individual's financial and social status, and in keeping with one's responsibilities to those who are in need.\n\nV. P. C.\n\nCongratulations to President Amy Brown Lyman On Her Birthday February 7th\n\nRELIEF Society women throughout the Church are happy to unite again in wishing health and joy to President Amy Brown Lyman whose devoted service to womanhood is greatly appreciated. This year, particularly, members of Relief Society wish to express their gratitude to Sister Lyman for the excellent biography of Alice Louise Reynolds A Lighter of Lamps which has recently been printed by the Deseret News Press. The book is a beautifully expressed tribute and life story.\n\nSister Reynolds, a dear friend and close associate of President Lyman, was a member of the General Board of Relief Society from 1923 to 1930, during which time she served as associate editor and, later, as editor of TheAn outstanding and delightful keen analysis and deep appreciation of the character of Alice Louise Reynolds, a dynamic leader of women, a student, teacher, traveler, lecturer, writer, and loyal and beloved friend.\n\nPrefacing the biography, Elder Bryant S. Hinckley expresses appreciation for Sister Lyman's careful and inspired work on the biography: \"Reading it has been a delight all the way through; for you have told the story of this noble woman with a fidelity and an understanding that you, and only you, could do.\" This book is a further contribution of Sister Lyman to the preservation of the record of the work and accomplishments of Latter-day Saint women.\n\nNotes to THE FIELD Bound Volumes of s Temporary Binders Available\n\nRELIEF Society officers and members who wish to have their 1947 issues of Thebound may do so through the office of the General Board, 28 Bishop's Building, Salt Lake City 1, Utah.

    "content": "Home Sweet Home Gail Johnson\nWATCHING the delicate old lady rock in the creaking chair, and seeing the gray head of the man leaning forward as he concentrated on a piece of wood he whittled, callous newspaper correspondent that I was, f was suddenly embarrassed. \"There's not much we can do about it, Miss. That board of men thinks we're fightin' Irishmen holdin' out for a higher price. They just don't seem to understand.\" He held the piece of wood eye level, scrutinizing it carefully.\n\nThe silence blended with uncertain shadows cast against dark walls, and no sign of summer sunshine found its way into the bleak and dreary room. At last he went on, \"Sire I'd be glad to sell the house, only it's like I told them, it's all we have. The insurance We get gives US enough to get by on, but this house is our home..\"\n\n\"When we built this house forty years ago,\" he continued, looking at me closely, \"there were other houses here, too, but now we've the only one left, and the heart of town is around us.\" The gray head moved from side to side. \"Have changed since then.\"\n\n\"They offered you $2,000 for this strip, didn't they? Couldn't you buy another place with that?\" My suggestion sounded not only feeble, but impertinent, once it was voiced, and I regretted speaking.\n\n\"We raised seven children in this house and two of them were taken from us under this very roof.\" Maggie McRae's voice was as fragile as her veined, slim fingers which toyed with the cameo at the high neck of her black sateen dress. \"We just can't part with the happiness and tears of a lifetime for any price. Those are things we couldn't sell.\"\n\nHer eyes smiled toward her husband, and, without knowing why, that glance between them made me understand.\n\nThe deep voice took up the recital, \"When that big company bought this block for a department store and parking lot, some men came here and tried every way to make us see their point of view. That was simple enough, but they didn't seem to be able to see outside of it.\" The house is on the forty-five-foot line. Guess you know the rest, about how they built the wall across the pack and along the two sides of the house.\"\n\nYes, I knew the rest. When the big corporation's plans to dismantle Mike and Maggie McRae's home for the construction of a parking lot had gone awry, the corporation had built a brick wall, roof high, around three sides of the little dwelling.\n\nThe too severely they had thousands of dollars invested in their new building and a forty-year-old house nestled in the middle of their concrete parking lot looked preposterous. As a reporter, I knew this, but my heart went out to this helpless couple destined to spend their few remaining years in a dusky glow.\n\nWhen I left them that morning to go back to the paper, I carried with me thick notes for the human interest yarn for which I had been sent, but my pity erased the feeling of a job well done.\n\nMy only thought was of the McRaes in their parking-lot home. During the ensuing ten months the McRaes often touched my thoughts, and I recalled them with tenderness and concern. At each remembrance my uneasiness about their welfare became more personal. Finally, my desire to know how they were faring came near to becoming an obsession. In my memory the lines and features of the aged face of Maggie McRae were as finely chiseled as the expert workmanship of the gold encircled cameo pinned against the high neck of her dress. The silver hair, coiled in a circular roll atop her head, I recalled, was the smartest of coiffures of today. I felt, however, that she had been childishly unaware of any claim of being modern. During my visit she had had eyes only for the knitting needles, expertly propelled by her veined hands. I pictured the house and the people so well, so clearly. Ike was equally a part of the picture. His thick white hair encircled by a halo of futility brought a lump to my throat as I recalled his need for a warmer sweater or sturdier carpet slippers. At last my feature writing career gave me the opportunity of returning to Montana for a follow-up story the next year. My editor ordered an assignment on the old Broadwater Hotel in Helena, near where the McRaes lived. Broadwater had been the Saratoga of the West and the solid gold doorknobs, of which it had boasted, had been turned by early statesmen. Our rooms still held dusty, frayed elegance of the last decade. Because of these musty fragments, I found myself again aboard a plane, covering the miles toward Montana and the McRaes. Two days later, the assignment finished and sent on its way to the office, I was on my way to Great Falls.\n\n\"I'm going to see what has happened to the McRaes at last,\" I said to myself. From Helena, by air, it is a scant half-hour trip. I was no sooner settled in my seat than the light instructing all passengers to fasten their safety belts was flashed.\n\nWHEN I had finally been deposited at the hotel by the airline limousine, had checked into an air-cooled room, and had freshened up, I started for the street to see with my own eyes the house with the wall, silently praying that I would find it as I had left it the year before.\n\nAs I paused at the hotel desk to leave my key, it would have been simple to inquire of the clerk or Mr. Walter, the hotel manager, as to the whereabouts of the McRaes. Yet, somehow, I had become sentimental about the dwelling and the people inhabiting it and didn't want to discuss it, for fear I'd be told it was gone. So, I smiled in response to the desk clerk's greeting and said nothing.\n\nStrolling seemed preferable to hurrying to my destination. I wasn't sure if it was because I wanted to window-shop or because I dreaded, now that I was nearly there, what I might find.\n\nAt last I stood still, seeing in real life that building and home which had been in my mind for the past year.\n\nYes, the wall still stood, but the gray house was gone!\n\nThe strip of ground leading to what I had come to see was now as if measured from a giant bolt of green velvet! A wire fence, the height of the adjoining brick wall ran on both sides of the strip and across the front, along the street where I stood. A swinging gate was the sole entrance to the enclosure and seemed to invite me to enter, as did a white house with green shutters, meeting my stare of disbelief.\n\nI pushed the gate half open, then paused. It was changed, perhaps I'd regret going farther.\n\nSuddenly I had to know, and the gate swung behind me. The grass was smooth and well-kept and flowers bloomed. I stopped before the house. There hadn't been a porch before, I remembered clearly, but now three steps led onto a small veranda. Half reticently, my knuckles rapped the door.\n\nA shuffling sound from within told me the door would soon be opened. It was, and there stood Mr. McRae. Leaning a shade forward, he squinted, trying to recognize me in the early dimness of evening.\n\nRelief held me silent, but finally released the reins of tension, and I spoke. \"Remember me, Mr. McRae?\" I asked. \"I was here last summer from the Midwest Magazine?\"\n\nTears were in the way of both my vision and my voice.\n\nHis Irish face lighted up and he extended a gnarled hand, pulling me over the threshold.\n\nMy eyes clung to his sweet smile and I was unaware of another presence until I felt an arm around my waist. Looking down at the kindly old lady, I couldn't resist kissing the wrinkled forehead.\n\nBETWEEN them I was drawn into an old-fashioned room, but it was no longer dreary and threadbare. Ruffled tie-back curtains replaced the beige lace previously covering the panes, and soft green walls added warmth.\n\nI blinked amazed eyes, and my ears were deaf to what their voices were saying as I heeded the changes in the cozy room.\n\nWhat has happened? I asked myself.\n\nFinally, Father McRae's voice broke through my preoccupation. His blue eyes were dancing. \"Here is another story, Miss?\" he asked. I nodded, too amazed to speak. \"Sure'n we've got one for you this time,\" he continued, \"all thanks to you and that story you wrote about us the last time you were here.\" Like lights on a Christmas tree in an otherwise darkened room, his face fairly twinkled. The old, dejected look was gone, and I knew the sadness had disappeared forever.\n\n\"You just settle yourself right here and Mike will tell you all about it,\" said Mother McRae. \"I'll fix you some milk and a piece of cake. It's delightful to see you again, my dear, and we owe you so much.\" Mrs. McRae patted my shoulder, then left the room.\n\n\"Really, I can't believe what I see,\" my head indicated the whole room. \"It's wonderful, and you both look so well and happy. As a matter of fact, you look quite dapper in that sport sweater you're wearing, Mr. McRae.\" The smile I felt on the inside was bursting forth on the outside.\n\n\"Oh, I can't tell you how happy it makes me to find you like this!\" \"No more happy than it makes us to know you've remembered us, Miss,\" he replied. \"You know, things seemed to change for us from the minute you were here. Now that you're back we have to celebrate. That's why Mother is fixing us a party.\" He half-whispered, as though it was our private joke.\n\nIKE McRAE spread a newspaper at his feet, and picking up a piece of wood and his jackknife, whittled as he began, \"Shortly after you left, Miss, the corporation offered us $3,000 for our strip, but in spite of it we just couldn't sell. Like we told you, money could never buy the years we have invested here.\" And so the story unfolded. Curiosity seekers had begun coming to their door to see what strange species of mankind lived within the arms of the brick wall. Tourists had come to make it as much a \"must\" on their list of what to see as they had the Giant Spring, pouring forth its gallons of water every minute, or the smelting plant of the Anaconda Copper Mining Company. Days that had been uneventful, now became something to anticipate, and anticipation had become a vitamin. Miniature wooden animals Mike had carved were bought and sent over the country. Knitting needles had created bed jackets and baby sweaters to fill the lagging days of old age. As the days passed those handmade articles sold for a tidy sum, and the stiffening fingers had many orders to fill. \"Guess somebody wanted to be more'n good to us.\" He was silent for a moment, but, realizing that his story wasn't finished, I waited. \"That's the cake part of it,\" he finally continued, \"now for the frosting. People used to leave their kiddies in their cars while they went in and did their shopping. Y'know what?\" His eyes crinkled in amusement, and he pointed the carving he held in his hand toward me. \"Some of those cute little tykes could just barely toddle and others were nearly grown youngsters, but they all began coming over to take a peek at the house with the wall. It fascinated them. It got so Mother was making cookies nearly every day so we'd have a treat on hand for our little guests. Finally, lots of the mothers came with them and the same ones came time after time. Sure'n they would. Before long Mr. Elwood, he's the manager of the store, called us again. Mother just laughed, because now so many nice people came here every day, we'd never sell.\" His pause was only a second long. \"Y'know, people write us letters and we get postcards, too, something every day. We like the colored postcards best, though. We even had one sent to us from England and one from Mexico City.\" He hesitated again, wondering if I was duly impressed. I was! \"Anyway, back to Mr. Elwood. We told him we still wouldn't sell. Well, not fifteen minutes later, who do you suppose knocked at the door? Sure'n it was Mr. Elwood. This time his proposition was different.\" Now he settled back and ceased his carving. \"He offered to plant the grass and put the fence around the property; besides, he said he'd pay us $65 a month, if people who came to his store to shop could leave their 3 children here while they were in the store. Mother, right off, said 'yes.' \"We've gotten so we like Mr. Elwood real well. He often drops over in the afternoon to pass the time of day and have a glass of milk or a cookie and talk to any of the little folks calling on us. Y'know, we even get a discount on everything we buy in Mr. Elwood's store!\" Plainly life was being good to the McRacs, and I was relieved of the mental cross I had borne concerning them. As if from a distance, I heard Mike's voice again and it was steeped in wonderment. \"Sure'n because 'we couldn't get around that brick wall it brought us more happiness than we ever dreamed was possible.\" His head swayed from side to side as he resumed his whittling. Again, I lost all semblance of my profession and my eyes felt tear-trouble coming on again. My heart was beating overtime for the oldsters in the \"Parking-Lot Home Sweet Home.\"\n\nFOR THE YEARS AHEAD\nBeatrice K.

The Cover: Waterton Lake and Mount Vimy, Canada. Photograph by Hileman. VOL. 35, NO. 3 ' MARCH 1948 I make no sudden cry, nor voice Grace T. Kirton TULIPS The Mission of the Relief Society Mark E. Petersen Member of the Quorum of the Twelve Too Relief Society is one of the agencies in the hands of the Lord for the salvation of souls, and the women of the Church may become saviors upon Mt. Zion as effectively through it as they can in any other way. The need to save souls was never greater than at the present time. Probably in no other day have the forces of evil been so persistent as they are now in their efforts to weaken character, undermine the home, violate the sanctity of marriage, and destroy the very foundations of all happiness. The women of the Church have always been champions of the right. In the days of the Prophet Joseph Smith they rallied to protect his life and the lives of his family; they sacrificed to build the early temples of the Church, and when the time came to choose between the comforts of their Midwestern homes and the rigors of pioneer life as the price of religious freedom, they left those homes, crossed the plains, and with their husbands settled the valleys of the Rockies. They faced the dangers of childbearing without hospitals and often with no medical aid. They endured hunger and cold, attacks from Indians, and the affronts of the world. But, filled with faith and determination, and an understanding of their great objective, they applied themselves to the task. What we now have in the West came in large measure through their efforts. Without them, we never could have achieved so well. Through all their trials, they were saints and mothers combined—like angels of God ministering among men. They helped the poor, nursed the sick, prepared the dead for burial, taught culture, built character, and established faith. Great is their glory. In doing these things they carried out the spirit and the letter of the charge given them by the prophets of this dispensation through the medium of the great Relief Society organization which was established by divine guidance. The women of the Church have a great mission. It can be fulfilled most effectively if it is accomplished in co-operation with the organized Relief Society of the Church. The Relief Society is not a charity organization alone; it is a means through which homes are strengthened, communities improved, and souls saved. One day, while addressing the women of the Society, the Prophet Joseph Smith said: \"The best measure or principle to bring the poor to repentance is to administer to their wants. The Society is not only to relieve the poor, but to save souls.\" He said that the sisters are to search after objects of charity and administer to their wants; assist in correcting the morals and strengthening the virtues of the community; avoid all evil, even its very appearance; they were to pray for one another, Page 147 148 learn to treat their husbands with mildness and affection, and have mercy on one another. He also told them that they were to practice the principles of holiness. IN the same spirit President Joseph F. Smith said that the Relief Society \"has not only to deal with the necessities of the poor, the sick and the needy, but a part of its duty—and the larger part, too—is to look after the spiritual welfare and salvation of the mothers and daughters of Zion; to see that none is neglected, but that all are guarded against misfortune, calamity, the powers of darkness, and the evils that threaten them in the world. It is the duty of the Relief Societies to look after the spiritual welfare of themselves and of all the female members of the Church.\" On another occasion this great leader taught: \"The objects of this organization are manifold. It is not designed to look only after the poor and the needy as to their bodily necessities, but it is also intended to look after the spiritual, mental and moral welfare of the mothers and daughters in Zion, and all who are engaged or interested in female work. I commend the Relief Societies to the Bishops, and say, be friendly to these organizations, because they are auxiliary organizations and a great help to the Bishops.\" These inspired objectives shine like a beacon of safety now in our day. The homes and families of our communities are confronted with serious problems which require the individual and collective attention of the women of the Church. United effort can solve these problems, and the Relief Society is the one organization through which can be channeled best the co-operative endeavors of those women. One of the great tasks before us is the preservation of the integrity of the home. Broken homes are becoming like a plague in America, Recent figures reveal that there is one divorce to every three marriages in the United States and in some areas divorces equal marriages in number. This calamity is moving into our own ranks. We need to be fortified against it. The Relief Society provides a great bulwark. Its program helps make homes more secure by training women in every phase of homemaking. Better homemaking makes better homes, and in better homes will be improved character development. This activity enters into the field of child care, also, giving assistance in this regard from the time of birth on. It is a great avenue of service. OTHERS are prepared in Relief Society more effectively to meet the growth of worldliness with stronger faith and a wider knowledge of the gospel. Testimony bearing and lessons in theology are important phases of its weekly program. Other cultural work further helps mothers to make better homes. The arts are taught. 'Touches of beauty are added to the surroundings. Homes become more pleasant. Leisure time is filled with activities which promote happiness and satisfaction on the part of the woman herself, and joy and commendation in the minds of husband and children. Education in literature is an important part of Relief Society work. New horizons appear, bringing fresh hopes and higher aspirations. And then there is the opportunity to help others. Calls upon the Church Welfare Program are tremendous. These postwar years have revealed the great need for the relief work carried on by the Church. Many of our own members suffered much from the late war. Some are still in distress.\n\nBut need arises at home, also, and in the future, with national and international affairs so disturbed, who can tell when it will be even greater? Budgets worked out by the General Authorities to meet present emergencies require a great deal of organized assistance from the women of the Church. Sewing, canning, nursing, directly assisting the poor with shelter, food, and raiment, make heavy demands upon the women of the Church. Organized activity is essential. The Relief Society provides it.\n\nORK meetings are arranged periodically, and the women in groups in their Relief Society rooms, canning centers, and gardens, or individually at home, accept the work assignments. Work meetings are not new to Relief Society women. They have been characteristic of the program from the beginning. Sewing and quilting gatherings were held both before and after crossing the plains. When Johnston's army threatened Utah, the women again went to work to do their part in defense of home and loved ones. While frontier conditions still existed in the West, these women studied hygiene and nursing, and were among the principal boosters of home industry. In 1882 they established the first L. D. S. Hospital in the West at First East and South Temple Streets in Salt Lake City. They saved grain, helped the Red Cross, provided maternity care, conducted exhibits in fairs from coast to coast, erected Relief Society halls for the prosecution of their work, and made connections with other women's organizations on a worldwide scale.\n\nThese women have never feared work. They have faced every situation as it has arisen. They will face those that will come in the future with the same willingness and determination. Their program is ever widening, in stakes and in missions. Where Latter-day Saints are, there is the Relief Society. Not only does it encourage women to participate in this great program, it urges their husbands on, also, in Welfare activity, in Priesthood work, and in all other righteous efforts.\n\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith is often quoted as having said that the sisters are to \"provoke the brethren to good works.\" Usually the quotation is not given completely as the Prophet originally gave it. This quotation actually reads: \"provoke the brethren to good works in looking to the wants of the poor.\" Relief Society sisters should be ever diligent in searching out those in need. Bishops should be on the alert to have the Welfare program in their wards efficient enough to meet the needs revealed by the work of the sisters. It is all in the plan.\n\nInasmuch as organized effort on a Church-wide scale is needed to meet the requirements of the day, it is most fitting that the Relief Society now plans for the erection of a women's building to properly house headquarters for these activities, toMarcy 1948 perpetuate the ideals of the Society, and to serve as a great memorial to those of the past who have built and served so well. This beautiful structure will become a source of pride and usefulness to the women of the Church and will be an emblem to all mankind of the purity, faith, and industry of Latter-day Saint womanhood.\n\nThe structure will be reared in part by the contributions of the women themselves, who are gathering funds from far and near for this great undertaking. Any woman—from bride to grand-mother—may well be proud of membership in the great Relief Society organization. Such membership is a privilege and an opportunity.\n\nThe organization is rich in inspiration, abundant in the service it renders to its members themselves, and devoted to the welfare of others. Its program is productive of those things which homes and communities of today so sorely need. It is God's organization for his faithful hand-maidens of the last great dispensation.\n\nFIRST VIOLETS\nGene Romolo\n\nBeneath brown leaves from yesteryear, I gently rake and thrust aside,\nThey lift their purple-hooded heads, Like modest folk untouched by pride.\nThey come each spring to offer me Their largess of humility.\n\nSPRING WILL COME\nSusa Gould Walker\n\nNew life and beauty everywhere;\nRebirth to grass and trees and flowers;\nThey were not dead—they were asleep,\nAwaiting summer sun and showers.\nThe thought plants truth in every heart:\nThe houses which enshroud our souls\nWill die, but not the souls of men;\nA spring will come for everyone,\nAnd they that sleep shall live again.\n\nRELIEF Society women all over the Church are interested in the different ways that the wards are collecting the $5 quotas from members for the Relief Society building fund, and the various means wards are using to chart the progress of their fund quotas. As a general rule, the visiting teachers throughout the Church are being used to publicize the fund-raising campaign and in many instances to make the collection, once more demonstrating the oft-repeated phrase that \"the visiting teachers are the backbone of Relief Society.\" Some wards have visiting teachers leave envelopes in the homes into which Relief Society members may place their dimes until they have saved the $5; others are leaving small containers of different types and styles into which the money may be put. In some localities it is recommended that jars be kept in conspicuous places and family members be asked to place pennies or nickels in as they can. This is a good plan as it allows the entire family to participate and recall the faithful work of a grandmother or some other woman member of the family who is remembered for her outstanding Relief Society service.\n\nIn addition to collecting individual member donations, some Relief Societies are taking steps to raise money as a group in order to help sisters who may find it difficult to make a $5 contribution. One ward is turning over to the fund, for a limited time, all money made by quilting; another has a \"sale table\" at each Relief Society meeting where handmade articles are on sale following the meeting. Still another ward has a food table where busy housewives can purchase homemade delicacies for supper. Some Relief Societies are giving concerts or parties to which members may bring their quotas. These are just a few of the many ingenious methods being devised by Relief Society officers in raising the assigned ward quotas.\n\nThe most successful results are found in stakes where the Priesthood is actively supporting the program. In many wards, the bishops are writing letters endorsing the collection which are left in the homes by visiting teachers. Page 151\n\nDifferent methods are also being used to chart the progress in a ward. One ward has an arch twined with electric lights and a new light comes on each time a member pays her quota. Another ward had a neon-light building made, and the building is being outlined with light in proportion to the donations to the quota.\n\nLetters are reaching the General Board from sisters near and far containing contributions and expressing their joy in the undertaking. The following three are typical:\n\nNew Jersey\nWe.... Are sending you a check to be applied towards the building fund for the new Relief Society Building.\n\nWe have five members belonging to the Church and one non-member. This is our last official act before disbanding as a Society. We are placing our names on the roll of................. May God continue to prosper the work of Oklahoma.\n\nI have just read the article in the December Magazine about the fund-raising program for the erection of the new Relief Society Building. I am sending my money to you because I haven't any idea where else I should send it. You see, there isn't a branch of the Church near here. My family are the only Latter-day Saints here. Some day we hope to have a branch here so we can enjoy the Relief Society and all the other organizations in our Church.\n\nToronto, Canada\n\nNow that the great University of Relief Society is to have a new home, I am grateful to send my small portion. We Latter-day Saint women have been attending free of all tuition for over a hundred years. It's almost fifty years since I became an active member. I have known and listened to all the general presidents since Eliza R. Snow. All my days I have been indebted to the host of great women who have shared their faith and teachings with me, all for the love of the gospel and their sisters of all races and creeds.\n\nNowhere on earth, even today, do women have the rich opportunities that are offered by our Relief Society, on such a broad cultural and spiritual basis. Many valiant ones who have had little formal schooling, because of Relief Society, are in the forefront of all the fine development that goes to enrich our lives here and hereafter.\n\nI've always been grateful that women of other religious groups were most welcome as members.\n\nERRATUM: On page 86 of the February Magazine, in the list of wards having sent in their building fund quotas, the Beaver Ward was listed as being in Beaver Stake, Utah. This is a mistake and the line should have read: Beaver Ward, Bear River Stake (Utah)."

Dean lazily stretching her dainty white arms above her head and wiggling her toes beneath the snowy sheets. The sun was already filtering through the filmy white curtains, casting lacy shadows across her bed. More fully awake, she searched her mind for the cause of the depressed feeling that seemed to awaken with her. For a moment she saw only the beauty of the September morning. She heard the chirping of the birds in the maples outside her window. Then she looked about the room, her room, which her mother had made so beautiful and comfortable for her homecoming two months ago. Then she saw Greg's picture on her dresser, his dark eyes smiling straight into her own, his hair waving back from his broad, smooth forehead.\n\nIt was the picture that brought her sharply awake, and brought back the poignant hurt that had encompassed her last night when she had discussed Greg with her mother. When she first came home in June from music school in Boston where she had studied for two years, she had intended telling her mother about Greg, about their love, - that he was coming for her answer in September. But something had held her back, and she had kept Greg's picture tucked away in her dresser drawer.\n\nWhen she had been with Greg she had been so confident, but with her mother and her people here in Salt Lake it was different. She was afraid they would not understand, for he did not belong to her people and her Church. Yet she had not realized it would be this way, but would it make any difference? Surely, one had a right to love, and she was sure it was love she felt for Greg.\n\nHere in Utah all through the Centennial summer every town had had its celebration. She had watched the thousands of people flocking to Salt Lake City, visiting the monuments, marching in a mammoth parade, unveiling a memorial, raising their voices in song and story in gratitude and honor to the people who had come to settle this valley.\n\nHer ancestors had been among the first to come here.\n\nWhen she had spoken to Greg about her religion, he had said, \"We can be happier without all those rites and ceremonies and traditions that go along with churches and tie one down.\" She had tried to tell him of her people's sacrifice for their Church, but he had called it a matter of necessity. Civilization would not harbor their practices. \"That's what I call following a foolish tradition,\" he had said, \"going through suffering and persecution for a religion and then singing 'All is well, all is well,' about it.\" Greg had made his argument sound reasonable, and she had heard how Great-grandfather Bailey had joined the Church in England and left all that he had and brought his family to America and started across the plains only to die on the way from exposure, and how Great-grandfather Brown had frozen his feet as he crossed the Missouri River on the ice and had to hobble around on one foot the rest of his life, and Aunt Mary Blake had buried two children on the plains. Surely, any religion could not be worth all this sacrifice.\n\nYesterday was the first of September,\n\nGreg would be coming in two weeks for her answer. She still felt that answer must be yes. I love Greg, she said over and over to herself, nothing else can matter as much as love. So she had taken Greg's picture from its hiding place and placed it on her dresser. Across the corner of the picture he had written, \"All my love, Greg.\" Carol knew the time had come when her mother must know.\n\nHEN, last night, her mother had brought fresh flowers to her room from the garden. Simultaneously, their eyes had fallen upon the newly placed picture. Carol's cheeks flushed a trifle. Her mother, a bit surprised, smiled, questioning with friendly interest, \"Who is he, Carol? He is handsome, but 'All my love, Greg,' why haven't you told me, Child?\" Mrs. Bailey's voice did not hold suspicion or doubt. She had always trusted her children.\n\n\"I love him, Mother. He has asked me to marry him.\" Carol was angry with herself that her voice was unsteady. Her hands trembled. She did not want to show doubt or indecision. She had made up her mind to fight determinedly for the right to love.\n\n\"It's all right, isn't it, Dear? You are sure you love him? You are sure he is right for you?\" There was concern in her mother's voice, as she noted the anxiety in Carol's face.\n\n\"He's right for me, Mother, but perhaps he won't be right for you, for the family. He isn't one of you. He is not a Mormon.\" Carol spoke a trifle defiantly.\n\n\"Isn't one of us,\" Mrs. Bailey corrected solemnly, then OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN sorrowfully went on, \"It is all my fault, Carol. I just didn't realize my little girl was growing up so fast. There have been many things to think of since your father died, and time has passed quickly.\"\n\n\"It is not your fault, Mother, | fell in love, that's all,\" Carol said, with pleading in her voice.\n\nBut her mother went on dully, as though stunned, \"I wanted you to have more than we could do for the family. I wanted you to do the things I never got to do my own way.\" Her mother kept calling her child. She cannot realize I am a woman, I'm twenty and in love with Greg, Carol kept saying to herself.\n\nShe thought now of what her father had told her when she was a little girl, before he had died, \"I named you 'Carol Dawn' because you were born at dawn of Christmas morning.\" She had almost believed him when he had said, \"I think the Yes, Daddy had spoiled her, and too, with his foolish flowers of the garden singing like birds.\"\n\n157\n\nHer mother had done for her what had not been done for any of the older children. She had been the last one and had brought this can be a serious mistake.\" He had seemed so desperately earnest when she had said this.\n\nHim, Mother, him. Doesn't that mean anything to you? Does it all have to be religion, Church, and loyalty to family and a people?\" CAROL sensed that her mother knew there was a conflict going on now.\n\nNow, she had told him to avoid all this pain and indecision. Eyes lighted with a gleam of hope, \"Phil Davis will be home from his mission in a few weeks. He is going to be surprised and disappointed, Carol.\" Carol brushed this aside lightly, \"Phil and I were just kids. Our was just puppy love, Mother, | haven't heard from Phil for six months, not since I met Greg.\"\n\nAs Carol continued with her rush of words, Mary Bailey almost wished she had not spoken of Phil. \"Phil is a fine fellow,\" Carol said, \"but I could never go out to a little town and exist like Bill and Helen or Alice and Don, nor settle down with seven kids like John and Betty. 1 want to be different. I am different. Don't you see?\"\n\nStill, with patience, Mary Bailey continued, \"Phil has spent two years on a mission for our Church.\" She tried to hide the eagerness in her voice, as though Phil's mission might make Carol feel some sort of loyalty.\n\nThere was disappointment again as Carol spoke. \"Yes, two years for his Church, which perhaps could have been better spent going to college preparing himself for a job that would take him away from this small-town stuff, or he could have worked and earned quite a sum to make some good investment.\"\n\n\"But Phil wasn't thinking of himself, Carol. He was willing to serve others, give them a chance to hear the truth,\" Mrs. Bailey said.\n\nCarol was ready again with her answer. \"But Mother, so much time and money spent, and perhaps only one or two, maybe not even one person believing his words. You know our Don only baptized one person and our Bill only two. You and the whole family scrimped and saved, sacrificing for them to go, just for those three people to join the Church.\"\n\n\"You do not understand, Child,\" her mother explained. \"Don and Bill perhaps planted the seed of truth in many hearts that will grow and grow until some other elder comes along to harvest what they sowed.\"\n\nCarol had hoped that the morning would bring peace and assurance of what her course should be. Instead, there was still this awful uncertainty and depression. She stood before the open window and gazed down from her home on the heights over the city. She tried to draw tranquility from the world outside.\n\nSoft white clouds floated lazily over the roofs. The ivy clung close to the white stone wall that hemmed the wide lawn. Tall marigolds bloomed in elegance beside the house.\n\n\"The world is so beautiful and peaceful,\" Carol thought.\n\n\"Why can't our lives be like that?\" But over and over her mother's words of the night before kept repeating themselves in her mind, \"You must choose for yourself, Carol. No one can do that for you.\" If her mother had not blamed herself, if she had accused and forbidden, it would have been easier to fight back. She did not want to hurt her mother, but she didn't want to hurt Greg and herself either. All through the day she battled this indecision. Evening found her almost ill from the emotional conflict of the day. She walked listlessly about the garden. A cool breeze fanned her flushed cheeks. The garden was bathed in moonlight. The fragrance of flowers came to her from all around. In the moonlight she could see the temple spires pointing upward and the angel holding his trumpet. Ever since she was a little girl she remembered seeing the angel there, but she had gazed at it impassively. In a distant sort of way she had known the message the angel sounded represented a way of life different from all the world. Now, in the bright moonlight it gleamed like something celestial. All her brothers and her sisters had been married here in this temple. Carol thought of her oldest brother, Bill. He had always been so steady and fine. He was a bishop down in a little town in Southern Utah. Now, he would have liked to move to a town where his children could have better schools, but he said that God had called him to a position, and he would not run out on it. John lived on a farm in Weber County. He and Doris, his wife, had to go six miles to Church in a rattly old car, but they always went, and they paid a tenth of what they made from beans and potatoes and milk and cream, for tithing. Alice was as steady as the Rock of Gibraltar. When Don went on his mission, she had sent twenty-five dollars from her meager earnings to help him, saying, \"Sacrifice brings forth the blessings of heaven.\" Carol remembered hoping the blessings of heaven would be better than the blessings of earth for all of them. As Carol neared the house she heard voices from the front porch. It was her mother and Grandmother and Grandfather Brown. They had come from their home in Idaho for the Centennial parade and had stayed on with her mother to visit. It was Grandma Brown speaking, \"You should not have let Carol go away alone for so long, Mary, but I hope she will come to her senses.\" Carol felt guilty, hearing them, but they were talking about her, she knew. Her heart felt a little lighter as her grandfather said, \"Of course she will come to her senses. Our Carol Dawn will not let us down. She is just disillusioned for the moment. You have taught her what is right, as you did the others.\" Carol moved away quickly. She did not want them to know she had heard, but there was a little bit of happiness in knowing that grandpa had faith in her. Oh, what could she do about it? She entered the back door and went up the stairs to go to her room. As she passed her mother's door, she noticed it was open. On the bed was a collection of relics of pioneer days. They had been on display in town throughout the summer and had just been brought home. There was a Paisley shawl that Great-grandmother Bailey had owned, great-grandfather's pearl-handled cane, an English prayer book, a beautiful feather fan of Great-aunt Zina's, and a lovely white satin wedding gown that was her Grandmother Brown's. Carol touched the things carefully. She picked up a leather-covered book. It was an old journal, kept first by Great-grandfather Bailey.\n\nCAROL opened the cover. The date was April, 1848. She read of the hardships in Winter Quarters and crossing the plains, but there were no complaints. He told of Indian raids, of buffalo stampedes, of babies being born in covered wagons on the plains. Then he told of the weakening illness that was sapping his life away. The last lines brought tears of pity to Carol's eyes, \"I had wanted so much to reach Zion and join the saints and make a home there for my dear family but it seems God wills it otherwise. I cannot go on. I pray our kind Father will take care of my dear wife and our little ones.\" Then there were a few lines written by his wife. Carol read them, wondering at the faith of these people who were her progenitors. \"My dear husband, John Bailey, passed to his reward, June 6, 1848. May God watch over his lonely grave and keep me and our children in safety on our journey, and give us peace in the new land of promise.\" Elizabeth Bailey signed her name to these few solemn lines. How could they, oh, how could they praise God and ask his blessings when he had taken the father away and left the mother and children alone in that awful wilderness? Carol thought with bitterness. This seemed to be a family record, for the next entry was made by her father's father after they had reached the Valley. He wrote of tilling the land, making irrigation ditches, of the building of the Tabernacle and the beautiful temple. Carol re-read his last lines. \"We have tried to build well all we have done here, that it might stand for our future generations. We came here not for ourselves alone, but that our children and our children's children might grow and increase in faith and become a light to all the world.\" \"Our children's children,\" Carol said to herself, softly, \"and I am one of them. Oh, Grandfather Bailey, you must be so ashamed of me!\" There was one more page, which her own father had written on his wedding day. \"Today is our wedding day,\" he had said, \"Mary Brown and I were married this morning in the Salt Lake Temple; not until death do us part, but for time and all eternity. Mary was as beautiful as an angel in her lovely white dress.\" Mother must have been a lovely bride, beautiful and good, Carol thought to herself, and she is still beautiful. I wish father could see her now. They were married in the Temple. That is the way father would want it for Greg and me, but it will never be that way for Greg, I am sure, Carol thought sadly. Until death do us part. That is how it would be with me and Greg. All this about marriage suddenly took new meaning for Carol. Her grandfather and her own father had both died and left their families, yet they were still theirs, through time and all eternity. Carol closed the old journal and went slowly down the stairs, holding it in her hand.\n\nThe radio was playing softly, and the Centennial singers began singing \"Come, Come Ye Saints.\" As they sang on, she felt that she could now understand how those people who first had sung it with such fervor must have felt when they said, \"All is well, all is well.\" Then the voices sang, \"High on the Mountain Top,\" and then \"True to the Faith.\" As their words came out so clear on the air, Carol followed the words carefully. When they began the refrain she joined with them, and sang the words, \"True to the faith which our parents have cherished; true to the truth for which martyrs have perished; to God's command soul heart and hand faithful and true we will ever stand.\" She was one of the youth of Zion, and she must not falter.\n\nOUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN\n\nAs her sweet voice floated out on the air, the voices of her mother and grandmother on the porch became hushed. A flood of tears filled her mother's eyes. Carol went out to them, holding the old journal in her hand. She opened it to the lines her grandfather had written, and taking her mother by the hand, she read, \"We came here not for ourselves alone, but for our children and our children's children, that they may grow and increase in the faith and be a light to all the world.\" With thankfulness in her face, Mary Bailey said softly, \"Oh, you do believe, Carol Darling. I am so happy.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mother,\" Carol said, \"I am one of those children.\" Then, with a bright smile, she continued, \"Did you say Phil would be home in a few weeks from his mission? I hope he will be glad to see me. Maybe he will be able to go to school here in Salt Lake this winter, and then I think I would even go out to his little town to live.\" Her face clouded a trifle for a moment as she said, \"Good night. I have a letter I must write to Greg. I hope he will understand.\"\n\nMyrtle M. Dean, Provo, Utah, has had a story and a poem previously published in TheA busy housewife and mother, Mrs. Dean submits the following brief sketch of her activities: \"I have always been interested in writing and have written stories and poems since I was a young girl. I have notebooks full of them, mostly in the rough. Children, four daughters and one son, and now have seven grandsons and one My husband, Charles E. Dean, has been a bishop's counselor for six years in Provo, and I have held offices in most of the Church organizations. So, with my Church activities and my family, I have had little time to write.\"\n\nTHE BEAUTY OF A SUNSET\n\nMarijane Morris\n\nThe beauty of a sunset\nIs like some forgotten tune,\nLiving for the moment,\nThen fading in the gloom.\n\nAnd yet, its loveliness,\nLike a dart,\nWill remain embedded\nIn the human heart.\n\nThen something tender,\nLike a sad refrain,\nRecalls the sunset\nThat did not die in vain."

    "content": "The Establishment of the Relief Society in Utah\n\nLouisa W. Luke\n\nHE history of the Relief Society is largely a history of the noble women who gave their all for the establishment of an institution which was founded, under the guidance of the Lord, by the Prophet Joseph Smith himself. The years that followed the organization on March 17, 1842, were, for the saints, crucial ones. During the persecutions the Society must have filled a great need. The call was to give aid and succor to the poor, sick, and needy, and to inspire to good works all the members.\n\nAfter the death of the Prophet and the fast-moving events that followed, there were no formal meetings but, as Emmeline B. Wells tells us, the spirit of the work went forward and the women kept in their hearts the desire and urge to aid and comfort each other. Especial mention is made of the service rendered by Vilate Kimball, Eliza R. Snow, Mary Ann Young, and Elizabeth A. Whitney, all these women having been in the organization under Emma Hale Smith, as president. They had little of material aid, but their loving service and spiritual strength helped many a family over the sorrows and trials at the time of the exodus.\n\nThose were days when the women were very close to each other. They were welcomed by the sick and sorrowful as they went from wagon to wagon on the long trek to the Rocky Mountains. Great spiritual Page 162 strength came to them and they lived close to each other and close to their Father in heaven. There was an exaltation to their lives as they endured hardships and privations, sickness and death, because they were unified in their purposes, in their faith, and in their loyalties to their leaders.\n\nWe reap the results of the strength and activity of these men and women in the great commonwealth of today. No people could have developed widespread communities from the desert and the wilderness as they did, had they not had spiritual strength from God, unity in their purpose, and loyalty to each other.\n\nIt may seem strange that a few years elapsed between the exodus and the general holding of Relief Society meetings in the new territory. We know that during those years women were carrying on the work. They were aiding the sick, feeding the hungry, teaching the gospel, improving their minds, and all the while carrying on with the hard labor that goes into the establishment of a new community.\n\nThe earliest organizations after the saints came West were made in 1851 and 1852, when scattered Societies were established and the sisters came together to assist each other in sewing and nursing, and to clothe the Indians. In 1855, President Young called upon the bishops to organize a Society in each ward. Among others, there is a record of Bishop Ara Hoagland of the Fourteenth Ward, Salt Lake City, organizing a Relief Society September 14, 1856, with Phoebe W. Woodruff as president.\n\nThe work was interrupted, however, by the coming of Johnston's Army in 1858.\n\nLIZA R. Snow had found her place among the saints many years before, but these new developments gave her an enlarged opportunity to serve, to express herself, and to use her talents to the fullest. She was a most unusual woman, and in her day there were few with the energy and courage to express themselves in writing and speech as she did.\n\nWhen the Relief Society was organized in Nauvoo, on March 17, 1842, by the Prophet, Eliza was called to the position of secretary. In the succeeding years, she had carried on her duties as a keeper of the records and as a social worker. In 1866, President Young assigned Eliza and Zina D. H. Young the work of aiding the bishops in organizing a Relief Society in every ward and branch in the Church. They traveled over the Territory, enduring the hardships and privations of travel in those days.\n\nThis was the real beginning of the work of coordinating and directing Relief Society activities from a central organization. Thus Eliza's life was full of great and varied activity. All her talents for writing, for helping her sisters, and for leadership were developed and put into service. This was preparation for the important position she was to hold in the last years of her life.\n\nOn June 19, 1880, the first central organization of the Relief Society was formed, with Eliza R. Snow as president, Zina D. H. Young and Elizabeth Ann Whitney as counselors, Sarah M. Kimball as secretary, and M. Isabella Horne as treasurer. These women had been schooled and tested for many years in the field of service to their fellow men and to their God. Their faith was deep and true. Their spiritual strength was powerful and enduring, and their talents were many.\n\nIt was a fitting choice that President Young made at that time and he laid a firm foundation for the modern Relief Society that has grown and become a great power for good in these sixty-seven years since the first central organization was formed. Eliza R. Snow served as president until her death on December 5, 1887. Her whole life of service stands as a monument to her, and her fine writings tell the story of the efforts and achievements of her people and herself.\n\nAt the death of Eliza R. Snow, Zina D. H. Young was called to the Relief Society presidency. Like Eliza, she came of New England parentage. She, too, bent all her efforts toward the intellectual advancement and betterment of living conditions of her people. In May of 1848 she began the journey to Salt Lake, walking, driving teams, and sharing in all the hardships of the saints at the time of the exodus. She taught the young, inspiring them to learn and to be active in their community.\n\nIn 1870, at the call of President Young, she raised silkworms and established silk culture in the new Territory. In June of 1876 she began a course of medical studies which helped fit her for Relief Society work in her own home and in the homes of the community. In the home of Brigham Young she was known as \"the doctor.\" Her interest in home nursing inspired other sisters to come from different settlements to follow her example. Relief Society has ever since had a corps of trained women in the organization to meet the responsibilities and emergencies that present themselves.\n\nZina was skilled in all types of women's work and was equal to all the requirements made of her. As mentioned above, she traveled, visited, organized, and assisted Eliza in the great beginning of Relief Society in the early days. She was an example of inspiration to women. At a mass meeting of women in Salt Lake City, November 16, 1878, Zina delivered an eloquent impromptu address that stirred and amazed her hearers. One of the reporters said:\n\n\"I raised my eyes to her standing just before the table we were using. Suddenly, as I glanced at her, I received a strong electric shock, several gentlemen sitting at my right-hand, clutching the arms of the chairs, started as though they would rise to their feet, their faces burning with the truths they heard, their eyes fixed upon her fearless face and uplifted hands. I can never forget that moment. It was more than eloquence, it was inspiration.\"\n\nWe must marvel at the strength our pioneer women had, and we realize that their power lay in their worthiness and faithfulness; faith so profound that they received great blessings from God. The history of these women stands as a testimony to these facts: that God was with them, that their cause was just, and that their mission was to establish and further great institutions.\n\nEliza R. Snow and Zina D. H. Young, the early Relief Society presidents in Utah, gave to the organization much inspiration and spiritual impetus as well as many practical methods of organization for the carrying out of specific projects which were entirely new to the women of that time. These two leaders, with scores of other early Relief Society leaders, freely gave of their special gifts and talents to the Society. Because of their faith, amplified by their hard work and great courage, these leaders were able to overcome obstacles, to encourage their sisters in the face of frontier hardships, and to advance and direct the cause of the great women's organization.\n\nMuch of the inspiration that guided them will continue to influence the women of the Church, and the work that the early leaders have done will always be a source of great strength to the Relief Society and a foundation upon which the Society can grow and improve.\n\nRECOGNITION FOR RELIEF SOCIETY\n\nA communication from Germany bearing the following interesting address was recently received at the general offices of Relief Society:\n\nGREATEST WOMEN ASSOCIATION\nSalt Lake City Nevada, U. S. A.\nThe Visitors Fay Tarlock \n\nTHE news came during breakfast. The First Counselor telephoned that, in the absence of the Stake President, he wished my parents to entertain the daughter of Brigham Young and the wife of a millionaire; and that the illustrious ladies would arrive from Panguitch at about noon, to give a week's course in some special Church work.\n\nSo began the enchanted week! Even today tiny details remain clear—the brightness of the summer morning, the music of the canyon stream, and the figures of my mother and my older sisters as they rushed upstairs and down. The ingrain carpet from the largest bedroom was taken up, beaten, and turned. The entire room was scrubbed, and the curtains and spreads swiftly laundered. My sisters worried about the beds. The springs were known to sag in the middle, but, after all, there was a bed for each lady, and so a little sag wouldn't hurt. Thorough cleanings were given the parlor and dining room.\n\nThen, merciful goodness! The large picture of Brigham Young, which had long ago adorned the living room, was found to be hanging at the dark end of the upstairs hallway. Father and mother spoke in favor of bringing it right down to the parlor to hang by Bonheur's horses. The sisters said no, definitely. It would look as if we were trying to impress. After a quick debate, the picture was placed in what was once honored to be the guest room, but which had evolved into a haven for old books and magazines and the winter's supply of dried fruit and corn.\n\nEverything was done now, my mother said, except cleaning the sitting room. This room was a perpetual clutter of family living. My skin was tight with pride when I called Mother to see what I had done unaided while the others were working.\n\nIn the kitchen there was a last-minute scurry to prepare the vegetables.\n\nThen we all changed into clean summer dresses and Father put on his second-best pants, and sat on the front porch to await the arrival. We were not as calm as we looked.\n\nFor me it was as if someone had rubbed the magic lamp. Susa Young Gates and Elizabeth Claridge McCune were coming to our home! High Church people had been in our home before, but none so eminent as Mrs. Gates, a celebrity in her own right, in addition to her famous name. And the McCune name was a fabulous one. Rich people, I thought, were of a different world. Their manners, their dress, their very ways of thinking were beyond us. Yet tonight Mrs. McCune would sleep in my bed.\n\nPage 165-166\n\nIt was not a long wait. Soon there came the noise of a car bumping its way to our street. Out of the dust emerged the First Counselor's car. The First Counselor, dark and dignified, opened the rear car door for two passengers, swathed in gray-linen dusters and veils. As they came towards us under the shade of the mulberry trees, they shook the red dust of Southern Utah from their clothes. Another year or so, and cars would be gliding over smooth roads. This day, however, some of our roads had a kinship with pioneer trails. The First Counselor brought the ladies hurriedly down the gravel walk to the front porch. He told the ladies, not without anxiety in his well-bred voice, that he was sorry the Stake President was away. They would, he felt sure, be comfortable with Brother and Sister Ollerton. Then he made a hasty exit, his very back showing his relief.\n\nThe ladies, still swathed in veils, sat in the porch chairs. Among their bags was a large one with foreign labels. My hands itched to touch it. Father, as if he read my thoughts, picked up this bag and a still larger one, and started towards the stairs. Mrs. McCune, a slender, gray-haired woman, rose to follow him. Mrs. Gates, whose hair was a more beautiful gray, and who was heavier in figure, did not rise. Other than her brief greeting, she had been silent. Now she lifted her right hand, and in the voice of one used to command she said, \"Elizabeth! Wait a moment!\" Startled, as were we all, Mrs. McCune came back. What could be wrong with our house? It was a white brick one, made of the best native materials and put together by the best craftsmen in Parowan. Guiltily, I thought of the sagging springs. No, Mrs. Gates could not know of them.\n\nFather was silent and puzzled. With us, he waited for the pronouncement, which came after a long, dramatic pause. \"We are requested to stay with the Stake President,\" said the daughter of Brigham Young. Father started to say something, changed his mind, and set down the luggage. He went to the telephone, fastened on the wall. After he had cranked the handle and contacted central, there was a slight wait, probably to give the First Counselor time to get inside his house. Father stated his message almost as briefly and firmly as Mrs. Gates. Turning from the telephone, he told the ladies the First Counselor would come at once. Then with a suaveness of which we were proud, he sat down to entertain the ladies. He inquired about the journey, commiserating with them over the roughness of the roads, the heat, the dust. Mrs. McCune laughed, lightly and melodiously, as a great lady should. \"I told Susa this morning,\" she answered, \"that when we got to the railroad, I would faint in the arms of the first Pullman porter.\"\n\nMother excused herself quietly and came back with a pitcher of ice water. Nowadays, ice water would be only a common courtesy, but that day it was a social triumph. There were few ice houses in Southern Utah, and we had one. The ladies fairly seized upon the water, unable to believe the tinkle really meant ice. Then father asked Mrs. McCune about her father, recalling a time long past. \"Ah, my dear Father,\" she said, and smiled wistfully as she told of him.\n\nTHE VISITORS\n\nTurning to Mrs. Gates, father asked her about some men in Utah's political life. Deftly he maneuvered the conversation to inquire if she were still writing. \"It is time,\" he said, \"that you gave us another John Stevens' Courtship.\" A light came into Mrs. Gates' eyes. She fairly scintillated as she talked. I could not take my eyes from her spirited face; her vibrant voice was like a spell.\n\nThe chugging of the First Counselor's car was an unwelcome interruption. He told the ladies he would be only too happy to have them as his guests until the Stake President returned. Reaching for the bags, his gesture invited the ladies to rise. Mrs. McCune, on the edge of her chair, was poised for instant flight. Only Mrs. Gates was immobile. \"We will stay with Brother Ollerton,\" she said, facing the now thoroughly mystified First Counselor, who stayed only long enough to tell the ladies he would call for them at two o'clock and convey them to the schoolhouse.\n\nMrs. McCune, with a light step, ran ahead of my father and the bags. Mrs. Gates, walking behind, was dignified, her head high. I wondered if the picture should not be hanging in the parlor, after all.\n\nTHE NEXT MORNING, AND EACH MORNING THEREAFTER, I smoothed my braids, put on a clean apron, and knocked at the visitors' door. At my feet were two enormous white pitchers, one filled with warm water, one with cold. Pridefully I announced that first morning that by next summer there would be running water in the house, from the soon-to-be 157 water system.\n\nThis did not elicit so much as a raised eyebrow from the ladies. I suspect now that they were a little weary of performing their ablutions in water from a pitcher. That was the last and only disappointment they gave me.\n\nThe week became a veritable Arabian Night's entertainment, with two gifted Scheherazades to make each minute seem a second. No two women could have been more charming or gracious guests. Totally unlike, they had a genuine love for each other, and they gave generously from the rich store of their past. It was a quieter and a more innocent day. There were no radios; the movies were not common. The townspeople, awed, perhaps, by the luster surrounding the ladies, gave no entertainment for them. It may be that the ladies themselves requested quiet because of the labor of long classes. Whatever the reasons, we had them to ourselves during the late afternoons and evenings.\n\nNights we sat in the parlor, leaving the doors open to catch the canyon breezes. The room was a large one with a rose-splattered, axminster rug, white woodwork, and ecru net curtains.\n\nFor furniture there were bookcases, a parlor organ, a congress chair, and a round table, made long ago by Parowan's cooperative society, a low-hanging wooden chandelier, wicker chairs, and a leather sofa bought from Sears and Roebuck. I thought it a charming room. The mealtimes were also memorable. The food was wonderful—fruit and vegetables fresh from the orchard and garden. There was thick cream, butter, freshly churned, and ice cream made on the back porch, along with homemade bread, 168 cakes, and pies. Chickens came from our hen house. In the morning there were omelettes, garnished with bacon and ham, home-cured. Mother brought out her best relishes and jellies to accompany her snowy Irish linen and her china with the wild-rose pattern. When the sign \"Fresh beef for sale here\" appeared in a local store window, we had roasts and steaks. At first, Mrs. Gates came only to the noonday dinner; it being her custom to eat but one meal a day. One evening, however, she was in the parlor walking back and forth in her long black dress. \"Is that what you have for supper every night?\" she asked, stopping suddenly, and peering through the arch that separated her from the dining room. \"Yes, every night,\" answered Mrs. McCune, \"and it gets better every meal.\" Mother brought out an extra service and adjusted our seating to give Mrs. Gates her accustomed place at the foot of the table. From then on her conversation enriched every meal.\n\nMuch of what they talked about was over my head, but I listened breathlessly. I sensed the things of which they talked—the universal problems of the human mind. Contact with Mrs. Gates' bright intellect stirred something within me for the first time.\n\nBest of the conversations were about travel. Even as a small child, I had a strong urge to see the world. Now the door opened slightly for me. Enchanted, I moved through art galleries and cathedrals. In awe, I watched the Pope give audiences in the Vatican. And I was silent before the Roman graves of Keats and Shelley.\n\nMrs. Gates was a leader in the fight for women's rights. She had represented the women of the Church and of Utah on many a valiant battleground. Thirteen times she had crossed the continent in a chair car as a spokesman for some Utah organization. I can still hear her clear voice telling us that she went via chair car because there had been no money to waste on Pullmans.\n\nMrs. McCune, who had a light heart and a delightful wit, told of being in London with a Utah friend whom I shall call Mrs. X. Mrs. X came in one day all aflutter. She had been invited by a member of Parliament to have tea in the House of Commons. Mrs. McCune was to go, also.\n\n\"Now, Elizabeth,\" pleaded Mrs. X, \"for goodness sakes, forget the Word of Wisdom for once. I could never stand the humiliation if you refuse tea.\"\n\n\"I didn't want to humiliate anyone,\" Mrs. McCune told us. \"I said that I would try to be wise and ask for a cup of hot water.\" They went to the House of Commons. Mrs. X sent up her card. They waited, Mrs. X nervous in her anticipation. The nervousness turned to anxiety. Still no reply.\n\n\"I couldn't stand to see her disappointed,\" Mrs. McCune related, \"so I told her that we would go over to the House of Lords. I knew a member there.\" They went to the House of Lords, and were received by a duke who had been a guest of the McCunes in South America. For tea he took them to a terrace overlooking St. James Park and Buckingham Palace.\n\n\"You,\" said the duke, in his charming way, \"do not drink tea.\"\n\nBowin' to Mrs. X, he smiled and said, \"I am acquainted with the habits of Utah people. For the three of us today I shall order a special lemonade.\" That was a lesson to me. I could see the trio so plainly—a duke, with two ladies dressed in silk and ostrich plumes and white kid gloves, sipping lemonade on the terrace.\n\nMrs. Gates took the mantel of Scheherazade. She told us a tale of a European tour in the company of the McCunes, her daughter Emma Lucy, and a number of Utah girls. Emma Lucy was a music student enjoying a holiday. It has never been my pleasure to know Mrs. Bowen. But she is a vivid part of my early memories. To me she is always a fair-haired girl with a golden voice and a radiant smile.\n\nAll over Europe the other girls complained about the hotels, the trains, and foreigners in general, in the true tourist manner, but Emma Lucy of the golden voice enjoyed it all. One day, because she did not \"grizzle,\" Mrs. McCune gave her a golden guinea. A guinea in those days bought something.\n\nThere was the delightful story of Mrs. McCune's daughter who had five children and lived in France. A policeman tried to arrest her because she was running a school without a license. Five children, in Parowan, was a small family. And there was the guide in the catacombs. He was frankly showing off his European polish and gift of language before the stupid one-tongued Americans.\n\nMrs. McCune listened to him all through the dark 169 catacombs, then she turned to him and asked him a question in the tongue of the Ute Indians. There was one deflated guide.\n\nI was not all sitting at the feet of these captivating storytellers. There was work to be done! I had to churn. How I hated that churning! Turning the handle of the big yellow churn while the cream slowly thickened and broke into globs of golden butter was a weary process. I was at the tedious routine when Mrs. McCune came to the back porch.\n\n\"Would you let me turn it just a minute?\" she asked me, as if it were a favor. I was aghast. Surely no one in her right mind would want to churn unless it were a necessity, but I relinquished the handle. She lifted the lid.\n\n\"Oh, beautiful!\" \"Oh, beautiful!\"\n\n\"You wouldn't think it was beautiful if you had to do it as often as I do,\" I countered, twisting my apron.\n\nShe smiled, and I know now that there was nostalgia in her smile. \"I have done it many times,\" she told me, \"not with a churn like this, but one with a heavy dasher.\"\n\nSmiling still, she turned the handle until the butter was formed. After that I felt there might be a faint hope that I, too, could escape spending all my days with a chum.\n\nBut I would never call it beautiful. Later, I was to learn more about Elizabeth McCune.\n\nHer story is one of the great Cinderella sagas, a motherless girl who had lived on the so-called Muddy Mission in Nevada. With the slender hands that I saw wearing diamonds, she had helped and rhapsodized about building an adobe house with her father. As a young married woman, she had lived above a little store in a Utah village. 'Then, suddenly, just as in the fairy stories, she was wealthy beyond all thoughts of avarice. She traveled the world over, had a great home in Salt Lake City, and how many others I don't know, and knew the great and the near-great of the world. Always, she had the ability to adapt herself without sacrificing her integrity. \"When you hear that I am no longer of that big wickiup in Salt Lake,\" she told us, \"you will know that it is the happiest day of my life.\" She wanted a bungalow on a quiet side street. I had an extra duty that week, a duty I did not relish. It was to protect Mrs. Gates from the cattle of Patowan. Occasionally a cow or calf would go astray when it was turned into the street for its watering. Often as not some owner would allow his calf to graze the grass off the sidewalks and streets. On our own place, calves were forever on the lawns or in the orchard. Whenever Mrs. Gates walked about, I accompanied her, armed with a stout stick. At home, I did not mind. I could giggle about it secretly with my sister Sadie, but the day I had to escort the ladies uptown, I was downright humiliated. It was washday. Mother made it known to some of the Relief Society sisters that she wished the visitors invited to dinner. A dear, gentle lady who was related to a high Church family offered her home. We walked the six blocks in the hot noonday sun; I going ahead with my stout stick. There was only one calf abroad; it was dozing in the shade. Hurriedly, I left the ladies at. The week was racing along. One night, unannounced, the Stake President came with his wife. They had returned only an hour earlier and had come to offer their home to the ladies. 'Their house was a large one, far better furnished than ours. The Stake President himself was an engaging man, with a charming little wife of Scotch descent, witty and generous. I was fearful lest the visitors would decide to go. Again we were all waiting for Mrs. Gates to speak. Never one to lounge, she was sitting upright in the wicker chair. Quite casually, she faced the Stake President, thanked him, and said she would not think of leaving. Mrs. McCune said quickly that she preferred to remain with us. My heart was suddenly light. THAT night Father got Mrs. Gates to talk about her writing. She was a woman of tremendous vitality. When she talked, she imparted some of it to us. I think we would have stayed up all night without tiring. John Stevens' Courtship had not been mentioned since the first day. It was Father's opinion that this book was the best one thus far to come from Utah writers. He wanted to know about its writing. Much of what she told us is gone from me, but I do remember that the fair-haired heroine was drawn from life, with her daughter, the present Mrs. Widtsoe, as the model. She told us that all of the incidents connected with the United States Army were based on actual happenings. The last day came too soon. Dinner was special, with the best of everything. My sister Anne, who has a light hand with pies, made her choicest. Each was given a generous fourth. We ate the pie almost in silence, a tribute to its delectableness. The silence was shattered by a sudden noise from the foot of the table. It was made by Mrs. Gates clapping her hands together. \"Anne!\" she called in the vigorous tone I was to hear many times later in Utah tabernacles. Anne hurried in from the kitchen, a startled look on her face. \"What other kind of pie have you?\" the lady wanted to know. \"Lemon,\" answered Anne, relieved. Mrs. Gates dropped her hand on the table in her regal gesture and said, \"I will take a piece.\" There was a dreadful moment when Sadie and I might have forever disgraced our house by giggling. Not even the pressure of Mother's foot could save us. It was Mrs. McCune who did. \"T, too, will have another piece,\" she said to Anne, just in time. Father immediately ordered a second. It ended with all of us having another piece. Right after dinner, Mrs. McCune followed Anne into the kitchen. When that lady had gone upstairs, my sister came in to say in a low voice that Mrs. McCune had invited her to stay at the McCune home during the coming Teachers' Institute. How wonderful, I thought. Mrs. Gates had told us about the great stone house with its pink satin and gold ballroom, the crystal chandeliers, and marble statues brought from Italy. She had made us feel the soft thickness of the velvet rugs, 171 had described the oil paintings from famous masters. And there were bathrooms for almost every bedroom! Yet Anne did not want to go. She was fearful of the elegance and did not want Mrs. McCune to feel that she was obligated to invite her. Mother did not know how to advise her. It was Mrs. Gates, with her understanding heart, who helped in the decision. She told Anne that Mrs. McCune sincerely wanted her. \"You do not get opportunities like this many times,\" she appealed. \"You will feel as much at home in Elizabeth's mansion as we have felt in your home.\" Anne went, taking a cousin with her. Both of them enjoyed every minute. It made a perfect ending to our enchanted week to hear first-hand about the ballroom and the servants who even made the beds. The last day was also the one in which I learned a lesson in values. My Aunt Juliette stopped at our house on her way from the afternoon classes. The visitors had not yet returned. Aunt Juliette was a large, handsome woman, beautifully dressed in the basic black of the day, a swishing taffeta, and a feathered hat. \"T said to myself,\" the Aunt was saying, \"that if Mrs. McCune could wear a patched dress I needn't be too proud to wear one, too.\" Then she chuckled, \"It wasn't any better patched than if I had done it.\" COVERTLY I watched Mrs. McCune when she came home. She had worn the same dress most of the week, and I had seen no patch. I watched her raise her right arm. There was the patch, plain as day. Why did she wear the patched dress? Not because she had to wear it. Nor did she wear it to show the other women she was one of them.\n\nThere was not a particle of exhibitionism in her make-up. I decided she wore it because she liked the dress. It was a good, dark silk, easy to pack, and comfortable. Why shouldn't it be patched if it gave her a few months' more wear? It was not in her to be wasteful.\nThe final morning came. Again we were on the white porch; the air was fresh with the dew from the lawn and flowers. The visitors were wrapped in their gray wraps and dusters. I held the bag with the foreign labels. No one wanted to say goodbye.\nUp drove the Stake President. Still we lingered.\nIt was Mrs. Gates who spoke for all of us. \"You will always be dear to us,\" she said, facing us. \"I want each of you when you see me in the years to come to speak to me and tell me you are an Ollerton from Parowan. I shall not forget.\"\nThey got into the car and went bumping up the street in a cloud of dust. Silently we watched the dust disappear. The house behind us seemed quiet and empty. Soon, but not today, we would say, \"Do you remember when . . . ?\"\nNeither did the visitors forget us. The thank-you letters came first. One day the mail brought a package of books. For me, was John Stevens' Courtship, autographed by the author.\nMrs. McCune I never saw again, though my parents did several times. But Mrs. Gates I saw often. The first time was in a Salt Lake City restaurant. I was undecided about speaking. I had grown taller now and feared she might not remember me. Just then she looked up from her table and stood up, saying, \"You are one of the Ollerton girls!\"\nROADS\nGrace M. Candland\nThe road of yesterday is closed for me; Time's stern decree has barred and locked the gate. I must move on, but can it be too late To look far down that beaten track and see Where I have failed, just how I lost my chance To step on higher ground where pine trees grow And why I trailed the sagebrush down below And scorned an invitation to advance?\nToday, I'll route my path upon a grade That lifts and winds along the mountain side Where I can see new heights both far and wide And estimate the progress I have made.\nI hold my destiny within my hands And life will give me what my heart demands.\nMORMONISM IN THE EYES OF THE PRESS\nJames R. Clark, Brigham Young University Copyright 1948 IV Mormon Reaction to Criticism in the Press (Fourth and last installment of a series of articles dealing with early Latter-day Saint history)\nALTHOUGH the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was formally organized on April 6, 1830, the inaugural of the establishment of the Church was the first vision of Joseph Smith in the spring of the year 1820. In the story of that vision, published and republished in Mormon and non-Mormon literature since that time, the Prophet Joseph Smith says that he saw two personages:\n. . . whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake to me, calling me by name, and said—pointing to the other—This is my Beloved Son, hear him.\nJoseph Smith relates that after having had this vision he informed his neighbors, associates, and the ministers of various churches in his vicinity of his experience, and that he immediately encountered opposition and persecution.\nThe very first reaction of the Smith family to the press that has come to my attention is a paid advertisement which Joseph Smith Sr., father of the Prophet, inserted in the local \"home-town\" newspaper in Palmyra, New York. The advertisement ran for three consecutive issues, beginning September 25, 1824.\nThis was not the usual run-of-the-mill type of advertisement of land or livestock for sale. The advertisement was inserted by the senior Smith in an attempt to allay some of the opposition and persecution which had been engendered by his son's bold claims, and which had taken the form of malicious rumor to the effect that the body of Alvin Smith, brother of the Prophet, had been disturbed from its resting place and dissected. Father Smith says of his purpose in printing a denial of the rumors in the Wayne Sentinel:\nThis method is taken for the purpose of satisfying the minds of those who have heard the report, and of informing those who have put it in circulation, that it is earnestly requested they would desist therefrom; and that it is believed by some that they have been stimulated more by a desire to injure the reputation of certain persons than a philanthropy for the peace and welfare of myself and friends. (Signed) Joseph Smith.\nUnless some new sources later come to light to prove otherwise, we may consider it highly probable that Joseph Smith Sr. was the first of the future Latter-day Saints to grasp what the newspaper could mean in the redress of their wrongs. It is perhaps also significant that this initial use of the newspaper came not in the form of a letter or article to a friendly editor, but in the form of a paid advertisement. The above attempt to allay prejudice and persecution may also be considered to be the inauguration of a policy that the Latter-day Saints followed throughout the period from 1824 to 1850, namely, that of the use of the public press, whenever accessible, as an agency for public hearing and redress.\nThroughout his history of the Church which the Prophet Joseph Smith dictated to his clerks, he repeatedly refers to the influence of the press in relations between the Latter-day Saints and the American public. In the spring of 1831, only one year after the organization of the Church, he says:\nAt this age of the Church many false reports, lies, and foolish stories, were published in the newspapers and circulated in every direction, to prevent people from investigating the work, or embracing the faith. A great earthquake in China, which destroyed from one to two thousand inhabitants was burlesqued in some papers as \"Mormonism in China.\"\nLESS than two years after the Church was organized, a Mormon periodical was established at Independence, Missouri, with W. W. Phelps as editor. The first issue of The Evening and the Morning Star reached Joseph Smith in Kirtland, Ohio, in July 1832. In commenting on this first issue of the first Latter-day Saint periodical, Joseph Smith said:\nDelightful indeed, was it to contemplate that the little band of brethren had become so large, and grown so strong, in so short a time as to be able to issue a paper of their own, which contained not only some of the revelations, but other information also, which would gratify and enlighten the humble inquirer after truth.\n\nSo embittered was the public mind against the truth that the press universally had been arrayed against us; and although many newspapers published the prospectus of our paper, yet appeared to have done so more to calumniate the editor, than give publicity to the forthcoming periodical. Editor thought to do us harm, while the Saints rejoiced that they could do nothing against the truth but for it.\n\nIn January 1833, Joseph Smith wrote to W. W. Phelps expressing dissatisfaction with the manner in which The Evening and the Morning Star was being conducted. He said:\n\n\"We wish you to render the Star as interesting as possible, by setting forth the progress, and faith of the Church, as well as the doctrine; for if you do not render it more interesting than at present, it will fall, and the Church suffer a great loss thereby.\"\n\nAs controversies arose in Missouri between the Saints and their neighbors, reports of the difficulties began to appear in the newspapers, and both groups used the Missouri papers to present their case to the public.\n\nIn a letter written from Kirtland, Ohio, to Edward Partridge in Liberty, Clay County, Missouri, Joseph Smith referred to a communication of Orson Hyde on the Missouri difficulties as published in the Missouri Republican. He said it was at variance with the reports he had received through private letters. (D.H.C. 1:448). The interesting thing about this communication to Edward Partridge is the fact that Joseph Smith seems to have given at least some credence to the reports in the Missouri Republican, even though he was generally skeptical of most newspaper reports. He instructed Edward Partridge to gather the correct information and send it immediately to Kirtland, Ohio, so that he could in turn \"give the public correct information on the subject.\"\n\nThat as early as 1833 Joseph Smith did not overlook the possibility of using a political as well as a religious newspaper to present the Church point of view is evidenced by another statement from this same letter to Edward Partridge. He said: \"We expect shortly to publish a political paper, weekly, in favor of the present administration; the influential men of that party have offered a liberal patronage to us, and we hope to succeed, for thereby we can show the public the purity of our intention in supporting the government under which we live.\" The party referred to was the Democratic Party under the leadership of Andrew Jackson.\n\nEnough has been given from the writings of Joseph Smith to indicate his attitude toward newspapers as an instrument in presenting the Church viewpoint and to indicate that he was conscious of the fact that the press exerted influence in shaping public opinion. The Latter-day Saint Church issue was only one of many controversial issues occupying the press during the thirties and forties of the past century, and the Saints were not the only group being criticized. But editors seemed to exercise unusual editorial prerogative in their handling of the news of the Church, especially in not printing articles which Joseph Smith and other leaders sought to have published.\n\nAlthough it is quite certain that the Latter-day Saints were not the only group thus unjustly dealt with by the newspapers, it was undoubtedly this adverse treatment in the public press which called forth from Parley P. Pratt an answer, in book form, which has been one of the most widely printed and circulated pieces of Church literature.\n\nIn his preface to the first edition of A Voice of Warning and Instruction to All People, published in New York in 1837, Parley P. Pratt said:\n\n\"During the last seven years, the public mind has been constantly agitated, more or less, through all parts of the country, with the cry of Mormonism, Mormonism, Delusion, Imposture, Fanaticism, etc.; chiefly through the instrumentality of the press. Many of the newspapers of the day have been constantly teeming with misrepresentations and lying slanders, of the foulest kind, in order to destroy the influence and character of an innocent Society, in its very infancy; a Society of whose real principles many of them know nothing at all.\n\n\"Every species of wickedness has been resorted to, and all manner of evil has been spoken against them, without the possibility of being heard for a moment, saying we do not wish to hear you, we know enough of your principles already. The newspapers, or our good preachers, have told us about you.\n\n\"Under these circumstances, what could be done? How were we to correct the public mind? We were few in number, and our means of giving information very limited; the columns of most of the papers were closed against us, their prosperity being at stake the moment our principles were admitted. It is true we published a monthly paper, in which our principles were clearly set forth; but its circulation was limited to a few thousands.\n\n\"Having said so much to impress upon the human mind the necessity of hearing and then judging, I would only add that the object of this publication is to give the public correct information concerning a religious system which has penetrated every state from Maine to Missouri as well as the Canadas, in the short space of seven years; organizing churches and conferences in every region, and gathering in its progress from fifty to an hundred thousand disciples. Having at the same time to sustain the shock of an overwhelming religious influence opposed to it by the combined powers of every sect in America.\n\n\"What but the arm of Omnipotence could have moved it forward amid the rage of mobs? Having to contend with the prejudice of the ignorant and the pen of the learned; at war with every creed and craft in Christendom, while the combined powers of earth and hell were hurling a storm of persecution, unparalleled in the history of our country.\"\n\nHis quotation states the general attitude of the majority of Church leaders toward the press of the period. The following reaction of a Latter-day Saint, as recorded in his diary, is typical of a number of comments from diaries of Church members who were not General Authorities.\n\nJesse Wentworth Crosby, born November 25, 1820, in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia of British parentage, emigrated to Chautauqua County, New York with his parents in 1822. In 1838 he was baptized into the Church in Chautauqua County. In an entry in his diary for April, 1839, he said:\n\n\"The time passed... It was now April, and all things being ready we set about for Missouri— one thousand miles distant (1000) traveling by land with horse teams and lodging in our wagons; but before leaving our neighbors called often and _remonstrated with us for taking, as they thought, such a random journey. One said, 'Have you read the news: Why the Missourians and the Mormons are at war, they are killing and destroying, and will you persist in going, and running into danger and death?' We replied, 'We have warned you by words, now we warm you by light.'\"\n\nIf danger or death gets in our way, we intend by the help of God to face the same like men of God, and show all men by example that we have embraced no fiction but an eternal reality, and when the secrets of all hearts are revealed, then, if not till then, you shall know that we are not deceived.\" This excerpt shows that Crosby, learning through the press that the Church he had joined one year previously was having serious difficulties in Missouri, still manifests a determination to \"gather to Zion\" and, if \"necessary, give up his life in the cause. The statement also indicates that Crosby's neighbors accepted the newspaper accounts and sought to dissuade him from going into an area where he was certain to meet opposition and persecution. It is also evident from Crosby's reply that he or his family had attempted to proselyte their neighbors and had failed, but that they were still speaking to each other despite the rumors afloat in the press. Certainly, a neighbor who comes on the eve of departure to attempt to dissuade one from a course of action which he feels is \"a random journey,\" and one fraught with \"danger and death,\" is acting the part of a friend.\n\nWhy did Crosby and his neighbors seemingly remain on friendly terms despite the unfavorable newspaper comments? Why did they fail to follow the usual reaction to bitter criticism and rumor?\n\nAn explanation of the continued friendliness of Crosby's neighbors, despite the adverse criticism of the Church in the press, may lie in Crosby's seventeen years residence in the community. I have found numerous other examples which seem _ to indicate that the saints withstood criticism in the press better in those areas where they had been resident for a considerable length of time, and when the uprightness of their characters had been manifest over the years.\n\nYe shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? (Matt. 7:6).\n\nSentiment and Sanitation\n\nGrace A. Woodbury\n\nMARCH conference, in the town where I was reared, was, by the ambitious and thorough housewives of the town, preceded by house cleaning. Room by room, from attic to cellar, sorting, sunning, and cleaning were carried on with a zeal almost catastrophic as far as the comfort of the family was concerned. Regardless of how uncomfortable and tiring it was for the older members of the family, it was a time of fun and excitement for the children. It meant bonfires made from the straw that came from under the carpets, dancing on the carpet spread out on the grass, and playing house in the tents made by quilts and blankets hung over the clothesline for sunning.\n\nI recall that the smell of clean straw, freshly whitewashed walls, and bonfire smoke was as much a part of spring to me as were the fragrance of locust and plum blossoms, the croaking of the frogs in the swampy grass, and the meadow larks singing on the pole fence. Along with the happy memories, come those of the days when we cleaned the upstairs playrooms. I have a vivid picture of my mother coming up the stairs with an evaluating gleam in her eye, which meant that she was going to sort over our playthings. We, my two sisters and I, had some young aunts, who gave us many, so we thought, lovely things to play with, old fans, perfume bottles, candy boxes, outgrown dresses and hats; in fact, anything they did not want or need found its way into our playrooms.\n\nRealizing, as we did, that these sorting days were an inevitable part of spring and fall house cleaning, it was always with justified fears of being plundered that we watched mother, from her low stool-throne render judgment as to what should be done with our possessions. \"This,\" she would say of some limp lawn or dimity dress, \"isn't fit for anything but dusting and cleaning cloths, and this,\" holding up a gingham dress or percale apron, \"will make a pretty stripe in a carpet. These woolen skirts I will up and use the best part for quilt blocks; the rest I can use in a braided rug.\"\n\nAfter our \"dress-ups\" had been sorted into various heaps on the floor, mother would turn her attention to our efforts at decorating our playhouse. After an appraising glance, she would say, \"Hand me those crocheted woolen tidies from your doll bed and little chair—such rubbish—why anyone would want to waste time, eyesight, and yarn on them, is more than I can understand. They harbor moths and must be burned and so must these old hat feathers and artificial flowers. Sometimes we wept over the loss of our treasures, but mother cheered us up by saying, \"Don't cry. A month from now you will have a new collection,\" and we always did.\n\nPage 177\n\nYears later when I had the responsibility of deciding what to save and utilize and what to burn or give to the junkman, I realized that my mother had a \"price above rubies\" because of her ability to keep from being moved under with bags and boxes of unused and unusable articles. If I have fallen short of living up to her training it is because, so she said, I didn't have a good old wood cook or heating stove handy where things could be burned as soon as they became useless.\n\nWith our grandmothers and mothers, who had to make their carpets, rugs, and quilts, the saving of every scrap of cloth and old clothing was a necessity. However, to use their own words, they liked to keep their carpet rags and quilt pieces worked up; then they did not become a burden.\n\nThat procedure is as good today as it was then, and even though we do not have to make rag carpets in order not to have bare floors, woven rag rugs still have a place in our homes. They can be made to fit in with any color scheme, they can be put in a washing machine and cleaned as readily as a cotton house dress or apron. Old petticoats, shirts, house coats and house dresses, aprons, and rayon articles make very satisfactory rugs. Better rugs are made of all kinds of material. Obviously, a rug made of wool and cotton will not wash as well or weave as evenly as an all-wool or all-cotton one. However, cotton goods and rayon underwear go well together.\n\nIT is really surprising how many odds and ends, in addition to old clothing, the average housewife has collected in drawers and boxes, that far, but drawers and boxes\n\ncrocheted rugs. Those faded sofa pillow covers, old feather ticks, scarves, and table runners that you have used too long, faded cretonne drapes and old bedspreads, yes, those old car seat covers can be used, and bathrobes and even socks. I shall tell you more about them shortly.\n\nCan't you just visualize a lot of those attractive rugs that cost so little, if, in your spare time, you do your own rug cutting and sewing? If, however, you do not have any spare time and do not care for rag rugs, give your material to the Relief Society or to Deseret Industries. Let us not get \"snowed under\" without a thaw in sight.\nNow about the socks. During the war I found a large box full of worn-out ones that for some reason, long since forgotten, I had saved. Our four boys were all away from home, helping in various ways to win the war. Those dozens of old socks brought back many, shall we say poignant and lively memories. Since I couldn't bear to burn the socks, I decided to cut and sew them and make a rag rug. In one afternoon I started at the top of the sock and cut around and around it until it was one continuous length of a yard or more. It was gratifying to find how quickly enough socks to make a rug could be cut and sewed. Thanks to the yen that the two younger boys had for bright striped and patterned hosiery, the rug has some stripes that shine out like a good deed in a naughty world, and make a happy contrast with the more subdued browns, tans, grays, and blues of the older boys' more conservative preference in socks. Perhaps that is carrying sentiment too far, but I am proud and fond of this rug, and may as well admit that I am still saving socks, but only the ones made of wool, cotton, or a mixture of wool and cotton.\nPerhaps mention should be made that silk and rayon stockings also make attractive rugs. I made one from my own and my two daughters' stockings in which the entire stocking except the heel and toe was used and the top hem was cut open. I braided the material in much the same method as is used in braiding a round basket. The rug, when finished, is to describe it dramatically, a symphony in tan.\nThere are moments in my life when I wonder, yes, even worry about that old proverb, \"As a twig is bent, the tree is inclined.\" I know that as a \"twig\" I was bent in the right direction regarding the disposal of articles that should be remodeled into something useful, repaired, given away, or burned. Yet, as a \"tree\" I am inclined to keep things stored away that there's, if they did break in, would not care to steal, and in which moths find refuse.\nGenerally speaking, and I realize that I am rationalizing, most people do collect things—everything, in fact, from buttons to bric-a-brac. Then there are those who just let things collect. At house-cleaning time many of these last mentioned collections are given to the junkman, but often one does not have the moral fortitude to part with a collection of things, either because of sentimental value, or because one has hopes of doing something with them some day.\nI know whereof I speak, for there is in my collection a case of empty, gallon, cracked, otherwise damaged cans that have been in the basement for five years in the expectation that some day I am going to cover them with some leftover drapery material and make them into a useful footstool. Since hope is supposed to spring eternal even in a collector's breast, I am justified in my future plans, because once there were three cases of cans in the basement and I did make three footstools from them, but this spring I am determined that the city dump shall no longer be deprived of their radiance. I have some newer ideas about covering and lining five-gallon roof paint cans to serve the dual purpose of a hassock and a place to keep one's shoes. My collection of things that collect also contains a sad flatiron, clamsy, heavy, and slow, but it brings back memories of many childhood-hours, where one of the children always gave this riddle about sad flatirons: \"Three-cornered, square, black as a bear, tell me this riddle or I'll pull your hair.\"\nThen, of course, I think of the dresses, aprons, and ruffled petticoats that were ironed with it. Not long ago someone told me that just such an old sad iron would make a dependable doorstop, and suggested some improvements designed to make it fit more artistically or usefully into its new role. I cannot remember just what it was that she mentioned. It might have been adorning it with a petunia or a hollyhock. But, with or without the decoration, I must make use of that iron.\nOnce I owned a collection of nicked, cracked, and otherwise damaged dishes, but that was before Bob L., a friend of our boys, came\n\nSixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, March 1, and March 15, 1888\n\n\"For THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ZION AND THE RIGHTS OF THE Women OR ALL NATIONS\"\n\nFREEDOM OF SPEECH: How fiercely we pounce upon our best friends when their opinions are the opposites of our own!

Build up healthy bodies by good food, plenty of exercise, and sleep. Learn all the useful household arts before you attempt to make a home. Cultivate your minds with the best books that you may be able to teach your children much that school training alone will never give them. Choose your amusements wisely, for youth must have pleasure, but need not waste itself in harmful frivolity. Above all, select your friends with care. Avoid girls who live only for fashion, flirtation, and enjoyment, and use the privilege all women may claim of declining the acquaintance of young men whose lives will not bear inspection by the innocent eyes of women. Let no delusion of wealth, rank, comeliness, or love tempt you to trust your happiness to such a one.

Cannon\n\nEMILY SMITH STEWART (Mrs. Robert Murray Stewart), daughter of President George Albert Smith, has recently been accorded much recognition. In December she represented Utah as State Director of Women's Activities for the National Infantile Paralysis Conference. Utah still has the best program in the nation for volunteer work in this disease, and in recognition of that fact, Mrs. Stewart traveled from Washington to Georgia with Lady Inverchapel, wife of the British Ambassador to the United States, and with Lady Balfour. Lady Inverchapel, a former poliomyelitis patient, has given a great amount of volunteer service to patients in America, and was particularly interested in Mrs. Stewart and the Utah program. Britain is trying to establish a program to combat the serious epidemic there. At Warm Springs, Mrs. Stewart conducted a panel discussion on volunteer service. She contributed to the American Hospital Magazine, by invitation, an article on volunteer polio service in Utah.\n\nMrs. Stewart has been invited to be a guest of honor and to attend a reception for such special guests at the conference of the National Association of Broadcasters and the National Association of Women Broadcasters, in January, in Washington, D.C.. Mrs. Stewart has also been invited to be the honored woman at the Mortar Board Woman's Day program at Iowa State College, March 4, where she will speak on the subject of college women's responsibilities to public welfare. She has been recognized with an appointment as National Chairman of the International Committee for the American Federation of Soroptimists Clubs.\n\nTHE oldest college in the United States to confer degrees on women is Wesleyan, at Macon, Georgia, which was chartered for that purpose in 1836. It was known at that time as Georgia Female College.\n\nIn its fifty years of existence, the Utah Education Association has had only three women presidents: Mrs. Emma McVicker, 1902-03; Miss Hazel Brockbank (now Mrs. Bowen of Spanish Fork), 1944-45; Miss Maud Hardman, present incumbent, supervisor of art in Salt Lake City schools. All have been very gracious as well as competent executives.\n\nThis year three of the eight trustees of the Association are women: Mrs. Clair L.

During the year just past, the Centennial year of the Church in the West, we have had frequent occasion to look back over the accomplishments of our people during that one hundred years, and we have found their accomplishments great, and the women of the Church, no less than the men, have made great contributions of service for human uplift. The achievements of Relief Society women, both in public life and in the home, stand today as a monument to the power of their faith and service and as a challenge to our generation.\n\nToday we stand with our faces both ways. We look backward with pride on the accomplishments of the past. We have walked the first mile. We also look forward with anticipation to the opportunity for accomplishment that is before us in the year 1948—the first step in the second mile. We are the generation that will travel the second mile and its accomplishments will be what we, as individuals, make them.\n\nWhat Can We Relief Society Women Do Today to Wield That Great Force for Good? We Need Not Go Out and Look for New Fields of Conquest; We Need to Concern Ourselves in Giving of Our Talents to the Problems of Our Everyday Life. Never in the History of Our World Has There Been a Greater Need for Women to Strive for the Maintenance of the True Latter-day Saint Home. Let Us Get a Comprehensive Understanding of the Gospel and Make Sure It Is Being Taught and Practiced in Our Homes, Let Us Rediscover the Loyalty of Our Pioneer Mothers, Loyalty to the Gospel, to Authority, and to Our Families. Let Us Establish the Practice of Family Prayer. Let Us Keep the Sabbath Day Holy. Let Us Develop Faith, Love, Cheerfulness, and Peace in Our Homes and Within Ourselves. Then Will the Spirit of the Lord Dwell within Us and It Will Radiate from Us, thereby Magnifying Us and Making Us a Force for Good, in Our Homes and Communities.\n\nV. N. S.

Sutherland\nMy husband, Harvey, after I graduating from _ college, signed a contract to teach school in Pankapaw.\n\"Where is Pankapaw?\" I asked him, looking at the map.\nI have never been able to find anything on a map.\n\"You can never find anything on a map,\" said Harvey, telling me that which I knew already.\n\"Pankapaw is a very important town in the southern part of this State. Pankapaw has fifteen hundred people and a very large high school. We shall be an asset to the community and I will learn a great deal about teaching school.\"\n\"Undoubtedly,\" I said, feeling convinced.\nHarvey can sound very convincing.\nMy brother-in-law loaded his car.\n\"We cannot get anything more in the car or outside of the car,\" said my brother-in-law.\n\nThat is very true, I thought, looking at the bed strapped to the top of the car, the toaster on the fender, the quilts and canned tomato juice in the trunk, my hats squashed against the back window. I went back into my mother's house and conferred with Harvey. My sister said she and her husband would also drive a car down. \"Two cars,\" I exclaimed brightly, \"we shall go in style to Pankapaw, like a caravan, like gypsies!\" Harvey does not like me to get ecstatic. He looked sourly at the flapping, crammed cars. \"If the engine doesn't boil over into the things there some way. Toaster before we get there—or the bed slide off—or—\" My mother handed us a lunch and said that, much as she hated to see us go, we had better go. \"Do the cars look too disgraceful?\" I whispered to my mother. \"I do not want Pankapaw to get a bad impression of us, as if we were sheepherders or gypsies or something.\" I am a school teacher's wife now and must at all costs appear normal, I reminded myself. My mother frowned at the cars. \"Well, no,\" she replied hesitantly. \"After all, you have to get your things there some way. Toaster before we get there—or the bed slide off—or—\" My mother reminisced fondly. \"Your Uncle Alonza used to pack for touring the country. He was a crazy one.\" She is at times very consoling. \"Your Uncle Alonza was crazy if a man ever was,\" my father used to say, pursing his lips at mother and shaking his head. \"Your mother's family—' he would begin hopelessly to us, shrugging his shoulders and then, looking very doleful, he would read the paper again. \"The things I could tell you about your father's family—' my mother would always retort. But my father would refuse to be roused from his paper so that we never heard the things my mother could have told us about papa's family if she had only cared to. \"I shall trace our route on the map,\" I said happily. I get very excited when we go on a trip. Even while holding a box of bath towels PANKAPAW and a waffle iron I can be excited about traveling. \"You are going the wrong way on the map,\" said Harvey to me. \"We are going the opposite direction.\" The towns were too far in between, and I could not find the correct highway numbers, so I gave the map to Harvey. It discouraged me also to discover that I began getting thirsty in the exact center of the distance between two towns. I thought it could be psychological, so I quit looking at the map. There were other things to look at anyway. \"Look at all the sagebrush,\" I said to Harvey. \"It will be any time now,\" said Harvey. \"Any time now we should be in Pankapaw.\" We had been traveling all afternoon, and the sun was sinking out beyond the gray sage and purple mountains. We began to look for Pankapaw. We found Pankapaw. We stopped the car. \"Is this Pankapaw?\" called my brother-in-law to a man walking along the street. He said it was. We were here, I guessed. \"Now where?\" We went to the home of the superintendent of schools. He was to take us to our apartment. \"He is out seeing to his milch cows, but we expect him home any time now,\" said his wife. Our two cars with the bed on top pulled up and parked in front of the superintendent's house. Harvey walked up the street. We didn't look at the cars. The superintendent's wife stared at the cars, and then her three children came out and stared. We waited. They had an apartment for us. We carried in the things. It was a very small apartment. The bed, when put up, filled the bedroom. We stood out in the hall and talked after we had unloaded the cars. \"Won't you stay to dinner?\" I said to everyone. Harvey looked at me. The others answered too quickly. They had to get started back; it was very late; they were very tired; they had to get started on the long trip back. \"Well, here we are,\" I said profoundly and cheerfully to Harvey. Harvey was asleep on the bed, surrounded by boxes. I looked out the window. It was dark already. We had been driving all afternoon and were tired. Pankapaw, I murmured, Pankapaw. The night was dark at the window. There was no answer from Pankapaw. T dawn, from a great distance, I heard Harvey's alarm clock. I turned over. Harvey was sitting up in bed looking at a sheet of paper. \"What is it, Harvey?\" I asked. It was just beginning to get light at the window. It was dawn in Pankapaw, cold dawn, and I was tired. \"I am reading my instructions for today,\" answered Harvey. \"We, all the teachers, are to go on a field trip. We are to look at various grazing areas.\" He folded his paper and crawled out of bed. \"Right now?\" I yelled. He turned around. \"Unpack while I am gone.\" The bed was cold and lonely. I stepped over the boxes and went out into the kitchen. I could hear Harvey gargling in the bathroom. Well, anyway, he won't expect any breakfast with this mess about, I thought. I sat on Harvey's old college alligator bag, which was piled on top of the only kitchen chair that I could see. \"Where's breakfast?\" demanded 188 Harvey, poking his soapy head out of the bathroom. I decided that there would be no point in suggesting that we eat out. I got down off the alligator bag. Well, I have plenty of things I can do while he is gone today, I thought. The apartment was very quiet. Perhaps I should look first at the town a bit. I stepped over a box of dishes and the juicer toward the door. It would probably cheer me up to step outside where I could no longer see this—this—I gestured vaguely at the mounds filling our miniature living room. I came back in half an hour. The town is very pretty, I thought. I liked trees and country roads and there was a courthouse clock that struck the hour. There was now nothing left but to unpack. At five o'clock in the afternoon I went down and sat on the front porch to wait for Harvey. Everything was ready for Harvey. He did not come. The wind rustled the autumn leaves, and Pankapaw was a long way from home, and I had seen the whole town in half an hour. I began to feel uncomfortable. At half past five I went upstairs and thought about packing up again. After all, we really didn't know too much about Pankapaw. I turned the heat under the food off and then on again. Perhaps Harvey would not mind if I went home briefly, to visit my parents, I said to myself, while picking out the burned parts of the potatoes and throwing them in the garbage.\n\nI sat down by the living room clock. I began not to like Harvey a great deal. At six o'clock I turned all the burners on the stove off and went down and sat on the front porch again. I could see the Pankapaw High School across the field. It looked deserted and lonely. A lone leaf hurtled across the lawn, orange in the setting sun. \"Harvey,\" I moaned. A truck stopped in front and let Harvey out. Somebody hollered, \"We didn't keep him too long, Mrs. Thompson, did we?\" And then, \"Ha! Hal hal\" floated out. From the inside of the truck. Ha, ha, I thought bitterly. \"No, no,\" I called out. Harvey came up the walk. \"Where have you been?\" I said to Harvey. \"Looking at sagebrush,\" Harvey said. We went up the stairs. \"All day, just looking at sagebrush. Some of it's fenced in and some of it isn't�\" I quit listening to him. Something was smoking in the kitchen. I must have missed a burner. Harvey washed and then he ate and then he lay down on the couch and closed his eyes. \"Harvey,\" I said. \"Harvey, I unpacked.\" \"Yeah,\" said Harvey, and he turned over on his side facing the wall. \"What good does it do to look at sagebrush, Harvey?\" I asked. \"Harvey!\" \"It's all very scientific,\" said Harvey, still with his back to me. He sounded very tired. \"There's a very scientific purpose to the whole thing �I'll tell you about it tomorrow� glub, glub,\" said Harvey. I went into the bathroom and sat on the edge of the bathtub. I felt very bad. I rested my forehead on the cold water faucet and thought about streetcars and trolley cars and taxis and busses and the lovely dinners we had at home. �Glub,� I choked against the faucet. PANKAPAW Harvey came in and sat by me on the bathtub. He put his arm around me, which made me feel worse. \"Glub glub,\" I moaned into the bathtub. \"Do not feel bad,\" said Harvey. \"I will tell you all about the grazing O's of outside of Pankapaw. I will tell you all this scientific stuff, Nitwit.\" Harvey can be very kind and affectionate when he wishes to be.\n\nFOR four days at the crack of dawn Harvey's alarm would ring and I would wake up to find Harvey sitting up in bed reading his typewritten instructions for the day. It is very lonely being the wife of a schoolteacher, I thought. Especially since school has not yet even begun.\n\nAnd then school did begin. I sat on the side of the bathtub watching Harvey tie his tie before the only mirror in our apartment. \"Are you nervous?\" I said to him. He did not answer. He jerked at his tie. \"Do not worry,\" I said. \"Anyway, more than likely none of the students will be larger than you.\" Harvey is quite tall, but still he did not look consoled. Sometimes it is very hard to be a helpmeet kind of wife. \"And you do know a great deal about various things�\"\n\nHarvey patted me on the shoulder, reached for his books, and ran down the stairs. Harvey was a schoolteacher. I ate Harvey's cold toast that he had left and thought about being a school teacher's wife. At eleven o'clock Harvey came running home.\n\n\"The boys have locked some girls in a closet, and we can't get them out.\" He grabbed some keys. \"Goodbye,\" he called, running down the stairs, his tie flying out behind.\n\nI thought about being a schoolteacher.\n\nHarvey was very busy. He had to sponsor the school paper, put on the school play, and help sponsor a class. He was also supposed to teach six classes. \"So many�\" I said. But Harvey was too busy studying to answer me. I went to the library for another armload of books for me to read. I admired the oleander plant in the library, selected my books, lingered, looking at the first stars coming out, and then went up to the tiny apartment, and found Harvey still studying. Sometimes, I thought, life can be very dull.\n\nWe began taking the newspaper from home so that we would not be so homesick. The News came down to Pankapaw on the bus and then had to be delivered after that. We would doze off while waiting for the paper to come. It seemed better to stay awake at night and read it then than to get it in the morning and read it a day late. Once in a while we would take turns staying awake for it. But it usually took both Harvey and me to find it. We had no flashlight, so we would go down where it was time and strike matches. We would search first the length of the porch. One night we found it easily�on the edge of the porch, but usually it was off somewhere among the leaves on the big dark stretch of lawn or in the weeds near the ditch. We would strike matches and hunt for it. We always felt very triumphant when we would finally find it.\n\nIt was while hunting for the paper one night that Harvey told me about the party. \"We are going on a party,\" said Harvey. \"With the senior class,\" said Harvey, \"up the canyon.\" Then we found the paper.\n\nThe next night he came in. \"We have to leave for Pankapaw Canyon in five minutes,\" he said. \"Get ready.\" I looked at the dinner-none of which had turned out badly�and began to hunt for my sweaters and old riding breeches. I was pulling on my pants when the truckload of seniors began to honk and shout down below our window from the street.\n\n\"Come on,\" yelled Harvey.\nI ran down the stairs and tried to look dignified while running for the truck. Harvey boosted me on and the students pulled. We were going in a cement truck that belonged to the father of one of the students. Fine cement floated in the air. I coughed and hung onto Harvey.\n\n\"The wind is certainly strong,\" I said to one of the girls and nearly fell out of the truck. The truck had turned a corner.\n\n\"Nearly lost you that time,\" said the girl.\n\"You certainly did,\" I said.\n\"Stay in the truck,\" said Harvey.\n\"I certainly will,\" I said and hung onto Harvey, seniors, and, now and then, the side of the truck.\n\nPankapaw Canyon had turned orange-brown for fall. It was nearly October. I had forgotten that we had been in Pankapaw a month.\n\n\"We've been here a month,\" I shouted to Harvey.\n\"What?\" he yelled, squinting in the wind.\n\"Beautiful canyon,\" I said.\n\"What?\" he yelled, turning so that his hair blew across his eyes.\n\"Look, pine trees,\" I shouted. And the truck stopped and we got out\nand brushed the dust and cement from us. My knees hurt and I walked toward the hemlock under the pines and aspens to rest.\n\nHARVEY shouted for me to come back, that we were going on a treasure hunt.\n\nWe chose up sides and that was the last I saw of my side. I found the history teacher caught in a thicket on the side of a mountain and helped her get loose. When we got back to the camp, everyone was eating and putting Harvey on the back. His side had won. I sat down by the fire and watched the red bumps rise on my legs from the stinging nettle. Harvey brought me some food.\n\"Not one clue,\" I said to Harvey, \"not one clue did I get a chance to see. I never saw anybody after that first wild shout and scramble except Miss Horne here.\" I looked at Miss Horne. She looked very pale.\nMiss Horne smiled at me. \"We do this several times a year,\" she said.\nHarvey pushed my hot dog at me, and after that I felt fine when the throng came pale yellow and round through the trees, when the sound of the creek bubbled from off in the dark somewhere, and then the students, sitting on logs around the fire, began to sing. They sang the Pankapaw High School song and Harvey held my hand.\n\"Everything is lovely,\" I said to Harvey. \"Perfectly lovely,\" I said looking carefully, listening to the students' sing. And then they gave three cheers for Harvey, and I wanted to stand up and cheer for Harvey, too, but he said to wait until I got home and he pulled me down.\n\"Hurrah,\" I said, anyway, very softly. \"Hurrah for Pankapaw.\" \nPANKAPAW knew I was being carried away and was being slightly sentimental, but I couldn't help it. I did not even mind the cold windy gale of the ride home back down the canyon. \"Hurrah,\" I gasped, swaying on the truck, losing my breath in the wind. \"Hurrah!\" It was our anniversary, I decided the next day. One month in Pankapaw. I bought candles and kept stirring everything on burners turned down as low as they would go. Nothing can happen tonight, I said. I went out looking for something to fill our one vase. Harvey came in and sat down. He did not notice the candles. He did not come out into the kitchen to see what we were going to eat. He did not say anything about it being one month. He took out a check and gave it to me. \"There were a lot of deductions,\" he said. T looked at the check and the deductions. \"Surely are,\" I said. \"They have deducted the money we were going to pay for the rent.\" I looked at my budget. \"Of course, some of it you get back in the end,\" said Harvey. \"Yes,\" I said, looking at my budget. It was not the rent money they could deduct. Maybe it would have to be the food money, or something. 194 \"Mother can send us canned stuff,\" I said. \"I'm best at opening cans.\" I patted the sage decorating our one vase. It was gray-green and looked rather nice in a yellow vase, I thought. From the kitchen window we watched the moon rise. \"Pankapaw has nice moons, anyway,\" said Harvey. I agreed. He reached across the table and held my hand. \"Real nice,\" said Harvey. Someone knocked on the door. It was a student. \"Mr. Thompson, some of the kids are over to the school waiting to rehearse—thought we'd better—\" \"Oh, yes,\" said Harvey. \"Tl be right over.\" He hurried into the bedroom and began putting on his coat. I went over to the typewriter and began to type. I wrote, \"My husband, Harvey, after graduating from college—\" Harvey leaned over my shoulder. \"What are you writing?\" \"It's a story,\" I said, \"about us.\" \"Ts nothing sacred?\" asked my husband, hurrying out the door. I could hear Harvey and the student running down the steps, banging out the hall. I laughed and wrote: \"signed a contract to teach school in Pankapaw—\" \nPARTING Adeline R.

Poulsen\nCHAPTER 2\nSynopsis: Anne Raines, influenced by her sister Della, has persuaded her husband Joe to agree to sell their ranch home. Joe, planning to look for work in the city, leaves the ranch, and Anne, worried over the responsibility of looking after the place, feels a premonition of trouble ahead.\nIT was noon of the next day and Anne stood in the doorway holding a telegram in her hand. The words seemed to melt and fuse together \". . . Joe seriously injured in automobile accident . . . in hospital . . . will write . . . Della.\"\nA flood of tragic experiences crowded the next few days. Joe's condition continued doubtful.\n\nDella rushed back in her car and took Anne and the children to the city, where Anne hovered over her unconscious husband for hours before he even knew her. Then, there were many more hours of anxiety before Joe's condition was considered fairly safe. Even then, he would have to spend months in the hospital.\nAll this Anne had to face, then choose her course. There was no time for regrets or self-sympathy, and there was no time to think about the future. The present required every waking moment.\nBack on the homestead, she went to work, not only milking the cows, caring for the horses, and caring for her garden. With a fierce and sudden pride, she determined to show Joe she could really take care of things. She hardly noticed the passing of time, except to get the brief messages telling of his condition.\nPage 194\nAnne was trying to summarize these rapid events and reduce them to some sort of ordered control as she picked the first green peas from the garden. She was canning them—piles of them; and the corn was coming on promisingly, too. Food, for which she had never lacked in her life, suddenly became a matter of great importance. Millions in the world were starving; besides, with Joe unlikely to work for many months, she forgot about her dream home in town, and began planning where they could remain on the farm during the winter while his broken bones continued to mend, if they had plenty of food stored away, and the cows to give them milk.\nEven Dick and Betsy were becoming useful under her careful guidance.\n\"Momie, I got this row of carrots weeded,\" cried Dick from the bottom of the garden.\n\"Thanks, Darling, now you can rest awhile.\"\n\"But I don't want to rest. I want to help raise food for the hungry people.\"\nThough she recognized in these words an immediate fulfillment of her own teaching, she was struck with their childish sincerity. Mopping the perspiration from her face, she struggled with a choking feeling in her throat, and a swift vision of little Dickie going off to war some day tortured her.\n\"What did you say, Momie?\" \"Nothing, Darling, but you can weed a little more if you want to.\"\nAt that moment, Betsy came down from the house with jam from her breakfast still on her cheeks. \"Momie, I will pick some weeds,\" she volunteered, her round face serious, and her blue eyes sparkling.\n\"Thanks, Honey. I'm afraid you'll pick the wrong weeds. How would you like to help mother gather peas?\"\n\"Fine!\" Betsy lost no time getting busy.\nA little later, she heard Dick talking angrily, and throwing stones as hard as he could, whereupon she discovered he was after a squirrel he had caught invading the garden.\n\"Momie, come here,\" he finally called urgently. \"The squirrels are eating our cabbages and cauliflowers. Oh, look, they've ruined them!\"\nANNE hurried to the bottom of the garden. A sudden instinctive dread clutched at her heart. So the squirrels were beginning to get bad. She looked back at the wheat, now springing green on the sidehill, after which she inspected the havoc wrought among her cabbages, and began to experience a tragic fear such as she imagined people felt in the presence of an invading army. She met the fiery gaze in her son's eyes, and a shadow crept into her own.\n\"We'll have to fight them, that's all. Get some traps from the granary. I wonder if they've started to bother the wheat. We'll have to set out some poison.\" Anne took off her straw hat and fanned her warm face, then straightened her shoulders. She had a little war all of her own.\nA car came up the road, holding her somewhat spellbound in an effort to see who was arriving. But she failed to recognize the driver until the car stopped in the yard a few feet from her. Then, a tall angular man, with a weatherbeaten face and a hooked nose, got out and came toward her. She recognized Sam Hadfield.\n\"Howdy, Mrs. Raines,\" he greeted stiffly. \"Seems as if you're havin' a pretty tough time of it this summer.\"\n\"Oh, yes, but I can manage all right,\" she replied weakly. She had never liked Hadfield, and now, his sudden appearance seemed to be an ill omen. \"I—I find the squirrels are bothering my garden a little.\"\n\"Well, Mrs. Raines, there's no use of a city woman like you monkeying with a garden, or anything else out in this wilderness. Nothin'll grow in these hills, anyway, except a little bunch grass and enough cattle and sheep to eat it up.\" He came uncomfortably close; his small, deep-set eyes searched hers.\nAnne experienced a feeling of helplessness. \"I can manage,\" she declared.\nHadfield lingered, wavering between embarrassment and an unspoken purpose. Finally he spoke—gruffly. \"I think you'd better pack up and go to the city, where you can take care of Joe. I can take everything over now. I made Joe promise to stay till fall. But now, he's hurt. I want to help all I can.\"\n\"I—I couldn't leave now,\" Anne stammered, realizing for the first time the stark reality of letting someone else take possession. A scowl flitted across Hadfield's face. \"Maybe, Joe didn't tell you everything. You see I've bought the place. I argued Joe into stayin' awhile.\" He grinned impressive and would have taken hold of her arm had she not moved. \"Of course, I ain't puttin' you off—not yet,\" he assured in a tone suggesting irritation and a mild threat. \"I thought you'd be anxious to go.\"\n\"We are staying,\" Anne replied artlessly. Her tone seemed to convey the impression she failed to get the full impact of his meaning, rather than that she was defying him, yet the effect was equally conclusive.\n\"Er, er, well, I'll be going,\" he said lamely. \"But I'll see you later. How's Joe getting along the last you heard?\" \"Very well, thanks. But his legs are both broken, so it'll be a long while before he'll be able to do anything.\" Still, Hadfield was loath to go. He lingered, trying to flatter her with rude compliments and veiled hints concerning the uselessness of her efforts. When he did finally leave, the sun seemed scorching hot, though it was only half way to noon, and the moisture on her face evaporated, leaving her cheeks dry and hot, as she stared at his car until it reached the county road. Dick called her as he came down from the granary with some traps, and little Betsy sidled up to her.\n\"What's the matter, Momie?\" she inquired seeing tears in her mother's eyes. Anne seemed to find no words to answer. A hawk sailed through the clear blue, casting its racing shadow along the edge of the yard, and suddenly reminding her of danger to her small chickens and hens.\n\"Dick! Betsy!\" she suddenly urged. \"Let's chase that hawk away. It might kill some of our chickens.\" She ran up the path, with the children following.\n\nThen, with determined efficiency, she crowded the chicks, which their frightened mothers had already gathered to the best of her ability, in their pens, where she knew they would be safe. Then, suddenly giving way to her feelings, she took the children in her arms and opened the floodgate of her tears. Vaguely, she sensed an approaching crisis with Hadfield, who seemed to believe he had a title to the farm, and suddenly, she realized she had no desire to sell the homestead ever! Della wrote at the end of the week, demanding that Anne prepare to come home at once. \"Get somebody—anybody—to look after the crop. That forsaken place is not for a woman to run single-handed,\" wrote her practical, sympathetic sister. In a way, Anne was hungry to accept the invitation. She wanted so much to be near Joe. She made several attempts to answer the letter, but she tore them up, in the end merely writing a brief note, signifying her determination to stay and take care of the farm. This course seemed right, and that was all that mattered.\n\nJoe was still unable to write, but he sent word to let Hadfield take over. \"I can't let you stay there any longer, Honey,\" he wrote.\nBut Anne wrote back: \"Don't worry about me, Darling. Your job is to get better. I'm doing wonderfully well. You see I can say that since there's no one else here to say it for me. I'm actually learning to like it, and both Dickie and Betsy are becoming real farmers.\"\n\nShe smiled when she mailed the letter, and was still thinking about it that evening as she went up to the hilltop to let the breeze cool her cheeks, while she watched the sun set at the close of what seemed an endless day. It seemed as if Joe was beside her; she could hear his voice as if he had sounded the evening she had seen him give up his last effort to cling to the homestead.\n\nHad she been right? Yes, she reflected. We simply can't spend our lives here, entirely. Yet, as she looked out into the fathomless gloaming, she knew now she loved every inch of the rough acres they had toiled to subdue, and the thought of turning them over to an unsympathetic stranger was equally heartbreaking. Why do decisions have to be so far-reaching? Why can't life offer more compromises? she cried in anguish.\n\nA mourning dove cooed in a distant hollow; she turned and walked down the dusty trail toward the house.\nDella finally drove out to the farm. She was amazed to find her sister milking the cows, and little Dick tugging at the pump handle to get some water for the horses. Even Betsy was doing her bit by carrying some of the water to the chickens in a small bucket. Della was even more amazed when she saw Anne turn the cream separator, feed the calves and the pigs, and the horses. She scolded her, and made some real attempts to help, but in neither case was she very successful. She concluded somewhat helplessly that the most surprising thing was Anne's sturdy independence. She seemed to mind the farm less with its backbreaking cares than she had previously done with Joe at home to carry the heaviest part of the work.\n\nBut Della was good at argument. \"You can't stay here another day. I'm going to take you home with me,\" she insisted.\n\"I'm going to stay all summer, and as much longer as necessary to take care of the crops,\" retorted Anne.\n\"Listen here, Girlie, what do you think you are, a regiment of infantry? The hay will have to be cut. Can you cut it? No. The cattle will have to be kept out of the grain. Can you do it? Of course not. And please don't tell me you're going to do the heading and threshing.\" Della ended her recital of difficulties with a devastating truth.\n\"Well, anyway, let's go up to the house and get some supper,\" replied Anne mildly, as she completed her chores. \"I think I can still cook.\"\n\nShe felt incapable of winning an argument with her strong-willed sister; but something inside her—something very stubborn and defiant—gave her a feeling of triumph she couldn't express. She had come to think of the farm as a trust left with her. She had grown, also, to feel proud of her gardening, and her shining. She had to admit some of the large responsibilities were still in the future, consequently she still had them to meet. \"You'd be surprised what I can do,\" she finally said, teasingly, as they entered the house. \"Surprised! Maybe you think I'm not already. But enough's enough. You're quitting.\"\n\n\"Aunt\" Delia,\" cried Dick, rushing into the house after a mysterious excursion through the garden and up along the edge of the wheat, \"I'm trapping. I'm cleaning the squirrels out.\"\n\"Ugh,\" Della gasped. \"Surely, you're not letting him—\"\n\"Oh, yes, Dickie's a man now.\"\n\nIn the end Della returned to the city, declaring that she was no longer equal to the task of looking after Anne and the children. Meanwhile, the summer days grew hotter, and the wheat struggled for growth on the hillside, while the lucerne came into bloom in the small field below the ditch. The squirrels began to nibble at the edges of the grain, which immediately responded by turning a sickening yellow; but Anne set out poison and destroyed them. And when the proper time came, she mowed and raked the hay; then hired it stacked. Promising to pay for it when the threshing was done.\n\n\"I'm learning to appreciate the beauty of living close to the good earth,\" she wrote to Della. \"Yes, I'm learning to be a farmer.\" She was gloating over these achievements the morning Sam Hadfield again drove into the yard. \"Well, Mrs. Raines, I see you're sticking it out better than I thought you could. But the worst part's coming. Cattle are driftin' in from the mountains now, and they'll be crowdin' the fences to get into your wheat. Why don't you let me look after it. I'll get it 'cut as soon as possible, then I can let my cattle come right in. I expect to use this place, you know, as a fall pasture.\"\n\nIt took a mighty effort on Anne's part to remain unruffled at this poorly disguised assumption of ownership, yet she steadied herself to meet the issue. \"Have you actually bought this place from my husband, or did you merely make him an offer?\" she inquired as casually as she was able.\n\nHadfield was taken back by this sally, but he was ready for it. \"Why—er—I bought it. That is | paid him a payment on it to bind the bargain. He said he wanted some money to pay on a place in town.\"\n\nAnne felt herself growing faint.\n\n\"Oh, I see.\" Joe hadn't said anything to her about a payment, and she had been under the impression they had merely come to some sort of verbal agreement which could not be considered binding. \"May—may I ask the price agreed on?\" Hadfield, still sitting in his can, tried to dodge the question, but she wouldn't let him. \"I'm paying him ten dollars an acre,\" he blurted. \"Why, that's robbery! It's worth three times that much. I won't agree. I'll fight it.\" Anne was trembling from head to foot, but never in her life before had she been so determined. \"I'm going at once to see Joe about this. We're not going to sell—at all.\" \"You've already sold,\" Hadfield half snarled, driving away. (To be concluded) \n\nSentiment and Sanitation (Continued from page 179)\n\nTo dinner. These dishes were my particular trial because, no matter how far I put them back in the cupboard, they managed to escape occasionally and would show up on the table at the most inopportune times. Yet, regardless of my resolution to send chipped plates and cracked cups to the ash can, as soon as the damage occurred, I kept them around. Do not ask me why.\n\nThen I was explaining to Bob L., as he wiped the dishes for me, about my inability to throw away damaged dishes. \"I would much rather,\" I told him, \"have had that cracked cup that you drank from at dinner (how you happened to get it is beyond me) smashed in a dozen pieces than to have it just slightly cracked.\" \"Would you really like to have the cup broken?\" he asked.\n\nI assured him that I would. Without further ado, he picked it up and solemnly dropped it emphatically to the floor, and then asked, \"Got any more?\"\n\nI had, and before I had time to waver, he had sent two nicked plates, a handleless cream pitcher, and a soup dish, minus an ear, crashing after the tea cup. It takes high resolve and strong nerve to do such a deed, but you have a grand and glorious sense of achievement once the wreckage is cleared away.\n\nNeed I tell you that Bob has a standing invitation to dinner!\n\nEveryone knows that order is heaven's first law, and we struggling housewives can but hope that the law is enforced. In the meantime, we can put \"a little bit of heaven\" in our homes.\n\nTWILIGHT\n\nBeatrice E. Linford\n\nTwilight, that most solemn hour\nWraps all the earth in gray,\nAnd gives all nature time to pause\nBefore the close of day.\nTwilight, when the weary world\nIs straining every power\nTo keep tired eyes from drooping\nBefore the darkened hour,\nIs soft and gray as a blanket,\nSilent as a summer cloud,\nSoothing as a mother's palm\nUpon a child's head, bowed.\n\nTwilight, strange and silent time,\nMakes all the earth akin,\nAnd one may hear the voice of God,\nAnd feel the love therein.\nPage 199\n\nNOTES FROM THE FIELD\n\nMargaret C.

This little girl sews well and contributes her efforts at work meetings. The majority of the members are in the late teens and early twenties. Under the excellent leadership of Sister Hulda Fields, this society has grown and the true spirit of the Relief Society is evident in all of the meetings.\n\nOn October 3, 1947, this Society successfully launched itself into another year. This was in the form of an installation dinner and dance held in the home of Sister Hulda Fields. The program displayed the talent of the women and included a reading, a vocal duet, and a playlet which encouraged activity by depicting the women with the most responsibility at home as the most active in Relief Society, and so learning to live the most rich and full life.\n\nThe women all came dressed in formals, but the party was not too formal to enjoy some lively games following the program. Then came a fine dinner and dance. The general theme throughout was the organization of the first Relief Society according to the plan given by the Prophet Joseph Smith. A historical review of the Chambersburg Branch Relief Society was also presented.\n\n\"This branch has helped two families to help themselves and the members have canned 300 quarts of foodstuffs as their contribution to the Welfare work.\"\n\nThese sisters proudly take their places with the 105,000 members of this great internationally effective Relief Society, modern pioneer women carrying on the work so nobly begun by their pioneer ancestors.\"\n\nNOTES FROM THE FIELD\n\nPhotograph submitted by Elnora M.

But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not. For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised. And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable\" (I Cor. 15:12-19). It is safe to say that all well-informed people now accept without question the historical fact that Jesus, surnamed the Christ, was born in Bethlehem of Judea at the beginning of what is known as the Christian era. There are grave differences of opinion as to who and what he was. Those who accept the Bible as the work of divinely inspired men have little difficulty in showing that his coming was revealed centuries before the event occurred. However, it is doubtful whether, without revelation, the divinity of the Savior can be incontrovertibly proved. The Lord does not work that way. Without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him (Heb. 11:6). No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost (I Cor. 12:3). One having"

    "content": "the gift of the Holy Ghost may know. The Lord and his apostles stated clearly the steps that are necessary for us to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. On the day of Pentecost, when many \"were pricked in their hearts,\" they \"said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do? Then Peter said unto them, Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost\" (Acts 2:37-8). Faith, repentance, and baptism by immersion in water by one having authority must all precede the gift of the Holy Ghost, and therefore, precede the knowledge that Jesus is the Lord. The writer is mindful that the power of the Holy Ghost manifests to faithful seekers the truth concerning God. \"By the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.\" That power works upon us. We feel its convincing influence, but it may depart from us unless we obey the Lawgiver from heaven and take the steps necessary for us to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Page 219 220 We should be always grateful that faith is necessary. Those who find must diligently seek. The reward for diligent search and research is the scientific and reasonable way. Great scientists tell us that prior to the discovery of great truths they have worked earnestly for long periods of time. Suddenly a great truth would come to them as a flood of light. They then proceeded to prove the new idea. That is what the true religionist does. He seeks earnestly for a knowledge of God. He shows his willingness to do the things required of him by obeying God's laws. In solemn and sincere prayer he asks God for a testimony. It works. He finds that for which he is seeking and knows that he has found it. Is it not the better way? Why should we expect that some man will incontrovertibly prove that God lives and that Jesus is our Savior and deny to all the rest of us the joy of seeking and the glorious joy of reward after we have found it? There are only one or two exceptions to this general rule. Cornelius is one notable exception (Acts 10). This was for a purpose and the Lord has revealed in our day that if Cornelius had not later been baptized the Holy Ghost would have departed from him. May We Find and Know? HERE are many facts which may be cited, all of which tend to prove that Jesus of Nazareth was divine. Among these we should probably name first his teachings. Did ever man teach as he taught? A ruler of the Jews said to Jesus, \"We know that thou art a teacher come from God\" (John 3:2).\n\nAnd there were great and marvelous works wrought by the disciples of Jesus, insomuch that they did heal the sick and raise the dead.... And cause the blind to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear, and all manner of miracles did they work among the children of men; and in nothing did they work miracles save it were in the name of Jesus.... And the Lord did prosper them exceedingly in the land; JESUS CHRIST, OUR LORD yea, insomuch that they did build cities again where there had been cities burned.\nAnd it came to pass that there was no contention among all the people, in all the land; but there were mighty miracles wrought among the disciples of Jesus. And it came to pass that there was no contention . . . . in all the land . . . . because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people. And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness; and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God. There were no robbers, nor murderers, neither were there Lamanites, nor any manner of -ites; but they were in one, the children of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God (4 Nephi, 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 15, 16, 17).\nIf a way of life proved practical for two hundred years, who will say that it cannot be made to work?\nThe careful student of the teachings of Jesus comes irresistibly to the conclusion that the only way to save this war-weary world is to adhere to those teachings. Only by living the Master's teachings can peace ever be achieved.\nThis writer was speaking one night in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and quoted the following scripture:\nThink of your brethren like unto yourselves, and be familiar with all and free with your substance, that they may be rich like unto you. But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God. And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them . . . . for the intent to do good— to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted (Jacob 2:17-19).\nAt the close of the meeting a learned man came up and asked the source of the quotation. After reading it, he said: \"If the people of the world would live that law, war would soon be a thing of the past. Selfishness, greed, and envy cause most human suffering than all of the other ills of life combined.\"\nJust now earnest men and women are studying ways of securing universal peace, but they are overlooking the one and only means by which it may be attained. Jesus, the greatest of all teachers, unfolded a gospel plan which, if lived, would bring peace to this world. The crying need of this generation is that people everywhere will study the gospel of the Savior. Dr. Carl F. Eyring has well said:\nThe formula for peace which Jesus offers is not to be ushered in with the boisterous blowing of trumpets or to be heralded by assembled potentates or marching armies, but it is to begin at Jesus so clearly stated, as a leaven which leavens the whole loaf. Permanent peace, as he tells us, must first of all be born and nourished as a way of life in the souls of individual members of his growing kingdom. Peacemakers, then, must be teachers—teachers who are willing to teach the gospel and emulate the method of the Master Teacher (Good Tidings to All People).\nIf nations will follow the Master's teachings a new anthem will be sung: \"Glory to God in the highest and on earth, peace, good will toward men!\" That anthem, if sung under those conditions, would be the sweetest music of all the ages.\nThe Savior's Influence on Human Life\nFollowing his resurrection and in preparation for his leaving them, Jesus gave his apostles detailed instructions:\nGo ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: 222 teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world (Matt. 28:19-20). In obedience to that injunction those apostles gave up everything dear to them and spent their lives teaching people everywhere they went that Jesus is the God of this world. After enduring great hardships and persecution, most of them _ gave their lives as a final testimony of the life, death, and resurrection of the Lord. Hundreds and thousands of their converts did the same thing. Surely those who knew him best believed him divine. We need go no further than the lives of the noble pioneers who came West for the sake of the gospel to find examples of the effect of Christ's teachings upon the human heart. If they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city (Heb. 11:15-16). If we study his personal life, we find exhibition of the noblest in life. \"He went about doing good.\" While miracles are not always proof of divine power, their absence shows lack of that power. The magicians of Egypt imitated, in a small way, the miracles performed by Moses. The careful student, however, notes the difference in power and majesty. The miracles performed by Jesus were all for the blessing and comfort of the people. His was not a \"black art,\" practiced to deceive. He exercised divine power for the comfort and blessing of people.\n\nGo to the grief-stricken mother who has put her trust in God and try to convince her that Jesus is only a great teacher or a great man. She knows better. His divine influence has uplifted her, and she knows it. Read of the experience of Zacchaeus as recorded in Luke, chapter 19, if you doubt the power of Jesus over the human heart. Have not Christian men and women been the greatest benefactors of the human race? Florence Nightingale, the founder of Red Cross work and the hospitalizing of wounded soldiers on battlefields, was a firm believer in Christ and was inspired by His mercy and humanitarianism.\n\nJESUS CHRIST, OUR LORD\n\nThe man who rendered such splendid service in making it possible for every boy and girl in America to get at least a common school education was a devout follower of the Master. Lincoln was changed from a disbeliever to one who believed and trusted the Savior as the greatest power in the universe. Is it possible that all the Christian agencies for good during nearly two thousand years have all been set in motion by a fraud? He said he was God, All of His actions, all of His teachings, the whole scheme of the Christian religion are built on that premise. If you take away the foundation, the building will fall. He cannot be a deceiver and a God at the same time. The two ideas are wholly incompatible.\n\nJesus Was a God\n\nIt is basic in the philosophy of the Latter-day Saints that Jesus created this world. \"The Father gave him power before the earth was created. He became perfect through obedience, service, and sacrifice. We cannot fully understand why, because he was a God, that he should choose to live a human life and die a human death: Such was his choice, however.\" \"All things have been done in the wisdom of Him who knoweth all things.\"\n\nPaul gives us one of the most impressive and all-inclusive testimonies we have concerning Jesus the Christ:\n\nGiving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: In whom we have redemption through His blood, even the forgiveness of sins: who is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of every creature. For by Him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by Him, beginning with Him, the firstborn from the dead that in all things He might have the preeminence. For it pleased the Father (Col. 1:12-19).\n\nTestimonies That Christ Lives\n\nLong before the Lord was born of the virgin Mary, Job said, quoting from the Douay version:\n\nFor I know that my Redeemer liveth, and in the last day I shall rise out of the earth. And I shall be clothed again with my skin, and in my flesh I shall see my God. Whom I myself shall see, and my eyes shall behold, and not another: this my hope is laid up in my bosom.\n\n(Joseph Fielding Smith, Restoration of All Things).\n\nIn this our day, a glorious testimony has been given:\n\nAnd now, after the many testimonies which have been given of Him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of Him: That He lives! For we saw Him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that He is the Only Begotten of the Father—that by Him, and through Him, and of Him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God (D&C 76:22-24).\n\nLatter-day Saints should be deeply grateful for this truth:\n\n\"O the sweet joy this sentence gives, I know that my Redeemer lives.\"\n\nThousands of honest, God-fearing people in the Church solemnly affirm:\n\n\"I know He lives.\"\n\nThe Gift\n\nDorothy Clapp Robinson\n\n\"Uh-huh.\" Gloria did not raise her eyes. In this book Papa had borrowed there were six illustrated pages of horses. Just horses. She could draw everyone of them by heart, if she wanted. She would draw them when Marie gave her pencils back to her. She could draw Starlight, too, by heart, but not very well, for she had never been close enough to him.\n\n\"Gloria, get your nose out of that book; and you can't take it with you.\" Marie stooped impatiently and took the book from the floor. Gloria rolled over on her back.\n\n\"Why don't you go?\" she asked her sister hopefully.\n\n\"Gloria Amold, you are working for Mrs. Horne this afternoon, so you can earn money to buy Papa a birthday present.\"\n\n\"And you will have to hurry if you get the money earned and spent,\" her brother Levi spoke over a huge slice of bread and honey. \"This is his birthday, and it is ten miles to the store.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Marie added, \"this is your very last chance. If you hadn't been so selfish you could have been going with us.\"\n\nNothing she ever did was right; and the old pec'cy pain began gnawing at Gloria's heart so that her breath came fast and hot. She put her fingers in her ears. That always made Marie furious, but because Marie was twelve and the boss while Mama was away she thought she could say anything.\n\nGloria wished she was like Marie, then she wouldn't be having this pain—no, no, she didn't either; but Marie was a worker, and all the valley people said how wonderful she was to take hold.\n\n\"We are going to get him a wide-rimmed straw hat that will keep the sun from his eyes.\" Since Gloria hadn't asked what their present was to be, Marie felt an urge to offer the information.\n\n\"And if we have money enough we will get some work socks,\" Levi added, \"that is, unless you want to get them.\"\n\n\"Work socks—ugh!\" Gloria knew at once she should not have said that, and it did ease her pain a little, but it started Marie again.\n\n\"At least we are getting him something. If I hadn't spoken to Mrs. Horne about work, you wouldn't have anything for him. You don't love him.\"\n\n\"Don't you say that. Don't you dare say that.\" Gloria sprang to her feet.\n\n\"Why—why—I love Papa more than....\"\n\n\"Actions speak louder than words,\" Marie reminded virtuously. \"He spends practically all his money on pencils and drawing pads for you, and you don't want to work one afternoon for him.\"\n\nGloria started to deny that, but stopped short. It was no use. She could never make her sister understand, for no words could tell how she felt about Papa.\n\n\"Let's go.\" Levi had a half-day leave from the harvesting, and he\n\nTHE GIFT\n\nThe horse's head was down, and only the occasional twitching of his tail revealed that there was life in his body. Slowly Gloria went for her bonnet, and more slowly followed her sister to the gate. She wanted to go to town, too. Levi picked up the reins as Marie climbed into the buggy and sat beside him. Gloria watched, but she could not see too well. Her brother clucked to the horse and Marie turned for a last word of warning.\n\n\"Be sure and wash all her dishes, and don't undress the baby.\"\n\nTheir laughter floated back. Undressing the baby was the valley's standing joke. Gloria stood motionless in the dusty road while the sound of the rattling wheels died away and the gathering silence from the fields enveloped her, but no silence was thick enough to smother the sound of that laughter or kind enough to ease the pain in her heart.\n\nWhy did people always laugh at her? No one laughed at Levi or Marie. Undressing the Wilson baby hadn't been a laughing matter at first. The only trouble was that Mrs. Wilson had come home too soon, and she had made a scandal of it.\n\n\"Gloria, why did you undress Buster?\"\n\nMama had demanded. Mrs. Wilson had been standing back of her and that had sharpened Mama's voice.\n\n\"His clothes were ugly.\"\n\nIt hadn't taken that story long to go the rounds, but along with the laughter had gone quick glances and much head shaking. Papa and Mr. Wilson had laughed, too, but not that way. Theirs had been a secret fun chuckle; and for Christmas, Mr. Wilson had given her a box of precious paints. He'd had the store man send all the way to San Francisco for them.\n\nFor that box she would listen to a million laughs. The girl walked slowly, reveling in the feel of brown dust between her bare toes. She followed a winding road up a low hill, and at the top stopped to look over the wonder of the canvas spread for her inspection. The blue mountains, the rolling hills, the weather-stained buildings she could see and those she could not see offered peace, and at once the hurt was gone.\n\nOn the south slope her father was riding the binder, and the falling bundles left a golden trail behind him. As she watched he stopped the team while he stacked the bundles. Helping him would be more fun than washing dishes or tending a baby. Resolutely she put one foot ahead of the other. She must go to the Hornes'. She tried to count the heat waves that shimmered across the hills, but she couldn't, and that was queer. She couldn't draw them either, but they were there and she could see them plain as day.\n\nPhew! It was hot. Quickly, without the pain of deciding, she turned from the road and went down a swale where a grove of quaking aspens marked a patch of grass and shade. Lying on her back, she watched a lazy wind shoo popcorn clouds above the quivering aspen leaves. In the high blue a hawk hung motionless. It was all so beautiful something inside her chest kept swelling and swelling, and she was going to burst if she didn't get her pencils and drawing pad.\n\nShe knew where Marie had hidden them—on the top shelf of the kitchen safe behind Mama's best plates. In some ways Marie was awfully dumb. Wouldn't she be surprised if she came home and found the pencils gone? Gloria could go back for them, if she wanted. She had been four days without them, and tomorrow was a long time away.\n\nShe half rose, and then lay back. Marie was right; she did spend too much time with her pencils. Why couldn't she be like Marie? Why couldn't she be like anyone but herself?\n\nCourse, she was like Papa—some. People laughed at him, too, because he didn't have big barns or good machinery, and because he used words they did not know.\n\nLike pec'cy. When she had asked him what it meant, he had held her close to him for a moment.\n\n\"Peccancy? When did you hear me use it? It could mean a cancer of disintegration, a too-keen sensibility to innuendoes and thinly veiled smiles. It could mean being hurt instead of facing facts.\"\n\nGloria did not understand all the words but she knew exactly what he meant, and she could always tell when the pain was with him.\n\nSometimes when he came in from the fields or from town she could see it on his face, and then she got all tight inside just as she did when Mr. Wilson gave her the paints. How could Marie think she didn't love him? She couldn't explain her love for him; she could only feel it, and Marie could not know feel without words.\n\nShe would do anything for him, anything. She would even give up drawing if he asked, but he wouldn't ask. She sighed and, as if in answer, the quaking aspen bent low, its leaves rustling, just asking to be painted.\n\nShe must have a pencil. She was going home right now and get one. No—no, she would prove to Marie that she did love Papa. Mrs. Hornes' would give her twenty cents for the afternoon. What could she buy for twenty cents? Work socks were two pairs for twenty-five cents. Work socks! She wouldn't be guilty.\n\nWhat could she—oh, no, could anything be more exciting than the way the leaves of that one branch twinkled and danced? One moment they were points of light and the next they were blobs of shadow. If only she could find something as beautiful to give Papa. A horse would be beautiful, and a horse was exactly what he needed.\n\nHe didn't have a riding horse like the other dry-farmers. If she could give him one. Strangers had a three-year-old roan that was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen, except Starlight.\n\nGHE sat up suddenly. If Papa could ride into town on him! Starlight was a wild stallion, a Palomino, that roamed these hills and coaxed the mares away from the farmers. They all hated him, and everyone had had a try at catching him. All but Papa. He would never help when a try was made.\n\nCourse, he didn't have a horse that could keep in sight of the stallion, but she knew he would not try if he did have a horse. Once she had gone to the field to tell him something and had found THE GIFT him on Bald Knob, watching. She had looked, and there, feeding across the valley, was Starlight and—his mares.\n\nThe look on Papa's face had been exactly like the feeling that came with painting. If only she could catch Starlight; but what was the use of wishing. She bet she could lead him if she could get her hands in his mane, but he would never let her get that close; and Strangers would never sell the roan for twenty cents.\n\nThey probably wouldn't even take the twenty cents as a down payment. She would have to think of something else. Likely, she couldn't find another brush. Gloria squirmed as she thought of that present. They were still throwing it up to her—bringing home a sagebrush for a bouquet. She had been down by the river visiting an Indian camp. Her friend, Pete Jim, was walking home with her when they discovered the limb. It was bent and twisted. Back on itself in a way that had immediately reminded her of Papa's brass bowl. The olive-gray leaves, the stringy bark of the sage, and the old country bowl had been made for each other. She and Pete had tugged and twisted and pulled until the limb broke from the main brush. She had carried it very carefully. Once home, Mama had ordered her to throw it away.\n\n\"I have to burn the dirty stuff,\" so please don't give me a bouquet of it.\"\n\n\"But it is beautiful.\" They had laughed, as always, but Papa had caught Marie's arm when she would have thrown it out. He had handled it carefully, almost lovingly.\n\n\"It is beautiful, Glory, and don't let anyone tell you differently—now or ever.\" 227\n\nWith a start Gloria brought her mind back. \"There must be a rancher among these hills who would sell a horse on time; but she still lacked the twenty cents, and it was a cinch no one would let her have a horse without something down. It would almost be easier to catch Starlight.\" She rose slowly to her feet and looked at the winding road. Why didn't it go to the river? \"That was an idea. She might trade for an Indian pony, but first she would have to find the camp, for it had been moved last week. Oh dear!\" Anyway, she would not buy work socks.\n\nLORIA started over the hill, picking her way carefully lest she step on a prickly pear or a sharp stone. A quarter of a mile farther on she came to the road again. Over the brow of the next hill she could see the top of a windmill that marked the Horne ranch. Mrs. Horne would say she was late again and why wasn't she like Marie.\n\nSuddenly a horse came galloping around a turn in the road, followed by a paint pony—Angus Johnson and Pete Jim.\n\n\"Strangers have corralled Starlight,\" Angus yelled as he passed. \"Starlight!\" Pete echoed, lashing his pony from side to side. Gloria froze. Dust swirled about her face and she did not know it. What had Angus said? Strangers had corralled Starlight. Strangers had...\n\nWith a sudden leap, she sped down the road toward home.\n\n\"Strangers have corralled Starlight.\"\n\nThrowing open the kitchen door, she reached into the cupboard for her pencils and pad. Even by cutting over the hills, it was four miles to the Stanger ranch. 228\n\nGloria's face was red and streaked with dust as she came panting into the yard where the stallion was being held. Men of every age, ranchers and dry-farmers, even a few from town, were crowding about and onto a high pole fence.\n\n\"Get back,\" a man spoke rudely as the girl tried to force a way to the top pole. \"Get gone. This is no place for girls.\"\n\n\"That animal is a killer.\" \"Leave me alone!\"\n\nThat animal is a killer. \"Come on, wildcat. Beat it. Go home to your mother.\"\n\nThe man laid his hands on her and would have lifted her to the ground, but just then a hoarse shout went up from the crowd.\n\nThe man turned hurriedly lest he miss something. Gloria sat on the top and nudged her toes between two lower poles. She drew a deep breath.\n\nThere he was. There he was, her Starlight. Never in all the world had there been another like him. He was—unbelievable. Her fingers moved. Surely, smoothly over the paper. Indifferent as to how the stallion had been corralled, indifferent to the sweating, swearing men; only vaguely conscious that men, horseback and on foot, were venturing into the corral and dashing out again; through all the dust and confusion Gloria's attention was on her never-quiet model.\n\nOnce the stallion plunged straight toward her and the fence emptied like magic. When the men climbed back Pete Jim was on one side of her and his father on the other. Then, for one priceless moment, Starlight stood in the center of the corral, his tail high, mane blowing, eyes dilated with terror and challenge.\n\nDon't move, oh, don't move!\n\nLine by line, stroke by stroke, the horse grew on the paper; a horse so perfect in form and arrested movement the Indians lost interest in the live animal. Five minutes more...\n\n\"He's wearing down!\"\n\n\"Watch out, everybody!\"\n\n\"Now is the time to get him!\"\n\n\"Jim Stanger is going in on his roan!\"\n\nGLORIA sensed the tension at the gate. She saw Starlight gather his muscles for the try; she saw him leap; she knew he had scattered the men at the gate and was gone.\n\nA roar of disappointment went up from the crowd. Men flung themselves on their horses and gave chase. The yard was suddenly empty.\n\nGloria sat motionless, except for her arm and hand. She must catch those last lines before the picture faded from her mind. When at last she had finished and, with a tired sigh, raised her eyes, she was alone on the fence except for Pete and his father.\n\nThe older Indian, a braid hanging over each shoulder, pushed back his hat and black eyes looked into blue ones.\n\n\"Good,\" he said shortly, and the girl's tired, reddened face brightened. \"We are camped down by the Narrows,\" Pete told her, as he slid from the fence to follow his father.\n\nThe four miles home were endless. Gradually the fever of creation left the girl, and what she had to face at home loomed unendurable. They would not laugh this time. They would have tight mouths and hard eyes. Papa might.... Oh, Papa, Papa.\n\nHis birthday was nearly over, and she had nothing for him. (Continued on page 283)"

The general board is not unmindful of the fact that the circumstances of some sisters are not such that they can contribute the full amount of the individual quota. For that reason we are publishing the following excerpt from the \"Financial Plan\" as set forth in October 1947: \"This plan is predicated upon our wish, our hope, and our prayer that the money for this new Relief Society building shall be collected, in large part, by the Relief Societies throughout the Church; that every member RELIEF SOCIETY BUILDING NEWS 231 shall participate toward its erection. We want this to be a building for and by Relief Society women. 'To this end, a quota of $5 for each enrolled member has been set as the goal necessary to achieve this objective. However, the general board realizes that there are some members who may not be in a position to make so large a contribution, and it is not intended that any woman shall be burdened beyond her means and, particularly, we are anxious that no member shall be embarrassed if she is not prepared to contribute as much as the assigned quota. Nevertheless, we should like some contribution from each member, be it ever so small.\"\n\nHONEYVILLE (UTAH), BEEHIVE GIRLS CONTRIBUTE TO RELIEF SOCIETY BUILDING FUND\n\nSeated, left to right: Carol Hunsaker and Leota Hunsaker.\nStanding: Nora Harper; Rea Nielsen; Diane Burke.\n\nSister Lois G.

They have all contributed one dollar to the new Relief Society home to be built in Salt Lake City. They not only helped the building fund, but also benefited themselves by filling cell No. 7 in the field of public service for gatherers. The picture was taken last summer in the Salt Lake City Rose Gardens when the group went to see 'The Promised Valley.' They are a very conscientious and active group of bee hive girls, having filled all their requirements and they are preparing to graduate next year as honor bee hive girls.\"\n\nSTAKES WHICH HAVE SENT IN 100% BUILDING QUOTAS\nSouth Idaho Falls Stake (Idaho)\nIdaho Falls Stake (Idaho)\nSan Diego Stake (California)\nWells Stake (Utah)\nTeton Stake (Idaho and Wyoming)\nGranite Stake (Utah)\nNorth Idaho Falls Stake (Idaho)\n\nWELLS STAKE, SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, COMPLETES BUILDING FUND QUOTA\nStake Relief Society President Cacia F.

She opened the front door and saw him leaning against the luxuriant hedge that grew in front of the Allison home.\n\nThe moon was resplendent, silvering the beautiful village of King's Kettle.\nAndrew called excitedly to Jane, \"What a wonderful picture to carry with me to America!\"\n\"Oh, Andrew, are you sure that you know what you are doing? Somehow I just can't feel the same way about it all that you do. So many things can happen over which we have no control—sickness, accidents, and even death.\"\n\nAndrew turned anxiously to Jane. Her worry and fear were astounding to him.\nShe went on, \"Perhaps I'm disappointing you when I tell you that I honestly wish things were just as they were before you joined the Church and made up your mind to go to Utah.\" Her face became serious—far too serious.\n\nThey stood silent for a moment, watching the moon sail in and out among the white clouds, like a silver shuttle weaving its way across the heavens.\n\"Scotland is a sweet country,\" she began speaking again, \"good enough for any man's country. I have heard you say so many times yourself, and yet you are leaving it all.\"\nAndrew turned and studied Jane for a few moments, the childhood sweetheart he had loved for so many years.\n\"Jane, I am sure you do not want me to stay on in Scotland, when the new world offers all the things I want from life—religion, security, a home of my own. I can never have those things here. Can't you understand, dear?\"\n\"But Scotland would give you to me, Andrew,\" she answered wistfully. \"That is all that matters, my darling.\"\n\"The new country will unite us, Jane.\" Andrew was trying hard to explain. \"It won't be long before I can send for you, and then we will always be together in our new home.\"\n\nJane sighed a long, deep sigh.\nAndrew turned and spoke tenderly. \"Don't, Jane. No man is worthy of such devotion, but if a man can be, I am going to be that man.\"\nReassured, Jane looked up and smiled, sunshine bursting through a drift of clouds. She believed him. She had proved him so many times before.\n\n\"Come with me to tell your parents goodbye, before we attend the farewell party. I must get home early tonight to spend some time with mother, and I'll need to rise early if I get the coach in Dumferline tomorrow.\"\n236\n\nA large crowd of friends, neighbors, and relatives were at the Rumgay home the next morning to wish Andrew good luck on his journey. Andrew was busy. He had borrowed a wheelbarrow from the foreman of the mine, where he had been working as cage-hoister. He was packing all of his clothing and books into a large brown kist that had belonged to his father. This was to be placed into the barrow, with his other belongings, and pushed to Dumfriesshire. Andrew loved books. Since he began working, every two pence that could be spared from his pay envelope had gone for the purchase of books. Jane had made several fruitcakes and some shortbread, and was waiting her chance to slip them into the kist unnoticed. Each member of the family came with a gift, something Andrew could use on the way, although it perhaps had cost only a halfpenny. His mother's gift was precious and a complete surprise to her boy. She had taken the fleece of a sheep, washed and carded the wool, and then spun the wool into soft yarn. With this she had knit him under-wear, a sweater, a tam, gloves, and a muffler. Andrew was deeply touched. He thought of Joseph's coat of many colors and knew now just how Joseph must have appreciated it. Taking his mother in his arms, he said, \"Such a mother! And these hands! No others are as beautiful. I remember the day, almost the very hour, that every wrinkle was worn and beaten into them. Someday I hope to soften and adorn them, dear.\" He kissed them tenderly.\n\n\"It isn't easy to leave my loved ones, but while I'm away the weeans will work just a little harder, and be just a little kinder because I'm not here.\"\n\"I am sure they will,\" answered Mrs. Rumgay, drying the fast-falling tears on the hem of her apron.\n\"Don't fret about us, Andrew. We will get along grand while we are apart.\"\n\nAndrew patted her stooped shoulders, lovingly looked at her, then turned back to his work.\n\nJanet Rumgay was quite through with emotional demonstrations. She had patiently endured so many sorrows and hard trials since her husband had died. And there was no other way. Andrew had gone over it with her many times, had fasted and prayed about it, and always received the same answer. He did not wish to be selfish, but it was the one way out for them all. They would soon be together in a new land of opportunity.\n\nAndrew was packed and ready. Jane could see something must be done about the next few minutes. She spoke to Mary, and then pushed the wheelbarrow in through the front door.\n\"Your coach is waiting, Sir. Now, we will bring in the horses.\"\nMary, Andrew's sister, walked around and stood by one of the handles. Jane took her place by the other. Andrew's uncles placed his luggage into the barrow while he began bidding all his loved ones goodbye.\n\n\"Now Pete and Bally, get up,\" Jane shouted.\nThe girls picked up the barrow, pushed it down the stone walk, through the gate, and into the long, QUESTING LIGHTS country lane that would lead them onto the highway to Dumfriesshire. Trying to remember all the loving admonitions and messages he had just heard, Andrew went running down the lane calling to the girls to wait for him.\nWhen he did catch up with them they refused to turn the barrow over to him. They walked the old road together, the road where they had spent so many happy childhood hours and, since they grew older, had often strolled together on moonlit nights, passing to and from church at Dumfriesshire.\n\nYoung Rumgay was quite the Beau Brummel this morning, walking along fully a head taller than his companions. Jane and Mary could not keep their eyes away from him, he was so brave in his new black suit, white shirt, and black tie. He wore his mother's gift—the tam. The girls were breaking a tradition in wearing their Sunday clothes today.\n\nAndrew had noticed it and appreciated the honor. Maybe his going away really meant a great deal to them. Mary looked up at Andrew and gave a quick roguish giggle. \"When I am old and gray and have my grandchildren sitting around me, I shall tell them about today.\" Looking over at her brother, she added, \"I shall tell them that when I was seventeen I walked to Dumferline with their Uncle Andrew, who is now a millionaire in America, and I wore my Sunday clothes. I can see them now, the darlings, inconceivably shocked, and....\" \"Hold on there, Mary,\" Andrew put in, \"tell them I am a faithful Latter-day Saint instead of a millionaire. 237 You've missed the purpose of my going away, my dear.\" \"As you wish, my brother, but they shall be shocked.\" Fourteen miles walking and pushing a wheelbarrow is a trying experience, but no complaints were registered, for parting was at the end of the road. Jane was fine in her new Paisley cashmere, a clear tan background, colored with every delicate tint of spring. Mary's dress was a winecolored alpaca, with fitted basque, circular skirt, and creamy lace collar and cuffs. Both girls wore poke bonnets with ribbon ties. Jane's golden curls were forcing their way out of every curve and ripple of her bonnet.\n\n* * *\n\nAl Dumferline, they were met at the station by a young elder, Hugh Shand, who had been doing home missionary work with Andrew for two years. Now they were emigrating together. Andrew and Jane, with only a little time remaining, left the party and walked down one of the city's most beautiful flagged streets, to an old monastery. \"Scotland's Westminster,\" drew quietly remarked. \"Yes,\" returned Jane, \"so many of the great people of Scotland lie buried here, among them Saint Margaret and Malcolm Canmore. Faithful in life—faithful in death.\" \"These old walls could tell the real romances of Scotland, if they could only speak,\" Andrew responded. \"They were always true and loyal to each other,\" Jane added. \"That seems to be a virtue of the Scotch.\" She turned to Andrew wistfully. 238 \"We will be just as true, won't we?\" \"We will'? Andrew assured her, taking her arm. Jane led Andrew to a stone bench near the old, time-worn wall. \"I must tell you of a dream I had last night. Oh, I know you do not believe in dreams, and do not want to hear me tell them, but this one has kept me worried all day. I dreamed that you and I were in a deep fog, and we could not find one another. I could hear you calling me, and I think you could hear me calling you, but you were always beyond me. I never found you.\" \"The dream was caused by your worry at my going away. Soon, when I have gone, you will get over fretting and the fog will clear away.\" He looked at his watch. It was time they were getting back to the station. Taking Jane's hand, he began running and pulling her after him. They were children again, as they had been in old King's Kettle lane, they reached the station, the coach came to a stop. Andrew caught Jane in his arms and whispered, \"The dearest and most precious sweetheart that a man ever loved, and you will be mine through all eternity.\" He kissed her tenderly, and jumped on the moving coach. Andrew slumped into the first seat he reached. Hugh joined him. Neither spoke. Andrew had known it would be hard to part from Jane, but how hard he had never guessed. He turned and looked out of the window, watched one field and another mile pass by like a dream in a strange panorama. He studied the people about him, strained, work-hardened faces, men, women, and children crowded into the cheap compartment. He spoke to Hugh, \"We little know what lies before us, but all the joy and sweetness of life have been worked out of these good people, the best that live on the earth.\" After awhile Hugh spoke, \"Say, fellow, come out of it and listen to what I have to say.\" He shook Andrew and began laughing at the mood they found themselves in. \"Say, let's forget it. Father was telling me last night of another Andrew who left Dumferline, sometime ago.\" \"Who was it?\" Andrew began showing some interest. \"Did he belong to the Church?\" \"No. His name was Andrew Carnegie. He left and went to America to make money. He was doing all right here, but he could make it faster over there. Lots of men make fortunes over there.\" Both boys became silent for a time. Andrew spoke first. \"My fortune, I hope, will be in spiritual values. I shall be content to live with the people of God, own my own home, and have enough to make my loved ones secure.\" \"That's the way I feel, Rumgay.\" \"It will be wonderful to be with those who love the things that I love, whose ideals and principles are those I have learned are true. They will by my people and my fortune.\" They traveled mile after mile, station after station, city after city, until they came to Liverpool. \"Change cars for America,\" Hugh shouted, picking up his suitcase. \"Yes,\" returned Andrew with enthusiasm, \"Zion, we are coming!\" (To be continued)"

    "content": "A New Stove for Mother Norma Wrathall that balmy autumn day, October first, mother's birthday, things might have been different if the Center City bus had arrived a little later than schedule, or if Harry had phoned earlier than he did. It was nearly noon, and we three girls had been at mother's old home since five that morning. Kate, the eldest of us, always laughs when I say girls, for we're all on the best side of forty. Kate and I were working like fury, putting the finishing touches on mother's apartment before her arrival on the bus, and Em was polishing the stove. \"T must say,\" she grumbled, pushing her damp gray hair back with one smudged hand, \"these old-fashioned stoves might be wonderful to cook on, such a big top, and all, and maybe mother never would get used to a modern one; but they're miserable things to clean.\" \"It was your own idea, Em, you know it was,\" retorted Kate. \"Dot and I wanted to get her a new white enameled range, but you said....\" \"Mother will be pleased as punch,\" I interrupted quickly. \"You know what store she has always set by her old things. It's lucky she didn't sell anything when she went to Center City to live with Aunt Celia, even though it looked, at the time, as if the arrangement might be permanent.\" \"It was a funny thing, though,\" Kate mused, \"Mother kept all her other things—warned us to store everything, not sell a thing—but she Page 240 gave her stove to that man who used to go around fixing lawn mowers.\n\nHe had a wife and seven children, and he told Mother, that fall when she moved, that he didn't have a stove good enough to last the winter. So Mother gave him her old Kitchen Queen; didn't even ask him to do any work in return for it.\" \"Yes, it's the only improvident thing I've ever known Mother to do,\" said Em, \"but she may have regretted it. I remember, she said to me, at the time, 'Sometimes, when I think of giving my stove to that poor man, I feel almost guilty.'\" \"That's what I think,\" I agreed. '\"Mother's good heart got the best of her judgment. Later, when she thought of how she'd had the stove ever since she was married, she felt sort of sentimental about having given it away.\" \n\nAS I placed the ornaments on the whatnot which Pa had carved from native wood so many years ago, I was thinking of how nice it was that Mother could come back here to live. She had moved out to Center City to live with her sister Celia, soon after Harry left to join the navy. He was one of the first to go, two years before the war actually started, so it had been several years since he left. Mother had felt that she couldn't keep up the big place, and Aunt Celia being alone at the time, they had decided to combine households.\n\nHarry is the son of our only brother, who was killed in World War I. His young wife at that time was living here at the old home with Mother, but a few months after the baby was born, she skipped off with another man, leaving the infant Harry with a note pinned to him, leaving him for Mother to care for. Mother already had a load of sorrow, for Pa had died suddenly a few years back, so I guess Harry filled a need in her life. As he grew up, there was always a strong bond of affection between them. But she was strict with him.\n\nWhy, I remember how, when he was just a little tad, he used to carry water, and coal, and wood. Mother rented out the farm, but even so her income was small, so she saved and made over everything she could. That may have been one reason she took such good care of her furniture. In later years, she was offered a good price for some pieces, such as her spool bed, the old-fashioned highboy, and the grandfather's clock, but she wouldn't part with any of them.\n\nWhen Harry came back from World War II, he said at once that he was going to take his G. I. Money and the savings he had, and fix up the old home for Mother. He said he knew she wasn't really happy living in someone else's house. So he had the rambling old house remodeled into a duplex, with new plumbing and a furnace. Mother was to have one apartment, and rent the other. Harry would stay there with her, and go back and forth to his work in an electrical supply factory.\n\nThus it was that on her birthday, she was to come home. We had planned a little party for her, open 241 house for her friends during the afternoon. Since Em's house is the closest to Mother's, we had the lunch ready there, to bring over at the last minute. We had planned the whole thing about two weeks earlier, while we were at Em's place one afternoon, helping her tie a quilt.\n\nKK FE were trying to think what to get for Mother's birthday present. Harry had already spent so much that we felt we should get something special. Kate was saying that about the only thing Mother lacked was a cook stove. If the three of us went in together, it wouldn't be too expensive. \"But how would a new white-enameled range look in here with all these fine old pieces?\" demanded Em. \"Besides, I think Mother would never want to cook on anything but a Kitchen Queen range. You both know how she took such pride in it, polishing it every morning, no matter what. Remember how she used to tell us, 'the stove and the floor, girls; that's what people notice first.'\" \n\nKate was a little doubtful. \"Mother took pride in keeping everything clean, as far as that goes. And I don't know....\" But Em and I won her over. To us, our happiest childhood memories were blended with the great black range, the firelight glowing around the rims of the lids on winter evenings, the warmth from the open oven door on shivery mornings. I can remember coming home from school, stiff with cold, and warming my spread-out fingers over the range.\n\nAs we sat there talking, Harry came breezing in. Even as a little boy he'd had an irritating habit of barging in, just when you were talking about something. But if you said a word, he'd cock one eyebrow, and stay right there. \"Hi, Aunts,\" he said, helping himself to one of Em's oatmeal cookies, \"what's the big discussion?\" I explained carefully that we were planning a little surprise for Mother's birthday. But I wouldn't tell him what it was.\n\n\"Think you should let me help with it,\" he insisted. \"After all, she's been Mother, Father, and Gramma, all rolled into one, to me. And besides, I know just what she wants.\" Kate said patiently, \"Not this time, Harry. You've done enough already. And perhaps we understand old people a little better than you do. You could just get her some flowers, or something.\"\n\nHarry kept right on insisting, until he'd finished all the cookies. He said he certainly understood old people, especially Gramma. What about that time he took her over to Center City to a show, and bought her a new hat for Christmas, when we'd suggested house slippers? But we were firm with him, and he left, not knowing what we intended to get.\n\nAS it turned out, maybe we should have taken him into our confidence. It was the night before Mother's birthday before we could get the range installed, because Em had such a time finding one; it seemed the company had stopped making them some time before the war. Em's husband, Jim, and a neighbor, put the stove up. Harry had gone out of town on business for his firm for a day or two, which made it all the easier to keep the secret.\n\nBut by the morning of October first, he still hadn't come back, and we hoped he hadn't been delayed. Mother would be terribly disappointed if he wasn't home to welcome her. Em put the can of Shining Sun stove polish on the warming oven—it was the kind Mother had always used—and gave a few extra touches to the nickel trimming on the stove. She was standing on newspapers, because I had waxed the linoleum.\n\nWell, what do you think of it?\" _ She stepped back to admire her work, Kate put the blue willow-ware pitcher up into the cupboard, and climbed down from her chair before answering. \"Well, it's in good shape,\" she said, after a moment. \"But it's so black looking.\" \"Black, of course it's black,\" I said hastily. Em was warm and tired. \"But oh, doesn't it remind you of school mornings, when Mother would stand there, frying hot cakes for us? And that blue pitcher full of syrup on the warming oven—so the syrup would pour easily.\" I could almost see Mother, her tall, spare figure bent over the griddle, a clean, faded apron tied around her waist. \"I can just about taste those hot cakes—melted butter on them, too,\" sighed Kate. \"And can either of you, for all your electric ranges, bake bread like Mother's?\" \"No,\" admitted Em. \"And I have never been able to bake a decent batch of popovers. As soon as A NEW STOVE FOR MOTHER Mother gets settled, I'm coming over and hint strongly for popovers.\" Kate said, \"How that stove takes me back! Don't you remember, when we were little, and the threshers were there for dinner? My, those were the meals! Meat and potatoes and vegetables, and two desserts.\" \"Yes, and popping corn on winter evenings,\" said Em. She was at the sink washing her hands. I began gathering the newspapers from the floor. It was nearly bus time. I wish Harry would come,\" said Kate. Do you think we should have told him about the stove?\" \"No need to; surely we could do this much ourselves,\" I answered. Yes then, the phone rang, and Em went into the hall to answer it. I heard her saying, \"But Harry! Why didn't you tell us? Oh, dear, goodness knows what we'll do now...!\" Before I could ask her what was the matter, Kate had run to the front door. \"It's Mother—the bus is here!\" she cried, and the next instant we were all at the door. Mother stood there smiling, looking so nice in the new print dress she'd made herself, and wearing her little straw hat. She never would wear her felt hat until winter had set in. She exclaimed over everything as we led her through the rooms. \"Oh, it's all so nice, real nice,\" she kept saying. \"But where is Harry?\" \"Oh, he'll be along,\" said Em, vaguely. \"He phoned, and....\" She didn't finish the sentence. Kate had tied a handkerchief over Mother's eyes, and was leading her into the kitchen. \"This is the best surprise of all,\" she said. 243 We stood around smiling, as Kate removed the blindfold. Mother didn't notice the stove at first, because her back was toward it. Her cheeks were pink with pleasure, and her eyes misted as she saw the crisp red-and-white dotted swiss curtains at the sparkling windows, the familiar ornaments on her own corner shelves, the dishes, shining through the glass doors of the cupboard. There was a bowl of chrysanthemums on the table, and her own round, rag rugs on the floor. It looked so comfortable and homey, you could almost smell the homemade bread baking. Then Mother turned around and saw the stove. I have seen Mother happy, and sad, and even angry, at times. But the look on her face was a mixture of all these, plus amazement. A dull red replaced the flush of pleasure in her cheeks. Tears came into her eyes. But I think we all knew that they were not tears of happiness. \"Girls—is this my old stove?\" she asked, at last. Em swallowed. \"Why, no, Mother. It's a newer one, just like yours. I—that is, we thought....\" Her voice seemed to fail. Em had an odd look on her face. Kate faltered, \"We thought you'd like it, to remind you of old times....\" I couldn't say a word. After a pause, Mother said, in a dull voice, \"It does. Yes, it reminds me of old times. Times that managed somehow to be happy in spite of it.\" She cleared her throat. \"It's funny, how something like that stove can take you back. All the years I stood over it in the heat, cooking and baking and putting up fruit, and the summers, when there were threshers and hay hands to cook for. And getting up early to take out the soot and ashes, after Pa died and wasn't here to help me. And blacking the old thing every morning of the world before the fire was made! There was a place in the grate where the fire would fall out, and the oven get cold if you didn't place the fuel just right.\" MOTHER made a little helpless gesture with her hands, and sat down in her rocking chair. \"Then she said, gently, \"There, now. I shouldn't have said that. But it took me so by surprise—I thought it was the same one, after I'd thought I was rid—that is, it's been so many years. My goodness, I know how hard you've all worked to make things nice for me. And you'll never, never, know how wonderful it is to be home again. Don't let anyone ever tell you there's a place on earth like home! I appreciate all you've done, and the money that's been spent—all my lovely old things, kept just like new.\" She gave a little laugh. \"You girls will have to forgive me. I guess there's nothing like an old stove, to bring out the worst in a woman's nature.\" Her words echoed away into the silence. I tried to say that, of course, we could take the stove back. But I couldn't get the words past the lump in my throat. All at once, I knew just how she felt. To see that great black stove, and all that work starting over again. As Kate pointed out later, it's fine to revere the past, but you don't have to live in it. For once, it was a relief when Harry came bouncing in. \"Hi, everybody. Well, look who's here!\" He leaned over, and gave Mother a resounding kiss. \"Why are all of you so quiet? And why did you put that stove up in here? I thought we were going to put it on the back porch.\" He was standing near me, and kicked me, hard, on the ankle. Mother began, \"Now, I've made a mistake....\" \"Never mind that,\" laughed Har- \"Come out to the front porch, and see how you like your birthday present.\" \"You mean there's something else? What is it, dear?\" \"Oh, just some flowers.\" winked at Kate. As we all trouped out, he stepped back, and hissed into my ear, \"Lucky Jim told me in time. Maybe after this....\" He had bought her some flowers, all right. A dozen long-stemmed American Beauty roses. And they were lying on top of a brand new electric range. Mother's face was radiant. \"Oh, Harry—\" she choked. \"An electric stove! After all these years! Oh, you shouldn't have!\" She covered her face with her hands. \"Why, sure, Gramma. There, there, now.\n\nYou're not going to cry, are you? On your birthday?\" He put his arm around her, and pulled a handkerchief from his pocket. Somehow, we three made our way back into the house. \"We'd better go over to Em's and get the lunch,\" Harry muttered to Kate. As I followed Em out the back door, I saw she had something hidden under her apron. It was the can of black stove polish.\n\nMORE THAN LOVE\nGrace Sayre\n\nMusic is song on a silver night.\nSunlight over a brook's mossed stones,\nBeads on the air in a slant of rain,\nA meadow lark's liquid tones.\nMusic is petaled bloom adrift,\nFragrance of summer's mystic white.\nWhispers of gladness, shadow of pain.\nClouds of the darkness, glories of light.\nMusic is more than love can spill\nIn overflowing of joy and song.\nMusic is more than the heart can hold.\nAnd more than love, the whole day long.\n\nUNTIL THEY RISE\nLeRoy Burke Meagher\n\nI shall weep when Easter comes,\nThough Christ shall rise again.\nIn tabernacles of the hearts\nOf all believing men.\nI shall weep for doubting ones\nWho long have sepulchered\nTheir faith in worldly deeds beyond\nThe hearing of his word.\nI shall weep until all men's\nHosannas shall proclaim\nThey, too, have risen with the Christ\nOn Easter, in his name.\n\nSixty Years Ago\nExcerpts from the Woman's Exponent, April 1 and April 15, 1888\n\n\"For the Rights of the Women of Zion and the Rights of the Women of All Nations\"\n\nEVERYDAY WORK\nThe sweetest lives are those to duty wed.\nWhose deeds, both great and small,\nAre close-knit strands of one unbroken thread,\nWhere love ennobles all.\nThe world may sound no trumpets, ring no bells.\nThe Book of Life the shining record tells.\n\nSELECTED POI:\nPlenty of poi and fish, or meat, a grass hut to shelter one from the storms, and the simplest of summer clothing—these are the Hawaiian's necessities.

The root, which is the part eaten, grows to a size not exceeding six inches long, and three inches through. The kalo cannot be raised, pulled and garnered for future use as are most of our temperate vegetables, but has to be used within a month after it is ripe; and after having been gathered, if not cooked immediately, dries and is spoiled.\n\nHOMESPUN\nAPRIL CONFERENCE: On Sunday afternoon, April 8, Apostle F. D. Richards presented the authorities of the Church to be voted for. Our late lamented sister, Eliza R. Snow Smith, has been president of the Relief Society ever since its organization in these mountains, and has labored with unexampled diligence for its welfare and advancement. Her death now leaves the organization without a president. Sister Zina D. Young was her first counselor. It is now moved and seconded that she be made president. Sister Young was chosen by unanimous vote.\n\nTHE OLD HOME\nSold! my home—and to a stranger; one who will never know how the heart clung to every stone and board and brick of that old crumbled house, how in its very ruins it was dearer than the palaces of kings. For the years could never tell them and they could never know, all the sunshine, all the gladness, all the sorrow, all the sadness that is woven in our lives in the old sweet precious home.\nOh, the memories! How they all come back again; my eyes are dim, my heart aches, the home is sold and to a stranger.\n\nA.W.C. A WORD TO YOUNG MOTHERS:\nMothers, let me plead with you first to study the future welfare of your children, rather than the present gratification of all their little whims and appetites. If you know what is best for your child, as you, most of all, should do, insist upon obedience to your mature judgment, rather than humor his ignorance, when you know it will be injurious to him. Children are sure to meet with disappointments; they must learn self-denial sometime in their lives, and there is no easier, better time to begin to teach them this severe lesson, than when they are babes at your knee.\n\nM.H.T.\nWISDOM:\nWe should endeavor to purchase the good will of all men, and quarrel with no man needlessly, since any man's love may be useful, and every man's hatred is dangerous.\nI. Barrow\n\nWOMAN'S SPHERE\nRamona W. Cannon\n\n'THE eight women elected this year to the Salt Lake City Council of Women's Hall of Fame are: Mrs. Anna Margaret Belliss, charter president of the council, inaugurator of the city clean-up campaign, advocate of re-forestation of landscape beauty centers. Mrs. Adele Cannon Howells, philanthropist. General President of the L.D.S. Primary organization, a sponsor of the Primary Children's Hospital. Miss Rose Anna Jones, outstanding educator, founder of the nursery school movement in Utah, social worker. Mrs. Cornelia S. Lund, worker in Parent-Teacher Associations for twenty-five years, leader in Salt Lake City Women's Chamber of Commerce fight for smoke abatement.

Mrs. Ruby Hazlet Wiesley, director of the women's division of Utah war bond sales committee, permanent chairman of the council-sponsored international peace garden.\n\nElections are held every five years; service to the community is the basis of choice.\n\nMRS. AGNES OLSEN THOMAS, for nearly twenty-six years leader of the Salt Lake Stake Relief Society chorus, and member of the Tabernacle choir for more than fifty years, passed away January 9. She was almost ninety-one years of age. Her contributions to the musical culture of Utah were invaluable. Although she was the mother of nine children, she still found time to sing at countless funerals—without recompense, and was frequently contralto soloist with the Tabernacle choir. In her native Christiania, now Oslo, Norway, she sang (at a Latter-day Saints Church concert) \"Solveig's Song\" from the Peer Gynt suite by Grieg. This was the song's first public rendition. The choir leader was a member of the Christiania orchestra which was rehearsing Grieg's work. The director of the famous orchestra was in attendance and was very enthusiastic about Miss Olsen's voice.\n\nTACKINANNY is a story by Mrs. Lizzie O. Borgeson White and granddaughter Dianne Olivia White about two little girl friends, one Indian and one white, and their common interest in the story of the Book of Mormon.\nTO be published in the National Anthology of Patriotic Declamation, 1948, is Mrs. Bertha A. Kleinman's poem, \"The Empire of the Free.\" Selected as one of the outstanding poems among 3,000 entries in the Thanksgiving contest of the National Poetry Foundation, it received a merit citation.\n\nIt has a fine, marching rhythm, and sonorous, ringing diction. Page 247 APRIL 1948 NO. 4 The Annual General Church Conference AS the season approaches for calling together the greatest assemblage held on earth—a general conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints—all members have cause to reflect upon the deep significance of the occasion and the great responsibility resting upon the leaders of the Church and upon this people. It is a time appointed for the gathering in of the saints from near and far, to learn the will of the Lord from the lips of his chosen servants during these last days of prophetic import. To one but recently arrived from a distant land, attendance at a great general conference in the Tabernacle is a never-to-be-forgotten experience. Instead of meeting with a mere handful of saints, often under stringent circumstances, he now finds himself crowded into a magnificent and unique edifice made hallowed by the faithfulness and sacrifices of its pioneer builders and the stalwart saints who have succeeded them. He sees those living prophets, seers, and revelators, previously revered names, seated in majesty behind the rising tiers of pulpits. He notices the great center of the building filled with members of the priesthood, leaders in the stakes and missions of the Church.\n\nEven to a regular attendant it is a sight which never fails to thrill and inspire, and as the anthems of Praise to the Lord rise ever higher, accompanied by the deep and mighty tones of the organ, the beholder seems to become a part of heaven on earth. All saints who are privileged to attend a general Church conference should come with broken hearts and contrite spirits, offering themselves as receptive vessels into which may be freely poured 'the blessings, exhortations, injunctions, and commandments pronounced by the living prophets. While this Church has a promise that the gospel will never be given to another people, the tempo at which the will of the Lord may be done on the earth depends, in great measure, upon the faithfulness and obedience of the members of the Church who must prove themselves worthy—instruments in the hands of the Lord that he may speedily accomplish his purposes. Let each saint, then, live by the Master's words, \"Not my will but thine be done,\" and whether or not he can attend a general Church conference in person, let him in reality be a participant through reading, studying, and obeying the words of the prophets as enunciated therein.\n\nBe done on earth as it is in heaven,\" Then will the passing of each general conference mark an increase in the righteousness of the saints. Then can they truly pay \"they will be done on earth as it is in heaven,\" and look forward with eager expectancy to the fulfillment of this prayer on earth. M. C. S.\n\nCongratulations to President Smith On His Birthday, April 4th THE world-wide membership of Relief Society extends birthday greetings to President George Albert Smith on the occasion of his seventy-eighth birthday. We wish him health and happiness and the strength to continue his great work in a world which needs the faith and vision of men of God. People everywhere are seeking for leaders who have the courage and the wisdom to chart a way through the difficulties that beset all countries today. We, as Latter-day Saints, have been given a great leader, a kindly, understanding man, who walks close to his people, and whose lofty spirit is ever in tune with God. May the faith and prayers of the women of the Church be manifest for our dear President and may the coming years bring him comfort and joy in the service he loves.\n\nA New Feature for the Magazine: \"From Near and Far\" makes its first appearance with this issue of the Magazine.

A change in the regulations for memberships in the Mormon Handicraft Gift Shop was adopted by the general board of Relief Society on December 3, 1947, whereby stake and ward memberships will be confined to stake and ward organizations submitting merchandise for sale for the benefit of their own organizations. This new regulation will take effect on expiration of the present memberships. Members of Relief Society, as individuals, will no longer be able to submit articles under the stake and ward memberships but will be required to pay an individual membership fee of $1 annually. To simplify the payment of individual fees, the $1 will be deducted from the first sale of merchandise submitted by the prospective member. This will eliminate the necessity of paying membership fees in advance.\n\nNow We Are Wed Mabel Jones Gabbott Once there were never hours enough To speak our heart's delight, So young in love, we Spun our tale Until dawn tinged the night.

Instead, she went out on the porch and sat in the late daylight on the red porch chair that had been scratched by little feet climbing up and down. It was a relief just to sit for a few minutes with no babies tugging at her skirts and no immediate pressing task. The three smallest children were in bed. Peter and Beth, seven and nine, were playing with a group of neighbor children. Frank had not come home to his evening meal yet, so she had a few minutes before she cleared away the supper things. But she had no heart for anything but just to sit.\nSince before the twins were born a year and a half ago, it seemed she had hardly had a night's sleep without uncomfortable feelings or crying babies. Then there was all the sickness of the past year, tonsils and measles, and little four-year-old Terry's ruptured appendix. Now, with the thoughts of a new one to nurse through cutting teeth and all the other baby hardships, she was filled with self-pity and resentment. Besides, there were all the stories she meant to write some day. How her fingers itched sometimes to tap out on the typewriter some of the things that came and went mystically through her mind while she ironed little dresses and sewed shirt buttons. She had thought, with the children growing older, she might have a chance. But now another baby was coming to take all her time.\nAcross the yard in the early twilight she could see Mrs. Nelson, her newest neighbor, working in her flowers. How carefree she looked, cutting roses, slim in her cool dress with a bright kerchief around her hair. Morning and evening she had time to trim roses or tie up sweet peas. But then, she had no children, never any little dirty faces to wash, or baby food to prepare.\nNow. She was running across the grass to her husband, coming up the walk. Julie bit her lip. She used to run to meet Frank. Now she wondered if she would ever run again. She watched them standing by a half dozen lilies with long, slender stalks. She had seen Mrs. Nelson fuss with them often. She looked at her own shaggy garden. Only today the twins had made the kitten a bed in the middle of her double petunias. They lay mashed and broken, just a ragged mess of leaves and wilted color.\nSuddenly hot tears sprang to her eyes. It was so easy to cry now.\nSHE brushed the tears away and the hair that had fallen over her face. As she did so, her glance reached across the yard again. Mrs. Nelson was looking at her curiously. She was alone, now, holding a bouquet of sweet peas. Since early spring they had lived with only a lane between them, and there had been no more conversation than a few words of greeting. Once the babies had strayed through the gate someone had left open, and she had caught them just before they went into the Nelson's yard. As she had hurried them back, she had caught Mrs. Nelson looking at her strangely.\nAfraid they would get into her flowers, thought Julie. Now Mrs. Nelson was coming toward Julie's own gate with the flowers.\nPage 257\n258\n\nAt the same time Frank came around the house. Julie stood up, a little confused. \"I wondered if you would like a bouquet of flowers,\" Mrs. Nelson asked quietly. \"I didn't think you had any sweet peas.\" Of course she didn't have any! How could she have sweet peas when at the time they should have been planted both babies were cutting teeth, and she could barely get them out of her arms long enough to do the necessary things. \"That is very thoughtful of you,\" Frank was saying. \"You have beautiful flowers, Mrs. Nelson.\" Juice at last found her tongue. \"Oh, yes, of course,\" she said, her face pink. \"I don't have any.\" At that moment Beth and Peter came racing through the gate with laughter and excitement. At sight of the visitor, Beth, always shy, stopped by her father. But Peter, seeing the flowers, pulled down his mother's arm and buried his nose into the blossoms. \"Do you like flowers?\" Mrs. Nelson asked, with an amused smile. \n\n\" Oh, sure,\" he said and turned a somersault which landed his shoe against the visitor's leg so that she stumbled to keep from falling. \"Go into the house!\" Julie spoke sharply, in humiliation. \"I'm so sorry,\" she stammered. \"Oh, that's quite all right,\" said Mrs. Nelson. Then, as Julie still stood embarrassed, she added, \"I think my husband is waiting for me.\" And, turning, she walked quickly down the path. \"Seems to be a pleasant person,\" Frank remarked. Again Julie swallowed the tears back in her throat. \"If I had nothing to do but fuss with flowers, I could be pleasant, too,\" she snapped back at him. Frank looked at her quickly. \"Julie,\" he said, putting his arm around her shoulder, tenderly, \"this isn't like you. I know you are not well. Why don't you go to bed and get some rest?\" \"Rest!\" she retorted. \"Probably one of the babies will fuss all night.\" Then, hating herself for saying it, she turned, leaving him standing baffled and hurt. ER work finished, she stopped again by the typewriter and let her fingers run lightly over the keys. But there was no use to try to think of anything now. You couldn't write stories when your mind was in a turmoil and your body was tired out. She must go to bed and try to get some rest. At the door was dark-haired Beth for a good night kiss. She came to her mother a little hesitantly. Julie kissed her and watched the little girl go to her room, her dark hair bobbing up and down on her neck. She stopped by the door of the room shared by the two boys. Peter had gone to bed without saying good night. Switching on the light, she saw them lying there side by side, Peter and little Terry who had had appendicitis when he was only four. She looked at them a few minutes and then walked slowly to her own room. The little girl, she pulled were so sweet and still so small, too small to be pushed aside by another. \n\nThe next day everything went wrong. Frank had suggested at the breakfast table that she take the children to the carnival that was in town, \"I suppose that would be a pleasure to drag five children around a carnival!\" she had answered impulsively. So he had gone away without saying goodbye, just as Peter had gone to bed without saying good night. All day it had rankled through her mind unpleasantly. Then the twins poured a pitcher of water into the dresser drawer. Peter and little Terry trying to clean up 4 mess of soap suds and glass on the floor. \"What in the world are you doing?\" gasped Julie, with a shudder at the mess. \"But Mother, I was going to do the dishes and all the soap came out at once and when I was going to dip it out with the bottle, it fell and spilled everywhere,\" Peter said. In exasperation she slapped his face soundly. He looked shocked and frightened, and then ran crying into the bedroom. The twins took up the chorus and screamed loudly at the unexpected things happening. Peter slipped silently through the kitchen door, and Beth began fearfully to pick up bits of glass from the floor.\n\nWhen the confusion had subsided, Julie, out on the porch, tried to calm herself. She sat on the scratched chair and folded her hands in her lap. Fence. She watched the bright colors sway and nod gently, her body gradually becoming relaxed. In a few short seconds her thoughts were off and away, past the land of crying babies, broken dishes, and unprepared dinners. In her mind new characters came into existence, walked mistily through new paths, and spoke bits of fascinating conversation. But suddenly they were the wrong words. \"See! See!\" Then tiny muddy fingers caught hers and wrapped themselves around her own. Away flew the land of enchantment on wings of suddenness.\n\nBefore her stood a little girl and a little boy, each with a tall flower clasped in a muddy hand, a tall flower, 4 stem and dangling roots. \"Oh!\" groaned Julie. \"Mrs. Nelson's lilies, the ones she was showing her husband!\" She snatched the flowers quickly from the two little muddy hands that reached vainly into the air. Pushing them away, she started down the porch steps, the two whimpering babies following her.\n\nThis was something that must be explained, apologized for. But how could she make Mrs. Nelson understand that children, something she had never had, could do impossible things. She must have left the gate unfastened herself when she hurried back with the two older children. Oh, what in the world could she say? At the door she rang the bell and waited, the two babies hanging to her skirt with muddy hands.\n\nAt last the door was opened and Mrs. Nelson looked into her face quizzically, then at the lilies, \"My babies—they must have slipped through the gate and, Mrs. Nelson, I am so sorry, they have pulled up your lilies!\" Mrs. Nelson's gaze went from the flowers to the children. \"Oh, so you pulled my flowers,\" she said.\n\nThe two crept farther behind the mother, and Mrs. Nelson laughed. JULIE was thunderstruck. Was she using this way to shame her for the thing her children had done! She put an arm protectingly around each little neck, \"I cannot replace them of course, Mrs. Nelson, but I assure you that they shall not come into your yard any more.\" With a quick gesture she took the babies by the hand, biting her lip to keep back the tears.\n\nBut she was detained by a hand on her shoulder, \"Please do not go.\" Julie looked up into the strange expression. \"I didn't mean to embarrass you. Don't you see, I am not concerned about the flowers? I can have more flowers. I was wondering why you always take your children away from me so soon.\"\n\n\"I know you have a lot to do and cannot always keep track of them.\" Julie could hold back the tears no longer. Dropping on the couch, she buried her face in her hands and cried bitterly, while two scared little children clung to her skirts and whimpered. She heard Mrs. Nelson speaking to them in a quiet voice, felt her take them away gently, and presently she could hear her talking brightly about shoes and cars and airplanes from a magazine that rattled as she turned the pages. Then Julie felt a soft touch on her shoulder. \"Can you tell me what is the matter?\" Julie forgot her restraint. \"It's just that I'm going to have another,\" she said through quivering lips, \"another baby!\" Mrs. Nelson looked at her in astonishment, \"But surely that is nothing to cry about.\" \"But I already have five!\" wailed Julie. \"Five to cook and sew for; I never have any time to do anything for myself.\" \"She wiped the tears away. \"Don't you see, there are things I should like to do too, like you plant flowers. Well, I have always wanted to write stories.\" The words tumbled out, one after another, and suddenly sounded so childish to Julie that she dropped her eyes miserably. Mrs. Nelson was silent. Presently Julie looked at her, but she was staring at the babies now, happily looking at magazines. She said without turning her eyes, \"You know, I would give all the flowers I could ever raise, all the stories in SWEETER THAN ANY STORY in the world, if I could just have one little child like that!\" Julie looked at her in amazement. \"You mean you would like children? I thought....\" \"Yes, I know you thought I didn't want children because they would spoil my flowers. I raise flowers because I cannot raise babies. I can never know what it is to feel my little soft baby in my arms, and feel its tiny hand on my face as I have seen babies do. You,\" she turned and looked at Julie, and the anguish in her face wrenched Julie's heart, \"you have had five babies to cuddle. Now you are going to have another one, but I must go on with my foolish flowers!\" Her eyes were misty, and she wiped them quickly. \"Forgive me,\" she said again. \"I am sorry if I have sounded harsh. I know you are tired. But if I could just make you realize what priceless treasures you have.\" \n\nJULIE was ashamed. She had never been so ashamed in her life before. If it had been a gentle rebuke, she had certainly needed it. Now she saw how foolish she had been acting lately; how unfair she had treated Frank that morning; how irritable she had been with the children. The slim figure sat beside her, and laid her hand on Julie's. \"Why don't you let me help you? It would be a pleasure to watch the children while you have a rest or go to a movie with your husband, and let me help you sew for the new one. What a thrill it would be to make little things for a baby! If you knew how hungry I have been to hold one of your twins, to brush little Jane's curls!\" \n\n261 Julie felt fresh and new. \"Oh, thank you so much, Mrs. Nelson!\" \"My name is Ruth, and let me call you Julie.\" \"Thank you, Ruth.\" Then she remembered it was nearly suppertime. Frank would be home, and she wanted to have something he especially liked. Maybe there was time for an apple pie. \"I'd better be going.\" She stood up and started for the babies. But Ruth caught her hand. \"Please let them stay awhile.\" So she left them, still happy with their magazines. Then, as she came up the steps of the porch, she thought of little Terry. She had punished him because he had tried to help. A sudden need to have his forgiveness awakened in her. She found him on his bed asleep, his little tear-stained face streaked with dirt. His shirt was pulled out, revealing the long appendicitis scar, vivid to her now as a token of remembrance. How could she have scolded him for breaking a bottle of water? What did it matter if he had spilled a dozen bottles of water? How glad, how lucky, she was to have him. She dropped to the bedside and stroked the hair of his head tenderly. \n\nThe child stirred in his sleep, then opened large brown eyes, unknowingly, first, then, seeing his mother's face friendly and close beside his own, he smiled warmly with no trace of past grievances, and gave her a big kiss on the cheek. \"Mother, why are you crying?\" Julie brushed the moisture away. \"Oh, I guess I'm just happy, Terry.\" And she knew that the warmth of her arms around him was all he needed to understand why she cried when she was glad. Then, while she sat with him in her lap, she thought of the stories she meant to write some day. There would be long years ahead when the children would be grown and away in houses of their own, with their own little Terrys. Then she could write stories, and they would be filled with the smiles of little children twining around the heart, with the mischief of twins, and with dark hair bobbing up and down on a shy girl's neck. Oh, they would be sweeter than any other stories! Her thoughts were interrupted by Beth and Peter, who came trooping into the room, glad to find their mother in a happier mood. Then the twins came home, each with a clothespin doll. \"See! See!\" they said joyously, holding out the dolls in chubby hands. \"Mother, read us a story.\" It was Peter, with his tongue in the vacant spot of his upper tooth row. \"Please do,\" put in Beth, and the twins added, \"Tory, Tory,\" as if they knew what a story was. It was here Frank found them when he came home, unheard. Julie looked up and saw joyous relief in his face. \"What is this?\" he said with a grin. \"Daddy, daddy!\" piped the twins racing to reach him first. \"Mother, read us a story,\" announced Beth standing up and straightening her pinafore. \"Yes,\" agreed Julie, \"I was going to make an apple pie, but I read a story.\" \"What I found tonight,\" - said Frank, with his eyes on Julie, \"was sweeter than any story.\"\n\nFROM LOAM OF LEBANON\nDorothy J.

Poulsen\n\nChapter 3 (Conclusion)\n\nJOE opened his eyes and stared unbelievably at Anne, standing near his bed. \"How—when—did you come?\" he gasped.\n\nAnne bent over and kissed him. \"Never mind, dear. I've come; that's all that matters.\"\n\n\"I'm so sorry,\" he said weakly, \"I didn't get you away from there before this happened. It must be terrible for you out there alone with the kiddies. Delia was right. I should never have taken you away from town in the beginning. I'm glad you came. I want you to get Hadfield to take over. He can have the crop for anything he wants to give. You bring the children and come back to your mother's at once. I'll be out again in a couple of months—I hope.\"\n\n\"Joe, will you please stop talking,\" cried Anne, drawing a chair close to his bed in the little white hospital room. \"Why, you're feverish.\"\n\n\"I'm the farmer now, dear, and I'm turning nothing over to Hadfield. What I'm anxious about is what have you turned over to him?\"\n\nJoe looked confused. \"Well, honey, agreed to take what he offered. I could see I had to let the place go, and he was the only one who would give me anything.\"\n\nJoe's face clouded, and he struggled to lift his head.\n\n\"Say, has he been bothering you?\" Anne smiled.\n\n\"Not exactly, but he's going to. He says he gave you a down payment, and now he wants me to leave everything.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, the check. I've never cashed it.\"\n\n\"Can we manage to get along without it?\"\n\n\"You know better than I do, dear.\"\n\n\"Well, we can!\" Anne made up her mind instantly, and felt new strength.\n\n\"Forgive me, dear, for being so impatient. I know now that I don't want to sell the homestead. I've learned to love it.\"\n\nTears and smiles lighted Anne's sensitive face at the same moment, and she struggled under a great emotion.\n\n\"Darling!\" exclaimed Joe, \"do you really mean it?\"\n\nHe tried again to raise himself so that he could look squarely into her sparkling eyes to make sure he had not heard wrong.\n\n\"I know I can make it worth while—if you'll stay a little longer.\"\n\nSuddenly, he fell back on his pillow weakly. \"But Hadfield'll never let it go,\" he murmured in a tone of stark disillusionment.\n\nAnne threw herself down by him and broke into sobs.\n\n\"I'm sorry, so sorry, dear. It's my fault.\"\n\nBack on the homestead in a few days she took up her task again. The heat and drought of the late summer were forcing the wheat toward maturity, yet at the same time driving the ravenous squirrels down from the hills and the fly-pestered cattle along the sagging fences.\n\nFighting the squirrels and keeping back the cattle were like fighting a war. Anne tried to carry out the analogy in her own mind. For the life of her she had never been able to picture the tremendous clashes of two opposing armies. But she did understand, now, the meaning of struggle against elemental forces in nature, and she was learning the strategy of combat.\n\nShe could leave Dick and Betsy playing in the dry creek bed while she lugged a heavy bucket of poisoned oats around the wheat field, criss-crossing through it a half dozen times until her body was wet with perspiration, and her mouth was as dry as cotton. She could also set a broken fence post, tie and tighten a broken strand of barbed wire, even drive the cattle back over the ridge, yelling at them until she was hoarse.\n\nShe could do all this, and more, at the same time worrying lest a snake or a porcupine molest her chickens or her children. Then there was Joe lying in the hospital. The latest reports indicated he might have to have another operation on one of his legs. She often found relief in tears, but she also smiled bravely, and inwardly rejoiced over the discovery of hidden strength in her own nature.\n\nShe laughed and joked with Dickie and Betsy, and made up whimsical little games by which she turned their daily duties into play. She even laughed at her hard, blistered hands and brown face.\n\n\"What would Della say now,\" she wondered.\n\nSuddenly Joe started to write regularly. He had his arm and one of his legs out of the cast, and what was even more wonderful, the threatened second operation was not going to be necessary.\n\n\"Just a little longer,\" he declared, \"and I'll be out. Then you're going to have it easy the rest of your life. I'm already dickering again for the house I hoped to get in the first place. My first act is going to be to get you into it.\"\n\nShe wrote back, without mentioning the house:\n\n\"I went up to the top of the hill last night and let the breeze blow in my face for an hour while I thought of you and watched the lights come on in the valley. Oh, how I wished you were here.\"\n\nA week before the grain was ready to cut, Hadfield rounded up a bunch of his hungry cattle and put them in his dry pasture above the Raines homestead.\n\nAnne woke at dawn to hear the defiant bellowing of a range bull. Before she was out of bed, the crashing of a post and the whining of tight wires, giving way before the impact of heavy bodies, smote her ears. She sprang to her feet and ran outside. At least twenty head of hungry cattle were fanning out at the top of the wheat field, tearing it up in great bunches with their huge mouths and trampling it under foot while a score of others were coming over the ridge, bent on similar destruction.\n\n\"Whoo-oo-oo,\" she cried running up the hill. Halfway through the wheat, she felt her lungs burning from the exertion but kept on.\n\n\"Whoo-oo-oo,\" she cried again, nearing the first animal. \"Get out of here! Sic 'em, get out of here!\"\n\nWhirling her hat in her hand, she attacked the animal with a fury that made her feel capable of tearing it to pieces with her bare hands.\n\nWindy Hilltop\n\nBut the bovine giant merely ran a few paces and turned to look at her with oxlike stolidity as if wondering if she were some new kind of fly or other nuisance. She ran at another of the animals, shouting and clapping her hands. But they merely circled around in the grain, tearing more of it up with their great mouths and wallowing more under their feet.\n\nOthers were pouring in along the edge of the wheat. Anne's temples throbbed, her heartbeat choked her, and she realized with sudden terror that she was on the verge of collapse. But she couldn't stop. Something had to be done.\n\nShe wished blindly she had the power to wave her arm and strike this terrific mass of invading power dead with a single stroke. She was in the midst of the milling herd now, but danger to herself never came to her mind. Once she would have been frightened to death at the more presence of these wild, relentless animals, but at the moment, she was aware only of the havoc they were doing to her precious wheat. She was thinking of the hard work Joe had done, plowing, harrowing and planting it. She remembered the night he had come down to the corral with the dog after finishing the last round. He was as black as a negro, she had said, but as lighthearted as a schoolboy, and she had gone out to meet him in one of her most dissatisfied moods.\n\n\"Whoo-ooo,\" she cried. \"Get out of here!\"\n\nSuddenly, the cattle stirred uneasily, as if the very desperation of her efforts had at last stricken them with fear. In a moment they began moving back out of the grain, starting at first slowly, then breaking to 265 a run.\n\nThen, for the first time, Anne realized a dog was barking and nipping savagely at their heels. Man's voice, too, broke upon the morning stillness, echoing along the ridge like shrill thunder. She saw him ride down the gully, jumping his horse over the sagging wires, and circling around the remnants of the cattle with amazing speed.\n\nOf course it was Hadfield. \"Confound it!\" he yelled, \"I'll be glad when you get this wheat cut. We'll have nothing but trouble now they've found it.\"\n\nHe passed in a flash of speed. This long-limbed, hawklike man in a broad-brimmed hat and high-heeled boots seemed like a character riding directly out of the pages of an adventure story. How could anyone cope with him?\n\nAnne drew her arm over her hot, perspiring face and sank down on a boulder.\n\nA few minutes later, she was aware he had come back. \"When'll Joe be home?\" Hadfield demanded. \"I don't know,\" she said. She looked up, half admiring Hadfield's magnificent strength. She could never have driven the cattle out alone. \"Thanks for helping me,\" she murmured. \"I'll fix the fence,\" he replied, not unkindly.\n\nANNE was numb with weariness when she started down through the wheat, and the morning sunshine was directly in her face. She was nearly down to the house, therefore, before she realized a car had Betsy running from the house. Realized it was time she could bring all her tired faculties to bear on the scene, she not only saw Della but also Joe getting out of the car. Then she found herself running again, her weariness forgotten.\n\nHe came toward her with the help of his cane. \"Oh, Joe, Joe, darling, I'm so glad!\" she cried, almost collapsing in his arms. \"Sweetheart,\" he murmured, holding her tightly. \"This has been terrible for you. But it's all over now. I've bargained for the place in town. We're going to move.\"\n\nAnne braced herself with sudden alertness. \"But darling, the wheat's got to be cut. I've arranged for the headers to come next week. Then of course, you know we've got to thresh. Besides there's a lot of stuff in the garden yet to dig. Why, we've got enough food to last us all winter.\"\n\n\"Honey, I saw you chasing those cattle when we were down in the valley, and I knew what a killing ordeal you were having. I've tried it myself. And I said to Della then, 'Sis, you're right, the meanest thing I ever did was to bring Anne out to this forsaken place.\" Joe's voice quivered. \"But, dear, you're here now. Everything'll be easy. I don't want to leave, not yet. Our job isn't finished here. I'm a changed woman, Joe; I've learned to see so many things your way.\"\n\n\"And I've learned to see things your way,\" protested Joe. \"I guess it was just stupid of me to get so attached to this place.\" They began to follow Della and the children to the house, but before they had gone many steps, they were aware of Hadfield riding into the yard.\n\n\"Hello, Joe,\" he said. \"I'm glad to see you back, and I want to tell you this little wife of yours has sure looked after things.\" Hadfield leaned on the horn of his saddle and looked down into their serious faces. \"I hope your legs are all right.\"\n\n\"They'll be as good as ever in a few more weeks,\" replied Joe.\n\n\"Well, how about the deal?\" Hadfield came to the point. \"Oh, yes, the deal for the place. Well, honestly, Mr. Hadfield, we've decided not to sell for the present, but we'll still give you a chance if we decide to later,\" replied Joe, reaching the decision so quickly he was half-afraid and looked at Anne to see if she approved.\n\n\"That's right,\" said Anne. \"We're going to make ever so many improvements first, however, so we can get a good price for it.\"\n\nHadfield's face clouded. \"I've already made a payment on it, you know.\" \"Oh, yes, the check.\" Joe fumbled in his pocket and finally produced the one evidence of the sale. \"Here it is. You see, I didn't cash it. I was able to make other arrangements for my hospital bill.\" He held it up, but Anne took it and tore it to bits.\n\n\"Mr. Hadfield doesn't want it. His money's all in the bank and everybody's happy,\" Anne laughed impudently, then hysterically, but in a moment she was crying again. \"You won't try to hold us to it, will you?\"\n\nThe scowl on Hadfield's hawklike face broadened into a grin. \"You win,\" he said, \"good luck.\"\n\nTHE sporting wind was cool and soothing when Anne and Joe reached the hilltop to watch the sun go down, and a lone hawk was spreading its wings to cut a true course directly against the current. Hand in hand, they stood silent against the benediction of the sky, surrounded by the vast solitude.\n\n\"How often I pictured this place in my mind when I was lying in the hospital,\" Joe said reflectively. \"And were unhappy to think of losing it,\" prompted Anne.\n\nJoe grinned. \"Yes, I admit it.\"\n\nThey surveyed their rough acres, partly subdued by their toil, and a mutual pride of achievement possessed them. \"Darling,\" said Anne, \"as soon as you were hurt, and I started to feel responsible, I began to love everything here, and with you gone, I began to realize how it bound us together.\"\n\nFervently, he drew her to him. \"Dear, you are wonderful. I don't believe any other man ever had such a heroic little wife. And because of that, your little cottage in town is still going to come true.\" She looked up questioningly.\n\n\"We're about the last of the homesteaders, and we can be thankful to have had such an opportunity. This humble heritage should always be ours and our children's. I have a good trade, and there are still other things I can do in the winter.\n\nAnd, you know, we don't owe anything on this place.\" Anne caught the vision instantly. \"What wonderful summers we'll have here while the children are growing up, and what grand things we'll raise to eat. All our friends in town will be jealous because we have a country home and a city home, too.\" She laughed as the wind blew her golden hair in wisps about her face. Looking up, she saw the hawk make a magnificent dive into the wind. \"Our wings are set right,\" she murmured, putting her lips up to be kissed.\n\nPLEA\nMargaret Jenkins O Savior, thou who suffered all,\nWhen sorrow fills the night,\nHelp us to put our hands in thine\nAnd walk towards the light.\n\nA SIMILE\nLoie M. Beach A baby is like a breath of spring,\nA tiny, sweet, refreshing thing.\nEach day a change, and as it grows,\nIt blossoms like a summer rose.\n\nA New Coat for an Old One\nBlanche N. Coe Would like to convert an old, straight coat into a new, flared model to wear with full, long dresses? By carefully following the directions given in this article, you can perform this transformation. Before you begin the remodeling process, carefully observe the way in which the bottom of the coat is finished so that you can refinish the new one in the same way.\n\nFirst, make a chalk mark around the sleeve halfway between the inside of the elbow joint and the wrist joint. Cut at the chalk mark. (See Diagram A). Carefully press with a damp cloth the pieces you have cut off as you are going to use them later. Open the underarm seam of the sleeve almost to the armhole. Also open the inside seam of the lining of the sleeve almost to the armhole. Remove the padding at the top of the sleeve and at the shoulder and insert the new-style padding for the shoulder. After you have placed pad correctly, put a tailor's mitt in the top of the sleeve and shoulder, cover with a cloth wrung from warm water, and steam-press into shape.\n\nIf the material in your coat won't shrink into a nice shape, the top of the armhole seam can be opened and part of the old sleeve cut out to make it fit the new pad. With a thin piece of tailor's chalk, or a piece of soap, mark the new hemline of the coat evenly, about a quarter of an inch below the finger-tips when the hands are hanging at Page 268 the sides. Use a yardstick so that the bottom of the coat is exactly the same distance from the floor at every point. Cut on the dotted line of the chalk marks. (See Diagram A).\n\nDiagram B represents one of the pieces cut off from each sleeve. From each piece cut a triangle (1.) with which to widen the sleeves (See Diagram C). Make a triangle pattern with paper as long as the arm seam opening and as wide as the goods allows and lay the pattern on the cloth as shown in Diagram B. Sew the flare (triangle) in place as shown in Diagram C, with the wide part of the triangle at the bottom of the sleeve.\n\nOpen the side seams of the coat and lining almost to the armhole. From the piece which you have cut off the bottom of the coat cut two flares, (triangles 2 and 3), to put into the side openings of the coat, one for each side. Also cut the circular pieces (4) to be put in the bottom of each sleeve from this same piece of material. Cut these circles as large as possible. The diagrams (D-1 and D-2) show two ways of doing this.\n\nIf the piece of material cut from the bottom of the coat is sufficiently wide, and the pattern of the material is such that it can be used crosswise, then cut as in Diagram D-1. If the pattern of the material, however, such as a stripe, cannot be used crosswise, then cut as in Diagram D-2.\n\nJoin the pieces carefully, matching the notches of 2 and 3, and press the seams well before joining them to the sides of the coat. Sew the straight side of the triangle to the front seam of the coat. Sew the circles to the bottom of the sleeves (Diagram E). Bind the inside of the circle to form a cuff at the wrist. Press all the seams carefully with a steam iron or with a cloth wrung from warm water.\n\nUse the same pattern and method of cutting and sewing for making the lining into a flare, and for making the new lining for the sleeves. A different material may be needed to line the sleeve circle. You observed the original bottom finish on your old coat. Even the side flares and finish the new coat the same way.\n\nAnd here's your new coat (Diagram F). It's Fun to Make Pie\nVelma N. Simonsen Second Counselor, General Presidency of Relief Society\n\nIT'S fun to make pie, and it is quick and easy if you use a pastry cloth and a rolling pin jacket! These can be purchased in any store, but it is much cheaper to make your own.\n\nBuy a piece of white canvas at any farm store. The canvas comes in various widths from 30 inches to 60 inches. Two-thirds of a yard of the 30-inch canvas will make two pastry cloths. Cut the edges with pinking shears or turn a small narrow hem on the raw edges.\n\nFor the rolling pin jacket buy a small pair of child's white stockings, cut off the feet, and you have two rolling pin jackets. Pull one jacket over the rolling pin. If the stocking is too long turn the ends back in on themselves.\n\nBefore using, work or rub as much flour into the jacket and cloth as they will absorb. Do not leave excess flour on the surface. Also use the cloth and jacket to roll cookies, doughnuts, rolls, noodles, or any rolled dough. With this pastry cloth and rolling pin jacket you can handle a much softer dough as they never stick and the dough to the board and the rolling pin. They also eliminate frequent adding of flour when making pastry, thereby assuring you of lighter and more tender pie crusts.\n\nHave you ever tried hot water pie crust? Here is a never-fail recipe:\n\n1 1/2 cups flour\n1 tsp. baking powder\n1/2 tsp. salt\n1 cup shortening\n1 cup boiling water\n\nPour boiling water over shortening and beat until creamy. Sift in flour, salt, and baking powder. Stir and roll out. Makes 2 crusts.\n\nMany recipes advise chilling in the ice box, but with a pastry cloth this is unnecessary, and warm dough is easier to handle and makes a more flaky crust.\n\nBake at oven temperature suitable for the type and size of the pie, between 400° and 550° F.\n\nThe \"Basic-Seven\" Pattern for Nutrition\nBernice Stookey Linford Iron County, Utah, Home Agent\n\nPHYSICAL health is necessary for mental and spiritual growth and well-being. We eat food primarily for nutrition. Food at best is expensive, but malnutrition is often found in families which spend the most money for food. This may be due to lack of information and poor selection or preparation. Many overweight people are malnourished because they do not have a balanced diet.\n\nA food pattern for health is definitely included in the Word of Wisdom, as well as the harmful effects of the use of liquor, tobacco, tea, coffee, and drug-containing drinks.\n\". . . all wholesome herbs God hath ordained for the constitution, nature, and use of man—Every herb in the season thereof, and every fruit in the season thereof; all these to be used with prudence and thanksgiving. Yea, flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of the air, I, the Lord, have ordained for the use of man with thanksgiving; nevertheless they are to be used sparingly . . . . All grain is ordained for the use of man and of beasts, to be the staff of life, not only for man but for the beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven, and all wild animals that run or creep on the earth (D. & C. 89:10 ff.).\"\n\n\"In the season thereof\" may, in my opinion, refer to natural foods at proper maturity—fresh or properly preserved.\n\nEach day we read warnings written by food specialists urging us to eat more natural foods, not only to ensure health, but to build resistance against disease. Disease always follows or goes hand in hand with hunger, the aftermath of war.\n\nVitamins are vital substances found in natural, fresh, and properly prepared foods. They regulate body processes and build up resistance against disease. \"The destroying angel shall pass by them\"—can this not mean that health could be so fortified that disease germs could be thrown from the body? Vitamin D, so potent in protecting health, is manufactured in the body by exposing the skin to direct sunlight.\n\nFood, \"in the season thereof,\" eaten raw, cooked, canned, or frozen, is rich in vitamins. The cost, in many cases, can be reduced more than 100%, and the food is more wholesome and better flavored if prepared at home. A well-balanced diet, including, each day, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, mineral salts, vitamins, and water will supply body needs without adding synthetic vitamins.\n\nThe following \"basic-seven\" pattern is recommended by the National Food and Nutrition Board. It is recognized as an ideal health pattern. Include some foods from each group in the diet each day.\nMILK AND MILK PRODUCTS\nFluid milk (adults, 1 pint; children, ½ to 1 quart; expectant and nursing mothers, 1 quart)\nIf fluid milk is unavailable or unsafe,\nPage 271 a 1-pint can of evaporated milk or ¼ cup dried milk are equivalent to 1 quart fluid milk. Ice cream and various types of cheese, too, can be used to make up this group—American cheese, and cottage cheese.\n\nGREEN AND YELLOW VEGETABLES (One or more servings)\nCabbage\nBroccoli\nLettuce\nCarrots\nSpinach\nSweet Potatoes\nAsparagus\nYellow squash\nPeas\nPumpkin\nBeans\nYellow turnips\n\nORANGES, TOMATOES, GRAPEFRUIT (One or more servings)\nFresh or canned juices\nRaw cabbage\nRaw vegetables in salad\n\nPOTATOES AND OTHER VEGETABLES AND FRUITS (One or more servings)\nPotatoes (at least once daily)\nGrapes (fresh or canned, frozen beans or dried)\nCauliflower\nBerries\nOnions\nMelons\nCom Cantaloupes\nTurnips\nPeaches\nPears\nDates\nApples\nFigs\nRadishes\nPrunes\n\nMEAT, POULTRY, FISH, ECEs (One serving of meat, poultry, or fish daily)\nOne egg daily (at least four a week)\nDried beans: (an excellent source of calcium, as well as of minerals and protein )\nPeas\nNuts\nPeanut Butter\n\nBREAD, FLOUR AND CEREALS (Enriched or whole-grain)\nBread, or its equivalent at each meal, according to age and energy needs of the individual.\nBUTTER AND FORTIFIED MARGARINE VITAMIN A ADDED\nTwo to three level tablespoons. Serve some with each meal.\nOther animal and vegetable fats as needed.\nSix to eight glasses of water should be included in each daily diet. A glass of warm water taken early in the morning is beneficial.\n'The juice of one half lemon added to the water and taken thirty minutes before breakfast, before any food is taken into the body, is an effective regulator and also corrects bad Families with low incomes may find it impossible to include as much meat, poultry, and butter as desired, but in all diets it is recommended to include liver, heart, or kidney, at least once a week.\nLiver is our most valuable meat. Liver from calves, beef, pork, or sheep is similar in nutritive value. The milder the flavor, the higher the price. Stronger flavored liver may be ground and sage, onion, celery, and bread crumbs added to make liver loaf.\nIf changes must be made because of low income, natural molasses, soybeans, dried beans and peas, peanut butter, and rice—especially brown rice—should be included often. Increase the use of whole grains, as whole-wheat cereals and breads. Serve more fruits and vegetables, fresh, canned, frozen, or dried.\nBut most important, increase milk and milk products. Milk is our most perfect food. It supplies energy, protein, vitamins, and minerals. It is our best insurance against diet deficiencies. It is also our best source of calcium, which is essential for the functioning of every cell in the body, for building teeth, bones, and blood, and for all body processes.\nWhen meat, cheese, and fluid milk are scarce, or unsafe because cows are not properly tested, dried milk can be used. Dried whole milk should be kept under refrigeration, since the fat becomes rancid. Dried skimmed milk may be used in many ways and is very reasonable in price. One half cup of dried milk contains milk solids equal to one quart of fresh milk.\nUse it in creamed soups, breads, gravies, puddings, ice cream, cookies, and add it to cooked YELLOW VEGETABLES. Cereals.\nDried milk has the advantage, too, that an extra amount can be added, if necessary, for protection of health. For cooking, it is much easier and quicker to measure out the amount needed for the recipe, then mix or sift the dried milk with the dry ingredients, instead of putting it in with the moisture, as is usually done in recipes. The particles of milk absorb moisture very slowly; it takes a long time for the milk, if mixed with water, to make a smooth paste, but it can be done quickly by putting milk in a small (Continued on page 285)\n\nTHE \"BASIC SEVEN\" PATTERN FOR NUTRITION\n273\n\nFROM THE FIELD\nMargaret C. Pickering, General Secretary-Treasurer\n\nREGULATIONS GOVERNING THE SUBMITTAL OF MATERIAL FOR \"NOTES FROM THE FIELD\"\n(All notes and photographs are to be submitted through stake and mission Relief Society presidents).\n\nThis section of the Magazine is reserved for narrative reports and pictures of Relief Society activities in the stakes and missions.\n\nIts purpose is threefold: (1) to provide a medium for the exchange of ideas and methods for conducting Relief Society work which have proved successful in some organizations and which may be helpful and stimulating to others; (2) to recognize outstanding or unique accomplishments of Relief Society organizations; (3) to note the progress of Relief Society work in various parts of the world. It is recognized that personal accounts of individuals who have long served Relief Society, or who have otherwise distinguished themselves, are always of great interest, but the space available for \"Notes From the Field\" is so limited in relation to the number of stakes and missions that it must be reserved for reports on the work of the organization rather than that of individuals. Wards and branches desiring to submit reports for publication in \"Notes From the Field\" are requested to send them through the stake or mission presidents. It often happens that one or two wards or branches in a stake or mission will send reports on special activities which are being conducted on a stake-wide or mission-wide basis, and, in such instances, it would be to the advantage of the stake or mission to have the report cover the entire activity in the same issue of the Magazine, with all participating wards or branches represented. Reports and photographs should be submitted as promptly as possible after the events described have taken place in order that they may be published while the activities are still of current interest. Where narrative reports are submitted, with or without accompanying photographs, the name of the stake and ward, or mission and branch, should be given together with the title of the activity reported, the date, and other pertinent data, including the name, address, and position of the person making the report. Pictures which are submitted for publication can be used only if they are clear and distinct and will make good cuts for reproduction. Black and white glossy prints reproduce most satisfactorily. Pictures should have the following information written clearly on the back: Name of stake and ward, or mission and branch Title of picture, stating the activity represented or the purpose Date picture was taken Name, address, and position in Relief Society of person submitting the picture Identification of persons in the picture should be made on the reverse side. Names should be given from left to right, written clearly, and spelled correctly. The given names of the women should be used, not their husbands' names (for instance, Sarah D. Erickson, not Mrs. James Erickson). The positions of the executive officers: president, counselors, and secretary-treasurer If the photograph has reference to some particular activity, such as sewing, visiting teaching, etc., the name of the leader and her position should also be listed. Material submitted for \"Notes From the Field\" should be addressed to the General Secretary-Treasurer of Relief Society, 28 Bishop's Building, Salt Lake City 1, Utah.\n\nPage 274\n\nNOTES FROM THE FIELD\n275 RELIEF SOCIETY BAZAARS, CONVENTIONS, AND OTHER ACTIVITIES\n\nPhotograph submitted by Zelma S.

In commenting upon the activities of our Finnish sisters, President Matis writes: \"From this faraway country the sisters of the Relief Society send their choicest greetings.... We now have four active Relief Society groups in Finland, at Helsinki, Turku, Larsmo, and Jacobstad. All the sisters are willing and anxious to do their part and we are looking forward with a great deal of anticipation.\n\n'Two of the groups held bazaars in December. I admired their spirit to even try with so little material to work with. It is impossible to buy material or yarn of any kind here. The sisters unraveled old sweaters, socks, and shawls which had already been made over several times and remade them. They were happy with their efforts and it was a goal for them to work toward.\"\n\nPhotograph submitted by Naomi Chandler\nWEISER STAKE (IDAHO), SINGING MOTHERS AT STAKE CONFERENCE\n\nTen wards are represented in the miles to practice.

She looked critically at the paper, and for a moment her heart pounded with pride; but even work socks would have been better than nothing. In quick anger, she started to tear the paper across. No-o. No. This was Starlight. Strangers had lost the stallion, but she had him. He could never run away from her. Run away? She could find the Indian camp. The Indians liked her as she was. They wouldn't expect her to earn money, but she couldn't leave Papa, no matter what.)\n\nTHE family was at the supper table when she stumbled into the kitchen, tired and heartsick. Immediately three pairs of eyes were turned toward her. \"Was Mrs. Home late getting home?\" Marie asked. \"I didn't see her in town.\" \"Likely they were at Stangers,\" Levi said. \"I heard they caught Starlight.\" \"See the package Mama sent and Papa likes his hat so well he won't take it off,\" Marie added.\n\nGloria wet her lips with her tongue. The hat was wonderful. Papa cocked his head to one side to show off. The fun in his eyes was more than she could stand. \"Did you lose your tongue?\" Levi demanded, \"I know,\" Marie's voice took on that know-it-all tone. \"She has her pencils. You didn't buy Papa a birthday present, did you?\"\n\nThe old pec'cy pain tightened inside Gloria. Her eyes stung and her heart was broken in two, but she would not let Marie know. \"Course, I brought him something.\" \"Where is it? Why don't you give it to him?\" They all waited. She kept her eyes away from Papa. If only she had found a horse— if only she had tried to find one, but she hadn't remembered.\n\nRonie Johnson Salt LAKE MONUMENT COMPANY Phone 4-4025 186 N Street Opposite Main entrance City Cemetery Salt Lake City"

    "content": "Bright April Margery S. Stewart Visiting teaching for the month would be done. Nora Linden took a deep breath of the sunsplashed autumn air and turned into the walk that led to the very small duplex at the end of the street. She stepped over red toy trucks and scattered blue doll dishes, climbed the steps, and rang the bell. In the glass that decorated the door she could see her face. She noted, with a wry dismay, the lines that ran upward from her eyes and the powdering of gray in her bright, brown hair. She could hear a baby crying inside, and suddenly an older child wailed sharply. Not a propitious moment for a call. But her finger found the bell again. The door was opened by a girl, she was not more than that, who held the knob with one hand, while a wailing baby on her other arm kicked and a little boy of two clutched at her knees and roared in angry grief.\n\nSomewhere beyond the wildly disordered room, a voice shrieked for \"Mommy!\" \"I'm Nora Linden.\" She held out her arms. \"Let me hold the baby, then you can tend to him.\" The girl laid the baby in Nora's arms and knelt beside the boy. She lifted his hand, covered a bruised forefinger with kisses. \"There, darling, there. It will be all tight. See it's all better.\" Nora saw that the girl's hands were shaking. \"Smile, Bobby.\" \"It's broke,\" he said. Ice one more house and her.\n\nShe rose. \"Thank you. My name is Ann Bentley.\" Nora looked at the girl's long, dark hair, at her drawn but still lovely pointed face, her amazingly beautiful eyes, blue and tilted at the corners, at her slim rough hands. \"You were Ann Phillips, weren't you?\" \"Yes.\" \"I went to school with your mother. I remember you, especially when you drove around in that bright red convertible... Most beautiful girl in town.\" \"Most beautiful girl in town?\" The girl's smile was a distorted twist of her lovely mouth. \"Sounds like someone I met... Not me.\" Tears crowded hot and thick down her white cheeks. \"Ann Phillips, the little girl with the large dreams.\"\n\n\"ANN?\" Nora looked helplessly at the girl. \"I'm sorry. It's been... A rugged day.\" She hid her face in the baby's blanket, her young shoulders rocked.\n\nNora led her to a chair, brushed blocks from it, and eased the girl down. She lifted the baby higher on her shoulder. \"I know just what it's like. I've cried many and many a time.\"\n\n\"We have three children,\" she said, \"and we can't take care of them. Three, and our lives are a rotten, quarreling mess.\" \"I know it's a struggle,\" Nora said.\n\n\"Struggle!\" She lifted her face to Nora. \"I can't struggle any more. I'm going to get a divorce.\"\n\n\"No,\" Nora said. \"Please...\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the girl cried. \"Yes and yes and yes! I'm not going to stay home, fight dirt, meals, never on top of any of them, while Ted rides high, having fun, afraid to soil his hands. I won't take it any more.\"\n\nFor the first time, Nora permitted herself a look around the room. It might be a pretty room under the dust and the litter of magazines and the chair filled with unironed clothes.\n\n\"Isn't it a mess? Dotty, my little girl, has been sick for two days, besides I just can't seem to get things organized. I didn't know how to boil water when we were married, and...\" faint laughter touched the words, \"I'm still burning it.\"\n\nShe sat up. \"I'm all right now. I'm sorry I bothered you with my troubles.\" But Nora saw the strain it was for the pale mouth not to tremble, the hands to knot tightly so they could not shake. Exhaustion.\n\nHow well Nora knew the signs. \"Took,\" she said, \"knowing your mother makes me practically an aunt, and you know how aunts are always interfering. First... How long since you've been to town?\"\n\n\"Three weeks.\" \"Good gracious! Well, you pop into the tub and get dressed. Make an appointment to get your hair done tomorrow, make a date for lunch, and right now you'll just have time to meet this Ted of yours for dinner and a show. I'll baby tend.\"\n\n\"But Dotty?\" \"What is it?\" \"A cold.\" \"Tish!\" Nora sniffed. \"Colds run when they see me coming.\" \"But your own family?\" Ann was wavering.\n\nExpertly, Nora fished in the chair load of clothes for a diaper, carried it and the baby to the couch. She folded the dry cloth around the dimpled legs.\n\n\"We just live up the street. I'll call and tell them not to wait for me. There's a casserole dish in the oven.\" \"I can really go?\" Nora watched the delight kindle beauty in the young face. \"Go, child, and don't worry about a thing.\"\n\nWhen Ann had left, Nora made a quick survey of the house and went to work. She changed the linen in the baby's bed under the grave scrutiny of the four-year-old Dotty, who trotted after her in pink pajamas and fluffy blue slippers.\n\n\"You're handsome,\" Dotty said largely. \"Grandmother is handsome too, but she's in California.\" \"What's California?\" Bobby wanted to know. He brought his red chair and thumped it down on the bedroom floor. \"Let's talk about lions.\"\n\nLaughter ran through Nora. \"I... I don't know any lions.\" \"They eat people,\" Dotty prompted, \"to get their vitamins, Daddy says.\"\n\nNora found store cookies and milk, settled the children at the kitchen table, and went downstairs to tackle an overdue wash. She was hanging diapers in a long, neat line when Mrs. Finch, next door, came across the lawn.\n\n\"Whatever are you doing?\" Nora took clothespins out of her mouth. \"Neighboring.\" Mrs. Finch shaded her eyes from the last rays of the sun. Nora watched the thin lips purse and braced herself. \"Honestly, Nora Linden, as if you didn't have work enough of your own! Down here doing the work of a great, strapping girl!\"\n\n\"It's hard,\" Nora said. \"Remember? You were in tears more than once.\" \"Tears? Ever see such a house? Cry night and day.\"\n\n\"So did ours Fiddlesticks! Did you know?\" Nora shook out a nightgown and pinned it on the line. \"There's an answer to it.\"\n\n\"Tell me if you find it,\" Mrs. Finch said acidly, and went in the direction of the house.\n\nNames and problems. Ann's name slipped in... \"Help me to help her, and bless her children I pray....\"\n\nShe finished hanging the clothes, went in and bathed the children and the baby. She fed them and tucked them into smooth, clean beds. The kitchen was a cheerful room, especially when she had washed the floor, and under it the living cushions that brought out the vivid coloring in six Chinese prints.\n\nA slim book of poems lay open on the table. Nora picked it up and read the lines Ann had been reading. Nostalgia stabbed her. \"When I am dead and over me bright April shakes out her rain-drenched hair....\"\n\nWith the familiar lines, came the remembrance of the defenselessness of youth, the intensity and anguish of its loves. She closed the book and put it gently on the shelf.\n\nIt was almost midnight when they came home. Nora, nodding over the mending in her hands, straightened and smoothed her hair. Ann flung open the door. \"Are they all right?\" \"Yes, indeed.\" Nora noted with approval the sparkle in Ann's face, the relaxed curves of her mouth. A tall, young man, with a mop of curly brown hair and a quick, white smile, looked at the place! Why can't this be a daily event?\"\n\nNora watched the laughter die on Ann's lips. She introduced Ted, her voice low.\n\nThe children woke and, hearing voices, sent up a demanding shriek. Ted reached for the evening paper and slid into a chair. \"Quiet them, Ann.\" Nora rose. \"I'll see you along.\"\n\nBe back tomorrow, around twelve.\" 254 Ann came with her to the door. \"Thank you, are such inadequate words.\" \"You're very welcome.\" Nora went eagerly down the steps and up the street toward home. They had all gone to bed. She tiptoed upstairs. Tom, senior, had fallen asleep over a magazine. She took off his glasses, put them on the night table, slid one of the two pillows out from under his head. 'Tom, junior, had taken advantage of her absence to invite Spot upstairs. The puppy's tail thumped in greeting when she tiptoed into his son's room. Carol's long lashes made half-circles on the lovely cheeks. Nora stood over her daughter for a long time. Fifteen... A tender year, fragile and fleet. Nora noted the smooth, slim fingers, no vestige of the stubby childhood hands. Soon they would be a woman's hands. Nora looked around the room, at the dress limp on the floor, the closet door open, shoes spilling out. Carol's lashes fluttered and lifted. \"We had a party, Mother. Bill came. Bill Carlos!\" \"No!\" breathed Nora, with expected enthusiasm and a wild mental groping. \"Oh, yes, the high-school football star. Darling, how wonderful!\" \"Mother, he said he might come again.\" Nora bent and kissed the radiant face, inside the fierce pleading, \"Help me to help her, to show her the way....\" She went downstairs. The kitchen was a shambles. Glasses, plates, silverware stacked helter-skelter on the long tile drainboard. Wearily, she began to gather them up. She thought of Ann and paused. She put the plates she had gathered back in the places where she had found them and marched upstairs into Carol's room. She shook her daughter awake. \"Put on your robe and slippers and come downstairs and clean up that mess.\" Carol sat bolt upright. \"Mother! Are you mad? Dishes this time of night?\" Nora flung back the covers. \"Revolting, isn't it? But I've a new job.\" \"A new job?\" Carol squeaked. She reached for her robe and fumbled about for slippers. \"Mother, what on earth?\" Nora, sitting on the stool by the refrigerator, eating leftover chicken, told her about Ann. \"So I'm going back tomorrow, and when you come home from school you'll have to get dinner... Might as well scrub and wax this floor.\" Carol lifted her hands out of the soapy water. \"But I've never scrubbed a floor in my life.\" \"I know,\" said Nora, \"neither had Ann. It's hard to learn everything at once.\" THE days sped by. Nora saw that she was wearing a path in the lawn where she turned down to go to Ann's house. Now Bobby and Dotty ran to meet her, fighting over her hands. Ann came swiftly to the door, lovely, eager, brimming with gratitude. Nora could not persuade her very often to leave the little house. Ann preferred to follow Nora, watching, listening, asking questions. The little house shone every day. Fragrance poured out of it, bread baking, beans simmering in molasses and mustard, apple pies browning. BRIGHT APRIL 255 her arms frighteningly so. The delicate bones showed in her neck. Was it Ted? Nora made excuses to run over in the evenings. Ann sat alone, mending or reading the thin book of poems. Nora asked, point-blank, one evening. \"Ann bent her head above her mending. 'Ted? He's bowling.' 'He likes sports?' 'Mad about them, baseball, basketball, there's always something going on.' She jabbed the needle through the darning cotton. 'I used to think I couldn't go on if he didn't stay home. Now I'm glad he's gone. Glad. Glad.' \" Nora's heart turned sick. She'd known, of course, that it took two. Not all Ann's effort, her courage, her willingness to learn were enough. Nora remembered Bob, in the early years of their marriage, walking the floor with the babies. He said once that something tangible and lovely came into being between two people who were doing a job together. Nora said, \"I heard Ted used to be tops in scout work when he was a youngster. My sister lives in his old ward.\" Ann shrugged. \"Now I can't get him to go to Church. I'll go alone, take the children. 'They should be learning.' She bent over her work again. Something in the young shoulders, bending so quietly to their task, made tears burn in Nora's throat.

She was awake when the phone rang at three and ran swiftly to answer it before the repeated rings should arouse the household. It was Ann. Dotty was very ill. The doctor was out on call. Would Nora mind coming over? Nora dressed swiftly and ran down the block. A white-faced Ted met her at the door and led her to the children's room. Nora went to Dotty's bed and leaned past Ann. Dotty's face was scarlet, her forehead dry and burning under Nora's hand. Her wheezing was the loudest thing in the room. Ann lifted the thermometer to the light. \"One hundred and four,\" she said. Nora worked swiftly, using all the time-honored remedies. Ann fetched and carried. Ted paced from bedroom to living room window and back. \"That doctor! Him?\" Nora watched him bend over his daughter. He looked very young, with his tousled hair, his shirt open at the neck. The words pushed themselves out of her throat, \"You...

Peace that was almost tangible, and love that swelled Nora's heart until she felt it must break. Ann cried. 'Tears splashed on her hands. Nora looked up at Ted's face. It was very white. He finished and put the bottle on the little table. He went to Ann and took her in his arms, his face hidden in her hair.\nNora reached for her coat. \"I'm going home,\" she said. \"We know that Dotty is going to be well.\" She walked slowly up the street, carrying the wonder, not willing to relinquish a moment of the beauty, marveling at the Father's love his tenderness with boys like Ted... who sometimes lost the way, with him.\nNora turned into her own front door. \"Thank you, for letting me help.\"\nDESCRIPTIVE POETRY\nLYDIA HALL\nAnd there is one who always passes by,\nAs many do, in search of greening fields\nAnd buttercups beneath an azure sky;\nWho thinks he garners nature's richest yields\nBecause he loves a narrow country lane\nWhere lilacs blow; because he lingers where\nSweet grasses feel the silver touch of rain\nAnd pampered roses freight the heavy air.\nHe'll live his long life through and never know\nThe wonder of this desert's blossoming:\n\"These bright-winged things that are like sunset glow\nOr crimson flames that waken in the spring,\nWhen God, more than in any other land,\nFlings loveliness across the arid sand."

V. McNeely\n\nWE live in a changing world—a world that has perhaps changed more during the past fifty years than it did in all the previous 1,000 years. For illustration, let us ask what electricity, gas and oil fuels, motor cars, airplanes, radios, television, and atomic energy have done for our mechanical civilization during the lifetime before fifty years old. And these factors are nothing changes in the field of mechanics! Take, for example, the accompanying changes in our thinking, believing, acting and living. Is not the privilege—if voting hardly responsible for bringing multitudes of women into politics, business, the professions and, unfortunately, vice indulgences to an extent previously unknown? Then, respectable women did not smoke or drink. Now, many of them indulge as freely as men do.\n\nAs a result of all these changes in the fields of mechanics and human lives, the picture of living is greatly different today from what it was then. Is it better or worse? The correct answer depends on the point of view. Mechanically, yes, decidedly. Socially, in some respects, yes, and in others, no. Without question there has been a deterioration in the family life of multitudes of homes. Divorces are far more numerous, juvenile delinquency has multiplied, morality has sunk to lower levels, crimes have increased and faith declined.\n\nIn all of these deteriorations the use of narcotics—particularly alcohol and tobacco—has played an important part.\n\nThe Lord said: \"That inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong drink among you, behold it is not good . . .\" (D. & C. 89:5).\n\nDrink brings cruelty into the home; it walks arm and arm with poverty . . . ; it puts chastity to flight; it knows neither honesty nor fair dealings; it is a total stranger to truth; it drowns conscience; it is the bodyguard of evil; it curses all who touch it. Drink has brought more woe to the city, broken more hearts, wrecked more hopes, and caused more crimes and murders than all the wars (First Presidency, October Conference Message, 1943).\n\nAlcohol paralyzes the inhibitions, renders the physical urges more obvious, disarms the critical faculties, breaks down reasonableness and prudence, blurs finer sense of perception and taste, without necessarily creating the state of intoxication. Alcohol is the best producer known and is responsible for a great part of crime and the promotion of prostitution (Dr. Haven Emerson, in Alcohol—Its Effect on Man, page 82).\n\nNo arguments are needed to establish the truth of the above statements relative to the effects of alcohol. Observation and experience certify to their truth.\n\nAs to the nature of alcohol we may read:\n\nAlcohol is a poison inherently, absolutely. Occasionally, in a drop or in a gallon, in all quantities, it is a poison. Plainly the quantity cannot affect the chemical composition (The Journal American Medical Association).\n\nCocktail Lounges\n\nNow, relative to the participation of women in drinking alcoholic beverages, the records show drinking is alarmingly increasing among them.\n\nBehold, it is not coming; it has come—the cocktail lounge America. I lived through a generation of the saloon. Then, no woman could enter a saloon, embrace the brass rail, and ever live down the disgrace. But I have lived to see a disgrace a thousand fold deeper.\n\nIn some of America's greatest hotels I recently saw a cocktail lounge—I beg your pardon, a Ladies Cocktail Lounge—the largest drinking place I have ever seen in my more than four-score years. The managers told me their average daily customers totaled three thousand. America's death is in that spot.\n\nSome six hundred years before Christ there lived a hero by the name of Jeremah. He said: \"There are among my people wicked men: they set traps, they catch men.\" Were Jeremiah living today he would exclaim: \"What a perfect picture of the liquor hood and all that connotes\" (Dr. Elmer Ellsworth Helms, in The Voice).\n\nKathleen Norris wrote:\n\nFor generations excessive drinking by men has been the curse of helpless womanhood and childhood, has been the creator of want and slums, cruelty and crime. For millions of women and children today this curse has represented the one desperate effort of their lives and the one fervent prayer of their hearts.\n\nIt is a sorrowful thing, it is a bitter reflection upon the code and character of American women today, that this curse is being extended to include them; that thousands of our women—and by no means our poorest women; by no means the women who have sunk to the lowest stage of degradation—are voluntarily placing themselves in the group of the drunkards (Chicago Herald-American, September 28, 1943).\n\nEXPERTS estimate there are in America today three million drunkards—human beings who drink excessively and are frequently, or more less continually, drunk. Of these, there are multitudes of otherwise respectable women—sad, almost too sad to mention, but indicative of how the terrible evil of drinking has grown among the fair sex. During the past ten years the per capita consumption of distilled liquors (whiskies) in the United States increased eighty-five per cent, according to the Distilled Spirits Institute. But the increased consumption among the fair sex during this period is said to be much greater than among men.\n\nAccording to the United States Department of Commerce, nearly nine billion dollars ($8,779,000,000) was paid in this country during 1946 for alcoholic beverages. This is the same period for all types of public and private schools, including school and university libraries, and for state and federal government services in the fields of health, welfare, old age assistance, etc.\n\nNow, if drinking did any good to its consumers, saying nothing of good in some small measure commensurate with the enormous expenditures involved, there might be a little justification for drinking. But there is no justification. Then, in view of the many and varied ills and evils resulting from drinking and of the fact that the vast sums spent for drink are worse than wasted—why do people drink? Let us put the question (inoffensively of course) to any who might drink, why do you drink?\n\nIf you are gracious enough to consider the question and give me an answer, your reply will probably differ more or less from that given by others—but, in the last analysis, it the 366 answers may be consolidated into one—you began and continue to drink because other people drink. 'To a greater or less extent drinking has become fashionable—is believed to be the smart thing to do, especially by those who are ambitious to be socially O.K. Now all of this has come about because Satan and his hosts operate ceaselessly among our Father's children with the objective of leading them away from the path given by the Lord for them to follow if they would please him and experience the joys of living that he has promised them through obedience. \"... Men are, that they might have joy\" (2 Nephi 2:25).... In consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days, I have warmed you, and forewarned you, by giving unto you this word of wisdom by revelation—that inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong drink among you, behold it is not good... (D. & C. 89:4-5). This is a divine truth. Human observations and experiences have verified it over and over again.\n\nNow as to \"evils and designs... In the hearts of conspiring men,\" let us refer to advertising. In a hearing relative to this matter before a committee of the United States Senate in May 1947, Senator Capper said: The national bill in 1946 for alcoholic beverages was nearly nine billion dollars, eighty-nine dollars for every person in the United States over eighteen years old—about one-fourth of the federal budget for the coming year. Now, Mr. Chairman, I believe that the tremendous amount of advertising seeking to whet the appetite for drinking, seeking to create new customers, especially among women and children, has much to do with the greatly increased amount of alcoholic consumption during recent years. It is generally agreed in the business world that advertising is one of the most fruitful means of increasing business and of promoting sales. Certain it is that the vast sums (more than one-hundred million dollars) annually spent for widespread, alluring, deceptive advertising have had much to do with greatly increased consumption of alcoholic beverages during recent years, especially among women and teen-agers.\n\nBut what shall we do about all this?—a simple question for all Latter-day Saints. They know the answer—total abstinence; have nothing to do with the manufacture, sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages —easy to say. Then, why do they indulge? Let each one answer for himself, remembering what the Lord has said relative to the matter. Is it not an admission of weakness or lack of faith for any Latter-day Saint to indulge? Yes, so the men of the world say. Then, does indulgence help or handicap a professed Latter-day Saint in his efforts to win the respect and confidence of non-members? Weaklings or hypocrites are never trusted—never wanted in positions of responsibility. Let every Latter-day Saint remember this, particularly every one ambitious to climb. Moral courage and dependability are among the essential qualities in the lives of professing Church members who would succeed in the business world.\n\nMany examples illustrating the truth of these statements could be recited. But this is needless here, for every observing and experienced faithful member can tell them.\n\nContest Announcements—1948\n\nThe"

    "content": "For Makers of Rhythmic Beauty\nCarlton Culmsee, Ph.D.\nDean, School of Arts and Sciences, Utah State Agricultural College, Logan, Utah\n[Prepared by special request as an aid to poets who plan to enter the Eliza R. Snow Poem Contest—Ed.]\n\nWOMEN are born poets. They live close to elemental forces, rhythms, mysteries. But they differ prodigiously in their power to evoke in others the feelings that come to them. One reason they differ is that some of them \"play by ear,\" while others acquire the art of poetry and thus gain technical strength and richness. For anyone who fashions winged words is as far from thrush-like spontaneity of song as the radio is far from the wind in the wires. Because the gift for penning poetry is cultivable, one may make bold to offer a few suggestions to women poets.\nSince the goal is better poetry, the first problem is to decide what constitutes good poetry. A true poem may be said to be a contribution in rhythmic and melodious words to the world's beauty. It is raised above mere prose by greater intensity of emotion, deeper suggestiveness, and higher beauty.\nNow then, if a woman desires publication or a poetry prize, she should adopt an appropriate attitude. Previously, perhaps, she has written simply for the fun of it. But when she ventures before the figurative footlights—when she offers her lyric wares to the public—she leaves a snug little realm and enters another more exacting, more full of opportunity and responsibility. The atmosphere is that of competition. Once she had only herself to please; now she must please thousands. She has asserted superiority, and she must prove that she possesses it.\nThe obligation of the creative artist is, therefore, to contribute, to give something, or to do something better than it has been done before.\n\"Why do you write a poem?\" a reporter once asked Frost.\n\"To see if I can make it different from all other poems,\" the poet answered.\nThe reporter laughed, but Frost was not being merely flippant. He meant that each time he wrote he attempted to create some new bit of beauty.\nThis article is not, however, intended to help heighten the fever to be original at any cost. That frenzy has resulted in a miscellany of freakishness which has fully as much connection with our life as with the life on Mars, but not more. These efforts, impelled by a desire to end imitativeness and sometimes, apparently, to cut all links with the past, are hopeless. Shakespeare and Jonson, Wordsworth and Coleridge, Frost and Eliot could not have done it if they had wished; and neither can we.\n\nNor should we wish to cut our roots. The great poets have gained strength and stature by building upon the mountain of the past, and so can we.\n\"The old way to be new\" — the only sound way — is to let the great masters of poetry in all ages help you unfold your own capabilities.\n\nPage 371\nFOR MAKERS OF RHYTHMIC BEAUTY\n\nThen, as Emerson urged, \"Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string.\" You yourself are truly a creation in the sense of being a unique personality. Your task is to see and feel with the sensitivity of this peculiar individuality that is yours only, and to communicate with utter sincerity and fidelity.\n\nIF you have nourished your verbal conscientiousness, you will feel acute discomfort when you use a word that falls short of full and honest expression. You are flatting a note, spoiling a song, when you fail to match the word with the idea.\n\nBut beyond mere precision is a requirement more truly poetic: the need of suggestion. Bald facts cannot make a poem, and mere statements cannot either, no matter how tricked out with meter and ornaments. As Frost on another occasion said, \"Poetry is the only true thing that says one thing and means another.\" Yet poetry is not duplicity. It summons its powers to suggest the inexpressible. To come as close to the mysteries as reason and intuition can approach and to suggest these flashes of insight and faith through the most suitable symbols — that is the poet's hardest task.\n\nBut I hope no one will be misled by these allusions to misty and remote intangibles. The poet must be highly concrete and sensuous; and he must realize that bald and abstract statement is not poetry. Vivid appeals to the five senses are the raw materials from which the poet fashions word-paintings, word-sonatas which delight with their beauty and inspire with their hints of inexpressible meaning.\n\nBut there are other verse faults besides abstractions and prosy statements. To pass briefly to the negative, let me list typical faults observed in hundreds of poems:\n\n1. Threadbare idea.\n2. Threadbare words, figures of speech, and modes of expression. If you let a pine \"sigh,\" you will make your reader yawn. Calling a cloud \"fleecy\" turns it into a dust-mouse of triteness. And trite words are doubly obtrusive in rhyme, such as those which link \"strife\" with life\" and \"love\" with \"above.\" Likewise, such elisions as \"o'er,\" \"e'er\" and \"'twas\" are relics of an outworn fashion.\n3. Tacked-on moral. Bryant said it all before he came to the last stanza of \"To a Waterfowl.\" The modern poet may be as moral as he wishes, but he suggests rather than preaches.\n4. Padding; stuffing out a line or a stanza with words merely to get enough feet to satisfy the \"meter-reader.\"\n5. Weak ending; failure to sustain the original impetus.\n6. Prosiness, meaning lack of suggestion, lack of fresh, sensuous appeals and imagery, lack of sufficient intensity and elevation of style; in short, lack of poetry.\n\nAfter all, however, poems do not succeed because of the absence of minor faults, but because of the presence of strengths and virtues. Two criteria by which you may measure your latest poem are these:\n\n1. Suggestions. Does it suggest something too elusive or deep for mere prose to express?\n2. Contribution. Is it the finest contribution to beauty that you can create at this time?\n\nSuggested Readings\nHubbell and Beaty, An Introduction to Poetry (Macmillan).\nZillman, The Elements of English Verse (Macmillan) is also helpful.\nTwo Creative Traditions, edited by Pitcher, Baker, and Schramm (Farrar and Rinehart), provides examples of excellent writing which could serve as \"touchstones.\"\nR. K. Buell's Verse Writing Simplified (Stanford University Press) gives fundamentals of the art.\n\nPage 372"

    "content": "You Can Write a Prize Winner\nOlive W. Burt, Magazine Editor, The Deseret News\n[Prepared by special request as an aid to writers who plan to enter the Relief Society Short Story Contest — Ed.]\n\nIT isn't easy to write a prize-winning story in any contest — but it isn't too difficult, either. For every person who has lived with any degree of sympathy and understanding has locked within her experiences at least one excellent story.\n\nThe catch comes in recognizing that story and in putting it down on paper in such a way that others can recognize it.\n\nWhat is a good story?\nEvery writer's magazine or handbook carries a variety of definitions, so that the beginner may be confused and at a loss to decide just what constitutes a story.\nA simple and adequate definition seems to be that a story is a significant emotional experience sincerely and simply told. This definition covers even those highly plotted action stories, because there must be some sort of emotional experience by the characters if they \"come alive\" at all and are not mere wooden puppets acting without rhyme or reason.\n\nThe first task, then, is to recognize such an emotional experience. It may be in one's own life, or in that of a friend, or it may never really have happened at all, but be merely an emotional experience that could happen, given certain characters and certain events.\nSome writers have a store of such experiences just waiting to be put down on paper. Others can think up one, if they put forth a little effort. Others may find it difficult to decide just what material should be used.\n\nThere are a number of simple devices for sparking the thought processes along these lines. One might ask, \"What would happen if?\" and then make up a situation — an old mother was unhappy living with her married children and was determined to find a home for herself. Or — a middle-aged married woman suddenly found herself longing for the adventure and excitement she had never known while rearing her family. Or — anything at all!\n\nRight here might be the place to point out that stories for the Church magazines, and in particular for Thewhich is our present consideration, need not be moralistic. That is, the moral does not have to stick out like a sore thumb, to the detriment of the story and the annoyance of the reader. Every profound emotional experience has some moral implication. Let it stand — unemphasized and in its rightful place, hidden in the story — the more deeply hidden, the better.\n\nHAVING decided on the emotional experience that is to be the heart and core of the story, the next problem is to decide on the characters. Usually, the main characters\nPage 372\nPage 373\n\nNow how to put the problem down—how to reveal the emotional experience so vividly and poignantly that the reader will also \"live through\" the story?\nThere are two things to watch here: the writer must feel the story, herself. It is absolutely right that her tears should fall or her chuckles be heard as she writes. That is the most vital. And the second is like unto it—she must make her readers feel the story, too.\nThe simplest way to achieve this latter aim is by the use of simple, direct words and phrases—by the choice of specific rather than general terms.\nDescribe the characters by pointing out the special little things that make each one different from the others. The old mother may have faded, pale lips, as soft and dry as withered rose petals; the middle-aged wife may have her graying brown hair brushed back from her smooth, competent brow; one rebellious curl, only, escaping the rigor of the confining combs—or however she is seen by her creator—the author of the story.\nSpecial details should be carried over into each bit of action, a word or a phrase making that episode different from any other that ever took place.\nA device for gaining this definiteness is to write the story in the best possible manner, swiftly, and then go back over each character and each episode to check. If that particular necessary, specific term is not there—if the writer does not see this character, this episode, vividly and differently, then the particular words can be inserted.\nIT remains only to write the story. The author has her emotional experience selected; she has her characters and her initial situation. If she feels the story authentically and sincerely, the events will follow one another without too much trouble on the author's part. In the initial situation the characters, acting according to their personalities, will react in a certain way. This will give rise to the next situation, where the reaction is more or less inevitable.\nA couple of warnings here: it is dangerous and seldom satisfactory in a story to follow real-life episodes and situations. In real life there are so many intangible and extraneous forces working upon the character that the reaction can never be predicted with assurance. In a story, all such impalpable influences must be disregarded, and the character must act according to the definite traits that have been emphasized.\nAnd, as a general rule, the characters should act in accordance with generally accepted behavior patterns. That is, only experienced writers should attempt to show abnormal reactions: a mother should love her\n(Continued on page 430)\nPage 374"

    "content": "Relief Society Building News\nWITH the passing of June, there remains only the last quarter of the year which was set aside for the collection of the money for the erection of the Relief Society Building. In order for the books to be balanced in time for the general Relief Society conference, September 29 and 30, it is necessary for the final report accompanied by remittances to reach the general board by September 10. The year October 1947 to October 1948 will be marked as the time that the women of the Church, supported by the brethren, gathered the funds for an undertaking of which the sisters of the Church had dreamed since the days of Nauvoo.\nAs these last months pass, it is the earnest hope of the general board to find the name of every Relief Society member in the stakes and in as many of the missions as possible enrolled as a contributor. The names of many of the brethren will likewise be found as donors of Special and Memorial Gifts. The names of persons memorialized will also be entered upon the rolls to be placed in the cornerstone and preserved in the records of the general board. After the conclusion of the fund-raising period in October, special sheets will be sent to stakes and missions on which to list the names of contributors therefore no lists of names should be sent in before that time.\nSerious reflection on the work the women of the Church have accomplished and the greatness of this present undertaking, brings forth many expressions of gratitude for the opportunity given to donate to this cause.\nThe following letter from Juarez Stake on the completion of its quota is printed as a typical expression of such appreciation:\nRelief Society General Board Salt Lake City, Utah\nDear Sisters:\nEnclosed is a check which pays the Juarez Stake Building Fund quota in full. I am proud to submit this payment for it has proved to be an accurate proof of the devotion of the women of this stake to Relief Society work. It has been collected, not from projects nor sales of material on hand, but by individual solicitations. Not a member but has made an individual contribution as she was solicited by an authorized agent.\nThe grand total represents all types of sacrifices, ranging from careful saving of a\nPage 374\nPage 375\nRELIEF SOCIETY BUILDING NEWS\npeso at a time to the denying oneself of a personal need in order to have her donation ready. But in every case the sacrifice was willingly made. Not one sister, when the true facts were presented to her, but wanted to be counted among the contributors. And not one but proved she was equal to any demand made of her, just as are the women of the Church at all times. And not one but will be proud of her part in the erection of a Women's Building, though many there are who will never see it. Not one but feels she has helped the smallest stake in the Church to measure up and compare favorably with the larger and more affluent stakes. They have proved that strength comes from achievement and that confidence and power are obtained by overcoming seeming impossibilities.\nVery truly yours,\n(Signed) Nellie S. Hatch, President\nRita S. Johnson, Secretary\n\nIndividual receipt cards are being issued to the tens of thousands who have given donations. Many of these will be treasured in the years ahead by faithful Relief Society members who are today but girls whose mothers have encouraged their growing daughters to donate so they can be counted as contributors in the years to come. From such a free-will offering given by young girls may spring the roots of a devotion to Relief Society throughout their entire lives which will allow them opportunity to give their services to the Church.\nMISSIONS WHICH HAVE SENT IN 100% BUILDING QUOTAS\nNORTHERN CALIFORNIA MISSION\nEASTERN STATES MISSION\n\n[Photo of women with caption:] FIRST BRANCH IN CENTRAL STATES MISSION COMPLETES BUILDING QUOTA\nSeated left to right: Venna Witbeck, second counselor; Grace Cullimore, president; May Housley.\nStanding left to right: Dagmar Patterson; Alice Clauson; Elva Jacobson; Wilma Lindsey; Gertrude Russell; Wilhelmina Sellers; Margaret Anderson; Virginia Austin.\nOther members who participated but who are not in picture: Ruby Stallings, first counselor; Freedonia Glaze; Corrine Booth; Merle Fillian; Ann Artman.\n\nPage \nSTAKES WHICH HAVE SENT IN 100% BUILDING QUOTAS\nSOUTH IDAHO FALLS (IDAHO) IDAHO FALLS STAKE (IDAHO) SAN DIEGO STAKE (CALIFORNIA) WELLS STAKE (UTAH) TETON STAKE (IDAHO AND WYOMING) GRANITE STAKE (UTAH) NORTH IDAHO FALLS STAKE (IDAHO) EMIGRATION STAKE (UTAH) MESA STAKE (ARIZONA)\nREXBURG STAKE (IDAHO) UVADA STAKE (NEVADA AND UTAH) UTAH STAKE (UTAH) SEATTLE STAKE (WASHINGTON) SOUTH LOS ANGELES STAKE (CALIF.)

    "content": "A House By Friday\nFay Tarlock\n\"IT will be up to you to find a house,\" my husband called to me from the bathroom of the Hotel Geneve where he was shaving, our first morning in Mexico. \"I won't be back from the stadium before dark any day. And I'm late now.\"\nThis seemed an exaggeration; the sun was not yet up. I yawned and stretched my travel-weary limbs. \"I don't see how I can possibly find a house,\" I protested, thumping my pillow and preparing to sink into it, ready for a sleep as soon as he left the room. \"The only Spanish words I know are buenos dias, cuanto and es mucho.\"\n\"As long as you keep saying the last, we'll get along.\" He grinned down at me. \"Get a newspaper, The Excelsior is as good as any, and you'll find a list of places for rent on the English page.\" He was at the door now.\n\n\"Call up the housing agencies; they all speak English, and they might send someone to show you around. And don't forget the Diplomatic Proviso.\" He shut the door carefully so as not to awaken our small son, and was gone.\nI went back to sleep. The high altitude was wonderful those first few weeks; it helped us to sleep through all the worries and noises of Mexico. When Danny awakened at nine I got him into his last clean clothes and we went down to the dining room. It was very pleasant there with the brilliant murals and the sunlight streaming on white table linen and dark-eyed waitresses.\nAs I ate my first slice of papaya and munched a second pan dulce (sweet roll), the problem of finding a house seemed simple.\n\"Everything is so cheap in Mexico,\" many people back home had told me. \"Houses and apartments are plentiful there and so reasonable. You can pick one in any neighborhood you want.\"\nWasn't the American Embassy just around the corner? The obvious thing to do was to go there and get a list of houses. And do it before twelve o'clock because today was Saturday.\nIt was exhilarating walking along Calle Londres, breathing the thin air, sweetened by last night's rain. Dense white clouds were floating across the deep blue sky, and it was warm enough to throw back my coat. I looked up at the gray houses, reminiscent of the reign of Maximilian and Carlotta, and at the tree-lined avenue. Just as I had read, it was like Paris, only the air was better.\nAt the Embassy there was a charming young woman rushing through her work for a weekend in Cuernavaca. Between answering the telephone in two languages and giving out information, she found me a list of apartments for rent.\nNot one to hesitate, I chose the address nearest the Embassy. First we had to cross Avenida Insurgentes, the busiest thoroughfare in Mexico. Three times we started across and three times we came scurrying back to the sidewalk. The cars and buses went by in a never-ending stream, each one driven by a madman, I was certain. The din of the honking made my head whirl. This will never do, I thought. I told myself that for years I had strolled across Market Street in San Francisco every evening at five o'clock. Grabbing my son in my arms, I ran. Taxis swerved by me, a red bus seemed to touch my dress, and a car came to a screeching halt. But we were across. The apartment house was ultra modern. The list said furnished, and my hopes rose. These new apartment houses were furnished with charm and comfort, surpassing those of the States, I had heard. The foyer door was open; I rang every bell in the place, but no one answered. Across the avenue I could see a little soft drink place with a familiar sign. The proprietor was a sandy-haired man who looked like an American. When a lull in the traffic came, I made a second dash across Insurgentes. The proprietor had once been an American, but the patina of Mexico lay upon him now. The apartments, he assured me, were lovely. They had everything that Madam could wish for, and if I cared to sit in his shop he would go across to ask the manager, a dear friend of his, if there was a vacancy. I sat down and ordered lemonades for us, which we slowly sipped until the man returned. He came straight to our table, spreading his hands in a purely Latin gesture.\nSo sorry he was, but the apartments were unfurnished. If I cared to furnish one, I would be charmed with the results. I thanked him and started for the next address, thankful it was on the same side of the street. A servant girl with strong white teeth and long black braids answered my ring. I said buenos dias and was stopped. The girl stood there, smiling and patient. I got out my list, mumbling something about apartment. Instantly her smile flashed in understanding. \"Un momentito,\" she said, carefully closing the door.\nBut Danny had other ideas. \"I'm tired; I want to sit down,\" said he, squatting squarely in the doorway. The maid was distressed. Doors are not left open in Mexico. I removed my son and waited. \"Un momentita,\" I repeated, savoring the word. I had another one to add to my vocabulary.\nThe door opened cautiously and a vivacious little Mexican woman smiled up at me. \"The apartment was what you say for rent. Now eet ees no more.\" The door shut carefully again.\n\"I don't want apartments; I want a house,\" my son said.\nBEFORE lunch I inspected two other apartments. One was so big that it was a day's journey from the front door to the kitchen. The price I did not inquire. And the next, in contrast to the shining cleanliness of the others, looked as if it had not been cleaned since the days of Porfirio Diaz.\nAfter luncheon I called an agency. A man with an American voice answered. Yes, he had houses if Madam could afford them. People in the States, he said, had the erroneous idea that living was cheap in Mexico. Instead of a house, I should have an apartment, no? I thanked him and hung up the receiver.\nI took a little nap and started out again with the Embassy list. A HOUSE BY FRIDAY \"Take a libre when you go any place,\" my husband had told me, \"and you must bargain with the driver.\" Try to get him for a peso. Don't offer more than one fifty.\"\nI was refreshed, but not enough to give my Spanish vocabulary another try. From the address the apartment was only a few blocks away. But after I had walked an hour, I realized that the Mexican numbering system was not the same as that at home. We made frequent stops to sit on the grass. Still my legs were trembling.\nMy number was on the third and top floor of the building. Only a maid was in the apartment; she made no attempt to speak as she led me through the rooms. The furniture was charming, the beds sagging and hard, and the kitchen was not pleasing. Mexican kitchens, I was learning, were not built for the lady of the house.\nOut on the street I saw a cruising libre. In a moment of inspiration, helped by my tired legs and my protesting son, I said, \"Hotel Geneva, un peso cincuenta centavos.\" The driver opened the door and we got in.\nSunday we would have all day to look for houses. On Sunday my husband bought a paper, pointing out that he had already suggested this procedure. I said nothing. It seemed rather silly to confess that on my first day I hesitated even to buy a paper.\n\"There's no use looking for anything in the Lomas,\" he said, running down the list, \"only rich Americans and politicos can afford to live there.\"\n\nAnd San Angel is too far out for my work.\" He read further. \"Here's one on Aguas Calientes, modern with two bedrooms.\" The price he read was high, but not entirely beyond our means, provided we economized on other things. \"That's the same street as the stadium,\" he went on. \"Can't be much of a place.\" We drove near the vicinity of the stadium and I agreed with him. There was no use going to any house, he said, because Sunday in Mexico was no day for it. I objected, reminding him that in San Francisco it was the big house-hunting day. Well, it was different here. We drove towards Chapultepec Castle to watch the Sunday parade.\n\nMONDAY morning I called up two agencies, getting almost identical lists from each. Neither offered to show me the places. I delayed going because at noon Mr. Tarlock was coming to take me to one place. We decided nothing must be overlooked and started for Aguas Calientes. In the park around the National Stadium the country men were standing in patient lines, waiting to get inside on their first lap of the journey to the States. Past the stadium the buildings become larger and more ornate. Across Insurgentes was an entirely different section, one with beautiful homes, well-tended sidewalk lawns and gardens. Willow trees lined the street. The number was set above a high glass gate, protected by an iron grill. A white wall, topped with barbed wire, obscured the view of the house. We found the bell, imbedded in the concrete of the wall. After a long wait a neat young servant girl with low coifed hair admitted us. She bowed and with lowered eyes asked us to be seated in the garden. I was delighted. The house was a white stucco with a red-tiled roof and had beautifully leaded windows, shaped in Gothic arches. The garden was lovely with its tiled walks, neat lawns, and roses and carnations, arranged in geometric design. Close to the house were two pomegranate trees in full bloom. On either side of the garden were two tiled seats, above each seat a lovely plaque. There was also a tiled fountain, spouting a tiny spray of water into the brilliant sunshine. I sat down on the bench, my eyes bright. This was my house!\n\nThe great glass door opened and a young man came out, a University student, I was sure. He had light-brown hair and blue eyes and no Castilian Don could have been more proud. Although he bowed and said, \"Buenos tardes,\" I felt myself to be an undesirable turista who should never have crossed the Rio Grande. The youth permitted us to enter the house. Once inside, my spirits soared even higher. There were long tiled corridors with high ceilings, bathed in sunlight from the arched windows. In the living room or sala was the largest fireplace I had ever seen. Indeed la sala was as large as the average American home. Above the fireplace hung a magnificent tapestry woven with golden threads. The walls were a Spanish brown; the high-beamed ceiling was white. Across one end of the room was a Chinese tapestry with white dragons, turquoise trees, and floating blossoms, all against a red background. The furniture was hand-carved mahogany, some of it Spanish and some of it French, and like nothing I had ever seen outside a museum. There were high-backed chairs with red leather seats, each with a different coat of arms, and a massive desk. About the room was a profusion of carved tables and oriental vases. A glass door, high as the ceiling, led to the dining room. This had a red-tiled floor and one side was all windows and glass doors, leading into a charming back garden, where stood a single tree, not yet in bloom. The kitchen was newly whitewashed. It boasted a steel sink and cabinet, an electric refrigerator, and a new gas stove.\n\nWe went back to the living room, my feet light on the polished oak boards. Halfway up the long, tile-decorated stairway was a window portraying a mountain village, green in the subdued light. One of the two bedrooms was Madonna blue and rose, with elegant mahogany furnishings. The other bedroom was simpler, in cream and brown coloring. And the bath! Blue tile almost to the ceiling and another leaded window with a design of a blue mermaid with long golden hair, sitting on golden rocks above the splashing sea. There was a closet bigger than a dream, and a clothespress in the smaller room. The windows overlooked an old colonial estate across the street.\n\nI was beside myself to know if the price mentioned in the paper was right and if we could rent the house. The youth refused any answer. We had permission to telephone his mother, who would be home at two o'clock. At precisely two o'clock I was dialing the Frickson telefono. A pleasant voice answered, \"Yes, yes, I can tell you the price, but will you not call at seven this evening that I may talk to you personally.\" Just at seven o'clock we again rang the bell in the white wall. The same demure maid admitted us. We lingered for a moment in the serenity of the garden. It was almost dark, for there is little twilight on the plateau. The house already seemed our own.\n\nA young girl, evidently the youth's sister, appeared in the doorway. She stood there for a moment, after the lights flashed on. She was no more than five feet tall, as delicately made as a China figurine and graceful as a flower. When she introduced herself, she was as gracious and warm as the boy had been remote. Her English? She had learned it in the States, where she was born. \"Now,\" she said, \"I do not often get a chance to speak it, but I read much in English.\"\n\nAs she spoke, a slender woman, dressed in black, with a lace mantilla over her head, came into the room. She was a beautiful woman, white-haired, with bright, flashing eyes. She and the room combined all the stories and enchantment of Old Mexico. Instinctively we rose to greet her.\n\nThe house, she explained in her charming voice, had been the special quarters of her husband, built to house his tapestries. This room had been his office. Now she was a widow, with no use for so many rooms. Would we like to see the house again? In the evening light the house seemed even more captivating. I had to pull myself from the spell and be practical. Seated again, we talked of many things: the rising prices, the war, Mexico in the spring. Everything except renting the house. Each time we neared the subject, the Senora expertly steered us to other topics.\n\nMy husband gave me no help in bringing the conversation around to renting the place. I knew that in a moment we must go, and nothing was settled.\n\nGripping the arms of the leather rocker, I asked in forthright western style if we could rent the house. The Senora looked pained. \"That I do not know, just now,\" she gently chided me. You perhaps have not seen many houses yet.\" Then she smiled. ''I must have time to think. Your boy here\" — she reached out to save him from spilling backwards from a carved chair . . . ''there is much glass . . . there are my gardens ... I do not know. In a day or two you may call me again.\" With exquisite courtesy she bade us good night. \"We can scratch that number off,\" the head of the house said as we drove back to the hotel. \"She doesn't want a child there.\" I felt badly. I had heard so much of the great love Mexicans had for children. I had not expected Danny to be an obstacle. \"There's nothing he could hurt really,\" I protested. \"He doesn't harm things and I'd be so careful.\" Tomorrow get busy and call agencies. Get all their places . . . was But Tuesday morning I called an agency. After checking the cheapest places, I asked that appointments be made for me to see them. That afternoon, with the aid of the pocket dictionary, I bargained with a driver to take me to the addresses, wait, and return me to the hotel.\n\nThe first house was on the edge of the Lomas. It had so many unnecessary rooms that my head ached with even the thought of keeping them clean. The furniture was brilliant and elaborate, but none of it comfortable. The beds were hard and the kitchen would require two assistants to the cook. Outside was a long-neglected garden and a dead lawn.\n\nThe second place was in the Lomas itself. A high hedge surrounded it, a hedge shot through with iron bars and with an iron gate that seemed to touch the sky. After a long wait a man servant admitted me. I followed him up a winding path to the house. There was no entrance at all. The servant pressed a button. Miraculously the front parted, revealing stairs and a door. Again the door was heavily barred. We waited for it to be opened from the inside. Once inside I tripped and almost fell over a stout iron pipe, a thief trap I was to learn later.\n\nThe house was empty at nights except for a watchman. The owner, a smartly dressed woman, and the interpreter, her friend, waited beyond the iron bar. The place was quite new, the rooms large and sunny. There were two bedrooms and a study that could be made into a child's room. The house was amply furnished, but not elegantly, except for the satin wallpaper, an import from France. Instead of a single kitchen, there were two, each with a table in the center, piled high with cooking utensils.\n\nBecause the owner was leaving for, South America, the house could be rented immediately if I signed a three-year lease and deposited seven hundred pesos to insure that the wallpaper would not be injured. I swallowed and said that tonight I would bring my husband to sign the lease, provided the Diplomatic Proviso was inserted.\n\nThere was much excited chattering and I caught the words \"Tio Sam.\" I felt certain from their faces that I would not sign the lease. I was relieved also; the markets were a long way off, which meant my stay in Mexico would be spent riding back and forth on buses.\n\nThe ladies announced their decision. If Madam could not find a house within a week and this house was still unrented, she could return. In the meantime the Senora's attorney would investigate the Proviso.\n\nThe next day, Wednesday, I went out to Colonia del Valle, where rents were more suited to government employees. One house was cheap enough, but it was so dark, here in the land of vivid sunshine, that electricity must be burned all day. Another house almost met my desire for a place small enough to be manageable. It was set in a pleasant little garden, protected by a hedge.\n\nThe owner was a sweet little gray-haired lady who wanted to go to another state to live with her son. Just how I learned this, I could not rightly say, for she spoke no English, but we soon had each other's life history. She was an artist. At least she did her own art work.

    "content": "The Latter-day Saints in San Bernardino\nEvelyn Wilde Heath\nFormer President, San Bernardino Stake Relief Society\n\nTo San Bernardino, be sure to stop for awhile. It is called \"The Friendly City,\" and well merits the name. It is cosmopolitan in its activities; its buildings are fine and modern; its streets are wide and straight. It is a beautiful city of about 57,000 population, the county seat of San Bernardino County, which holds the distinction of being the largest county in the world.\n\nThis city of beauty and unlimited advantages stands as a monument to the ingenuity of those farseeing men who engineered and planned it; a monument to the stout hearts of that fine group of Latter-day Saints who first settled in its valley. Perhaps San Bernardino, as a city, would never have been a reality had not ex-soldiers of the Mormon Battalion in California carried back tales of the country they had left, and of its superior advantages. These tales stimulated the desire of the saints in Salt Lake City to go there, and by 1850, many were anxious to move toward the Pacific.\n\nBecause of this, and a need to establish a wagon road to California, and also a place where converts, arriving from various points, might rest and equip themselves for the journey to Utah, consent was given for the move. The \"Manuscript History\" of President Brigham Young states that the original plan for this settlement called for about twenty persons, is or fortune ever leads you whereas, when they were assembled, the number approached five hundred.\n\nElders Amasa M. Lyman and Charles C. Rich were appointed as leaders. Elder Parley P. Pratt, who was heading a group of missionaries en route to the South Sea Islands, also accompanied the party. From his diary, and the diary of Elder Rich, comes much valuable information regarding the trip.\n\nBrother Rich mentions Andrew Lytle as \"Captain of hundreds,\" and David Seely and Joseph Mathews as \"Captains of fifties.\" He refers, also, to Parley Pratt, Captain Jefferson Hunt, Samuel Rolph, and Wellington Seely as \"Captains of tens,\" and to Elder Amasa Lyman as \"Captain of two tens.\" We know, from this, that the movement was well organized.\n\nDuring the early part of the journey the company traveled in two sections. In all, there were 150 wagons, 588 oxen, 336 cows, 21 young stock, 107 horses, 52 mules, and about 437 men, women, and children.\n\nNeedless to say, formidable difficulties faced them and, while their approximate route was the old Spanish trail of the thirties and forties, many were the trials encountered from the heavy desert sands, rocky country, steep mountain grades, and attacks by Indians. Stretches of dry desert wastes, with little water or food for the animals, were a constant hazard.\n\nPage 385-386\n\nMORMON GRISTMILL\nThe photograph shows the gristmill as it was remodeled by William A. Conn after the departure of the Latter-day Saint colonists. Many accounts are told of the treacherous journey of this company, of their faith and their constant appeals to God to strengthen them and their teams, and of their miraculous deliverance from the horrors of the desert. One can, therefore, imagine their great joy that this trip was made with so little loss and misfortune.\n\nAt the latter end of the journey, Amasa M. Lyman, Captain Jefferson Hunt, Joseph Mathews, and Charles C. Rich preceded the wagon trains, and on June 9, 1851, reached the sycamore grove near the southern end of Cajos Pass. Captain Seely's fifties reached this point two days later, June 41, 1851.\n\nThe date on which these weary and footsore Mormon pioneers paused on the edge of the San Bernardino Valley is, indeed, a memorable one in valley history.\n\nWITHIN A MONTH OF THEIR ARRIVAL AT THE SYCAMORE GROVE, this colony of saints held their first conference. David Seely was elected President of the mission, with Samuel Rolfe and Simeon Andrews as counselors, and Richard R. Hopkins as secretary. From the intimate views of life in San Bernardino as recorded in the minutes of Brother Hopkins, much rich material has been gathered.\n\nThat the pioneers were welcomed into the valley, first reservedly, then with greater confidence because of their apparent fine qualities, is certain from an account taken from The Los Angeles Star early in July 1851, which reads: We learn that they (the Mormons) are negotiating for the purchase of the Rancho of San Bernardino from the family of Don Antonio Maria Lugo, by whom it is held. This is the site of the old Mission of San Bernardino. Here probably this interesting people will make their first establishment on the shores of the Pacific.\n\nA later and less reserved mention is quoted from the same source: The Mormons are an industrious community, and will develop the resources of this county to an extent that will give it an importance second to no county in the state.\n\nAfter careful consideration, negotiations were concluded for the purchase of the San Bernardino Rancho for the sum of $77,500. One realizes from this the vast undertaking and obligation that lay ahead of these settlers. In those days, the settlers were vulnerable to vicious attacks by the Indians regardless of the friendly attitude the saints held for them, and it was necessary to build a strong stockade, which was accomplished by the donated work of all the men of the settlement.\n\nThe stockade occupied approximately 700 x 300 feet of space. The walls were of fifteen-foot cottonwood and willow logs, split in half, and set three feet in the ground side by side. Upon this spot, where once stood the stockade, the fine building of the San Bernardino County Court House now stands, while a marker designates the place as \"The Mormon Stockade.\"\n\nCrowded into this small space, housewives must have had many nerve-wracking experiences for the men were away the greater part of the time. They were heroines indeed.\n\nHere they remained, waiting for the surveying and laying out of the city. As with all Latter-day Saint settlements, the planting of crops was paramount. It is recorded that by December 1851, a field of 1300 acres was selected as a grain field, and a 300-acre field for summer crops. Also, a tract for a vineyard was laid out.\n\nEarly in April, Elders Lyman and Rich planted the center stake for the City of San Bernardino on Temple Block (now Pioneer Park). This was located on E Street, between Fifth and Sixth Streets. Mr. Hess, a surveyor, assisted them. When the streets were laid out, the ones running east and west were numbered as at present, but those running north and south were given names. The present E Street was Salt Lake Street, and D Street was Utah Street.\n\nA canvas pavilion had served as an assembly hall, but in April, a \"bowery\" was erected. It was an adobe building sixty by thirty feet. Here the conference was held on April 6, 1852. This building served for day school for 125 scholars under the direction of two well-qualified teachers and was also used for Sunday services.\n\nMuch mention is made of the importance of schooling for the children of the settlement. The first gristmill for the production of flour was located near the intersection of the present Mill and Allen Streets. The mill wheel was to be turned by water diverted from Warm Creek. This work was begun in May 1852.\n\nA note dated June 26, 1852, written by Brother Hopkins is of special interest: Today we have the pleasure of receiving news from our friends in the Valley (Salt Lake).... Near nine months has elapsed without our hearing a word from them. All hands turned out and gave hearty welcome to eight numbers of the Deseret News.\n\nThat the spirit of love and charity existed in this early settlement is very evident by the fact that the first Fourth of July was celebrated, on July 5 (the Fourth being Sunday), by harvesting the grain of Elder Rich during his absence on a trip to Salt Lake City. Every July Fourth, thereafter, was celebrated in patriotic fashion.\n\nThat the valley was fertile and crops successful is certain for it is recorded at a \"Harvest Feast\" held September 4, 1852, such specimens were displayed as a stalk of Indian corn sixteen feet high; four onions weighing nine and one-half pounds; a cabbage weighing twenty-four and one-half pounds; with melons, squashes, and other vegetables in proportion.\n\nOn November 7, 1852, Colonel Henry Washington, a United States Deputy surveyor, completed erection of a monument on the top of Mt. San Bernardino. Through it ran the base line from which surveys in the southern part of California were, and still are made. This street is called Base Line today.\n\nIn the Fall of 1852, Captain Jefferson Hunt was elected to the Legislature of California and in April 1853, he introduced a bill to form San Bernardino County from the eastern portion of Los Angeles County. This bill was passed. The following month, Elders Lyman and Rich and Brother Thorpe began work upon their sawmill on Mill Creek.\n\nThis met the settlers' needs for several months; then, in order to reach the top of the San Bernardino mountains, where a greater amount of timber could be obtained and where another mill would furnish further lumber, it was necessary to build a road. This enormous task was accomplished by the men of the Latter-day Saints' settlement alone. It is estimated that the project cost about 1000 days of labor. A monument, in honor of the men who built the road, was erected in 1932, at a point where the old road, made by them, crosses the present highway.\n\nOne wonders at the great FIRST STEAM MILL IN THE SAN BERNARDINO MOUNTAINS 389 accomplishments of these early-day settlers, and especially at the building of so many sawmills, which space will not permit to be enumerated, nor credit given to their builders, but for which an engine and boiler were even dismantled from a British vessel, and hauled into San Bernardino. 'This was done by Charles Crismon who is credited with having the first steam sawmill on the mountain top. Brother Crismon was active in many sawmill operations.\n\nEquipment for another mill was shipped around the Horn to Wilmington. The equipment for the various mills was evidently freighted to the mountain tops by the use of block and tackle or the snubbing post, and the united strength of many oxen. The Latter-day Saint settlers furnished, not only their own people, but Southern California, as well, with flour and lumber from their mills.\n\nThis mill was built in Huston Flat, about 1853, by Charles Crismon. In 1865, it was moved to Blue Jay camp in Little Bear Valley, then to Pacific Electric camp, and finally to Lake Arrowhead.\n\nDEDICATION OF PIONEER MONUMENT ON HIGH-GEAR ROAD, \n\nThis monument, in the San Bernardino Mountains, marks the point where the present highway crosses the old Mormon road, which was built for hauling lumber down from the mountains.\n\nANY new settlers were now arriving in San Bernardino valley from various points and news was becoming more plentiful with their arrival. At about this time, Elder Lyman, Elder Rich, and their company began the erection of a store building. Goods for the store were bought in San Francisco, and shipped by steamer to San Pedro. Ten teams hauled these goods from the steamer to San Bernardino.\n\nIn September 1853, the survey of the City of San Bernardino and the laying off of the streets was begun. The city was divided into blocks with one-acre lots, and it now became possible for families to leave the stockade, and begin to build homes. This was followed by an era of building business blocks and various community structures, as well.\n\nIn 1853, the saints in the valley also came into personal contact with a national undertaking. This was of great importance, for, under the direction of Jefferson Davis, then Secretary of War, the Federal Government surveyed Cajon Pass with reference to its suitability as a railroad pass.\n\nThe next year, the City of San Bernardino was incorporated, and on June 5th was held the election for the first city officers, as follows: Mayor, Amasa Lyman; the council, C. C. Rich, G. W. Sirrine, Daniel Starks, William J. Cox, and Q. S. Sparks; Marshall, J. D. Holliday; assessor, Theodore Turley; treasurer, J. H. Rollins; attorney, A. A. M. Jackson. Ordinances were adopted to restrict drinking and gambling.\n\nIn the spring of 1855, freighting to Salt Lake began on a commercial scale. The United States Government had expended $25,000 of the amount needed for improvement of a road between Utah and California.\n\nSAN BERNARDINO COUNTY HOUSE\n\nThis building is on the site of the old Stockade. Note the street marker, with the Court house, and designating it as the \"Mormon Stockade.\"\n\nElder Lyman and Elder Rich were called in 1857 by the Church authorities to return to Utah, and on about April 16, they, with others, making quite a train, left San Bernardino for Salt Lake City. In this train was Joseph H. Ridges, a convert from Australia, who later built the great organ in the Salt Lake Tabernacle.\n\nThe responsibility of the property, and its remaining indebtedness, now rested on Ebenezer Hanks. In the records of Brother Hopkins appears the following: October 30. The mail from Great Salt Lake City arrived at San Bernardino with lots of news. President Brigham Young thinks the valleys of the mountains (in Utah) is the place for the saints.\n\nTHIS was about the time when the coming of Johnston's Army threatened the security of the people in Utah, and was, no doubt, one factor which influenced President Brigham Young to recall the San Bernardino settlers.\n\nOn November 2, President Cox received counsel from President Young to forward the saints to the valleys of Utah as soon as possible, in wisdom, and November 3d found quite a number of the saints leaving San Bernardino for Utah. It is easy to imagine the heartache and disappointment felt by those saints who had struggled so unceasingly to make a settlement.\n\nOn February 15, 1858, Brother Ebenezer Hanks formally deeded to William A. Conn, George L. Tucker, and Richard G. Allen, the last of the San Bernardino Rancho—about 25,000 acres—for the sum of $18,000. This cleared up the indebtedness and left a little balance.\n\nCaptain Jefferson Hunt was, perhaps, one of the last to leave the valley.\n\nSo ended one of the most touching chapters in the history of Latter-day Saint pioneering.\n\nNote: The author used \"Heritage of the Valley\" by George W. and Helen P. Beattie as a basis for much of the information found in the article.\n\nSixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, June 1, and June 15, 1888\n\n\"For THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ZION AND THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ALL NATIONS\"\n\nBRIGHAM YOUNG We do not call thee Chieftain, Thy cheek would flush to hear Earth's titles woven with thy name, And whispered in thine ear, As well presume to gild the sun, Or paint earth's brightest flowers; We only call thee Brigham Young, We only call thee ours.\n\nSARAH E. CARMICHAEL\n\nEDUCATION IN UTAH: Simultaneously with the constructing of homes, the subduing of lands, began educational work in Utah. It was like all things else a difficult and rather unpleasant undertaking, as there were so few conveniences; but it became the task of a noble and bright young woman—Mary Jane Dilworth, afterward wife of Bishop F. A. Hammond—to collect in her brother-in-law's tent, even before the houses were built, and instruct the children who were playing away the sunny hours in the courtyard of the old fort.\n\nThis was the first school in Utah, and the first school teacher was a woman. As other companies of children arrived in the valleys and the people spread out in other directions, other schools were started and the demand for teachers became greater.\n\nMRS. EMMELINE B.\n\nWells, our editor, pleasingly tells of a little school of 65 kept by herself in 1851-52 in a log building in the upper part of the city; how, without desks, charts, blackboards, or scarcely two books of the same kind, she toiled as an instructress—A. W. C.\n\nNOTE: The Queen of Sweden has been ordered by her doctors to get up early, make her own bed, take care of her own room, work in the garden, and take long walks. Under this regimen, her health is visibly improving.\n\nSELECTED.\n\nTHE ALLOWANCE: We think that husband who has any certainty of income would do well to take into consideration the subject of his wife's wages, and see if he cannot accord to her the spending of one unquestioned dollar, and then make, according to his ability, some fixed allowance of money, be it ever so small, on which the wife can rely, and over which she can be absolute mistress. We can hardly think of a case where it would not work well. Without doubt, any head of a house would find his advantage in this course, in the character it would give his household, in the happy sense of responsibility it would give his wife, and in relief from requests and advice in small things which it would give himself.\n\nSELECTED.\n\nFROM RAMAH, NEW MEXICO: We are having a most lovely spring, after the severest winter ever known in this place since the Saints settled here. Our prospects are bright and everything is promising—Phebe A. McNeil.\n\nAN INVENTION: The Empress Victoria of Germany has turned inventor. From plans drawn by her, a writing desk has been manufactured which enables the Emperor to write whether lying in bed or standing up. It is available in any position, and the mechanism is said to be intricate and remarkably effective.\n\nSELECTED.\n\nPAGE 392 WOMAN'S SPHERE Ramona W. Cannon\n\nN March, Utah music lovers listened to Dorothy Eustis, playing as concert pianist with the Utah State symphony orchestra, a brilliant and sympathetic rendition of the Grieg concerto. Across America, from Town Hall and Syracuse, New York, to Seattle and California, she has given concerts, playing with Beecham, Iturbi, Kruger, Stokowski, Sevitzky. She is regarded as one of the foremost young pianists in America. She made piano recordings for the moving picture Carnegie Hall.\n\nThe great-grandparents of Miss Eustis lived in Utah, and Dorothy is married to Phillip Farnsworth Cannon, son of Mr. And Mrs. Espey T. Cannon of Salt Lake City.\n\nLYDIA HAMP BAKER (Mrs. Charles Baker), believed to be Utah's second oldest woman, celebrated her 100th birthday in February. She is a convert to the Church from Northamptonshire, England.\n\nMRS. GERHARDENA ALBRIGTSEN TAYLOR, 80, died March 21. A convert to the Church from Norway, she married John Wade Taylor in 1885 and has since lived in Ogden. She was both teacher and treasurer in the Third Ward Relief Society there.\n\nORA PATE STEWART'S book, God Planted a Tree, is a genealogical picture of the generations of God's covenant children from Adam through the various dispensations. By graphs, intelligent condensation, and piquant comment, the material is made vital, clear, and interesting.\n\nHE nationally-known Ziff-Davis Company has announced that any woman in its organization who gives birth to a baby will receive three months' leave of absence with full pay.\n\nMRS. M. BROADBENT, wife of David A. Broadbent, daughter of Joseph R. Murdock, and mother of fourteen children and grandmother of twenty-six grandchildren, has recently been honored as \"Utah State Mother\" for 1948. Mrs. Broadbent's Church and civic service has been outstanding and she is known as a charming and gracious homemaker, a devoted friend, and a good Samaritan among her neighbors.\n\nThe Girl Scout Convention in Long Beach, California, a Utah woman, Mrs. Alan H. Means, was presented an award of appreciation for services rendered. Now honorary vice-president of the organization, Mrs. Means was national president from 1941 to 1946.\n\nN June 18, 1873, Susan B. Anthony was fined because she insisted on voting at an election in Rochester, New York.\n\nPAGE 393\n\nTHE relationship between a father and a daughter is particularly precious. The father gives protection, provides the necessities of life, and above all bestows his priceless companionship. The daughter, as she grows and develops in discernment and appreciation, gives love, admiration, respect, and obedience. These emotions and loyalties are bright strands that hold the family close together.\n\nMost important in the life of the daughter are the early, vulnerable years, which may not be remembered, but which, nevertheless, shape the pliable contour of all the years to come. The father and daughter began to get acquainted when the father took his baby in his arms and cradled her with tenderness. The attachment grew as they went walking together. She was only as tall as his knees and there was a great distance from there up to the top of the father's head, but his face was kind and she could look up and see how the wind ruffled his hair and she could look down and see the great strides his feet made, and she had to skip fast to keep up with him.\n\nHow tenderly a father watches and protects his daughter through the years of young womanhood, knowing that in her choice of friends and in her developing attitudes, lie the great determiners of all her future life. Few fathers would ever say, \"See that you get a husband as good as your old father once established for her.\" Overlooking faults, always strengthening virtues, the true father stands back of his children in strength and tenderness.\n\nHe is old and becomes gradually less able to take an active part in life, more and more he appreciates the frequent letter, the cheerful visits, the little remembrances and words of appreciation. Every unselfish, hard-working father is a great man—and he should be made to feel that his accomplishments have been far above the power of his children to measure.\n\nI would keep forever in my heart the picture of my father standing in the doorway of our adobe ranch house, which he had built with his own hands, looking out over the golden acres of wheat that rippled up to the cedared hills. I would remember his words, as he pointed to the harvest, \"There is your college education.\" And then the grip of his hand as he said, \"It will be lonely without you.\"\n\nBut the love of a father endures forever—a treasure never dulled by time or distance.\n\nV.

    "content": "Far Country\nGladys I. Hamilton\nThe conductor touched Ann T Medford's trim-suited shoulder and murmured, \"We're coming into Rockwood how, Miss, Our station,\" \"Thank you,\" Ann said pleasantly, but her hands were so clammy cold with nervousness that her new gloves were wet.\nFor the hundredth time since leaving Ohio, and her home, Ann wondered if Jim would like her. And, would she like him? Would he still be, man-like, expecting to see her as the eighteen-year-old girl he had been engaged to twenty years ago? Would he be shocked at what those years had done to her pink and white complexion, her soft, brown hair and trim ankles?\nShe hoped that life had probably changed him more than it had her. Ann was still slim, and her skin quite good. A few silver strands threaded her hair, for there was no denying that the years had left some trace of their passing.\nShe gathered her things from the hat rack, put her gloves in her purse, then took them out again. She stood up, but the train was still in motion, so she sat down again. She felt as fluttery and unpoised as a school girl, more so, for she hadn't the least idea what she should do or say when she saw him!\nJim would be waiting on the platform, naturally, in plain sight, since Rockwood was such a small prairie town. She needn't get off the minute the train stopped. She could peek out the window and if Jim didn't look . . . well . . . \"right,\" she would just remain on the train and go on to California. Her ticket read straight through, anyway.\nAnn and Jim had re-discovered each other only a few weeks ago through a mutual friend who had met Jim in Pendleton at the rodeo. Jim had written first from his ranch in Nevada, and Ann had answered. In the course of correspondence they both marveled that neither had married in all the intervening years. Timidly, they mentioned their old love, and the lover's quarrel in which Ann's mother had taken sides against Jim, which had resulted in Ann's yielding to her mother's wishes and breaking off the engagement.\nJim, his young pride crushed, had gone away shortly afterward. So the immediate question of their letters was, could they still fan the flame of that old love into the joyous wonder that it had been at eighteen and twenty-two?\nThey both fervently admitted that the fire had never really died, that no other person had interested either one of them, even mildly. Of course they wanted marriage and a home! The joy of marriage and children had been denied them in their youth, but there was still time to make a good life together. It was worth trying, they had concluded.\n\"I know my mind,\" Jim had written, \"but you must decide, little Ann, for if you follow your heart you will be coming to a far country.\"\n398\n\nThe train screeched to a stop and the ding-dong of the engine's bell sent shivery reverberations through Ann's breast. The porter, with her suitcases, was beckoning toward the door so that she had no time to scan the platform. She bit her underlip.\nWhat if she couldn't stand Jim? What if he wore untidy clothes, and.... And had acquired bad habits!\nWell, she thought, a person can always be honest and say she has made a mistake.\nBut Jim wasn't there!\nThe depot's weathered, splintery old platform was the most deserted, desolate spot she had ever set foot on in all her life! The conductor must have noted her look of horror, for he said calmly, \"We'll be here ten minutes, Miss.\"\nHad she really, deep in her heart, expected Jim to meet her? No. For the first time, she was inclined to agree with her mother's judgment of his character.\nAnn tried to cover her disappointment and surprise from the gaze of the other passengers by walking briskly to the far end of the platform and looking off into the desert. The odor of sagebrush was pleasantly strong. It was the first time she had ever smelled it, but she knew instinctively what it was, and she liked it!\nBut her inner being felt hollow with terror. Had Jim at the very last moment decided that he couldn't face her? She knew that the habits of middle age were hard to fling aside. Perhaps he had suddenly realized the contentment of bachelorhood's unfettered days!\n\"This is western scenery, Ann,\" she told herself. \"Enjoy it!\"\n\nThe sun was shining with a dazzling brilliance on the shimmering prairies stretching for endless miles on either side of the bleak little station. She thought that she had never seen such cloud-dotted blue, blue sky. Miles to the north, purple mountains broke the line of the horizon. Jim once said that he lived north of the railroad.\nA man was hurrying up the track from the big, red water tank, and Ann held her breath. Could that be Jim? But no, this man was small and his hair, under his cap, was snowy white.\n\"Mornin', Ma'am! Can I he'p ya?\" he asked pleasantly.\n\nI was to meet a Mr. James Wallace. But he isn't here. Did you get a message?\" \"No, Ma'am, I ain't seen Jim fer...\" He scratched his tumpled locks in thought. \"Why, I ain't seen Jim fer two weeks come Monday. He come down to get some freight. Kinda fancy stuff, too, 'pears to me!\" he added with a wink. The engine's bell began to clang and great puffs of black smoke darkened the sky. Ann thanked the old man and, with a stiff little smile frozen on her lips, climbed aboard the train and returned to her seat, while the porter brought back her bags. She tried to lose herself in the rhythm of the clicking wheels as the train gathered momentum. Perhaps it was better this way. The years might have done queer things to that lovable boy she had known and adored. It was quite possible that she could hate him as a man! What to do now? Go on forever in the Hallerton Library? She even chuckled at the mental picture of Far Country herself handing out weighty tomes to the literati of Hallerton, dressed in those new western togs folded so neatly in her suitcase, depleting her clothes' budget for a year! The train made another ten-minute stop at Cottonwood, but Ann did not raise the curtain, caring not at all that this was a sizable town of the real West, another part of her dream. Right now she had no taste for a country that could make a man so changeable that he did not know his own mind for more than four days at a time! For Jim's last letter had been ecstatic with anticipation. The vast prairies could be cruel, too, she supposed. The train gathered more miles under itself, nosing out toward the Coast. Ann supposed that something would help her decide what to do in due time. New friends, new hobbies, anything to keep from remembering. The porter roused her, \"You Miss Medford?\" \"Why... Yes, I am.\" Ann straightened with surprise and thought that something dreadful must have happened to her brother and his family back home—her only relatives. THE porter handed her, not a telegram, but a folded piece of paper. \"A gentleman asked me to hand this to you, Miss.\" Jim's writing! All the color drained from Ann's face, and for a moment she could not force herself to read his words for fear of what they might say. Probably the very thing she had reasoned out for herself. He had changed his mind! The porter stood patiently in the aisle, as if waiting for a tip, or an answer, or both. Ann read quickly: Dearest Ann: Heaven doesn't come to me easily, it seems. I was hurt this morning by a horse, not badly, but enough so that my partner had to rush me to Cottonwood where the doctor fixed me up before train time. 'Telegraphed and learned that you were aboard. I'm bedded down in a compartment. Guess you'll have to come all the way, sweetheart. Love, Jim. Ann's big moment was still before her! She trembled and a crimson spot burned in each cheek. Her heart was pounding like a tom-tom as she followed the porter's broad back. At length he paused, then motioned her inside. \"Ann! Oh, little Ann! I knew you'd look just like this.\" Jim's pleasant voice came vibrant and tender from the white pillows. And there was Jim. Her old lovable Jim! A trifle heavier, perhaps. More masculine. She noted that the years had painted his crisp black hair slightly gray at the temples, too; but he seemed the same grand person her daydreams had pictured him. \"Oh, Jim,\" Ann whispered as she dropped down beside him. \"I... I don't know what to say! The past..., Our.... Our future.... Where shall we begin?\" Jim's eyes quirked up in their well remembered old twinkle as he drawled: \"Well, we might start with a kiss....\" and he drew her into his arms.\n\nRemember Pomanders?\nElizabeth Williamson\n\nMaking pomanders isn't a new idea; in fact it is a very old one. Grandmother made them, true, but centuries before her time they were in use. The superstitious peoples of the middle ages wore them on chains around their necks. Instead of the pomander we know, these ancient pomanders were small metal containers beautifully designed. They were worn to ward off the plague and to protect the wearer from contagious diseases. Frequently they contained a tiny book of prayers or spells. Occasionally they held herbs and spices as a scent, that were believed to serve as a disinfectant. By the time the pomander had reached our grandmothers it had changed considerably. The only feature that it had retained was that of furnishing fragrance. Fruit took the place of metal. Its purpose was no longer connected with superstitious belief. Now it served to scent the linens and keep the closets and boxes perfumed.\n\nPomanders are easily made: take an apple (some people prefer oranges or lemons) and cover it with whole cloves pushed in to the head, and sprinkle with cinnamon. Let the pomander dry until the juices evaporate and the fragrance of the spices is absorbed by the fruit. Wrap in cellophane, tie with a pretty ribbon, and you have a lovely and unusual gift.\n\nWayside Rose\nAnna Prince Redd\n\nWhite rose, I cup you in my hand And marvel that you grew Here in the desert, to expand Into a chalice for the dew.\n\nPage 400\n\nLet's Have Cake\nEthel C. Smith\nMember, Relief Society General Board\n\nNow that we are back once more on free and easy terms with our sugar bins, it should not be difficult to answer the challenging query, \"What's for dessert?\" made by the small fry in our families as they gather around the dinner table, their expectant eyes shining from freshly scrubbed faces. If it's to be cake, they will all be delighted, as cake, in its varied forms and flavors, is a favorite of young and old alike. It is also a favorite with the cook because it is so versatile, standing alone on its own merits, or mixing companionably with fruit, ice cream, and various sauces; and it is the perfect accompaniment to punch or a glass of milk. It can be served as a dinner or luncheon dessert, is an old standby as a party refreshment, and behaves well when sent along to school in the lunch box.\n\nThere is an art to turning out a perfect cake, in which many cooks take the same pride and delight that an artist takes in blending colors and capturing a picture on canvas. Cakes may vary in shape—they may be round, oblong, square, or of some more elaborate form—but a perfect cake is always attractive in appearance and of uniform thickness. The crust is delicate brown, thin, tender, and slightly crisp, with no cracks. Perfect cake is light, tender, and moist. It has an even, fine-grained texture and a delicate flavor.\n\nMost experienced cooks prepare some favorite dishes by taste or instinct, using the \"pinch of this and dash of that\" method with excellent results.\n\nIn the matter of cake making, however, there are a few basic rules which must be followed if the desired results are to be forthcoming. There is no doubt that merit in the new so-called \"mix-easy\" method of cake making being suggested by some manufacturers of cake flour, especially where the saving of time is of great importance. Recipes and directions are furnished by the manufacturers in their packages of flour, should you care to try them. However, the real thrill of making a cake comes from beating, blending, and mixing the different ingredients a step at a time, and from the perfect product which will reward the cook who gives the ingredients individual attention and introduces them to each other with due consideration. A culinary triumph is assured the cook who will use a tested recipe and will be guided by the following basic rules: Use Good Ingredients Only; ingredients that are strictly fresh and of good quality should be used if you wish to make a fine cake. The shortening must be of the best quality. There is nothing equal to butter for putting real flavor in a cake, but because of the high cost of butter today, it is sometimes necessary to substitute other shortenings when the recipe calls for butter. The following are equivalent to one-half cup butter: 1/2 cup oleomargarine; 7 tablespoons vegetable shortening; 6 1/2 tablespoons lard; 1 1/2 cups thick cream.Fine, granulated sugar makes a finer-textured cake than coarse sugar. If sugar is coarse or lumpy, it should be sifted and only the finer particles used. Cake flour, which is made from soft, winter wheat, makes a lighter, more tender cake than ordinary all-purpose flour made from the harder wheat. Sponge and angel food cakes demand this lighter cake flour, but very satisfactory butter cakes can be made with all-purpose flour. Cakes containing nuts or fruits are less likely to be crumbly if made with all-purpose flour. If a substitution of all-purpose flour is made when a recipe calls for cake flour, about two tablespoons less to a cup should be used or the cake mixture will be too stiff. You will not have success with sponge or angel food cakes if all-purpose flour is substituted for cake flour.\n\nEggs, milk, and all other ingredients should be strictly fresh and of good quality. Temperature of Ingredients: All ingredients should be allowed to stand until they have assumed normal room temperature before mixing the cake. Measuring: Do not attempt to guess at measurements. All ingredients should be accurately measured with standard measuring cups and spoons. Level off with a spatula or the straight edge of a knife, as measurements are assumed to be level unless otherwise specified. Flour should be sifted before measuring as it has a tendency to settle down and become heavy, and the sifting process mixes air into it. After being sifted, the flour should be spooned into the measuring cup. It should then be resifted with the other dry ingredients called for in the recipe.\n\nMixing: Use either the beating or folding motion for mixing. When using an electric mixer, the beating time should be slightly less than when mixing by hand. Angel and sponge cakes will be lighter if mixed by hand and a wire whisk used. The beating motion should be employed for the first part of the mixing process and the folding motion during the latter part when the flour is added. In butter cakes, the sugar and shortening should be beaten and blended into a light, fluffy, smooth mixture. A round-bottomed bowl is the best type of mixing bowl to use, and if the mixing is done by hand, a wooden spoon is more satisfactory than a metal spoon. When the eggs, or egg yolks, are added, which is generally the next step in the mixing process, they should be beaten vigorously into the sugar mixture. This is the point where your beating will do the most good.\n\nAlternate the dry ingredients and liquid when adding to the mixture, beginning and ending with dry ingredients. A good plan to follow is to add a third of the flour and half of the milk at a time, alternately. As these ingredients are added, the mixing speed should be reduced. At the same time, dawdling is not in order at this point and the mixing should be continuous with no stops. Mix well after each addition, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a spatula or rubber scraper.\n\nIf egg whites are to be added separately from the yolks, they should be stiffly beaten and folded in after the dry ingredients and liquid have been mixed. Nuts and fruits, if called for, come last and should be folded in, after being lightly dredged with flour. The dredging helps them to stick to the dough in the proper places instead of huddling together at the bottom of the pan.\n\nAs soon as the cake is mixed and poured into the pans, it should be whisked into the oven without delay. The light, fluffy mixture which will be the result of your efforts thus far will assume a sad, depressed attitude if kept waiting for the comforting warmth of the oven. If the baking pans haven't been prepared beforehand, or the oven hasn't reached the desired heat, or if you stop to answer the telephone, your cake will get even with you for your neglect by being heavy and sad.\n\nPans in which butter cakes are to be baked should be well greased and lightly floured; but pans for butterless cakes, such as sponge or angel food, should never be greased. Cake pans should be filled two-thirds full and set in, or near, the center of the oven so the cake will bake evenly.\n\nBaking: This is a very important step in cake making. Many fine batters have been ruined in the baking. The oven temperature and time required for baking depend upon the size and kind of cake. For successful baking results, the oven temperature must be uniform, not constantly rising and falling. Most cakes should be baked at a temperature of 350 to 375 degrees. A slightly increased temperature should be used at higher altitudes.\n\nThere are several ways to tell when a cake is done, and it is well to use some of these tests even though the cake has been baked the specified length of time. First, the cake should have finished rising and should have a delicate brown crust; second, the cake should have ceased the \"singing\" sound; third, the cake should have shrunk slightly from the sides of the pan; fourth, the surface of the cake, when pressed lightly with the finger, should spring back and leave no imprint if it is done; fifth, a wire cake tester or a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake should come out clean and dry if the cake is done.\n\nAfter baking, butter cakes should be inverted on a cake rack and allowed to stand for about five minutes before the pan is removed.\n\nIt may be advisable to run a spatula or a knife around the outside of the cake to loosen it from the pan before inverting. Sponge and angel food cakes should not be loosened from the pan while warm, as this will cause them to shrink. They should be inverted and allowed to hang in the pan for one hour, or until cold.\n\nHigh Altitude Baking\nAt high altitude there should be a slight reduction of the baking powder and sugar given in cake recipes and the liquid may need to be increased a little. The baking temperature should be a little higher. This chart for higher altitudes has been found satisfactory: �JUNE 1948 \n3000 to 4000 ft. 4000 to 5500 ft.

Roberts\n\nThe hands of frugal housewives have long preserved the fruits of summer for winter appetites. Why should not then the fingers of the garden lover preserve the blossoms of the season for beauty-hungry eyes, since, as the poet Housman says, \". . . to look at things in bloom, fifty springs are little room.\"\n\nMany flowers may be enjoyed beyond the brief period of their blooming by a bit of careful preparation and the whole family can participate in this pleasurable pastime. Have you ever seen a pressed-flower picture, or, more fun still, have you ever made one? Not only are these pictures delightful variations to hang upon your own walls, but they make charming gifts.\n\nWhen the family become interested, they will, voluntarily, turn collectors and bring home from neighbors, relatives and friends, specimens not found in your own garden. Experimentation will soon prove which flowers hold their form and color best through the process of pressing. But press them in abundance, since the greater the variety of flowers, the more opportunities they afford for the making of satisfactory compositions.\n\nThe making of pressed-flower pictures has extensive possibilities in the field as well as in the commercial field. However, here only a few suggestions are given for those wishing to try a hand at a new hobby. Flowers should be pressed in warm, dry weather, or they tend to lose color and turn brown. They should be picked in their prime and pressed immediately. For this purpose have at hand a number of old books and a few heavy rocks to use as weights. One book will press several flowers. Old volumes may be purchased from used-book counters at small cost for this unscholarly purpose.\n\nRemember the old adage, \"As the twig is bent . . .\" for, as you place the flowers between the leaves of the book, so you will find them shaped when they become dry. Arrange the petals in the most graceful way, with about an inch or more margin at the top and bottom of the page. Then close the book and compress for a moment before placing the next flower. When the book is filled, weight it with a rock or other books and a rock. Let them stand undisturbed until dry—a period of two weeks or more.\n\nSmall rock-garden plants, blue Veronica, white rock-garden spirea, and many others are dainty when pressed. Miniature roses and buds, clusters of climbing rosebuds, the pink ones, especially, are exquisite. Columbine, pinks, larkspur of all colors, Valeriana, small zinnias, and all daisies are good material. Pansies, carefully pressed, are bright and colorful. Sweet peas, especially white ones, are translucent and ethereal. Snapdragons are rich and full-bodied but require special pressure. Delphiniums are particularly delightful to work with, either in flowerets, or using the whole stock, because of their lovely shades of blue. Yellow, pink, and blue hold color well. Some reds and orchids tend to darken slightly.\n\nAs beginners, try pressing types of flowers which are not too heavy, such as large roses, nor too fragile, such as nasturtiums. By the end of your pressing season, you should have gathered, in your spare moments, a few interesting picture frames from dime stores or used-furniture marts. For the beginner, not wishing to make his own frames and not quite ready to attempt large, elaborate pictures, small, quaint, decorative frames are most suitable. A distinctive and inexpensive one is of dark mahogany, about an inch wide, with gilt beading at the inner edge.\n\nOther supplies needed are a few 8 x 12-inch sheets of good drawing paper to use as backgrounds for your flower compositions. When you are ready for the framing, have this equipment at your elbow: a pair of pliers, a supply of small picture framing nails, a spool of thread and, if desired, a few hand-tied bows of pastel colored velvet baby ribbon to place near the stem ends.\n\nWhen flowers and materials are ready, and you have a long, free, sunny day, prepare yourself for an uninterrupted period of delightful concentration. You will find that the children can, with your help, work out some attractive pictures of their own. Prepare frames by drawing out the nails with pliers from the backs of the pictures. Remove the glass and lay it aside until needed, discard the picture of the movie celebrity and keep the cardboard backing. Cut the drawing paper to fit the cardboard and on this drawing paper, fitted over the cardboard, build your picture.\n\nDistribute your beauty crop of pressed flowers carefully over a white sheet on a large table where light is favorable and abundant. Spread the flowers in one layer so that you can see them all at a glance, for you will need to try out many combinations before finding the arrangement that is most pleasing. You will learn to keep each picture in one mood, that is, to select flowers agreeable in size, form and color, upon a harmonizing background. Do not use flowers too sparingly; have a substantial mass of color and pattern on your paper.\n\nFor example, try a group of tiny pink rosebuds and blue delphinium flowerets on a background of white sweet peas and white rock garden spirea with fine blue Veronica at the edges. Build this on a white background, with a perky blue bow laid lightly near the stem ends, if desired. Pansies of varied purples and golds are effective on a pale green or pale orchid background.\n\nWhen you have worked out a pleasing picture, place the glass carefully over it, pressing firmly on the glass with the right hand to hold the flowers in place. With the left hand, gently push the entire picture to the edge of the table so that the glass protrudes about two inches beyond the table edge. Then place the left hand under the protruding edge of the picture and, still pressing the top of the glass with the right hand, turn the entire picture upside down on the table.\n\nNow, pressing the spool against the head of the nail, Page THE GRADUATE NURSE Olive C.

They meet Mother MacKinlay and her son Bob whom they had known while doing missionary work, and also become acquainted with Kathleen Coleman and her friend Margaret Purvis. Hugh and Kathleen are married on board the ship.\n\nAs the early, glimmering dawn softly silvered the Iowa prairies, a camp, with a large central tent surrounded by many smaller tents, was revealed near the banks of a winding stream. Three miles north of Iowa City on a spot where the grass was long and tender, the Woods company had camped the night before. They had come from New York City on the train and now were resting on the land purchased by the Church for the use of emigrants on their long journey to the Salt Lake Valley.\n\nThe men of the Woods encampment were up at daylight. There was work to be done. It was getting late in the year, almost too late to begin a journey to a mountainous country far away—there was no time to lose. The camp life was different from the limited activities of the ship and train, and the emigrants were very grateful for the change. There was fresh, pure air to breathe, clean living quarters, and a variety of food, vegetables and fruit from the farmers' gardens, wild berries growing on the prairies, fish in the streams, and abundant game on every side.\n\nHugh and Andrew brought in dry wood to burn. They knew what the women would call for as soon as they put their heads out of their tent doors, and it wasn't very long until they began appearing like bees coming out of their hives for the day's supply of honey. Then there was a call for prayer, and right after breakfast a priesthood meeting. Everything must be planned and work assigned at once. Some of the men would leave early next day to buy provisions, material for building handcarts, wagons, cattle, horses, and oxen for the trek. All the other men would go to work for the farmers. The women would wash and mend the bedding and clothing.\n\nAndrew came in to dinner. \"Well, Mother Mac, we'll be up and leaving for work at daylight in the morning. The farmers have even asked us over to breakfast.\" \"But not too early in the morning. Sonny, we're having those prairie chickens for supper tomorrow night and the fish for breakfast the next morning.\" \"What prairie chickens? What fish?\" asked Andrew. \"What is going on around here? I thought I was the head of this house?\" \"Not while I'm around, Brother Rumgay. You may have your place, but it isn't preparing the meals. Hugh is out getting the chickens. Father Coleman and Bob are catching the fish.\" \"We hope,\" Andrew returned wistfully. \"Well you just couldn't stay away tomorrow night. 'Tomorrow is Margaret's birthday. She'll be twenty-two years old.\" \"Not so loud, Mother, not so loud, young ladies do not like their ages shouted about. That's why they fix up so much—why Margaret's only a few months younger than I am.\" \"Yes, and she looks it too. Margaret is a very pretty lass, and I'm making a grand birthday dinner for her—saleratus biscuits, breasts of the prairie chickens fried to a turn, gravy, and green corn, crab-apple dumplings, boiled. Now, will you be home for dinner?\" \"Just try and keep me away. How did you catch on to the way of cooking these American dishes? It is plain to see what women talk about when they are alone.\"\n\nBob and Brother Coleman came in with a long string of fish. Also, they had picked a beautiful bouquet of flowers, wild sweet williams, prairie lilies, and windflowers. \"See what I mean, Andrew? These are for the party,\" said Mother Mac. Margaret came over early the next morning to help Mother with the work. \"Happy birthday, my dear, and many happy returns of the day.\" Mother put her arms around the young lady and gave her a good hug and a squeeze for good measure. \"Thanks, dear Mother Mac, you have a heart big enough for the whole world.\"\n\n\"Well, it will be a queer world, Margaret darling, when a mother stops loving her own children. I hope that will never happen to me.\" \"It's a wonderful thing someone can love me,\" Margaret answered.\n\nMother stopped her work. \"Now look here, dearie, you're not building up a lot of heartaches for yourself, are you, now? You know Andrew likes all the girls in the company, Scotch girls, and all the others, but he's in love with Jane, you know that. He'll always be true. V her, so if IT were you I'd forget all about him. There are so many young men in the company, Brother Nelson, Brother Walker, and oh, so many others.\"\n\n\"So many others, and yet when I marry it's going to be to a Scotchman, who will look just like Andrew Rumgay.\" \"Oh, it's so foolish, Margaret, so very foolish.\"\n\n\"So foolish, when I love the very ground he walks on? I didn't know there were men like him in the world. All the men I knew were those who worked in the factory, common, rough, uncouth men, whose ideas of women were the world's concepts. Then I meet a man who puts women on a pedestal, something to be cherished, cared for, loved—I may be foolish, but I will love him till I die.\"\n\nBob and Brother Coleman had brought in a stack of logs for a bonfire. After supper the women washed the dishes, sang songs, played games, and then decided to go to bed. Mother Mac would be up early to fry the fish for the boys before they went to work.\n\nSome of the men had raised the question about going on to the QUESTING LIGHTS Valley this summer. If the fall was about as usual everything would be all right; they would have plenty of time to make it into the Salt Lake Valley.\n\nAndrew came out of the Woods tent into the night's fairy firelight. A beautiful night, a beautiful girl walked over to the fire. \"Where are the others, Margaret? Am I so very late? Did we spoil the party?\" \"No, Mother Mac wanted to get up early to fry the fish. Kathleen was tired, and I am too excited to sleep.\"\n\nI have just now finished my diary, a little dizzy when I think of the rocking of the boat, but on the whole no worse for wear, even when I think of you and the conductor on the train. Andrew—I laugh right out loud each time I think of you and that giant conductor, almost having a fight.\"\n\n\"That was so uncalled for, Margaret. You never make a wrong right by adding another wrong.\"\nMargaret, still laughing, added, \"But you have to figure. Brother Rumgay, that first, last, and all the time, you are a Scotchman. Then all the trimmings come after that—and those Scotch tempers! Oh! Oh!\"\n\"That's one reason the crew were so mean, all along the way, the Scotch pay for their tempers.\"\n\"Well, I see Kathleen left the tent flap open for me, so I'm off to bed. You will need your rest so you can work tomorrow, and you'll need to take it easy the first few days, Andrew, till you get a little used to the work. Good night.\"\nAndrew sat and gazed about him till the fire went out. Night in America—no sound but the babbling of the water, and the rustling of corn in the distance.\nMargaret stayed with Mother while the men were away. Kathleen had Brother Coleman to cook for. He had stayed from the fields to bring water and wood for the women's washings. But the women found both on the banks of the stream. They washed for days and hung their clean white clothes on the bushes.\n\n\"What is more downright satisfying than a pretty, white wash flying in the breeze?\" Mother looked and looked at the clothes. \"You ken, Margaret, they'll be up in the morning that beat the Scotch women 414 washing. The American women's clothes aren't a bit whiter than ours.\"\n\nThat evening they sat around the campfire in deep conversation. Kathleen joined them after supper, and sat down very close to Mother, snuggled up under her arm.\n\n\"I'm going to tell you the sweetest story a woman ever told.\" Kathleen pulled Mother's arm around her for protection, for support. \"We're going to have a baby.\"\n\nMargaret got up and moved to the other side of Kathleen, so they would not need to talk in whispers. This was something special, something sacred.\n\n\"Are you a tiny bit scared, Kathleen, because we are on the plains?\" \n\n\"No, not one bit, Margaret. Other women are having their children, why shouldn't I have mine? Nearly every week a baby is born. Why should I be frightened? Nothing ever happens by chance. God will take care of me and the baby. I wonder if it will be a boy or a girl. If it's a boy we'll call him Andrew, because Hugh and Andrew are such good friends. It it's a girl I'd like to call her after both of you, but how can 1?\"\n\n\"We'd better choose a name your daughter would approve of, Kathleen,\" Margaret suggested.\n\n\"Think how wonderful to have a daughter like you, Margaret! I would like her to be just like you!\"\n\n\"That's the sweetest compliment I was ever paid. Thanks, Kathleen.\"\n\nHugh and Andrew were anxious to learn everything about building handcarts and repairing wagons, so they left the farm work to the others of their ward. It was very hard to get the handcarts ready for the road. The wheels were faulty; material in many instances was poor. Finally, after weeks of hard work, most of the handcarts were ready.\n\nThe day had been spent in packing wagons and handcarts. Tomorrow the mules and ponies would be packed and all would be ready for the trail, but Andrew was still working on his handcart. The wood was so dry and hard that when he thought it was all finished, something else would happen.\n\n\"Look at it, Andrew,\" Hugh said, \"the worst one in the bunch. Why did you choose that one?\"\n\n\"Well, we couldn't leave it behind. We need handcarts so badly and it may as well be mine. I hope it stays with me to the end of the road.\"\n\n\"But you have your doubts. So have I,\" Hugh said as he gave one of the wheels a last hard shake.\n\nThe next morning Brother Woods pulled out with the first wagon. Brother Nelson led with the handcarts, and Brother Rumgay was the last to leave camp.\n\n\"The last, the best of all the game,\" Margaret offered, \"but who wants to be the last one?\"\n\n\"Andrew, you're bothered this morning.\" Mother Mac looked anxiously at him. \"Come now, what's on your mind?\" Andrew tried to smile and pass it off, but Mother was determined.\n\n\"Well, we were told to bring only the necessities, but books have been as necessary to me as my food. I can't take them. There isn't room for them. I'll have to leave them in father's kist.\"\n\n\"If we divide them, and each of us takes a few, Andrew, then we could take them, couldn't we?\" asked Margaret.\n\n\"No, there just isn't room for them. Hugh and I have tried to figure a way out, but it can't be done. Every tiny space must be used for food. A handcart isn't very large, you know, and if it's too heavy it will be too hard to pull. Lots of other things to worry about, but I've never been without my books.\"\n\n\"We all love them, don't we, Hugh?\" Kathleen added, in sympathy.\n\n\"Yes, we recall my sick days aboard the ship, and the help and consolation they brought us,\" Hugh spoke gratefully.\n\n\"Well, maybe someone who appreciates books will find them. They may prove to be good missionaries.\" Margaret was trying to add a note of cheer.\n\n\"I'll look around and see that everything is taken care of. You folks go on up the line. No need for us all to stay behind,\" Hugh suggested.\n\nBob and Brother Coleman went with Andrew to see that all the fires were out and nothing was left behind. Everything was in order. Now they could All take to, the road.\n\nTHEY spent the first hours getting adjusted to pulling their handcarts. Even in this they found there was a great art. They passed many sloughs and swamps, and had to be very careful to stay on the road. The corn, just coming into tassel, reminded the saints of the quick passing of the summer days.\n\n\"The fields of growing corn, dependent on the sun and the rain for their growth, suggest to me our 415 dependence upon our Heavenly Father,\" Kathleen said.\n\n\"Yes,\" Margaret replied, \"and if God cares for the corn in the field, and provides for its welfare, how much more can his children trust him for their security, even on a Strange road in a strange country.\"\n\n\"God is taking care of us, I'm sure,\" affirmed Mother Mac. \"I have felt his helpful influence many times since leaving home.\"\n\nThat night Mother, Margaret, and Kathleen came hobbling into camp. They went over to the creek, removed their shoes and stockings, and soaked their feet in the cool water.\n\n\"What a relief!\" Margaret cried, giving vent to a heavy sigh. Kathleen was worried. \"What on earth will we do, walking every day, and our feet in this condition?\" \"Nature is a wonderful doctor,\" Mother assured her: \"In a day or two our feet will be better than ever, strong for the strain and exercise they must take.\" But the women were late with supper that night and could hardly have managed at all without the help of Brother Coleman. Andrew and Hugh worked on the handcarts that had broken down during the day. Bob helped with the herding, spreading out the horses and cattle as far as possible, so they would get in enough grazing before dark. The grass was abundant, and the animals tired and hungry after their first day's full haul.\n\nEach day the emigrants traveled more miles, and their muscles seemed to adjust themselves to the strain and work of the road, for, as Mother Mac said, \"Nature is a wonderful friend to take with you on a journey.\" Each day they were hungry and ready for their food. They constantly breathed the clean, pure air of the prairies and it was not long before even the old men and women could take the day's advance in comfort. They left the cabins and corn and all cultivation behind them. Their way was through miles of prairie, with only nature's primitive gifts of land and sky. Silence lay before them, behind them, and was with them every moment.\n\nOne day Margaret said, \"Even the people have become silent. It seems that there is nothing to be said. Behind us lie our yesterdays marked by a tuft of grass, a tree, or a creek of water. Before us lie our tomorrows, rising each day from the bed the sun has used the night before to sleep in.\"\n\n\"Yes, even I have been quiet longer than for anytime in my life,\" Mother responded. \"Every mile and every hour are filled with the throbbing rhythm of the land and the ever-changing pictures in the sky. The atmosphere is heavy-laden with beautiful thoughts, but no words.\" \"The birds are satisfied to fly from tree to tree. They may sing to their young, but we do not hear them.\"\n\nKathleen was expressing the longing of her heart. Margaret was thinking that perhaps the silence of the land was the expression of the future. A lovely dream that could have become a reality would always lie dormant and silent because the love she longed for would be claimed by another. She thought of the homes that some day would be built upon these silent acres in response to the plow and the farmer's song, awakening the land and bringing the vibrant voices of happy children to the melody of busy reapers.\n\nAs they passed silently on towards night, clouds appeared in the west. (To be continued)\n\nSONG FOR A DAUGHTER\nMargery S. Stewart watched you running across the road From school, like a blown leaf or flower, Tree shadows on your face.\nYou paused To shake the lilac, laughing under shower Of cupped rain. How tall you seemed, How frail your fingers and how bright Your hair. Childhood gone, like laughter Lost...\nYears out of sound and sight.\nIn the sun, holding your face to summer, I watched you turn and bend. You called my name and in your voice I heard The love of friend for friend.\n\nFROM THE FIELD\nMargaret C.

Sister Rudd comments: \"Note the old checkered tablecloth, the coal oil lamp, the great ornate Bible, the picture of the Prophet, and the authentic costumes of the sisters. The group found Emma Smith to be greatly worried over the sufferings of her husband, incarcerated in jail, but the other women consoled her. They read letters received from the Prophet. Later, two sisters dropped in on their way from singing practice. They were urged to sing and agreed, providing Sister Kimball would accompany them on the organ. This she did while they sang \"Jesus, Lover of My Soul\" and the Prophet's beloved hymn \"A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief.\" With this music, the Nauvoo sisters again departed into the past. Then the literature class discussed, with deepened appreciation, that great soul, Joseph Smith and his inspiring letters.\"\nAnnie Perkins is literature class leader in Evergreen Ward and Vessa Marler wrote the dramatization.

I gave one look and knew it was not for me.\n\nTHAT night, more in desperation than in hope, we rode by the Lomas house. It was lighted, and after much bell ringing and waiting, we were admitted. The owner was there, assisted by three maids. Feverishly she told us that an American doctor, with no children, would occupy the house manana en la manana. We went quietly out. It was Thursday morning and I had one place left, an apartment far out. It was occupied by an American lady who was moving soon, the agency said.\n\nThe lady received me; the apartment was all that one could wish, even to the lovely hued Mexican hand-woven rugs and the blonde furniture. There was only one drawback: the lady would not vacate until she could find a house for the same price. She had been looking for six months. The end of my list had been reached.\n\nThere were still some apartments in the heart of the town, but we were not going to investigate them, even as a last resort. I made a quick decision. Calling to the driver, I showed him the address on Aguas Calientes. \"Si, Senora,\" he said, wheeling his car about. The Senora was home and she led me into the walled garden. This time I did not allow her to lead the conversation. I sat firmly on the cold tile seat and asked if we could have the house."

    "content": "Relief Society Building News\n\nAS the time of the conclusion of the Relief Society Building fund-raising campaign of one year draws to a close, more and more the members of Relief Society are viewing this great undertaking as a blessing and an opportunity. Different stake and ward officers testify of the love and unity which have resulted among the sisters through working together.\n\nThe following excerpts from a letter from Sister Brinton, President of the Maricopa Stake Relief Society, gives expression to the wonderful accomplishments of the sisters of the Page Ward in co-operation with other:\n\nI want to write to you about our Papago Ward. I think there are few stakes in the Church that have an Indian ward and a Spanish ward. These were the ones I worried about with out building fund— ——\n\nI talked to President Wright and asked him to go with me to the Papago Ward. We both spoke and explained the program, and he suggested a banquet.\n\nThen Lorenzo Wright was released and his son Harold made out stake president. ——\n\nWe called a meeting of our Relief Society sisters, their bishop, President Wright, Ex-President Wright, and the stake board. When they found we were going ahead with this, they all helped in every way possible. The bishop gave twenty every week. The rest of the board have helped often.\n\nThe sisters made many beautiful articles to be sold: four quilts appliqued, one pieced, baby quilts, aprons, dresses, dish towels, hot pad holders and many other useful things. They have really worked. Twenty seven are enrolled and twenty-two were there most every week. Some of them walk three miles to their meetings.\n\nTwo sisters who are old and nearly blind have made pot holders on a frame and have enjoyed doing it so very much. Our sisters helped plan the dinner, helped with the cooking and serving. We took charge of it. The M.I.A. girls served; they were so cute wore white blouses with dark skirts and made white crepe aprons for each one. The boys helped with the serving and they were really good.\n\nBlinder who is a senior in high school, took charge of the decorations. He had three men help him and they did a fine job of it. The flower arrangement was very fine. 'The women made green crepe paper flounces on pint bottles for vases. It was interesting to watch them and see the art with which they work.\n\nI have never seen them so interested in anything before.\n\nClaudina, their Y.W.M.I.A. President, planned the program. It was all Indian and very fine. The program lasted about an hour. It was well worth the money without the dinner—violin solos, duets, quartets, stories, and Indian dances. We planned on serving two hundred and served more than three hundred. We had to send out and get cake and ice cream to give the ones that helped. It was a real thrill to me and they are so happy and so proud that they could do it.\n\nThe money is such a small part of the good that has been done.\n\nThanks for the opportunity to help these people.\nMartina Schurtz, our Papago president, lives in Mesa and works at a cleaners. She misses work every Monday and goes to her meetings. That means eight dollars a week or thirty-two dollars a month to attend Relief Society. That is a lot for anyone to give but for an Indian woman who works for a living, I feel she is making more of a sacrifice than anyone else I know.\n\nAfter sending the $135 to you they will have over $200 left to get something for their association. We are anxious for them to get a good electric machine, an iron, and cabinets to keep their things in.\n\nOur Spanish ward had a banquet or Spanish dinner to raise their fund. Some gave the five dollars but so many could not. They all helped with it and it was very fine.\n\nJosephine Mortensen is a very splendid person and a real leader. They were the first ward to go over the top and of course were very proud of it.\n\nMable King, our music leader, helped with their program and it was very good.\n\nAt our Papago dinner President Lorenzo Wright paid honor to Josephine our Spanish president as we did not have a chance at their program. They work so hard and have many difficulties to overcome that we do not have in our other wards.

    "content": "Here Comes the Parade\n\nGrace A. Woodbury\n\nALWAYS on the Fourth or Twenty-fourth of July just as the sun came up over the low volcanic ridge east of our town, the cannon on Red Hill boomed, practically shaking the townfolk out of bed. Then the band began to play, \"The Star Spangled Banner\"; the flag was run up on the liberty pole; the cannon boomed again; small boys began to shout, and the nerve-racking pop of firecrackers began. The glorious day of celebration, with its noise, its crowds, sports, program, and parade was ushered in with the enthusiasm found only in small towns. But it was the parade that highlighted the day for us youngsters.\n\nOf course, the program, held in the stake tabernacle, was all right for the grown folks, but to us, it seemed long and dry. Only the lemonade that was passed around to the thirsty audience in new tin cups seemed worthwhile to us. Of course, running races in the afternoon under the trees on the Square was fun for awhile, with candy and prizes for all the children, but unbelievable as it seemed, you could get full of candy, and carrying what you couldn't eat around in your warm damp hands was a sticky business when the temperature reached a hundred and eight in the shade! But the parade! That was something to behold. We could not wait for it to reach us, so we all raced up the street to meet it.\n\nSuch a grand sight—flags, bands, floats, and leading it all was the Marshall of the Day riding on his fine horse. All the rest of the year he was called \"Bishop,\" but on the holiday he was addressed as \"Captain.\" When I asked my mother the reason, she said that he used to be a famous Indian fighter. That information changed him, as far as I was concerned, into a heroic figure, mounted on a noble, high-stepping steed, going forth into battle.\n\nFollowing him came the martial band, riding in a double-bed wagon, draped with red, white, and blue bunting, and drawn by horses with little flags stuck in their bridles. It seemed to me that they stepped in time to the music of the fife and drums. Then came several more men on horses.\n\n\"Who are they?\" I asked my mother.\n\n\"The dignitaries,\" she answered.\n\nOf course I then asked, \"What are dignitaries?\"\n\n\"Oh, the mayor, the sheriff, the city and county commissioners.\"\n\n\"What do they do?\" I persisted.\n\n\"They govern the town, point with pride, and view with alarm,\" she answered. \"But you had better stop asking questions, look what is coming!\"\n\nEveryone gasped with admiration as the beautiful float bearing the Goddess of Liberty and her attendants moved slowly down the street. To me those lovely girls in their long, white, star-trimmed robes and tinsel crowns were something out of this world.\n\nThe next float also brought ahs Page 445-446 and ohs from the crowd, for Miss Utah, surrounded by girls representing all of the states of the Union, was worthy of the admiration and applause she received. I was so happy to see my pretty Sunday School teacher on the float, dressed in white and wearing a sash tied diagonally across her breast on which was printed in gold letters Idaho. I wondered if when I grew up I would be chosen to represent a state; and a few years later I was, but the letters that my mother carefully stitched on my sash spelled Vermont, and I was vaguely disappointed, for I had always imagined myself as representing Idaho.\n\nThe most acclaimed float of them all was a hayrack covered with hay, flags, and dozens of small children who sang, \"Zion is Growing.\" The hayrack swayed and bumped down the unpaved, dusty street. Rippling along each side was a banner made of unbleached muslin (\"factory\" to us), proclaiming that these children were \"Utah's Best Crop.\" Once my youngest sister was chosen to be one of the sprouts, shall we say, that made up the \"Crop,\" and my pride in her was so great that I scarcely noticed the other children on the float. The horses drawing the next entry, a covered wagon, kept snatching wisps of hay from the \"Best Crop\" float, which made the children squeal in delighted fright; but the man who drove the team represented a pioneer crossing the plains, and he kept trying to hold his horses back so that they couldn't reach the hay, but his wife and children, also dressed as pioneers, enjoyed the situation, and one of the small boys called, \"Let 'em go, Pa, it'll save our hay.\" Tethered behind the wagon was a milk cow, trudging wearily along, her eyes rimmed with dust and her tail switching constantly in an effort to keep off the torturing flies.\n\nHERE COMES THE PARADE! HERE COMES THE PARADE\n\nThe GODDESS OF LIBERTY AND HER ATTENDANTS\n\nHow I wished that she could have some of the hay those smarty horses were stealing. \"Now here comes something very high-toned,\" I heard my Aunt May say, and so it was—a shining surrey with fringe hanging elegantly from the top. Riding in it were some of the pioneers of 1847, wearing their very best clothes and the large gold pins that had been given to them at the grand celebration in Salt Lake City in 1897—Utah had been settled fifty years. I wished that my grandfather could have had a beautiful golden pin even if he didn't come to Utah until 1852. Oh, well, I consoled myself, he could write poems about everything, building the temple, digging ditches, why he had a song in the Sunday School hymn book called \"Dearest Children, God Is Near You,\" and wasn't a poem that he had written about these very pioneers going to be read in meeting today? The blaring of the brass band brought my wandering thoughts back to the parade. They were playing \"Hail Columbia, Happy Land\" with such enthusiasm as to raise the dust, anyway there was lots of dust. And right behind the band came a white-topped, light wagon in which the few surviving members of the Mormon Battalion were riding. It took a lot of imagination to visualize these white-haired, stooped-shouldered old men as strong, firm-footed young soldiers who could march halfway across a continent. Yet, for a brief moment that morning, I had seen our old neighbor, who was now riding with his comrades in the \"white top,\" straighten his bent shoulders and give a snappy salute to the martial band that was serenading him.\n\nBut the parade was almost over—just two more features. A float—\"Utah's First Settlers\"—had an Indian wickiup surrounded by rabbit brush and mesquite boughs and Indians, kindly old Jim (the patriarch of the Shivits tribe), Old Snow, and Yellowjacket, their squaws, and Little Jim and Sally and their son Smoky. Many of the townspeople called to them, \"Agua pike way, where are you going?\" But the Indians didn't respond by so much as a glance in their direction. They just sat in stolid and dignified silence and ignored the entire town.\n\nMy attention was last of all turned to the queer, old two-wheeled cart, drawn by a long-suffering donkey, that brought up the rear of the parade. The driver was dressed in a loud plaid suit much too large for him and wore a derby hat that sat on his ears. When he wasn't prodding the donkey to keep him moving, he played \"In the Good Old Summer Time,\" \"Two Little Girls in Blue,\" and \"Yankee Doodle\" on his harmonica. A banner stretched across the back of the cart read \"Salt Lake Valley or Bust.\"\n\nEverybody laughed and the donkey suddenly stopped in his tracks with a \"rocks will fly from their firm base as soon as I\" gleam in his eye.\n\n\"Tickle his ear,\" called someone from the crowd, \"Roll on the hind wheels,\" advised another. \"Build a fire under him!\"\n\nIt seemed everyone but the driver knew what should be done. Suddenly, before he had time to carry out any of the ridiculous suggestions, the little donkey realized that his parade was going on without him, and moved so suddenly that his driver almost lost his derby.\n\nWe children also noticed that the parade was leaving us, and we ran down the street and around the corner so that we could see it all over again when it came out on the next street.\n\nINVENTION\n\nClarence Edwin Flynn\n\nI'm working on a project That should enrich my purse, A gear for clocks and watches To put them in reverse.\n\nSo many gray-haired people, With faded, weary eyes, Have asked me to complete it. \"Hurry,\" they say, \"time flies.\"\n\nNo, do not be too sanguine, In candor I confess, I've not yet been rewarded With any great success."

    "content": "The Seventh Handcart Company\n\nAnna S. D. Johnson\n\nI looked upon the monument recently erected on Temple Square, Salt Lake City, honoring the ten handcart companies, I was deeply moved, for it symbolized faith and hope and brought to memory the privation and suffering of the Seventh Handcart Company in which many stalwart and faithful people came to Salt Lake Valley. In the summer of 1850, Apostle Erastus Snow, with three other missionaries, went to Europe to open the Scandinavian mission. Five young men, three born in Copenhagen and two nearby, all between the ages of eighteen and twenty-two, became very much interested in this new and different religion called Mormonism. They attended the first meeting with renewed spirit, and then, after about three months, three of these young men were converted and baptized. Before another year passed the other two boys also joined the Church. Being of strong character, they were anxious to do whatever was asked of them. President Snow set them apart as: local missionaries to travel without purse or scrip to preach the gospel in Denmark and Norway.\n\nDuring the five to seven years they spent as missionaries, they were mobbed, thrown into prison, and went through much persecution. But, despite these hardships, they converted many. The greatest joy of their lives was realized when they were released to come to Zion, bringing with them their fiancées and families whom they had converted. These young men planned to be married upon reaching the Great Salt Lake Valley, but when they arrived in Liverpool, they discovered that Elder John Kay was returning to Zion on the same boat, The Westmoreland, with them, and it was unanimously decided that he should marry the young couples before setting sail. What a thrilling romance to be married in such a manner! Mr. Deacon, captain of The Westmoreland, did his share in making a pleasant reception on the ship. About 500 saints and emigrants were aboard. Most of the passengers were friends and converts, happy with the thought of coming to Zion, and all joined in a joyous outburst of song and hurrahs in congratulation to these five young couples. The crossing took thirty-six days. The emigrants landed up the river near the Philadelphia shore. What happiness they expressed as they touched their feet on American soil! A diary of 1857 states: They then traveled until they came to a place below Iowa City which was green and lovely, with a spring nearby. Here they were met by President John Taylor, who gave them instructions on how to prepare for the trek across the plains. How little they knew what lay before them! All was joyous and, after three weeks' preparation, they were hurrying on their way, knowing the fate of the Fifth and Sixth Handcart Companies.

Forever in remembrance let them be, 'Who gave their all for truth and liberty. Orson F. Whitney Companies of the previous year which were not well prepared, and started out too late in the season and were caught in the winter blasts on the plains, many of whom had perished before help came. The Seventh Company, consisting of 334 persons, left Iowa on July 3, 1857. These young couples were light-hearted and gay, singing around the campfires, dancing, holding meetings, and praying together mornings and evenings. However, the trip was arduous and soon food had to be rationed and often they had to go more than a day without water. Then came great thunderstorms. They still trudged on. Such privation and physical endurance was unknown to them. They climbed up and down heavy sand hills and tried to follow the covered wagon trails. Then, besides these troubles, there were the ditches, streams, and creeks which must be waded. The most dangerous place was at Loup Fork where the stream was a mile wide. Here the children were placed in the handcarts but the water came up in the carts and frightened the children. Two ox teams carried the old and sick. The women clung together and got across as best they could. The Indians came to their assistance, but yet it took two days to cross the stream. After crossing Loup Fork, the walking was hard and many times one or more would have to drop at the wayside because they were too weak to go on. The trials seemed almost beyond human endurance, but the saints had spirit and courage, and they traveled on to reach their goal. At Wood River, one of the mothers left camp and, with the help of devoted friends, gave birth to a baby girl and returned to camp the following morning, carrying the child in her apron, and continued on the trek. Indeed it was a strenuous journey, as one-tenth of the company died. Yet the only time my mother mentioned the hardships was when her shoes wore out and she used burlap around her swollen, bleeding feet to protect them from the thin ice that had formed on the streams. Many had torn, bare feet when they arrived. For three weeks they were without meat, and not one of them dared kill a buffalo for fear of a stampede. This was understandable, for none of the company was much used to firearms. As they were traveling, many unusual things occurred. Of much interest was the Johnston Army of 1857, traveling on the other side of the Platte River with their bountiful supply of everything. What they thought of this poor handcart company will never be known, but one day one of the army officers approached the handcart camp and said very kindly that one of their oxen had had its foot crushed and if they cared for the (Continued on page 501) From a painting by C.

We are different to the world; they have no revelation to guide them which we claim to have, and if we write or say anything that is not according to truth and righteousness, those who are over us (being placed there by the Lord) can soon detect an error, and so can those in the Church who may read and learn what we say, for those who do right all see eye to eye. Let us pray for our brethren and sisters who are over us in the Lord, who are ever on the watchtower, for we are told to do so, and it is a pleasant duty for us, so let us be friends to each other, trying to overcome everything wrong, that we may be as the wise virgins, having oil in our lamps, not copying after the world—Mary A. Freeze FROM OGDEN: On Thursday, July 19th, there will be an Anniversary Meeting in Ogden, at the Tabernacle, to commemorate the last visit of Pres. Brigham Young to that city, and also to celebrate the first appointment of a President to preside over the sisters' organizations in a Stake capacity. Pres. Young, at the meeting in the Ogden Tabernacle, July 19, 1877, appointed Mrs. Jane S. Richards President over the Relief Society and Young Ladies' Associations in all Weber Stake, and said quarterly reports were to be given of the condition of each Society, and gave much valuable instruction at that time. Pres. Young in his remarks said, concerning the mothers: \"Mothers are the moving instruments in the hands of Providence to guide the destinies of nations,\" and he exhorted mothers to teach their children not to make war, but to teach them peace.\n\nHe asked the question, \"Who gives the key to the nations of the earth? It is the mothers!\" His instructions were most fatherly, and it seemed as though every one present felt the influence thereof. It was the last time he spoke to the Relief Society and Retrenchment Associations, and it seems most proper to commemorate the event.\n\nARISE! SHINE! FOR THY LIGHT IS COME!\nArise! Arise!

It is a duty that each woman owes to her family and to society—to be cheerful and pleasant, courteous and friendly, neat and cleanly in her personal habits.\n\nI would say to the daughters of Zion, be humble and prayerful in order to retain the Holy Spirit to direct our minds, our words, our deeds, that we may be worthy the name of true, noble women—daughters of God.\n—Truth Page 452\nWoman's Sphere\n\nRamona W.

Snow Poem Contest.\n\nPage 453\n\nEDITORIAL\nVol. 35 JULY 1948\n\nShrift as a Way of Life\nLATTER DAY Saint women have been given the priceless heritage of thrift. From frugal New England housewives, from industrious European homemakers, from wise pioneer women who loved their homes and considered work a privilege, has come this tradition of thrift. It is a most wholesome and valuable combination of industry and economy, and may be explained as the unusual ability to do without—to make things do or to make them over—to create something from nothing, as the saying goes.\n\nThe heritage of thrift, which was a necessity for survival in pioneer days, is still of great worth and is the mark of a good housekeeper even in our mechanized civilization. The criterion so well defined in Proverbs (31:10-31) is still applicable to all women, even to those who live in cities, for thrift is, as explained in scripture, a virtue of many phases, embodying particularly the wise selection and securing of life's necessities and a careful use of everything.\n\nA virtuous woman seeketh wool and flax, a worketh willingly with her hands. She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar. She riseth while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household.... She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.... She is not afraid of the snow... For all her household are clothed with scarlet.\n\nPage 454\n\nExamples of pioneer thrift, many of which apply equally well to the troubled days in which we live, are numerous. \"Take, for instance, the father's outworn suit or the mother's unfashionable coat. What happened to them? They were made into trousers and a jacket for the young son or into a skirt and coat for a growing girl. Then, again, the same material was used for a still smaller child. Eventually the original article of clothing found its way into a quilt, a rug, or into the covering (or stuffing) for a chair. Even the final scraps of a ragged rug became part of a mattress or a cushion. At times, even thread was saved and no buttons or fasteners were discarded.\n\nThe long series of articles made from one piece of material were neither ugly nor cheap looking, but were made lovingly, with much attention to fine detail. And the bread which the industrious homemaker prepared for her family—what was the process there? Whole-wheat flour (often ground at home) was used, and when the brown loaves had been slowly baked they were (and still may be) a great delicacy. Dry bread was never wasted. If not used with milk or in soup, it was ground and kept handy for toppings on baked dishes, for making dressing, or for use in puddings.\n\nSoap making was another pioneer art which is still useful. Very few homemakers who do not throw away enough fats and grease to provide at least part of the necessary laundry soap. And soapmaking is not a difficult process, and it is fun to do.\n\nThe creative and constructive abilities of women find satisfying expression in securing, preserving, and using the necessities of life—in making an art of homework. The home and its surroundings are a wide and wonderful world, filled with infinite possibilities.\n\nTo paraphrase Proverbs, if you would find a happy woman, look for one who is busy in the ways of thrift, who considers homemaking an opportunity for the development of many skills. Who maketh herself coverings of tapestry... She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.\" V. P. C.\n\nBirthday Greetings to Sister Augusta (Winters Grant Age ninety-two). Church and honored as a leader among her people, Sister Grant has lived a full, rich life and has contributed liberally of her means, her gifts, and her talents to increase the happiness of others. All of the great blessings which may come to a woman have been most bountifully bestowed upon Sister Grant and she has regarded each blessing as an opportunity for growth and development and the enrichment of her gracious personality.\n\nDaughter, wife, mother, grandmother, great-grandmother—these words which represent the important phases of life for a woman—all apply to Sister Grant. And more have been added—teacher, friend, companion—an ideal Latter-day Saint woman who well deserves that treasured title.\n\nOn this anniversary, Relief Society women everywhere, and many other well-wishers and friends, extend to Sister Grant heartfelt greetings for this her natal day and for all the days to come.\n\nThree-Part Story to Begin in August\n\n\"The Russells Did Not Go to Church,\" a three-part story by Edith Russell, will begin in the August issue of the Magazine. A vital and thought-provoking narrative of the spiritual aspirations of a young girl and her search for religious truth, this contribution to Latter-day Saint literature will constitute the first appearance in our Magazine of a young English author of great promise who is now making her home in Utah.\n\nEditorial 455\n\nFlower Arrangements for Summer Days\nVesta P. Crawford\n\nSUMMER brings a rich array of colorful blossoms, offering such exquisite variety in form and color that many different floral compositions may be designed. Remember that it is better to use a few flowers in any arrangement than to bunch them closely. Lightness and grace are fundamental to the perfection of a floral symphony.\n\nMany homemakers who have a special gift for color appreciation find that a flower arrangement which uses different tones of the same color is a delightful diversion. Pale pink roses as the center of interest, combined with deeper pink gypsophila or forget-me-nots, make a bouquet that will not soon be forgotten. One tall spike of deep pink delphinium might add grace to such an arrangement.\n\nIt is a delight to use the various tones of blue, or blue with white, for summer designs. For a regal design of dignified formality, use gladioli, being most careful to cut the stems in various lengths so that the topmost buds will be graduated.\n\nPoints of Interest for Summer Flowers\nW.

They meet Mother MacKinlay and her son Bob, whom they had known while doing missionary work, and become acquainted with Kathleen Coleman and her friend Margaret Purvis. Hugh and Kathleen are married on board the ship.\n\nWhile in Iowa preparing for the handcart journey across the plains, Margaret tells Mother Mac that she is in love with Andrew, and Kathleen informs them that she is expecting a baby.\n\nMARGARET looking questioningly at the sky, reechoed some ship lore: \"Red skies at night, the sailor's delight. Red skies in the morning, a sailor's warning.\"\n\nMother Mac tried to appear unaffected by such dark forebodings. \"I'm not so sure that those heavy clouds are not the emigrants' warning. Oh, well, there must always be some change in the weather,\" she added.\n\nIt rained all night and was still raining the next morning. As always, the handcarts and wagons needed repairs. The company decided to wait a few hours and let the animals graze further away from camp as grass had been scarce for several days. The women caught up with their mending. Mother Mac, with Margaret's help, cooked a boiled dinner. How much it was appreciated was expressed in the amount they did not leave on their plates.\n\n\"My only wish,\" Hugh spoke very gratefully, \"is that every family going across the plains could have a Mother Mac to help them out.\"\n\n\"If they haven't, we'll loan them Margaret.\" Andrew smiled a most tormenting smile at the lady in question. \"We neither borrow nor lend,\" Mother Mac spoke up quickly, \"and if Margaret were loaned, not one of you should eat a bite until she was returned.\"\n\n\"Then we'll keep Margaret,\" Andrew laughed.\n\n\"How very much a man loves his stomach,\" Margaret rejoined as she began gathering up the dishes.\n\n\"Oh, we'll keep Margaret, all right,\" Mother Mac returned with finality. \"And now, Bob, get some dry wood so we can heat some water for the dishes.\"\n\n\"One more wagon, two more cart wheels, and we'll be on our way. Better hurry those dishes if you're going with us.\" Andrew patted Mother's shoulder tenderly, but sometimes he loved to tease.\n\n\"We'll be ready,\" Hugh added. \"You never wait for the Mac women.\"\n\n\"And no other women either,\" Hugh added. \"If the men were only on the job as much as the women are, things would move along all right.\"\n\nAfter helping with the dishes, Margaret stood in the tent door, viewing the landscape. She felt closer to nature after a storm. Everything was nearly dry, although it was still very muddy. Near their tent a stream was running, filled to the top of its banks with the storm's overflow. Its song was gay, noisy, inviting.\n\nMargaret walked to the lone tree on its bank. She became interested. She looked at the tree for a long time. The storm had left it in tears; it had a strange appeal.\n\n\"Margaret!\" Mother called. \"Margaret!\"\n\nMargaret could see that the company was on the move. She ran for her cart, but turned to take a last look at the tree. A gentle breeze was shaking its branches; the sun was drying its tears.\n\n\"How wonderful are nature's children, how kind,\" she remarked aloud as she turned to her handcart.\n\nThe company was eager to hurry on its way.\n\nThe tang of autumn was in the air, with the nights and mornings growing cooler, but for a while the days were perfect for travel. Then, as the season advanced and the days shortened, there were more and more storms, lashed by cold winds. Bad weather slowed down the march, and, in spite of care and earnest watchfulness, the Indians were stealing the cattle. About fifteen in all had been stolen, good, sturdy animals which had carried much of the supplies. This freight now had to be transferred to the handcarts and wagons. In order that the food supply could be carried on the handcarts, the heaviest clothing had to be discarded. This was a heavy blow to the saints.\n\nOne windy, bitter cold day they arrived at a fort and prepared to weld and mend some of their broken down handcarts and creaking wagons. Several more days were lost and the autumn winds swept the vast plains. The women dug deep into their hearts and handcarts. At different places along the trail they had bought grain and potatoes. This fort would be the last place they could buy food.\n\nThey took tiny gold lockets hanging on fragile chains around their necks, close to their hearts, and gave all their valuable treasures to balance the exchange with the storekeepers. One night, several weeks after leaving the fort, the emigrants stood on the banks of the Platte. The day had been dark and dreary. Through mists and purple haze the mountains stood as a challenge.\n\nAndrew and Hugh gazed across the stream as the shadows darkened. They held out the palms of their hands. It was beginning to snow. Kathleen and Margaret were astounded, and as the snowflakes whitened their carts, Kathleen burst into tears. Mother and Bob finally got the fire to burning.\n\n\"I've never seen anything yet that a little faith, and a lot of perseverance wouldn't cure,\" Mother said. \"Common sense told me that the fire wouldn't burn, so I used a little plan on the unusual order. I said a little prayer or two. See how it helps. There's our fire, just as bright as it will ever need to be.\"\n\nKathleen dried her tears. Margaret began making up the beds and the men went to their work.\n\nAlthough there was a good fall of snow in the morning, the company began the trek early. There were good days and there were bad days. 462 When the weather was fair and warm they went ahead rapidly; when it was stormy and cold they did not make much progress.\n\nThen came another very cold day. The snow, which began falling in the forenoon, kept up until nearly dark. The winds blew the loose snow into the trail, and walking was almost impossible. The people were nearly exhausted when they got to camp. The animals were corralled early, supper was cooked, and everyone went to bed as soon as the work was done.\n\nAndrew took the first part of the night for herding. He came in about midnight, threw some logs on the fire, and sat down to wait for Hugh to come on shift. They had to stand guard constantly over the cattle so that the Indians could not steal them.\n\nMother could not sleep. She arose and made a cup of ginger tea for Andrew. The clouds had cleared away, and one by one the stars began appearing in the sky.\n\n\"Mother, I wish you would stay in your bed. You'll catch cold on a night like this. You're something special—take care of yourself,\" Bob said.\n\n\"Will, son, but the moon and stars are so beautiful tonight after our hard day.\" \"What about the snow on the earth beneath the stars? I declare I can't raise my eyes above these drifts.\"\n\n\"There's another emigration company above us. They remind me of our camp in Iowa, a large tent and all the smaller tents. Their lights are bright. The sisters must clean the chimneys, and fill their lamps with coal oil every day,\" Andrew said.\n\n\"Yes, I see what you mean. I wish our lights were as bright tonight,\" Mother said.\n\n\"They are. No storm can dim our lights. 'The candles of the wise virgins shine brightest in the dark.'\"\n\nNext day the sun was shining, and it was warm in the forenoon. Noon. In the afternoon clouds began to gather and the wind howled along the pass. In the evening the wind switched to the north and snow began to fall. The temperature dropped. A blizzard whirled over the camp and the people were hardly able to move. It grew colder every minute.\n\nThe well helped the sick; the strong helped the weak. Many handcarts were left frozen in the trail. Toward midnight relief came. The winds died down, and the people pitched their tents and built their fires. Many graves were left on the hillside. But if their needs were great, their blessings were also great.\n\nThe Lord waited in that valley with the emigrants by night, and many times they felt that the veil between them and their Heavenly Father was very thin. His peace and comfort restored them, and led them back into the road to Zion.\n\nThe days grew shorter as they approached the mountains. One cold day, as it began to grow dark, they made camp. Bob and Brother Coleman set up tents and made beds so that the women could get some rest. Margaret urged Mother and Kathleen to lie down while she started supper. She was busy preparing the meal when it occurred to her that she had not seen Andrew come in.\n\nThere was a rule that each person should report just as soon as camp was made. Margaret set the food to one side and went in search of Andrew. She made the rounds, and came back to the tents. Mother and Kathleen were asleep. Bob and Brother Coleman were herding the cattle and Hugh was helping with a wagon that had broken down.\n\nMargaret waited. Surely Andrew would come soon. But he did not come. Time was precious; the trail would be filled up with snow. Her duty suddenly was clear to her. Andrew was out on the trail. When it grew cold, the heavy snow would be hard to get through. She must get him and bring him in.\n\nShe found her woolen hood, bound her feet and legs in burlap over her overshoes and leggings, put on her heavy coat, took Mother's knitted shawl and threw around her shoulders. She knelt by Mother's bed and prayed for confidence and courage.\n\nOut into the night, out into the trail, she went alone and unafraid. The wind was blowing, but it was behind her. It helped her break the trail. Quietly, peacefully, the time went by, and quietly, peacefully her courage kept her moving forward. She did not know how long—she did not know how far, but of one thing she was certain—Andrew was out there in the snow, and she would never stop until she found him.\n\nFinally she saw what she was looking for, a big object in the snow, the handcart. \"Andrew! Andrew!\" She almost ran to him. She brushed the snow from the handcart, got his blankets and stretched them out on the cart, then she raised him up, brushed the snow from him, and pulled him onto the blankets. 463 She had Andrew now. No power on earth could stop her. She would take him into camp. It was strange, but the wind that helped her break the trail had changed, and was now at her back, pushing her back to camp. On and on she went. It was not all her own strength that was turning the wheels through the heavy snow. Finally, she saw horses and riders in the distance. She heard voices. President Wood and Hugh were coming to meet her. Soon they would both be safe. \"Margaret, don't ever do such a thing again!\" But Margaret did not answer. Andrew was safe, and that was all that mattered.\n\nEe Ke\n\nHE company crossed the river and kept pushing forward, but the snow was deep. The rations grew less and less, until they did not have strength enough to shovel through the drifts. Several days they tried to go on, but it was useless. They made camp in a canyon with protection from the storms, and waited for help from Zion. Margaret spent her time nursing the sick—so many in their own ward needed help and encouragement. One night she came to Mother, overtired after a very hard day. Mother had some hot soup waiting for her. Hugh had killed a doe and he divided it with the aged, and with mothers of small children. Margaret sat down and tried to eat, but the thought of her friends made it impossible. She laid her spoon down by her dish and sat thinking, then burst into tears.\n\n\"I canna eat—I canna eat, Mother. My throat fills up and I canna swallow.\" She laid her head in her arms and began to sob.\n\nAndrew jumped to Margaret's side and called to Mother Mac. Mother took the weeping girl in her arms. The Macs had tried to be cheerful all of the day, but they were weary. Mother's usual smile was gone. She was worried; the last food was in the pot.\n\nAndrew looked about at the serious faces, so unlike the Macs. \"What's the matter with the lights?\" he asked. Mother looked up without answering. Kathleen and Margaret were sitting on Mother's bed.\n\n\"No coal oil,\" Margaret replied.\n\nAndrew asked them to kneel and repeat the Lord's prayer with him.\n\n\"Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed by thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread....\"\n\n\"Whoa—Whoa—Anybody at home?\" A shout in the distance heralding, at last, the hoped-for help from the saints in Zion, was heard. They continued and finished the prayer. Tears were rolling down their faces, tears of gratefulness.\n\n\"Thank you, God,\" Andrew murmured.\n\nMargaret and Andrew rushed to the wagons. The men had removed the wagon tops, so they could get at the food. In their work they knocked off a box of soda crackers. The box broke into pieces when it hit the ground. Margaret stooped down and began to fill her apron with the crackers.\n\n\"Wait a minute, Miss. Things must be divided,\" Andrew's face went white. \"You had your breakfast and your dinner. These You'll get your supper,\" he said shortly. \"Remember, Andrew, the Scotch pay for their tempers,\" Margaret whispered.\n\nThe driver stood up and looked around. \"Not this time he won't. A million apologies, my brother, take the crackers, all of them, and everything else you can reach. They are all yours—all yours.\"\n\nMargaret filled her apron and went running to Mother and Kathleen. Andrew followed. He was weak and trembling.\n\nONE forenoon Margaret searched out Mother Mac in the Shand tent.\n\n\"Mother, try to understand what I am going to tell you, and if you can, see it my way. I'm leaving in the morning with Brother Brown from Tooele. He is taking a number of sick people into Salt Lake City and I'm going along to take care of them.\"\n\n\"You made up your mind in a hurry, didn't you, Margaret?\"\n\n\"Well, Brother Brown was in Great Salt Lake to conference, and when they asked for volunteers to bring provisions out to us, he volunteered. One good turn deserves another. I would like to go.\"\n\n\"I've always had a mind, Margaret, that you would be with me when my baby came,\" Kathleen voiced her keen disappointment.\n\n\"So I would if I could, Kathleen, but you will have Hugh and Mother. My prayers will be with you every day.\"\n\n\"Well, Margaret, if that's the way you want it, I think it's all right. We will miss you, and be sure to take care of yourself in the snow.\"\n\nQUESTING LIGHTS\n\nBut Andrew was not willing to see Margaret go.\n\n\"Now you are loaning Margaret,\" he reminded the women. \"Well, we've done pretty well to keep her this long,\" Mother responded. \"All good things must come to an end sooner or later.\"\n\nNext morning the wagons were ready to take off. Margaret was the last one to be helped into the wagon. The Macs stood nearby with very serious faces. Andrew was drinking water from a tin cup. He had never been able to express his appreciation to Margaret for bringing him in from the trail.\n\nAs she climbed up the wheel with Brother Brown assisting her, Andrew forced himself to call to her, \"Thanks for saving my life.\"\n\nShe turned on top of the wheel. \"Oh, that,\" she nonchalantly offered, \"it was such a little thing, think nothing of it.\"\n\nAndrew gasped, \"My life a little thing, hey? Well, how do you like that?\" He threw the water in the tin cup at her.\n\nMargaret dodged and fell head-first into the wagon among boxes, bedding, and sick saints. Brother Brown pulled the canvas up over the front, spoke to his team, and Margaret started on the last part of her journey to Zion. (To be continued)\n\n\"THIS JOURNEY MAY APPEAR\" Alta L.

(To be continued)  \nNature's Tonic Alice Whitson Norton 669M  \nWorn out before the day has really started,\" Mrs. Walton complained to her neighbor, Mrs. Barnett, when they met at the fence dividing their back yards for the purpose of spreading their freshly washed dish cloths in the sun for drying. As usual they paused for a moment of idle chatter. \"You do look a little pale,\" Mrs. Barnett answered. \"Maybe you need a tonic.\"  \n\"I do need a tonic,\" Mrs. Walton agreed, \"but what sort of tonic to try next is the question. You see,\" she went on, \"I've just about tried them all—vitamins included—and look at me.\"  \nMrs. Barnett, complying with the request, smiled faintly. \"Now you're laughing at me,\" scoffed the neighbor, \"and me in need of medicine.\"  \n\"Not at you, Mrs. Walton,\" returned Mrs. Barnett. \"I was only remembering that I, too, once depended on patent medicines to keep me physically fit—but now—\"  \n\"Know,\" broke in the woman despondently, \"now that you're well and running around to this, that, and the other, you've lost sight of your past ailments.\"  \n\"Maybe so,\" laughed Mrs. Barnett, \"for running here, there, and everywhere is just a part of the day's work for me now. But there was a time when I got out of bed each morning, wondering how I could get through the day ahead. But, finally, a good friend pointed out the wonders of nature's tonic to me, and I've been enjoying my existence on this earth ever since.\"  \n\"Nature's tonic!\" exclaimed Mrs. Walton. \"I dare say I've used a thousand bottles of those pills but they never helped me a bit.\"  \n\"I'm not talking about bottled tonics,\" Mrs. Barnett chuckled, \"but unbottled and free for the asking.\"  \nMrs. Walton moved a bit closer to her neighbor. \"Just what are you talking about, Mrs. Barnett?\" she asked solemnly. \"Nobody could look at you and suspect you ever felt bad in your entire life.\"  \n\"You should have seen me before I began taking nature's tonic,\" returned the cheery creature, \"mouth down at the corners, drab-colored dresses, mopping, dusting, cooking the day through and making my body miserable about me.\"  \n\"But the tonic that wrought the change,\" interrupted Mrs. Walton, \"tell me about that. Where did you buy it?\"  \n\"You don't buy it,\" laughed Mrs. Barnett. \"You earn it, but once you've tasted the benefit you never want to do without it any more.\"  \n\"You said a friend pointed it out to you,\" murmured Mrs. Walton. \"Mind telling me how it happened?\"  \n\"Sure,\" replied Mrs. Barnett, \"I can tell you how it happened, but it still embarrasses me.\"  \nMrs. Walton spread the last NATURE'S TONIC white cloth on the fence and again faced her neighbor. \"Strange to say,\" chuckled Mrs. Barnett, \"I was doing the same thing when nature's tonic was pointed out to me as we are doing now, except with another neighbor in another section of this town. And, like you now, I was at that time complaining of my ailments, when suddenly the sunny creature on the other side of the fence burst out laughing.\"  \n\"What you need to do,\" she said, \"is to clear your medicine cabinet of every patent medicine bottle it contains; contribute those drab garments you wear to the needy, and start looking for joy and things to laugh over.\"  \n\"I hope you slapped her face,\" Mrs. Walton exclaimed. \"The idea of a friend talking like that!\"  \n\"Well,\" laughed Mrs. Barnett, \"I did at the moment feel like doing that very thing, but my friend vanished so quickly after the outburst I missed the opportunity, and later on I found myself thinking—maybe she was right. All the patent medicine I had taken made no improvement in my feelings. I was a stick-at-home. My clothes were drab, chosen purposely because they didn't show soil as much as light ones. I looked like my clothes. The house, though shining with cleanliness, provided a dull atmosphere for my family.  \nAll day I thought about the matter and remembered with a sudden shock I was living under a weight of constant worry; worry lest some of the children would leave mud tracks on the floor, slam 467 a door, or stage a pillow fight. Worried lest the rent on the house should not be promptly met; the furniture bills not promptly paid; unexpected company might drop in—crossing bridges and climbing hills I never came to.  \nBy late afternoon I was thoroughly convinced my neighbor was right. What I needed was laughter and happiness that I had so long denied myself.\"  \n\"So you changed your mode of living?\" Mrs. Walton returned with a long glance at her neighbor's bright, flowered dress. \"Yes,\" Mrs. Barnett answered, \"I began by clearing the cabinet—of patent medicine bottles, and giving away my drab garments. Then I looked the house over; removed the chairs from their set spaces; raised the shades and flooded the place with sunshine and started living by a new pattern.\"  \nWhether I felt like singing or not,\" she continued, \"I sang as I cooked breakfast, and when the meal was ready for serving, I insisted the family be at the table to eat, and no disagreeable subjects were allowed for discussion.  \nAt first the members of my family cast surprising glances upon me, but as time passed and my constant grumbling changed into pleasant conversation, I found the older members of my household kissing me goodbye when they left for work, and greeting me with affection when they returned.  \nI really was so busy and so happy learning to live as God created me to live that I lost sight of my ills, and one day to my intense delight, I discovered I was physically well and had learned to laugh; and life with all its problems was moving on a new scale of happiness for me and mine.  \nWhen I grew tired physically,\" Mrs. Barnett commented, \"I dropped whatever I was doing and tumbled down on my very best bed to rest for a full fifteen minutes.\n\nAt the end of that period I'd figure out short cuts in housework—good, wholesome meals that could be provided with less physical strength than I had heretofore used, and once I got things systematized, I discovered I really had a bit of extra time on my hands, so I began to attend Relief Society and take part in other Church and community activities. \"Today I do believe, due to nature's tonic alone, I am the healthiest, happiest person in the whole, wide world. And there,\" she said, laughing as the sound of a telephone bell vibrated through the glorious morning air, \"is Mrs. Clarke reminding me to lead the singing this afternoon. Bye-bye.\" With that she went racing across the yard and vanished through the door of the house that had, under the influence of nature's tonic, become a home. \"Well,\" mused Mrs. Walton, with a sudden straightening of her sagging shoulders, \"I'm not sure nature's tonic can do as much for me as it did for her, but it won't do me any harm to try her remedy.\" And now, may I add, at the end of a twelve months' trial, it's hard to tell which of the two women wears the brightest house dresses, or laughs the heartiest when they meet for a morning chat over the back fence. \n\nSoups—Foreign and Domestic Sara Mills\nA NY woman who has a particle of pride in her cooking should have a specialty which she serves at every opportunity. I once knew a fair, sweet-tempered woman whose specialty was cream puffs with caramel sauce. Her friends, including me, would go many unnecessary miles merely hoping that cream puffs would be waiting. I'm as fond of cream puffs as the next one, but somehow I never make them. I wait until they are given me. Soup, as I may have hinted before, is my specialty. The reason for this I have never probed. The recipes given here I have collected and developed through many years. \n\nOnion soup, French of course, heads the list, perhaps because it is the first good soup I ever learned to make. The recipe serves four.\n\nFrench Onion Soup\n1 lb. Lean beef chopped\nwater to make 1½ quarts of stock\n4 red onions, sliced\n1 tbsp. Butter\n2 slices toast, grated Parmesan cheese or Swiss cheese to cover toast\nsalt and pepper\n\nBrown one half of the chopped lean beef in sizzling fat. Meanwhile, soak the other half of the lean meat in cold water for one half hour. Combine the meats, add salt and pepper, and simmer for about six hours. Slice the onions crosswise and fry gently in butter until they are a delicate golden brown. Add the onions to the soup stock and boil for 45 minutes. Now pour the soup into a large oven-proof bowl or casserole. Cover the slices of toast (or croutons, if you prefer) generously with the grated Parmesan or Swiss cheese, slide them gently onto the soup, and bake the soup in the oven for ten minutes. Do this just before serving.\n\nIt is a soup beloved by men and good enough for the most special occasion. Another palate-tickling onion soup is made from chicken stock. Brown the onions (one to a person), as in the previous recipe, then add a tablespoon of flour and mix well. Add the chicken stock, and cook as before. Don't forget the toast and cheese. For a change, use thick slices of toasted French bread.\n\nLentil Soup\nThis is another importation, hearty and vitamin-filled, that can be used as a one-dish luncheon or dinner, an after-the-game supper, or a Sunday night supper when there is a crowd and no one wants to waste time in the kitchen. Serve it with brown bread and butter. Add a green salad and apple pie, and you have a feast.\n\nThe dish serves ten.\n1 lb. lentils, soaked in water overnight\n1 large onion\n2 carrots, diced\n2 outer stalks of celery, diced\n2 tbsp. butter\n4 slices bacon, diced\n2 tbsp. flour\n4 cans consomme\n2 quarts water\n1 ham bone\n2-3 medium-sized potatoes\n10 boiled, sliced frankfurters\na few drops Worcestershire sauce\nsalt and pepper\nlemon slices for serving\nchopped parsley\n\nSoak the lentils in water overnight. About two hours before serving-time, dice the vegetables and simmer them in the bacon fat and butter, along with the diced bacon. Do this in a large soup kettle. Next add the lentils and the 2 tablespoons flour. Stir well, and add the consomme, water, and ham bone. Cover and cook slowly for an hour. Next, add the diced potatoes and cook for one half hour. Remove the ham bone, cut the lean ham in pieces, and return to the soup, along with the frankfurters, the drops of sauce, and the chopped parsley. Let simmer for a few minutes before serving.\n\nPlace a thin slice of lemon on top of each serving. Taste, and add the necessary salt and pepper.\n\nCream of Spinach Soup\n2 4 cups chopped spinach\n1 cup finely chopped onion\n1 cup finely diced carrot\n3 cups milk\nsalt and pepper\ntsp. mace\n1 cup whipped cream\nhandful of spinach heart leaves\n\nPlace the spinach, onions, and carrots in the top of a double boiler, along with 1 cup of milk. Cook covered until the vegetables are tender, then press them through a sieve. Add the 3 remaining cups of milk, salt, pepper, and mace. Simmer ten to fifteen minutes, then fold in the whipped cream. Garnish the servings with the spinach heart leaves, chopped.\n\nServes six to eight persons.\n\nOne last word on soup making: use your leftovers, leftover bones—you pay plenty for them—leftover vegetables, left-over vegetable juices. Cook the bones with any leftover meat in water, salt and pepper, and a handful of vegetables—peas, green beans, carrots, celery, parsley, green squash, etc., with a few herbs. Strain the stock, reheat it with tomato juice, and serve it with crackers or croutons. Sometimes steal a little piece of lean meat from your pot roast or stew and simmer it for several hours with your leftovers. At our house we call it supper broth, and the children love it."

    "content": "Principles and Laws Governing Good Singing Florence J. Madsen\nMember, Relief Society General Board\n\nHow wonderful is the human voice! It is indeed the organ of the soul. The intellect of man sits enthroned, visibly, on his forehead and in his eye, and the heart of man is written on his countenance, but the soul reveals itself in the voice only—Longfellow\n\nThis is but one of the many recorded statements that have been made by poets, philosophers, and musicians during past centuries on the wonders of the human voice. This high estimate of the voice is just as much a reality today as it was then. This is a golden age of musical possibilities. Most schools and churches regard vocal study and performance as indispensable to the perpetuation and advancement of educational ideals and moral growth. Our Church has always encouraged and stressed the development of musical talents.\n\nCourses have been adopted, singing groups have been organized, and teachers and leaders have been appointed to advance musical culture commensurate with Church ideals and interests. This has led to specialized activity in the art of singing. Vocal art includes several very important factors which, in turn, are made up of many fundamental details. In order to effect further advancement in our singing organizations it becomes necessary to study and emphasize these. Since tone quality is the basic element of beautiful singing, this detail should be given first consideration. The vowel is the source of tone. If it is perfect the tone will be likewise. This fact makes it fundamentally necessary to study the vowel, how to speak and sing it properly. Vowels must be sung without restraint or interference of any kind. To do this the following rules should be observed while singing: a. Open the mouth almost to a yawn position. B. Originate all vowels in the same place, the back of the mouth—the pharynx. C. Sustain all vowels from beginning to end with the same volume unless otherwise indicated. D. Sing the vowels in the easy range of the voice with \"M\" as the prefix and sustain each one eight counts, four gradually louder (crescendo); four gradually softer (decrescendo or diminuendo). Sing in slow tempo. Then increase to sixteen counts and divide in the same proportion. Avoid all throat restriction and tension of tongue and jaw in all singing. E. To sing properly the chest and nbs must be kept high and expanded, while the abdominal muscles are lifted and contracted. This type of breathing should be practiced until it becomes a habit. This is also essential to good speaking.\n\n[Note: The short articles on music which appear in the Magazine may form the basis for the discussion in the choristers' and organists' department at union meeting.]\n\nPage 470\n\nNotes On the Authors of the Lessons\nThis year an author new to Relief Society members appears as a writer of one of the lesson series.

Colton Preview of Lessons for 1948-49 This preview of the second year's course in the series entitled \"The Life and Ministry of the Savior\" introduces the eight lessons for 1948-49. The textbook to be followed again this year is Jesus the Christ, by Elder James E. Talmage. Each of the first eight lessons of the series for 1947-48 covered two chapters of the text. This year only one chapter of the text will be treated in each lesson, as it is felt that each chapter provides sufficient material to occupy the full theology class period. Material for lesson enrichment will be found in the references at the end of each chapter. Class leaders are advised to guide the discussion in the theology classes so that extraneous or controversial subjects do not enter into it, and only outlined subject matter is considered. The main objective of the course is to give the women of the Church opportunity to study and discuss events in the life of the Savior and his teachings, thereby strengthening their faith and increasing their testimonies. For more than nineteen centuries righteous people have found consolation and hope in such study, and it is hoped that each course in this series will bring increased joy and understanding to Relief Society members.\n\nThe titles of the eight lessons for this year's course are the names of chapters 17 to 24, inclusive, of the textbook Jesus the Christ. The titles and objectives of the lessons follow:\n\nLesson 9. \"The Sermon on the Mount\" Objective: To create a deep appreciation of the Savior and his gospel by a study of the masterful \"Sermon on the Mount.\"\n\nLesson 10. \"As One Having Authority\" Objective: To offer proof that Jesus the Lord possessed the fulness of divine power and authority.\n\nLesson 11. \"He Spake Many Things Unto Them in Parables\" Objective: To create a desire to study and understand the gospel of the kingdom.\n\nLesson 12. \"Peace, Be Still\" Objective: To strengthen faith in the Lord Jesus Christ through the recognition of his power over the forces of nature, men, and even demons.\n\nLesson 13. \"The Apostolic Mission, and Events Related Thereto\" Objective: To show how those who put their trust in the Lord gain spiritual power and knowledge.\n\nLesson 14. \"A Period of Darkening Opposition\" Objective: To acquaint class members with the events of the Savior's life during the time he was preparing the apostles for their final great responsibilities.\n\nLesson 15.\n\n\"The Transfiguration\" Objective: To become acquainted with one of the outstanding events of the Savior's earthly ministry. Lesson 16. \"From Sunshine to Shadow\" Objective: To follow the Savior in his final preparation for the supreme sacrifice, and to show how he prepared his apostles for their great missions. Textbooks Talmage, James E.: Jesus the Christ, Deseret Book Company, $2.50. Lesson 9 THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT Elder Don B. Colton (Reference: Jesus the Christ, Chapter 17 by Elder James E. Talmage) For Tuesday, October 5, 1948 Objective: To create a deep appreciation of the Savior and his gospel by a study of the masterful \"Sermon on the Mount.\" Note: All quotations which are not followed by references are taken from the text Jesus the Christ. THIS great discourse was delivered by the Savior about the time of the calling and ordination of the Twelve, and portions of the address were delivered primarily to them. The sermon has been called the Constitution of Christianity. It does contain many of the fundamental principles. It is a masterpiece of literature. The word pictures are very impressive. Examples: ... A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid (Matt. 5:14). Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? (Matt. 7:16). Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask for bread, will he give him a stone? (Matt. 7:9). For nearly two thousand years, righteous people everywhere have found great consolation in what has come to be known as the \"Beatitudes.\" The assurance that conditions hereafter will be better, has sustained and comforted the less fortunate in every nation. Clearly the blessings and happiness promised are not all to be realized in their fulness in this life. The Beatitudes are directed to the duties of mortal life as a preparation for a greater existence yet future.\" The question, \"How can I be happy?\" is uppermost in the minds of most people. What we are determines, largely, our happiness in life. The blessings enumerated by Jesus give us the key: It is being merciful, pure in heart, loving even our enemies; these and others he named as necessary to the \"peace which passeth all understanding.\" It should always be noted that the teaching of the Savior was an invitation to approach his standard as nearly as possible and, with satisfaction, enjoy his message. His intercession for us, individually, is grounded upon merit and, therefore, justice must ultimately prevail. Firm faith in this, and in the final triumph of right, is very comforting. An interesting discussion of the difference between pleasure and happiness is found on page 247 of the text, Jesus the Christ. The Law Superseded by the Gospel - He had come, not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it and to establish that which the Prophets had foretold would come. The explanation of this as delivered to the Nephites is: And it came to pass that when Jesus had said these words he perceived that there I say unto you that the law is fulfilled that was given unto Moses. Behold, I am he that gave the law, and I am he who covenanted with therefore, the law in me is fulfilled, for do not destroy the prophets, for as many as have not been fulfilled in me, verily I have come to fulfill them. The gospel did not destroy the Mosaic law; it supplanted that law by a higher and more perfect one. The law provided specific penalties for an evil deed while the gospel forbade even the evil thoughts and passions which led to the bad deed. A good illustration is the sin against the moral laws. Jesus said this sin began with the lustful look and sometimes with evil thoughts. He struck at the very root of evil. We should avoid evil thinking. The thought is often father to the act, Is pronouncement against divorce was very strong. It may be well for class leaders to read at this point Matthew 19:4-9. God's law contemplates that man and wife shall not be divorced. That was the law in the beginning, although divorce has been permitted, or, as the Savior said, \"suffered,\" at times for particular reasons. Retaliation had been permitted under the Mosaic law. \"Thus an eye was demanded for the loss of an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a life.\" It was the law in those days that if a Roman demanded that a Jew go with him a mile to carry a burden or for other purposes the Jew must so. Jesus urged that one should go the second mile. He probably did not mean that the apostles should be abjectly subservient work in the ministry more efficient. Let there be enhanced. It was an entirely new doctrine the Lord taught: Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you (Matt. 5:44). This would train them to be longsuffering and tolerant as our Father in heaven. He causes the rain to fall and the sun to shine on the just and the unjust. Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect (Matt. 5:48). Sincerity of Purpose The Master enjoined upon his followers sincerity and denounced hypocrisy. He was emphatic as regards the giving of alms so that it might be seen of men. The saying of prayers to be heard of men was also severely condemned. Then followed the giving of a model prayer. The Lord's Prayer, as it is called, is so all inclusive and yet so easily understood and soul-inspiring that it should be memorized. (See Matthew 6:9-13.) For the first time permission was given to address Elohim as \"Our Father.\" The common brotherhood of man and our relationship to Christ, our Elder Brother, are clearly declared. One stands in wonder and awe at the nearness to the infinite Deity. We get a glimpse of the reason for God's great love. Our Father! What meaningful words! Read, or sing, that marvelous hymn, \"O My Father.\" (Read Jesus the Christ, pages 238-242.) Another new doctrine: For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses (Matt. 6:14-15). Treasures of Earth and of Heaven It is comforting to many to read the Lord's estimate of true wealth. He especially contrasts enduring riches of eternity with the passing wealth of this world. A life well spent in doing good deeds is far more desirable than one spent in amassing and hoarding gold or silver. How oft we hear his statement, \"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also\" (Matt. 6:21). When he turned to a discussion of the inner self, the Master showed his keen discernment of the forces of life. \"The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thy eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light\" (Matt. 6:22).\n\nOf course, he was speaking of the natural or mortal eye. It receives the light of the sun and gives light unto the body. Likewise, if the spiritual eye is undimmed by sin, one can see the pathway to God. Job said, \"For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes\" (Job 11:4). It is clear that if we are to know God we must serve him and keep his commandments. Especially with the apostles there was to be no middle pathway. Truly Jesus was the Master Teacher. How well he led his listeners from the known to the unknown! He talked of how well the Father cares even for the fowls of the air, that faith might be increased in the hearts of those who heard him. If God fed the birds, and arrayed the lilies of the field better than Solomon was arrayed, how much more would he watch over those whom he had called to be messengers of life and salvation.\n\nHypocrisy Further Condemned\n\nThe followers of Jesus are admonished not to judge others. \"It is high time to leave judgment with the Lord. The world, our life eternal with God.\" Is Contained in Matthew 5:17-20 is in heaven will enter into the kingdom of heaven, hearing and doing.\n\nJesus knew that some who listened to him delivered his great address and forget it all on earth ever taught us as did Jesus. Questions and Suggestions for Discussion\n\n1. Read the Beatitudes, in them,\n2. State some of the instructions which Jesus gave to his chosen Twelve,\n3. What contrasts are there between the Gospel of Christ?\n4. Repeat the golden rule. Show how faith and love are necessary to live it,\n\nPEACEMAKERS\n\nThe days of the Savior. Key to it is far better than securing peace of mind.\n\nAppiness by Securing Peace of Mind \n\nAssisting Searchers' Messages—Our Savior Speaks Elder H. Wayne Driggs Preview of Lessons for 1948-49 THE Visiting Teachers' Messages for 1948-49 will tie in with our theology lessons: \"The Life and Ministry of the Savior.\" The messages will be admonitions and other significant statements of Christ which are timely today. As far as possible, the messages will be suited to the particular month in which they are to be presented. The main title of the series will be: \"Our Savior Speaks.\"\n\nThe subtitles for the various months will be as follows:\n\nLesson 1. \"Ye shall do the works which ye see me do.\" Objective: To present these words in the homes visited as \"'the grand key words of the Society\" and to point out that the objective of Relief Society has never changed.\n\nLesson 2. \"Where are the nine?\" (Luke 17:17) Objective: To warn against the sin of ingratitude.\n\nLesson 3. \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me\" (Matt. 25:40). Objective: To reaffirm what constitutes the true spirit of giving.\n\nLesson 4. \"In the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer\" (John 16:33). Objective: To give encouragement to face the coming year courageously.\n\nLesson 5. \"Judge not that ye be not judged\" (Matt. 7:1).. Objective: To point out that it is not our place to pass judgment on another.\n\nLesson 6. \"Ye cannot serve God and Mammon\" (Matt. 6:24). Objective: To emphasize that the allurements of the world do not provide lasting happiness.\n\nLesson 7. \"I will not leave you comfortless\" (John 14:18). Objective: To point out that we are not left comfortless because of our sure knowledge, through Christ's teachings and the Holy Ghost, of the resurrection.\n\nLesson 8. \"Ye are the light of the world\" (Matt. 5:14). Objective: To emphasize that where much is given much is expected.\n\nLesson 9. \"Ye shall do the work which ye see me do.\" Elder H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, October 5, 1948\n\nObjective: To present these words in the homes visited as the \"grand key words\" of Relief Society and to point out that the objective has never changed.\n\nThe Savior in his earthly ministry ever strove to link the spiritual with the temporal. He taught that life on earth had its counterpart in heaven, that, in fact, a \"heaven on earth\" was the nearest example we could have of the joys in the perfect life beyond. It was through this teaching that he impressed his followers with the need of belief on him and the works that he did. At the ninth meeting of Relief Society, the Prophet Joseph Smith declared, \"Said Jesus, 'Ye shall do the work which ye see me do.' These are the grand key words for the Society to act upon.\" From that day, in 1842, to the present time, those grand key words have served to guide the society along its path and motivate Relief Society members to perform the work done by the Master.\n\nWhen we think of the work done by the Savior, we are apt to remember his miracles, but it is significant that our works need not of necessity be these epic-making events. The blind need not be restored to sight, the deaf to hear, nor even the dead to walk again. How then may we do the works which he did? The answer is to be found in reading, and making our own, a very few words about Jesus which nevertheless speak volumes: \"who went about doing good\" (Acts 10:38). By the exercise of great faith, as Relief Society members, and more particularly as visiting teachers, we can actually aid the blind to see; we also can open the eyes of those who are spiritually dim-sighted; we can by faith still an actual tempest, and we also can calm the tempest in some troubled soul. One is no greater miracle than the other.\n\nThe acts of Jesus were acts of understanding and love. These we can perform. These are as much needed today as they ever were. We can \"go about doing good.\"\n\n\"Ye shall do the work which ye see me do.\" Literature of the Latter-day Saints\n\nLiterature of the Gospel Restoration Elder Howard R. Driggs Preview of Lessons for 1948-49\n\nLiterature, in its broadest sense applies to all that is written. Thus we may speak of the literature of mathematics, of science, of philosophy, of commerce, of advertising, or of any other field of study or activity. In a more restrictive sense, however, the term literature means that body of writings characterized by artistry of expression, of creative skill in portraying life, impressing truth, as in poetry, drama, fiction, oratory, essays, or sermons. A synonymous term suggestive of this product of literary art is belle-lettres.\n\nThis course on \"Literature of the Latter-day Saints\" —a pioneering venture—obviously cannot be spread over the whole field; nor can it be held within the narrow one. What is planned is a series of studies that will deal with such literature of varied types as portrays truthfully the History, the character, the ideals of our people.\n\nWhatever can be found that rings true to the highest and best in the epic rise of our Church may be presented for appreciation and uplift.\nNaturally, in a two-year course, with eight lessons for each year, only the highlights of the alluring theme can be given attention. Yet from these selective lessons, carefully prepared by class leaders and members, should come a rich fruitage. Certainly these results from the work may be confidently expected:\nFirst, help in clarifying the gospel as taught and lived by Latter-day Saints.\nSecond, an improved sense of selection, or skill to find true literature.\nThird, new joy in discovery and enrichment from the best of our literature.\nWith a stream of materials, books and articles, pouring off the press, both within and without the Church, we need such guidance. Earnest, co-operative study will help to meet this basic need. Such training will save time and money and, better still, will give to those who take it a new and vitalized view of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nPeople live on through their earthly literature. Their hopes, ideals, achievements, written with artistry, continue to vibrate so long as the record endures and is read with understanding, with appreciation. Through the radiant influence of good books mankind may keep rising to higher levels, may gain guidance to follow ever the path of righteousness.\nThink here of the scriptures. Have not the \"chosen people\" continued to live because of the \"Old Testament\"? What would we know of the creation, the patriarchs and the prophets—the epic story of the children of Israel—had this \"Book of Books\" not been created and preserved?\nHow much likewise would be known of our Savior had not Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John written the precious gospels? Or what would be known of the rise of the early Christian Church if Luke had not made vibrant record of it through \"The Acts of the Apostles\"; had not Paul and the other stalwarts who carried forward the divine work of the Master not written their epistles, and John not bequeathed to the world \"The Revelation\"? Truly our indebtedness to these holy men who through inspiration and devotion gave us these sacred scriptures is great and lasting.\nLatter-day Saints have added reason for gratitude. Through sacrificial efforts of other men of God our people have an enriched heritage of sacred literature. Our Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price add treasures of scriptural knowledge and dramatic stories to help vitalize the gospel, to give it greater clarity, and to teach people how more surely to live it. These volumes, together with the Bible, make the basic, the standard literature of our religion.\nDependable history of our Church and of its leaders and its members—constitutes another body of literature—ever being enriched and expanding as the great work progresses. LESSON DEPARTMENT Significant incidents from this developing epic, events of dramatic cast and revealing import, truthfully, inspiringly written, help bring out the inner meaning of the gospel in action. Stories of the men and women who have lived it help to humanize the messages of the Savior as applied to today. Words of truth and light from leaders and others who feel and know the gospel, help to interpret and impress it. Out of all this wealth of materials, too, may come songs and lyrics that live—stories and drama of stirring true-to-life cast, orations and sermons that impress truth. Our part is to discover these gems of expression, these life-giving thoughts, these dramatic events, and to appreciate them. To that end this series of what we hope may be practical and inspirational lessons is planned. For the first year the work will be on what may be called \"Literature of the Gospel Restoration.\" A brief outline suggestive of the study centers of this part of the course follows:\n1. Literature of the Beginnings Background study of family and boyhood of Joseph Smith in source writings—and study from literary viewpoint of Joseph's own story of the restoration.\n2. Highlights of the Book of Mormon Epic Study of some of the dramatic events portrayed in this new \"Book of Books\"—this from the standpoint of effective storytelling.\n3. Gospel Messages from the Book of Mormon Study of distinctive contributions of religious import and of literary value in the Book of Mormon.\n4. Words of Light and Truth From the Prophet Study of choice selections from the words of the Prophet Joseph Smith.\n5. Earlier Evangelistic Literature Study of selected excerpts from diaries, autobiographies, and other writings by loyal ones who helped in establishing the Church through testing years.\n6. Lyric Expression of the Restoration Study of gospel songs and other poetic expression vibrant with the message of the new dispensation.\n7. Literary Sidelights of the Founding Years Study of selections from this expository literature written to clarify and impress basic principles of the restored gospel in action.\n8. Literature of the Prophet's Closing Years Study of distinctive and dependable literature portraying soul-testing, dramatic incidents that mark the rise of the Church under the inspired leadership of the Prophet Joseph Smith.\nThis spread of inviting work may we again impress represents a pioneering venture into a rich realm. It is entered into humbly with one thought, that of doing good. Our hope is not to cover the wide field with adequacy; rather do we trust that it may be opened alluringly, that new interest will be wakened, enjoyment and enrichment come to those who pioneer with us.\nFurther, this first year's work on \"Literature of the Gospel Restoration\" should lay a good foundation for the second year's course which is to be centered round the general theme, \"Literature of the Expanding Pioneer Period.\"\n\nLesson 1—Literature of the Beginnings Elder Howard R. Driggs For Tuesday, October 19, 1948\nO P letters often give living glimpses of the past. Thoughts, feelings, home news, comments on passing events, informally written to friends and loved ones, are revealing of the character of the writer as well as of the days in which he or she lived. Sometimes such letters, in parts, rise to literary excellence; always they are source material of more or less help to historians and authors.\nFortunately for our present purpose, two such old letters have been preserved since the days when Washington was President of our country. They both were written by a stalwart American, Asael Smith, paternal grandfather of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and great-great-grandfather of George Albert Smith, now President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nThis grandsire, born in 1744, twelve years after the \"Father of our Country\" came into the world, had lived through the stirring years of the French and Indian War, the Revolutionary War, in which he took part as a soldier of the American army, and on through the founding of our Nation to the year 1830, when our Church was organized.\nThe first of these letters, written to a friend, Jacob Town, reveals Asael Smith as one of the solid New England type, God-fearing, patriotic, of loyal friendship, with independent spirit, and a sense of humor.\n\nAfter acknowledging with appreciation a letter from his friend, telling with gratitude of the well-being of his family, and giving word of the building of a new home, Asael writes of a \"noisy\" political party just defeated in its hopes to seize power. Then he comments: For my part, I am so willing to trust the government of the world in the hands of the Supreme Ruler of Universal Nature, that I do not, at present, wish to try to wrest it out of His hands.... He has conducted us through a glorious Revolution and has brought us into the promised land of peace and liberty; and I believe that He is about to bring all the world in the same beatitude in His own time and way. Then comes this touch of pleasantry: Give my best regards to your parents and tell them I have taken up with the eleventh commandment, that the negro taught to the minister, which was thus: The minister asked the negro how many commandments there were and his answer was \"eleven, sir.\" \"Aye,\" replied the other. \"What is the eleventh? That is one I have never heard of.\" \"The eleventh commandment, sir, is mind your own business.\" So I choose to do. Write to me as often and as large as you can and oblige your friend and well-wisher. (signed) Asael Smith\n\nThe second letter, written for his family, and to be read after his death, contains such gems of religious thought as the following: The soul is immortal; you have to deal with an infinite Majesty. Do all to God in a serious manner; when you think of Him, speak of Him, pray of Him, or in any way make your addresses to His great Majesty, be in good carest. Trifle not with His name nor with His attributes, nor call Him to witness to anything but is absolute truth. If you find that you stand in need of a Savior, Christ saith: \"Look unto me.\"\n\nOther gems of practical wisdom are in these lines from the letter: Above everything avoid a melancholy disposition, that is a humor that admits of any temptation and is capable of any impression and distemper. Any honest calling will honor you, if you honor that. Persevere in the way of well-doing and you may hope for success.\n\nThe letter closes with this paragraph: And all, and myself... And wish to leave to you everything I have in this world but oblivion; but leaving my virtues, if ever I had any, to revive and live in you (B.H., Comprehensive History of the Church, I, pp. 7, 8, 9, 10, 12). Surely the virtues of this grandsire have lived on in his posterity and have been amplified for the everlasting good of mankind.\n\nAnother type of literature represented by the History of Joseph Smith, by His Mother, Lucy Mack Smith, brings us close to the Prophet's boyhood, and gives the story of his visions and soul-testing struggles through the earlier years of the restoration. All this is portrayed in its relation to loyal family life which characterized the Smith home. It is a story out of a loving, heroic mother heart.\n\nIn straightforward narrative, with 483 richness of incidents such as women more than men treasure, the life of her son Joseph is portrayed. Naturally the background of ancestry, of the struggles to make a livelihood in what was frontier Vermont and tugged western New York are given attention. One feels, too, the devout faith in God from the first through the pages of the little volume. At times, too, the narration attains qualities of story-telling art.\n\nIn chapter fifteen, for illustration, where heroic efforts are made with mother love and faith to save her son Joseph from a dangerous infection, the little drama is stirringly told. Doctors had decided the boy's leg must be amputated, but the mother insisted that one more trial be made to save it. This is the mother's story: The principal Surgeon... ordered cords to be brought to bind Joseph fast to a bedstead; but to this Joseph objected. The doctor, however, insisted that he must be confined, upon which Joseph said very decidedly, \"No, doctor, I will not be bound, for I can bear the operation much better if I have my liberty!\" \"Then,\" said Dr. Stone, \"will you drink some brandy?\" \"No,\" said Joseph, \"not one drop!\" \"Will you take some wine?\" rejoined the doctor. \"You must take something, ation to which you must be subjected.\" \" exclaimed Joseph, \"I will not touch one particle of liquor, neither will I be tied down; but I will tell you what I will do—I will have my father sit on the bed and hold me in his arms, and then I will do whatever is necessary in order to have the bone taken out.\"\n\nLooking at me, he said, \"Mother, I want you to leave the room, for I know you cannot bear to see me suffer so; father can stand it, but you have carried me so much, and watched over me so long, you are almost worn out.\" Then looking up into my face, his eyes swimming in tears, he continued, \"Now Mother, promise me that you will not stay, will you! The Lord will help me, and I shall get through with it.\"\n\nAnother home drama of heart-touching quality is portrayed with like skill in chapter nineteen. Here the death of Alvin Smith, eldest brother of Joseph, is related. Again the tender mother love, the loyalty of the family, more closely drawn together through the persecutions heaped on them for the sake of devotion to the truth, are revealed.\n\nThis faithful brother's counsel to all of them, and especially to his brother Joseph, is most impressive: \"I am now going to die, the distress which I suffer, and the feelings that I have tell me my time is very short. I want you to be a good boy, and do everything that lies in your power to obtain the Record. Be faithful in receiving instruction, and in keeping every commandment that is given you. Your brother Alvin must leave you; but remember the example which he has set for you; and set the same example for the children that are younger than yourself, and always be kind to father and mother.\"\n\nHow faithfully this beloved brother's counsel was followed is impressively revealed in the life story of the Prophet Joseph. Happily we have that story in his own straightforward words. With distinctive clarity of style and convincing detail—for all whose hearts and minds are open to accept spiritual truth—the autobiographical sketch is written. Yet, whether accepted or not accepted, it has the qualities of a classic—it will be read and re-read down the ages.\n\nWhat gives to this life-story such classic qualities? Its central message that God lives.\n\nThis the boy expressed with simple, trenchant words: I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true; and while they were persecuting me.... I was led to say in my heart: Why persecute me for telling the truth? I have actually seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation.: Here is a courageous statement that will ever stand high in religious literature of the world. It is a burning testimony of truth out of the soul of a youth who had been given a divine work to do. With his characteristic straightforward style, Joseph Smith relates the rest of the story of the gospel restoration as he lived it. It is a simple, direct, natural unfolding of a stirring sequence of events. From a literary viewpoint, like other effective narration, it moves forward with clarity of sentences and orderly paragraphs. Such writings may be compared to a chain made up of \"story links.\" Observe, for illustration, this construction of \"Joseph Smith's Own Story.\" After a brief paragraph on his birth in old Vermont, and of the new home in western New York, this chain of events is given: Religious Conflict; A Boy's Problem; Biblical Wisdom; First Prayer; Divine Answer; Derision and Ostracism; Heroic Testimony of the Truth; Lonely, Wayward Years; \"An Angel from on High\"; A Precious Record Revealed; Further Test and Training; Treasures Delivered; Struggles Against Evil-minded Men; Record with God's Help Translated; Publishing of Sacred Scripture; Organization of Church. Apart from the divine import of this stirring epic which has taken its everlasting place in religious literature, there are basic characteristics that give it classic quality. First, it rings of sincerity; second, it has clarity and the charm of simple directness; third, it is portrayed with details that add vividness and— for those of open, spiritual mind and heart—truth. Great literature is lived before it is written. 'This means that what it portrays must be intrinsically a throbbing part of the author who brings it forth. Certainly Joseph Smith lived in reality the story of the gospel restoration. He lived the inner spirit and divine meaning of the Book of Mormon, and other great literature which, under inspiration of God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ, he gave to the hungering world. Ours is a precious privilege to come, through these books and the other literature bequeathed to us by this Prophet of these latter days, into close and uplifting relationship with his inspired and continuing life.\n\nStudies and Activities Note: This lesson on Literature of the Beginnings—it should be kept clearly in mind by teachers and class members—is not to be made merely a study of history, though historical matters naturally will play a part in the study. The central purpose of the lesson and of all the other lessons of the course will be best served by giving major attention to the literary aspect of what is studied.\n\nFirst, in dealing with old letters—it may be well to have the second letter of Asael Smith read for the helpful messages it carries—and a brief discussion of what well-written letters may mean in the preserving of the past—and in their help for history and writers of literature. Second, it will be well also to have some member of the class read aloud the story told in chapter fifteen (History of Joseph Smith By His Mother Lucy Mack Smith), of the Saving of the Boy Joseph—as an example of story-telling art. What qualities make it an effective story? Third, it is urged that the missionary pamphlet, Joseph Smith Tells His Own Story, be obtained by the teacher and the members of the class, so far as this is practicable. With it in hand, the study of the story, not alone for the message it contains—but also—and with emphasis—for appreciation of its literary qualities, can be more interestingly made.\n\nFourth, teachers and class members naturally will be impelled to search out other— firsthand literature which helps bring out vividly the days of the beginning when Joseph Smith as a youth received his divine message from the Father and the Son—and the visitations of the Angel Moroni. Whatever is appropriate to help enrich and vitalize this study should of course be contributed—but with this caution: Do not permit the lesson to go too far afield. Keep it true to its central purpose—make it a study of literature that truly portrays the story, the ideals, the fundamental principles of the gospel.\n\nReferences Documentary History of the Church, Vol. 1.

For women in families with a limited income this ability to make full use of every piece of clothing can be as helpful to the family budget as actually earning extra money. As a general rule an article of clothing is not made over into something else until it is no longer useful in its original form. One must learn to decide whether or not the article is more valuable as it is or as it may be converted. Make-overs cover an almost unlimited field, but in most cases their use is employed when a garment is to be worn by another person. This is not always the case, however, since one can re-use her own clothes by ingenious planning. A coat may be made over into a suit, dress, skirt, or even a different style of coat for a woman. It may also be made over into any of these same items for a young gitl or a child. In the latter case one must be careful that the fabric and color are suited to the individual for whom the garment is being made.\n\nIn order to provide an opportunity for the sisters of the wards to view the year's accomplishments in the sewing program, no lesson is provided for the month of May. Space does not permit a listing of all the make-over possibilities for a family, but the ensuing lessons will include more details for their use in home sewing.\n\nThe titles of the lessons for 1948-49 are as follows:\n\nLesson 1. Suggestions on Changing Skirt Lengths\n\nLesson 2. Remodeling Dresses An afternoon dress can be made over into a more up-to-date style for a new garment. Skirts and blouses can also frequently be fashioned from dresses that can no longer serve as they are.\n\nLesson 3. Making Women's Wear from Men's Wear A man's suit, coat, or raincoat can be made over into garments for a woman or for one of the children if the color and material are suitable.\n\nLesson 4. Salvage from Shirts Men's shirts can be made over into boys' shirts; into girls' blouses; into aprons and children's play clothes; or even into women's blouses. Here again one must be careful to be sure that colors and fabric designs are appropriate to the wearer.\n\nLesson 5. Outmoded Formals Old formals may be re-used for negligees, underwear, blouses, or afternoon dresses, depending on the type of fabric in the original garment. They can even be used for clever touches in making bedroom furnishings.\nLesson 6. Blouses and Slips Slips, negligees, and nightgowns may be pressed into service for making blouses, vests, underclothing, or a variety of dainty articles for wee tots. House dresses, if not too badly worn or faded, can be used for aprons or children's play clothes.\n\nLesson 7. Using Your Odds and Ends Old shower curtains can be used for dish covers for the ice box, mixing bowl covers, small rain capes, or cases for linens to keep out dust and moths when storing them.\n\nLesson 8 Suggestions on Changing Skirt Lengths Jean Ridges Jennings For Tuesday, October 12, 1948 ALMOST every woman or child sooner or later comes up against the problem of altering or lengthening skirts. At the present time when styles are undergoing a radical change and skirts are all longer than a year or two ago, most of us are faced with the necessity of finding ways to extend our skirts. Not many women can afford to discard clothes just because they are not in the height of fashion. But much can be done to modernize clothes and give them the so-called \"new look.\"\n\nThere are many ways to make your skirts longer. Of first importance, though, is to choose the most suitable way for your particular need. Your plaid wool sports skirt would look foolish with an eyelet pantie ruffle added to its tailored lines. Or if you are as wide now as you care to be, you certainly won't set a series of contrasting bands in your skirt. So choose your lengthening strategy with care for both fabric and figure.\n\nFor a teen-ager who would wear her school skirt a few more months if it were a little longer, try crocheting a wool band at the bottom. If the skirt is cotton, spun rayon or linen, the band should be done in the mercerized crochet cotton. When you add length to a dress in crochet, you should add a touch of the same trimming around the neck or sleeves. In this way the crocheting will seem to be a planned decoration for the outfit, not merely a makeshift.\n\nWhen crocheting or knitting is used as a strip it must always be pressed or blocked into shape to give it a finished look. There are skirts for which an eyelet embroidered ruffle is a perfect and eye-catching finish, particularly full \"dirndles,\" or full gored types. This year when petticoats are so right, you will find this method of lengthening lifts last year's skirt to the height of this year's style. The ruffle can either be on a petticoat or attached to the skirt itself.\n\n'Tack the eyelet ruffle to the skirt by hand. A folded bias band of plaid taffeta would be a perfect lengthener for a plain dark crepe dress. Unify the costume by carrying the same trimming as bands for the neck and sleeves. Another trick is a series of bands inserted in a skirt. Two or three bands may be used. Bands of graduated widths are more interesting than bands of the same width.\n\nIf your dress is short in the waist, you can insert a new waistband of a contrasting material. A dress which has a peplum can be lengthened by inserting a piece of material under the peplum where the piecing will not show. A skirt which has a hem can be faced. This is the simplest of all ways to add length. If the skirt has already been faced, you can still make the skirt longer by adding a band of self-matched or contrasting material to the underside of the facing.\n\nWhen finished, it makes the original hemline appear to be a wide tuck taken just above the hemline for decoration. The band should be doubled or faced and can be stitched to the facing of the original hem. Do not stitch the band to the skirt itself.\n\nNo matter what material or method you choose for lengthening your clothes, be certain to select a material and a style of trimming suitable to the outfit.\n\nSWOULD SCIENCE Latter-day Saint Political Thought Elder G. Homer Durham Preview of Lessons for 1948-49 THROUGHOUT the world a struggle is taking place for men's minds, to influence their political beliefs as a stepping stone to new and uncharted forms of government. Questions of political theory are the questions of the hour.\n\n\"Latter-day Saint Political Thought\" has therefore been selected as social science lesson material for the next two years. Seven lessons during 1948-49 will be devoted to certain main currents. The second year will offer a detailed analysis of the Declaration of Belief Regarding Governments and Laws in General (Doctrine and Covenants, section 134), its application, and general world significance.\n\nThe objective of these lessons is to acquaint and familiarize the women of the Church with some fundamental issues of modern political thought, and to examine pertinent answers thereto as found in the literature and doctrines of the restoration; and thus aid them in teaching their children the meaning and value of free agency and liberty. Men everywhere search for adequate answers to these questions.\n\nCurrently, Communism threatens to engulf Christian civilization. What contribution does Latter-day Saint thought make to modern man's search for sound political theory? In this quest, class leaders and members will have occasion and stimulus to re-examine modern scripture as well as the relevant material in the entire stream of literature of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nIn addition to the standard works, the following useful references are suggested:\n\nSmith, Joseph Fielding: The Progress of Man, Deseret Book Co., 1936, an entire book dedicated to the interpretation of political history in the light of gospel principles. It is one of the few systematic treatises of this type found in our literature.\n\nWright, John A: Man and the Dragon, Bookcraft, 1945, especially part 1, is another recent work dealing with war, peace, social and economic issues."

    "type": "article",
    "content": "The Women of the Mormon Battalion President Amy Brown Lyman The Mormon Battalion was composed of five companies of one hundred men each, all volunteers for their country's service. They were recruited in and about Council Bluffs, and on July 20, 1846, they took up their line of march to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, headquarters for the army of the West, two hundred miles from Council Bluffs. The order from the Government had stated that each company would be allowed four women as laundresses, who would travel with the company receiving rations and other allowances given to laundresses of the regular army. These five companies were therefore entitled to twenty laundresses, and since this provision offered an opportunity for some of the enlisted men to take their wives, the quota was readily raised. With the consent of Captain James Allen, who was in command of the Battalion, a dozen other women were allowed to go. Some of the officers and men who had small families, and who were considered well enough equipped, were permitted to take their families along, and a few took advantage of this opportunity. Then there was a group of seven boys who volunteered to go as servants to some of the officers. Too young to go as soldiers, but brave and patriotic lads, they were willing to go in this capacity. Page 436 When the roster was finally completed, it contained, in addition to the five hundred enlisted men, thirty-two women, thirty-one children, some of whom were half-grown, and the seven boy servants, making a total of 570 in all, who set out on this perilous expedition, for perilous it proved to be. At Fort Leavenworth the Battalion was fully organized and armed. Here it received its equipment, camp accouterments, arms, and provisions, and on August 12, there began the matchless march of two thousand miles from Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, via Santa Fe, New Mexico, to San Diego, California. For men and women alike, the departure of the Battalion was a most trying, yes, tragic experience. Mothers grieved over the taking away of their young sons; and wives and husbands were in the deepest distress at the prospect of that long separation and the uncertainties of the final outcome. An indication of the feelings of many of the men who left their families behind is given by Sergeant William Hyde, who wrote in his journal: The thoughts of leaving my family at this critical time are indescribable. They were far from the land of their nativity, situated upon a lonely prairie with no dwelling but a wagon, the scorching sun beating upon them, with the prospect of the cold winds of December finding them in the same bleak and dreary place. THE WOMEN OF THE MORMON BATTALION It would be difficult to decide which had to endure the greater distress, the wives and mothers, who with their children, were left behind to face that hard and dreadful year when there was so much sickness, poor food, and scarcities of clothing, or those who had dared to brave the terrors of travel in those early days. Of those who remained behind, some were cared for by the Church, some by relatives, while others struggled along making their own way. They were all called upon to endure many trials and hardships during that long and lonely year, but they were brave and courageous, and through their faith, they met them heroically. The husbands sent letters home and also allowances from their army pay whenever there was opportunity to do so, which was not often. Of the rest of their pay, they saved all that they were able, to bring back with them. While a few of these families came on to the Valley and were here reunited with their husbands and fathers, most of them remained in and about Council Bluffs, where their reunion took place. THE women who accompanied the Battalion, in addition to doing the laundry work, made themselves useful in many other ways. They sewed, mended, darned, and helped with the meals. They comforted those who were discouraged and homesick, and helped to nurse the sick. As time went on there was so much sickness and so many accidents, that nursing for these women really assumed great and important proportions. Due to poor food, scarcity of water, and impure and stagnant water, many became 437 ill with stomach and bowel trouble, while others became afflicted with chills and fever (malaria). The chief treatment of the company doctor was the giving of large doses of calomel and arsenic, and as a result, many became badly salivated. Among other discouraging features of the journey were heavy rain, thunder, and wind storms. At one point there was a terrible hurricane, accompanied by rain, which blew down all but five or six of the one hundred tents, upset a number of wagons, and drenched all their belongings. Alternating with these storms were terrible heat waves, when the temperature would often go up to 101° in the shade and 135° in the sun. The uncharted route of travel was rough and uncertain. It led over rough trails, roads, and embankments, through hot, deep beds of sand, and miry clay. The crossing of creeks and larger streams was most difficult. In some instances the wagons had to be let down the steep banks on one side of a stream with ropes, and pulled out by men and horses on the other. After five weeks of slow and interrupted travel with all its handicaps, it was deemed advisable on September 16, 1846, to detach a number of the families and send them up the Arkansas River to Fort Pueblo for the winter under a guard of ten men, with Captain Higgins in charge. This done, the main body of the command continued on to the Southwest. One month later, in October, they reached Santa Fe, the Government fort located halfway between Fort Leavenworth and San Diego. It was now found that a large number of men were too ill to continue the march. Lieutenant 438 Colonel Cook, the commanding officer at this time, therefore decided to send back to Pueblo for the win.\n\nTer these sick men, eighty-six in number, together with all the laundresses and the remaining wives and children of members of the Battalion, except the wives of five officers who were to be personally responsible for them. He was now convinced that the sick men and the women and children would not be able to endure the exposure and fatigue of the rest of the western journey over the mountains. Captain James Brown was placed in charge of the contingent, and one month later they arrived at their destination and established themselves near the camp of Captain Higgins. They were to build themselves cabins and the Government was to supply their food. A month later fifty-five more men were invalided and sent to join them, making a total of 141 sick soldiers.\n\nTHE care of the sick was the chief occupation of the women of Pueblo that winter, for in addition to the invalided soldiers, five babies were born in the little colony, and all alike were tenderly cared for. These women proved to be angels of mercy to all who needed their help, and the men who were ill ever after remembered with gratitude and affection the attention, help, and sympathy given them.\n\nOne of the heroines of the Battalion expedition was Mary Black Brown, wife of Captain James Brown, who later became one of the leading pioneer women of Utah. Captain Brown, who was the founder of Ogden, was greatly aided in the development of that community by his thrifty and resourceful wife. Mary was a Southern girl, born and reared in luxury on a great plantation in the South, where all the labor was performed by the family's slaves. After her marriage, she, with her husband, George Black, joined the Church much against the wishes of her parents, and after a few years, she gave up family, friends, and landed property, and with her husband, joined the saints at Nauvoo.\n\nLeft a young widow in Nauvoo, she moved with the saints to Council Bluffs where, on July 16, 1846, she married Captain Brown, and four days later, with her new husband and young son, David Black, she left with the Mormon Battalion as one of the laundresses of her husband's company. Mrs. Hattie Jenson, granddaughter of Mrs. Brown, in writing of her grandmother's experiences, says: \"Grandmother endured all the hardships incident to that long march and washed for sixteen men and did many other hard tasks she had never done before. She suffered with the heat and thirst, was on soldiers' rations, and became footsore and weary. And at Pueblo where the invalided men were sent under the command of her husband, Captain Brown, she was a ministering angel to them.\"\n\nIn the spring, the soldiers, with the company of Mississippi saints, took up their line of march to Utah, arriving in the Valley on July 29, 1847, five days after Brigham Young and the pioneers arrived. They lived in the fort which was soon constructed, where Pioneer Park now is, and here, three months after their arrival in Salt Lake, Mary gave birth to a daughter. This was the third white child born in Utah, and the first white child to live in what is now Ogden City, where the family moved in February 1848.\n\nSARAH Brown Lowry, of another Brown family, in her thirteenth year traveled with the Mormon Battalion. Her father, James P. Brown, joined the army at Council Bluffs, and after reaching Fort Leavenworth and finding that he could take his family with him, sent for his wife, their daughter, and two sons, to follow him at once, which they were most happy to do. This family was well equipped with two good wagons, two yoke of young oxen for each wagon, three cows, and a tent. The boys drove the teams, and Sarah drove the cows, walking all the way.\n\nWhen the Battalion left Fort Leavenworth, the Brown wagons were placed in the very rear so that Sarah could be near the family, for she still walked and drove the cows, which finally became a monotonous task. In her later years, she often remarked that the Battalion followed the flag and she followed the dust.\n\nThis Brown family was among the first contingent detached from the army on the Arkansas River and sent to Pueblo for the winter. How lonely for Sarah was the prospect of this new assignment! There had been the hum of many voices, the tramp of many feet, the morning sound of fife and drum, calling all from slumber, often when the stars were still shining and there was a long drive to the next water. And there had been the sense of security in numbers.\n\nTo all of this the rosy-cheeked girl, matured beyond her years, had become accustomed, and now all would be different. On the way they encountered a large Arapaho Indian village and naturally were very much concerned, and even frightened. However, when the village was reached, the chief treated them kindly and made it known that he would show them a good place to camp.\n\nSarah was sitting by her mother at the moment, and as the chief passed by, he invited her, in sign language, to ride with him on his horse. The invitation was, of course, promptly but kindly refused. A guard was set out for that night and Sarah said she was sure there was more praying than sleeping done during the night.\n\nAt this place, a most distressing accident occurred. One of the men, Norman Sharp, was accidentally shot with his own gun while drawing it out of the wagon. The chief insisted that Brother Sharp remain with them, as he was sure they could cure him. He could then go on later. Fearing that some harm would come to this handful of people if he refused, Brother Sharp himself decided to remain. So, with his wife and her sister and one of the men, he went back to the village.\n\nNot many days elapsed before Sister Sharp and her two companions returned to the company with the sad news that Brother Sharp had died and was buried by the wayside. A few months later, Sister Sharp gave birth to a baby girl.\n\nSARAH Brown reports that when they reached Pueblo, the company was greatly surprised, but much overjoyed to find wintering there, that brave company of Mississippi saints, who were on their way to the mountains. She says these saints had built log houses in a row fairly close together, and with their consent, the Battalion men constructed theirs in the spaces between, which required the building of only two sides and a roof to each. With the completion of these shelters, the men left their families and, following a mountain trail, proceeded on to report at Santa Fe.\n\nThe next time Sarah saw her father was in late November, when he was brought back to them ill from Santa Fe, with the detachment of invalided soldiers and the remaining families and laundresses under command of Captain James Brown.\n\nAll this winter, she relates, there was much to do in the camp nursing the sick and discouraged men, who were disappointed at not being able to continue on to their proposed journey's end at San Diego. In May 1847, Sarah reports they were all overjoyed when Captain Brown and his aides, who had journeyed to Santa Fe to collect the soldiers' pay, returned with the money and with orders that they were all to march under his leadership to California, by way of Fort Laramie, Wyoming, where the men would be mustered out of service. Their journey began. There was one day's delay, however, for the Browns when Sarah's mother gave birth to a son on the way. The contingent reached Fort Laramie safely and then came on to Salt Lake Valley, arriving on July 29, and here they were permitted to be mustered out of service, as their year of enlistment had already expired.\n\nThe parents of Sarah Brown Lowry were called to Sanpete in 1849, and experienced the terrible incidents connected with the Indian wars in that valley. They settled in Manti, and here at the age of seventeen, Sarah was married to John Lowry, and became the mother of nine noble sons and daughters, among them Mrs. Samuel H. Allen, to whom we are indebted for the privilege of reading her mother's life story.\n\nAlways a devoted Church worker, Sister Lowry finally became one of the prominent pioneer temple workers of the Church, serving for many years in a supervisory capacity in the Manti Temple.\n\nMuch has been said and written of the heroic march and the deeds of the men of the Mormon Battalion, and it is a source of pleasure and pride for the writer to record these words concerning the patience, forbearance, and the heroic deeds of the women of the Battalion.\n\nSUMMER MOON\n\nElaine Swain\n\nTumultuous sounds of summer morning cease:\nA single thread of smoke\nCurls slowly toward immobile clouds\nAs shadows of the early sun decrease;\nRust-colored cattle browse\nAmong chartreuse and emerald hills.\nThese—and a boy, brook-bound—speak of peace."

    "content": "Planning to Provide a Year's Supply\nEider Mark B. Gaiff, Member, General Welfare Committee,\nand Gertrude R. Garff, former Counselor, Relief Society General Presidency\n\nBut if any provide not for his own,\nAnd specially for those of his own house,\nHe hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel (I Timothy 5:8).\n\nThe ultimate temporal success and security\nOf the members of the Church will be determined\nBy the diligence of the people to make themselves self-sustaining in all respects.\nWe must understand that we are not only to sustain ourselves,\nBut also to build up the Church financially\nIn order that the Church as an organization may help those members who have met with misfortune and find it impossible to help themselves.\nEveryone is a potential recipient of help within the Welfare Plan of the Church.\nNo one, with few exceptions, can justify himself in expecting the Church to take care of his need continually.\n\nThe Welfare Plan was given to rehabilitate\nAnd encourage members,\nTo bring them back to a point of self-sufficiency.\nThe plan is not a dole. It is not a process\nOf continually contributing to the individual,\nWho can (when properly directed) be self-sustaining.\nEvery man longs for security, no matter how humble his circumstances may be;\nBut there is no justification in expecting the Church to give us such security\nIf we will not labor with our own hands nor use our own minds.\n\nThe Church cannot support all of its people;\nNor can it insure temporal security to all its members.\nIt can, by our assistance and contributions,\nInsure help to the widow, the fatherless, the handicapped,\nAnd those who may temporarily find themselves in financial difficulty.\n\nThere is much I can do to help myself\nSo that I need not become a burden to the Church\nProvided I have the desire to do so.\nIf the desire does not exist, the outcome will only be negative.\nThe desire must be strong enough that the individual will be willing\nTo labor with his own hands,\nTo recognize that work is honorable,\nThat his hands will be stayed from laying hold upon another man's goods.\n\nThere is a magic of power in the strength of one's own desires!\nWe must live according to our income;\nOur power to save must be greater than our desire to spend.\nWe must live upon less than we can and seek advice\nFrom those who are competent, through their experience and calling,\nTo give advice as to how to make our savings work for us.\n\nWealth and security seem to grow wherever men exert energy in the right direction.\nThere cannot be security without labor;\nThere cannot be progress without experience;\nAnd we cannot prosper without adhering to the counsel of our prophets.\n\nIt seems that if we want to be self-sustaining,\nWe must first look to ourselves as the geniuses\nTo provide such a future.\nOur first obligation is to provide for our own.\nHow this can be accomplished has been considered.\nThe First Presidency has urged you and me, as individuals,\nTo prepare ourselves and our families so that we have a year's supply of food, clothing, and bedding on hand at all times,\nSo that in case of any emergency we will be prepared to assume our own responsibility\nAnd not expect the Church to make this provision for us.\n\nOur supply at the Bishop's storehouse would last only a few days if everyone made demands at once.\nIn fact, under those conditions, the supplies in all the storehouses would be gone in a matter of days.\nThus the only way we could meet an emergency,\nIf one should arise that is widespread,\nWould be for every man to have sufficient on hand\nTo take care of his own.\n\nThis task can be accomplished only by careful preparation.\nThe preparation need not be elaborate, but must be a continual process with watchful planning.\nOpportunity is a haughty goddess who wastes no time with those who are unprepared.\nDepressions show no mercy on empty storehouses and empty stomachs.\n\nThe planning for this preparedness can be most interesting\nAnd stimulating to one's thinking as well as give one an opportunity\nTo work with his own hands.\n\nLet us first consider food:\nIf one would have a year's supply on hand,\nThere must be storage space somewhere within the confines of the home.\n(Some complain that they have no room for such storage, but there is always a way to accomplish such storage if the desire to do so is strong enough.)\nLet it be remembered that we are not hoarding,\nSo that we will not become overbalanced in our efforts.\nWe are providing only staple commodities for our own families.\n\nIn my own family we have made the experiment,\nAnd it has proved very satisfactory in our own instance.\nIt could be helpful to anyone living in the Intermountain area under similar conditions.\n\nIt was decided that our storehouse should be as close to our kitchen as possible.\nAn outside cellar was not what we wanted, as we live in Salt Lake City.\nThere was only one place close to the kitchen,\nAnd that was somewhere in the house.\n\nTHE most logical place seemed to be the coolest place,\nSo we selected the northeast corner of our basement.\nIn trying to estimate our needs and at the same time cut our storage space to a minimum,\nWe decided on a room 5 feet by 19 feet.\n\nPLANNING TO PROVIDE A YEAR'S SUPPLY\n\nIn this space we had to make provision for storing potatoes, carrots, apples, cabbage, beets, citrus fruits, and others.\nAccordingly, we built one bin 13 feet long by 2 1/2 feet wide by 3 1/2 feet high,\nAnd divided it into five compartments.\n(The see plan.)\n\nThe largest compartment was for potatoes.\nThe concrete floor under the bin was removed so as to let the moisture work from underneath the bin;\nAnd a wood floor was installed made of slats about six inches above the dirt level.\n\nIn this way nothing could touch the earth, and dirt from the vegetables could fall through and later be removed from underneath, instead of waiting for the bin to become empty and then clean it from the top. The movement of air from underneath the bin seemed to be advantageous; is the top of each bin is covered with a hinged lid to keep out any light. We believe that potatoes and other root vegetables keep better away from light. We arranged one of the five bins (or compartments) just large enough to take one case of oranges and one case of grapefruit stored side by side, and found that they kept very well up to thirty or forty days. The bin for carrots and red beets had a solid wood bottom so as to hold sand, but was removable when the bin was empty. We packed our carrots and beets in sand and found that they kept well until late spring. You can accomplish the same result with these vegetables by packing them in sand in large cans, provided the room is dark and cool. The bins need not be made of expensive lumber. Scrap lumber can be used. (See plan.) Our next problem was storage of flour, sugar, syrup, honey, macaroni, etc. We constructed a hanging shelf above our bins high enough for the hinged lids to clear underneath when opened. PLANNING TO PROVIDE A YEAR'S SUPPLY This was constructed by hanging brackets from the ceiling joists. The shelf was 1½ feet wide by 13 feet long, hanging about 2 feet down from the ceiling. This provided storage for a year's supply of flour, sugar, and the other items, which can be stored in sacks or cans. (See plan.) Next was the storing of bottled fruit. We constructed fruit shelves directly across from our storage bins. We built 5 shelves out of 1\" by 12\" boards spaced one foot above each other, leaving room on the top shelf to store wheat in cans of about a bushel each. These shelves were in two sections of about 5-foot lengths, with space between the sections of about 3 feet for large cans to be stacked on top of each other. These contained nearly 2 bushels of wheat each. We also stacked wheat in 2-bushel cans at the very end of the walkway. The shelves themselves contained about 400 quarts of fruit. (See plan.) NEXT TO consider was canned goods. We had used 13 of the 19 feet of our storage room, and we had to have 3 feet of wall space for a door. We had the door swing out so as not to use up any of the inside room. Then we made more shelves in an \"L\" shape on the end and the side opposite the doorway. (See plan.) We made the two lower shelves on one side of the \"L,\" 1½ feet wide and 2 feet high, thus giving us space to store cans of 1 and 2-bushel size or packaged goods, such as soap and cleansers. In the large cans we stored rice, dried beans, powdered sugar, vinegar in bottles, dried corn, prunes in 5-packs, and many other items. The hand soap and packaged soap had no taste effect on any of the food items stored in cans. We then had 4 upper shelves of that side and all the shelves of the other side of the \"L\" left for canned goods. Here we stored canned corn, beans, beets, peas, spaghetti, soup of all kinds, ketchup, tomatoes, shrimps, pickles, sardines, salmon, meat, squash, olive oil, spices, and so on. We found to our surprise that we could store a great amount of food. Yes, more than we anticipated; even more space than we had money to buy food for. We supplemented this supply with a small garden in our back yard, about 16 by 80 feet, which each year gives us ample vegetables for our summer use and enough carrots, onions, etc., to augment our winter storage. A summer garden is a big asset to help supply your winter needs, particularly so because the vegetables can be stored when new and fresh and in the best of condition. No family with ordinary means can fill such a storeroom in one year. It is a process of several years of saving and planning, and the hard part is not the building of the storage room itself, but the continual process of keeping your stock moving, and always replacing new stock for that which you have used. If you determine always to put into your storage room more than you take out over a year's time, it will only be a matter of a few years until you have accomplished your purpose. However, you must be like the storekeeper who always keeps \n\nan inventory of his stock, and never lima beans and canned red beets. If his shelves become empty, bottled fruit has kept reasonably well for three years. Keep your bottled fruit off the concrete; store it on wood shelves. Syrup may not keep three years, properly cured honey has kept five years. Of our experience, we have carried on out experiments for six years, and we are very satisfied with the results. At least it is also to be remembered that of your room, about 12 by 12 inches, one foot wide, thus giving you a little more room to walk around and display your supplies. Just what the future holds is a big question, but no matter what may come we feel sure that we are better prepared to meet the future than we were in 1930 when we all suffered financial losses that were hard to endure. Fresh air must come into the room. If you can line your room with %-inch celotex or other insulating material, it will help you to regulate the temperature. Supply of food, clothing, bedding, etc., on hand, let come what may OUR experience has taught us that all the above mentioned commodities can be stored in one room. Dry wheat stored in small containers (not over two bushels) has kept for five years without turning at any time. Rice and beans are in good condition after five years. Hand soap is in excellent condition after three years. Sugar may harden somewhat, but is still good after three years. The Fiddlers Edna S.

Four New Members Appointed to the Relief Society General Board Josie Barnson Bay Evelyn Wilde Heath Former President, San Bernardino Stake Relief Society EWS of the appointment on May 26, 1948, of Josie Barnson Bay Evelyn Wilde Heath Former President, San Bernandino Stake Relief Society NEWS of the appointment on ay 26, 1948, of Jose Barnson Bay to the general board of Relief Society will be happily received by her numerous devoted friends. Words seem so inadequate to express her worth one thinks of the joyous glory of spring, with its sunshine, its warmth, its blossoms lovely blossoms that bring forth precious fruits. Jo, as we affectionately call her, is like that joyous, enthusiastic, progressive, with an infectious smile, and a heart that holds much warmth, friendliness, humility, and understanding. Like the blossoms, she is not only lovely and charming, but she, too, brings forth precious fruits of wisdom, edifying all who associate with her. Her great knowledge and testimony of the gospel are results of capable and untiring service in the Church. One of her finest qualities is her sincere love for people, which brings her that great power to organize, to gain co-operation, unity, and, consequently, unmeasured success. Josie was born in Junction, Utah, the daughter of John and Hannah Barnson, both staunch Latter-day Saints. JOSIE BARNSON BAY Her first responsible positions in Church work were: Primary president, then Y. W. M. I. A. President, both of Junction Ward. After her marriage to Ira M. Bay, who is most loyal and helpful and a sincere Church worker, they served as missionaries in the California Mission. Her first experience in Relief Society work was at that time as a counselor. Page 513 Since that introduction, she has served Relief Society in the following positions: president of Junction Ward; first president of Boulder City Ward; president of San Bernardino Ward; stake secretary of Garfield Stake; stake president of San Bernardino Stake for six years. She next was stake Y.W.M.I.A. president of San Diego Stake for two years. Her last service, before moving to Salt Lake, was as stake Relief Society president of San Diego Stake, where she served for two and one half years. In each position her work has been outstanding and glorious. She is the mother of six children, five daughters: Madeline, Dawn, Anna Dee, Jo Iris, Drusilla, and one son Francis McMurrin Bay, now serving in the East Central States Mission. This appointment is a fitting reward for her worthy achievements. May glorious blessings be hers, always."

This is evidenced in the appointment of Christine Hinckley Robinson to membership on the general board of Relief Society, May 26, 1948. A daughter of Bryant S. Hinckley and Christine Johnson, she responded to the refining influence of the gospel as her parents and grandparents lived it in strength and beauty.\n\nWhen a baby, Christine's mother died. With the close companionship of her sister Carol, she matured in an atmosphere of love and artistry in the home of her maternal grandparents, Brother and Sister Niels Johnson of Provo, Utah. The Provo schools, and eventually the Brigham Young University, launched her on an extensive scholastic program which was continued in New York after her marriage to O. Preston Robinson. It was at the B. Y. U. that the two met.\n\nSince then they have achieved success and wide recognition together—she in interior decorating, he in marketing. CHRISTINE HINCKLEY ROBINSON\n\nSister Robinson was an instructor in the Foster School of Fine Arts in New York City. Together, they wrote the textbook Successful Retail Salesmanship. Teamwork stands out as their most enviable accomplishments, each complimenting and magnifying the other. Such co-operation will be a real asset in Christ's new Relief Society assignment.\n\nHer Church activities have consistently paralleled her varied civic, academic, and creative work. With experience in all the Church auxiliaries, the emphasis has been in Relief Society. For fifteen years she served successfully as ward class leader, counselor, and in the presidency of the New York Stake Relief Society.\n\nThe three Robinson children, Miriam, Bruce Hinckley, and Christine Carol, find ample opportunity for individuality in the midst of their mother's artistic expression in home and garden.\n\nEndowed with deep spiritual insight and keen creative intellect, Sister Robinson has developed increasing capacity for leadership. She genuinely loves people and loves life. She inspires faith because she relies on faith. She builds strength in others because she has strong convictions.\n\nThe vitality of her testimony of the gospel was recently demonstrated in a practical way. She and her family, after living for nearly twenty years in New York, chose to leave bright fields of success to make their home in Utah with the body of the Church.\n\nAs a member of the general board, Sister Robinson will be a power for good. Her inheritance, experience, and training eminently fit her for service in this great organization. She has, in a high degree, the fundamental requirements for effective Relief Society work—a love for, and sympathetic understanding of people, with an ardent desire to help. Artistic in temperament, clear in her thinking, warm-hearted and generous, she makes friends and promotes every cause in which she engages."

One of the younger members of a large and talented family, she was educated in the schools of Utah and received her A.B. degree in English literature at Brigham Young University, where she was an honor student, active in dramatics, and editor of the literary magazine.\n\nHer service in Church organizations began with Sunday School teaching and has continued through nearly all the auxiliaries, including executive positions in ward and stake Relief Societies. She was also a counselor in New York Stake Y.W.M.I.A. and a stake missionary, serving to Salt Lake City. Berta has ably served as a member of Emigration Stake Relief Society board and has contributed greatly to the many outstanding activities which this stake has so successfully carried out.\n\nNEW BOARD MEMBERS\n\nActively interested in genealogical research, Berta has completed many records for her family. She has exceptional organizing ability which enables her to use her time and energy to best advantage with grace and dignity. Blessed with many artistic gifts, Berta has been an award winner in several Eliza R. Snow poem contests and has contributed frontispiece poems of exceptional quality to the Magazine. Her literary compositions have appeared in many other publications, and musical arrangements have been made for a number of her poems. She is well known as a reader of poetry, and her painting, in several mediums, is of exceptional originality and reveals exquisite technique.\n\n\"Multiple-gifted\" applies to Berta, for she has additional talents in the domestic and fine arts. Berta's husband, Dr. Carl J.

The annual General Relief Society Conference will convene on September 29 and 30. The morning session on September 30 will be held in the Tabernacle from 10 a.m. to 12 noon and will feature the Relief Society Building Fund program. It is hoped there will be an official representative from each of the stakes of Zion, and from many missions, so that recognition may be given to every stake and mission which completes its quota. At that session announcement will be made of the amount of money which has been collected.\n\nIt is the earnest prayer of the general board that every stake in the Church may be thus recognized, and all Relief Society members may be listed as contributors.\n\nThe lists of contributions will not be called for until after the completion of the fund-raising period, allowing each sister the full fund-raising year in which to make her quota payment, and Special and Memorial Gifts. As the time draws to a close, increasingly there are Memorial Gifts being made. Sometimes this is done by individuals. Other times families unite in making one large Memorial Gift for a beloved mother or grandmother. The gifts are credited either in the ward in which the individual making the gift lives or in the ward in which the person memorialized lived. In one instance a gift was made by a great-granddaughter to the ward in Salt Lake where her great-grandmother had lived who had joined the Relief Society in Nauvoo. Every daughter and daughter-in-law in some families is making an individual Memorial Gift to her mother so that each one's name appears with that of the mother. Wherever the gifts are made, both the name of the donor and the name of the one being memorialized will be placed in the cornerstone.\n\nAccording to the present plan, a great book will be made containing the names of all who contribute to the Relief Society building, to be preserved in a special case in the building which will stand as a lasting tribute to the faithfulness of Relief Society members today.\n\nMissions Which Have Sent In 100% Building Quotas:\nNorthern California Mission\nEastern States Mission\nHawaiian Mission\nSamoan Mission\nNew Zealand Mission\n\nStakes Which Have

CHAPTER 1 Edith Russell, elder brother Michael was reading, which means that for purposes of ordinary communication, he was quite dead. He was not merely engrossed, he was oblivious. My mother, having passed him four times on her way to and from the kitchen, and having accommodatingly climbed over his protruding legs four times in so doing, endeavored to call to his attention the great desirability of his retiring to his room, there to continue his perusal of great literature with less inconvenience to the family at large. Michael gave no indication of having heard. My mother continued her trips to the kitchen. She returned carrying a large bowl of hot water. She said no more, but a moment later Michael drew in his legs with a voice of protest. \"Really, Mother! Can't a fellow...? I was reading about those chaps called Mormons,\" he expostulated, as though that should explain his intense preoccupation. \"Michael!\" My mother was horrified. \"Those dreadful people! Why, I remember when I was a girl, they visited even the best parts of town, trying to induce nice girls to leave their homes and go with them to Salt Lake City.\" Michael grinned. \"Oh, Mother, come now!\" he protested, gently disbelieving. \"It's true. I never saw one myself, but at the time it was on everybody's lips.\" Michael was turning the pages of the book, looking for some passage. \"Zane Grey,\" he said, \"thinks they are a decent people.\" My mother spread her feathers and exuded indignation. \"Michael, I shall appreciate it if you will not indulge in such literature in the future. I do not like it!\" The little woman resumed her interrupted perambulations to and from the kitchen with renewed vigor, her face a mask of disapproval. Michael looked at me, then at the book now lying in the chair. Then he shrugged and went out. SIX years later the second world war was moving a bloody finger across the map of Europe. Michael was in the East; his place at home was taken by my younger brother, Antony. We led quiet, uneventful lives in the small, sturdy cottage situated on the fringe of the lonely Haworth moors. The peaceful monotony of our existence might be attributed to the fact that although we lived at least on the outskirts of the village, we were not accepted as villagers. My mother was a \"city woman.\" We children had been born in the city, and after fifteen years of living in the village, we were still regarded with curiosity and the sort of aloof respect accorded to strangers. Furthermore, at no time in our lives had we made any attempt to enter that little circle of social life and common purpose, represented by the church. The Russells did not go to church. They never had, unless impelled there by new life or its surcease, or the occasional determination of a Russell bride to have the church solemnize her matrimonial contract. We did not go to church as we did not get drunk. The family, in either case, simply would not have condoned it. Ours was a happy family life, undeviating, unimaginative, smooth. We enjoyed solidarity as a family, but it was the nature of each of us to like to be alone. Antony rode a great deal, as a friendly farmer was not averse to letting him exercise his horses. He was sixteen and blond, with all the energy of a colt. He would be gone all day, then come home at nightfall to eat an enormous supper in the kitchen. My mother worried about him if he was warm enough, if he was safe. But he was like thin whipcord.\n\nHe hated any kind of fuss, and was as sensitive as a girl. Michael sweated with the Royal Air Force in Cairo. For my part I had my room and the lanes and fens surrounding the moors. I read a great deal, alone in my room. My small chamber was recognized as sacred, and no one, not even my mother, trespassed there. Michael had painted the walls when it was first given to me, and once when I was sick, he had come in to visit me. Antony was oddly shy of it, though it was not a very feminine room. It was my sanctuary. I intimately lived there.\n\nWalked a great deal and usually alone. About a mile from the house was the parish church of St. Matthews and unfailingly in my walks, I went past the old place, a trifle curious as to what went on behind the stout Gothic walls. I was sometimes tempted to go in. On Tuesday evening the villagers would be at choir practice and the sound of their strong, country voices would float out into the mellow dusk. I used to think, vaguely, of our family conception of church people—narrow, vindictive, transcendently uncharitable. Ostensibly, they were the reason we did not go to church. We had heard that the vicar himself was an irascible gentleman, a Welshman, much given to fire and brimstone, and to denouncing the villagers who did not attend Holy Communion as devils incarnate. The much-maligned villagers had stoned him once, and the big, helmeted police force had broken up the crowd.\n\n\"Religion? Bah!\" was the unvoiced opinion of our house. What did religion engender but strife and bad feeling? What emotions did it inspire other than hatred and malice and resentment? Honor thy father as well as thy mother, the commandments said. But my father had not inspired honor in his children. He had slipped out of our lives before even our memories could claim him. Religion spelled confusion.\n\nThe Russells did not go to church.\n\nBut in my walks, the old church of St. Matthews held a strange fascination for me. Walking home across the fields from Henwden, I would mount the hill and see it lying there in the valley, oddly like a jewel in the hollow of a hand. The dying sun would be caught in its turrets; its leaded windows would flash gold, burn somberly, then fade like the embers of an untended fire.\n\nONE evening during the second summer of the war, I stopped at the edge of the church, ostensibly to admire the long, yellow tassels of the laburnum, but actually, my attention was caught by the playing of a Bach fugue on the organ. There was no one about, and quickly I crossed the wide burial ground and pushed open the immense door under the west tower.\n\nMy first impression was one of trapped sunlight—great slanting pillars of it, made tangible and golden by an omnipresent dust. My next was one of loftiness, spaciousness, supplemented by the grand austerity of Bach.\n\nThe organist, an old man I had seen often in the village, turned his head as I entered, but returned immediately to his playing. I was glad. My temerity frightened even myself and I had no wish to exchange pleasantries.\n\nI entered a pew just within the door and sat down. I wanted to analyze myself; to say to myself, I am in church. This is St. Matthews. I am in church, and to see how it feels.\n\nI was disloyal, of course. The Russells did not go to church. My mother and Michael and Antony, too, would think me confoundedly odd to have come here. Why had I come? I didn't know. The music, perhaps. Curiosity.\n\nI sat for a little while, letting my senses stray into the crannies of this adventure. The organist changed to Brahms. He played very softly. It occurred to me that in church it was only polite to pray. To say nothing would be like ignoring your host. But the idea embarrassed me. I had no idea what people said to God. It was evident, though, that in church one could not be informal with the Almighty.\n\nI looked at the altar for possible inspiration, at the great brass cross and the purple velvet runner on which were embroidered the letters I.H.S. \"In his service,\" perhaps they meant. I looked up at the remote, dome-like ceiling, upon which the plaster had begun to crack, and felt the immense loneliness and solitude of the place. But no words came.\n\nTHE pulpit was laved by a sea of empty pews. The man at the organ ceased playing, suddenly, in the middle of a bar, gathered up his music, and disappeared through a side door. The silence was unexpected and awful. How did one pray in church? What did one say? I had a feeling God was waiting, implacably waiting.\n\nThere was a maxim in the family about courtesy—\"Courtesy costs nothing.\" One should be courteous to one's host, even if he happens to be God.\n\nAwkwardly, I slipped to my knees. The quiet pressed down on me, oppressive and weighted with awe. 526 I put my hands together and closed my eyes tightly. \"Dear God,\" I said, \"forgive me for disturbing you...\" Nothing else. Nothing else would come. I rose and hurried down the aisle, pushing open the great door beneath the west tower. A few seconds more and I was in the mild stillness of the churchyard again. The church was behind me, massive, silent, empty, yet breathing!\n\nMichael would laugh when they wrote to tell him I had gone to church. They would all think it so funny. Perhaps it was. Perhaps I should laugh, too. I rallied all my sense of humor, but fully marshalled, it brought no laughter to my lips. A sense of sadness oppressed me and an unaccustomed sensation of unrest. The feeling remained with me that God was waiting, waiting. And his patience was infinite.\n\nI hurried my footsteps up the hill toward home. The cottage stood on the crest, solid, old as the church, a haven of comfort. My mother sat before the fire, knitting a gray thing for Antony. She looked up as I went in. \"Mother,\" I said, and my voice was that of the penitent before his confessor. \"Mother, I have been to church!\" My mother put down her knitting.\n\n(To be continued)\n\nESSENTIALS\n\nAlice Whitson Norton\n\nI love the things with which I've lived\nThroughout my entire life,\nLike grandma's quaint old soup tureen,\nAnd granddad's carving knife;\nMy father's pewter shaving mug\nAn old four-poster bed,\nA comfort made from scraps of silk,\nAnd brier-stitched in red;\nOdd pieces of old silverware,\nAnd bits of dainty lace;\nThe old clock on the mantelpiece\nWith bruises on its face;\nMy mother's armless rocking chair,\nHer little darning gourd;\nA candelabrum made of brass\nA rusty bladed sword.\n\nSo long these things I love have been a vital part of me,\nWithout them I am like a ship lost on a windswept sea."

    "content": "Storing Food in a Basement Velma N. Simonsen Counselor, General Presidency of Relief Society\n\nThe Latter-day Saints believe that God is as much concerned with the affairs of men today as he was in the days of ancient Israel. And as Joseph was instructed to prepare his people for a day of need, the word of the Lord, coming through his prophets to us today, is to have on hand at least one year's supply of food.\nDoes this sound like a Herculean task? Do you feel that it is impossible for city folk, living in small houses on limited budgets, to obey this counsel?\nWe have found that it can be done and it is lots of fun. We first made a list of the foods and the amounts we would need for our family for the year. We included in our storage paper napkins, waxed paper, soap, and other household necessities.\nWe made our purchases according to our list. Of course, few families can afford to go out and at one time buy a year's supply of food and supplies and store them, but by wise budgeting we can buy a case of food at a time or a sack of flour one week and a quantity of sugar another week.\nSome families make a practice of buying two of everything they need, one for immediate use and one for storing. In any event, as you use from your storage supply be sure to replace it so that you may maintain your one year's supply constantly.\n\nMy husband and I were both reared in families where it was expedient and natural to store a year's supply of food. Therefore the word \"hoarding\" has little meaning for us.\nWe try to keep at least a year's supply of provisions on hand at all times, because we were trained in our youth to do so, and because it is the counsel given us of the Lord through his prophets.\nWe are a family of six and all the storage space we have is a basement closet and a small fruit room. On shelves, in the closet, we store staples that do not need to be kept too cool, and which keep indefinitely, such as dried beans, split peas, macaroni products, spices, rice, flavoring, soaps, and such.\nWe find the tin cannister sets that can be bought very cheaply in the dime stores or gallon ice-cream cartons or any cans with tight lids are splendid to store these foods in.\n\nIn the fruit room, in order to assure good circulation of air, we cut a hole about 9\" x 12\" in the wall near the floor; over this we put an open grill. We ran a 12\" x 12\" pipe from the ceiling of the fruit room between the joists to the outside and put an open grill and screen over both ends of this pipe to keep out bugs and mice.\nOn the fruit room shelves we keep our home-bottled fruits and vegetables, jams, and jellies. Under the shelves we store the case-lot purchases of canned meat, fish, milk, vegetables, fruit, shortening, flour, cereals, and sugar.\nWe usually keep five or six sacks of flour on hand at all times and have done so for the past fifteen years and have not had one sack infected with weevil. The \"trick\" is to make sure one sack of flour does not touch another sack of flour.\nTo avoid this, when stacking, we put a sack of flour then a sack of sugar then a sack of flour and so on, or we lay some of the flour on top of a case of vegetables. We always put slats of wood between the cement and the articles stored, as the cement has a tendency to \"sweat,\" and the wood keeps the moisture from the stored food.\n\nIn the fall of the year we buy three sacks of potatoes, a sack of small size onions for cooking whole (try creaming them with peas or string beans, they are delicious!); a sack of large size onions for slicing, a bushel of carrots, a half-bushel of parsnips, and several bushels of apples.\nThe potatoes we stand on slats of wood on the fruit room floor. For us, these keep firm and fresh from October until May when the new potatoes come on the market.\nThe onions we store in the mesh bags in which they are purchased. We make sure the onions are thoroughly dry before storing by leaving them in the garage until there is danger of them freezing, then we hang them from a nail on the wall in the fruit room so they may get better circulation, or just stand the sacks on slats of wood on the fruit room floor.\nWe check the onions occasionally and discard any that seem to be going soft or spoiling. In this way the onions keep firm and fresh until May.\n\nStoring carrots is a simple process. We wash them, cut off the tops, put them in a creamery can, place the lid on the can loosely, and stand the can on the fruit room floor.\nThe can works on the same principle as the hydrator in an ice box, keeping the carrots moist and crisp until spring, and very handy to get at. We are always careful that the lid is replaced loosely.\n\nThe parsnips are stored the same as the carrots only in a smaller container.\nThe apples we store in the garage. We put the box of apples inside a larger box with crumpled newspaper between the two boxes and on top; over it all, we fold an old blanket. This is enough insulation to keep the apples from freezing and the low temperatures keep them firm.\n\nIn this land of plenty, some may question the necessity of storing food, but no one has ever lost by obeying the counsel of the Lord's anointed and the added convenience and the feeling of security that one obtains from obeying this counsel are well worth the try.\nThis method of storing food has worked well for us. You may have a better way, but in any event keep at least one year's supply ahead. By so doing you can save money and keep prepared for the unknown future. It can be done and it's lots of fun.\n\nMirror Caroline Eyring Miner\nYou are my mirror, Daughter of mine;\nMake my reflection with kindliness shine."

    "content": "Storing Food in a Two-Room Apartment Esther Clark Naylor\n\nIn the matter of storing food in my small, heated apartment I have been rather successful. To do this I have had to use care, when the heat was on in the winter months, to select an outside wall or corner of the rooms where there are no heated pipes in the wall or the floor, to stack the cases of food against the wall or in the corner.\n\nThen in the summertime the food should be moved to an inside wall or closet, the coolest place in the room.\n\nIn this way I have been able to keep the food until it was used up, usually from two to three years. I make my plans to store a two-year supply every summer.\n\nThe canned foods stored consist of string beans, peas, corn, tomatoes (if I do not home can the tomatoes), tomato soup, vegetable soup, grapefruit, canned milk, and honey, with some canned meat and fish. The canned milk should be turned over every week or two. By doing this, milk can be kept for at least one year. Of course, dried beans and rice will keep indefinitely. I am now using beans and rice that were purchased about six years ago. However, the rice must be watched to avoid the weevil getting into it. I think the sealed package would be the safest, although I have been successful in storing the loose rice, by putting it in very thick paper bags and placing these bags in a very heavy seamless sack and tying each sack tightly.\n\nButter also can be stored for at least one year if kept in sealed bottles in the refrigerator. Before storing, melt the butter over heat that is hot enough to send the curd or whey to the bottom and then pour the pure butter fat into a well-sterilized bottle, and seal. Care should be taken that no curd goes into the bottle. There is no waste in this method, as the curd or whey can be used in cookie making.\n\nIn storing home-canned fruits, such as peaches, applesauce, plums, etc., I have used the same method of storage as for the storage of canned foods. I keep one year's supply ahead, sometimes more. The jams and jellies I store in my cupboards, but I always seal the jams as I do the fresh fruit.\n\nI haven't been very successful in storing cheese for a very long period of time. I have kept flour successfully by lining a wall behind a door with brown paper and stacking flour in sacks, surrounding each sack with brown paper. It kept for over a year.\n\nIn planning a storage for a single person in a two-room apartment it is helpful to estimate food needs. A can of peas will last for four meals; a one-quart bottle of fruit will last for five meals; a large can of tomatoes will provide a serving for each of five meals.\n\nPage 529\n\nSixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, August 1, and August 15, 1888\n\"For THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ZION AND THE RIGHTS OF THE Women oF ALL NaTIONs\"\nTHE TWENTY-FOURTH: The commemoration of the anniversary of the entrance of the Pioneers into this valley was celebrated last month with appropriate services in the large Tabernacle, an immense concourse of people being in attendance. It was forty-one years since the company of Pioneers arrived where Salt Lake City now stands. The grand organ was handsomely draped with the stars and stripes, and a steel engraving of President Brigham Young hung in the centre among the national colors. Underneath it a banner bore the one word \"Unity.\" The three stands were draped with national flags, and the platform in front of the stands, used on such occasions, was tastefully ornamented with flowers and plants in bloom.

Cannon\nWOMEN are trying to correct some important misfortunes among the nations of the world. They became increasingly cognizant of these ills at the last meeting of the International Council of Women in Philadelphia, toward the end of last year. They learned that some countries have very unsanitary milk and some countries have no milk. In at least fifteen nations women are not yet allowed to vote. In Poland live 600,000 orphan children born out of wedlock during the war. The women are working to carry out a three-year program dealing with peace, health, relief, and education.\n\nJARRELL, only woman school superintendent in a United States city of more than 200,000 population, occupies that position in Atlanta, Georgia. When she began teaching, she asked to work with the underprivileged children. She has introduced many reforms into the conservative Atlanta schools, among them the startling innovation of coeducation.\n\nFRANCES CLEVELAND, as the bride of Grover Cleveland, was the youngest First Lady in the United States.

She takes an active part in the work of the Latter-day Saint Church in the French mission.\n\nFormer Utah girl, Miss Charlotte Knight, daughter of Mrs. Ray Knight of Canada, has established a Far Eastern office for the New York magazine Air Force in faraway Tokyo, Japan.

The small room in which the mother sat was clean and neat, but through the crack of a half-opened door could be glimpsed the bedroom where the baby slept, in which was an unmade bed and toys and clothing strewn about. If only the baby were a sound sleeper, the mother thought, so she could clean the room while he slept. She relaxed for a moment letting her lids close after the hard work of the morning's wash. She was aroused by a light tapping at her apartment door. Silently opening the door, she beheld her next-door neighbor, a dear friend, standing with a welcoming smile on her face. \"I know you're dead tired,\" she whispered, \"with the baby crying so much in the night. I've come to stay while you get some fresh air. Just leave everything the way it is and put on your coat and go,\" she coaxed.\nBecause of the genuine concern mirrored in her friend's eyes, the mother gratefully accepted the offer. In a few minutes she was enjoying the brisk air, slowly drawing back into her body a sense of peace and relaxation to strengthen her for the further cares of the day.\nA friend! What an outpouring of love and unselfish devotion the word expresses. In the midst of sorrow, of suffering and trouble, the strength of friendship will sustain and provide a protecting mantle against the shades of darkness and despair.\nFriendship, however, to grow and become stronger than adversity, needs tender care and cultivation nourished with appreciation and understanding. Both parties to a friendship must unselfishly serve. It will be but a precarious friendship where all the giving is on one side and the taking on the other. Everyone who would be a friend has something to offer, for the giving of oneself, of one's talents, encouragement, and gratitude, far outweigh material gifts.\nLove begets love and the more one gives the more one has to give. One person departs, leaving scarcely a remembrance behind. Another leaves and almost each hour of every day a nostalgic memory arises. The difference may largely be accounted for by the amount of service performed by the two, by the expression of their friendship.\nIt is blessed to be a friend; it is blessed to have a friend. Both conditions require doing and not mere being. All the effort expended is more than repaid for. \"A friend loveth at all times,\" and will be dearly prized even after death comes.\n\nM. C.

The conventions have been planned to occupy one day and will begin with a stake board meeting at 10 A.M., conducted by the home stake Relief Society president. Matters of importance to stake boards will be considered in this meeting and the discussion will be led by representatives from the Relief Society general board.\nAn officers and class leaders meeting will be held from 11 A.M. to 12:45 P.M. for stake board members, ward presidencies, secretary-treasurers, class leaders, and work meeting leaders. Members of the stake presidency, high council, and bishoprics are also invited to this meeting. Following the opening exercises and remarks from Relief Society officers, two departmental meetings will be held: (1) for presidencies, secretary-treasurers, magazine representatives; (2) for class leaders.\nA general session is scheduled for the afternoon, to be conducted by the visiting stake Relief Society president. Stake and ward officers and class leaders are to attend the meeting, and priesthood representatives and visiting teachers are invited.\n\nAnnual Relief Society General Conference September 29 and 30, 1948\nPLANS are well underway for the annual Relief Society general conference to be held on Wednesday and Thursday, September 29 and 30, 1948, immediately preceding the Church semi-annual general conference.\nThe plan for the Relief Society general conference calls for a morning officers meeting in the Assembly Hall for stake board members on Wednesday, with departmental meetings to be held simultaneously in the afternoon. A reception which stake board members and mission Relief Society presidents will be invited will be held in the evening at the Hotel Utah.\nBoth meetings on Thursday will convene in the Tabernacle and be open to the general public.\nThe morning session from 10 A.M. to 12 noon will feature the conclusion of the Relief Society Building Fund program. It is expected that an official representative of every stake and mission achieving 100% or more of its Building Fund quota will be present and recognition given them.

The afternoon session in the Tabernacle will be addressed by members of the general authorities, and Relief Society general board members. This conference will be remembered as one of the most memorable occasions in the history of Relief Society, and it is the earnest hope of the general board that great numbers of Relief Society members from faraway as well as nearby may be in attendance.\n\nStake presidents are requested to have their ward presidents announce the conference at the Relief Society summer meetings. Heat Waves and Salad Days\nElizabeth Williamson\n\nURING the hot summer do eat outdoors if you possibly can. To entertain your friends, but don't let the weather get you down. With a little psychology and hardly any exertion you can serve a delicious luncheon and make your guests forget the hot weather. And as red and yellow give one a sense of warmth in winter, green and white give one a feeling of coolness in summer. Try to plan your menu and table decorations with cool colors in mind.\n\nMENU\nCHILLED SOUP This can be consomme, served with a slice of lemon, or perhaps a cold pea soup served with a sprinkling of parsley.\nLARGE FRUIT SALAD Serve in individual wooden bowls or large, deep dishes. On a bed of chilled crisp lettuce, heap: chilled white grapes, chunks of pineapple, green melon balls, pieces of grapefruit, and avocado if you choose (it is a fruit and goes equally well with fruits or vegetables). Crisp and cold.\nREMEMBER that to have a successful salad, the greens must always be\nDRESSING FOR THE SALAD Use mayonnaise to which has been added whipped cream, or mayonnaise thinned with a small amount of fruit juices.\n\nBREAD Serve hot rolls or tiny baking powder biscuits which can be prepared ready for baking earlier (in the cool of the morning). Or you may buy a prepared mixture for making delightful little buttermilk biscuits that pop out of the container into the oven.\n\nIf it seems too much of a task to make hot bread, you can serve small water-cress sandwiches 534 days it often seems an effort. Color plays a leading role. Just HEAT WAVES AND SALAD DAYS 535 sandwiches. Add a small amount of mayonnaise to the chopped water cress. Be sure to cut off the crusts of the bread. These little sandwiches are especially refreshing and are wonderful for an afternoon refreshment as well as a luncheon. DESSERT Prepare a frosty sherbet, either lemon or orange. Use the fresh fruit juices and the grated rind. Just add two cups of milk and a cup of granulated sugar or a cup of Karo syrup. Place in your refrigerator trays until it is solid, then remove and stir until very smooth. Return the sherbet to the refrigerator, and this time do not let it freeze, but keep it rather at a mushy but firm consistency. A REFRESHING DRINK Serve a frosty, tall drink and add a piece of mint for garnish. TABLE DECORATIONS Use the flowers in season, or branches of green leaves are effective. A centerpiece of bright yellow lemons with green leaves is unusual and striking. Place this centerpiece directly on the table and not in a container. It will be cool-looking and practical. And last, but certainly not least, as a charming hostess, remember you, too, must appear fresh and cool-looking. Your guests will relax and you will have a wonderful time. Synopsis: Andrew Rumgay leaves his mother and his fiancée Jane Alhson in Scotland and joins his friend Hugh Shand to emigrate to America. They meet Mother MacKinlay and her son Bob, whom they had known while doing missionary work, and become acquainted with Kathleen Coleman and her friend Margaret Purvis. Hugh and Kathleen are married on board the ship. While in Iowa, preparing for the handcart journey across the plains, Margaret tells Mother Mac that she is in love with Andrew, and Kathleen tells the two women that she is expecting a baby. They journey on and survive the autumn storms. Andrew is missing one night and Margaret goes to his rescue and brings him back safely. The Saints in Zion send food to them, and Margaret leaves the Macs to go with Brother Brown to Tooele, Utah. Isn't it wonderful, Andrew? If my home in heaven is this grand, I'll be satisfied.\" Yes, Mother,\" slowly affirmed the young man. \"I think I get what you mean. You will need a few more rooms in your mansion, but on the whole I think you can manage with this one for a time.\" Your large rooms, with shelves built in the kitchen and in the bedrooms; the well is here on the east side; the woodhouse is around the back,\" she enumerated, pointing out to Andrew the advantages of her new home. Do you see how the mountains rise from my very doorstep? When I'm not busy I will sit by the window and study the mountains. I will never be lonesome with all this beauty around me.\" \"You never would be lonesome, anyway,\" Andrew said, looking into Mother Mac's calm blue eyes. \"But, Page 536 for sure, this is the most beautiful spot I've ever seen.\" The rugged mountains, towering majestically into the clear blue skies, were beautiful in every tint and coloring of the spring. The sunshine glistened on stately trees, and danced with every shrub and flower in the soft-bedded nooks and glades of the sidehill. Mother turned to the west and looked for a long time at the shimmering beauty of the silvery blue fresh-water lake—a mirror, reflecting all of the radiance and grandeur of its surroundings. The river, singing on its way through the high green valleys, down over rocky crags and precipices, had found, at last, a soft loamy bed on the last lap of its journey before losing itself in the still, gleaming waters of the lake. The only thing out of harmony with the beauty of the valley was the fort. \"It is such a pity that men have to build places of safety for themselves and families,\" Mother Mac said, reflectively. \"We may be very glad to accept its security!\" Andrew was rapidly becoming acquainted with both the opportunities and the dangers of the new home in the West. \"I'm not seeking any interviews with the red men.\" Mother Mac looked anxiously toward the mountains. \"I remember them only too well on the plains. They never did find that young boy who was stolen from our company. How I sympathize with his poor mother and relations.\" QUESTING LIGHTS \"We had to be constantly on the alert, or they would have taken others.\" Andrew remembered his own fears on that memorable night when he was lost in the blizzard. \"Well, my son, we have been greatly blessed of the Lord, since coming to Utah. You have a good job with the Hunters; Hugh and Kathleen and Father Coleman have rented a place for the time being, and I'm waiting for my money to come from Scotland, to finish paying for my home.\" \"We're lucky, indeed,\" very thoughtfully returned the young man. UGH and Kathleen came to see the new home. They were interested in every feature which Mother was constantly adding. They went into the living room. It had been a long time since they had all been together. Mother wanted them to stay for dinner, so Bob went for Brother Coleman. \"What have you been hearing from Jane, Andrew?\" Kathleen asked as she began preparing the vegetables. \"Does your mail come through any better?\" \"I haven't heard for sometime, but she doesn't hear from me, either. These twenty-five-cent pieces in American silver are very hard for me to find. I write every time I get one, but sometimes there is a long wait between letters. I have explained everything to Jane, and I'm sure she understands. I'll be very happy when the little lady arrives in Utah. I get so lonesome that even Resplendence, this valley of sunshine and enchantment, gets very dark and dreary at times. \"I remember Jane!\" Bob volunteered. \"I saw her at conference in Cowdenbeath. Remember?\" Andrew smiled assent. \"She was just about the prettiest girl at church,\" Bob continued. \"She had long, golden curls and sparkling blue eyes. She wasn't quite as tall as you are, but one thing I definitely remember, Jane was always smiling. Life must have been very good to that little bonnie lass.\" \"I hope she still has her curls, and smiles,\" Andrew remarked, with a faraway look in his eyes. OTHER came out from the kitchen. \"The problems of the plains are still with us. What shall we do for chairs? Oh, Bob! The boxes in the woodhouse! I bought them for kindling this morning. Now they will make dining room chairs, for a time.\" Mother smiled. She bustled around, completing the last-minute details. \"Dinner is served, my children. It is like old times, isn't it? We must do this often. My latch strings are always out.\" \"Well, in some ways, it is like old times,\" Andrew offered. \"I always miss Margaret at these gatherings.\"\n\nDoes she write often? What is she doing?\" \"No, not very often. She's too busy,\" Mother answered, with a questioning glance at Andrew. \"Wasn't it strange for Margaret to leave us so suddenly, and go to the Stuarts in Tooele?\" Father Coleman asked. \"No, not when you know the whole story,\" Mother explained. \"Margaret was as close to Grandpa Stuart and Grandma Stuart as if she had been their own child. She was their daughter Betsey's best friend. They worked together at the flax mills in Arbroath. Grandpa Stuart taught Margaret the gospel, and baptized her. When her own people learned that Margaret was a Mormon they were very unhappy about it. She stayed with the Stuarts until they emigrated to Utah. A short time after they left, Margaret's mother died. She worked and paid all the funeral expenses because her brothers were married and had large families. Then she worked for her fare to Zion. I'm grateful she came in our company, even if we did have such a hard time of it. We are honored that she thought enough of us to become a Mac.\" \"What is she doing now?\" Andrew asked. \"'m just as sure she is being loved and cared for as if I had her in my own home. She is old enough to make her own decisions and we must abide by them. I had a letter sometime ago, Grandpa Stuart's son is manager of the co-op out there, and Margaret is working in the store. A very good saleslady she is making, I am sure.\" \"There are a lot of good people in Utah, judging by those I am meeting every day in Resplendence.\" Hugh spoke very earnestly. \"Look what happened the day we got in from the plains. In one hour about five hundred people were taken into Salt Lake City homes and made comfortable. 'That was wonderful! Sure, Margaret is all right.\" \"If you want an example of one of the best men in the valley, take my boss,\" Andrew began. \"He told me that when I get tired, he wants me to rest till I get my weight and strength back. Sister Hunter cooks the meals that are good for us, and that isn't all, Brother Hunter has learned about Jane.\" The Macs got a good laugh from this one. \"We thought maybe he would,\" Kathleen ventured. \"Forgive me, Andrew.\" \"Oh! That's all right, Kathleen. He didn't hear it from me,\" Andrew remarked with a smile. \"No, he keeps all of his thoughts of Jane locked up in his own kind heart,\" Mother proffered. \"Well, I may have told him, at that,\" chuckled Andrew, \"but, getting back, Brother Hunter thinks working for wages is too slow. He wants me to raise wheat. I can't homestead until I'm a citizen, but he has a plan. I would like to homestead down on the river bottoms some day. They get the water out on the land so easy over there.\" Hugh voiced his hopes that some day he could raise fruit on the bench. \"The soil is a large part sand, ideal for raising fruit.\" \"That's life!\" Brother Coleman allowed. \"Andrew, with hay and grain on the bottoms; Hugh, with his peach and apple orchards on the bench.\" \"Well, we can dream, can't we, Father?\" \"Yes, my son, we build our lives on dreams. Stop dreaming, and we stop growing.\" \"Utah's a land of dreams.\" Andrew was unusually thoughtful today. \"But the best dream of all is still in Scotland, waiting for the boat,\" Bob suggested. \"Which brings us right back to QUESTING LIGHTS the Mac question number one,\" Hugh reckoned. \"How to get the young lady across the water?\" EVERY hour Mother could spare from her work she spent with Kathleen. So much time had passed by when Kathleen couldn't work because of the coming of her baby that she was very busy now. Hugh and Father Coleman had built the furniture. The rugs, curtains, and bedding Kathleen made herself. Now the little clothes were all about finished. One night in the spring Hugh came for Mother. As morning softly descended upon the peaceful village of Resplendence, Kathleen presented her husband with a beautiful baby boy. It was decided to name him Mac Coleman Shand. \"That should make him very happy all the days of his life, for to me the name is very sacred,\" Kathleen explained. \"It's what the name stands for that appeals to me—love, service, and understanding that came after days of traveling and suffering together on the plains.\" The fulfillment of dreams calls for work, hard work. Andrew was strong again. He accepted no more leniency on his job. Brother Hunter and the young man spent several days on the river bottoms looking for land where Andrew could raise wheat, and where, later, he could homestead. They found land as level as a barn floor, with hardly a rock on an acre, and with a thriving crop of good sagebrush. Brother Hunter furnished the team, equipment, and seed grain for planting. When Andrew spoke of paying him in the fall, Brother Hunter said, \"My pay will come when I see your homestead covered with growing crops, with a home, and a wife to take care of you.\" The spring work was completed, the seeds were in their soft cradles. The rains were falling to start the miracle of germination and growth. The people in the valley turned their cattle out to feed in the bottoms and on the foothills. Andrew would have to stay with the grain night and day. There were no fences. One morning, after a rainstorm, the whole field seemed suddenly to turn green. Wonders upon wonders, the crop was up! Andrew wanted to tush over to the Macs and the Hunters to tell them the great news, but he could not leave the wheat. Instead, he wrote a letter to Jane. Jane Darling, The crop is up! Oh, how I wish you were here to see it. The whole field is green. I am sure every seed has sprouted, which means that in the fall I can sell the grain and send the money for you to come to Resplendence. 'That is, and here's the rub, if I can get any money. There just isn't any in these western regions, but we will hope, Jane. The rain is falling, making this the most beautiful valley in the whole world. I have decided to build our home on the millrace, a canal that has been cut through from the canyon to furnish power for a flour mill and a factory which the people are going to build. 'I remember the singing streams in Scotland, and the paths we used to climb up the hillside towards the pits, also a very charming young lady with a heart of gold. I met her at school. I couldn't go very long, but long enough to find you, my darling. Oh! Oh! The strays are coming. I will have to get on my black pony, Gypsy, and drive them away. More tonight. I love you, Jane.\n\nAndrew (To be continued) Aunt Millenium's Deone'R Sutherland 6\n\nTHE proposition is at any rate an interesting one,\" said Papa, crossing his legs so that one thin knee jutted up balancing a green, leather-covered book and an open letter above that. \"Well,\" said Mama, \"a great-aunt is a great-aunt.\" This remark my younger brother Toby and I considered at length. Papa is usually a school teacher and is a man who has read a great many books, but who has spent very little time at the farm of his Aunt Millenium. Our great-aunt has the distinction of having Millenium for a first name. \"I'm sure it will be very simple for all of us to become acclimated to a farm, at least for a summer,\" said Papa. \"Aunt Millenium most certainly cannot stay on _ there alone.\" \"Most certainly not,\" said Mama, who is always saying she agrees with Papa about everything except those things which are practical. If she at this time thought our stay on a farm and our turning farmers out of the realm of the practical, she was undoubtedly right. \"And then Lavinia Elizabeth can live with us there and continue working on her uh whatever it is,\" said my mother, talking about my older sister. \"The Bifurcated Existence of the Elizabethans,\" supplied Toby, who is very precocious for his age. \"Yes,\" said Mama, nodding, \"she can finish it on the farm.\" I chewed on my hair. It was supposed to be cut wind-blown, but it was cut so infrequently that often the front locks, when I leaned forward, could be stretched to my mouth. Papa said it would all lead to nearsightedness in the end.\n\nRK * & BOCSVILLE, where Great-Aunt Millenium lives, gets very muddy in the spring. Papa stopped our gray Ford at the Bogsville Combination Depot and Feed Store and stepped out of the car into the mud. \"Oh my,\" said Papa, and we all looked away as we heard the suction noise of Papa pulling out his feet. \"Quite a bit of mud this time of year,\" called Papa to a man leaning in the doorway of the depot. \"Some,\" said the man. \"We're wondering if we can get through to it's the place Aunt -... Papa's voice faded away in the distance. \"The man does not seem very friendly,\" I observed to Mama, as Papa made inquiries. \"It would be nicer if there were more trees,\"' said Lavinia Elizabeth, leaning toward the Sunny car window and squinting through her glasses while holding her place in her book with one hand. \"Well, of course,\" said Toby, \"the deciduous trees have not fully leafed as yet.\" \"No, they haven't, have they, as yet?\" agreed Mama brightly. We could tell she was trying to keep up our spirits. Mama can be very courageous.\n\nLavinia Elizabeth looked at Toby, and then she picked up her book AUNT MILLENIUM's again. 541 Just then Papa came slush-ing back to the car.\n\"Did you get muddy?\" asked Toby. Mama frowned at Toby.\n\"Oh, it was nothing, really,\" Papa tried furtively to scrape his shoes on the running-board. We pretended not to notice. Papa looked very apologetic. He was being very humble because he was feeling guilty. Toby and I knew. He had, at the last minute, taken out two of his white shirts and replaced them with a volume of Restoration Plays, even though boxes of his books were coming by express. The only time Mama had ever really got angry about Papa's peculiar way of packing was the time he had substituted three volumes of Victorian poetry for Mama's two nightgowns and best blue serge.\n\n\"So this is Bogsville,\" said Mama.\nLavinia Elizabeth looked up from her book. \"At any rate,\" she said, \"I'll be quite isolated enough to finish my part of the book. I'll be able to concentrate.\"\n\nGREAT-Aunt Millenium came out on her back porch to meet us. Our car slued and then mired itself at the end of her boardwalk. We got out of the car and started carrying in our things to Aunt Millenium's house.\n\nPapa left his shoes by the scraper and walked around in his stocking feet. We had the three bedrooms upstairs. Lavinia Elizabeth and I were to share a room.\n\"This will be rather inconvenient,\" said Lavinia Elizabeth.\n\"You'll have to learn to be neat,\" said Mama to me.\nI did not say anything. Lavinia is very smart, and I am very shy and uncouraegous around very smart people—especially my sister who is collaborating on a book with two men, a graduate student like herself, and a college teacher.\n\n\"How old are you?\" said Great-Aunt Millenium to Lavinia Elizabeth.\n\"I'm only twenty-five,\" said my sister. Everyone said it was quite wonderful of Lavinia Elizabeth to be only twenty-five and to have done so much.\n\"Twenty-five and nothing but a book to your credit! What's he like, the one who's a graduate student, Lavinia Elizabeth?\" asked Great-Aunt Millenium.\n\"He is brilliant,\" answered my sister, \"and he thinks I have a good mind.\" Lavinia looked down at her feet. Her glasses slid forward on her nose.\n\n\"My word,\" said Great-Aunt Millenium, \"is that all? It must be the way you do your hair. I've got a magazine that tells you if you want an uplift—Don't you ever notice what's in that kind of magazines?\"\n\"I never read that kind of literature,\" replied Lavinia Elizabeth, pushing up her glasses.\n\n\"My word!\" said Aunt Millenium. Papa coughed very loudly, and Mama began to ask about dinner. Toby and I stared at Great-Aunt Millenium.\n\"You can go fishing here, if you go after your own worms,\" Great-Aunt Millenium said to Toby.\n\"Oh,\" said Toby, \"I don't think I'd care for worms.\"\n\"That's something Toby's never had the opportunity to do,\" said Papa. \"My word!\" Millenium. Said Great-Aunt\n\nTHE next morning we got up very early. All of us except Lavinia Elizabeth were to help on the farm, and even she was to help when we needed her. Great-Aunt Millenium had a hired hand for whom, later in the summer, she said she was extremely grateful. Papa had ordered winter wheat for Great-Aunt Millenium before we came, and then he and Mama had picked up one or two other things from which they expected to make a lot of money. All in all, it was to be a very growing summer.\n\nGreat-Aunt Millenium's hired hand waited in the kitchen for Papa. \"This is Jake,\" said Great Aunt Millenium to Papa. Jake grunted slightly. \"How do you do,\" said Papa. Toby and I looked at each other. Papa did not look very much like a farmer. Jake did not seem to be too impressed, either. They were going to do something to fence posts, Jake said. Papa followed Jake. We hoped it wouldn't take Papa too long to get acclimated. Toby and I went outside. We stopped by some bright yellow crocuses. 'They bloomed down at the end of the yard. Beyond them a clay wash stretched downhill, yellow and muddy. We looked at the crocuses. Great-Aunt Millenium stood behind us.\n\nShe smiled and Toby let her put her hand on his head. The sun was bright. It was a good summer, we decided. Mama said she would help also. She would help with the farming.\n\n\"The farm animals?\" asked Great Aunt Millenium.\n\"Well, perhaps not the big farm animals,\" said Mama hesitantly.\n\"The chickens,\" decided Aunt Millenium.\nToby and I were to feed them and Mama was to collect the eggs. Mama was very enthusiastic.\n\nAfter we fed them that afternoon, Mama went in with her basket. In a little while we heard Mama say, \"Shoo,\" very fiercely and then again, \"Shoo.\" Then the door opened and Mama came out of the hen coop. She went down to the shed where Jake kept the tools for the farm. In a moment she came out with the bee veiling and long leather gloves that Jake used when disturbing the bees.\n\n\"The chickens refuse to get off the nests,\" she said to Lavinia Elizabeth and me. She adjusted the long, four-sided veiling and pulled down the veils.\n\nWhen Papa saw Mama in her egg gathering costume, he stopped and opened his mouth and then closed it.\n\n\"IT am having a little trouble getting acclimated to the chickens,\" said Mama in a slightly defensive, but slightly bitter tone. She set down the evening bucket of eggs and peered through the thick veiling at Papa.\n\"It's the chickens  they cluck at me....\"\n\nPapa said he thought her new green hat with the net and spangles would be as effective in the long run, but Mama continued using the bee veiling and leather gloves.\n\nPapa's books came, but Papa had very little time to look at them. He brought down a bookcase from the attic and put it up, filled with his books, in Great-Aunt Millenium's parlor. He would run his hands along the backs of the books and then go to sleep.\n\"It is amazing how much sleep I wish I had more of,\" said Papa.\n\nPapa's seeds and other orders came. He had a surprise for Great Aunt Millenium.\n\"It's peanuts,\" said Papa.\n\"We'll plow up that empty pasture and plant peanuts.\"\nPapa's aunt stared at him.\n\"Then she said, \"Well, Henry, I doubt if this is exactly the climate for peanuts.\" \n\"It'll be all right if we have a late fall,\" said Papa. He was very eager.\n\nGreat-Aunt Millenium didn't say very much after that, but Jake would not co-operate.\n\"I don't want to have nothin' to do with it,\" said Jake.\nSo Papa spent a great deal of time planting his peanuts all by himself. Toby and I would go out and watch him sometimes. This work made him even more tired, he said.\n\nMama said, \"Well, you can always plant another pasture.\"\nJake would only look very glum. He looked very glum most of the summer.\n\"I�m worried about Lavinia Elizabeth,\" said Great-Aunt Millenium.\n\"She don't get out enough.\"\n\nWHEN the first crop of hay came on, we all went out on the wagons.\n\"But I don't have anything to wear,\" said Lavinia Elizabeth,\n\"besides\"\n\"You're way ahead of schedule,\" said Mama.\n\"Besides Aunt Millenium thinks you're too pale.\"\nShe wore Jake's overalls with a belt around the middle\n\"'to hold her in 'em,\" as Great-Aunt Millenium 543 said.\n\nToby drove the wagon, and Lavinia Elizabeth and I tramped and settled the hay.\n\"Stack it!\" Jake would yell, and Lavinia and I would run about on top the hay.\n\"I�m never sure exactly just what we're supposed to be doing,\" Lavina confided to me.\nI felt very close and friendly toward her. We both worked very hard, but not as hard as Papa, who had a difficult time landing the piles of hay on the wagon.\n\nToby got along fine with the horses after he gave up saying \"halt\" to them and consented to yell \"whoa!\" Then one hot afternoon we came riding into the yard on the top of a load of hay and noticed a strange car in the backyard. Great-Aunt Millenium and Mama were in the backyard talking to a man.\n\"It's Andrew Nichols,\" said Lavina Elizabeth, and she lay flat on the hay.\n\"Cover me up,\" she said. It was a collaborator on her book, the younger one. I had seen him at home once or twice.\n\n\"Where's Lavinia Elizabeth?\" yelled Great-Aunt Millenium.\nJake stopped the team.\n\"Here!\" Lavinia Elizabeth stood up in the hay. She picked at the hay leaves in her hair.\n\"How do you do again,\" called Andrew from down below. He looked very surprised.\n\"Can I help you get down?\"\nLavinia Elizabeth lay on her back on the hay and Papa and I held her arms as she slid.\nAndrew caught her.\n\"Thank you, Andrew,\" said Lavinia Elizabeth with great dignity. She shook out her hair. She looked very small in Jake's big overalls with the belt around the middle. She did not look the way she usually seemed to look�not at all.\n\n\"I came back about the book�I wanted to go over some things . . . .\" Andrew looked a little vague.\n\"And he came to see you,\" Aunt Millenium spoke heartily.\nAndrew and, \"yes,\" then he said \"yes\" again in a different way, and looked very pleased.\n\"Oh!\" said Lavinia Elizabeth and she put on her glasses and stared at him.\n\nJake started the horses, and we went to the barn to unload.\n\nAndrew shared Toby's room. He and Lavinia Elizabeth worked very hard on the book.\n\"About the chaos of the Copernican age . . .\" began Lavinia Elizabeth.\n\"You look very different with a sun-tan,\" interrupted Andrew.\n\nThey had put a table on the back porch and were working there.\n\"I'm very pleased about the book,\" said Great-Aunt Millenium.\n\nAfter supper one night, Great-Aunt Millenium came up to our room. \"I'll help you with your hair,\" she said to Lavinia. Lavinia Elizabeth looked very young in her nightgown, sitting on her bare feet.\n\"How is your book progressing?\"\n\"Well,\" said Lavinia Elizabeth, \"the book . . . well, the book is fine, I guess.\" Then she got up and kissed Great-Aunt Millenium on the cheek. \"I don't know exactly what's progressing,\" she said and her cheeks looked very red.\n\nWELL,\n\"There should be more box-elders than this with those peanuts,\" said Papa.\nHe had turned very brown in the sun also.\n\"It beats me,\" he said.\n\n\"Say,\" said Papa to Aunt Millenium, \"is Jake always this taciturn?\"\n\"Well, he don't talk more than most of the people here.\"\n\"You know,\" said Andrew, \"the first Sunday we went to church after I arrived, the bishop said this town was more like New England than any place in the West. The people are lovable only after you know them.\"\n\"I believe it,\" said Papa, \"at any rate, the put about New England.\" He yawned.\n\"If I'm not hungry, I'm sleepy.\"\n\nThey'll never know me this fall back at school.\"\n\"Well, none of us are very pale any more,\" said Mama, through her mask of cold cream which she seemed to wear a great deal of the time. \"I'd wear this in the coop, but the effect might be fatal,\" she said.\nAndrew and Lavinia Elizabeth went out for walks often after dinner. One evening they came into the house and into the parlor where we were all sitting.\n\"We've been out for some fresh air, Elizabeth and I,\" said Andrew.\n\"There is certainly a lot of fresh air outside,\" he added heartily.\nLavinia Elizabeth and Andrew went to find it more and more difficult to make conversation with us,\" remarked Papa.\nGreat-Aunt Millenium smiled while she tatted. She rubbed her cat with her foot. \"It'll be different after he ask you for her,\" said Great-Aunt Millenium.\n\"Oh,\" I said looking up, \"is it a kind of a secret now?\" AUNT MILLENIUM'S I had been reading a great many of Great-Aunt Millenium's hidden novels. \"Oh,\" I repeated. \"Oh!\" said Papa. Mama smiled at Aunt Millenium through her cold cream. Toby yawned. The summer was nearly over, and we all decided the peanut crop was a failure, even though Papa had had a triumphant afternoon when the plants had really sprouted. The only trouble was the peanuts at the other end had failed to materialize as they did in the picture. \"Not enough time, I guess,\" said Papa moodily. He had had to take a great many comments from the townspeople who frequently stopped to inspect his peanut crop. The book was finished, yet Andrew kept hanging around. \"He's getting up the courage,\" said Great-Aunt Millenium. \"Well, I wish he'd hurry,\" said Papa, \"the whole thing makes me very nervous.\" Lavinia Elizabeth would sit before our mirror after we were supposed to be in bed. She would take off her glasses and Jean forward, and then she would smile at herself. It was late August when Andrew and Papa went walking up to see the failed peanut crop. When they came back, we knew it was over, and Great-Aunt Millenium cooked a big special dinner in honor of Andrew and Lavinia Elizabeth. It was all very romantic. I did not even mind the chance drops of water slipping down my face from my curls, I was so interested in watching them. Lavinia Elizabeth smiled at Andrew and he smiled at her. I felt a lump in my throat when Lavinia Elizabeth would be so lovely just with smiling at Andrew. Papa smiled at Mama and Great-Aunt Millenium. \"Well, we made a mistake or two,\" said Papa.\n\"Never mind,\" said Mama. Papa leaned back in his chair. \"But nothing that can't be repaired by a good extra hired man next summer,\" he said. \"Well, we'll certainly plow up the peanuts you planted half the country with,\" said Aunt Millenium drily, \"and those sweet peas Maude filled my vegetable garden with.\" \"Oh my,\" said Mama, laughing. \"I did make a mistake there, but they were so pretty....\" \"Yes,\" said Aunt Millenium, \"but as pretty as sweet peas are, I'm afraid the peas you can eat and put in cans are more sensible.\" Andrew laughed, but he was not looking at us. He looked only at Lavinia Elizabeth. Toby and I went outside after Great-Aunt Millenium's supper. Toby went to the garage and came out with a bucket and a flashlight. \"What are you doing?\" I asked him. I felt bad about the summer being nearly over. Two more days.... \"Tm thinking about going fishing tomorrow. I'm thinking about trapping some night-crawlers.\" \"Oh,\" I said. I watched him from the porch. In a few minutes Lavinia Elizabeth and Andrew crossed the lawn and leaned on the gate opening into the orchard. Andrew held her hand. \"Look!\" I whispered to Toby. \"Abominably biological,\" he said, squinting with his nose very close to the ground. \"Grand passion,\" I breathed fervently; then sadly I felt for one of my longer, slipping curls with my tongue.\nMargaret C.

    "content": "The Art of Beautiful Tone Quality in Singing\nFlorence Jepperson Madsen Member, Relief Society General Board\n\nSing again, with your clear voice revealing a tone  \nOf some world far from ours,  \nWhere music and moonlight and feeling are one. (Shelley)\n\nA tone is a given, fixed sound of certain, definite pitch. It is refined sound and is composed of a fundamental tone and its overtones. It is the heart of all music. If tones are complete in every respect the music will be correspondingly good. Certain characteristic elements are present in a beautiful tone. Of these richness is one of the most basic and appealing. To produce this quality there must be a definite, clear-cut, fundamental tone. Above this there must also be a certain number of partials (overtones) evenly distributed. It is the presence of these overtones in their proper inherency and proportion that finally determines the tone quality (timbre or timber). This quality denotes a particular characteristic type of tone such as: sonorous, rich, beautiful.\n\nThe ability to think, produce, and fully appreciate beautiful tone quality is a gift—an inherited capacity, the ability to perceive and conceive vibratory completeness, perfection, beauty. In fact, a person who is a real artist belongs to the rank of a genius. Nevertheless, much of this gift may be acquired through diligent study, listening, imitating, reasoning, ear-training, association, comparing, producing, correcting, improving. Since not all of us are especially endowed with tonal understanding, and since beautiful tone quality is indispensable to proper singing, and since most of us love to sing as well as we can, it is reasonable to conclude that we should strive to acquire as much understanding of beautiful tone quality as possible.\nPersistent Study Necessary\nWhat is the end of study? Let me know? Why, that to know, which else we should not know. Things are not good, you mean, from common sense? Ay, but is study's god-like recompense. (Shakespeare)\nStudy tone quality from every possible single and authoritative point. This includes: (a) Consonance, agreeable in sound, not scattered, \"throaty,\" uneven tone, but, concentrated, unrestrictied, resonant. (b) Pitch, a certain number of vibrations per second, unwavering, sustained. This is accomplished by singing long tones on different pitches, with proper and sustained breath support, as explained in lesson one. Practice with thoughts, feelings, and emotions directed towards the beautiful in life and nature. This conduces to richness and beauty of tone quality.\n[Note: The short articles on music which appear in the Magazine may form the basis for the discussion in the choristers' and organists' department of union meeting.] Page 552\nTheology—The Life and Ministry of the Savior\nLesson 10—\"As One Having Authority\"\nElder Don B. Colton\n(Reference: Jesus the Christ, Chapter 18, by Elder James E. Talmage)\nFor Tuesday, November 2, 1948\nObjective: To offer proof that Jesus the Lord possessed the fulness of divine power and authority.\nNote: All quotations which are not followed by references are taken from the text Jesus the Christ.\nJESUS laid no claim to human authorization. Whether in private or public utterance he made no effort to establish any call from earthly powers or governments. He was to do his Father's work and so asserted from the beginning. He exercised power over the forces of nature, men, demons, and even over life and death. He affirmed that power had been given him \"over all flesh\" (John 17:2). \"For it pleased the Father that in him [Christ] should all fulness dwell\" (Col. 1:19).\nHow wisely and beneficially he used that power will be pointed out in this lesson. \"For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes\" (Mark 7:29).\nThe Centurion's Servant Healed\nAt the time Jesus delivered the Sermon on the Mount, Capernaum, where he spent much time, was governed by the Romans. Attached to the household of a centurion, a Roman captain, was a highly esteemed servant who was ill \"and ready to die.\" The centurion had great faith in Christ and earnestly entreated the Jewish elders to implore the Lord to save the sick servant.\nThe centurion did not ask for a personal visit but only that the Savior would speak the effective word. The Lord did that and the servant, though not present, was healed. Jesus remarked afterward: \". . . I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel\" (Matt 8:10). This was said of a Gentile and was a surprise to the Jews. It was plainly meant to convey the truth that Gentiles would be preferred in the kingdom of God if they were more worthy.\nA Young Man of Nain Raised from the Dead\nFollowing the miracle just described, Jesus went to the small town of Nain. As he approached the town, he and his followers met a funeral cortege of a widow's only son. From a Painting by Hofmann MARY ANOINTING THE FEET OF JESUS A Perry Picture LESSON DEPARTMENT The sorrow of the bereft and lonely mother touched the Savior and he bade her in gentle tones, \"Weep not.\" Then, speaking to the corpse, he said, \"Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.\" 'The Lord of all, both the living and the dead, had spoken. The young man arose, restored to life, and was graciously given back to his mother. The people who saw, \"... Glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people\" (Luke 7:1-16). Parenthetically, it may be of interest to know that Luke was a physician. All of the miracles relating to healing described in the New Testament are described by Luke. Each of the other three writers tells of some of these miracles but Luke writes of them all. Human problems appealed to him; and he gives a very good account of the parable of the Good Samaritan.\nJohn the Baptist\nAbout the time Jesus commenced his active ministry, John the Baptist had been imprisoned by order of Herod Antipas, tetrarch of Galilee and Perea. A feeling of sympathy for John naturally comes to us. He had been so fearless and effective as the forerunner of the Messiah. The 'Baptist had rebuked Herod the tetrarch for living with Herodias, the undivorced wife of the tetrarch's brother, even though they had gone through an illegal marriage ceremony. The wicked woman had a \"quarrel against him,\" [John] and had succeeded in having him imprisoned. After many months of imprisonment, John, who had heard so much 555 of the Savior's word, sent two messengers to him inquiring, \"Art thou he that should come? Or look we for another?\" After healing many people of their infirmities and of evil spirits and restoring sight to the blind, Jesus said to these messengers:... Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached. And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me (Luke 7:22-23). John, no doubt, was familiar with the prophecies of Isaiah concerning the works the Messiah would do and was comforted with the report of the messengers. (Read Isaiah 35: -6.) There are good grounds for believing that John's purpose in sending the disciples to make the inquiry was largely designed to confirm in those disciples an abiding faith in the Christ. He himself had been given a testimony at the time of the Savior's baptism. The Savior commented further regarding John and his great work, after the messengers had gone back. He wanted the people to appreciate the Baptist and called their attention to his one-time popularity. It was not the Master's plan to build himself up by discrediting others.\n\nJohn had been fearless and forceful in proclaiming the nearness of the establishment of the kingdom of God and the coming of the Redeemer: The Lord stated: \"For I say unto you, among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist; but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he\" (Luke 7:28). For an interesting explanation of the first part of the quotation just made see Documentary History of the Church under date of May 24, 1843 (Jesus the Christ, page 275). The latter part of the quotation has given rise to much discussion and comment. The most commonly accepted explanation is that John had not learned the full purpose and meaning of the mission; that he had seen the witness of the Holy Ghost, but probably had not received the full light of the testimony as to who Jesus was, and had been unable to comprehend the truth concerning the death and resurrection of the Lord. To know that in its fulness, and also to know the Father, is eternal life (Read John 17:3). To be in the kingdom of heaven one must know God lives.\n\n. . . Jesus in no wise intimated that John would remain less than the best in the kingdom, but, on the contrary, that a knowledge of the vital truths of the kingdom, and rendered obedience thereto, he would surely advance and become great in the kingdom of heaven as he was great among the prophets of earth (Jesus the Christ, page 278).\n\nJesus fully appreciated John the Baptist and compared their lives. The wicked Jews had rejected the latter partly because he was very strict—as strict as any Nazarite. He refused to join merrymakers or indulge in any of the common pleasures of the day. But when the Savior came without austerity, eating and drinking as a normal, righteous man would do, they complained: \"Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!\"\n\nHow sinners do seek an excuse to justify their actions in disregarding God's commands!\n\nWe need not here relate the ghastly account of the death of John the Baptist nor the wickedness of the woman who caused him to be put to death. In the sixth chapter of Mark, the dreadful story is told.\n\nWe have in this day a glorious testimony that John lives again, a resurrected being. He is great in the kingdom of heaven. In May 1829, he laid his hands upon the heads of Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and ordained them to the Priesthood of Aaron (D&C, sec. 13).\n\nIn the House of Simon the Pharisee\n\nThe Lord used Simon, a Pharisee, to teach one of his great lessons. This man had invited the Savior to dine at his home. Luke gives a good description of the event. It was the custom in those days for the host to greet distinguished guests with a kiss of welcome, to see that water was provided for washing the feet, and oil for anointing the hair. All of these courtesies were omitted by Simon and the reception seems to have been a cool one. The guests undoubtedly reclined on couches or divans, as was the custom in those days, with their feet outward from the table.\n\nWhile the meal was in progress, a humble, penitent woman, who had been unvirtuous, entered the home and approached Jesus from the back. She had no doubt heard his gracious words and wanted forgiveness. She bathed the feet of Jesus with her tears and wiped his feet with her hair.\n\nSimon watched her and said to himself: \"This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.\" Jesus read his thoughts and told him of the creditor who forgave his two debtors, the one 500 pence and the other fifty. Jesus asked, \"Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?\" The answer from Simon could only be, \"I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most.\" Jesus continued:\n\n\"Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet. My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.\"\n\nJesus turned to the woman and said, \"Thy sins are forgiven . . . Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace\" (Luke 7:36-50).\n\nSome writers have confused this woman just mentioned with Mary, the sister of Martha and Lazarus, others with Mary Magdalene. There is no justification for either conclusion. There are no grounds for believing that either of these fine women was ever unchaste.\n\nChrist's Authority Ascribed to Beelzebub\n\nThere were wicked men, particularly among the Pharisees, who evolved the theory that Jesus performed his great miracles through the power of Satan. This ridiculous suggestion was rebuffed by the argument that the devil would not overthrow his own followers; that a kingdom divided against itself could not stand but must suffer disruption. While the Lord had not sought publicity, it was well known that he had cast out devils, performed many mighty miracles, and possessed powers unknown to any other being who had ever lived upon the earth.\n\nSeekers After Signs\n\nNotwithstanding all that had been done in their midst, people came frequently to the Lord with the request, \"Master, we would see a sign from thee.\" To such he gave the scathing reply, \"An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign, and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas.\" As Jonas [Jonah] was three days in the belly of the fish and then released; so would the Son of Man be in the tomb for three days and then he would rise again.\n\nSurely no one who believes can read of these wonderful events without feeling that Jesus possessed the fulness of divine power and exercised that power in righteousness. \"But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it\" (Luke 11:28).\n\nQuestions and Suggestions for Discussion\n\n1. From what source did Jesus derive his authority?\n2. Relate the circumstances of the raising of the son of the widow of Nain.\n3. Tell briefly the story of John the Baptist and relate events in his life which show he was a great man.\n4. Describe the events which took place in the house of Simon the Pharisee. Why did the Savior say, \"Thy faith hath saved thee, go in peace\"?\n Visiting Teachers' Messages Our Savior Speaks Lesson 2 \"Where Are the Nine?\" Elder H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, November 2, 1948 Objective: To warn against the sin of ingratitude.\n\nAnd it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off: And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us. And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed. And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God, and fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan. And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? But where are the nine? There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger (Luke 17:11-18). \"And he was a Samaritan.\" It is significant in the parable quoted that the one leper to return and glorify God was \"a stranger,\" one who knew not the \"law\" as Israel. We may be led to believe that the other nine belonged to the faith, a fact which in itself may or may not add to the lesson. It does remain that the majority of those healed forgot all sense of gratitude in the personal joy of their deliverance. What is it that the Lord would require of them who would show gratitude to him? First and foremost he has said to exhibit love—love which above all is unselfish and remembers blessings bestowed. In a world today which places such emphasis on material values, we are apt to take for granted many blessings which money cannot buy. How can we in the Church be not like the \"nine\" in the things the Lord would have us remember? Perhaps we can best show our appreciation by recognizing often the less obvious daily blessings the Church affords. Let us think a deacon knocks at the door to ask for fast offerings, a chorister stimulates to loftier thoughts during song practice, a teacher invites active thinking of gospel truths, an elder comes to lay hands on a dear one who suffers pain, and two Relief Society visiting teachers call at a home in a spirit of love. For these and many other sweet services the Lord would have us grateful, for they come as do all his gifts without money and without price. Mothers in the home have a great responsibility to teach their children to express gratitude: first, through prayer to the Lord and thanks for all they have; then, gratitude to parents, brothers, sisters, relatives and associates for their unselfish acts of love and service. Any child who, from youth, is thus taught, will not be found among the nine. \"Where are the nine?\" (Luke 17:11-18).\n559\n\nWork Meeting Sewing\n(A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting)\n\nLesson 2 Remodeling Dresses\nJean Ridges Jennings\n\nFor Tuesday, November 9, 1948\n\nWhat are we going to do with the old dresses that are either out of style or worn out in some places so that they can no longer be used as they are, but are too good to throw away? In this lesson we want to consider the possibilities for remodeling them so they can be worn by the original wearer. Often it is quite easy to get more wear out of an old garment by buying some new material and combining it with the old and getting a very satisfactory result. However, in too many cases the new material has a tendency to increase the shabbiness of the old by contrast and the extra cost involved is not warranted. The obvious conclusion is that it would be much better to choose the fabric from another outmoded garment rather than add new to the old. In this way we have one new dress for two old ones.\n\nThere are various possible combinations in this method of fashioning a new dress. One could combine a print with a plain material that either blended or contrasted satisfactorily with it. Or a silk dress might be used with one of wool that was harmonious. Still another possibility is that of combining fabrics of the same color but contrasting texture such as satin and crepe; faille and light weight wool; or velveteen with wool. The style chosen to make over the garments would naturally have to depend on the lines in the original garment. One would need to choose a pattern that could be adapted to the lines of the old dresses.\n\nHere are some possible suggestions: In case the old dress is no longer usable because the sleeves have pulled out at the seams, or worn out under the arms or at the elbows, try making new sleeves with a large deep armhole out of the other old dress. Have them shaped in such a way that they can be set back as far or as low as necessary to eliminate the worn places. A contrasting yoke can be set in the waist of an old dress to perk it up. Or an entire new front can be made for the blouse part of the dress. And to carry the contrasting color elsewhere, the skirt could be lengthened with bands of the same material as the blouse front or yoke. One could have the entire skirt of one material and the blouse entirely of another with the exception of a collar, tie or some other trimming to carry the skirt color up and thus unify the costume.\n\nAt the present time in many cases good dresses will be out of active service because they are too short. To bring them back to high style one might add a contrasting peplum  under which the skirt could be dropped by adding a yoke and thus give it the required length. The material from which the peplum is made could be used for collar and cuffs, or neck bow, or buttons, thus carrying it into the blouse. This treatment is particularly attractive in the case of material of the same color but contrasting texture.\n\nOften by hunting in pattern books for styles that show contrasting materials some very helpful ideas can be found.\n\nLiterature\nLiterature of the Latter-day Saints\nLiterature of the Gospel Restoration\n\nLesson 2—Highlights of the Book of Mormon\nEpic Elder Howard R. Driggs\n\nFor Tuesday, November 16, 1948\n\nThe following excerpt from the Autobiography of Parley P. Piatt offers an excellent literary introduction to our lesson. Parley, on a mission for the \"Campbellites,\" had neared Palmyra and made arrangements to hold a meeting. He writes: We visited an old Baptist deacon by the name of Hamlin. After hearing of our appointment for evening, he began to tell of a book, A STRANGE BOOK, a VERY STRANGE BOOK! in his possession, which had just been published. This book, he said, purported to have been originally written on plates either of gold or brass, by a branch of the tribes of Israel!\n\nand to have been discovered and translated by a young man near Palmyra, in the State of New York, by the aid of visions or the ministering of angels. I inquired of him how or where the book was to be obtained. He promised me the perusal of it at his house the next day if I would call. I felt a strange interest in the book .... Next morning I called at his house, where for the first time my eyes beheld the BOOK OF MORMON, that book of books, that record which reveals the antiquities of the New World back to the remotest ages and which unfolds the destiny of its people and the world for all time to come, that Book which contains the fulness of the gospel of a crucified and risen Redeemer, that Book which reveals a lost remnant of Joseph, and which was the principal means, in the hands of God, of directing the entire course of my future life. I opened it with eagerness, and read its title page. I then read the testimony of several witnesses in relation to the manner of its being found and translated. After this I commenced its contents by course. I read all day; eating was a burden. I had no desire for food; sleep was a burden when the night came, for I preferred reading to sleep. As I read, the spirit of the Lord was upon me, and I knew and comprehended that the book was true as plainly and manifestly as a man comprehends and knows that he exists. My joy was now full, as it were, and I rejoiced sufficiently to more than pay me for all the sorrows, sacrifices and toils of my life. I soon determined to see the young man who had been the instrument to its discovery and translation (Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt, chapter V). What is there in this \"book of books\" so to intrigue a man of such outstanding intelligence as we know Parley P. Pratt possessed? What is in this scripture that charms and holds readers of open mind and heart whatever their station in life? First of all, it would seem to be the epic story of the Book of Mormon itself. An epic, we should explain, is a composite story—a series of stories, if you will, that portrays a people. And such indeed is the epic of the Book of Mormon. Secondly, the simple yet profound portrayal of the gospel. Stories woven into the Book of Mormon epic are of distinctive quality. Like those in the Old and New Testament they have not only intriguing interest but inner meaning—deep spiritual import. They live and last in the souls of those who appreciate them. Let us consider here a few of these stories, from a literary viewpoint as well as from the messages of truth they vitalize. A first of these, which challenged the writer's intense interest even in boyhood, is one which might be entitled: \"A Heroic Youth Serves His People.\" This story, which is told in full, I Nephi, chapters 3 and 4, has all the qualities of a classic. It presents a vital problem—the procuring of a sacred, saving record. It portrays a clash of negative and positive spirits, represented in the brothers Laman and Nephi. It moves with precision and rising interest. Difficulties and danger enhance the drama. Crises are met with heroism, and success achieved. The plates of brass, containing scripture beyond price for the adventures in a new world, are delivered to the prophet-leader, Lehi. Within this dramatic story there is also something deeper than a mere tale for entertainment. First of all, it impresses unforgettably the vital, saving value of the written word of God for any people. Secondly, it lifts into the clear, precious truths. Two of these stand out:...\n\nThe Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them (I Nephi 3:7). It is better that one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief (1 Nephi 4:13). Through other stirring narrative, given as the epic naturally develops, the meaningful events are portrayed. With the sacred record on the brass plates, which contained much of what we know as the Old Testament, including the vital prophecies of Isaiah, to guide and inspire them, the band under their living prophet Lehi fared forth into the unknown. It was a new journey into the wilderness and across the wide waters to a new \"Land of Promise.\" Note the beauty of Lehi's counsel to his sons, Laman and Lemuel: And when my father saw that the waters of the river emptied into the fountain of the Red Sea, he spake unto Laman, saying: O that thou mightest be like unto this river, continually running into the fountain of all righteousness! And he also spake unto Lemuel: O that thou mightest be like unto this valley, firm and steadfast, and immovable in keeping the commandments of the Lord! (I Nephi 2:9-10). \n\nAnd the great adventure was filled, as was that of the other children of Israel, with drama. Misgivings and even conflict within the families add to natural difficulties (I Nephi, chaps. 2-7). At times the Lord must use reproof and sharp correction to keep rebellious spirits such as Laman and Lemuel from thwarting the divine purpose which is being unfolded under the courageous leadership of Lehi and his loyal son Nephi. This is the central purpose of the Book of Mormon epic: to impress the truth that our Savior lives. All its stories, the doctrines they carry— all its quotations from Isaiah, who clearly visioned the Messiah, bear directly or indirectly on this divine message to mankind. To keep this clearly in mind will help those who follow this lesson, and who may continue to study the epic, better to understand the great composite story.\n\nAnother thing of import; and this is plainly stated by Nephi: Emphasis is laid in this scripture on \"the things of God.\" Says this prophet: Wherefore, the things which are pleasing unto the world I do not write, but the things which are pleasing unto God, and unto those who are not of the world. Wherefore, I shall give commandment unto my seed, that they shall not occupy these plates with things which are not of worth unto the children of men (I Nephi 6:5-6).\n\nLiterary \"smart\" folk have often spoken flippantly about the Book of Mormon as dull reading. Even some of our own people more now than ever before, accustomed to swiftly moving, sensational fiction and drama at times confess they find it uninteresting. All of which is to say they are looking for something different from what this scriptural epic contains. Its stories are of a distinctive type. They are laden with truths of priceless value, with discourses on deeply religious themes.\n\nIn the Old Testament and the New Testament, the prophetic writings and the epistles are, in the main, set apart. In the Book of Mormon such expository writings are woven into the stories that serve to vitalize and impress the teachings. Is this not good psychology? Certainly the Master followed the same plan in making his lessons live. They are inwoven with the incidents and stories which give them not only clarity but concreteness.\n\nA rather close parallel in the New Testament to the Book of Mormon epic structure may be found in \"The Acts of the Apostles.\" This likeness is shown, for example, in the story of the prophet Abinadi (See Mosiah chapters 11 to 17 inclusive). Here is a stirring account of a heroic man of God who, like Peter and Paul, carried the word of the Lord to the unbelieving and wicked, even though in the end it meant martyrdom. Abinadi, with the courage of Elijah before King Ahab, beards perverted King Noah and his apostate priests in the throne room of the erring monarch, and delivers his message of truth and light. He finally dies a martyr's death, yet not in vain. Abinadi's testimony goes to the heart and soul of one of the priests, Alma. And this heroic man after the prophet's cruel death, carries on through testing difficulties and dangers the work of God.\n\nFor the story of Abinadi itself, the class leader might sketch through the chapters named above. In chapter 11 we get the full setting. Chapter 12 carries forward the epic, giving in verses 1 to 8, God's prophetic warning to the evil-doers. Then comes the angry report of the priests to their king Abinadi's cross-examination before Noah and this LESSON DEPARTMENT prophet's searching questions to the perverted priests. There is a rush to slay the courageous leader but he withstands the onslaught, saying: Touch me not, for God shall smite you if ye lay your hands upon me, for I have not delivered the message which the Lord sent me to deliver; neither have I told you that which ye requested that I should tell; therefore God will not suffer that I shall be destroyed at this time (Mosiah 13:3). Then to the maddened but cowed listeners he delivers boldly his words from God. The Ten Commandments are reimpressed. The priests and their king are chided for not teaching even these fundamentals. And saying that this is not enough \"salvation doth not come by the law of Moses alone\" (Mosiah 13:28), Abinadi portrays the vision of the Messiah to come, recalls the prophecies of Isaiah, and pictures with clarity the fulfillment of those inspired words through the coming of the Son of God the Savior and Redeemer of the world. To King Noah and his wicked priests all save Alma, such words are just heresy.\n\nAbinadi, his courageous message delivered, is seized and imprisoned. Then he is given a chance to save himself by denying his testimony; but he will not. The king, fearful of the words of the prophet, would have released him, but the condemned priests will not have it so. Abinadi is seized, bound to a stake and the fire set. Yet even out of the flames he prophesies: Behold, even as ye have done unto me, so shall it come to pass that thy seed shall cause that many shall suffer even the pains of death by fire; and this because they believe in the salvation of the Lord their God.\n\n563 And it will come to pass that ye shall be afflicted with all manner of diseases because of your iniquities, Yea, and ye shall be smitten on every hand, and shall be driven and scattered to and fro, even as a wild flock is driven by wild and ferocious beasts. And in that day ye shall be hunted, and ye shall be taken by the hand of your enemies, and then ye shall suffer, as I suffer, the pains of death by fire.\n\nThus God executeth vengeance upon those who destroy his people. O God, receive my soul (Mosiah 17:15-19). Here in the story of Abinadi is drama of high quality impressing divine truth. 'The words of this dauntless prophet were fulfilled. And he did not die in vain for his great work was carried on by another heroic soul whom he inspired. Within the Book of Mormon epic are many like dramatic stories, impressing eternal principles of the gospel. A sequence of such stories is portrayed: the masterful work of Alma the elder in establishing the Church of Christ (Mosiah, chaps. 23, 24, 25); the fate of wicked King Noah (Mosiah, chapter 19); the impressive conversion of Alma's erring son, Alma, and the sons of King Mosiah to the gospel, and their courageous missionary work (Mosiah, 27-29). This second Alma, or Alma the younger, in the book of the same name, carries forward the epic. It is replete with stories, with truths of life made plain and concrete, and with stirring drama. Deeply impressive and moving is the part where Alma, Chief Judge and High Priest of his people, counsels his sons, Helaman, Shiblon, and Corianton (Alma, chaps. 36-42). Recounting his own wayward youth, his miraculous conversion (Mosiah 27:8-19) and after-zeal to do God's will, this leader gives to each of these sons lessons of deep import suited to their different natures. His father heart goes out particularly to Corianton who has sinned grievously, consorting with the harlot Isabel, and otherwise forgetting his heritage of righteousness. To this erring one the saving truths of the gospel are expounded with searching insight and power. It is a sermon of profound truth not alone for Corianton but for all the world. Such gems of spiritual truth as the following shine through the words of loving-kindness: Ye cannot hide your crimes from God; and except ye repent they will stand as a testimony against you at the last day (Alma 39:8). Seek not after riches nor the vain things of this world; for behold, you cannot carry them with you (Alma 39:14). No unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of God (Mosiah 40:26). Wickedness never was happiness (Alma 41:10). Space permits only a glance at other stirring spiritual dramas in the great book. Pre-eminent among all of them is, of course, that which portrays with simple majesty the coming of Christ to the \"other sheep of his fold\" (See Third Nephi). Impressive evidence of the holding power of this story was given repeatedly a few years ago with the presentation of the pageant America's Witness for Christ at the Hill Cumorah. On one occasion the writer, with fully thirty thousand other folk of many creeds and classes (this an estimate of the state highway patrol), sat spellbound for two hours and more witnessing the unfolding in carefully selected and arranged scenes and lines taken in the main from the Book of Mormon. And finally, that other stirring last story of the sacred scripture picturing Moroni alone with the countless slain, and the records of gold he is charged to hide from the eyes of his enemies. This that the voice of God might in later years \"speak from the dust.\" And lastly, the promise of this American prophet: And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost (Moroni 10:4). Studies and Activities Note: For this study a copy of the Book of Mormon is essential. Let each member of the class provide herself with one. 1. Why may the Book of Mormon be called a \"Book of Books\"? B. What gives central purpose and unity to this \"many-in-one volume\"? 2. Explain briefly the term epic. B. Why may the word be applied to the story structure of the Book of Mormon as well as to the Old Testament? 3. Have someone read aloud expressively chapters two and three of I Nephi. B. Point out the basic qualities that make this an effective story. C. How might it be turned into a stirring little drama? 4. In what fundamental respect are the excellent stories of the Book of Mormon different from the stories commonly presented through fiction, on stages and screen today? Illustrate. 5. What preparedness is necessary to enhance appreciation and bring soul-lifting recreation from the Book of Mormon epic story? 6. Name two or more situations in the Book of Mormon that have stirring drama in them. Read, as time permits, selections portraying briefly such dramatic stories.

Alma 39:1-5; Alma 46:11-22; Third Nephi 11:1-12, 565 Note: Since time during the lesson will not permit an in-depth discussion of all these selections, it is suggested that each class member select one or two to read and discuss. Social Science Latter-day Saint Political Thought Lesson 2 Some Political Doctrines of the Book of Mormon Elder G. Homer Durham For Tuesday, November 23, 1948 Objective: Book of Mormon POLITICAL theory is concerned with the relation of man and the State. To that extent, political theory is the \"theology\" of the State and its politics, just as religion explains the relation between God and man. Political theory arose in the Greek city-states and served about the same purposes that religious philosophy serves—explaining, however, state and political activity and helping men to accept and reconcile their individual views with the needs of the State, rather than the needs of the Church as in the case of religion. Good religious philosophy helps explain tithing. Similarly, a political philosophy helps explain taxes. The explanations are usually quite different, but similar purposes are served. A really remarkable religious philosophy, however, goes beyond an explanation of man-Church-God relationships. It explains or attempts to explain, the phenomena of all life and objects in the universe. Accordingly, modern man can derive much doctrine (or \"political theory\") of great import from the great religions, particularly Mormonism. A sound political theory must meet the tests of \"all truth,\" including known or future facts. What do the doctrines of the Book of Mormon indicate for political thinking? The Nature of Man The nature of the State, whether it should be total or limited, depends largely on the answer to the question, what is a man? If man is mere animal material, the total State is probably as good as any, with power for its own sake as the highest good. On the other hand, if man has more than animal value, the State should recognize such values. The Book of Mormon, like other Christian scripture, teaches that man is valuable because he is the child of God. His destiny is not to be cannon fodder or the grist of concentration camps. Man is holy—any man. The State may be powerful, but God, too, is powerful.\n\nAnd man as the child of God must be respected by the State, whether in its criminal code, welfare law, selective service administration, or garbage collection. \"Men are instructed sufficiently that they know good from evil\" (2 Nephi 2:5.) But men, left to themselves and the State, however humane, are insufficient to \"save\" themselves. \"Wherefore, redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah; for he is full of grace and truth.\" There is \"opposition in all things\" (verse 11) and men must strive with all means at their disposal to work out the earth problems including political problems. But these means, while not discounting human brains, skill, and planning, must yet take into account the true nature of man and the existence of God as a factor in the equation. Humane methods may be all right. But if God and the spiritual forces of the universe be discounted or ignored, such ignorance will lead to material error. For there is a God, and he hath created all things, both the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are, both things to act and things to be acted upon (2 Nephi 2:14). And although God permits man to act for himself (verse 16), he can better act in view of the above facts if he wants the optimum result. Such is fundamental to political theory from the standpoint of Mormonism.\n\nThe Nature of Government\n\nThe Book of Mormon does not leave things at this point. The book contains a thousand-year profile of the rise, evolution through various forms, and fall of Nephite political institutions. From this experience emerges an interpretation of history more impressive to Latter-day Saints than the dialectical materialism of Karl Marx or the civilization-epoch-cycle theory of Oswald Spengler or A. J. Toynbee. This theory insists on the inclusion of God as a factor in civilization, as well as man, and can be stated as follows: When institutions, societies, or individuals conform to the demands of an expanding, growing concept of God's commands, they are prosperous and happy. When they depart therefrom, disease, decay, war, and destruction follow.\n\nAccordingly, King Mosiah - says (chapter 29, verse 10) \"Let us be wise... And do that which will make for the peace of this people.\" This he interpreted as striving to approximate the government of God, the ultimate standard, \"for the judgments of God are always just.\" Mosiah (29:10-29) makes one of the best arguments for popular government found in scripture. One-man rule would be all right if the man would always be good. But such is not the case. Moreover, if one man holds all power, and he is evil, a most bloody revolution is required to throw the resisting tyrant out. Therefore, choose representative judges, he admonished, and let them follow majority views. But, said he, the people must bear the responsibility, \"And if the time comes that the voice of the people doth choose iniquity, then is the time the judgments of God will come upon you!\"\n\nThe Welfare of the State\n\nHow, then, can government be kept \"good,\" aside from the fact that its construction and operation recognize God's existence and man's sonship? By the people remaining \"good\" and by their voice demanding the good! But people, by God's act, are free to do or be good or evil! Goodness cannot be forced! How, then, secure the public welfare? Here the Book of Mormon takes its stand with President George Washington who stated in his Farewell Address that \"of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports.\" Thus, when Nephite society was in a state of breakdown, similar to modern Europe, Alma the Chief Judge (Alma 4) launched no public relief program, \"seeing no way that he might reclaim them (his people) save it were in bearing down in pure testimony against them.\"\n\nAnd thus in the... Ninth year of the reign of the judges. _ Alma delivered up the judgment-seat to \"Nephihah, and confined himself wholly to the high priesthood of the holy order of God, to the testimony of the word, according to the spirit of revelation and prophecy (Alma 4:19-20). The roots of the social and political maladies of mankind are thus to be found in the people's morals. Political remedies, accordingly, the Book of Mormon teaches, must get at the roots. 'To merely deal with the effects of problems will only aggravate the fundamental causes. Alma, chapters 45-63, tells another, longer story of the Nephite patriot, Moroni, and \"the title of liberty\" while IV Nephi depicts the ideal results that can be obtained if men will but pursue truth. Both accounts are worth rereading.\n\nThus the State may not accomplish everything! Indeed, the welfare of the State requires a vigorous, moral people. 'The State, as Hitler's and others', may attempt to administer and enforce State morality; but this, probably, only for the benefit of the holders of power. Free men require freedom for moral standards. Free churches and other associations, then, can best minister to this fundamental human need in freedom and diversity, separate and apart from the State.\n\nQuestions for Discussion\n\n1. What are some tests of a sound political theory?\n2. What is the Latter-day Saint conception of the origin, nature and destiny of man?\n3. If mankind are the children of God, what essential rights should be maintained in organized society? Why?\n4. Can a political theory be sound if it ignores the existence of God? Why not? What practical difference does it make? Does the particular concept held concerning God's nature make any difference, or can it be any kind of belief in God?\n568\n\n5. According to the Book of Mormon, how can good government be maintained?\n6. How can people's morality be maintained at a high standard?\n7. How do you view contemporary moral standards? In what respects are they high and low? How can contemporary standards be improved.\n8. How do you think Alma, the great Nephite Judge, would handle such problems as the atomic bomb, traffic safety, human misery?\n\nSuggested References\n\nDuruam, G.

Edgar Lyon For Tuesday, November 23, 1948\n\nTHE PRESIDENCY A UNIT-THE THREE ARE ONE SIDNEY RIGDON JOSEPH SMITH FREDERICK G WILLIAMS Sidney Rigdon In many of the early revelations given to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord declared that a \"marvelous work\" was about to come forth on the earth and that the \"field is white already to harvest.\" Nowhere is the truth of this figure of speech seen JOSEPH SMITH FREDERICK G.\n\nWILLIAMS more clearly than in the preparatory work which the Lord had done in raising up men to assume positions of leadership in his Church. Sidney Rigdon, who served as first counselor to the Prophet Joseph Smith from 1833 to 1844 exemplifies the realization of this promise to a remarkable degree. He was born in Pennsylvania on February 19, 1793. In his twenty-fifth year, he joined the \"Regular Baptists\" and soon was one of their licensed preachers. In the autumn of 1821, he became the full-time minister of the First Baptist Church in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and through his eloquent preaching soon built up a large congregation. But the spirit of the Lord was at work in preparation for the restoration of the gospel and Sidney resigned his pulpit after two years and turned to manual labor, being unable to satisfy his conscience with the doctrines he was preaching. His study of the Bible led him to the conclusion that the true Church of Christ, as he read of it in the New Testament, was not on the earth. About this time, he made the acquaintance of two professional teachers who were likewise dissatisfied with the existing forms of Christianity. These men, Alexander Campbell and Walter Scott, in association with Sidney Rigdon, soon commenced preaching the need of the \"restoration of all things\" of which they read in the Bible, and Sidney moved to Ohio where he became the minister of a large congregation of people who called themselves \"Reformed Baptists\" and then later \"Disciples of Christ,\" but whom the people generally referred to as \"Campbellites\" after the dominant leader of the movement. These people preached that the true Christian Church should discard all man-made creeds, baptize by immersion only those who were capable of believing and had repented of their sins, and then held up to them the hope that God would ultimately restore the power by which the Holy Ghost could be conferred. At Mentor, Ohio, Sidney Rigdon was extremely popular and his influence was felt for many miles around, as he circuited about to other preaching stations for more than fifty miles from his home station. On one of these preaching missions to the west in the summer of 1829, he converted a young man from New York, Parley P. Pratt, who showed such ability as a preacher of the new doctrine that Parley was soon called to become a full-time minister for the \"Campbellite\" church. While engaged as a \"Campbellite\" missionary near Palmyra, New York, in August 1830, Parley heard of the Book of Mormon and the restoration of the gospel and soon accepted the truth. After converting some of his own family in New York State, Parley P. Pratt was called on a mission to the Indians. On the way he stopped at Mentor, Ohio, to acquaint his former friend, Sidney Rigdon, with the fact that the very thing they had been hoping would occur, had occurred, and that the true gospel had already been restored. Sidney Rigdon soon accepted the message as the fulfillment of his prayers and most of his large congregation followed him into the waters of baptism and spiritual regeneration, so well had he prepared them for the coming of the latter-day work. This was in November 1830, and the following month Sidney Rigdon went to visit the Prophet at Fayette, New York, and was called by revelation to preach the restored gospel (See section 35). From that time until the death of Joseph Smith, the two were closely associated in the leadership of the Church. On March 18, 1833, Sidney Rigdon was ordained and set apart as first counselor to Joseph Smith in the First Presidency of the Church and declared in a revelation to be accounted \"... Equal with thee in holding the keys of this last kingdom\" (section go:6). President Rigdon undertook this work with zeal. To follow the inter-workings of these two men would require a volume. However, the important items of activities can be briefly mentioned. One of the first tasks they did together was in revising by revelation the King James version of the Bible, Joseph doing the revising and Sidney acting as the secretary. Together Joseph and Sidney received the great vision found in section 76 of the Doctrine and Covenants. He accompanied the Prophet on various missions into Canada, Michigan, New York, Indiana, Illinois and Washington, D.C., in furtherance of the missionary work or the settlement of the saints' problems. When Joseph was absent from Church headquarters, such as in the summer of 1834 when he journeyed to and from Missouri with Zion's Camp, Sidney Rigdon directed the activities of the Church at Kirtland. President Rigdon was endowed with a gift of great eloquence, occupying the platform or pulpit on many important occasions. He stood firmly by the Prophet during the Missouri difficulties, spending part of the winter of 1838-1839 with Joseph and the other brethren in jail in Missouri, until his health failed and he was released. He did much good in Illinois in helping to gain a friendly welcome for the saints who were being exiled from Missouri. There was one element in his character that caused friction between him and the Prophet. He was self-willed and at times challenged the leadership of Joseph and the authority of the \"revealed word,\" attempting to force his opinions upon the Prophet and upon the Church, with the result that the Prophet was forced to rebuke him. At general conference of the Church, held at Nauvoo in October 1843, President Joseph Smith expressed dissatisfaction with him as a counselor and did not desire to retain him. Through the intercession of Hyrum Smith, however, he was retained in his office, but he never again seemed to manifest the spirit of leadership he had formerly possessed. He moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the spring of 1844 with the intention of presiding over the branches of the Church in the eastern portion of the United States. The Prophet's martyrdom caused him to hurry back to Nauvoo where he pressed his claim as \"guardian\" of the Church, but the Quorum of the Twelve was sustained as the presiding authority of the Church and Sidney Rigdon, disappointed and embittered, was later excommunicated. He returned to Pennsylvania and then settled in New York where he organized a church on the pattern of the restored church but it did not succeed. He unwaveringly adhered to his original statement concerning the Book of Mormon, denying any statement imputing the authorship of the work to himself. His death occurred July 14, 1876. He had given much to the Church, but personal pride and love for authority overpowered the spirit of God in him.\n\nFrederick G. Williams\nWhen Parley P. Pratt and his missionary companions arrived in Ohio in the fall of 1830 on their way to Missouri, among the number they converted, in addition to Sidney Rigdon, was a man of varied abilities—Frederick G. Williams.\n\nHe was born in Connecticut on October 28, 1787, but as the rocky New England country had reached a saturation point in agricultural population, he journeyed with thousands of other Connecticut youths to northeastern Ohio, which Connecticut claimed was her \"Western Reserve.\" There Frederick G. Williams prospered. He became an influential business man and took up the practice of Medicine. Few doctors on the frontier in those days were trained in medical college, but acquired their training by experience with other doctors or in taking correspondence courses in the properties of various herbs and chemical compounds. Such was the training of Dr. Williams, yet coupling this information with much good common sense and a clever ability to diagnose common ailments, he attained a fair measure of success in his profession.\n\nDr. Williams had become so well prepared for the acceptance of the restoration of the gospel by Sidney Rigdon and other \"Campbellite\" preachers that he embraced the new religion with heart and soul. Desirous of bending his efforts to the promotion of the cause and leaving his medical practice, he started off with Parley P. Pratt and the others turning to Ohio the following year, he forged to the front as a man of great leadership ability and when the First Presidency was organized on March 18, 1833, Elder Williams was set apart as second counselor to Joseph Smith, being eighteen years older than the Prophet. For about four years he labored diligently in this capacity, being declared equal with Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon in \"...holding the keys of this last kingdom\" (D. & C. 90:6). During these years, he accompanied the Prophet on the trip with Zion's Camp to Missouri. Returning to Kirtland, he worked diligently on the project for construction of the Kirtland Temple. With Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon he designed the interior of that sacred structure, and then gave liberally of his means for its construction.\n\nWhen the Church printing plant at Independence, Missouri, was destroyed by mob violence in the summer of 1833, the Church was without a publication house to print its literature. President Williams, being financially able, took a leading part in establishing a printing office at Kirtland, known as \"F. G. Williams and Company\" and continued the publication of the Church periodical at Kirtland. With Oliver Cowdery and Sidney Rigdon, he was appointed to compile the revelations that the Prophet had received and prepare them for publication. This resulted in the publication of the first edition of the Doctrine and Covenants that was issued from his shop in Kirtland in the late summer of 1835. This was probably his most noteworthy accomplishment. His chief contribution to the\n\nChurch was his leadership in temporal matters.\nThe Prophet and President Williams commenced to have misunderstandings as the contended that the Prophet was exceeding his authority when he professed to receive revelations dealing with temporal matters. On the 7th of November, 1837, he was dropped as a member of the First Presidency during a conference held at Far West, Missouri, and Hyrum Smith replaced him. The estrangement became greater, and he was finally excommunicated from the Church in March 1839. But at the conference held in Nauvoo in April 1840, he appeared and asked to be readmitted to the Church. Prophesying over Smith plied his case for him; he was baptized and died in full fellowship at Quincy, Illinois, on October 10, 1842. His descendants came to Utah and are faithful members of the Church.\nWilliam Law\nWhen Hyrum Smith was called to the office of Patriarch to the Church in 1841, the position of second counselor in the Presidency of the Church was filled by William Law. He was born in Canada in 1809, being four years younger than the Prophet. He was converted primarily by John Taylor and, some time in 1839, moved to Nauvoo where he soon became one of its leading business men. He was a member of the city council, operated a store and several mills, and was engaged in the real estate business and as a building contractor.\nAs a counselor in the First Presidency, his greatest support to Joseph Smith came from his advice."

    "content": "The Family Picture Show\nIvie H. Jones\nPresident, Spanish-American Mission Relief Society\n\nMY Dear Aunt Martha:\n\nI guess I really shouldn't address you as Aunt, but that's what Mother used to call you. Let's see, you must be a third cousin, but that's unimportant. You belong to the same family and have some Calkins blood in your veins, and that makes me proud of you, even though I have never seen you. And because you are a relative and the oldest hiring member of your side of the family, I am writing you this letter.\n\nUnder separate cover, we are mailing you quite a collection of photographs, snaps, and tintypes. I am sure you would wonder what on earth it was all about, if I did not write and explain the matter in advance. Last night we held our annual \"Family Picture Show.\" It's an old idea of Mother's and has grown into quite an event in our family, and because it was Mother's original idea, we have held it on her birthday.\n\nSometimes it has been impossible for all of us to get together on that particular day, as we are quite scattered, but in that went we have held our own \"Family Picture Show.\" Yesterday was Mother's birthday, the first one since she died, and all of us were together, quite a group, children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. We met in the old home, and in spite of the fact that Mother and Daddy weren't there, it carried on according to the old custom.\n\nWe all had dinner together, then while the children played outside, we grownups checked our photographs, exchanged with each other, and then saw to it that every picture was identified by the names on the back in ink. I can just hear Mother say, \"Upon my word, it makes me sick the way some folks spend good money for pictures and then never take the time to identify them. Then when the old folks die, the pictures mean nothing to the children, so into the wastebasket they go.\"\n\nMother and Daddy were always proud of our family, from the ancestors to the great-grandchildren, and they wanted all of us to know our relatives when we saw them. The \"Family Hour\" that followed was choice, for it offered opportunity for our different families to present their talents in song, original composition, and verse. And the climax of the evening was our \"Family Picture Show.\"\n\nWe have a toy projector that Mother and Daddy bought for us one Christmas, it must have been twenty-five years ago. It cost only five dollars, but it has certainly been worth many times that amount to us. It is a simple little projector, quipped with two electric lights and mirrors inside, and we just slip the pictures in, upside down, and they are reflected on a screen or wall — and in color, too.\n\nIt is surprising how even our little tots know their great-grandparents, their aunts and uncles, and even their cousins, when their pictures are thrown on the screen. I am sure that I would know you if I should ever see you on the street, even though I have never actually seen you in my life.\n\nYesterday afternoon we found a lot of pictures of your side of the family that we thought would mean more to you than they do to us. However, if you already have copies of them, we would be glad to have them back. There is one tintyped marked \"Cristina\" that I am especially interested in. Perhaps it is because my full name is Page 622 THE FAMILY PICTURE SHOW 623 Anna Cristine, but I have always been called just \"Ann.\" Or perhaps I am interested in the picture because there is a bit of mystery connected with it.\n\nI have asked Mother about this tintype many times, only to be put off. Once I asked her why she didn't add the maiden name, or married name, that is, if this Cristina was ever married. But Mother merely said, \"No, my dear, Cristina signed her own name on the picture and that's enough. I know who she was and you children don't know her anyway.\"\n\nStill not satisfied, I pressed the matter further, only to be told that Cristina died when her first baby was born and the second wife did such a marvelous job of caring for her baby that the family decided not to tell her who her real mother was. \"Put the tintype back in the drawer,\" Mother said, \"I will be going to Utah sometime and I will find out if the daughter knows. I have never asked, and no one has ever said.\"\n\nOnce Mother did, however, write something on the bottom of the picture, and yesterday we used a magnifying glass and made out the name of Cristina's parents. Maybe you will know where she fits into the family, or perhaps she is just a dear friend of Mother's.\n\nPlease excuse this lengthy letter, and if you do not know to whom the tintype picture belongs, return it to me, as I would like to keep it.\n\nLots of love to all.\n\nYour cousin, Ann: Your letter and the pictures came several days ago, but I have been too excited to write. The children and grandchildren are all coming over for my birthday today and we are having our first \"Family Picture Show.\" Many thanks for the idea. Lots of love. Aunt Martha\n\nP.S. Yes, I know who this Christine is, and the tintype is worth the world to me. She was an orphan girl from Norway. She joined the Church, and the rest of the family disowned her. Later, she came to Utah and married and had one daughter. We have spent a great deal of money trying to discover her parents. I am so glad that your mother wrote on the picture before she died, \"Daughter of Tildy and Hans Nielson.\" Thanks a million, Ann, that's my mother.\n\nWINDS OF FEAR\nC. Cameron Johns\n\nWinds of fear are blowing through the night\nThat the windbreaks of the heart cannot abate.\nWith subtle infiltrations, they would kill\nThe tendrils of our hope, regenerate.\nOnly barricades within the soul\nOf ancient kindnesses withhold their blight.\nOnly love's assurance can resist\nThe winds of fear that blow across the night.\n\nNotes from the field\nMargaret C. Pickering, General Secretary-Treasurer\n\nAll materials submitted for publication in this department should be sent through stake and mission Relief Society presidents.

Branch President Leslie is a baker and confectioner, so we saved our rations and helped him with the ingredients for the cake. It really was beautiful, more like a bride's cake. The picture on top of the cake was made in sugar, representing the first house in which the Relief Society was held, copied from a picture which the elders gave Brother Leslie.\nIt was a lovely table, well worth the sacrifice of our rations.\nOur Relief Society had a show of work and sale on April 17th, with a concert following. It was a great success. The hand-knitted articles made and donated by members and friends brought in around $100.

Have the years made obsolete man's burning desire to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience?\nThe Constitution of the United States is the greatest charter of religious liberty ever written. It will never become obsolete so long as men love democracy more than despotism, liberty more than bondage, God more than the paganism of unbelief.\n\nThe Art of Beautiful Tone Quality in Singing\nPART II\n\nFlorence J. Madsen\nMember, Relief Society General Board\n\nThe language of tones belongs equally to all mankind, and melody is the absolute language in which the musician speaks to every heart (Richard Wagner).\n\nThe Laws of Acoustics\n\nBEAUTY of tone is dependent upon the presence of overtones with their fundamentals. To insure the proper predominance of these essential elements the singer must observe the laws of acoustics.\nSome of these are:\n(a) The motion of the vibrating column must be regular and unobstructed.\n(b) The vibrations must be focused in the direction of, and into all possible open cavities for amplification.\n(c) There must be no localization of tone in any one cavity, but equal activity to the exclusion of the others. All the cavities of the head and bones of the face are vocal resonators and, therefore, must be used in speaking and in singing.\n\nListening\nNature has given to men one tongue, but two ears, that we may hear from others twice as much as we speak (Epictetus).\nWhile listening to music one should be so intent upon what he hears that he can recall, at will, the tone quality he has heard, for comparison with other tonal experiences that he might have.\n\nImitating\nOne of the most effective means of learning is that of imitating. This fact is voiced by Weiss in the following statement: \"Imitation forms our manners, our opinions, our very lives.\" Imitation also leads to spontaneous originality. This is strongly asserted by Voltaire as follows: \"A good imitation is the most perfect originality.\"\nIn order to acquire perfect tone quality one must, therefore, imitate the perfect in tonal art.\n\nReasoning\nReasoning is the cornerstone of all sound thinking.\n\nIt is basically essential to a full understanding of beautiful tone quality. Such reasoning should include, at least, the following facts:\n(a) To become an aesthetic singer is a distinctive achievement.\n(b) To produce beautiful tones one must first submerge his preconceived notions of tone to the more ideal type of tonal quality as heard in the singing of artists.\n(c) The characteristics and mechanics of beautiful tones of the arts can be understood only in proportion as they are unfolded and applied in sincere efforts to sing.\n(d) Tone quality can be improved only as far as faults are overcome and proper habits established.\nIt should be remembered that, as Gilpin says, \". . . Good habits are formed by acts of reason. . . .\"\nLESSON Department Theology The Life and Ministry of the Savior Lesson 11 \"He Spake Many Things Unto Them In Parables\" Elder Don B. Colton (Reference: Jesus the Christ, Chapter 19, by Elder James E. Talmage) For Tuesday, December 7, 1948 Objective: To create a desire to study and understand the gospel of the kingdom. Note: All quotations which are not followed by references are taken from the text Jesus the Christ.\nDuring the early part of his ministry Jesus was popular. In fact, frequently the multitudes surrounding him were so large they would impede his progress. Because of these large crowds, he found it difficult at times to speak to the multitudes. He, therefore, devised the plan of going to the seashore and having his disciples provide a \"small ship\" which was kept in readiness for him and in which he sat down and spoke to the crowds. The boat would be anchored a short distance from the shore. It was during one of these meetings at the water's edge that he adopted the method of explaining his talks by using parables.\nAll students admit that the Savior was the Master Teacher of the world. In teaching, he followed no definite plan or method. He drew his examples from nature. He would see a sower at work in a field, a fox running across his path, a woman at a well, and each would provide him a story to illustrate his doctrine. The things of nature were his own creations and, of course, he knew how to use them to the best advantage.\n\"A Sower Went Forth to Sow\"\nThe parable of the sower was probably the first parable used by the Savior in teaching. Everyone is familiar with this parable, but there are many who contend that it should, in reality, be called the parable of the soil. The story is as follows:\nAnd when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up: Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth: And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away. And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them: But others fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.\nWho hath ears to hear, let him hear (Matt. 13:4-9).\nThis method of teaching was a new one even to the disciples and was a departure from the Savior's earlier method. He, therefore, gave an interpretation to this parable. In brief, his interpretation was as follows:\nHear ye therefore the parable of the sower. When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side. But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended. He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty (Matt. 13:18-23).\nSpace will not permit the giving in full of all of the Savior's parables. The parable of the sower is given as an example. All of the parables of the New Testament may be studied with great profit. They are masterpieces of beautiful and effective literature. Only a few salient features will be given here.\nAbove all we should notice that the Savior had prepared well for his listeners. He was the sower. However, the parable would apply to any authorized servant of the Lord. \"The seed is the word of God.\" He described four grades of soil. First, the compacted roof or highway made by people and hindered animals walking along or over it. It was natural for those near these highways even to cross fields which had been sown to grain. Second: the shallow soil, underlaid by rock, would sustain the sprouting plant only for a short time, after which it would wither and die. Third: the soil upon which weed seed had been sown. Ground otherwise capable of producing a crop would not yield because of the thickness of thistles and thorns. Fourth and last: the fertile soils which would yield an increase of thirty, sixty, or even an hundredfold.\nIt is interesting to note that the thorns which spring up in the poor grade of soil to choke the word of God are the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches.\" In good soil, the teacher sows the seeds of truth with anticipation and enthusiasm, knowing that there will be a harvest; perhaps not the expected harvest, but still thirtyfold if not an hundredfold\" (Dr. Carl F. Eyring-Good Tidings to All People). Even Jesus was limited by the soil. Let teachers learn to prepare well the soil.\nThe Wheat and the Tares\nAnother of the Master's great parables was the one about the wheat and the tares. (Matt. 13:24-30; 36-43) Here Jesus changes and has the seed represent the children of men. The good seed typifies the honest in heart and the righteous in the kingdom of God, while the tares are the evil minded and those who keep not the commandments of the Lord. The Master's servants wanted to immediately pull them up, but were told it could not be done without great destruction of the precious grain. The disciples were taught a lesson of patience, tolerance, and forbearance. They were assured that a time would come when there would be a separation and the tares would be burned. The time and manner were to be left to the Lord.\nThe Lord, speaking to Joseph Smith in 1832, referred to this parable (D. & C. 86:4-7). It is suggested that the entire section be read.\n\nThe Mustard Seed\nThe application made in the parable of the mustard seed was entirely in terms, for the children of Israel had long looked forward to the coming in great glory of the Messiah. It startled them to hear its beginning compared with a mustard seed. However, the use of the mustard plant for food was common among the Jews. In Palestine the mustard plant attains a largeness in comparison with time than it does in the northerly climes. The lesson of the parable is relatively easy to learn. \"... the seed of truth is vital, living, and capable of such development as to furnish spiritual food and shelter to all who come seeking.\" The size of the kingdom to be was not to be judged because it had a small beginning.\n\nThe Leaven\nThe parable of the leaven is quoted frequently. It is easily understood. Like the one last considered, it typifies the vitality and inherent power to grow. Yeast diffuses itself throughout a lifeless lump and changes the flour to a buoyant mass of dough. The truths of the gospel have the power within themselves when understood, to leaven the whole lump of humanity. Both the leaven in the flour and the spread of truth are sometimes slow in action but they work quietly and effectively.\n\nA. Perry Picture Hofmann\nCHRIST TEACHING FROM A BOAT\n\nWhile the leaven symbolizes truth, it must be remembered that the same thing, in different aspects, may be used to represent evil. Evil power may also permeate or \"leaven\" the whole lump.\n\nThe Hidden Treasure\nThe parable of the hidden treasure is recorded only by Matthew (13:44). The critic has often said that it was not honest for the finder to conceal the discovery of the treasure from the owner of the field. We may be assured that Jesus would not commend a dishonest act. The finder followed the Jewish law and all that was done was in accordance with the law of the day. Let us remember, also, that in the parabolic teaching of the day, little attention was given to what might be called the trappings, or outward forms. Certainly no one would, or did consider these trappings as an integral part of the story.\n\nThe happy man who found the treasure sold all he possessed and gave up everything gladly in order that he might purchase the field. The Master taught by this illustration that when once the treasure of the kingdom is found, the finder should lose no time nor shrink from any sacrifice needful to insure his title thereto.\n\nThe Pearl of Great Price\nThe parable of the pearl of great price should be carefully studied (Matt. 13:45-46). Of course, the pearl is used to represent great value. The merchant was seeking goodly pearls.\n\nWhen he found one which excelled all others, he sacrificed all he had to obtain it; it was the pearl of great price. The pearl represents truth. When it is found, no price is too great for its possession. No one can truly become a citizen of the kingdom who is unwilling to surrender all for that citizenship. \"The amount each person must pay depends on how much is 'his all.' That only is a sufficient price.\"\n\nLatter-day Saints have a great heritage. Their pioneer forebears gave their all for the \"pearl of great prices.\"\n\nThe Gospel Net\nDr. John A. Widtsoe, in his book The Gospel Net, gives pathos and meaning to the parable of the same name. The gospel of the kingdom has been preached in many lands. It has gathered into its folds good and bad people, mostly good. Often the sorting does not take place until the people have gathered in Zion, and it may not be completely done there. The great \"Fisher of Men\" will make the final sorting eventually. The just and the unjust will be separated, and each given a reward according to merit.\n\nQuestions and Suggestions for Discussion\n1. State why you think Jesus was a great teacher. From what source did he draw his great examples to illustrate his teaching?\n2. Relate the parable of the sower and tell why it is sometimes called the parable of the soil.\n3. Describe the parable of the wheat and the tares. What was the lesson taught by it?\n4. If a copy of the book The Gospel Net is available, have someone tell briefly the story of the conversion of the mother of Dr. John A. Widtsoe.\n\nLESSON DEPARTMENT 637\nVisiting Teachers Messages\nOur Savior Speaks Lesson 3 \"Inasmuch as Ye Have Done It Unto One of the Least of These My Brethren, Ye Have Done It unto Me\"\nElder H. Wayne Driggs\n\nFor Tuesday, December 7, 1948\nObjective: To reaffirm what constitutes the true spirit of giving.\n\nThen shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger and ye took me in: Naked and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord when saw we thee an hungered, and fed thee? Or thirsty, and gave thee drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? Or naked, and clothed thee? Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me (Matt. 25:34-40).\n\nIn essence, is thought of as being temporal rather than spiritual. Most of us are earth-drawn throughout the majority of our living days. We seek learning, work, position, and favor among our fellow men. In our struggle to attain these, we find passing satisfaction in the material things of the world. But there are greater things than these which make the material gains of life of secondary importance. The important values are the joys of the spirit. These come from the perfect service of feeding the Master's sheep.\n\nIt is said by modern teachers that if someone holds a grudge against you, and you can get that person to do you a favor, his enmity will disappear for we cannot dislike one to whom we do good. Is it not true that one reason for the love of parents for their children is that they minister lovingly to the needs of their offspring? How then can we demonstrate our love for our Savior whom we cannot meet face to face? By obeying the first great commandment and the second which is like unto it: by loving our neighbors as ourselves. Then we shall better understand that the Lord who so loved each of us that he suffered death that we might live, accepts the service we give any of our brethren as being given to him.\n\nWhat a great opportunity our Church affords us to give such service through accepting calls to work in any capacity. \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me\" (Matthew 25:40). \n\nWork Meeting Sewing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting) Lesson 3 Making Women's Wear from Men's Wear Jean Ridges Jennings\n\nFor Tuesday, December 14, 1948\n\nN most cases the wool used in men's suits, if it is of good quality, is far sturdier and more durable than that available in stores for women's clothing. Even after it has been discarded as shabby or worn out, the average man's suit offers unusual opportunities for making-over, because of the excellence of its texture and quality. The worn parts are usually found in places where they can be ignored when making over the man's suit into one for a woman. Such parts as sleeve edges, plackets, trouser seat, and cuffs can all be cut away without interfering with a woman's suit. When making a man's suit over into a street suit for yourself, it is usually necessary to shorten the sleeves, which does away with the worn part, and it is unnecessary to use the upper part of the trousers which eliminates those worn parts. The legs of the trousers are turned upside down to make the skirt, bringing any weak spots toward the hem and also allowing a little flare at the bottom. Fit the coat to your proportions. Make the shoulders narrower with a center dart tapered to the bustline in front. Narrow the neckline at the center back seams of coat and collar. Adjust the hip and waistline with a dart taken from the coat hem to under the bust, being sure it is in line with the shoulder dart. The side seams can be fitted as needed according to the lines of the figure. Sleeves can be taken in as needed, tapering them to match the underarm seams and the armhole. Shorten as necessary.\n\nUsing the upper part of the trousers for the bottom, make a four-gored skirt. The new longer length can be obtained by making a fitted yoke for the top of the skirt from the unused top of the trousers or from the vest. When the man's suit is too faded or shabby to use on the right side, tip the suit to pieces, clean and remake using the wrong side of the fabric for the right side of your suit. The entire suit will need to be recut, using a commercial pattern.\n\nOn most women the pockets in a man's coat come rather low. If they are patch pockets, they can be raised. If bound or flap pockets, a patch pocket can be set over them at a higher more becoming level. An attractive lady's suit can be made by cutting the coat short to just below the waistline thus avoiding the pockets entirely. For this model the collar can be eliminated and a plain fitted neckline used instead. If the suit is striped, many clever effects can be devised as trimming by reversing the stripes in bands, pockets, yokes, etc.\n\nLast, but not least, the man's coat could be easily made into a bolero.\n\nShop the easy way at Sears convenient\nCATALOG SALES DEPT.\nIt's easy, economical to shop at Sears Catalog Order Desk for hundreds of items unobtainable in retail stores. No money order fees . . . and if you pick up your order at the Catalog Sales store you pay no C.O.D. fee.\n\nMain or State at 9th South Salt Lake City Park Free\nSEARS"

Richards Salt Lake City Attorney, formerly Assistant Legal Advisor to the Secretary of State of the United States, and formerly a member of the Y.M.M.I.A. General Board AFTER more than 150 years of struggle and self-sacrifice our forefathers issued a Declaration of Independence, declaring:\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\nThis was a declaration of personal and religious liberty and had been brought about not by a controversy with the mother country over property rights of great material value—the entire cargo of tea destroyed in Boston Harbor had a value of less than 18,000 pounds, and the tax amounted to only a few pence. But the principles involved were to the colonists worth more than life itself. Their fathers before them had abandoned everything they had of material value, and had wandered around Europe seeking personal liberty and the right to worship God according to their own conscience.\nEleven years later, amid after bloodshed and victory, the colonists met to establish a government that would protect the liberties and the religious rights for which they had fought.\nIn the preamble to the Constitution, they declared:\nWe, the people of the United States,\nin order to form a more perfect Union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.\nThe American statesmen who gave us our Constitution were, almost without exception, of English birth or descent, were experienced in government and had an intimate knowledge of the history, institutions, and common law of England and of humanity's struggle for personal and religious liberty.\nThe principal end they had in view was to protect individual rights against arbitrary and despotic power, whether exercised by a king, Parliament, or by any government which might be set up by the people themselves.\nThey gave us a Constitution that does protect the individual against the arbitrary powers of the President and Congress by a careful separation of the branches of government, each of which is a check upon the other.\nThe instrument provides that:\nCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . .\nAt the point of the sword, in the year 1215, the people forced King John to give them the Magna Charta, the first great charter of personal liberty. By the control of the \"purse strings\" in the year 1628, the Parliament forced Charles I to sign the Petition of Rights, the second great charter of personal liberty. In 1689, after Parliament had declared the throne vacant and elected William and Mary as rulers, they approved the Bill of Rights, the third great charter of personal liberty. These charters of personal liberty were attained through centuries of bloodshed and human sacrifice, and they formed the solid foundation upon which our Constitution was built by men whose ancestors had fought and bled to win them.\nAfter the Constitutional Convention had been in session for four or five weeks without agreeing upon a single sentence or paragraph of the Constitution, Benjamin Franklin arose in the convention on June 28, 1787, and said, in part: In the beginning of the contest with Great Britain, when we were sensible of danger, we had daily prayer in this room for the divine protection. Our prayers, Sir, were heard, and they were graciously answered; All of us who were engaged in the struggle must have observed frequent instances of a superintending Providence in our favor. To that kind Providence we owe this happy opportunity of consulting in peace on the means of establishing our future national felicity, and have we now forgotten that powerful Friend? Or do we imagine that we no longer need his assistance? I have lived, Sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth that God governs in the affairs of men, and if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the sacred writings that, \"Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it.\" I firmly believe this, and I also believe that without his concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better than the builders of Babel. Whether the framers knew it or not, the same divine Providence that assisted the colonists in gaining their freedom, also directed the framers in establishing our Constitution.\nIf you believe that the Lord ever has concerned himself with the affairs of men, then it is not difficult to believe that he had a hand in establishing our Government and our Constitution. Save the coming of our Savior and the establishing of his Church, no event that has occurred in the world's history has contributed more to the happiness and well-being of mankind than the establishment of this Government under the Constitution of the United States.\nTherefore, if the Lord concerns himself with big and important things pertaining to the welfare of mankind, and we know he does, the framing of our Constitution was worthy of his attention and direction. The Lord said to Joseph Smith, \"I established the Constitution of this land\" (D. & C. 101:70). When his people because of their religious belief had been driven from Independence, Missouri, and their homes confiscated and burned, and many of their members murdered, Joseph Smith, the Prophet of modern times, who was then in Kirtland, Ohio, organized a company of strong men to go to the rescue of those who had been so unjustly persecuted, but before applying force he asked guidance of the same Father of light that Benjamin Franklin had implored in the struggle for liberty.\n\nHis prayers were similarly answered and the Lord spoke to him in these words: \"And again I say unto you, those who have been scattered by their enemies, it is my will that they should continue to importune for redress, and redemption, by the hands of those who are placed as rulers and are in authority over you. According to the laws and Constitution of the people, which I have suffered to be established, and should be maintained for the rights and protection of all flesh, according to just and holy principles.... And for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose... (D&C 101:76f).\" President Brigham Young made it plain that this Government, under our Constitution, was established by the Almighty himself, that he might have a nation on this earth guaranteeing sufficient religious liberty to its citizens that he could safely restore his gospel and establish his kingdom without the danger of its being destroyed. On this subject President Young said: \"The Almighty... moved upon Columbus to launch forth upon the trackless deep to discover the American Continent; he moved upon the signers of the Declaration of Independence; and he moved upon Washington to fight and conquer, in the same way as he moved upon ancient and modern prophets each being inspired to accomplish the particular work he was called to perform in the times, seasons, and dispensations of the Almighty. God's purpose in raising up these men and inspiring them with daring sufficient to surmount every opposing power, was to prepare the way for the formation of a true republican government. We believe that the Lord has been preparing that when he should bring forth his work, that, when the set time should fully come, there might be a place upon his footstool where sufficient liberty of conscience should exist, that his saints might dwell in peace under the broad panoply of constitutional law and equal rights. In this view we consider that the men in the Revolution were inspired by the Almighty, to throw off the shackles of the mother government, with her established religion. For this cause were Adams, Jefferson, Franklin, Washington, and hosts of others inspired to deeds of resistance to the acts of the King of Great Britain, who might also have been led to those aggressive acts, for ought we know, to bring to pass the purposes of God, in thus establishing a new government upon a principle of greater freedom, a basis of self-government allowing the free exercise of religious worship (Discourses of Brigham Young, pp. 551-552).\" Speaking of our Constitution and its framers, President Young said: \"Although unknown to them, it was dictated by the revelations of Jesus Christ.\" The governments of Europe are now passing through a despotism which our ancestors passed through seven hundred years ago. Stating it in another way, the countries of Europe, so far as concerns freeing themselves from despotism and establishing personal and religious liberty, are more than seven hundred years behind our Constitution of the United States. There are some even within our own country who are now declaring that age and the years have made our Constitution obsolete. I ask you, are the Ten Commandments of Moses obsolete because they were thundered forth from Sinai 4,000 years ago? Have the years made obsolete the wisdom of Solomon? (Continued on page 631) THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY 581 The sisters of the Church have been engaged for this past year in a great undertaking which will stand to their credit forever. The spirit of this call to collect money to erect a Relief Society Building has penetrated to the hearts of the sisterhood throughout the world. Quota payments are being received from faraway missions from which the general board did not expect to get any material help at all due to present economic conditions, although they knew that they would lend their full support otherwise. It is a cause of rejoicing to read the letters which accompany the remittances. Although scarcely a handful of these sisters will, in all probability, ever have the opportunity to enter the portals of the Relief Society Building, they have caught the vision of the undertaking and have given liberally to this great cause from their very limited means. Sister Piranian, Relief Society president of the Palestine-Syrian Mission, writes: \"It is with great pleasure that I am able to submit to you the donations for the new Relief Society Building from this mission, and to tell you that we have met our quota, 100%.\" I wish to extend to you the love and friendship of all the sisters here in Lebanon and Syria. Sister Huntsman, Relief Society president of the Tongan Mission, says: \"In regards to the new Relief Society building, I am happy to tell you that the Relief Society sisters of the Tongan Mission are very happy to have the privilege of giving their contribution along with the other Relief Society sisters throughout the Church. This I feel is a splendid record when we consider the conditions of the saints here, and the small amount of money they have; but it is proof that the gospel of Jesus Christ, when accepted and lived regardless of race or color, brings forth the same fruits of love and service. I appreciate very much having the privilege of working with such fine women as our Tongan women are, and their willingness to do the things I have felt inspired to ask of them. The brethren have been very helpful in assisting the sisters to complete their quotas.\" The following letter from President Adiel F. Stewart of the Palestine-Syrian Mission is included for reference: \"It is with great pleasure that I am able to submit to you the donations for the new Relief Society Building from this mission, and to tell you that we have met our quota, 100%.\"\n\nSister Huntsman, Relief Society president of the Tongan Mission, says: In regards to the new Relief Society building I am happy to tell you that the Relief Society sisters of the Tongan Mission are very happy to have the privilege of giving their contribution along with the other Relief Society sisters throughout the Church . . .

Bill had gone without kissing her goodbye—he didn't want to make up after their quarrel last night!\n\nShe was still dabbing her eyes thinking what a stubborn mouth Bill had, that even his chin was stubborn, too, when the mailman brought Cousin Stella's invitation to her silver wedding anniversary.\n\nAn hour later, after packing her suitcase, Hollis wrote a crisp little note to Bill:\n\nI'm accepting Cousin Stella's invitation to her silver wedding anniversary. Marrying you was the biggest mistake a woman for twenty-five years. I don't. So I'll let you know when I find out.\n\nShe took the bus to Hanover, thirty-five miles away, sighing as she leaned back in the seat. Dear, lovable Stella, happily married to big Ted Martin for twenty-five years!\n\nHollis felt her throat ache when she thought about it.\n\nWhat would Stella say if she knew that Hollis and Bill, married only one year next week, had had a heartbreaking quarrel—that the tiniest push would send her running home to mother? But not a word about it to Stella, she promised herself; Stella had found the secret of happy marriage, and Hollis determined to learn what it was. And it might be, too, that Stella wasn't married to a man like Bill.\n\nStella met her at the station. She\nwas a dark flame of a woman, radiating love like a warm fire, exclaiming as she hugged Hollis: \"You're a scarecrow—thin as a wafer! What's eating you, baby?\"\n\nIt was easy to laugh when you were with Stella. You could swallow your heartache while you listened to her rich, flowing voice. Stella had a straightforward attitude about everything—even her husband and her sons.\n\"Ted's just the same old rascal,\" she went on gaily. \"And the boys are away at school. Those kids! We're so grateful for them. But of course they'll get married someday and forget how Ted and I sacrificed for their schooling. But that's the way it should be.\"\nShe talked on eagerly, and Hollis thought how wonderful to look at life the way Stella did.\n\nHOLLIS loved Stella's big, white house on Circle Street. It had that lived-in feeling, she thought enviously; you weren't afraid to curl up cozily in the comfy old chairs—even old Ezra, the dog, stretched before the fireplace as though he belonged there, and Stella didn't mind the white hairs he left on the rug.\n\nIt was fun to help with dinner. Stella had such lovely linens and dishes, older than those which Hollis had, and worn, too, but she handled them tenderly as though she loved them more with each passing year.\n\"We'll use the rose china,\" she told Hollis as they set the table.\n\"Ted loves those dishes—his mother gave them to us—and he likes the heavy glasses. He hates stem goblets—he's always knocking them over with his elbows—so I just use the kind that don't bother him.\"\n\"Real Ted! Real! Scalloped potatoes because Ted liked them, steak for the same reason, and the fresh apple pie was Ted's very favorite!\nHer soft little mouth fell into a sour droop. So giving a man what he liked to eat was one of the little tricks of Stella's successful marriage record.\n\nDashing upstairs to freshen up a bit before dinner, she remembered last month when her chum, Peg, had come down to visit them and Bill had grumbled about the food all the time she was there. Could Hollis help it because Peg didn't want fattening foods like biscuits and deep custard pie made from his mother's recipe? They had quarreled after Peg left and Bill had shown a bad temper that Hollis hadn't known he had before she married him.\n\"This is my home,\" he had bellowed at her. \"I expect to be treated as if I belong here. A fellow gets hungry for something besides spring salad and crackers!\"\nHollis had cried herself to sleep that night. Why hadn't Bill married a cook if that meant so much to him, she had asked herself, desperately.\n\nNow as she changed into a gay print dress, she wondered if Ted Martin had ever acted that way and what Stella had done about it?\n\nAt six o'clock everything was ready for dinner. Stella and Hollis listened to the radio while they waited for Ted. Hollis, still smiling,\nstudied Stella's reaction to his tardiness closely. But Stella was serene as a Sunday morning walk. Once her eyes strayed to the clock and she said, casually, \"Ted works so hard—things have piled up for him lately—he has a new stenographer this week.\"\n\nCurled up in the big chair by the radio, Hollis thought how furious she had been last night when Bill didn't get home to dinner because some important letters had to be written and he was breaking in a new stenographer. Of course Bill's job was important, but after all a wife should come first!\n\nAt seven o'clock, Stella, still smiling, thought maybe they should eat dinner while things were still warm.\n\"Ted's like a boy,\" she said, aiming at Hollis with that tender mother-look, \"an irresponsible boy. He likes to play on the way home.\"\n\nHOLLIS saw an opening. \"But, Stella! Doesn't it make you furious when he's late like this?\"\n\"Furious?\" Stella's eyes were like dark sunshine. \"Why, no, Hollis, I don't think of it that way any more. Ted works so hard—he needs a little fun.\"\n\nThis was too much for Hollis. She flopped back in the big chair and stared up at Stella, her eyes a disapproving blue.\n\"Stella Martin! I don't believe it—you're not human, that's all. Ted could phone you, he could send a message somehow, no matter what—\"\n\"Listen, pet,\" Stella's voice flowed on as smoothly as Old Man River. \"If Ted has to interrupt his fun to phone me then he'll lose the some-588 fit he gets from forgetting about me for awhile.\"\n\n\"I give up,\" wailed Hollis, tossing her hands up. \"If you can tell me you want Ted to forget you, even for one second, then you've stopped loving him. A wife might as well quit as to feel that way!\"\n\nStella shook her head, pursing her lips, and her eyes darkened thoughtfully. \"That's not true, Hollis. It's because I do love Ted that I feel the way I do about things. You see, honey,\" she sat on the arm of the chair, twirling her fingers in Hollis's rusty curls, \"I used to love myself a lot more than I loved Ted or even the boys. It was always little me that I was thinking about. Oh, I was a perfect wife, all right,\" this in answer to Hollis's piercing look. \"At least I thought I was. Now I know I was a selfish little cat.\"\n\n\"You couldn't be selfish,\" Hollis defended. \"You've always been an angel to Ted and Bud and Dick, too.\" Stella laughed, jumping to her feet. \"Maybe we better eat. Ted wouldn't want us to wait any longer.\"\n\nHollis sighed, nibbling her toast. Maybe in twenty-five years she could meet life the way Stella did. Yes, on her silver wedding day maybe she wouldn't be selfish and petty and jealous of little things. But she was afraid to think about it; she was terribly afraid there wouldn't even be an anniversary for her and Bill.\n\nThe next day Hollis met Peg Stewart at Frankens for luncheon. Dear old Peg, blond and dashing, a little plumper since Tom, Jr., had arrived, but just the same old Peg, envious and gossipy but lovable, too.\n\"So Stella and Ted have been married twenty-five years,\" she rattled on. \"That is something. Oh oh, there's Ted now with his office crowd.\" Hollis followed Peg's eyes, blinked, started from her chair, then sat back staring at Ted Martin seated with a jolly crowd at a table across the room. A smart-looking girl with slick blond hair was telling him something very funny because Ted was laughing.\n\nHollis could feel prickly little darts racing up her spine. \"He should've brought Stella,\" she said in a tight, aching voice. Peg said, one eyebrow a half-inch above the other: \"Believe me, Tom and I would have a good tiff if he left me out even if it was the office crowd.\" Hollis puckered her lovely brows. \"How can he treat Stella like this? And the day before their silver anniversary! But then, she doesn't know about it.\" Peg said: \"Look, Holly, I'm going to call her right this minute,...\" Hollis bristled. \"You can't! You can't hurt Stella like that!\" \"Oh, can't I? Listen, sugar, someone should have spunk enough to tell Stella she's being neglected!\" Peg had already started toward the telephone and Hollis knew she might as well try to stop the thunder. Resentment was a burning ache in her throat as she hurried from the restaurant alone. She was heartsick and tired of trying to understand life and people. It was a man's world no doubt of that! And Bill and Ted were just alike!\n\nLEARN OF LOVE\n\nShe walked the streets all afternoon, postponing the eventual showdown with Stella. Of course Peg would tell her Hollis had seen Ted, too. She couldn't pretend she didn't know about it. Her heart was falling like a hammer as she opened the door of the Martin's house at five o'clock. She hesitated in the hallway. Stella was probably in her own room crying her heart out. But no, that was the whir of the mixmaster in the kitchen and Stella's tinkling voice singing above it. Hollis was dizzy with relief. Then Peg hadn't called her after all! \"Hi,\" Stella called. \"Come on in. I'm making candy for the boys—some for your Bill, too. We don't want him to think we've forgotten him, do we?\" Hollis leaned against the door frame. She couldn't breathe. Bill had forgotten her, of course. He hadn't phoned or written or even thought about her. The stubborn mule! Stella looked at her. \"Say, baby, you look all in. Here sit down—quick!\" She pushed a chair under Hollis. \"T thought you'd be home earlier,\" she went on. \"Peg said you ran out on her at noon.\" Slowly Hollis realized what Stella was saying. Peg had called her! Her hand trembled around the glass of water Stella handed to her and then suddenly she burst into tears against Stella's warm breast. Stella held her in a tight little hug, smoothing her hair tenderly. \"T hate men!\" Hollis sobbed. \"They're mean and selfish and just try to hurt us!\" 589\n\n\"Don't think that way, pet,\" Stella was saying. \"And don't let what Peg said upset you. I know it doesn't look well for Ted to lunch with his office crowd all the time. At first I thought I couldn't stand it we quarreled about it many times, but every couple does that at some time or other. I learned better after while. I'm sure now that the crowd you saw today can't take Ted away from me. Yes, I know,\" she held up her hand as Hollis started to speak, \"you're going to tell me what fun they were having, how cute the office girl is; but listen, honey, we have to trust a little more and have a little more faith in ourselves. I know Ted loves his home and I know he loves me, so I'm not worrying.\" \"You're not even human,\" Hollis interrupted, dabbing her eyes indignantly. \"I can't stand Bill to be late or eat out with office crowds—I'm not an angel like you are!\" Stella's eyes narrowed, her nostrils quivered, and for one tiny instant fire flickered in her eyes. \"I haven't always been an angel,\" she answered quietly. \"It's taken me twenty-five years to learn how working overtime, including Sundays. Listen, dear, it's like this, love is the secret. If you love a man enough you won't run out on your job and your job is to make a go of it. We can't let these little things get us down every day demands our very best....\"\n\nHOLLIS couldn't listen any longer. She excused herself, explaining she didn't want dinner because she'd had so much luncheon, and hurried up to her room. Stella's words kept repeating themselves, like the rhythm of her heart \"love is the secret\" \"these little things.\" How could she call it a little thing when Ted neglected her like this? If that was the kind of treatment that added up to a silver wedding day then Hollis didn't want one, even if she was so lonely for Bill and sick about everything that she cried herself to sleep. But she hurried down to breakfast the next morning, eager to see if Stella had been putting on an act the night before. She'd be able to tell when she saw her with Ted. They were at the breakfast table, leaning close together reading a letter. Hollis could hear Stella's voice and she felt the rich happiness in it. Ted's arm was around her shoulders and his fingers toyed lovingly with her dark hair as she read aloud in her sweet rushing way:\n\n\"Now you know how Bud and I feel about you, Mom and Dad,\n\nAnd your silver wedding day.\n\nProud, that's the word for it, and grateful, too. Both of us know it hasn't been easy for either of you. I can remember times when I wondered how Mom put up with you, Dad, but she always forgave you. And I can also remember a few times when Mom was plenty unreasonable and blew her top over some crazy little thing that shouldn't have mattered at all. But I'm glad she always came back smiling, ready to try again. Yes, we are the luckiest guys in the world to have a couple of parents like you. God bless you both on your wedding day and thanks for being like you are.\n\nThanks again for everything.\"\n\nHollis's breath caught inside her and she bit her trembling lip as she hurried back upstairs. She kept remembering the little shining glints in Stella's eyes. When she came back down an hour later, Stella had gone to do some last minute shopping and Ted was cutting the lawn. She took some toast and milk and went out to the porch swing; she watched his tall figure bent over a mower, a lock of his dark hair bouncing before his eyes, his face reddened by the sun.\n\n\"Hello, Holly,\" he called, dropping the handle and mopping his face. \"Tough work for an old man. Whew!\" He sat down in the swing beside her. \"I want everything slicked up around here for the reception tonight guess I better trim that hedge, too,\" he added, squinting at it.\n\n\"Is today that important to you, Ted?\" Hollis asked, a little edge to her voice and her eyes sardonic as she looked at him. \"I mean does a silver wedding day mean as much to you as it does to Stella?\"\n\nHe looked down at her, his heavy brows puckered together.\n\n\"You're a funny kid,\" he said, studying her intently. \"Of course it means as much to me maybe more. Here, wait a minute.\" He dashed into the garage, was gone a minute, then came back grinning like a kid with a big balloon. \"Look at this,\" he beamed, \"I've kept it hidden in the garage so Stella wouldn't see it until tonight.\" Hollis looked a long time at the chest of shining silver and watched Ted as he turned each piece for her inspection. \"Sterling!\" he said, and the word was music on his lips. \"The very best. For Stella.\" Hollis felt a great hot lump in her throat as he went on talking eagerly. \"I've been paying for it a year. It was tough with the boys in school but I did extra work and made a little overtime. Stella has always wanted a set like this. I've watched her looking at advertisements in the magazines. I can hardly wait to give it to her—she's earned it a million times over.\"\nHis voice stumbled, and Hollis noticed a little pulse quiver in his throat.\n\"It's beautiful, Ted,\" she whispered, her heart very quiet. \"She'll love it—I'm sure. . . .\" Then she left him sitting there staring after her.\nThe reception was an informal, friendly affair, and Stella was a dream in blue velvet, standing with Ted before the white mantel, her arm in his, greeting old friends with a radiant happiness as though it hadn't been any trick at all to live twenty-five years with him, the darling!\nAnd when Peg came, flamboyant, inquisitive Peg, bristling with curiosity to see how a wife acted on her silver wedding day, Stella was charming and poised as a calm lily.\n\"You're sweet!\" she said, hugging Peg as though she didn't even remember how unhappy Peg had tried to make her feel yesterday. \"I wish you had waited for Bud or Dick.\"\nPeg tossed her head, laughing as she poked her finger at Ted. \"Then this old meanie would have been my father-in-law. Ouch! I couldn't take it, Stella.\"\nAnd Stella laughed, too, as if they shared a side-splitting secret.\nHollis watching from the dining room where she was pouring punch, noticed that Ted was different than he had been at Franken's yesterday.\nHis rakish grin had sobered to a tender smile and the twinkle in his eyes was a steady glowing light as he looked at Stella. Hollis realized, with a catchy little sob, that Stella had earned that look and it hadn't been easy. Dear, wonderful Stella! Hollis could feel the tears burning hot in her eyes as she turned away and ran up to her room.\nOnce inside she shut the door and leaned back heavily against it. She wanted a silver wedding day, too, and she wanted it with Bill. He was a thousand times more wonderful than anyone else in the world, with his sandy hair and his big, easy shoulders and that firm, stubborn mouth.\nShe knew now that a silver wedding day, like everything else that is good in life, has to be earned and someday—oh, maybe someday—Bill would look at her the way Ted had looked at Stella tonight; as though she meant everything that was true and lovely and worth working for.\nResolutely, her chin steady and determined, she went to the telephone and dialed her home number. And when Bill answered, his voice husky with sleep, she said softly: \"Hello, Bill. I've learned—the secret. I want you to know. . . .\"\nThere was a breathless little pause. She could imagine Bill's mouth breaking into a wide grin. \"That's wonderful, honey. Wanta tell me the secret?\" His voice was eager—and wistful.\n\"I'll tell you when I get home,\" she answered, knowing deep in her heart that home would always be in Bill's arms.\n\nSixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, September 1, and September 15, 1888 \"For THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ZION AND THE RIGHTS OF THE Women oF ALL NATIONS\" INCIDENTS OF TRAVEL: In conversation with Prest.

In Mrs. Horne's railway journey from Salt Lake City to New York she met with quite a number of people who were interested in Utah matters, the people, the institutions, etc. Elder R. S. Horne, her son, who accompanied her, also conversed with several learned gentlemen who desired information upon the subject of Mormonism and who seemed pleased with whatever items were imparted to them.\n\nFROM HOME\nWould that every tired heart now in exile\nCould be cheered to-day as mine,\nWith a token of love from loved ones,\nThat would give such love divine.\nBut they cannot, so God grant that blossoms\nWherever they dwell may bloom,\nAnd to comfort, cheer and bless them,\nBe laden with \"dear home\" perfume.\n\nE.

Kimball addressed the meeting. She spoke of her recent visit to San Francisco and other parts of California, and the ideas people outside entertained of our people; described an interesting visit to a celebrated church, and remarked that her visit had enlarged her charity for those who were not of our faith.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS\nThe tight coat-sleeve is entirely abandoned in favor of the sleeve of puffs and plaits. A new bangle is made of gold wire in the shape of an arrow which curves around the arm. Outside pockets will be worn with fall gowns. As they are convenient and can be made ornamental, they will be heartily welcome. Bows of plaited braid appear at the foot of the skirt in all new gowns. They are well received as they look well and save the dress from wear. Realism permeates all arts even the milliners. The latest decoration for bonnets is a bunch of red clover blossoms or thistle heads.\n\nNOTES AND NEWS: Charles Lamb's grave at Edmonton is sadly neglected. The simple slab of limestone which marks the spot is nearly hidden with weeds and grasses. The world of art owes Princess Torrearsa a great debt for the preservation of the famous collection of Greek vases brought together by the late archaeologist Serradifaleo. Through her efforts, the collection has been placed in the museum of Palermo, at Sicily, where it will be doubtless kept for all time.\n\nPage 592\nWoman's Sphere Ramona W.

It recognizes the great need in America for young people to come to marriage with homemaking skills well developed, and with the maturity and understanding necessary to create a home and a family.\n\nMISS BLANCHE FERRE, teacher at Central School, Brigham City, Utah, won the $1,200 prize for the nation's best elementary-grade teacher in the radio program contest of the \"Quiz Kids.\" Her former pupil, Scott Crower, 8, who wrote the letter that elected her, said that she came early every morning to help a slow pupil learn to read and that \"she was nice to all of us, not just a few.\"\n\nUTAH has a number of women in their \"gay nineties\" and even beyond. The oldest woman of the State is Mrs. Sarah Ann Gibboney of Duchesne, 101 on July 24; Mrs. Lydia Baker, Logan, is 100; Mrs. Ann C. Milne, Salt Lake, will be 100 on October 27; Mrs. Mary S. Sleater and Mrs. Elizabeth Glover, oldest identical twins in the United States are Utah-reared pioneer women, Mrs. Mary Smith of San Leandro, California, and Mrs. Margaret Lamb of Farmington, Utah. At 99 they are still sometimes mistaken for each other. Mrs. Augusta Winters Grant, widow of the late President Heber J. Grant, is 92. In the past few months death has come to Mrs. Alice Wright Seaman of Cedar, 99; Mrs. Mary Louise Folsom Brown, 92; and Mrs. Calletune Callister Hatton of Fillmore, who lacked three days of being 98.\n\nAMERICAN girls received some high school instruction for the first time in 1826, in Boston. But there were too many applicants for the limited budget, so two years later the school was closed, the Mayor declaring: \"No city could stand the expense.\" Twenty-six years later, 1854, the first (genuine) high school for girls was founded in America. That, too, was in Boston—the Girls' High School.\n\nPage 593\nEDITORIAL SEPTEMBER 1948 VOL. 35 No. 9\n\nThe Family Hour\nWe live for time and for eternity.... This family organization being a unit in the great and perfect organization of God's work, and all destined to continue throughout time and eternity (Gospel Doctrine, page 348).\n\nIn order to help cement eternal family ties, a responsibility has been placed by the General Authorities upon every Relief Society mother to the end that she, under the direction of her husband, will see that a Family Hour is regularly observed in her family circle. Last year Relief Society visiting teachers left in every Latter-day Saint home a pamphlet which set forth the purpose and suggestions for holding the Family Hour. Some months have passed since the inauguration of this program and the responsibility that Relief Society members have for the success of the Family Hour is being re-emphasized. Many families have already heeded this call and are now reaping the blessings to be gained from the holding of the Family Hour in their respective families. However, there are still some families which, for one reason or another, have not yet made the Family Hour an integral part of their family life.\n\nIt would be an ideal practice for every young couple, very soon after their marriage, to establish their own Family Hour. It would be a time for them to read and study the scriptures together, to discuss family problems as they arise and solve them in harmony with gospel principles. Very valuable lessons for marriage could be learned from reading instructions on marriage and family life which have been given by Church leaders. Enjoying recreation together should also form a part of their Family Hour, and not be overlooked.\n\nAs children bless the union of such a couple, a Family Hour would already be well established in their home and the procedure might then be modified to suit the tastes of children of the varying age groups, all to the end that the family would feel itself a unit and sense its obligation to progress as a unit here and hereafter. The position of the husband as the head of the family should always be recognized in any such gathering.\n\nFor a newly married couple or a family in which the children are all small, the problems connected with the establishment of a Family Hour are negligible. The mother of children in the adolescent age group, however, may find some obstacles to overcome since the young people have probably become so accustomed to being left to their own pleasures and desires that they may resent giving up some activity in order to devote the time to be together as a family. Under these circumstances, of course, the mother's first concern THE FAMILY HOUR would be to enlist the support of her husband in establishing a Family Hour. Since the family is always present at dinner time, the dinner hour might be a good time at which to begin a Family Hour. Games which proceed along with the dinner catch the interest of teen-agers. 'To help build family solidarity the father might give a short talk, commending individual members for particular traits and giving encouragement on the means of overcoming faults. The father might also announce the time decided upon for holding the Family Hour thereafter. Following the initial observance, Mother, as the instigator, may prepare special light refreshments and plan activities behind the scenes of as varied a nature as necessary to make the 595 Family Hour a time of pleasurable enjoyment. The children may take turns in planning programs and different-type activities since the more the active interest of each member of the family is aroused, the more successful will be the observances. When one recalls the blessings promised to a family which faithfully holds a Family Hour, every Relief Society mother should resolve to enlist the support of her husband in instituting such an observance in her own family. Only thus can Relief Society fulfill the call which has been placed upon it by the Church. The regular holding of a Family Hour, moreover, will aid parents in fulfilling the obligation of parenthood which the Lord has placed upon them.\n\nM. C. S.\nAll Relief Society Members Invited to Thursday September 30th Sessions of the Annual General Relief Society Conference\nVERY Relief Society member is invited to attend the two sessions of the annual general Relief Society conference to be held in the Tabernacle on September 30, Thursday morning from 10 to 12 and Thursday afternoon from 2 to 4. The entire proceedings of the morning meeting will be devoted to the recognition of the completion of the Relief Society Building Fund. Each stake and mission achieving 100% of its quota will have an official representative seated in a reserved section wearing a band bearing the name of the respective stake or mission. A special feature will be the rendition by the Singing Mothers of a song written especially for this occasion. The afternoon session will be a time of rejoicing and the voicing of gratitude and thanksgiving for blessings enjoyed by Relief Society members everywhere. President George Albert Smith and President Spafford will speak at the afternoon session. It is the hope of the general board that the Tabernacle will overflow with great numbers of the sisters who have so unselfishly worked to donate to the great Relief Society Building Fund. It will be an epoch-making conference and one which will live long in the annals of Relief Society.\n\nEMILY H. BENNETT\nFirst Counselor\nBERTHA S. READER\nPresident\nLARUE C. LONGDEN\nSecond Counselor\n\nRelief Society Congratulates Newly Appointed Y.W.M.I.A. Presidency\nRELIEF Society members in all the stakes and missions of the Church extend congratulations and best wishes to the new officers of our sister organization, the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association. Sister Bertha Stone Reeder, the newly appointed president, has selected as her counselors Emily Higgs Bennett and LaRue Can Longden. These women are all outstanding leaders, gifted, faithful, enthusiastic, and devoted to the welfare of the young women of the Church. Sister Reeder, the mother of two sons and a daughter, is a woman of great personal charm. She recently returned from New England, where her husband, Judge William H. Reeder, Jr., was mission president and Sister Reeder presided over the women's auxiliaries. As an organization the Relief Society feels particularly proud of this dear sister whose loyal efforts in the mission field brought many isolated organizations into close harmony with the ideals and opportunities of Relief Society. She has now been called to a position of even greater responsibility where her loving influence will help to develop the \"mutual\" girls into capable and loyal Relief Society members for tomorrow.\n\nSister Bennett, a truly ideal Latter-day Saint woman, is the wife of Harold H. Bennett and the mother of eight children. Two sons recently left for the mission field. Emily Bennett has many artistic gifts, including writing and music. Her radiant personality, her devotion to the gospel, her understanding and comradeship with young people, are qualities which will greatly influence the young women of the Church.\n\nThe new second counselor, Sister Longden, has been an active leader in Church auxiliaries ever since she was appointed stake Sunday School secretary at the age of sixteen. She has written many beautiful plays and pageants and is well known for her book and play reviews, which have been of much cultural value in her community, particularly for groups of \"mutual\" girls. Sister Longden and her husband, John Longden, a devoted Church worker, have two lovely daughters. The sweet and gracious influence of this wife and mother will now be further extended to include all the daughters of Zion.\n\nAs Relief Society women, we wish also to extend our love and appreciation to the retiring presidency, Lucy Grant Cannon, Verna W. Goddard, and Lucy T. Andersen. Theirs has been a service of untiring devotion, of spiritual inspiration, and most gracious leadership. May their future endeavors be blessed with much happiness and the continued enjoyment of the gifts of the gospel.\n\nSelf Defense\nAnna Prince Redd\n\nI take the highway or the air\nWhen I, with urgent feet, must see\nShops and cities—anywhere.\nJust to lose myself from me.\nBut when my heart again is still,\nI seek the trail, the musky loam.\nThe woodfolk, whispering, until\nA lighted window brings me home.\n\nAntics\nMary Pack Tiiplett\n\nLittle regimented ant!\nWith what amazing skill\nYou shovel out your tunnels\nAnd lift a sheltering hill.\nWe respect your talent\nTo build and colonize;\nYou surely show rare intellect\nFor one of your small size.\nYet just one aberration\nMarks you the rankest sinner;\nYou make your uninvited way\nTo every picnic dinner.\n\nNotes to the Field Payments for Wheat Interest\n\nThis year, for the first time, checks for wheat interest for all amounts of five cents or over have been sent by the Presiding Bishop's office to ward bishops for delivery to ward Relief Society presidents. Where wheat interest amounts are less than five cents, no payment will be made because of impracticability. Heretofore, postage stamps for wheat interest amounting to less than $1.00 have been sent to ward Relief Society presidents, but this practice has been discontinued.\n\nChecks should be cashed promptly and, in accordance with instructions in a letter to stake Relief Society presidents dated November 14, 1947, the wheat interest should be placed in the general fund and used as are any other general funds of the society.\n\nAnnual General Relief Society Conference September 29 and 30, 1948, PLANS are well underway for the annual general relief Society conference to be held on Wednesday and Thursday, September 29 and 30, 1948, immediately preceding the Church semi-annual general conference. The plan for the Relief Society general conference calls for a morning officers meeting in the Assembly Hall for stake board members on Wednesday, with departmental meetings to be held simultaneously in the afternoon. A reception to which stake board members and mission Relief Society presidents are invited will be held in the evening at the Hotel Utah. Both meetings on Thursday will convene in the Tabernacle and be open to the general public. The morning session from 10 a.m. to 12 noon will feature the conclusion of the Relief Society Building Fund program. It is expected that an official representative of every stake and mission achieving 100% or more of its Building Fund quota will be present and recognition given them. Gold bands to be worn by the official representatives, lettered with the name of the stake or mission, will be given the official representatives at nine o'clock in the Tabernacle on Thursday morning. The conference will be a time of rejoicing to the sisters everywhere.\n\nThe afternoon session in the Tabernacle will be addressed by members of the General Authorities and Relief Society general board members. This conference will be remembered as one of the most memorable occasions in the history of Relief Society, and it is the earnest hope of the general board that great numbers of Relief Society members from far away as well as nearby may be in attendance.\n\nStake presidents are requested to have their ward presidents announce the conference at the Relief Society summer meetings.\n\nPage 598\n\nThe Russells Did Not Go to Church\nChapter 2 Edith Russell\nSynopsis: The Russells, who live on the edge of the Haworth moors in England, do not go to church. However, the daughter Edith almost unconsciously seeks a religious faith to satisfy her spiritual longing. She decides to attend a meeting in the nearby church.\n\nTHE vicarage was a large, grim house setting its back against the wide, bleak vista of the Haworth moors. The door boasted no bell, but a great iron knocker. It was wet and chilly in my hand and I let it fall with a harsh metallic thud which seemed to place an intolerable weight upon my spirits. It seemed ages had elapsed before the door was opened and the thin, old face of a woman appeared to inquire my business.\n\n\"The Reverend Pratt asked me to come to a meeting of the new churchworkers' guild, tonight,\" I told her.\n\nHurriedly she opened the door wide enough to admit me. \"Cum in! Cum in! afore all of us freeze to death!\" I stepped inside. I heard the door close dully behind me and the old woman led the way down a dark, stone-flagged hall, to a room at the furthest end, the door of which she thrust open to announce: \"A young leddy fer't meating.\"\n\nI saw a group of perhaps a dozen individuals all sitting within the feeble glow of an oil lamp, all manifestly chilled by the gusty windswept night and the patent inadequacy of a small coal fire smoldering in the grate. I recognized two of the men as neighboring farmers and a large woman with a walking cane as a \"ruling hand\" in the village. No one spoke to me as I entered. Everyone was apparently awaiting the arrival of the vicar and the only sensation I seemed to evoke was one of general disappointment.\n\nThe reverend gentleman was late. One of the farmers took out his watch—a great silver timepiece with a sonorous tick—and consulted it grimly. \"Five an' twenty t'eight an' 't parson noan 'ere yit! Ahm noan barn ta wait much longer.\" This he uttered in tones implying a serious threat. No one else spoke.\n\nIt needed but five minutes to eight o'clock when the outside door clanged again and a moment later, an icy draught blew a somewhat disheveled parson into the room. His perfectly white hair was wet and windblown as though he had walked far without a hat. His greetings were unexpectedly warm, effusive, almost, and after the previous frigidity manifest in the room, a trifle embarrassing. He walked briskly about the room, rubbing his hands, belatedly seeing to everyone's comfort, remembering everyone's name and calling each by it.\n\nHe was glad I had kept my promise to come. I thanked him for his courtesy. I was waiting to see what in him the villagers had stoned.\n\nHE opened the meeting with a prayer. It was a fine, eloquent speech and it made me recollect that the man who offered it was something of a scholar; that he quoted Sassoon frequently from the pulpit and that he was writing an autobiography of the Brontes. I thought he was not unlike the Reverend Patrick Bronte, himself the same unrelenting eyes and thin mouth.\n\nHe finished his address to the Almighty with a request that Hannah Shuttleworth of Riddings Farm should be brought, by the whisperings of the Spirit, to realize her unworthiness to belong to St. Matthews since the birth of her illegitimate child, and thus save him, Parson Pratt, the necessity for dismissing her from the congregation.\n\nI opened my eyes, prematurely, at this and found that everyone else, with the exception of Parson Pratt, had ceased trying to keep his closed long ago. They were looking at the devout gentleman, still in prayerful communion, with undisguised admiration. The parson's command of words impressed them visibly.\n\nThe object of our meeting had been the organization of a churchworkers' guild. The church needed workers, and so did Mr. Pratt, but he had a great respect for organization. There must be a leader and someone who could write letters and make tea. It was gently hinted, too, that there must also be a few members in such an organization who had \"long stockings\" or a mattress or some other personal hiding place where the rich and eccentric keep their inheritances.\n\n\"The whole thing must be efficiently run in the approved manner if it were to be a success,\" he answered. There must, of course, be a unity of feeling and purpose among the members. Everyone must lend his whole heart and soul to this first great project of the guild, which was the cleaning out and moral purging of St. Matthews.\n\n\"I'm sure you will all agree with me that it is in the best interests of the church,\" he answered referring to the afore-mentioned Hannah, \"that such people should be disfellowshipped with all possible speed.\"\n\n\"Why don't yer turn 'er out, Vicar?\" a woman's voice demanded. \"Why doan't yer insult 'er an' let 'er knaw she's noan wanted?\"\n\n\"I might yet, Mrs. Drake,\" he answered.\n\nI might yet,\" Mr. Pratt said. A cold wind blew from the hall under the door at my feet and outside the great door swung a moment then clanged shut, causing the whole house to shudder. With ridiculous optimism it flashed across my mind that God had come; that he wouldn't stand for it a moment longer and had come to justify himself. I waited, one minute, two minutes but nothing happened; nothing except a voice, curiously like my own, voicing an aching, throbbing protest I thought I never could utter. \"Mr. Pratt!\" He was arrested in his perambulations. He stood looking down upon me, curious. \"Mr. Pratt,\" I plunged, desperately, \"I don't know anything about Christianity; lots of people don't. THE RUSSELLS DID NOT GO TO CHURCH but, but, supposing some poor unhappy soul were looking for Jesus and had been standing outside this room tonight, listening to all this, do you think it would have been any inducement for him to come in?\" I knew it was appallingly weak, but I had an aching lump in my breast which pumped determination, a queer feeling of love, and the instinct to fight and give battle into every vein in my body. A dozen pairs of eyes focused themselves upon me. \"I fear you have misunderstood me, Miss Russell,\" he replied, icily. \"It is obvious that you are not aware of the character of some of these villagers. Nothing is sacred to them—neither the ornaments of the altar nor my person. Are you aware that one of them actually stole a candlestick from off the Easter altar?\" I felt a fleeting surprise that this man had evidently never appreciated Hugo's Les Miserables. Otherwise, he would not have afforded me such an excellent opportunity to quote the classic example of the Bishop and Jean Val Jean. \"The Bishop forgave Val Jean; made him a present of the candlesticks which he had stolen and brought another soul to God. You see,\" I told the furious vicar, \"Val Jean could resist anything—cruelty, injustice, the beastliness of the galleys—anything at all, except love.\" The villagers are rough and many of them are ignorant,\" I said, \"but they are not bad. They are like children who do not understand; who need to be shown. You do not love them, Parson Pratt. You have never even tried to understand them. 601 You despise their ignorance, you don't pity it or try to change it. Hannah Shuttleworth is not a wicked woman; she simply doesn't know any better and doesn't care to know because the people who have tried to teach her despised her first—despised her and condemned her. Christ forgave the woman who had sinned, he did not condemn her.\" I was awfully near to tears and I swallowed desperately and blew my nose. \"Miss Russell!\" The vicar's voice was bland again. \"I am afraid you are too sentimental. You make Christianity sound like a love story....\" \"It is a love story, Mr. Pratt,\" I broke in, urgently, \"The greatest ever told.\" THE Reverend Pratt ignored the interruption and surveyed me and the group of startled parishioners with a look depicting an attitude of magnificent fairness. \"I can see you mean well,\" he conceded, generously. \"You wish to serve God. But er, not here. You should give your talents to a city poor law mission. You would, I am sure, be very welcome there.\" The inference was obvious. A sense of defeat swept over me as I remembered the country folk of the village, their clean, old-fashioned homes, their uncultivated voices, their superstitions. They believed in God, but they didn't understand Sassoon. Looking into the faces of the now silent group, I waited for some feeling of bitterness to well up in my heart. But it didn't come. 602 Instead, all I was aware of was the unutterable pathos and tragedy of it all. I wondered what the world would be like if all the clever people could just learn to be kind. And it was suddenly borne upon me that God was here, after all. He must have slipped in once when the door clanged. I could not doubt it though I tried. His voice was in my ears; his love was swelling in my heart; the vision of him was in my eyes. \"You understand, Miss Russell,\" Mr. Pratt was continuing, \"we cannot ask you now to be a member of the guild after tonight. We must have unity of thought and purpose.\" I rose to my feet. A swift new joy surged through me—something exquisite I had not known before. I said: \"Of course, I understand....\" The great heavy door of the vicarage fell shut behind me as I went out into the night. A sense of peace enveloped me. The wind from the moors had blown the clouds into stormy battlements above me. God was waiting. (To be concluded) WONDERING YEARS Grace Sayre Time rests her hand; I feel the soft caress Of fingers laid upon me, as to bless The moment and the mood, while I may stand With head bowed to the brief touch of time's hand. Time lifts her hand and bids me look around To find myself released, my days unbound; All the dread that swept my wondering years Is left to time's vast urn of unshed tears. BUTTON MAGIC Marijane Morris The buttons that my mother left are mine. They hold enchanted, carefree hours of play. I know the secrets of each brave design  They are my mother's life in resume. These pearls once gleamed upon her wedding dress, She'd say, a smile remaining on her face. These baby buttons speak of blessedness And love that found its home the perfect place. Two from my father's shirt, ungainly pair; This odd one was a hero in my eyes; These wide ones stretched on winter underwear, All played my childish games in some disguise. Swift time can never quite escape from me, Because my mother's buttons hold the key. FOOD PRESERVATION Bernice Stookey Linford Thou shalt be diligent in preserving what thou hast, that thou mayest be a wise steward; for it is the free gift of the Lord thy God, and thou art his steward (D. & C. 136:27). ANNING IS STILL THE MOST WIDELY USED FORM OF FOOD PRESERVATION BOTH IN THE HOME KITCHEN AND IN COMMERCIAL FACTORIES. Yet each year many persons die from food poisoning as a result of poor canning methods due to carelessness or misunderstanding. Because the American people depend so much on canned products for their daily food, the United States Department of Agriculture has prepared for distribution a great variety of canning and other food preservation bulletins. The utmost care has been taken by specialists in testing and assembling this authentic material. Complete step-by-step directions and illustrations are included, which make canning safe and simple even for the most inexperienced. Single copies of these bulletins are free and may be obtained by contacting county extension agents or by writing the Office of Information, United States Department of Agriculture. Available publications are listed at the end of this article.\n\nYour family needs will determine the specific bulletins you send for all are authentic and practical. Freezer lockers and home freezers are available to many. Frozen foods, if the best quality food is selected and proper methods used, are almost the equal of fresh foods. They may be of even better quality than fresh foods which have been shipped great distances and have become withered by exposure to heat and air. Speed and method of preparation from butchering and garden to quick freeze, quality of product, variety, and stage of maturity are all illustrated and explained in the bulletins on freezing listed, as are proper packaging and temperatures. Thawing and cooking methods are also given.\n\nSalting and brining of meats and vegetables are very practical in rural areas where there is no electricity. Pork, corned beef, and fish are especially good salted or sugarcured. Dill pickles, spiced cucumbers, sauerkraut, green beans, corn, and various greens keep well and lose very little of their vitamins or mineral content if properly salted.\n\nOur friends in Europe and countries where there is little or no refrigeration, where fuel and equipment for canning are scarce and storage space limited, would appreciate bulletins giving methods of drying fruits and salting and drying meats, fish, and vegetables. These preserved products take little space for storage, are high in minerals and vitamins, and add to the year-round calcium supply so necessary to health.\n\nStone crocks or jars or clean wooden kegs (which do not have wood odor) can be used for salting, and simple equipment is illustrated in the drying bulletins. Surplus eggs, too, should be preserved in water glass. Water glass (or sodium silicate solution) can be purchased in quart or gallon jars at any drug store. Use clean, unwashed fresh eggs. Put them into glass or stone jars or pickle kegs. Prepare the water glass solution as directed on the container.\n\nIf the natural protective film on eggs is removed by water or sandpaper, the shell becomes porous and the liquid is absorbed through the shell. The water glass solution forms a sealing film on the eggshell. If stored in a cool place, eggs will keep for months. There is no loss of vitamins or food value. In fact, eggs produced during the season of the year when chickens feed on green grass will contain more vitamins than winter-produced eggs, unless the hens are fed vitamin fortified feed.\n\nOne homemaker saved $45 in one season by buying fresh eggs in the spring when they were low in price and large end expansion, or when heated, Proper storage of foods is necessary. Canned foods should be stored where it is cool and dark. Store dried foods in insect-tight, covered, glass, tin, or any moisture-proof containers. If there is any danger of the products being contaminated by insects during drying, they should be heated from twenty to thirty minutes in a slow oven (165 F) before being put in containers, so that any eggs laid by the insects will be destroyed.\n\nFrozen vegetables are best cooked without thawing. Frozen meats, poultry, and game should be thawed at room temperature in the package as frozen so there will be no exposure to air until unwrapped to cook. Fats, as pork, beef, mutton, and poultry may be tenderized at low temperature and poured hot into hot, clean containers then sealed airtight. Hot fat is of higher temperature. Fat thus prepared and sealed will stay fresh from five to eight years if kept in a cool, dark place.\n\nLight destroys the vitamins in milk; therefore, milk should be kept where it is cool and dark. It should be placed in the refrigerator, cellar, or cooler as soon as possible after it is milked or delivered. If you have no refrigerator, bottled milk may be kept cool by wrapping it in newspapers wrung out of cold water and then wrapping a dry paper for extra insulation around the outside.\n\nLettuce and other fresh vegetables and fruits will keep fresh and crisp for several days by being wrapped first in damp paper, then tightly wrapped with ordinary newspaper. Tomatoes, squash, cucumbers, and other vine-produced vegetables will keep for weeks late in the fall if packed in dry sand. Cabbages, harvested in the fall, may be kept fresh until spring by packing them with the heads down in a trench dug in the garden. Pull up the cabbage plants by the roots and do not trim off the outer leaves of the roots. Dig a trench about eighteen inches deep in the garden; place the cabbages head down, roots up, and fill the trench in with dirt. If the cabbage should freeze, thaw it in cold water before cooking. It will taste like new cabbage.\n\nCabbage, Brussels sprouts, and other raw salad greens furnish the same protective vitamins as tomatoes, oranges, and grapefruit.\n\nRoot vegetables, as turnips, carrots, rutabagas, beets, potatoes, etc., keep for months in small garden pits. A pit large enough to hold the vegetables may be dug in the garden. Place boards or straw over the top as insulation, then cover the top with soil, leaving a small space for ventilation. Cover carefully again each time after opening the pit to prevent freezing of the remaining vegetables.\n\nGarden seeds and practical information on preservation would be useful for sending also to families in Europe. Pitted, dried, and salted vegetables would insure year-round fresh food. Dried seeds, beans, peas, and whole grain cereals, with their life-producing germs, build tissue, bone, and blood. They supply the vitamins so necessary for the stability of the entire nervous system. Seeds could be raised in the home garden, gathered, and saved from year to year for replanting.\n\n\"Man is that he might have joy.\" Working in the soil, watching the miracle of life spring from planted seeds, anticipating maturity, gathering, sharing, and storing the harvest bring pride of achievement. These activities build new life—life abundant, with health and peace by the body, mind, and soul.\n\nThe following bulletins may be obtained from county extension agents or by writing to the Office of Information, United States Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C.\nHome Canning of Fruits and Vegetables—AIS-64\nHome Canning of Meat—AWI-119\nHome Freezing of Fruits and Vegetables—AIS-48\nPickle and Relish Recipes—AWI-103\nHomemade Jellies, Jams, and Preserves—FB-1800\nPreparation of Vegetables by Salting or Brining—FB-1932\nHome Storage of Vegetables and Fruits—AWI-119\nFreezing Meat and Poultry Products for Home Use—AWI-75\nBeef on the Farm—Slaughtering, Cutting, Curing—FB-1415\nPork on the Farm—Killing, Curing and Canning—FB-1186\nLamb and Mutton on the Farm—FB-1367\nCuring Pork—Country Style—AWI-106\nPoultry Cookings—FB-1888\nMeat for Thrifty Meals—FB-1958\n\nA MATTER OF VIEWPOINT\nOlive C.

Hugh and Kathleen are married on board the ship. While in Iowa preparing for the handcart journey across the plains, Margaret tells Mother Mac she is in love with Andrew, and Kathleen tells the two women she is expecting a baby. While crossing the plains Andrew is lost in a blizzard, but is rescued by Margaret. She later leaves the Mac party and goes to Tooele to live. The Macs get settled in Zion. Kathleen and Hugh have a son and name him Mac Coleman Shand. Andrew begins farming and saving money to bring Jane over from Scotland.\n\nTHE crop was everything that Andrew had hoped it would be—many bushels of glowing, golden grain. \"A wonderful combination,\" the young man observed, \"the rich fertile soil of the bottoms, the gentle rains from heaven, Brother Hunter to plan and to organize, Brother Rumgay to do the work.\" As Andrew gazed at the wonder of the harvest, he felt the thrill of security pulling and tugging at his heartstrings. In King's Kettle he had led a day-to-day existence, working from sunrise till sunset for an amount that could barely keep body and soul together.\n\nThe wheat was wealth, great wealth, and although the young man knew that most of it must go for Jane's emigration, there would be many more summers and many more harvests. The milling company would buy his crop. They would give coal, flour, equipment, even sheep and cattle in exchange, but they had no money. He sold the grain, and waited to receive his pay in money.\n\nOnce again Andrew needed work. At this time of the year, the autumn, all of the men in the village were hauling their winter wood from the canyons. Andrew joined them and worked for weeks piling up winter fuel. He became acquainted with the loggers and learned about timbering. When the trees come down in the mountains, homes went up in the valley. Cities were built to the music of the swinging ax.\n\nAndrew wanted a home. He could cut down the trees and pay to have them hauled to the sawmill, with the logs and lumber. So he threw his ax over his shoulder, and went into the deep, silent forest to work and to dream of a home for Jane. The high mountains were exciting, inspiring. Each day he worked knee-deep in graceful, ornamental ferns, grasses, and flowers. At night the men gathered around a bonfire to talk and to listen to the music of the guitar and mandolin, singing early American songs.\n\nAt times there were storms, heavy rains, with flashes of lightning, and the deep roll of thunder through the high mountains. In clear weather the stars shone through a roof of glossy leaves. It was autumn. The leaves and cones were falling; soon they would be buried under the snow.\n\nEvery weekend Andrew went into town for provisions, and to attend church. One Sunday afternoon he was at Mother's, trying to describe to her the wonderful beauty of the hills. He told her of a very comforting lesson he had learned from the trees. While he worked, and at night in the bight light of the fire as it blazed and crackled in the clearings, he had studied the trees. They all seemed beautiful in their dignity and stateliness, perfect in design and structure.\n\nThen one day he had examined the trunk of the tree he was chopping and found it wasn't perfect at all, but very imperfect, revealing all the history of its life—accidents, storms, insects, and animals, even fire. The limbs and branches proved to be the same; some of them were even badly warped and twisted. He had been amazed that the trees were just as beautiful as before, but this time with perfections and imperfections.\n\nHe had thrown his shoulders back. There was hope for him. He would grow as tall and straight as possible, but now with the thought that the scars of his imperfections would not ruin the design of his Creator. \"It is a very comforting thought,\" Mother agreed. \"Andrew, my weaknesses have always worried me; they will continue to worry me. I will try to grow into the pattern God intended, with all my failings and shortcomings. It is the effort we put forth to grow tall and straight that fully as much as the results we obtain that counts. It puts strength into the roots.\"\n\nTime passed, and with its passing came the reward of hard work and labor. Every spring new acres were broken up and more grain planted. Every autumn Andrew went into the forest to cut down timber. Three years had been a long time to wait for pay day, but the money came through at last, and Andrew sent it on to King's Kettle.\n\nWhile he watched his growing treasure in the valley, the Macs and Hunter men finished the cabin. It looked like a palace. Log houses were comfortable, warm in winter and cool in the summer. He would not be able to get windows for awhile, but he had a big fireplace built in the east end—one of his very special dreams. Kathleen and Mother provided new rag carpets for the windows and rugs for the floor.\n\nEvening would come in time. Andrew Rumgay was a very happy man. One afternoon Hugh went out to the farm to release Andrew for a few hours from his work. It had been a long time since Andrew had been to Resplendence. A letter had been left at Mother MacKinlay's for him, and he hurried to town, hoping for word from Jane.\n\nThe letter was from King's Kettle, but it wasn't from Jane. He discovered it was from the president of the branch. \"Surely there is some mistake,\" Andrew said, holding the letter open in his hand. \"How could the president send such a message?\" He read it over and over. \"It says that Jane Allison was married some 608 months ago, and is living in Dumfermline.\"\n\nAndrew looked blankly at Mother Mac. \"How could such a mistake have been made? It can't be true!\" \"But, my son, if the branch president wrote it, then it must be true.\" Mother Mac knew it was useless to postpone this inevitable shock. She placed her hand on Andrew's shoulder.\n\nAndrew turned pale. He reached for Mother's rocker and sat down. \"The president would not hurt you, son,\" she said. \"It took Jane Allison to do that, and a fine job she's made of it. She might have been lady enough to have written herself.\" \"No, Mother, no!\" Andrew picked up his hat and walked out the back door.\n\nMOTHER was stunned for a moment but decided this was no time to be thinking of herself. Something must be done for Andrew. Mother's husband used to say, \"There's nothing for a sore heart like a tasty bite to eat.\" Andrew's favorite dish was a Scotch boiled fruit pudding.\n\nShe hadn't much time, but she hurried and got it on to boil. Andrew would also need a chicken dinner to go with the fruit pudding, Mother decided. But she was fond of her pullets. She had said not one of them should see the pot until its days of usefulness were over. But now, in this emergency, she sent Bob to kill and clean the fattest one in the coop. Then Bob went over on the sidehill and gathered some sage, and a round smooth rock. \"What are they for?\" Mother asked as her son brought them into the house. \"Well, they are what we used on the plains in the snowdrifts,\" he replied. \"This rock is a whopper.\" I don't know whether Andrew will weather this shock or not. Maybe it's ginger tea he needs. I just don't know what to do for him, but we can heat the rock for keeping Andrew's feet warm tonight.\" \"There were other things we used on the plains, remember, son,\" Mother said. \"A few prayers, and a lot of faith. I don't think we can help Andrew very much, but the Lord can and will. Perhaps you had better go to your bed early, not to sleep, but it will make it easier for Andrew.\" It was late when Andrew came in. He saw the pudding on the oven door, and smiled. \"Now, just a potato, a leg of chicken, and a dish of pudding, son. Anyone could eat that,\" he said. \"You killed a pullet, Mother, after all your warnings to us? Now what will you do for eggs this winter?\" \"Put cayenne pepper in the feed,\" she answered. \"You are a wise Scotch wife. I hope the pepper works.\" After supper Andrew went to Bob's room and lay down on his bed. Mother followed to light the lamp. She placed it on the table. The look of trouble on Andrew's face nearly broke her heart. \"I thought we were through the drifts,\" she said. \"This one seems larger than the others, but it isn't. They all seem big enough until we get through them. Then we know they weren't so bad.\" Andrew made no answer. \"Bob brought in some sage for soaking your feet, and a stone to keep them warm,\" Mother continued. \"I put it on the stove in the kitchen and I'll make some ginger tea to warm up those cold lumps inside.\" Still Andrew said nothing. Mother Mac continued, undaunted, \"I'm not through yet. I put some coal oil in the lamp and cleaned the chimney. Our lights are as bright as any in the other emigrant companies tonight. Shall we have prayers?\" Mother arose, knelt by the bedside and prayed: \"Help us through the snow. Our bins are full. We have plenty to eat, and lots of good wood in the yard to burn.\" She paused, choked with emotion when she remembered other days. She continued, \"But we need your help, tonight, Amen.\" Tears were running down Andrew's cheeks. \"The thaw,\" Mother exclaimed. \"Let the tears come. They will soften those hard lumps inside.\" \n\nANDREW decided to send the money, which he had saved for Jane's passage, to his family in Scotland. His mother did not want to leave the old home until all her children were married and settled down, but Andrew wanted the two youngest children to join him in America. Now he could take care of them, and he longed for someone of his own. Andrew returned to the wheat field. He had to take care of the crop. Work was greater than love. Jane was gone, but how very grateful he was that he still had work to do. Slowly the time passed. The grain matured and ripened. He began cutting it down with a scythe, slow and tiring work too slow. There was too much time to think, and to ponder. He worked alone. At this time of the year every man had more work than he could possibly get done. The days shortened. The nights grew longer, and longer, and darker. Threatening clouds appeared in the sky, then cleared away, but the man knew from the tang of frost in the air that winter was on its way. Sharp winds whined through the calm. The river shrank to a quiet trickle through the bottoms. Andrew listened and worked, grieved, and yearned for Jane. Sometimes the water composed and purled peaceful and understanding symphonies. It seemed to him that Jane had lived in this valley. At other harvests the golden grain had been the color of Jane's hair, the blue sky had symbolized her eyes, the luster of the sunshine her happy, gleaming smiles. But this was a harvest without a dream, a man without a sweetheart, a home without a wife. The river bottoms were very, very lonely.\n\n(PAYMENT)\n\nMerling D.

Note the dignified penguin and the happy horse.\n\nWhile Sister Margaret Peffer was the president of the Louisville, Kentucky, Branch Relief Society, she started making stuffed toys and dolls to sell at Relief Society bazaars. Most of the material she uses to make the animals and dolls comes from the scrap bag, except for the washable toys, and she buys this material by the yard, but she never uses old material. She uses clean cotton batting for stuffing, and the eyes are embroidered or buttons and beads are used. She makes the features with thread or embroidery work. In the past she has bought her patterns, but now makes her own. The work on these animals takes a lot of planning, and study; but it is very fascinating and is a good way to make a profit at the bazaar. At present Sister Peffer makes these toys only to sell at bazaars and as presents for her grandchildren and little friends. The dolls, horses, and Humpty-Dumpties seem to be the most favored among the children and they sell the quickest.\n\nRisen Flame\n\nRuth Harwood All life should be fluidic,\n\nShould freely flow upon the stream of time.\n\nSave only man's one constancy.\n\nSave only spirit's risen flame!\n\nPage 610\n\nHome Safe Home Leone O. Jacobs, Member, Relief Society General Board\n\nThe attitude of complacency with which we think of home is responsible for many of the accidents which occur therein. We think of home as a place to drop all our troubles and worries—the one place where we can completely relax. But often we relax too completely.\n\nWe must be alert to the hazards in our homes, for they are more common than we realize. We caution our children to be careful when they go out away from the home circle, when they are driving, or taking part in sports, or even in crossing the streets, but we seldom think it necessary to caution them of conditions in the home. Another reason for home accidents is the fact that we are so familiar with conditions in and around our own homes that we don't recognize them as dangers, or if we do, we feel sure we can successfully cope with them. Perhaps our basement stairs have been poorly lighted or without a handrail, for goodness knows how long, but every member of the family is so used to them he is sure he can descend blindfolded. Maybe mother has used a none-too solid stepladder for hanging curtains and washing woodwork for many years, but no disaster has ever happened, no one has fallen, so why not go on using it for several years more? Water has been dripping off the eaves onto the front steps and freezing there, for many winters, but no one has slipped or broken a leg, so why get excited about it? Sometimes people feel they just can't afford to have repair work done or new installations made, and it seems to be human nature to delay the remedying of faulty conditions until something serious occurs. They continue with slipshod practices until an accident does take place, then bemoan their lack of wisdom after the milk is already spilt. It is always economy to keep the home and its premises in good repair and in a safe condition.\n\nThere are many little practices which mothers, especially, should impress upon themselves until they are unconsciously aware of them at all times: handles of pans and kettles should always be turned in toward the stove, away from the reach of curious hands. Three-year-old David spent weeks of suffering in a hospital, and his parents spent hundreds of dollars and weeks of excruciating anxiety because David's mother left the handle of the pan in which she was making seven-minute cake icing, projecting over the edge of the stove. Avoid carrying hot liquids. Stair carpets should be inspected often to make sure they are securely fastened. Toys or other articles should not be left on stair steps. (Falls constitute the majority of accidents and fatalities in the home.) Disconnect electrical equipment when leaving it. Don't leave small children alone. Don't leave a small child in the bathtub while answering the phone or going on any other errand. It takes only a very short time, Page 611 and a very little water for a little one to drown. And no one can predict the length of telephone conversations. 'They may take only a moment, but again they may be ten or thirty minutes in length. Matches and poisons should be kept out of reach of children. Rightly, poisons should be kept under lock and key. In using new electrical, or other equipment, always read and follow instructions carefully. \"The right way is always the safe way.\"\n\nThere are certain fallacies that must be overcome, also, if we are to prevent accidents. The National Safety Council lists them in the following order: 1. The attitude that \"It can't happen to me.\" A terrible accident might happen to you, or you, or you, but it just wouldn't happen to me. What a mistaken ideal! A good slogan is: \"Be careful, the life you save may be your own.\" 2. The attitude that \"When my number's up, I'll go.\" This idea is fatalistic and is a denial of personal responsibility. Surely all the accidents that do happen, don't have to happen! 3. Relying on the law of averages to keep safe. 4. The idea that it is \"sissified\" to be careful.' Young people, especially, are guilty of this fallacy. 5. The idea that accidents are the price of progress that they are the price we pay for any advancement of science or industry and just one of those things we must accept. But figures prove that industry, through concentrated effort, has eliminated accidents to a surprisingly low figure far below the number that take place in the homes. 6. The idea that accidents are the price of sin. We often hear people say, \"What have I done to deserve this?\" While accidents may not be the price of what we term sin, they many times are the price of someone's carelessness or bad practices. It is an individual responsibility to guard not only one's life but the lives of others, as well.\n\nLet us rid our minds of false notions and let us not relax beyond the point of safety in our homes.\n\nDesert Rain\nEva Willes Wangsgaard\n\nA day like this engenders gratitude. You hear the rain plink-plank a great guitar; you watch it fall where growing ponds include each singing drop to make a silver star. This is a day for walking. You can feel the rain's smooth fingers on your hands and face, and earth's resilience underneath your heel, where grasses spilling silver interlace. You swing off down the pathway, and the rain hangs silver fringes round you everywhere. Each stream-filled gutter is a silver lane as you stride onward breathing silver air. You rise above the city's sordid crowd and pace the silver lining of a cloud.\n\nPhotograph by Glen Perrins\nMount Kit Carson, near Spokane, Washington\nNative Bear Grass in the foreground\n\nSeptember Day\nEvelyn Fjeldsted\n\nOh, beautiful September day,\nthy calm throughout the centuries\ncomes gently to the heart attuned\nas quiet hours steal away.\nTime is painting orchard wealth,\nhills are veiled in mystery;\nerrant winds are whispering\nselecting autumn drapery.\n\nThy peace is sweet, fade not away,\noh, beautiful September day.\n\nPage 613\n\nSudden Storm\nCarol Read Flake\n\nH, what a beautiful morning!\nJanet Harding caroled happily as she ran down the back steps with a pan of scraps for the dog. The world was filled to bursting with the glory of early summer—the iris bowing gracefully along the driveway, the willow tree sweeping the green carpet of lawn. Who could putter around with housework on a day like this? Besides, the flowers at the side of the house needed weeding. Janet's smile broadened at the intermittent clatter of the lawn mower around front. \"That was Benny, just turned six, struggling to show his little sister that he, too, was big enough to mow the lawn.\" \"Oh, what a beautiful da-a-y! Here, Ricky! Here, Ricky!\" Janet set the pan of scraps on the ground, caught up the trowel that lay in the children's wagon, and rounded the comer of the house. \"I have a wonderful fee....\" The song froze on her lips. Across the hedge Marj Appleby was hanging a wash, her slight figure straightened, towel in hand, her eyes met Janet's. But only for an instant. Turning her back, she gave the towel a flip that sounded like a shot out of a gun.\n\nWoodenly past the tangled flowers front of the house. \"Mommie! Mommie!\" Sharon screamed, dancing excitedly about.\n\nPage 614\n\nflamed and for a rooted to the she walked to the Benny and the mower. \"See what Benny do.\"\n\n\"Oh, hush, Sharon. Stop that screeching,\" Janet answered irritably, sitting down on the warm cement step. \"Benny, get away from that machine.\"\n\nThe boy's mouth fell open. \"But Mom I'm mowing the lawn. You told Daddy it gotta be mowed.\" \n\nJanet was not listening. With her chin cupped in her hands she gazed absently beyond the children, her brown eyes troubled, her heart a choking weight within her.\n\nFor over a month she had been unable to see Marj or even think about her without this awful sick feeling. They hadn't spoken to each other in all that time. And once they had been so close, running into each other's homes without knocking, walking to the grocery together, keeping each other's children while one went to town.\n\nOh, it was ridiculous that things had come to this stage. But I apologized, Janet reminded herself for the hundredth time. I fell all over myself trying to make amends. She's the one who refuses to speak.\n\nA flock of blackbirds zoomed out of the blue and settled on the hedge for a moment's noisy chatter. Beautiful day! Janet sprang up and went inside, letting the screen door bang behind her.\n\nTHE living room was dark to eyes that had been staring into sun. She jerked at down on the light. It was chilly. The drapes and sank SUDDEN STORM davenport in a patch of sunshine. \n\nIt was right here, she remembered miserably, that she had been comfortably dozing when Marj telephoned. \"I've sent Benny home,\" Marj announced, her voice shrill. \"I don't mean to make trouble, Janet, and I hope you won't be mad, but really! He and Martin were playing on the back porch and Benny brought Ricky in. He got to jumping around and knocked over the table where I keep my potted plants broke them to pieces. My azaleas, that I've just been nursing along.\"\n\n\"Oh, Marj,\" Janet moaned. They had bought their azaleas at the same time. \"Marj, I'm just sick. I'll give you mine. They're not nearly so...\"\n\n\"OH, they're just plants, but really.\" Benny appeared in the kitchen, inching along the sink, his small face twisted with silent weeping. He cast an unhappy glance at his mother and moved out of sight.\n\n\"Benny will certainly be punished,\" Janet promised hotly. \"T'll be over in a few minutes, Marj.\" Janet hung up and advanced upon her son. \"Benjamin Harding, I could just I've told you a dozen times to stay out of Appleby's house. And Ricky....\" Benny stepped backward. \"Mama,\" he pleaded, \"I didn't take Ricky in there. I didn't. It was Martin who whistled him in. He had a ball he was makin' him jump after.\" His lower lip quivered.\n\nJanet scowled, somewhat mollified. She was visualizing Marj Appleby scolding him, sending him home \"Benny Harding, you take this dog of yours and get outa here. I'm gonna call up your Mama right now!\" \n\n\"OH, Benny,\" the boy sobbed against her, \"Ricky broke all her nice plants, darling. You shouldn't have been in there at all, I've told you, Benny.\" Benny raised his face. \"You said not to go in the house, Mama. Is the porch the house, is it, Mom?\" Janet stood biting her lip. \"I don't know,\" she answered absently. \"I'm going over there now.\"\n\nMA8J had been sweeping up dirt, and greeted Janet with an annoyed flourish of her arm. \"Isn't this a fine mess?\" Janet bent and began picking up pieces of pottery. \"I'll replace all these pots,\" she said quietly, \"and any of the plants I can.\" \n\n\"Oh, indeed you won't. I have empty pots in the basement and the plants will all grow again. It's just that oh, they were doing so well.\" \"I know.\" Janet waited. Then, \"Benny said Martin let the dog in.\"\n\nMarj stopped sweeping. \"Martin,\" she called, \"did you let that dog in here?\" 616\n\nRELIEVE SOCIETY MAGAZINE SEPTEMBER 1948\n\nMartin came to the doorway, glanced defiantly at the women. He was sick. In his first year at school.\n\n\"Course not,\" he answered. \"Ricky won't mind anybody but Benny.\"\n\nMarj shrugged and went on with her sweeping. \"Well, it doesn't matter who let him in, he did a fine job breaking up my plants.\"\n\nJanet stared at her. It doesn't matter!\" She wanted to cry. So it didn't matter that she had humiliated her son, broken his heart.\n\nShe turned abruptly. \"I'll see that Benny doesn't come again. He does...\"\n\n\"Oh, now, Janet,\" Marj broke in longheartedly. \"There's no need for that. He and Martin play so well together.\"\n\n\"He disobeyed me by coming inside at all.\" Janet finished. \"He'll never do it again.\" She closed the door firmly behind her as she went out.\n\nIt was Benny who reported the incident to his father. Janet thought Ben unusually harsh on the boy for his disobedience. But she was completely unprepared for his reproof of her later in the evening.\n\n\"The trouble with you, Janet,\" he told her, \"is that you have confused the issue. The real cause of the fuss is Ricky, not Benny. It was the dog Marj wanted to get rid of and she had to send Benny home to do it. Your sympathy was all with Marj until you learned it was probably Martin who let the dog in. Then you imagined some great injustice had been done, when as a matter of fact, it was just as Marj said, it isn't who let him in, but the damage he did by being in. You've apologized for that and offered reparation, which was refused. That should be an end of the matter. There's nothing to be so upset about that I can see.\"\n\nJanet glared. \"Thank you so much, Judge Harding, for your esteemed opinion of the case,\" she said acidly and flung away from him.\n\nBen caught her hand, laughing. \"Oh, now, honey, I know it isn't quite that simple. I wasn't trying to minimize your hurt, or Benny's. But Benny and Martin will have forgotten this thing by morning. It's you and Marj who must see what a small thing it is before it goes any further. Go see her tomorrow. Everything will be all right.\n\nNEXT morning when Janet ran out to bring in the paper, Marj, as it often happened, was just leaving to drive her husband to work. She looked right at her. Janet was positive about that; but before she could speak, Marj had turned back quickly to close the door. Any other day Janet would have called out a cheery good morning, regardless. But this morning, self-consciously, she refrained. All day she fretted about the incident.\n\nThe next morning was almost an exact repetition. Marj made a great business of pulling on her gloves and closing the door, giving Janet ample time to pick up the paper and return inside. After that, Janet sent Benny for the paper. And that was the beginning of many awkward evasions that were making life miserable for her.\nSuch as last week when Benny had his sixth birthday, such an important anniversary to a little boy, and she hadn't given him a party simply because she hadn't the heart either to invite or exclude Martin, SUDDEN STORM his favorite playmate. For, of course, the little boys continued playing blissfully together, just as Ben had predicted. Ben! Janet started guiltily. He was due home for lunch this minute, and here she sat. From the kitchen window she watched as he turned in the driveway. Across the lot she saw Marj Appleby backing out of her garage. Of course. This was Friday. Marj always drove out to her mother's on this day. Often Janet and the children rode along. Wouldn't today be perfect for a drive in the country? Well, at least she could take care of those poor flowers. She had neglected them all these weeks because they were on the side of the house next to Appleby's!\n\"Hi, honey,\" Ben greeted her, coming in with Sharon on his shoulders and Benny clinging leach-like to his leg. He deposited his little daughter in her high chair and beamed proudly at Benny. \"Well, Mama, I see you have a gardener to help keep up the place. Did you notice the front lawn?\" Janet managed a tight little smile. Keeping up the place was often a touchy subject in the Harding household. \"He worked real hard at it,\" she conceded. \"But, oh, Ben, there's so much to be done here. The hedge needs trimming and my pansies....\" She paused, then plunged on impulsively. \"Ben, why don't we sell this place while prices are up? We could get by on a place with half this yard space, get a place closer in or farther out....\" Her voice trailed off uncertainly as she became aware of Ben's openmouthed expression. \"Sell?\" he repeated. \"Why, Janet, I thought you considered this place ideal. I know I don't have much time for the yard, but you said yourself we needed plenty of room so we could add to the house as our family increased.\" Janet bit her lip and bent quickly to tie Sharon's bib. Somehow she did not want to meet Ben's gaze.\nThe children did most of the talking at the table. As Ben finished his dessert he remarked casually, \"I saw Marj leaving for her mother's. Doesn't she ask you to go along any more?\" Janet gave him a quick glance. \"I have a lot of work to do outside,\" she evaded. She felt an unaccountable resentment toward her husband. Was he being callous or caustic? She made no move to walk out to the car with him as she usually did and he did not come around the table to kiss her. At the door he turned. \"I can ask Browning and Bates how much this place should bring.\" Then he added pointedly, \"You know, you can move away from your neighborhood, but you can't move away from yourself.\"\nJanet stared after him, feeling her face grow scarlet. She squeezed her eyes tightly over the hot tears and left the table abruptly so the children would not see. Almost mechanically she did the dishes, put Sharon down for her nap and went out to the pansy bed. She found no joy whatever in her work. The bursting enthusiasm of the morning that had thrust all thought of Marj Appleby from her mind had dissolved into a spirit of listless dejection. She felt all bogged down in a situation that would not better itself with the mere passage of time. Rather it had grown worse. She had spoken thoughtlessly at noon, and now Ben was hurt and displeased with her. His words still stung: You can't move away from yourself.\nOh, Ben, she pleaded in her heart, what am I going to do? She had waited too long to follow his suggestion. After all this time, could she go to the Appleby door and say, Marj, can't we forget this thing between us, can't we be friends again? No, she could not.\nThe sun disappeared. Janet glanced up and was mildly surprised to see that the western sky had grown murky. Rain again. She rose stiffly and went inside. Sharon needed covering. Crossing to her own room, Janet stood contemplating the little half-finished pinafore. She was in no mood for sewing. Restlessly she walked through the rooms. It was growing darker. An elusive brilliance darted in and out of the house.\nJanet went to the back door and called to Benny, but her voice was lost in the explosion of thunder. She ran down the steps and around the house, her skirt billowing in a sudden gust of wind. Benny was tugging at the lawn mower. \"Never mind, Mom,\" he vowed. \"I can get it in the garage.\" \"Well, hurry, dear. It's going to pour in a minute.\" She turned back. Then she stopped. \"Oh!\" she gasped, and darted across the lawn and through the opening in the hedge.\nA splinter of lightning was hurled across the horizon. \"The next will bring rain,\" Janet mumbled into Marj's crisp, whipping sheets as her fingers groped for the clothespins. Back in her own kitchen Janet set about preparing dinner. The children cluttered the floor with their blocks, the eaves of the house dripped monotonously after the downpour. But a song rose to Janet's lips as she contentedly pared potatoes at the sink. She felt refreshed and at peace with herself, a peace she had not known in a long while.\nFor Janet had reached a decision. It was a simple decision, one she had stubbornly rejected all these weeks. It had come to her after she had hurried with the last armful of clothes into Marj's kitchen and piled them with the others on the table. She brought a basket from the porch and pressed into it all the pieces that had tumbled to the floor. The sheets and towels she folded, making a neat stack upon the drainboard.\nAnd as she worked, there in Marj Appleby's kitchen that was almost as familiar to her as her own, Janet experienced again the warmth and intimacy of their long friendship, remembering their little acts of helpfulness for each other, small services gladly given. The rain swept in gusts against the windowpanes and Janet glanced out of Marj's window across the way to her own home, the Harding home. In that moment it was almost as if she were Marj Appleby, and Janet knew with startling clarity that Marj was as deeply hurt and wretched over the whole affair as she herself was.\nIt was then Janet had made her decision.\n\nShe promised herself that the minute Marj returned, the very minute, mind you, she would run out and throw her arms about her Sudden Storm and tell her what a stubborn, stupid horrid person she had been. And Ben, dear Ben, she could hardly wait to tell him the same. She had raced home through the rain, her heart singing. Janet stopped humming and leaned far over her sink so she could watch the street, watch for Appleby's car. Why, there it was now, in their driveway. She heard a quick sound on the porch. The kitchen door burst open. Marj Appleby stood there, her eyes brimming. \"Janet.... My clothes....\" \"Marj!\" The paring knife dropped to the floor. \"Oh, Marj,\" Janet cried as they rushed into each other's arms. They were both crying and trying to talk at the same time. Finally they had to stop and they stood back, laughing at themselves.\n\nLater, as they were chatting beside the hedge, their children and Ricky romped about the lawn. Everything had the green, fragrant freshness that follows a sudden summer rain, and the sun's low rays filled the world with that special mellow glow. Janet heard a car on the gravel and turned eagerly, joyfully. Ben stepped from the car, his face reflecting the sun's golden light as he smiled at the two women across the lawn. \"Ben,\" Janet called happily, waving her arms in a sweeping gesture that took in their house, the yard, the whole world, \"Oh, Ben darling, isn't this a beautiful evening!\"\n\nBETWEEN FRIENDS\nMabel Jones Gabbott\n\nLast night we disagreed;\nAnd though the cause was slight,\nI found no peace at all\nUntil we talked it right.\n\nToday, the threads that link\nOur hearts and bind our need\nAre stronger than before\nBecause we disagreed.\n\nHOMECOMING\nJosephine J. Harvey\n\nHe saw all the dear, familiar things\nThat had not changed while he had been away,\nAnd deep within his heart he knew\nHow good it was, to be back home to stay.\n\nHe turned to her who stood beside him,\nWhose lifted face was waiting for his kiss.\nHer love his beacon light would never dim\nHe thought: God meant heaven to be like this.\n\nPlain and Savory\nNEW RECIPES FOR FAMILIAR FOODS\nSara Mills\n\nF broiled steak and fried chicken aren't compatible with your budget, don't get discouraged. There are still good things to be had.\nSome of the world's best dishes had their origins in the cookery of folk who had to make plain food savory and nourishing.\nOne such dish I herewith christen savory cabbage rolls. Up until now it has graced our table unnamed.\nIt is served on gala occasions when our guests are specially appreciative of good food. Fine fare it is also for the family.\nIf it isn't eaten in one meal, it is even better the second day. Six to eight persons may be served from it.\n\nTo round out savory cabbage rolls into a complete meal, add only a salad and a dessert.\nFor balanced vitamins and an artistic effect, you may like to serve a yellow vegetable with the meal.\nCarrots, shredded and baked in a covered dish, are good. Frozen cut corm is another easy and pleasing vegetable to serve.\n\nIf you have been with me these past months, you know that I favor fruit for dessert.\nIf I serve a fruit dessert, I let the salad be a green, tossed one. But if I serve cake, I make a fruit gelatine salad.\nAlong with some hot dinner rolls or some French bread, oven-toasted with garlic butter, a splendid meal awaits.\n\nSAVORY CABBAGE ROLLS\n1 large head of green cabbage (or two smaller ones)\n1 pound ground lean beef, either chuck or round, but lean\nY% pound ground lean pork\n1 generous teaspoon chili powder\n1 teaspoon or so grated onion\n1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce\n1 clove garlic minced (optional)\ndash of Tabasco sauce\n1 cup uncooked rice, preferably brown\nsalt and pepper to taste\npulp from 1-quart can tomatoes\njuice from 1-quart can tomatoes\n1 small can tomato sauce (optional)\na pinch of basil\n\nFirst remove the core from the head of cabbage.\nPlace the cabbage in a covered pan containing a cup of water and let cook until the leaves begin to soften.\nThen remove the cabbage from the water. Meantime prepare all the other ingredients except the tomato juice and basil by mixing them together in a large bowl. Make sure that you have plenty of salt.\n\nPlace a spoonful of the mixture in the center of a cabbage leaf and fold envelope-wise, securing the leaf with a toothpick.\nSet the rolls gently in a large, heavy kettle, preferably one with a rack, or in an electric casserole, if you are lucky enough to own one. Pour the tomato juice over the cabbage rolls; add salt and pepper and the pinch of basil; cover and let steam for at least two hours.\n\nAfter the dish has steamed awhile, I like to add the tomato sauce, or a portion of it.\nThe trick in cooking is to simmer the rolls gently and get just the right amount of liquid for serving. If you get too little, the dish is dry, too much, and the quality isn't right.\nYou may, if necessary, add extra juice, a little chili sauce, or even water.\n\nServe this dish in the electric casserole or transfer it to a large, heated platter. Then wait for the reactions.\n\nMy second special meat dish is Lamb Stew, spelled with capitals.\nThis is no ordinary lamb stew such as legend connects with boarding houses or hasty cooks.\nIt-is a PLAIN AND SAVORY delectable dish, good enough for any company or Sunday dinner.\nThe cheapest cuts of lamb are used. And you will do well to remember that the origin of this dish is French.\n\nLAMB STEW\n2 pounds lamb cut in small pieces (neck, shoulder, or breast cuts)\n10 or so small white onions or one medium sliced onion\n2 tablespoons flour\n3 cups meat stock or 3 cups water and 3 bouillon cubes\nsalt and pepper\n1 flavor bouquet (1 small bay leaf, 1 sprig thyme, 6 sprigs parsley and 3 sprigs celery leaves, tied with thread)\n1 clove. Garlic\n1 cup tomato puree\n3 carrots, diced\n% pound cut green beans\n% pound green peas\n2-3 potatoes sliced\n1 small can mushrooms (or fresh, if you have them)\n1 tbsp. Chopped parsley for serving\ncheese and parsley dumplings (optional)\n\nSear the lamb pieces, with fat trimmed off, until all sides are browned.\nBacon drippings are good for this. Season with salt and pepper and add the onions, peeled, or peeled and sliced, and cook until they are well browned.\nDrain off all the fat and put the mixture in a stew pot or large earthen casserole.\n\nNow sift the two tablespoons of flour over the meat and mix well.\n621\n\nNext add gradually the three cups of stock and the cup of tomato puree, the clove of garlic, salt and pepper, and the bouquet, which you have previously tied with a thread. Bring the mixture to a boil, then let it simmer slowly for about an hour. Then add the diced carrots, the potatoes, the string beans, and peas, along with the mushrooms and let simmer until the vegetables are tender. Taste also for seasoning. Remove the bouquet and serve on a heated, deep platter with the parsley dusting the top of the stew. If you like dumplings, drop them onto the stew about twelve minutes before the dish has finished cooking. Add a handful of chopped parsley and 1/3 cup grated cheese to your favorite dumpling recipe. Or you may prefer a shortcut to dumplings. Mine is to mix a half cup of milk with a cup of prepared waffle flour and season with the cheese and parsley. Remember not to remove the lid while the dumplings are steaming. Serve a fruit salad with this Lamb Stew or a dessert of fresh fruit and cheese.\n\nOMNIPOTENCE\nJeanette P. Parry\n\nI saw the yellow moon above the clouds\nThat climb into the blue of peaceful skies,\nA silence filled the woods like huddled sheep,\nSave when the crimson leaves fell down to sleep.\nThere was no afterglow of summer life,\nOnly the flash of a late robin's breast;\nI saw the grass, frost-browned at winter's will,\nThe rivulets that trickled cold and still.\n\nI was not troubled that skies were leaden\nAnd leafless aspens graced the frost-touched hills,\nA Power greater than our own bestows\nThe miracle of crimson woods and snows."

Ekman I have come back to our mountains,\nTo our valleys and inland sea;\nTo cedared hills and cattle range,\nIn quest of tranquility.\nWarm wind flows down from the foothills\nAnd pours over fields of grain;\nGlistening blades of tasseled corn\nAre rippling and rustling again;\nWatching the bearded barley blow,\nIn billowing waves like the sea,\nBrings back a spindrift of moments\nThat are lost forever to me.\nOver the hills dry leaves will drift,\nWinters will lay white covers down;\nSprings will return and lilies bend,\nThe summers fade and fields burn brown.... \nAs west wind combs the mauve hill grass\nAnd brine waves cream the sands with foam,\nSo, shuttle-swift, let my days pass\nUntil I reach my love and home.\nVOL. 35, NO. 10 OCTOBER 1948\n\nYour Friend—the Magazine Alberta H. Christensen Member, Relief Society General Board\n\nOf the most challenging statements in Latter-day Saint literature is found in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 130:18-19. It is this:\n\"Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.\nAnd if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.\"\nIf this be true, and we believe it is, we are under the moral obligation to study and to learn, to seek wisdom through the pursuit of truth.\nLimitations of time and mental capacity may prevent us from being expert in most fields, but each of us can enlarge her understanding by study and by maintaining mental alertness to the opportunities around us.\n\nAll Latter-day Saint women are familiar with the words of the Prophet, spoken at the Relief Society meeting of April 28, 1842, when he said,\n\"... And this society shall rejoice and knowledge and intelligence shall flow down from this time henceforth.\"\nIt was thus the intent from the beginning of the organization that intelligence, which is the capacity for understanding, should grow and expand through divine guidance, and that the gaining of knowledge should be fostered, its power felt and wisely used by its members.\n\nPage 652\n\nIt is also apparent that the dual objective of the Relief Society was recognized at this early date. Service to others and the development of self have been the two-fold aim kept constantly in mind by those who have guided the organization to its present maturity.\nAn educational program was organized which has developed through succeeding years. In time, uniform courses of study were planned, their specific purpose being to teach those eternal principles which are the foundation of the gospel; to develop faith through understanding so that all might enjoy the fruits of the spirit: and to assist the members in meeting the daily problems of life.\n\nIt was with a definite objective and with definite needs in mind that Thecame into being. Its editors have been and are conscious of the needs and problems which face the Latter-day Saint family and are endeavoring to help in their solution through this medium.\nThey are conscious of the busy life which the average Latter-day Saint mother lives and have selected types of material which will not only meet personal needs but will conform in reading time to a busy schedule. This wise selection of material is important, for the complexity of modern living demands that we be selective as never before.\n\nThe woman of today furnishes her home\nby choosing from many types of furniture and multiple objects of art.\nShe chooses her wardrobe from numerous fabrics and designs,\nand her hobbies from a wide variety of interesting activities.\nDiscrimination is especially important in filling her leisure time, for in spite of the many labor-saving devices, her interests have widened and there is increased activity from which to choose.\n\nSomeone has wisely said that it is not what one needs to do but what one chooses to do that distinguishes character. \nThe woman of today must be especially selective in her reading\nfor the amount of printed material placed monthly before the public is tremendous.\nShe must select from this morass that which she feels will best fill her needs, mentally, aesthetically, and spiritually.\nWith time as a limiting factor, it is obvious that she must choose wisely.\n\nDoes Thequalify to a place on the selective reading list of the Latter-day Saint woman? I think that it does because it meets so many of her needs. Helpful suggestions on almost all phases of homemaking are given.\nPre-tested recipes and nutritional budget-wise menus lead the busy housewife to new ways of preparing familiar foods.\nSuggestions on making and remodeling of clothing should be especially appreciated at present because of the sudden change in design and length.\n\nThere is poetry and short fiction for an aesthetic lift—a little star dust to sprinkle on the ironing board and the dishpan.\nLetters from near and distant readers attest the fact that the quality of both poem and story is being improved and appreciated. \nThe Magazine also supplies a market (though limited) for the creative efforts of Latter-day Saint women.\nAlthough not many contributions can be used monthly, encouragement is offered writers through the Eliza R. Snow Poem and the Relief Society Short Story contests and through the gracious consideration of material submitted at any time.\n\nThe outlines for the courses of study are not only indispensable to the class leaders,\nbut can be equally helpful and stimulating to all who read them carefully.\nMuch thought and skill have gone into their preparation.\nHere is a deep well of wisdom for every reader who will make the text her own through individual reflection. \nHere is guidance in the art of living for all who will make application.\nAnd here is found in the counsel of the wise, a kindly light which mellows trials and can heal a sorrow.\n\nEditorials and special articles offer spiritual enrichment to all who read them thoughtfully,\nand one must not overlook the attractive covers which the Magazine is \"wearing.\"\nThey have received much commendation. \n\"Notes from the Field\" with accompanying photographs impress us with the unity of purpose and strength of a great organization.\nBut perhaps the Magazine's greatest service lies in the fact that it radiates a definite spiritual influence;\na service-loving, beauty-seeking influence which can revitalize any home which greets it and treats it as a friend."

    "content": "Relief Society Building News\n\"Building News\" will continue to be printed until the names of all stakes and wards, missions and branches which attained 100% of the Building Fund have been printed,\nin order that they may be recognized and that Thecontain a full historical record.\nThere will be many mementos of the past epoch-making year treasured by Relief Society through coming years. \nFirst will be the voluminous central record preserved by the general board in book form\nin which will be inscribed the name of every Relief Society Quota Gift contributor, and that of every Special Gift and Memorial Gift contributor.\n\nIt is planned that the compiled names of contributors will be kept in a special case in the Relief Society Building. Likewise, in the cornerstone of the Relief Society Building will be placed a duplicate listing of contributors to remain as long as the Relief Society Building itself stands. Each stake and mission in the Church achieving 100% will guard the Certificate of Achievement issued to it. Every ward and branch in the Church achieving 100% will also have a Certificate of Achievement to treasure as evidence of the loyalty and faithfulness of the sisters of that ward or branch. In addition, the ward and branch record books will contain a detailed account of all contributions to become a lasting record of the generosity of Relief Society and church members today.\n\nAny Relief Society member may be the proud possessor of three types of receipt cards: (1) the Quota Receipt Card for the payment of a quota donation; (2) a Special Gift Receipt Card for the payment of a donation in excess of the quota; and (3) Memorial Gift Receipt Card for every Memorial Gift made. Non-Relief Society members may prize two types of receipt cards— a Special Gift Receipt Card and a Memorial Gift Receipt Card. These individual Receipt Cards will become increasingly prized over the years.\n\nMany of the great future leaders of Relief Society who today are mere girls will undoubtedly own \"Special Gift Receipt Cards.\" The Relief Society, as part of the Church, makes painstaking records and carefully preserves them, and out of Relief Society record books will shine forever bright the devoted and unselfish services of the women of the Church in the Relief Society Building Fund program of October 1947 to October 1948.\n\nSTAKES WHICH HAVE SENT IN 100% BUILDING QUOTAS\nSouth Idaho Falls Stake

look at herself in the long mirror. Sighing, she walked slowly towards the door. She didn't want to linger in the dressing room, painfully conscious of the contrast between the other girls' bright and pretty costumes and her own ultrasevere, dark, tailored suit.\nJanice Foy, carefully pinning blond curls, looked up as Dixie passed her. \"All ready, already?\"\n\"I'll do. I'm supposed to look a mess, you know.\" Dixie answered ironically.\nJanice laughed. \"But you don't. It'd take more than a tight hairdo and thick glasses and mannish clothes, to make a mess of anyone as good-looking as you. You know that!\"\nPeggy Morrow, eyebrow pencil poised, turned round to say in a careful, low tone, \"So do other people. Including Mavis Finley.\"\n\"Thanks, chums. You're such comforts.\" Dixie smiled. She paused to zip up the back of Peggy's silver-sequined frock, then went on out of the room and wandered upstairs.\nA lot it helps, she thought, to be pretty! Clyde never sees anyone but Mavis . . . not that she ever gives him an opportunity. I'll be glad when tonight is over! I'm glad we're only giving two performances! She'd had such dreams, joining the \"Lakeville Thespians\" . . . . Mavis was in on it. When it came of convincing Mother and Daddy that she'd be ready for dramatics college next fall, to head for a real career. And . . . romantic dreams, concerning Clyde Warren, the junior college's handsome, young, new athletic coach .\nWonderful, tall dreams . . . now fallen as flat as pancakes from yesterday's batter. Because of Mavis Finley!\nWell, she might have guessed what Mavis was thinking of when she organized the \"Thespians.\" Everything Mavis ever did was first of all for Mavis. From a diamond-set baby locket on her first birthday to fur coats and airplane trips in her twenties, Mavis had always had everything of the best, and had taken it for granted she always would. She queened it over Lakeville's younger set consistently, snatched the attentions of every attractive young man in town and somehow held them just as long as it pleased her. That had been going on for years.\nNot that there was anything wrong cheap or questionable in her behavior. There wasn't. Mavis was charming and talented, an outstanding young woman. The trouble was, simply, that other girls got tired of seeing Mavis lap up all the cream all the time.\nDIXIE had never fully understood what a menace Mavis could be to other girls' happiness, until after Clyde Warren came to Lakeville. That was when. The trouble grow up all at once and became a\nPage 661 662 woman, head-over-heels in love! And she a mere freshman at the college what chance had she? \"The Thespians\" had seemed her opportunity. Clyde Warren was joining.\n\nAnd as Dixie had, all through school, played important parts in plays and on programs and was said to have lots of talent, she thought joyfully that now she'd have a chance to stand out from the crowd, be noticed by the object of her daydreams. She might have guessed that Mavis would have her own ideas as to that! Truth dawned on Dixie after the cast for \"Island Idyll\" was announced. It was the \"Thespians'\" first production; Mavis had written the play, she was taking the leading feminine role—Eve Hudson—and Clyde was to play the hero, Adam Rowe. Eve and Adam! Disgusting, Dixie thought. If it had been anyone but Mavis, the town would have buzzed. But Mavis, being above reproach, could get away with—even this! No one, not even Dixie's closest friends, knew how Dixie felt about Clyde. It was as if he occupied a secret shrine down in her heart, too sacred for sharing even a knowledge of its existence. Maybe it would have to be that way forever.... Low in spirit, Dixie wandered among the backstage maze of scenery and props, past the wings, down to the end of the curtain. Pulling its edge back a little, she watched the auditorium filling; people drifting in, in pairs, in parties; trickling down the aisles. She recognized the Finleys, a jovial family group. Her father and mother, quiet but eager. She noticed Steven Taylor, editor publisher of the town newspaper. Coming in with a distinguished-looking stranger. \"Look good?\" asked a deep, young voice so close behind Dixie that she jumped. \"Oh, I'm sorry—I didn't mean to scare you, Dixie,\" said Roy Taylor. Roy was Steven's nephew. Dixie felt a little annoyed. How long had Roy been standing behind her? \"Take a look,\" she told him, stepping aside. \"It's better even than last night. Lots of folks coming for a second sight.\" \"Why shouldn't they?\" he grinned. \"We're good, aren't we?\" \"The best 'Thespians' Lakeville ever had!\" Dixie laughed. Admiring him in his formal black-and-white—he was one of Eve's dinner guests in act one—she thought he looked surprisingly mature and attractive. He'll be a handsome man.... Turning suddenly, he smiled at her approval. \"Yep, we're well worth seeing twice. Especially,\" he added quietly, \"Eve Hudson's secretary. You know, Dixie, you... Well, you're super!\" \"Thank you, Roy,\" Dixie said graciously. She let him take her hand for a shy, gentle squeeze. \"Super—in lots of ways!\" he murmured. She retorted, \"You kid nicely, d'you know it?\" And more casually, \"It must be almost curtain time.\" She took another quick peek at the audience. \"Did you see your uncle? He's down front, with someone I never saw before.\" He gave her a queer look. \"Dixie, how about a soda or something, and a round or so at Roxy's after the show?\" Dixie hesitated. She'd refused him so many times. Since Clyde CURTAIN CALL came into her heart, fellow-freshmen like Roy had seemed mere juveniles.... But Clyde wasn't giving her any tumble; maybe she might as well make Roy happy. \"Why, yes, I'd like it,\" she replied. Funny, the way his face lighted. He had such nice eyes, smoky-gray with bluish sparkles when he smiled. Last time he'd asked for a date and she'd refused, the smile had been so wistful that her conscience had hurt. He deserved a \"yes\"... Especially, being so nice to her in this get-up! She couldn't resist saying, lightly, \"You're brave, Roy. What if I'd forget to quit being Sally Johnson before we step out?\" \"I'd risk it. You're still the best-looking girl in the play, Dixie. And the best actress. And—I think somebody's going to have a surprise, tonight.\" BEFORE she could ask him what he meant, there was a stir of activity in the wings, and they hurried away to prepare their entrances. Passing lower left, Dixie saw Mavis in powder-pink lace and pearls, waiting with Clyde for their cues. They were smiling deeply into each other's eyes, and Mavis's were narrowed provocatively. Dixie's heart sank lower. Sally Johnson was supposed to care nothing about clothes; to despise men, to take no interest in social affairs except as she must keep track of Eve's dates. Her many lines were important to the building-up of Eve, but never once allowed Sally to sparkle for Dixie. Once the curtain went up, of course, Dixie's resentment at being so unfavorably cast was forgotten. 663 There wasn't time to think, only to act, she reflected humorously. She moved from cue to cue, remembering to handle her notebooks and pencils convincingly, to make the audience feel she really was the efficient and worshipful—but un-glamorous—secretary, seeing to it that Eve, at least, was appreciated, especially by Adam Rowe. Watching him, Dixie wasn't sure that Clyde had much histrionic ability. Nevertheless, he was wonderful! Island dancers in gorgeous cellophane-grass skirts, silver and gold, entertained Eve's guests; softly chanted, sad island songs accompanied the falling-in-love of Eve and Adam. Island black magic was in the villain's schemings. Island scenery, including an incredibly blue ocean backdrop, provided the setting in which the plot unfolded. But Eve's wardrobe was no island product. It was strictly fashion's latest, right out of Vogue and off the Hollywood silver screen. Lakeville had never seen Mavis more alluring. Lakeville sat on the edges of its collective seats, adoring her. Dixie, underneath her efficient manner and crisp, clear lines, sizzled. The whole thing was so obvious. Why, oh, why didn't Clyde get wise? Why did he, seemingly so smart and adult, fall for Mavis Finley's line of charm like any common fish rising to a baited hook? Scene by scene the drama progressed, the plot quickened, the romance moved along. Mavis quick changed from dinner gown to beach togs, to glamorous lounging robe, to a stunning moss-green afternoon suit. She was exquisite in it, when at the last, all obstacles overcome, she stood in Adam's arms, her shiny 664 \ning golden head tilted back, her lips raised for his kiss. Offstage, Dixie turned her face away, her heart aching anew.\nThe curtain came down amid thunderous applause. Twice it rose again while the triumphant lovers—now frankly Mavis and Clyde again—bowed and smiled hand-in-hand and the orchestra played \"Song of the Islands\"; and ushers brought armloads of flowers up the aisle. Then the entire cast grouped themselves downstage for final bows, applause almost bursting the walls.\nDown, up, down, up, the curtain swung—and halted in mid-descent. \"Thespians\" looked puzzledly at each other, as an usher came running up to the stage with a single orchid dripping silver ribbon. He stopped, looking straight at Dixie.... and read from a card: \"To Sally Johnson, the Lakeville Herald's selection as 'Island Hell's' best supporting player. Compliments of Steven Taylor, Editor, and Grant Weber, guest critic.\"\nDIXIE had to step out amid a new thunder of applause, to receive her trophy. Her knees were wobbly from surprise and confusion.\n\"Didn't I tell you? I was sure it would be you!\" she heard Roy Taylor whispering. The curtain was down at last; the players crowded around Dixie exclaiming congratulations.\nThen the babble subsided with a startling suddenness.\n\nAll eyes turned to four persons in the middle of the stage: Mavis, Clyde, Steven Taylor, and the stranger Dixie had noticed earlier.\n\". . . Nice production, Miss Finley. Your play is cleverly written, too. . . . Oh, and where is your little Sally Johnson? I must meet her. She did a very unusual bit, there . . .\"\nEnthusiastic hands were thrust into Dixie towards him, voices, eager but subdued, urged her on: \"Here she is. It's you he wants, Dixie!\"\nDixie found herself among the stellar group in a puzzling unrehearsed epilogue. She still didn't understand what was happening; but she heard Steven Taylor saying, \". . . Dixie, I'm proud to introduce you to my old friend, Grant Weber.\"\nNow it clicked. Grant Weber! Why, of course . . . the New York drama critic! She'd known, vaguely proud, that he was an old friend of Mr. Taylor's. . . . And he'd asked for her—Dixie Allen!\nDumbly she put out her hand to his friendly clasp.\n\"You were great, Miss Allen. All the way through. It isn't often I see so young an actress make an outstanding role of one so insignificant.\"\n\"Why—thank you,\" Dixie stammered. She saw Mavis Finley's smile grow icy, saw little glints of anger in the author-leading lady's eyes.\n\"I'm writing Steven a special review for The Herald,\" Mr. Weber continued, \"and there'll be a good mention for you. You aren't, by any chance, thinking of a stage career?\"\n\"Well, I have thought—\" Dixie wanted, suddenly, to run away, to hide. She was furious with herself. Stuttering like a child! . . . Well, that was exactly what she felt like—a child!\n\"Good, good!\" said the great CURTAIN CALL Weber. \"Look me up when you come to New York. I might be able to help you with some contacts.\" \n\"Oh, thank you—again—\" Dixie exclaimed. Mrs. Weber smiled, turned again to Mavis. \"If I might offer a suggestion to the playwright, why not build up Sally's part? Show a little more revealingly, her hopeless love for Adam; her loyalty to Eve in spite of her own great longing. As it is, it's a bit too subtle for the average playgoer, I'm afraid. Remedy this—and you can, Miss Finley, you write very cleverly—and I'll be happy to recommend your play to an agent I know...\" \nSpotlighted once more, Mavis unfroze immediately. \"You're wonderfully kind, Mr. Weber. I—I was thinking something along the same lines you suggest, and you—your comments are very helpful and encouraging. I do appreciate—everything you've said, and—Dixie—well, we all agree with you about her,\" Mavis concluded archly.\nSomehow, after a time, Dixie was back in the dressing room. Excited chatter bubbled around her. \"You really were marvelous, Dixie. But it took that brilliant Mr. Weber to make us see just how good—\"\nJanice was saying, and Peggy interrupted with \"It just thrilled me, to see Mavis Finley play second fiddle for once! Another orchid to you, Miss Steal-the-Show!\" \n\"But I didn't, really. I didn't mean to—\" She stopped, aghast. She'd almost given herself away. Because that was the truth: she hadn't meant to. She'd had not t 665 the slightest notion that poor Sally had a hopeless passion for Adam Rowe. It had been Dixie Allen's secret love for Clyde Warren, betrayed through Sally! A fine actress she was! She'd better accomplish some growing-up, and learn to keep her personal emotions under her make-up! Thank goodness, since no one knew the truth, everyone would accept Grant Weber's interpretation. Even—Roy. Roy was smart—and she could thank her lucky stars he wasn't smarter still. Roy had thought she was wonderful all the time—bless him! And he was waiting for her, right now...\n\"Dixie! Dixie Allen! Come back from that wool-gathering!\" Janice's raised voice commanded laughingly. \"We're asking a question, you high-hat!\"\n\"What? What? Oh, I'm sorry—\" \n\"Never mind her,\" Peggy said. \"We were just wondering, Dixie. Are you really going to New York?\" \n\"Oh, I... Don't know. Someday, maybe. But I like being here in Lakeville. And I'm not eighteen. Yet; I've lots of time, to think about—Broadway.\" \n\"Gee!\" said Peggy. \"You're so sensible.... I'm afraid, if I were in your place, I'd just up and go.\"\n\"Well... Maybe... But there are—things to consider, Peggy. Excuse me if I seem in a hurry, girls, but I've got a date.\" \n\"Oh, a date!\" Laughing voices repeated the word, chanted it. \"A date, girls. Maybe that explains it!\"\nLaughing back over her shoulder, Dixie hurried away. She felt young and happy and gay; not a care in the world. It was a wonderful feeling. Just wonderful."

The tree was designed and painted in lovely pastel tints by Sister Hazel B. Jones on a large piece of heavy cardboard, size 27\" x 44/7.

For this purpose the five wards were divided into districts and two members of a specially appointed Magazine committee visited each home in the district. Before leaving on their errands the members of the committees met at working sisters' was willingly provided by Relief Society members not serving on the \"calling committees,\" or renewals were not obtained on the first visit, members of the committees made repeat calls until the fine record of 113 per cent had been secured.\nHazel Bertoch—Hercules Ward\nHannah Coon—Spencer Ward\nMyrtle Russon—Pleasant Green Ward\nIzella Jeppson—Magna Ward\nKatie Cahoon, Eva Whittaker, and Anna Petersen—Garfield Ward\nPage 667\nExcerpts from the Woman's Exponent, October 1, and October 15, 1888.\n\"FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ZION AND THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ALL NATIONS\"\nLincoln Park: Lincoln Park, in the Northeastern part of Chicago, borders the lake, with many acres and attractive as any the same from whence it originally derived its name.

The great and mighty revolutions, and the distress of the nations at the present time, are things that we have been looking for. We must be of good cheer, keep the commandments of God, and be sure to have the Spirit as our hand to act a double watch over ourselves, that we do not grieve and lose the Holy Spirit, and drift away into unbelief, but prepare ourselves for what is lying before us, which are days of tribulation, and try to avoid that awful whirlpool into which so many have been led, either by a spirit of doubt and unbelief, or because of transgression, and have sunk to rise no more. Those who bear these things in mind, and are watching the signs of the times will be able to discern between truth and error, and accept their trials as needful lessons, that will add to their store of experience, which in a future day will be of great worth.\n\nHelen Mar Whitney\n\nPage 668\n\nWOMAN'S SPHERE Ramona W.

The mother in the home is busy with fall sewing, with canning and storage of fruits and vegetables, with making plans for the winter comfort and welfare of her family.\n\nThe leisurely and quiet way that autumn comes to the earth is sometimes not reflected in the strenuous days of the homemaker.\n\nYet there is much of steadfast joy that autumn brings in the return of many of our choicest privileges and responsibilities. To the loyal Relief Society member October brings the inspiration of the regular meetings which give her life inspiration, spiritual strength, and a deep sense of the blessed continuity of that which is precious and worthwhile—the lasting treasures that may be found and retained even in this troubled world.\n\nWe return to the sanctuary of the Relief Society room which has meant so much to us; we go back to the joyful privilege of meeting again with women who are united in belief and in purpose. We feel again that comforting sense of belonging, of being active units in a great and growing society—an organization hallowed by more than a century of sisterhood and accomplishment under prophetic direction.\n\nIt is our pleasure and our responsibility to lift our hearts and use our hands to build usefulness and spiritual beauty, to join with our sisters in many lands to fulfill the purposes of Relief Society.\n\nBy regular attendance at all the meetings we enjoy a continuity of interest and an active participation in a varied program designed to enrich our lives and broaden and beautify our personalities. Sometimes it is not alone the activities which we most enjoy that are most necessary to our development. That we may be truly nourished spiritually, aesthetically, socially, and constructively, we need the well-planned enrichment of all phases of Relief Society work. We need the contributions in words and deeds which our sisters give to us willingly and they need the insight and sympathy which we may have to offer.\n\nThe societies which include among the membership older women, and the young mothers, as well, can best achieve the objectives of the organization in group accomplishments and individual growth. Thus the \"give-and-take\" develops most beautifully in a steadfast circle of united sisterhood.\n\nOctober is the time for making our plans for the Relief Society year, for beginning our attendance at meetings, and for joining with our many sisters in the privileges and responsibilities of our great organization.\n\nV.P.\n\nC. The Russells Did Not Go to Church\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nEdith Russell\n\nENGLAND is so rarely prodigal of sunshine, I remember that beautiful morning as though it belonged only to yesterday. The sun spilled gold on the dusty windows of the ugly office building to which I daily turned my steps, and a great armada of white clouds sailed before a stiff breeze blowing in from the North Sea. I had no premonition of what the day might hold, beyond the usual galaxy of accounts, ledgers, the bevy of tired, middle-aged women making their contribution to the war effort, and another evening at home, reading before the fire while my mother knitted and waited expectantly for Antony's step on the path. At the office I took off my coat and prepared for the day.\n\nThe sunshine lighted up the faces of my \"school\" of women; there were some eager and animated, others who were anxious and old. I knew how it felt when letters from the front were delayed. As I smiled and said \"Good morning,\" the door of the classroom opened to admit the elderly person of the office manager followed by a younger and vigorous man in his late twenties.\n\n\"Good morning, Miss Russell,\" the manager said. \"Please to meet Mr. Gregory Miner, late of the King's Own Royal Rifles. I wish you would be good enough to give him some insight as to the function of your school. He is to learn the business and will need to know.\"\n\nMr. Miner bowed. He was possessed of a fine healthy color, a somewhat stocky physique, and he exuded an atmosphere of fastidious cleanliness. I liked him at once, and as soon as the manager had retired, I gave him into the charge of a nice homely matron, at whose desk I could conveniently observe and instruct him.\n\nI was near enough to see that on his left hand he wore a most peculiar ring—a great silver Indian head—a rather vulgar trinket, I thought, on the person of an Englishman. It flashed in the sunlight and I wondered why he wore it and from where it came. It seemed a trifle incongruous compared to the quiet conservative quality of the rest of his appearance.\n\nA little before lunch I approached his desk to inquire after his progress.\n\n\"The ring flashed silver in the morning sun, and, smiling, he covered it with his hand. I smiled, too.\n\n\"What an unusual ring!\" I remarked, and he lifted it for my examination.\n\n\"But here is one even more unusual,\" he volunteered, and from his pocket he withdrew a dull gold object, shaped like a shield and covered with peculiar hieroglyphics I could not understand. It was not vulgar like the Indian head, but apparently this was not valued for its ornamentation, but for something deeper and more significant.\n\n\"This ring,\" said Gregory Miner, \"I won for achieving.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" I replied, \"What exactly do you mean—achieving? Achieving what?\"\n\nREGORY Miner seemed to inhale a deep breath. \"Miss Russell,\" he said, and his eyes looked directly into mine, \"what do you think of a Church which has for one of its maxims, 'The glory of God is intelligence?'\"\n\nThe room, filled with thirty women industriously engaged with accounts and figures, endured one of its rare moments of silence. I could hear the old office clock ticking on the wall and for some reason I thought of time and its relation to eternity. I had a momentary and entirely incomprehensible vision of the vicarage at St. Matthews and a woman called Hannah Shuttleworth with her illegitimate child, then a peculiar sensation of warmth suffused my whole being, the same one feels on beholding an old and intimate friend with a familiar greeting on his lips.\n\nI gave Gregory Miner look for look.\n\n\"I knew I wasn't wrong,\" he said, and my heart gave a great bound as though for a moment it had almost ceased to beat for fear I should give any other answer but this. Gregory Miner smiled, too, also with relief.\n\n\"I knew I wasn't wrong,\" he said. \"What Church is this to which you refer?\"\n\nI wanted to know. \"The Church of Jesus Christ of No? You have Well, then the He Latter-day Saints. Not heard of it? Mormon Church, perhaps?\" regarded me quizzically.\n\nI believe I made a reply, but actually I was no longer in that dusty office schoolroom. I was six years removed, watching Michael, my brother, waiting for him to pick up a book my mother had forbidden; a book in which were lurid tales about a strange people called Mormons.\n\nThat evening I was home late for dinner. The hungry Antony whooped for joy when I entered the cottage, but my mother was concerned lest my delay had been occasioned by anything disastrous.\n\n\"Of course not, darling,\" I reassured her, as we sat down. \"As a matter of fact—\"\n\nI was magnificently offhand—\n\n\"As a matter of fact, I have been talking to a Mormon in town.\"\n\n\"You have been—what?\" Horror expressed itself in every line of my mother's features.\n\nAntony helped himself to more vegetables and inquired: \"You mean he was in a circus, or something?\"\n\nI could feel my mother's eyes fixed upon me, but I avoided them and waived Antony's question.\n\n\"He is a very charming fellow, Mother,\" I said anxiously. \"I feel sure he is perfectly respectable. He is being taught the business at the office. And he—he has only one wife.\"\n\nI was concentrating upon the food on my plate. I heard my mother say in a cold, shocked voice: \"How do you know?\"\n\nI took a deep breath.\n\n\"Because I asked him,\" I said, and my face burned at the memory. I was dreadfully conscious—that somewhere in this innocent conversation THE RUSSELLS DID NOT GO TO CHURCH lay an issue so great I was afraid even to contemplate it.\n\nI lifted my eyes to meet those of my mother.\n\nA \"Perhaps Antony will bring in the dessert,\" she said, \"I think we have all had enough of _ this course.\"\n\nMiserably, I looked at her face. How I hated to feel her disapproval. Why did I not simply laugh and tell her that if I met a thousand Mormons, it was a matter of no consequence? Why? Why? Why?\n\nTHE NEXT few weeks passed in a strange atmosphere of discovery. The young Mr. Miner was an assiduous missionary. Every day brought new explorations into the strange new world of religion. There were obstacles, of course, mental and aesthetic obstacles; a Prophet who was an American; who spoke in the same idiom as that of the cinema, and other facts at first disconcerting to me.\n\nAnd, always, on the face of the\n\nI told her, one evening, that I would be baptized. She said nothing at first, think you might—come to 'the Church and see me—see me baptized?\"\n\nHer look froze me.\n\nCome to see you baptized,\" she said with such \"I didn't do want 673 I will have no part in it.\n\nEver since I am ashamed of you now. I don't wish to refer to the matter again, have written to Michael as I feel he should know.\" I went out and walked through the village, up the hill towards beautiful old St. Matthews. It lay there, the Gothic beauty church struck me afresh, seemed to address itself to me in a poignant appeal. But it isn't any use, I gave answer. You only have a part of the truth. I love—and always shall—your turrets and your bells, and your windows—but I can't feed the soul of me on these alone. That's why I'm leaving you—for something whole and complete. I came to you, once, looking for God—remember? I found him—in part. But I'm greedy. A part isn't enough. So—I'm following my Star... 0\n\nA week later, the day of my baptism dawned. I was to be baptized in the afternoon at three, and in the morning, at the office, Mr. Miner asked me concerning my mother. \"She will be in church to see you baptized,\" he assured me, confidently. I laughed, derisively. He didn't know my mother. He didn't know that the Russells did not go to church. He had no conception of the extent of my disloyalty.\n\n674\n\nLuncheon, at home, that day, was an awkward session. Excitement had taken away my appetite, but I strove to eat so as not to irritate my mother further. Antony, intrigued by thoughts of someone having the temerity to \"duck\" his sister, asked embarrassing questions throughout the meal. But at last it was over. I escaped to my room and put the few things I should need into my bag. I could hear my mother dressing in her room. \"I'm going, Mother!\" I called. \"Goodbye!\" Her voice, a little strained and unfamiliar, came back to me. \"Wait for me! I'm going into the city, too. We may as well go together.\" She appeared a moment later, and without further conversation, we went out into the street where the bus was waiting. The vehicle was very full and, though we sat together, we did not talk. My thoughts were filled with the wonder of what was going to happen to me. A part of me ached for the sweet woman beside me, but withal, I was gloriously happy.\n\nAs the Church came into view, I rose to my feet and turned to my mother. \"Goodbye, darling...\" She, too, was on her feet. '\"Mumsie, where�?\" \"Hurry,\" she said. Stopping.\" A moment later, we stood together on the pavement—a pavement suddenly paved with gold. The bus swung away, Citywards. '\"Mumsie—where are you going?\" Incredulity was in my voice. A sob, too, I couldn't help it. I didn't care. \"Going?\" Incredulity was in my mother's voice, too. \"Why? I'm going to Church!\" Bless her dear heart, she was as surprised as I was! \"But�\" I was staring, dumfounded. \"I know—the Russells.\" My mother actually laughed and the sound rang in my heart like a peal of bells.

They meet Mother MacKinlay' and her son Bob, whom they had known while doing missionary work, and become acquainted with Kathleen Coleman and her friend Margaret Purvis. Hugh and Kathleen are married on board the ship. While in Iowa preparing for the handcart journey across the plains, Margaret tells Mother Mac that she is in love with Andrew, and Kathleen tells the two women that she is expecting a baby. While crossing the plains, Andrew is lost in a blizzard and is rescued by Margaret. She later leaves the Macs and goes to live in Tooele. The others later arrive in Zion. Kathleen and Hugh have a son and name him Mac Coleman Shand. Andrew farms and saves money to bring his family from Scotland. When he finally sends it, he receives news that Jane has married someone else. Andrew is a grieved and lonely man and he sends for his small brother and sister instead.\n\nFROM the very first day Andrew went to see the Hunters, he had been interested in wool—it may have been because his mother worked in it at home. When the snow was too deep for timbering he spent his time, after the chores were all completed, carding wool. Sister Hunter made the soap for washing the wool, soaked it in many waters in a vat especially made for that purpose, washed it, rinsed it, and put it out in the shade to dry. After picking and carding the soft white wool into batts for quilts, or spinning it into yarn, she knit the family's underwear, socks, and stockings. Sometimes she dyed the wool into beautiful colors and knit sweaters and fascinators for her daughters and soft warm shawls for herself and friends.\n\nPage 676\n\nWith the waste she made rugs for the floor. Many people wanted her to process their wool but she never found time, so Andrew decided wool-processing would be a good business for him. He built a lean-to on the cabin and went to work. He had woven too many dreams into the river bottoms and the forest—dreams which would never be fulfilled—to return to them. Processing wool would be advantageous for a number of reasons. He would be at home to take care of the bairns—his brother and sister—when they arrived. He could catch up with his Church work. He was making up for lost time now.\n\nWhen there was no special activity planned in the ward, he went out to visit the sick, to encourage and help the poor, and to teach the gospel. He had wanted to build a fence around his lot with the logs which he had cut when he was timbering, but he hadn't found time. Now he decided to finish up a lot of odd jobs around his home.\n\nThe bairns came that fall in time for school. They brought love and comfort to their brother's heart, and sunshine to the cabin. He desired his training to be just as profitable to them as had been his mother's love, patience, and sacrifice to him. She had been father and mother to ten, so he felt that surely he could take care of two.\n\nAll preparations for the winter were completed. The shelves and root cellar were full of food. His yard was stacked high with good wood to burn. He called on him for a few days at the mill; was asked to go out and talk to the people about buying stock in the factory company. Plans were made to organize a Co-Operative Store in Resplendence.\n\nAs Brother Rumgay's responsibility in the bishopric was to look after the young people, he didn't settle long in any one place. Thanksgiving was the end of all winter activities in—people entertained themselves at the meetinghouse. They had programs of various kinds, operas, home dramatics, and dances. Often there were sleigh-riding parties; their favorite entertainment was the supper dance. They would all gather at some home for a hot cooked supper; then they would go to the meetinghouse for a program and dance.\n\nAt holiday time they decorated the ward house and planned entertainment for every night in the week between Christmas and New Year's. Mother invited all the Macs to spend the day with her. After dinner, they had a sacred program, in keeping with the occasion. Mother read the Christmas story from the Bible; Hugh led in singing Christmas carols; Brother Coleman played classical music on his violin; the bairns gave a dialogue.\n\nBob presented a short talk on gifts: \"I'm going to tell you how the MacKinlays received their greatest gift of all. My father was the only one in several generations who did not join the dominant church of Scotland. He wanted to wait and join the true Church. One day, father was walking down the streets of Cowdenbeath. A gentle breeze was blowing. It blew a piece of white paper right into father's path. It fell at his feet. He picked it up and read the announcement of a Mormon meeting to be held in Cowdenbeath.\n\nFather attended the meeting and knew from the first the young missionaries were preaching the truth. He studied their literature and prayed to his Heavenly Father and received a strong testimony. He applied for baptism, and soon mother joined him. This is how we received our very greatest gift. It was a wonderful Christmas. New Year's was the day the Scots celebrated in the old country.\n\nAndrew had suffered a lot of bad luck the past year, and Mother was eager to help a wee trifle to bring good luck to him in the new year. She got Bob out of his bed early, and dressed up in Sunday clothes and new shoes, she sent him along to Andrew's with a basket filled to the brim with every good thing to eat.\n\nAndrew insisted on Bob's coming in and eating a bite of breakfast, then he sent Bob back to his mother's with the basket filled to the brim again. No bad luck would visit the Rumgays and MacKinlays—Bob had taken care of that. A dark-complexioned boy—with guid clothes and new shoes, carrying something filled to the brim—brought good luck. Mother felt just a wee bit easier when she thought of Andrew's situation.\n\nSpring came early. The women were doing their housecleaning and their sewing; the men building and repairing fences. The wool business was successful. Andrew, with the help of his brother and sister, Bill and Janet, had more work than they could do. One evening in April all the Macs dropped by Andrew's house for a little visit.\n\nAs they were finishing supper, a knock came on the door. Bill answered. It was the bishop, his second counselor, and the ward clerk—Andrew's fellow workers, calling. They talked about the crops and the weather. Then Andrew asked them why they were calling, as only the night before they had met in bishop's meeting.\n\nAndrew was a little curious and a little anxious. He wondered if they intended to release him. The bishop paused thoughtfully for a few moments, then explained, \"Brother Rumgay, we are calling you on a mission to Scotland, if it can be arranged. The ward has some missionary funds you would be welcome to use.\"\n\n\"A mission!\" Mother exclaimed, \"surely, Bishop, you do not joke about such sacred matters.\" \"We are not joking. We were never more serious in our lives. Well, Brother Rumgay, what have you to say?\" \"A mission!\" Andrew spoke slowly, weighing every word. \"I hadn't thought about it, but it's what I do want more than anything else in the world. I found something on the plains, something priceless. I would like to share it with my loved ones and friends.\"\n\n\"We thought as much,\" returned the bishop. \"Now we will leave you to do your planning. It can be worked out.\"\n\nThe Macs were dumfounded. \"And Andrew just after telling us he never wanted to cross the plains again,\" Brother Coleman laughingly expressed himself.\n\n\"And the bairns just arrived,\" Mother added. \"Andrew must go on his mission. But how?\" the Macs questioned.\n\nBill and Janet complicated the picture. Their brother wanted them to stay at home and not add more responsibility for Kathleen and Mother. He did not want to take them back to Scotland as they loved the new country and were doing so well in school. Mother studied a long time, and then thought she had the solution.\n\n\"Maybe it will work out,\" she said, \"maybe it won't—if it does, it is the one way out and the only way that I can see.\"\n\n\"Don't keep us in suspense, Mother,\" Andrew anxiously pleaded.\n\nMother looked around at all her companions. Strange that not one of them had thought about the missing member of the Macs.\n\n\"Why Margaret, to be sure. Don't tell me you've all forgotten her.\" \"Margaret,\" slowly Kathleen spoke. \"That's the most beautiful name and the most beautiful person I have ever known. Oh! I'm getting so lonesome to see her.\" \"That's it,\" Andrew spoke up quickly, \"Margaret is maybe just as lonesome for Kathleen and Mother. If she is, she will come.\"\n\nQUESTING LIGHTS ARGARET was very anxious to see the Macs again. The Stuarts had made her as welcome as one of their own, yet the years had been long and very trying since she parted with the Macs on the plains. She had tried to convince herself that work was the solution to all her problems. If she worked hard enough, eventually it would blot out and she would become interested in new people and new places. She knew now this wasn't true. Her anticipation of meeting the Macs thrilled her as nothing had done since she left them.\n\nMother and Bob went to Tooele to bring Margaret to Resplendence. The day she arrived had been set apart for celebrating. Mother had insisted on them killing all the pullets, because, after all, she might not be able to buy cayenne pepper. Andrew's missionary party was to be held at the meetinghouse that night.\n\nMargaret helped Kathleen cook the supper, setting the table with Mother's best dishes. She wore a pale blue dress with a fitted basque, full sleeves, and a long billowy skirt. The basque had a curved neckline and a vestee of fine, cream-colored lace. Her long black hair was plaited and wrapped around her head. She wore her mother's cameo, gold and black earrings, and lovely flowers in her hair.\n\nMother Mac's description of her was perfect—slim and trim. The door opened and Andrew walked in. \"Margaret, let me look at you, young lady! Why, you're beautiful! Twice as beautiful as you were when you left us on the Plains. You're good, too! Thanks 679 for 'making my mission possible,' I am sure the Lord will know it is your contribution as well as mine,\" Andrew spoke from a full heart.\n\n\"I wanted you to go on your mission, Andrew. It is your opportunity to offer our kinsmen the gospel, with the wonderful blessings we have all received,\" Margaret spoke quietly. \"It took a lot of faith and courage to accept a mission when I had a young brother and sister to take care of, but the bishop said it could be arranged, and now it is. The bairns are going to love you, Margaret! I hope you can learn to love them.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I can,\" she said. \"Leave it to us and the Lord.\" \"Oh, Margaret, you are wonderful!\" Hugh called on Andrew regarding a detail of the program for his farewell party. While they talked, Margaret sat beside Mother Mac and covertly studied the face of Andrew. He had not been well when she left him on the plains, but she was hardly prepared for what she saw in him tonight.\n\nA spirit of righteous indignation rose in her heart against Jane Allison. Andrew was pale and nervous, yet she was sure the Macs hadn't noticed it because he had managed every day to do his full share of all the work. Margaret believed that God had called Andrew on this mission, and she decided that there would be no home worries for the young man while he was away. She would take care of that.\n\nMargaret bowed her head and silently prayed that Andrew would be brought safely back to her.\n\nShe remembered the tree in tears on the plains and wiped her eyes.\nThey all had a wonderful time at the party which was planned like the Scotch entertainment on shipboard. Janet and Bill danced the \"Highland Fling\" and \"Sword Dance.\"\nAndrew was different tonight—very different. He was happy, more like his old self than he had been in months. His friends thought it was the mission. He had the Macs wondering.\nThe bishop was anxious for Andrew to get started on his way to Scotland. It had been a long time since a missionary had left Resplendence, but Andrew waited while the bairns became acquainted with Margaret (because she wanted it that way), and Margaret became acquainted with the wool.\nBut before many months the young man was calling for his mail at King's Kettle.\n(To be continued)\n\nWALK WITH ME\nEvelyn Fjeldsted\n\nI am going for a walk today; Will you come along with me?  \nTo follow trails through pasture lands And rest beside the old pine tree;  \nOut where wild rose seed pods shine Like rubies in the sun's blue light—  \nWhere limpid streams move listlessly And blackbirds whir in sudden flight;  \nWhere burnished sheaves from stacks that rise Like heaps of gold—a priceless yield?  \nLet us lose our cares, just for today And glean the beauty of the field.\n\nAUTUMN NIGHT\nMarijane Morris\n\nTonight there is a shadow stealth  \nUpon the huddled harvest fields.  \nThe corn leaves fall again tonight With waiting, silent fodder shields.  \nAbove discordant, honking geese, The moon is gowned in garnered gold.  \nShe floats beyond the windmill's vanes, The clutch both firm and deathly cold.  \nTonight there is a death abroad, A crackling, necromantic time,  \nWhile harvest golds and crimsons die A startled death too soon . . . too soon.\n\nWho does this bloom of summer go When autumn leaves dance in the air?  \nDoes earth take back what she has borne To gladden hearts some otherwhere?"

    "content": "Braided Rugs Are Beautiful\nDelma Peterson\n\nRelief Society women have many hobbies which give them the satisfaction of personal accomplishment and the joy of helping others. Some of these hobbies appeal particularly to women who love to make their homes beautiful and at the same time exercise their capabilities in being masters of the ways of thrift. Marie C. Jacobsen of Richfield, Utah, has turned her artistic abilities and her homemaking skill to a most pleasing and useful hobby. She makes braided rugs—not just the ordinary hit-and-miss, hurry-up kind—but works of art which reveal color harmony and expert workmanship. She makes large rugs and small rugs, round rugs and oval ones—rugs suitable for any and every room in the house. She has made two large tugs, twelve feet in diameter, and numerous small ones. And what is more pleasing in a home than a shining polished floor set off with a large, colorful braided rug—or more charmingly useful than a small rug placed where many footsteps pass?\n\nIn the first place, in her rug making activities, Mrs. Jacobsen uses only materials that are not required or necessary for other purposes. Many articles, such as old bedspreads, cushion covers, draperies, which many women discard, may appear as new and colorful strands in a rag rug, especially when faded colors are dyed into rich, bright tints. Using four strands of rags, Mrs. Jacobsen sews the various lengths together with strong thread as she braids, carefully selecting colors for harmony and the weights and widths of strands which will work in evenly. There is a very special \"knack\" of holding the strands at the proper tension, not too loose and not too tight, so that the rug, when finished, will lie flat.\n\nMrs. Jacobsen, wife of M. O. Jacobsen, and mother of two children, was born in Denmark in 1878 and came with her parents to America in 1888. She has lived in Richfield for thirty-nine years, actively serving Relief Society and lending her support to Church and community projects which have uplifted and benefited the community. During the war, Mrs. Jacobsen used another of her hobbies to advantage—she knit for the Red Cross eighty pairs of bed socks and twenty-five sweaters. 'Truly it can be said of her, she \"eateth not the bread of idleness.\"\n\nPage 681\n\nSELECTED DATA\nAnnual Report – 1947\nMargaret C. Pickering, General Secretary-Treasurer\n\nThe following pages illustrate the record of service and achievement of Relief Society for 1947—the one hundredth anniversary of the Church's home in the West. We are pleased to include reports from the Czechoslovakian, East German, and Netherlands Missions, the first received since 1938, due to war conditions.\n\nThe following brief summary shows the membership trends in twenty-five year periods:\n\nDuring the first twenty-five years (1847-1872) Relief Society work was carried on by a few scattered organizations. In 1867 Brigham Young instructed all bishops to establish Relief Societies in their wards and by 1872 the membership had reached approximately 10,000.\n\nDuring the following twenty-five years (1872-1897) stake units were created (the first being in Weber in 1877). Interest in Relief Society work was stimulated generally so that by 1897 the membership had reached about 20,000.\n\nDuring the period 1897-1922 uniform courses of study and regular weekly meetings were established which greatly accelerated growth to a membership of 53,412.\n\nFrom 1922 to 1947 the society achieved its major growth as noted in the accompanying chart, a peak of 115,015 being attained in 1941 in anticipation of Relief Society's Centennial in 1942. From 1942 to late 1945 many women were engaged in war work which prevented them being active in Relief Society, but during 1946, the first postwar year, the membership increased 4107, and in 1947, Utah's Centennial year, the membership increased 6,045, a ten per cent increase in two years, making a total of 111,843 members at the end of 1947. This increase in membership is a welcome and heartening attainment and the corresponding increase in all phases of Relief Society work is equally gratifying.\n\nThe outstanding activity of 1947 was the launching of the fund-raising program for a Relief Society building to be erected as a permanent home for the organization in Salt Lake City. The plan, announced at the annual Relief Society conference in October, is to be completed in one year.\n\nFollowing the Nauvoo period, from a small nucleus in Utah and neighboring territories the organization has spread over much of the civilized world. With the establishment of new stakes and new missions and the re-opening of foreign missions, Relief Society looks forward to sharing its blessings and benefits with increasingly greater numbers of women in many lands.\n\nTo all Relief Society workers, past and present, whose vision and devotion have made possible Relief Society's notable achievement of the past one hundred years the present general board expresses its sincere appreciation and deep gratitude.  \nIllustrated by Dorothy Platt Handley\n\nPage 682\n\nANNUAL REPORT – 1947\nTRENDS in the accompanying chart show the growth of Relief Society during its 100 years in the West. Following an intensive membership campaign in 1941, when a sudden peak of 115,015 members was reached, there was a decline.\n\n6,045 more join with us...\nANNUAL REPORT – 1947\n\nIn 1946 membership resumed its steady growth commensurate with the increase in Latter-day Saint families—heading toward the goal of every Latter-day Saint woman a member.\nThe percentage of members active in leadership indicates the strength and vitality of any organization. Note that while leadership activity obviously could not keep pace with the sudden growth in 1941, its ratio to membership otherwise has been maintained.\n\n[Chart showing membership growth from 1847 to 1947 with data points at: 1847 1872 1897 1922 1947\nThe chart shows increasing membership over time, with markers for:\n* MEMBERS\n* L.D.S.

Talmage) For Tuesday, January 4, 1949 Objective: To strengthen faith in the Lord Jesus Christ through the recognition of his power over the forces of nature, of men, and even of demons. Note: All quotations which are not followed by references are taken from the text Jesus the Christ. It is suggested that during the meeting at which this lesson is considered, the members _ sing, \"Master, the Tempest Is Raging,\" Deseret Sunday School Songs, page 204. Toward evening on the day that Jesus had first used parables in his teaching, he suggested to his disciples that they cross to the east side of the Sea of Galilee. No doubt, he was weary and wanted to get away from the multitudes for awhile. Before the trip commenced a certain scribe said unto Jesus, \"... Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest\" (Matt. 8:18). It was a plain bid for official recognition on the part of one of the ruling class. However, Jesus does not call those to office who seek positions. His policy was announced on another occasion as, \"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you...\" (John 15:16). He had thus chosen the Twelve. The offer of the scribe was not accepted. While the gospel is for all, those who officiate in its sacred work must be called of God. In two other instances on that day the Lord taught great lessons concerning the need for a willingness to sacrifice on the part of those who accept calls to the ministry. One man who had volunteered to follow the Master if permitted first to go home and bury his father, was told, \"... Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.\" Another man who wanted to be a disciple requested time to go home and bid farewell to his friends. \"And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God\" (Luke 9:57-62). In both cases, the answers may seem harsh. However, the Lord knew what was in their hearts. The work of the ministry was largely spiritual. Let those who were spiritually dead or negligent bury the dead. Those who had been set apart to the service of the Master had pressing duties to perform.\nLESSON DEPARTMENT Stilling the Storm\nLet us return now to the trip\nacross the lake. Some of the multitude\ntried to follow, in small boats,\nthe ship in which Jesus set sail. He\nfound a place near the stern of the\nsmall vessel and soon fell asleep. It\nis well known that violent storms\nfrequently arise on the Sea of Galilee.\nOn this occasion, a great storm\nsoon overtook the ship in which the\njourney was being made. Jesus was\nsubject to fatigue and on this night\nslept soundly. His day's work was\ndone, he could sleep. Soon, however,\nthe frightened disciples awakened\nhim with the cry, \"Lord, save us: we perish\"; and, \"Master, carest thou not that we perish?\" Their terrified appeal was not wholly devoid of hope nor barren of faith:\nAnd he saith unto them, \"Why are ye fearful? . . . How is it that ye have no faith?\" Times we wonder why we cannot have more faith. It is comforting to know that others have cried, \"Lord save us.\" It is still more comforting to know that even now he hears us. If only we could have more faith, the winds and waves of our troubled souls would be still. Lord, teach us to have more faith.\nThis miracle of the Christ has\ncaused more comment, perhaps, than\nany other. It does prove he has control\nover the forces of nature.\nFor by him were all things created, that\nare in heaven, and that are in earth, visible\nand invisible, whether they be thrones,\nor dominions, or principalities, or powers:\nall things were created by him, and for\nhim: . . . For it pleased the Father that\nin him should all fulness dwell (Col. 1:16,\n19).\nThe Lord does, and will have\ncomplete control over the earth itself.\nPaul states:\nBecause the creature itself [meaning the\nearth] also shall be delivered from the\nbondage of corruption into the glorious\nliberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groaneth\nand travaileth in pain together until now\n(Romans 8:21-22).\nThere are many references in the\nscriptures to a time when the elements\nwill be melted by fire and\nthe earth will pass away and we will\nhave a new earth. This change is\nlikened unto a transfiguration\n(D. & C. section 63:20-21. See also\nsection 88:25-27). Jesus is the God\nof this land (Ether 2:12). He created\nthis earth, under the direction\nof his Father, and, therefore, does\nspeak to the winds, the sea, and\neverything in the earth, and they\nQuieting the Demons\nShortly after the stilling of the\nstorm, Jesus and his party landed on\nthe eastern side of the lake. Matthew\ntells us (8:28-29) that, as they\nlanded, \"there met him two\npossessed with devils.\" One of them,\nespecially, terrified the neighborhood\nwith his weird shrieks. Because\nof his mania, he was so strong he\nhad broken his fetters and fled to\nthe mountains where he lived in\nthe caves. However, when he saw\nthe Lord, he prostrated himself and\ncried: \"What have I to do with thee,\nJesus, thou Son of the most high\nGod?\" (Mark 5:7). Notice how\nthe devils recognized the Master.\nCHRIST RAISING THE DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS Page 698 LESSON DEPARTMENT \". . . the devils also believe, and tremble\" (Jas. 2:19). The demons by whom the man was possessed recognized the Lord. They had known him before that day. They knew that some time Satan will be \"bound and cast into the bottomless pit\" for a thousand years.\nOn this occasion Jesus inquired, \"What is thy name?\" The reply is significant, \"My name is Legion: for we are many\" (Mark 5:9). The devils implored that they be not banished. They were given permission to enter the bodies of swine and did so; and the whole herd of hogs�about two thousand�stampeded and ran into the sea and were drowned. To see the once-wild man restored to health, and to hear what happened, greatly astounded the people. They were afraid of the Lord and pleaded with him to leave their country.\n\nWicked people could not stand to be in his presence, if they could avoid it.\nThe man who had been healed, or rid of the demons, was told by Jesus to go to his friends and tell them the great things the Lord had done for him. The man was full of gratitude and became a missionary. Wherever he went he told of the marvelous things Jesus had done for him.\nIn this one short journey across the Sea of Galilee many mighty works had been done. He had shown his power over the elements, had cast out demons, and had called at least one grateful, efficient missionary.\nThe Raising of the Daughter of Jairus\nWhen the Lord returned to Capernaum, great crowds of people were waiting for him. As soon as he landed, Jesus was asked by Jairus, one of the local rulers among the Jews, to go and lay hands upon his sick daughter. Said Jairus, \". . . My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live\" (Mark 5:23). This father, though a ruler, came with faith and trust. His only daughter, a girl of twelve years, was dying, \"is even now dead,\" he said.\nOn the road to the home of Jairus a very unusual incident occurred. The people thronged about Jesus. In the crowd was a woman who had been sorely afflicted for twelve years. Doctors had been unable to cure her. She pushed her way through the crowd and touched his robe. She said, \"If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.\" She tried to withdraw unnoticed but Jesus turned and asked, \"Who touched me?\" Peter replied, \"Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?\" The Lord said, \"Somebody hath touched me; for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.\" The woman, notwithstanding her fear, came forward and kneeling before the Lord confessed that it was she. He assured her in kindly tones that her faith had made her whole. A study of this incident convinces us that the power to heal was inherent in the Lord Jesus to be \"exercised at his will, and as the influence of faith might call it forth.\" Let us remember his saying \"Thy faith hath made thee whole\" (Luke 8:43-48).\nRemember, the woman was healed as Jesus was on the road to the house of Jairus. Jairus had shown no impatience at the delay. He trusted the Lord. Even before they reached the home, word reached them that the little girl was dead. Jesus spoke reassuringly to the father, \"Be not afraid, only believe.\" Only three of the apostles, Peter, James, and John, and the parents, were permitted to go with the Lord into the death chamber. Taking the young girl by the hand he said to her, \"Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.\" The girl arose and was well. Jesus directed that food be given her as her body needed it. This, it must be remembered, was a case of calling back to life from death, not a case of resurrection (Mark 5:35-43).\nRestoration of Life and Resurrection\nThere is a vital distinction between restoring from death to life and a resurrection of the body to a condition of immortality. Jesus was \"the first fruits of them that slept.\" He was the first being ever to be resurrected. In all instances prior to his resurrection, the reuniting of the spirit and body was merely a commutation of mortal existence. Jesus controls both life and death. Faith in him brings the desired blessing: Passive belief on the part of a would-be recipient of blessing is insufficient; only when it is vitalized into active faith is it a power; so also of one who ministers in the authority given of God, mental and spiritual energy must be operative if the service is to be effective.\nSpace will not permit giving in this lesson more of the miracles of the Lord. He opened the eyes of the blind, and caused them to see. He healed those who were deaf and those who were defective of speech. It is interesting to note that in these instances Jesus ministered by some \"physical contact in addition to uttering the authoritative words of command or assurance.\" He anointed one man's eyes with clay; on the eyes of another he applied saliva; he put his fingers into the ears of another, or touched the tongue, as the case needed. He healed by a power that was his own. In this, our day, he has directed that we anoint with holy, consecrated oil as did the apostles of old (Mark 6:13).\nQuestions and Suggestions for Discussion\n1. Why are self-seeking persons not appointed to office in the Church?\n2. Describe the miracle of Christ stilling the tempest.\n3.

Wayne Driggs\nFor Tuesday, January 4, 1949\nObjective: To give encouragement to face the coming year courageously,\nThe turn of the year we might well recall these words spoken by the Savior: \"In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer.\" What cheer can there be in tribulation? How can one take comfort in the thought of misery or suffering? Can it be that life to be good must also be evil?\nFor one who has not lived understandingly, under the promptings of the \"spirit,\" these questions seem unanswerable. Today, through the light of modern scriptures, we may know, however, that there is real purpose in life. That even the bitter experiences in living can add the somber tones which but serve to highlight the brighter joys.\nWhat true Latter-day Saints must learn to see in day-by-day patterns, is their ultimate goal. Again and again in the Book of Mormon we read words of understanding and encouragement explaining the seeming paradoxes of life. \"But behold,\" says Lehi, \"all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things. Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy\" (2 Nephi 2:24-25). When we learn this lesson then \"joy\" like \"cheer\" reflects the deeper significance.\n'The sacrifice of parents for children, the long road to relieve a suffering friend, the bittersweet hours that slip away in the passing of a loved one—these, and the myriads of other hard moments that crowd a full life, can only be sustained by an unfaltering trust in the Master's over-all purposes.\n\nBy living righteously we may be of good cheer both in the present and in the future, sustained by the knowledge that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that all things work out for our ultimate good. Thus, though tribulation must be with us here, we realize its darker side is towards the earth, not heaven. \"In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer\" (John 16:33). \n\nREMEMBER THE BIRTHDAYS OF WOMEN IN YOUR FAMILY WITH A SUBSCRIPTION TO THEAN ATTRACTIVE GIFT CARD WILL BE SENT TO RECIPIENTS OF GIFT SUBSCRIPTIONS.\n\nAddress: TheBishop's Building, Salt Lake City 1, Utah \n\nWork Meeting - Sewing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting)\nLesson 4 - Salvage from Shirts Jean Ridges Jennings\n\nFor Tuesday, January 11, 1949\n\nEN'S shirts, like their suits, frequently become shabby and wear out in strategic points long before their full value is exhausted. The collars and cuffs become frayed and they frequently pull out at the armholes, but the main body of the shirts can still stand more wear. If the material seems weak all over, then it is a waste of time and energy to remake them. But when the shirt as a whole is sturdy, many useful things can be done with it. There is a surprising amount of yardage to be found in a man's shirt. The fabric is usually fine, soft, and closely woven. These features, together with attractiveness of color and print, recommend them for remodeling into children's clothes.\n\nLogically, the first use that comes to mind is merely re-making the shirt into a smaller size for a boy. In this case try to take advantage, as much as possible, of the tail of the shirt which gets the least wear, for the parts of the boy's shirt which get the most wear, namely the collar and sleeves. Other children's clothing such as sun suits, pinafores and aprons can be constructed from shirts, colored ones being used for play clothes for little girls, and for play trousers, with a bib, for little boys. Attractive butcher-boy smocks, to be worn with contrasting slacks can be fashioned for little girls, using the stripes in different directions for trim. For the teen-age girl lovely blouses can be made in the Gibson girl styles. Many attractive combinations can be fashioned by using plain white shirts along with striped or colored ones.\n\nHave a _ tucked white bosom front and cuffs and collar on a solid color blouse. Or reverse the procedure and have striped trim on a white blouse. The young housewife and mother can fashion innumerable useful and attractive aprons. A shirt lends itself better to a style with a waist band and attached bib or merely a front apron type, since the usable length of a shirt is rarely over thirty inches. By combining the available material of the shirt with color, bias, rick rack or even eyelet embroidery, the possibilities are unlimited.\n\nTo this list of suggestions add numerous items such as sunbonnets for the little girls, petticoats, panties, and even the popular camisole, and we have a vista of make-overs to challenge the ingenuity of any clever woman.\n\nLESSON DEPARTMENT 703\n\nLiterature - Literature of the Latter-day Saints\nLiterature of the Gospel Restoration. Lesson 4 - Words of Light and Truth from the Prophet Elder Howard R. Driggs\n\nFor Tuesday, January 18, 1949\n\nJoseph Smith was the first great interpreter in these latter days of the gospel, which with the help of the Lord and Savior, of Moroni and other holy men, he restored. In addition to the Book of Mormon, which he said is \"the keystone of our religion,\" and the Doctrine and Covenants which is the revealed word of God to this Prophet, there are many sayings and sermons of this great leader which add new light and truth. These help us understand more clearly the plan of salvation; and further, they bring us closer to the spirit and power and kindly nature of \"the man who communed with Jehovah.\"\n\nIn a helpful little book called Joseph Smith's Teachings - a compilation by Edwin F. Parry from the authorized History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, known as the Documentary History of the Church (D. H. C.), are many illuminating utterances of the Prophet - taken from his sermons and informal discussions, as nearly as his scribes in longhand could record his words.\n\nIn this study let us center attention on some of these typical selections to get not only spiritual upbuilding, but also for appreciation of the direct, vibrant, lucid style in which the great leader portrayed truth and wisdom.\n\nAn excellent first example - and this came from his pen - will be found in our \"Articles of Faith.\" For straightforward, orderly composition - clear, concrete, and comprehensive - this religious statement is outstanding. Moreover, the language has a natural rhythm which lends itself to good oral reading and memorizing. In a word, the \"Articles of Faith\" have high literary quality.\n\nJoseph Smith wrote and spoke without ostentation. He wasted no words; truth to him was of first importance. Further, he seemed to delight, as the prophet Nephi tersely expressed it, \"in plainness.\"\n\nFurther examples of the plain and forceful words of Joseph Smith follow:\n\nBaptism of Water and the Spirit\n\nThe gospel requires baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, which is the meaning of the word in the original language - namely, to bury or immerse: We ask the sects, Do you believe this? They answer, No. I believe in being converted. I believe in this tenaciously. So did the Apostle Peter and the disciples of Jesus. But I further believe in the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands.... You might as well baptize a bag of sand as a man, if not done in view of the remission of sins and getting of the Holy Ghost.\n\nBaptism by water is but half a baptism, and is good for nothing without the other half - that is, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. The Savior says, \"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God\" (Joseph Smith's Teachings, pp. 15-16).\n\n704\n\nFaith and Its Fruits\n\nFaith comes by hearing the word of God. If a man has not faith enough to do one thing, he may have faith to do another: if he cannot remove a mountain, he may heal the sick. Where faith is there will be some of the fruits; all gifts and power which were sent from heaven, were poured out on the heads of those who had faith (Ibid., page 38).\n\nConstitution of the United States - Its One Fault\n\nIt is one of the first principles of my life, and one that I have cultivated from my childhood, having been taught it by my father, to allow every one the liberty of conscience. I am the greatest advocate of the Constitution of the United States there is on the earth. In my feelings I am always ready to die for the protection of the weak and oppressed in their just rights.\n\nThe only fault I find with the Constitution is, it is not broad enough to cover the whole ground. Although it provides that all men shall enjoy religious freedom, yet it does not provide the manner by which that freedom can be preserved, nor the punishment of Government officers who refuse to protect the people in their religious rights, or punish those mobs, states, or communities who interfere with the rights of the people on account of their religion (Ibid., page 24). Here, surely, is literature that was lived before it was written. The Prophet had just gone through the persecutions with his people that brought death to many, imprisonment for himself and others, and expulsion from a State, some of whose officers had violated sacred principles of the Constitution. And he had heard from the Chief Executive of our Nation the weakling words, \"Your cause is just; but I can do nothing for you.\" The expression of the Prophet on the Constitution came out of a full heart.\n\nAnother stirring expression, recorded in its burning words for us by Parley P. Pratt, who heard it, was the Prophet's denunciation of the foul mob who held him with other leaders in a dreadful jail. After he had listened to the filthy boastings and profanity of these captors as long as he could stand it, Joseph Smith rose, and in a voice of thunder said, as neatly as apostle Pratt could recall his words: \"Silence, ye fiends of the infernal pit! In the name of Jesus Christ I rebuke you, and command you to be still; I will not live another minute and hear such language. Cease such talk, or you OF J die THIS MINUTE.\" The story continues: He remained quiet till a change of guards (Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt, page 7).\n\nIn another part of his Autobiography, Parley P. Pratt, who knew Joseph Smith intimately during those earlier testing years, writes of the Prophet's language as: \"studied—not smoothed and softened by education and refined by art; but flowing forth in its own native simplicity, and profusely abounding in variety of subject and manner.\" He interested and edified, while, at the same time, he amused and entertained his audience; and none listened to him that were ever weary of his discourse... Even his most bitter enemies were generally overcome, if he could once get their ears (Ibid., page 7).\n\nAll this is borne out by the fact that during his brief life he attracted thousands upon thousands through his spiritual teachings. More than this, his profound lessons of \"No man is capable of judging a matter, in council, unless his own heart is pure\" (Joseph Smith's Teachings, p28-50). A man is saved no faster than he gets 156). There is never a time when the spirit is too old to approach God (Ibid., page 105).\n\n\"There is no such thing as immaterial matter. I fine or pure, and can by purer eyes\" (Ibid., page 104).\n\n\"Daily transgression and daily repentance is not that which is pleasing in the sight of God\" (Ibid., page 136).\n\n\"God judges men according to the use they make of the light which He gives them\" (Ibid., page 161).\n\nExamples of effective expression. Joseph Smith thought boldly, and voiced plainly truth as he had gained it with divine guidance. He had a message of deep import to give to the world—had religious fallacies to correct; and he did it courageously in plain language: \"One thing he did that needed doing and still does, was to take the sectarian fancy off heavenly beings; artists had mis-pictured them; authors had written wrongly of them. Joseph Smith said with characteristic directness: 'An angel of God never has wings.' This point is emphasized because there seems to be need of correcting the fallacy.\"\n\n\"Why,\" said an adolescent Latter-day Saint girl recently, \"I always thought that angels had wings.\" With pictures spread by millions at Christmas, Easter, and on other occasions, portraying the error, it is high time to guard our buying, and help our children to learn the truth. Our Prophet, with words of clarity and concreteness, performed a divine service in bringing heaven closer to us. He truly re-vitalized Christianity; he brought us closer to angels. He knew them as glorious human beings, for Moroni, \"an angel from on high,\" had been his splendid teacher.\n\nWith inspired words and in plainness, Joseph Smith taught the pure and everlasting gospel. With clarity and courage he laid bare the fallacies that had grown round it, stripping away the trappings of sectarianism. Nor was there anything narrow or prejudicial in all this. It was always inspired with a desire to spread truth. \"We do not ask any people,\" he said, \"to throw away any good they have got; we only ask them to come and get more.\" Again he said, \"One of the grand fundamental principles of 'Mormonism' is to receive truth, let it come whence it may.\"\n\nAll of which is in accord with the Thirteenth Article of our Faith— which came from this Prophet of the latter days. Joseph Smith added richly to the religious literature of the world. He contributed not only many sayings of spiritual worth, but also dissertations on lofty themes to clarify principles of the gospel.\n\nFollowing are further illustrations, some excerpts from one of such helpful sermons:\n\n\"GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST\"\n\nVarious and conflicting are the opinions of men in regard to the gift of the Holy Ghost. Some people have been in the habit of calling every supernatural manifestation the effects of the Spirit of God, whilst there are others that think there is no manifestation connected with it at all; and that it is nothing but a mere impulse of the mind, or an inward feeling, impression, or secret testimony or evidence, which men possess, and that there is no such thing as an outward manifestation.\n\nIt is not to be wondered at that men should be ignorant, in a great measure, of the principles of salvation, and more especially of the nature, office, power, influence, gifts, and blessings of the gift of the Holy Ghost; when we consider that the human family have been enveloped in gross darkness and ignorance for many centuries past, without revelation, or any just criterion to arrive at a knowledge of the things of God, which can only be known by the Spirit of God....\n\nWe believe that \"no man can know that Jesus is the Christ, but by the Holy Ghost.\" We believe in it in all its fullness, and power, and greatness, and glory; but whilst we do this, we believe in it rationally, consistently, and scripturally, and not according to the wild vagaries, foolish notions, and traditions of men. The human family are very apt to run to extremes, especially in religious matters, and hence people in general, either want some miraculous display, or they will not believe in the gift of the Holy Ghost at all...\n\nWe believe that the Holy Ghost is imparted by the laying on of hands of those in authority, and that the gift of tongues, and also the gift of prophecy are gifts of the spirit; and are obtained through that medium; but then to say that men always prophesied and spoke in tongues when they had the imposition of hands would be to state that which is untrue, contrary to the practice of the apostles, and at variance with holy writ; for Paul says, \"To one is given the gift of tongues, to another the gift of prophecy, and to another the gift of healing;\" and again: \"Do all prophesy? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?\".... The Church is a compact body composed of different members, and is strictly analogous to the human system.... All members of the natural body are not the eye, the ear, the head, or the hand� yet the eye cannot say to the ear... Nor the head to the foot, I have no need of thee; they are all so many component parts in the perfect machine�the one body; and if one member suffer, the whole of the members suffer with it; and if one member rejoice, all the rest are honored with it. These, then, are all gifts; they come from God; they are of God; they are all the gifts of the Holy Ghost; they are what Christ ascended into heaven to impart; and yet how few of them could be known by the generality of men (Ibid., page 70 ff.). The sermon goes on developing the divine theme clearly, impressively, reasonably. Joseph Smith spoke soundly, inspiringly. One marvels at his spiritual insight, his knowledge and understanding of the scriptures and the common sense he reveals in their interpretation. His words leave a message which is easy, for those prepared in spirit, to accept, and easy to remember. These are marks of true literature. In another inspirational book� Joseph Smith, Prophet Teacher� by B. H. Roberts, we are given a scholarly analysis and eloquent presentation of the masterful contributions to the world of this spiritual leader. It is recommended for careful reading and rereading.\n\nStudies and Activities 1.

Pratt.\n\nSocial Science�Latter-day Saint Political Thought Lesson 3�Political Ideas Advocated by the Prophet Joseph Smith Elder G. Homer Durham For Tuesday, January 25, 1949\n\nProphet Joseph Smith. Evan Jensen as well as being a prophet, Joseph Smith was an American. As such, he underwent the political experiences of the Latter-day Saints and the Americans of his day. But towards these experiences he applied a growing conception and appreciation for political and religious freedom and related problems. From the revealed word he taught the doctrine and ideal of the kingdom of God.\n\nSection 65 of the book of Doctrine and Covenants, dated at Hiram, Ohio, October 1831, identifies the infant Church he established as the kingdom of God on earth. Moreover, \"the keys of the kingdom\"�divine authority� had been re-conferred on men�himself and others.\n\nFew people understand or realize the immediate significance of the Prophet Joseph Smith's inspired declarations, viewed in terms of political theory. The Latter-day Saints were exceedingly practical and proceeded with the business of \"kingdom-building\" on the American frontier, with city planning, economic and social experimentation, and proselyting activities which received local, national, and international attention.\n\nBy January 4, 1833, Joseph had written an American newspaperman, N. E. Seaton, that the secular States of the world were facing destruction, and that in order to escape, \"all people, high and low, rich and poor, male and female,\" should repent and be baptized.\n\nThe snowball growth of the gospel, like Daniel's \"stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands\" (D. & C. 65:2) with its social system and Church government, attracted wide attention and received complex reactions, even persecutions. The Book of Mormon, with its ideal of true Christian society (IV Nephi), aroused antagonism as well as support.\n\nThis situation led to a rich political experience in Joseph Smith's own lifetime, as he endeavored to find the sphere of freedom within the practical political world, wherein the little \"kingdom\" could grow unmolested. Joseph Smith on the United States Constitution\n\nJoseph Smith was ultimately forced by experience to the position where he elaborated and justified the use of force in order to maintain liberty. But more fundamentally, the Prophet's political theory presupposed conditions that would make resort to force unnecessary.\n\nAs early as August 6, 1833, pronouncement was made (D. & C. 98:4-10) that the principle of freedom was God-given and \"belongs to all mankind,\" and that constitutional law should support that principle.\n\nA few months later, December 16, 1833, a revelation was received (section 101:76-80) in which the Constitution of the United States was set forth as the fulfillment of divine purpose \"for the rights and protection of all flesh, according to just and holy principles; that every man may act in doctrine and principle pertaining to futurity.\"\n\nThus was opened the way for reconciling the conflict between kingdom building and the American nation, one of those nations supposedly headed for destruction unless the people received the gospel. In short, in Latter-day Saint belief, American government has a peculiar and special nature under a Constitution which is inspired because it fundamentally recognizes basic \"free agency\" or human liberty, a limitation which God established.\n\nWhen the Prophet offered his dedicatory prayer at the Kirtland Temple, March 27, 1836, mercy was invoked \"upon all the nations of the earth\" and petition made that \"the Constitution of our land... Be established forever\" (D.& C.109:54).\n\nLater, on March 25, 1839, a letter was penned in which the Prophet declared that the Constitution was \"a glorious standard... Founded in the wisdom of God\" because it embraced the principle (federalism combined with civil liberty) which \"guarantees to all parties, sects, and denominations, and classes of religion, equal, coherent, and indefeasible rights\" (D. H. C. III, page 304).\n\nIn other words, the Constitution of the United States sets up a political system within which the kingdom of God, itself mild in nature, subject to self-restraint and toleration, could flourish. The idea is that a good State must necessarily be limited to the extent that it guarantees liberty to and noninterference with religious groups and any other human association based on the liberty of individual conscience, provided that the association, in turn, recognizes the fundamental limitation of free agency, and which is imposed on the American State by its Constitution. As the Article of Faith puts it, as contained in Joseph Smith's letter, March 1, 1842, to John Wentworth: \"We claim Almighty God according to the Articles of Faith.\" A State granting liberty of religion keeps open the avenue to morality in the people; thus may the voice of the people demand that which is \"good.\" And if they do not, the remedy in Latter-day Saint political thought lies in the Church, whose responsibility it is, as Alma said, \"bearing down in pure testimony against them,\" and in love and faith, awakening the individual and social conscience to worthy citizenship.\n\nThe Nature of American Government\nA \"constitutional federal republic\" is perhaps the best descriptive phrase for the American governmental system. \"Constitutional\" means that the Constitution provides the fundamental limits of power while describing and distributing the powers among the government and states. The nation has complete authority over any individual or thing, except in wartime, when total powers have been exercised by the National Government. \"Republic\" means power is exercised and controlled primarily by representatives chosen from among the people. Thus we have our constitutional federal republic, in which public power is distributed, divided, and subdivided, in the interests of the people's liberties under law, but effective action yet made possible.\n\nThe Prophet on Practical Political Problems\nOn February 7, 1844, in support of his announced candidacy for the American presidency, Joseph Smith published a lengthy booklet. Views of the Powers and Policy of the Government of the United States (Joseph Smith: Prophet-Statesman, pp. 144-167; D.H.C. VI, pp. 197-209). A number of interesting views are set forth such as:\n1. The ever present danger that those elected to high office will look to their own selfish interests rather than those of the public.\n2. Military preparedness: \"To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.\"\n3. Peace, notwithstanding preparedness, must be the unswerving objective of foreign policy.\n4. \"Agriculture, manufactures, navigation, commerce, need the fostering care of government,\" including a \"judicious tariff.\"\n5. Reorganization of Congress to make a smaller, more workable body.\n6. Practical politicians will make free use of \"reform\" measures to win fame and power instead of accomplishing real improvements.\n7. The substitution of remedial, corrective measures for traditional methods of penology. \"Let the penitentiaries be turned into seminaries of learning.\"\n8. Abolition of slavery by compensating the owners.\n9. Economy in public affairs.\n10. Banking reforms suggestive of the federal reserve system of today.\n11. Increased responsibility for the President in protecting civil rights.\n12. Peaceful expansion of the American system to embrace Texas (then an independent nation), Mexico, Canada, and \"all the world: let us be brethren, let us be one great family, and let there be universal peace.\" (For the Prophet's platform, see D.H.C. VI, pp. 390-392 or Joseph Smith: Prophet-Statesman, pp. 180-183).\n\nThe Mission and Destiny of America\nSome suggestion of the Prophet's conception of the role of America in world affairs may be gathered from the foregoing discussion. His faithful follower, President John Taylor, put it this way a few years later: \"It is true that the founders of this nation, as a preliminary step for the introduction of more correct principles and that liberty and the rights of man might be recognized, and that all men might become equal before the law of the land, had that great palladium of liberty, the Constitution of the United States, framed. This was the entering wedge for the introduction of a new era, and in it were introduced principles for the birth and organization of a new world.\" (The Gospel Kingdom, page 309).\n\nOn May 12, 1844, speaking of the kingdom of God ideal, the Prophet Joseph Smith stated: \"I calculate to be one of the instruments of setting up the kingdom of Daniel by the word of the Lord, and I intend to lay a foundation that will revolutionize the whole world.\" (Joseph Smith: Prophet Statesman, page 200).\n\nOn April 8, 1844, he had told the general conference at Nauvoo: \"The whole of America is Zion itself from north to south.\" (Ibid., page 198). As President Taylor expressed it on December 17, 1871: \"The worst wish we have for the human family is that the principles enunciated in our Constitution may reverberate over the wide earth, and spread from shore to shore until all mankind shall be free.\" The obvious meaning of these views, propounded by the Prophet in relation to the mission and destiny of America, is that within the framework of constitutional principles, the restored gospel message of Christ the Lord can be spread and God's kingdom be established throughout the world. Tied with America and its Constitution, the \"entering wedge of a new era,\" then, is the destiny of the human race. Whom the gospel message fails to attract will still have the benefit of American influence wherever constitutional freedom spreads and prevails.\n\nThe Constitution of the United States, American government, and the Church and kingdom of God are thus seen as twin, co-ordinate objects in the political thought of Joseph Smith, each with a mission of liberty and service to mankind. Questions for Discussion\n1. What is the Latter-day Saint idea of the kingdom of God? (The following books contain excellent selections on the subject: Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith; Joseph Smith: Prophet Statesman; The Discourses of Brigham Young; The Gospel Kingdom; The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff; Gospel Doctrine.)\n2. Does the principle of freedom belong to all mankind?\n3. What is \"all mankind\"?\n4. What reasons exist to support the belief that the United States Constitution is an inspired document?\n5. What is the fundamental connection between religious freedom and good government? Why is the principle of religious freedom an essential element of a sound political theory?\n\nOptional Lessons in Lieu of Social Science\nThe First Presidencies (Primarily for use outside Continental United States and its possessions)\nLesson 3 - The Presidency of Brigham Young\n\nFor Tuesday, January 25, 1949 Elder T. Edgar Lyon\n\nTHE PRESIDENCY A UNIT THE THREE ARE ONE\nBRIGHAM YOUNG President Brigham Young\n\nThe second President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Brigham Young, was born in Vermont, June 1, 1801. In 1830 he was living in Mendon, New York, where he was following the trade of carpenter, joiner, painter, and glazier, when he first heard of the Book of Mormon. He was converted largely by this book, but did not join the Church until 1832, after which he moved to Kirtland and became intimately associated with the Prophet Joseph Smith.\n\nAt his first meeting with Joseph Smith, the Prophet called upon Brigham to pray, and in his prayer, he spoke in tongues, and the Prophet announced to those present that the gift was from God, and added, \"'the time will come when Brigham Young will preside over this Church\" (Nibley Preston, The Presidents of the Church, page 52). Brigham Young was selected a 712 member of the first quorum of Twelve Apostles of this dispensation, February 14, 1835. He played a prominent part in the Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois periods of the Church. In a revelation given through the Prophet Joseph Smith, January 10, 1841, the Lord says: \"I give unto you my servant Brigham Young to be a president over the Twelve traveling council\" (D. & C. 124:127). Less than six weeks after Joseph Smith was murdered, Brigham Young and the Council of the Twelve Apostles were sustained as the presiding body of the Church. They functioned in this capacity from August 1844 until December 5, 1847, when the First Presidency of the Church was reorganized near Council Bluffs, Iowa. Brigham Young was sustained by the apostles as President of the Church and he chose two counselors, Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards. Then the apostles sustained the First Presidency of the Church. Brigham Young was sustained president with Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards as his counselors. They were sustained by the Church in the log tabernacle at Council Bluffs, December 27, 1847. The new President was to continue in this calling for nearly thirty more years. During this time, because of the loss of his counselors by death, he was assisted by two additional first and two additional second counselors other than those previously mentioned. Brigham Young stood at the head of the Twelve as the governing body at a time when there was need for a leader of great forcefulness. The members of the Church have all heard or have read the testimonies of those who were assembled in the Grove in Nauvoo, after the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum, when the Quorum of the Twelve, with Brigham Young at its head, was sustained as the Presidency of the Church. Typical of these testimonies is that of Emmeline B. Wells (the fifth general president of the Relief Society) who was present when \"the mantle of the Prophet Joseph fell upon Brigham Young and so transfigured him that the people marveled.\" All through the long years of her life, she related this incident in the assemblies of the saints with earnestness and vigor. It was evident that the saints would soon have to leave Illinois. This called for great organizing ability and much wisdom in choosing a new location as well as resourcefulness in providing the means of getting there. The records of the Church during this period indicate that Brigham and his brethren met frequently and studied reports on the Far West. Then, under the inspiration of God, they decided upon their place of settlement. \"We will carry out all the measures of Joseph,\" said Brigham. Many times he expressed the conviction that his experiences with the Prophet during the journey to and from Missouri with Zion's Camp were the most valuable that could have come to him in fitting him for the exodus to the West. In addition to the practical leadership of Brigham Young, he was preeminently a spiritual leader. Under his direction the unfinished temple at Nauvoo was rushed to completion. This was done at great sacrifice in time, money, and labor even when it was apparent that the saints would not long enjoy its use. He was determined that they should have the benefits of their temple endowments and do some ordinance work for the dead, before they embarked on the long trek to the West. When Brigham Young entered the Salt Lake Valley for the second time in the fall of 1848, he had two counselors who were well qualified for the responsible positions they held. Elder Kimball was a man of sound judgment and great courage, and with his other gifts he had an unusual sense of prophetic insight. Willard Richards was a man of penetrating intelligence and added much to the technical organization of the Church and the establishment of the institutions that were needed for their government and in the regulation of their interrelations in their new pioneer life. After entering the Great Basin, Brigham Young commenced to unfold the plan for building the \"kingdom of God\" in a most remarkable fashion which indicated a great vision of the future destiny of the Church. Emphasis was placed upon the necessity of providing the essentials to maintain life—the securing of food, clothing for the cold winters, and shelter from the cold and heat. He urged the people to be economically self-sustaining and to this end he encouraged the emigrating saints and the missionaries who were abroad to bring or send to Zion artisans of trades and occupations which could be adapted to the use of the Latter-day Saints in their mountain homes. Coal mining, iron smelting, cotton raising, silk culture and manufacturing, tanning of hides, manufacturing of paint, shoes, harness, hats, linen, paper, ink, glass and lead products, cabinet and furniture works, soap making, woolen manufacturing, the sugar beet industry, and others were commenced, in addition to the usual farming and livestock activities. 713 MUSIC FOR THE RELIEF SOCIETY CHOIRS WURLITZER ORGANS WURLITZER ORGANS WURLITZER ORGANS FOR BETTER ACCOMPANIMENTS SELDON N.

AT YOUR BOOKSTORE The planting of the many settlements from San Bernardino, California, and Carson Valley in the west, and from Call's Landing in Arizona to Fort Lemhi on the Salmon River in Idaho in the north, were all made as part of his plan to establish latter-day Israel firmly in these mountain valleys, and to enable them to utilize the various natural resources for the temporal salvation of God's people. Along with these activities the spiritual needs of the people were not forgotten. Every settlement was in reality a planned Church unit, under the leadership of the bishopric. No settlement was without its combination Church-schoolhouse, and it became the center of the spiritual life of the people. The great pioneer leader did not think it sufficient to send out a colony and then read reports of its activities, but he endeavored to visit each colony, yearly, if possible. On these pilgrimages he encouraged the colonists with sound, practical advice and fed them the bread of life by preaching to them spiritual messages as he spoke under the inspiration of God. He encouraged them to seek wholesome recreation that would restore their tired bodies and invigorate their minds.\n\nNor was he forgetful of the need of increasing the membership of the Church nor the divine obligation to preach the gospel to the nations of the earth. The missionary work in Europe was expanded to include most of the Continental nations, and more systematic organizations were effected to cover the North American continent and the islands of the Pacific Ocean. Through the organization of the Perpetual Emigrating Fund Company, many thousands of converts were enabled to emigrate to Zion through this cooperative enterprise who otherwise would never have been able individually to meet the costs of the journey.\n\nPrior to his joining the Church, Brigham Young was an obscure laborer engaged in farming, the building trades, and functioning as an unpaid Methodist class leader. It was through the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, his contacts with the Prophet Joseph Smith, and the power of the Priesthood that he was enabled to lead the Church as he did. He declared: I do not wish men to understand I had anything to do with our being here. That was the providence of the Almighty. It was the power of God that wrought out Salvation for His people. I never could have devised such a scheme.\n\nWhen he passed from mortality on August 29, 1877, at Salt Lake City, the life of a great prophet-leader closed amidst the scenes of the great achievements his leadership had accomplished in the barren wastes of western America. B. H. Roberts said of him: These achievements write down Brigham Young as the Greatest Pioneer and Colonizer of modern times—an Empire founder; and place him easily among the first score of Great Americans."

    "content": "Joy in Full Measure\n\nPresident Belle S. Spafford (Address delivered at the morning session of the Annual General Relief Society Conference, September 30, 1948)\n\nTHIS is indeed a glorious and history-making day in the life of Relief Society. It is a day that has been anxiously anticipated and one that will be long remembered—a day of rejoicing and thanksgiving.\n\nToday we remember the thousands of our sisters throughout the world whom circumstances prevent being with us on this important occasion, but whose hearts and prayers are with us—sisters in faraway Finland, Lebanon, Syria, the isles of the sea, South Africa, Old Mexico, and elsewhere—women whose devotion to Relief Society and whose contributions to this fund-raising program have helped to make this occasion possible.\n\nMy heart reaches out in love and gratitude to Relief Society women the world over for their wonderful response to this great fund-raising program. Relief Society women today are heirs of a great heritage. They have proved themselves worthy of that heritage, demonstrating in their characters the same sterling qualities possessed by the women who have gone before them—faith, devotion to duty, willingness to unselfishly labor and sacrifice that this society might go forward. They have upheld a wonderful tradition and justified the confidence placed in them by the First Presidency, who, when authorizing us to launch the fund-raising program, said: \"We have never known the sisters to fail in anything they have undertaken in the past and we feel sure they will not fail in this.\"\n\nI am confident that those who have gone before us are today rejoicing with us, for this building program is not ours alone; it belongs to the past and it will belong to the future. In this magnificent achievement the women of this day have kept faith with the noble women of the past by opening the way whereby their dream may be brought to fruition. They have nobly and generously fulfilled the great special assignment given to the women of this day, making possible a lasting memorial to the women of this Church. They have set a worthy pattern of loyalty and obedience for Relief Society women of the future, and those who follow after them will remember their efforts and bless them for what they have done.\n\nWe stand humbled at the magnitude of what has been accomplished. One year ago when the fund-raising program was launched we recognized it to be an enormous undertaking. Its greatness has in no measure diminished as the year has passed. In fact, as we view it today it assumes even greater proportions than we judged it for a year ago.\n\nThe Lord has blessed our efforts, however, unto a full measure of success and we acknowledge his goodness unto us. His spirit has rested upon Relief Society women in all parts of the world, touching their hearts and causing them to want to do their part of this program. Relief Society officers have evidenced superb leadership, secretaries have faithfully and accurately kept record of contributions. Visiting teachers have loyally carried the program into the homes. Relief Society members with generous hearts have given to it their full support. Our appreciation for all that the sisters have done is unbounded. We acknowledge the support and co-operation of the Priesthood authorities: the First Presidency, members of the Council of the Twelve, the Presiding Bishopric—and other General Authorities, the brethren of the General Church Welfare Committee, as well as stake and ward, mission and branch Priesthood authorities. All have rallied to our cause and strengthened our hands.\n\nOnly those who have been closely identified with the work incident to the planning and conduct of the program as it has been carried forward in the general office can fully appreciate the great responsibility carried by Sister Marianne Sharp as chairman. The wisdom and judgment required, the ability to anticipate and satisfactorily deal with questions and problems related to the program, the capacity to keep track of numberless details, and the tireless efforts necessary in taking care of limitless and incessant correspondence are beyond description. Yet Sister Sharp has fulfilled all of these requirements with efficiency and with the true spirit of service, in no way being stampeded by the pressures. Sister Sharp has been assisted by a committee of general board members composed of the following sisters: Velma N. Simonsen, Edith S. Elliott, Evon W. Peterson, Mary J. Wilson, and Leone G. Layton. These sisters have been loyal, meeting every requirement made of them throughout the past year.\n\nTHE program has been conducted in a dignified manner in keeping with the high standards of the society. Ideals have determined its purposes, and ideals have directed our practices. Sentiment has entered into it, giving depth of feeling and warmth of heart to the program. This achievement represents great monetary value, but not monetary value alone. Herein are represented many intangible values—values of supreme worth—appreciation for the honored position accorded women in the gospel plan; testimony of the divinity of the work of the society; and gratitude for the opportunity given the sisters of the Church to serve through their own great Relief Society; loyalty to leadership; unselfish devotion to a great cause. It is a reflection of the greatness that is inherent within the society.\n\nThe achievement represents deep-seated and tender emotions—the love of a daughter for her mother or grandmother; the love of a mother for her daughter; respect and devotion for a friend; the desire to memorialize a loved one whose memory is revered; the wish to reach out and include as a part of this wonderful sisterhood a dear one who may not have availed herself of this blessing.\n\nThe dollars which make up the fund represent individual contributions of many types: the providently saved nickels and dimes of sisters to whom these savings meant much; the Christmas gift of one sister, long anticipated in order that some little personal need might be met; the golden wedding gift of another, cherished because a loved one had given it to her; the gift of an aged sister, who, in passing away a few days after making her contribution, rejoiced that she had lived long enough to see this program launched and to participate in it; the young sister not yet old enough to be a Relief Society member, but looking forward to the time when this privilege would be hers. These dollars represent money earned by individual sisters through the labor of their hands—the aprons made, cakes baked and sold; they represent evenings spent in caring for a baby, or days spent in domestic service.\nThese dollars represent group earnings—earnings which challenged the resourcefulness and ingenuity of the sisters and made heavy demands upon their time and energies—earnings which required hours of hard work. Irrespective of how they were acquired, however, all are an expression of love and appreciation for Relief Society and a willingness to do that which is required for the good of the society.\nJust as all of our righteous efforts return to bless us and make us glad, so will the efforts of Relief Society women in meeting this great present-day assignment return to bless them and bring to them joy in full measure. They may experience the satisfaction that comes from a task well done. They may feel assured of the approbation of our Heavenly Father. They may enjoy that deep sense of happiness and contentment that comes from doing one's part in a great and worthy cause. They may be comforted in the knowledge that they have glorified the day in which they have lived and served our beloved society.\nMy earnest prayer is that the blessings of the Lord will continue with you. May He abundantly bless all those entrusted with responsibility in this program from this time forth. May vision, wisdom, and judgment accompany every step in the planning of the building. May intelligence, honesty, and skill be the constant guides of those who shall labor in its erection. May those who shall administer this sacred fund make sure that each dollar expended is spent wisely and well; may they never lose sight of the manner in which these dollars were accumulated nor the lofty motives that prompted their giving.\nMay all future efforts be accompanied by the same measure of success and the same degree of joy and satisfaction which we feel today. And, in the words of Sister Blomquist of the Swedish Mission, \"when the building is finished may joy and happiness, knowledge and truth, love and charity flow from within its walls to the whole world.\"\nBRAVE HEARTS\nEvelyn Fjeldsted\n\nThe hopefulness and cheerfulness of brave hearts everywhere—resolved to carry on against great odds—result, at length, in problems solved."

    "content": "And what of the Promise? Counselor Marianne C. Sharp (Address delivered at the morning session of the Annual General Relief Society Conference, September 30, 1948)\n\nSister Spafford has asked me, as chairman of the Relief Society Building Fund Committee, to give a report on the Building Fund. You sisters who are here today, representing the more than 111,000 Relief Society members throughout the world, have come rejoicing to commemorate the conclusion of the fund-raising program to erect a Relief Society Building. Just a year ago lacking two days, the Relief Society sisters assembled at the 1947 annual general Relief Society conference voted to raise a vast sum of money for the purpose of erecting a Relief Society building. You will recall that the plan provided that all Relief Society stake boards donate one half of their stake board funds on hand as of December 1946, and that every stake, in addition, be responsible for $5 for every enrolled member as of December 1946. Provision was also made to have Relief Society members and friends donate Special and Memorial Gifts, as they might desire, and the missions of the Church, except the European missions, were invited to take part in the financing program according to quotas to be set by their respective Relief Society mission presidents in consultation with the mission presidents. It was hoped that these amounts, when added together, would make up a grand total of $500,000 or half a million.\nTo raise such a vast sum of money in one year was an undertaking which to some seemed well-nigh impossible and to others not even advisable. But the program had the full approval of the First Presidency, and right after the October conference the funds began slowly to come in. To reach the true objective it was not only necessary that the money be raised, but it was essential that the giving be done in a spirit of love so that blessings might be poured out upon the sisters. From the expressions which have accompanied the remittances, it seems certain that the sisters throughout the world have earned the blessings of the Lord and that they have been bound together in closer bonds of sisterhood.\nAs one sister wrote who lived far away from any organized Relief Society: \"In my heart the quota would never be complete if my share was missing.\"\nThere have been numberless Memorial Gifts made to honor dear, faithful Relief Society workers of both the past and present. Recently the Florida Stake Relief Society expressed the spirit of the Memorial Gifts when they wrote:\nThis money is to be applied as a Memorial offering to honor our beloved leaders, Brother and Sister Charles A. Callis. It is a pleasure for us to do this as we feel that our roll could never be complete without its being headed by the names of two of our leaders who have given of themselves so unselfishly to the building up of the Father's kingdom in Page 727 the South.\nWe know that the lives of these two people stand as a living memorial and will always be indelible on the minds of the people of the South. Truly the spirit of this undertaking has been pleasing to our Father in heaven.\n\nWe report to you now the expenses which have been incurred to date incident to raising the money. All figures used throughout will be in even dollars.\nPostage $156\nStationery 27\nPrinting 758\nFinancial Clerk 75\nInscription on Certificates 234\nForeign Exchange 148\nTotal $2,058\n\nBefore the beginning of the fundraising, it was the earnest desire of the general board that it might provide some revenue to meet such necessary expenses. A few years ago one of the General Authorities wrote a series of articles for TheLater the general board desired to issue the articles in book form as a reference. He consented but requested that the royalties go to Relief Society. The earnings were earmarked to meet any necessary expenses incidental to raising the Building Fund.\n\nWhen the entire edition is sold, the royalties will be sufficient to meet all the expenses just reported. We know you likewise are happy that each dollar you contribute will go into the building. WE feel very humble and at the same time very proud to report now the amount of money which you and thousands of sisters whom you represent have raised to erect a Relief Society Building. \n\nWe know that long hours and arduous toil have been necessary to accomplish the achievement you have made. The stake board quota of $35,483 has been paid in full, and it is with deep gratitude that we report that every stake in the Church has been recognized here today. Contribution quotas \"of stakes amounting to $443,885 have been paid, and in addition Special and Memorial Gifts amounting to $10,028 making a grand total from the stakes of the Church of $449,396. \n\nEre and Memorial Gifts made directly to the general board have ranged from gifts of $1 to one gift of $10,000, and from these gifts has come an additional sum of $12,482. Our hearts have been continually touched by the spirit of the sisters in the missions. From those who have no places of their own in which to meet, no chairs even on which to sit, no tables at which to work, has come an outpouring of offerings which made us who have plenty feel humble indeed.\n\nWe are proud to report that the money contributed by the sisters of $43,927 has been advised by the Presiding Bishopric that the amount of money �$8,000�which Relief Society sisters years ago donated to erect a woman's building, is being turned to Relief Society. For this we are indeed grateful, for now the money raised by those dear sisters of long ago will really become stone and mortar in the building for which they worked and dreamed.\n\nAND WHAT OF THE PROMISE?\n\nOur hearts rejoice to give now the grand total of money given to the Relief Society Building Fund, an amount of $554,516. \n\nWITH deepest gratitude and thanksgiving we report that the First Presidency have informed us that they will give to us a site on which to erect the building, and that the choosing of the proper site is under consideration at the present time. They have assured us that they want us to have the right neighbors and ample space for our beautiful building. They have instructed Sister Spafford to go ahead at once to perfect our building plans, as they feel that the Relief Society Building is urgently needed. As soon as the First Presidency designate the site you may be sure the general board will at once inform you, and it is our earnest expectation that before too long you will be able to enter the building which you will have made possible.\n\nThe generosity of the General Authorities to the women of the Church I am sure brings joy to your hearts as it does to the hearts of the general board members. \n\nIn contemplating the work of Relief Society we always praise and emulate the work of the sisters of the past. In viewing this stupendous accomplishment of Relief Society today, I feel certain that the sisters of the future have been given just cause to admire and emulate your example.\n\nI feel that once again, as over the years, the sisters have demonstrated their love and their faithfulness and are worthy to have been given by divine revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith that greatest blessing the Relief Society�through which the sisters of the Church render service to the Church and make individual progress on the eternal path to the celestial kingdom.\n\nOne year ago President Spafford said to us, \"We must not fail.\" With thanksgiving we say to her at this time, we have not failed, but have succeeded gloriously beyond our greatest expectations. You have been the instruments by which that great dream of the women of the past will become reality. Through your unselfish giving the dream of the past has become the sure promise of the morrow. For your vision and faithfulness I pray that the blessings of our Heavenly Father may continue to be poured out upon you and on all other Relief Society sisters found over the world this day.\n\nTHE BUILDING FUND\n\nNellie W. Neal\nI can't think all the building will be in wood and stone,\nWhen we erect the edifice we've come to call our own,\nBecause, as I've been giving to help attain our goal,\nI've felt a growth within myself, expanding heart and soul."

Stewart snowy plains of Wyoming. John Fenton leaned against the window, staring unseeingly at the endless wastes. How could a returning missionary not look like a returning missionary? He fished in his pocket for Susan's letter. He held it in his hands but did not read it. He knew it off by heart.\n\nThe train fled through the Darling, I've planned this Thanksgiving. It has to be. I've asked all my friends from school and some of yours, don't come home all stirred up about things. I just want to love you and some of them just don't understand. John grinned at Clara Wells, who sat opposite him. She was returning from her mission in the Eastern States.\n\n\"How do returning missionaries look, Sister Wells?\" he demanded.\n\nClara Wells looked at the letter in his hand. \"So that's what she said. Well... How do I look?\"\n\n\"Nice,\" John said thoughtfully, \"and sort of shining.\"\n\n\"Do I?\" She nodded her smooth brown head. \"Well, I've had enough experiences in the last two years to keep me shining for a lifetime.\" She looked at him critically. \"You look very nice, too, tall and dark, and purposeful... And something else, indefinable. Don't let the world rob you of it.\"\n\nThe porter came through calling, \"Rock Springs... Rock Springs, five minutes 'Home?' Clara's voice wavered.\n\nOn her coat. Have to look after Maury McClaughlin from now on.\" \"Maury McClaughlin!\" John demanded. \"That wild Scot?\" Clara laughed. \"I know she's been a handful. But it's that impulsive Curiosity of hers. She couldn't help getting lost in Chicago. After all the things you were up against in the British Mission, you ought to be able to handle a seventeen-year-old youngster,\" \"But she's not just any youngster,\" John stated flatly. \"I can't do it.\"\n\n\"You have to do it,\" Clara pointed out reasonably. \"You're the only missionary left. It's just a few hours to Salt Lake. Her aunt will be at the station.\" The door was flung open at the back of the car.\n\n\"Sister Wells,\" a clear voice shrieked. \"Your station it is,\" John pulled his neck into his collar as the quick footsteps rushed down the aisle, Maury McClaughlin brushed past him and flung herself into Clara's arms. \"Oh, it's lost I will be with you gone! Not to see your bonny face or hear your voice!\" Maury's own voice rose despairingly.\n\nJohn Fenton's mouth twitched as he watched the girl burrow her face into Clara's shoulder. Maury's bright red hair shimmered like silk. She was a tall girl and very slender. She lifted her face.\n\nHer eyes were a deep, gemlike blue. She owned the freckled skin of the red-haired. Her gestures were dramatic and sincere and terribly young. \"You've been an angel to me, that you have!\" Maury possessed a radiance that made John feel he was in the path of a prairie fire.\n\nClara kissed Maury. \"You have a big job ahead of you, dear, making a home and a place for your mother and father and your small sisters. But you can do it. You'll have them with you in no time at all. I only wish I could be close enough to help.\"\n\n\"But you've been so good to me!\" Maury wailed. \"And I've been a grief to you. That I have.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.\" Clara reached for her bags. \"Now you stay close to Elder Fenton and don't leave his side at any station.\" \"Aye, that I won't,\" vowed Maury passionately. She turned to John. \"I promise with my hand on my heart not to give you a moment's worry.\"\n\nJohn bit back the chuckle. He knotted his brows firmly. \"You'll not be getting off at any station. Own sister to understand?\" She asked reluctantly, \"Not even if I see an Indian?\"\n\n\"No,\" said John, \"and please don't scream when you see another cowboy. It's...\n\nIt's embarrassing.\" They stood on the train platform and watched Clara step into the circle of joyous friends and relatives, who hugged her furiously one after another, their faces wet with tears. Clara waved her hand at John and Maury as the train pulled away. He put his arms around an elderly, gray-haired woman, who made him think of his own mother. The train gathered speed. John felt a wild tug of homesickness. He wanted to get off and push the cars. They seemed to move with such deliberate pace. Maury pulled at his sleeve. \"We'd better go.\" \"Of whom do you think when you look like that?\" \"Someone very nice?\" \"The nicest,\" John agreed. \"I'm just hoping she won't have changed her mind about me. I was mighty lucky to get her.\" For an instant, the light seemed to vanish from Maury's face, but she slid into the seat beside him and folded her hands demurely on her lap. \"Susan Meredith, isn't it? Sister Wells told me you are engaged to marry her,\" John Fenton stared ahead. He saw Susan's small, delicate face, her dark curling hair, her competent, assured manner. Susan knew exactly what she wanted from life. He still found it hard to believe that she had included him in her plans, that she was willing to marry him when she could have so many others. \"There was a small rustling beside him. John turned. Maury was sitting quietly, her hands in her lap, her eyes on his face. \"Is it so large then, the city?\" she asked. \"You recall MacBrogan town. I shall be quite lost in a large place,\" 740 John grinned ruefully, recalling the Chicago episode. \"I think I should warn the city fathers that you're coming.\" He sobered. \"But I do remember MacBrogan town, the good times we had there. I remember the first night we came, two missionaries cold, hungry, and tired, and how your father took us in and fed us and listened to us.\" Maury's eyes grew large and brilliant. \"Always it was so. The best for the poor who had no roof or cover. That was my father all his life long.\" \"He's a wonderful man,\" John patted her hand. \"It won't be long. You'll get a fine job and work and save, and your family will be saving too, and then you'll be together, perhaps next Thanksgiving.\" She smoothed the darned place in her plaid skirt. \"Tell me then about this Thanksgiving. I don't understand.\" John chuckled. \"It's a wonderful day. Everybody gets a turkey or goose and calls in all the relatives and friends. Why, in St. George the women start getting ready two weeks ahead.\" He took a deep breath. \"Gosh! I can almost smell the dinner now, mince and apple pies, turkey browning.\" Maury sighed in wonder and delight. She slid down in the seat. \"So many days for just fun here in America. I love it. In the war we were so often hungry, never until on the Queen Mary was I full—here.\" She pressed thin hands over her stomach. John Fenton felt a quick pity, remembering the pinched faces of the people he had left behind, their austere tables, their uncomplaining relief society. But he gunned down on her, remembering. \"I'll never forget the look on the waiter's face when he saw you stow away your third breakfast on that ship. I think you set a record.\" He laughed at her quick blush. \"Never mind, your aunt will no doubt have a marvelous meal waiting, then you'll find out about Thanksgiving.\" But her white hands pressed in as though the pain persisted still. \"Where will you be, Elder Fenton?\" \"With Susan. She promised me a fabulous dinner. Then my brother is driving up to take me down to St. George, and I'll have another celebration,\" \"Will Susan go with you?\" He shook his head. \"She goes to the University. There are so many things going on at Thanksgiving parties... She may come later,\" \"She must be very beautiful?\" \"She is!\" She smoothed her cheek. \"Would—would anyone find me... fair?\" John regarded her critically, \"There are a lot of men who really like red hair. Oh, you'll get married all right to a fine young man, no doubt.\" Her small face tightened. Her lower lip quivered. \"That I'll not!\" she said tartly and rose. She tossed her flaming hair, \"I shall stay unmarried forever and ever, aye, that I will.\" Now what was wrong with her? John turned to watch her swinging, determined stride down the aisle. Suddenly, in spite of her height, she seemed very small and alone, an alien in a strange land. The porter came. \"A telegram for Miss McClaughlin, Sir.\" SEASONING\n741\n'I'll take it,\" John went in search of her. He found her two cars down, the center of an admiring group who pleaded for more details of her beloved Scotland. \"A telegram?\" She rose to her feet and followed him back to their car. \"Now who would be spending of their good money?\" John coughed to hide his laughter. \"Open it and see.\" She obeyed him. Her eyes flashed across the lines. \"Ah, 'tis not as bad as I feared.\" John took the extended telegram. It was from her aunt. Sorry. Will not be at station. Neil sick in San Francisco. Key in mail box. Love, Aunt Nora. \"I'm sorry,\" John handed the telegram back. Compassion shook him, remembering her parting from her loved ones, the lonely journey. She should be welcomed with banners and drums. Suddenly, he turned. Of course! She could come along to Susan's dinner. It would take the edge off the loneliness. He started to tell her. No. He would ask Susan to ask her. That would make the invitation warmer, more welcoming. The hours inched away. John's impatience mounted with every mile. Maury sat beside him, pale and still with excitement. The early dusk had settled and the lights had been turned on. In their glow her hair gleamed like bright gold. John thought of the moors she had left behind, the little cottage that housed her warm, friendly family. He found himself saying a prayer for her, silently, that she would find joy in the city for which she had sacrificed so much. At last, after incredible waiting, the porter came through, calling, \"Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City . . .\" John drank in the name. His heart seemed to crowd in his throat, making it difficult to breathe. Maury jumped to her feet. \"Did you hear, Elder Fenton! Salt Lake City, the man said. It's here! It's really here!\" She reached for her shabby green coat. \"Oh, if only I had someone of my own. Someone to share this moment. It is the greatest of my life. I know it.\" John handed her hat to her. She surveyed it ruefully. \"I'm afraid I don't look very grand.\" John looked down at her flushed, shining face, her brilliant eyes. His heart climbed back in his throat. He grinned. \"With that hair you couldn't look any way but grand. Queen's color.\n\nThat's what my mother calls it. We're stopping! He went before her down the aisle, but so many people were ahead of him that he was stalled to one impatient step at a time. He looked through the windows. Suddenly he saw Susan, standing in the center of a group of friends. Her thin face was rosy with cold and excitement. She looked very smart in her beaver coat with the brown hat to match. Her dark hair had been cut short. It curled around her face. John recognized one or two of the group around her, girls he had known from the University. Gladness welled up in him until he could hardly bear the weight of it. Maury stumbled against him. \"Just wait until you meet them,\" he told her. \"You'll feel as much at home as if you sat on a moor.\" At last the crowd thinned. I stepped down. Susan ran to him, hands outstretched. \"John, darling! How handsome you look.\" She flung back her head for his kiss. \"Come and meet everyone. Mother put dinner at nine so you'll have plenty of time to make an impression.\" John laughed at her flow of words. \"Susan, you haven't changed either. Bossing me around just like always.\" He kissed her again and put his arm around her while she made the introductions. He shook hands with them all. His eyes searched theirs. It was a habit he had acquired in the mission field. In all of them he found the blank, uncomprehending stare of the stranger. \"What a lovely place!\" Even the smoke-grimed platform and the black, ugly gates had the beauty of familiarity. Susan laughed. \"Now you do sound just like a missionary. Oh, John, it's been hideous with you gone. I want to catch up on all the fun we've missed.\" She stopped short. \"John? That girl? She keeps looking at you?\" Contrition seized him. Maury. He had forgotten her. He turned. Maury was standing some distance away, a slim, waiting figure, something patient and forlorn about her. John took Susan's arm. \"Come and meet her. She's a convert from Scotland. Darling, would you do me a favor and ask her to your dinner?\" He stumbled over words in his haste to tell of the aunt who could not come, of Maury's family in Scotland. Susan drew back, impatience on her pretty face. \"John! I couldn't possibly ask her! Mother has stretched the table to its last inch. It would ruin the decorations.\" \"But Susan, we just have to ask her. This is her first night in this place. She hasn't a soul. It's Thanksgiving. Please, Susan, for me?\" Susan shook her head. \"John, you'll never learn. Things just aren't done that way. I'll ask her some other time. We'll put her in a cab. You'll see, she will be perfectly all right.\" Maury looked up and saw them coming toward her. John winced away from the blinding relief in her smile. He turned to Susan. \"I can't just put her in a cab. That's what we did in Chicago. That's why we missed our train. Ten missionaries spent a day looking for her.\" \"Where on earth was she?\" \"The cab driver's wife was having a baby, no one to help her take care of the children. Maury thought it would just take an hour or so to help out, and stayed eighteen hours.\" \"Good heavens!\" Susan's lip curled. \"Where do you find your friends?\" John said stubbornly, \"I don't have time to argue now. You take your friends and go on back to the house. I'll see that Maury gets to her aunt's house in one piece.\" He introduced the two girls. He felt an instant's wonder. It must be Maury's bright hair, but something about her made Susan seem small and drab and meager. \"I'm going to take you home,\" he explained to Maury. She looked from him to Susan. \"Oh, but the dinner, Elder Fenton. I couldna' take you away.\" Susan smiled widely. \"It's all tight, Miss McClaughlin. He can come later, Goodbye now, John.\" \"Well... If you're verry sure...\" Maury's Scotch burr was never more in evidence. John reached for her bags. Watched the others leave, now let's find a cab.\" A cab whisked away just as they reached the street. They hesitated. Maury looked about her. She took a deep breath, \"Is the city then so near?\" \"Just a few minutes walk,\" John assured her, \"Would you...,\" she swallowed, \"would you spare the time? I could come for my bags tomorrow, have such a hunger, here.\" She pressed her hands over her breast, \"I have a hunger to see it all... The Temple... The Eagle Gate.\" The passionate longing in her voice made a lump rise in John's throat. \"Of course we will. Wait here a moment.\" The Temple grounds were closed. They peered through the gates. The floodlights made a shower of gold on the stay stones. Moroni stood in golden relief against the dark blue of the night sky. Maury's face, he whispered, \"It's better than I dreamed,\" John said huskily, \"It's better than I remembered.\" They walked to the Eagle Gate and back, to stop and stare like any pair of tourists at the Lion House 743 the statue of Brigham Young, the dazzling beauty of Main Street after dark. John found that he had been walking for a long time. \"Gosh, girl! You're hungry!\" \"That I am!\" The cafe was small, cheerful, and bright. John studied the menu. \"Turkey, of course?\" \"Turkey?\" she lifted inquiring brows, \"Every true American has to have a slice of turkey inside him. On Thanksgiving day,\" She sighed and slipped out of her shabby green coat. \"Oh, this wonderful America. I think this day was made for me. A Thanksgiving day and my own heart so full it can hardly lift her eyes to his. Just think what I have to be thankful for this day... The missionaries coming... My father urging us all to listen. Something new and strange and beautiful coming into our lives... and now, look at me here!\" She sat up taller. \"A Latter-day Saint in the Promised Land.\" John looked at her for a long moment and pieces of a puzzle fell into place. There was something in her sick and sure and unashamed that made his own heart home shine before him in all their hard work and struggle and triumph. Don't let the world Tob you, Sister Wells had said.

They are literally the forefathers of many Latter-day Saint men and women, as was remarked by a noted genealogist visiting in Salt Lake City some years ago.

She easily won four first places in the games: the eighty-meter women's hurdles, in which she established a new world record of eleven and two-tenths seconds; the 100-meter and 200-meter women's sprints; and the anchor in the 400-meter women's relay. She already holds the world record for the women's broad jump, for which she could not compete this time as it was held at the same time as one of the events in which she was contending. Had she won this in the Games, she would have been the only known athlete since the dawn of the Olympic Games to win five first places.\n\nOur American, Babe Didrikson, won enormous prestige for taking two first places and one second in the 1936 Olympics.\n\nWILHELMINA, now self-titled dowager princess of the Netherlands, abdicated the throne of the Netherlands and the Dutch Empire September 4, in favor of her daughter Juliana. It was Wilhelmina's sixty-eighth birthday and the fiftieth anniversary of her coronation. Her reign has been marked by thrift, simplicity, a close relationship with her people, which was a distinct royal innovation, a shrewd insight into affairs of state, and the courage to follow the path she believed right, and in some cases humane, in the face of general opposition. She is the sole survivor of seventeen monarchs contemporary with her first days as queen. Five only wore their crowns until their deaths.\n\nWilhelmina's hobbies have been bicycling, skating, horseback riding, walking in the woods, and painting. Two days after her mother's abdication, Juliana became queen of the Netherlands at an investiture service at Niewe Kerk, the church being now connected with the royal palace.

Crisp\nstalks of celery will gleam among\ndark-skinned olives; savory dressing\nwill be spooned out of the golden\nturkey; mounds of mashed potatoes\nhidden under a yellow coating of\nbutter will vie with tender green\npeas and bright red pickled beets to\nmake a kaleidoscope of colors against\nthe heavy linen damask highlighted\nwith crystal and silver. Each member\nof the family will reverently bow\nhis head and with grateful heart return\nthanks to his Father in heaven\nfor the multiplicity of material blessings\nhe enjoys.

And at\nthe contrast again there may arise\nin the breast of the present-day\nsaint an upwelling of gratitude for\nconveniences and luxuries enjoyed\nby him.\n\nToo often in considering the lot\nof the saints in earlier days, emphasis\nis placed upon the poverty\nin which they lived to the exclusion\nof the richness of spirit which they\npossessed, so abundantly. This spiritual\nwealth transmuted their everyday\nliving into graciousness and\nsplendor. There sang in their\nhearts the knowledge that their daily\nrighteous acts were taking them\nalong the path to an eternal life\nwhich would be beautiful and satisfying\nbeyond their most cherished\ndreams and hopes.

By tending and nurturing them they will glow with a brighter hue and give light to the souls of the faithful by which, in spite of the cares and sorrows of the world, they will ultimately reach that flaming celestial world, there to dwell eternally in the presence of the Lord.\nFor these riches, true thanksgiving should be offered. M. C. S.\n\nQuesting Lights\nBelle Watson Anderson\n\nChapter 8\nSynopsis: Andrew Rumgay leaves his mother and his fiancée Jane Allison in Scotland and joins his friend Hugh Shand to emigrate to America. They meet Mother MacKinlay and her son Bob, whom they had known while doing missionary work, and become acquainted with Kathleen Coleman and her friend Margaret Purvis. Hugh and Kathleen are married on board the ship. While crossing the plains Andrew is lost in a blizzard and is rescued by Margaret. She later leaves the Macs and goes to live in Tooele.\nAndrew and the Macs arrive in Zion and Kathleen and Hugh have a son—Mac Coleman Shand. Andrew farms and saves money to bring Jane from Scotland. When he finally sends it, he receives news that Jane has married someone else. Andrew is a grieved and lonely man and he sends for the two youngest children in his family. He is called on a mission, and Margaret comes to stay with the children while he is gone.\n\nANDREW became a hero overnight.\nThe news spread to every part of King's Kettle that Andrew Rumgay, the Mormon boy, who went to America a few years ago, had returned.\nFriends and relatives from near and far began calling to see him, asking many questions. \"What about the gold lying in the streets of America? What about all the free land? Does every man own his home? Are you rich, Andrew? Show us some of your wealth.\"\nAndrew decided this was an opportunity to preach the gospel, so he answered every question carefully and truthfully.\nThe one thing in which they were all interested was the land. They would sit for hours and nod and listen to the young man discuss the soil—mother earth. It was the desire of every one of them to own a piece of ground.\nHe told them about the real wealth of America, the rich spiritual values—the purpose for which the land had been held for so many centuries for the restoration of the gospel.\nHe had seen Mormonism in action and it was wonderful.\n\"Yes, but we have a religion,\" they countered.\nThey had a church which most of them attended every Sunday. Father Douglas was a guid man. He baptized the children, preached a guid sermon, came whenever he was needed. Yes, they had a religion, but no land.\nThere were different places to which the restless sons of Scotland were emigrating—Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, but the choice of them all was America. For a few times on Sunday the branch church was filled to overflowing with people, in hopes the young elder from Utah would speak about America.\n\nAndrew's mother's home of two rooms, which had furnished a roof over the heads of his loved ones since the happy day David Rumgay had carried Janet Black over its worn threshold, was still a model of efficiency. Everything was planned, budgeted, and carried out to the last detail. It had always taken careful organization to care for ten children without the father.\nPage 747\n748 The thing that seemed uncanny to Andrew now was the suit problem his mother handled so skillfully. She had five boys to keep decently dressed at their work every day, and at church on Sunday. She kept a record of who got the suit last year, whose turn it was this year, material on hand, what relative had given them a worn suit, what she got out of it after washing and cutting it down. She had made every suit Andrew had worn, until the new suit he had bought for going away.\nLife for the children was different in Scotland than in America. The bairns were all up at daylight, eating their porridge before their eyes were half open and, with their dinner pails in their hands, off to work before sunup. Often the Sabbath was the only day they saw the sun. The missionary thought of the children in Utah, well-fed and warmly clothed, with plenty of the necessities of life, if their parents were willing to work for them. They had time for rest and play, and the opportunity of attending school every day. How thankful he was that Bill and Janet were in Zion, and with such a wonderful person to take care of them!\nE remembered that Margaret was very much like his mother around the house, quick and efficient in getting things done. He had worked, cooked, and cleaned for the bairns, and what a slow, hard job it had been. Then Margaret had come into his home, and he found there was magic in her touch. The place, so out of harmony at times, began to respond immediately to her woman's contact.\nHe smiled when he remembered the curtains he had hung in such pitiful folds and plaits. The first night he had come home after Margaret had arrived the curtains fairly laughed and shouted, \"Man, look at us now!\" The dishes on the shelves kept their faces clean and shining in spite of the fact that they were still used three times a day. What a time he had had to keep them clean and he had been always breaking dishes.\nMargaret was beautiful and so the cabin was beautiful, he recalled. Margaret smiled, and was cheerful, so the cabin was smiling and cheerful. He always thought of her in a long, full, billowy dress of blue, with flowers in her black, silken hair.\nAndrew stayed close to his mother during his time out for visiting. All his friends and relatives had been to see him, and time was precious. Soon he would be leaving for his missionary work. So, while she cooked, darned, and mended, he read to his mother from the Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants. He wanted to study the gospel, so this was an opportunity for them to study together.\nJanet Rumgay's joy was full and brimming over, as she sat and listened to her son. He was such a guid lad. Out of her tears, trials, heartaches, and prayers, he had somehow come through. He was growing to look like his father. David was about again now that Andrew had come back home. But David could not talk and read like Andrew. Mormonism had been like a college education for her son. She must keep all his brothers and sisters in the Church.\nShe often asked him about the young lady with the pretty name who was caring for the bairns.\n\nHe seemed to trust her; he never worried about the children. But then Mother Mac and Kathleen were near, if they should get sick. Andrew would become excited and very enthusiastic. \"Why, Margaret is the best little nurse in America.\" His mother suggested that perhaps, only perhaps, if Margaret was willing to take care of the bairns, she might be willing to take care of him, too, when he returned. She watched his face light up and she studied him very intently, pleased with what she saw. Then Andrew would grow sad and disappointed again. \"Why worry about Jane Allison when Margaret is in Utah? She must be wonderful, Andrew. She would make a guid Scotch wife for you, and you like her, I'm sure.\" Why worry? That was the question he was trying so hard to answer.\n\nNE evening Andrew stood in his mother's doorway comparing Resplendence with King's Kettle. Resplendence was new and young, new land, new homes, new mountains, the great storehouses of water, homes, food, and wealth. King's Kettle was old; the soil needed constant replenishing; the homes were slowly wearing away. Just then the moon suddenly appeared from behind the clouds and spread its silvery light over his childhood home. It brought back pictures of the past. Jane was strangely in the floodlight, at home in the garden the night before he left for America; at the 749 monastery, promising to be faithful in life, faithful in death.\n\nSuddenly a sweep of emotion came over Andrew. He crossed the street and went running up the trail, along the sidehill, toward the pits. Mary saw him and ran after him. \"Andrew, Andrew, wait for me.\"\n\nTHEY climbed the hill together in silence, to the childhood trysting place. All the months of hard living on the plains, the days and nights of loneliness on the river bottoms, his precious dreams in the forest, overwhelmed him. There was no purpose in the life he had been living. Everything was gone with Jane. He sat down with his head in his hands, praying for self-control.\n\nMary began speaking softly. \"I thought it better not to even mention her name. Maybe that wasn't the right way out. Now I will tell you everything I know. For nearly two years after you left, Jane was just the same. She came to Church and to see mother once and sometimes twice a week. Then she began to change. She didn't come to Church regularly, nor to see mother so often. You know how unreasonable Herbert Allison and his wife were against the Mormons. Well, your letters were far apart, and you wrote Jane all about the trek across the plains. Jane told me she was frightened. She could never live through such an experience, she said.\n\nA few months later a man began calling at the Allison home. He was a business associate of Mr. Allison, and lived in Dumferline. He had a lot of money and property. You know what money meant to Jane. She was always the best-dressed girl at Church. Jane didn't go out with the stranger, but he continued to call. Later, they were married and made their home in Dumferline. She has riches, but not happiness. She still loves you. I met her in a store one day when I was shopping. She stopped and talked with me for a few minutes and asked about you. No, Andrew, Jane is far from being happy.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Mary. You've always been a true sister and such a comfort—pouring oil on turbulent waters.\" He smiled, took her hand, and they walked back home in the moonlight.\n\nANDREW'S peace of mind was won through the study and preaching of the gospel. He reported to his president, was assigned his companion, and they went to work. The Lord had been generous with him; he would be generous with the Lord. They studied and worked hard. They called at every home in King's Kettle and taught the gospel wherever the people would receive them. When the branch president was released, Andrew was appointed to take his place. They continued to work in King's Kettle and then went to nearby villages to tract. Finally, Andrew was made conference president and he and the elders continued to labor in the vineyard of the Lord.\n\nANDREW received many great blessings—health and peace of mind. He could see the hand of the Lord shaping his destiny, and he was a wise designer. The missionary was grateful for the hard things he had passed through; they were blessings in disguise.\n\nThen came the time his mission was completed. He was released to return home. Some months before Mary had told him of the death of Jane's husband. He received a letter from Jane, asking him to call, so he went for old time's sake. She lived in a castle, it seemed to the elder, on a street where only the rich could afford to live. He rang the doorbell. Jane answered it. She was charming, gracious, and had developed into a wonderful picture of womanliness, but Andrew was unmoved.\n\n\"I have this home, many acres of land, and a lot of money, left to me by father and my husband, and because, Andrew, I have never stopped loving you for one minute, I am asking you again not to go to Utah.\"\n\n\"My answer is the same,\" he said. \"My home and all I shall ever want are in Zion. Now that I have completed my mission, I'm returning home.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry for what I did. I did not want to hurt you, but after I read of your long walk across the continent, I could not face it. Andrew, I am no pioneer. I hate poverty, misfits, everything that goes with it. I could not come. You have loved the riches of another world, while I love the wealth of this one. Our paths are so far apart. I am in the fog. You are beyond me.\"\n\n\"My treasures belong to this world, too, Jane. I draw my interest every moment of my life, and it is mine for the asking. I am no longer in the fog. My heart and head are clear and free.\"\n\n\"Someone else?\" Jane inquired.\n\n\"Yes, Jane, I am sure there is someone else,\" Andrew said. He walked the flagged streets of Dumferline back to his childhood home. He wanted to think things through. Jane never would have been happy in the cabin or in Resplendence. How very thankful he was that she had not come.\n\nHis head was clear and free, but his heart was not free. At home in the cabin was the lass he loved. Margaret was a pioneer, and would make a wonderful wife for a pioneer. Jane would be happy in her beautiful home, with her acres of land and her money—while he would be happy in the cabin with the bairns, and with Margaret—if she cared enough for him to stay.\n\nHe prayed that he would not be too late in asking her.\n\n(To be concluded) APACHE BASKET Irene Rayner Storey Crisscross went the weaving rush, While her eyes traveled far; Infolded were the swallow's flight, And the gleam of metal star.

Mari Etta has told you so, with proper six-year-old emphasis, and she will not surrender her dolls to the gaping mouth of the trash can. Many of these, to you, wan and bedraggled beauties of last year or years before, may be glamorized for next Christmas and reside, unashamed, beneath the lighted tree with the newest doll. Spirit the retrievable ones away in the weeks before the great day and in solitary moments try transforming them into pert and new someones. Begin by examining the dolls in shops and noting the dressed-up beauties in magazines, for ideas on hair arrangements and costuming. Also, keep in mind the beloved little heroines of fairyland and fable and those well-loved ladies who lived long ago or who are still with us, and don't forget the period and nationality dolls, Dutch, French, and Oriental. Now examine your doll's hair. If it is still present in any quantity, you can comb it carefully, separate it into locks, and put it up in bobbypin curls and leave it pinned up until the day. Or you can rebraid it and tie it with fresh ribbons. If the hair is scanty and the pate looks bare, switches of gleaming locks may be purchased at the dime stores to transform the plainest miss into a glamorous heroine. One hairpiece, cut in half, should be enough for two wigs. Some stores carry bright, short curls, at very little cost. With artificial hair, plus glue, and the help of a hat, you can arrange a new wig for the doll. The hat may have to be sewed on with the wig, but a young mistress will be pleased, nevertheless. To brighten up the pale doll, wash her carefully. With a damp cloth, then with a steady hand, repaint the lips with red nail polish. Paint the finger and toenails red also. Dutch Hat Fold of Material Seam DOLLS DO NOT GROW OLD Faded eyebrows may be touched with a bit of brown oil paint. Clothes may not make the man, but a doll is different. Since her small bisque body claims no soul (except to her little mother), habiliments become her chief charm. So let her have as many and as elegant costumes as your purse and inclination allow. Gather bright, clear-colored pieces of materials—cottons, satins, velvets, laces, braid—from scrap bags or remnants from dime stores. Basque waists and bouffant skirts are easily made and are loved by children, being a refreshing escape to elegance from their own simplified wardrobes. Ribbon bows placed here and there, a touch of gay embroidery, or a flower, will make of these clothes much prettier ones than can be purchased at average prices. If you have no time for sewing doll clothes yourself, perhaps a cousin or a young neighbor would like to take over the project for a fair sum. Hats can be made of scraps of felt or velvet or braid (sewed on a paper pattern in rounds for a beautiful, floppy hat). Dutch hats, made of one piece of felt, folded and stitched down one side, are pretty and suitable to sew on to the new hair. You will find that making a doll's trousseau is a fascinating little labor of love and one both you and the daughters will remember long after they are no longer little girls. THE SIMPLE THINGS OF LIFE Geneva I. Oldroyd I love the simple things of life That come to us each day, A baby's smile, a collie's bark, A group of boys at play; A garden growing in the sun And giving of its store, A rosebush in its second bloom Of beauty as before; My neighbor's nod across the fence, The postman's friendly smile, The sociability of friends— All these make life worth while. THE DEAREST SPOT Eunice J. Miles A place of peace, A rendezvous from harm, A roof against the gale To keep us warm; A cozy kitchen Where a kettle sings, And children prattle Over the artless things, Where love and friendliness Hold greatest worth— This is our home, The dearest spot on earth, Then—and Now! Sadie Ollerton Clark AST June my husband, David, our youngest son, and I took a brief vacation from the coastal plains of Texas. We had a happy reunion with friends in Utah, picked up Reid, another son who had just finished a school term at the State university, and turned the green Chevrolet south to Arizona, over the Grand Canyon bridge. We had planned on one more cool evening before we faced the heat of the Salt River Valley, and thought it would be a treat to the boys to stay overnight on the north rim of the canyon. But after an afternoon of climbing and sightseeing, both boys declared they would rather go on. It would be cooler to ride through the desert at night, they said, and we could sleep comfortably at Flagstaff. \"Flagstaff is such a long way,\" I protested. \"It will take us all night to get there.\" \"It is just a four or five-hour drive,\" declared our eldest. \"We can be there before midnight.\" Knowing from past experience he could outargue me, and also that he was generally right, I found my place in the back seat of the car. We drove through the beautiful meadows of the Kaibab just as the sun was shedding its last rays. On one side of the road we could see deer and cattle grazing together, and on the other, a stately stag posing on a cliff, as if for a picture. Then, as my husband took my hand, I knew that he, as well as I, was seeing this scene twice—now, and as it looked twenty-four years ago when he brought me, his bride, to this lovely spot for our honeymoon. The mountains and pastures looked just the same. The deer and cattle together could have been an identical picture. But on that turn of the road where one white-tailed doe bounded lightly into the forest we remembered a band of twenty-five bucks.\n\nWe had surprised dozens of the delicate little creatures who had given us startled glances and darted away. Either not so many deer, I thought, or they keep hidden better. And I looked in vain for the whitetailed, black squirrels which I remembered were formerly everywhere. The moon was coming up as we left the great forest and started down the historic hill to the desert. Twenty-four years ago we would not have dared cross it at such an hour. Then, we had looked down upon the same scenes—the interminable range of low, red mountains so symbolic of this country, with the only landmark in all those endless desert miles a low rock house at the foot of the hill. My thoughts traveled backward.... Leigh and I started down that rocky trail which (nearly a quarter of a century ago) served for a road. We saw a car near the rock house and two men, probably a quarter of a mile away, climbing toward us. As they came closer they hailed us, and we looked to our water supply, for we thought they would surely need a drink. But as THEN—AND NOW\n\nWe approached them they waved a small canteen at us and swore mildly.\n\n\"Wouldn't you know it—just a couple of kids! Where on earth are you heading for?\"\n\n\"Flagstaff, and on to Phoenix.\"\n\n\"Flagstaff!\" One of them sat weakly on the tuning board while the other cried, \"Take a fool's advice and turn back. You will never make it.\" They told us their story. They had been stuck in the sand, time after time, and had dug themselves out with their bare and blistered hands. They had been four days crossing the desert, and when they reached the rock house they had had to abandon their car because their gasoline supply was exhausted. We talked to them a few minutes, but assured them we were going on. They refused our offer of water and continued their climb, shaking their heads, while we jolted down over the sharp rocks of the old wagon road.\n\nThis was not the first time we had been discouraged. The day before, a few miles out of Kanab, we had partially broken a spring. The owner of a combined livery stable and garage sold us a used one, but when we told him we intended to cross Lee's Ferry he was surprised.\n\n\"Why didn't you go by way of California?\" he asked. \"You'll never make it this way.\"\n\nWe explained that we had intended going another route. In fact, we had been in Yellowstone Park the previous week, and before we dared start for the Pacific Coast we had telegraphed for advice on getting into Arizona from California. Our answer had been to avoid California 755 as Arizona had a quarantine against California cars in June of 1924 because of a raging epidemic of hoof and mouth disease. Cars had been held up at the bridges for weeks, and there was no relief in sight, so we had decided to try Lee's Ferry.\n\nOur adviser was still pessimistic. He said we would get stuck in the sand, that he had taken a party to the Ferry just a few days before, and that he charged fifty dollars for the trip, but after these people had seen the road they had given him one hundred dollars. But we couldn't afford even fifty dollars. It had taken practically every cent we had to spare to buy that spring for the car.\n\nWe weren't afraid, but we hated to appear too self-confident, so we left him, saying we would go on to the canyon and decide what to do then. There was no hotel at the north rim in 1924, so we camped out. The business of the canyon seemed to be centered in a big, log store and post office. Just after dark we walked toward it.\n\nComing through the windows we heard strange and unearthly sounds of music, accompanied by weird shrieks and wails. Curiously, and a little frightened, we pushed our way into the big room and watched a man engaged in one of the favorite pastimes of the day—working the dial of a home-built radio and trying to find every station he could reach. It was my first encounter with a radio!\n\nLeigh talked to some of the men gathered there. When they learned we were planning to go across Lee's Ferry, they looked at us in amazement. I don't recall that they actually told us not to try to 756 go, but one after another started telling some pretty tall stories, or so they sounded to me.\n\nI can picture one of the men now, long and lean, wearing high-heeled boots and Stetson hat and faded overalls. He waved his hand toward the great chasm and pointed out some dim and flickering lights from the blackness beyond.\n\n\"See those lights?\" he said. \"Well, last summer an old party came here late in the afternoon—him and his wife in a big Packard limousine with a Negro chauffeur. They turned up their noses at our accommodations here but decided to spend the night in one of the cabins. When it was dark enough to see the lights, the man asked where they were coming from, and I told him they were from El 'Tovar, the big hotel on the south rim.\"\n\n\"How far is it across?\" he says.\n\n\"Thirteen miles,\" I say.\n\n\"He turned to his wife and said, 'Let's go over for dinner and stay there.'\"\n\nWell, we all thought he was joking, so we all chipped in and said, \"Yes, why don't you? It's an easy drive, only thirteen miles,\" and so on. We couldn't understand how ignorant a feller could be about distances out here. But when we saw they were actually taking us serious and were putting their bags in the car we changed our tune.\n\nWe told him he couldn't drive to the other side that night. It was 135 miles of no roads at all, and he couldn't carry enough gas in that big Packard to get him over there.\n\nWell, this old guy had taken us serious at first, and now for a while he thought we were joking. When he found out we meant it, he got stubborn and accused us of trying to make them stay in this wild place. We finally persuaded him to fill his tank and take five gallons of gas extra.\n\nBut this old boy, he had an awful time. He made it to the Ferry all night, but the next day he ran out of gas. There wasn't a chance of anyone coming along that road who could help him, so he left his wife and the colored man and started to walk. He walked all day, lost in those hot, dry hills, but finally found an Indian camp, and bought some kerosene. It took him all the next day to get back to the car, and another day to get to the Little Colorado, to a filling station.\n\nThey had run out of water and were nearly dead when they finally reached El Tovar. He said all he wanted to do was to get out of this forsaken country and he would never come back. He had enough of western scenery to last him all the rest of his life!\" All the men laughed and several recalled the circumstances. Others had more stories to tell, but Leigh and I said nothing. The next morning we took a last look at the magnificent gorge and started back through the Kaibab. At Jacob's Lake, Leigh stopped the car and asked, \"Which way?\" I answered, \"Don't be silly. We've got to get home.\" \"Hail, oh, hail to Arizona!\" sang my husband as we drove through the wonderful Kaibab Forest to the top of the hill. \"Jumping off place,\" I called it. It was there we had met the two men. We were soon on the desert, trying to follow a poor semblance of a road. It was never too clearly defined. Sometimes we just drove south, but sooner or later we found the trail. The year 1924 was unusually dry, and there wasn't a green plant anywhere. Off in the distance, not far from the rock house, we saw a herd of wild buffalo. They looked weak and disheartened from lack of food and water. We wondered if they would be alive by August.\n\nWe were stuck in the sand several times, but Leigh had had foresight enough to bring a shovel. We would put brush under the wheel, dig a little, and the famous pulling power of the old 1917 Dodge would get us out of that hole. Late in the afternoon we knew we were nearing the river, as we could see signs of green, which could be cottonwood trees. Just before we reached the Ferry we came onto a most interesting scene. In one sand area were hundreds of balanced rocks and peculiar formations. Delightedly, we took pictures. Then on a sandstone cliff we saw a carved date—1879.\n\n\"Grandfather Noble came over this road about that date, when he moved his family to Arizona,\" said Leigh.\n\nThe ruggedness of the country, the silence and absence of any life made me wonder if we were the first humans to travel this road since! But at the Ferry we were received casually enough. The man who collected our dollar said he ferried a car across every few days, and saw no hardships ahead. It was a thrill to put the car on the historic, old Ferry. I tried to ask questions about the history of the place, but our pilot didn't seem anxious to talk, although he did tell us that a few years before the cable broke and the boat got out of control. I wondered if the passengers had been asking too many questions at the time.\n\nThe green cottonwoods and willow trees gave a grateful shade to the hot country. We saw snatches of gardens and fruit trees, but the ferryman's business was to get us across the river, which he did, with dispatch. We climbed \"Lee's Backbone,\" the rocky hill on the south side of the river, about sunset. Leigh recalled his mother's stories about crossing this road as a young girl. Her father had been sent by the Church as a bishop to a small Arizona town, and they had traveled these wearisome desert miles by team and wagon. It took them a month, and one of the nightmare spots of the trip had been the climb up \"Lee's Backbone.\"\n\nWe blessed the Dodge for its comparative speed and endurance, and drove on about ten miles, congratulating ourselves on making the terrible journey with so little trouble. Then, as it was beginning to get dark, we made our camp.\n\nIn those days there were few road maps, and for some reason, probably because the people who had tried to frighten us had nearly always emphasized the danger of the north side of the Ferry, we thought we were practically to Flagstaff. Because the air was heavily loaded, Leigh threw away our big can of water, and we lay there in that wilderness, listening to the coyotes howling and promised ourselves we would sleep in a hotel the next night.\n\nI suppose it was because we thought we would surely get somewhere soon that made the next day so long. It seemed almost endless. The rocks of the \"jumping-off place\" hill had cut into our tires and we had to stop and patch one every hour or so. The road wasn't so bad, but it didn't seem to lead any place. Once we came upon some fresh wagon tracks, and followed them twenty miles, only to find that they turned around and came back over the same ruts. Forty miles lost! We put a few rocks in the road to discourage the next traveler from making our mistake, and went on. But our water supply was running low and we bitterly regretted leaving the big can behind.\n\nLate that afternoon we reached the \"Little Colorado\" trading post. The river was dry, but the store was open. A woman waited on us, and expressed no surprise at seeing us. She allowed us only one canteen of water for ourselves and the car. We decided to drive on, no matter how long it took us, when we heard the now tragically familiar sound of another blowout. In disgust, Leigh pulled off the road. \"I can't fix another one tonight,\" he said wearily. \"We will just camp here and go on in the morning.\"\n\nWe put up the cot. There was only a swallow or two of water left in the canteen, and we laughingly made a ceremony of drinking it. Then we lay down to the most fantastic dreams. They were all about water. We were swimming in it, sailing on it, but when we reached for a drink it was gone.\n\nWe were awakened from this uneasy slumber by the sound of a car passing us, and we thought we heard someone laugh. We sat up in bed and looked about us. It was barely light, but Leigh recognized the place. We had made our bed in a triangle of grass which marked a junction of three roads—one west to Flagstaff, one east to Albuquerque, and the northern one we had traveled!\n\nI had fallen asleep as my tall son drove swiftly across the same old desert on well-paved roads, and I was awakened by a display of neon signs and flashing lights.\n\n\"This is the junction,\" Reid said. \"It will be in Flagstaff in a few minutes.\"\n\n\"The junction!\" I cried. \"I remember this place. And I'm thirsty!\"\n\nThen I smiled, a little embarrassed, even after all these years.\n\n\"If there had been a few lights twenty-four years ago we wouldn't have been caught in such a predicament,\" I explained, mostly to myself. \"But what time is it?\"\n\nIt was just four hours since we had left Jacob's Lake.\n\n\"It's too short a time even to realize where we've been,\" I said.\n\n\"Would you rather have it the way it was before?\" jibed my youngest.\n\nWould I? Well, I'll have to admit I appreciate all the comfort I can get when I travel these days. But take twenty-four years from my age and give me the same boyish companion, and I would still be thrilled to face the unknown. For if you never get off the paved highway, and can make a month's journey in four hours, where is the excitement, or the fun, or the adventure? \n\nSEASONING (Continued) 759 Seasoning (Continued from page 743)\n\n\"Now, what are you thinking?\" Maury demanded.\n\"Of your father's house.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"PM remembering how small it was, and how there was always room for people—always room for the hungry, the cold, the cast out. - - everyone who needed food and friendship.\"\nShe laughed.\n\"Hard put we were at times to make it go, but that is where my father's thrift was right welcome.\"\n\"That's what I mean,\" he said. \"Some people, who have little, have so much. And some, who have much, have nothing at all.\"\nHe looked about him.\n\"Gosh! I have a lot to learn, like how it's not the food that makes Thanksgiving, but the seasonings from the heart.\"\nShe nodded.\n\"Aye, I know.\"\nShe looked at the clock.\n\"You must hurry now. You must not be late for her dinner.\"\nJohn pursued the last shred of turkey.\n\"Maury, did I ever tell you that red is my favorite shade of hair?\"\nShe paused, fork in midair.\nTears sprang suddenly upon her glowing cheeks.\n\"Nay, you didna'.. You really find it fair?\" \n\"T find it fair,\" John repeated.\n\nWILD GEESE\nBeatrice K. Ekman\n\nAbove the marshes and reed-fringed lagoon,\nI hear the wild geese honking in their flight;\nBathed in the luster of the hunter's moon,\nThey dip their wings down trackless lanes of night.\nOver the coarse marsh grass pale vapors rise,\nOn the dark lake a bright moon-path is drawn,\nAs, faint and faraway, the honking dies\nAnd wild geese merge with moonbeams and are gone.\n\nI WAIT FOR SPRING\nGrace Sayre\n\nI shall pause long when autumn's golden flame\nBurns in the maple's glory, to its last dim ash.\nI cannot bear earth's poignant claim,\nGraying to embers in a wintry blast.\nThe leaves that drift beyond the garden wall\nWill rest in golden layers on the sod;\nBut I must not look back to see them fall.\nI pause.... While empty boughs commune with God.\nAnd who am I to gaze on nature's pall?\nI wait for spring where autumn's gold is massed,\nAnd by these symbols, know the year has passed.\n\nA Party for You\nSara Mills\n\nHERE'S party blood in your veins. Read one of the old pioneer diaries. It will tell of furniture pushed outside to make room for dancing feet. Any pretext was enough: a visitor, a person about to go visiting, or no pretext at all. Often as not the party lasted through the night to morning chore time. It was these parties that kept gaiety alive in the bleak days.\n\nNow, in far-removed 1948, you have an essential need to keep gaiety nourished. Give at least one party this holiday season. The memory of it will leave a warm glow to help you up the steep, cold ascent of the January and February hills.\n\nWe're passing on to you a menu for a party dinner you can engineer single-handed, if need be. The dinner is an easy one, but so good it will set the tempo for a fine, blithe evening.\n\nRoast turkey is the main dish (as cheap as any other in these days). It is abetted by potatoes au gratin in an elegant guise; a salad that can be made the day before, and a fruitcake. This may be the one you made in November, or the mincemeat fruitcake listed on the menu.\n\nFor bread, buy clover-leaf rolls and break them in threes for serving. Dress your turkey the night before, down to the last stitch. Also make your salad the day before, and prepare your potatoes. The dinner is self-serving, of course. Because your oven will be turkey occupied in the afternoon, set your potatoes to bake in the casserole the first thing in the morning. Then keep them covered on top of the oven, popping them in the last thing to be re-heated.\n\nFor a drink, use your favorite fruit-juice concoction, hot or cold.\n\nMENU\n\nRoast turkey with dressing warm\nPotatoes au gratin\nPear jello\nCelery with avocado cheese relish\nCranberry sauce\nMincemeat fruitcake\nClover-leaf rolls\nFruit drink\n\nPOTATOES AU GRATIN\n\nPotatoes (boiled in skins, approximately one large one to two persons)\nThin cheese sauce (about 1/2 cup of grated American cheese to each pint of thin white sauce)\nBread crumbs (fine and dry)\n1 large onion, sliced\nWorcestershire sauce\nButter, salt, and pepper\n\nBoil the potatoes in their jackets. When they are cool, slice them in smallish pieces and place them in a large dish. Season with salt and scatter slices of raw onion throughout the potatoes. Cover and leave in a cool place overnight.\n\nNext morning, remove all onion slices. Make a thin white sauce of butter, flour, and milk. Add the seasonings and the grated American cheese. In a large casserole, place alternate layers of potatoes, bread crumbs, and cheese sauce, topping the dish with a thin layer of crumbs. Dust lightly with pepper and dot with butter. Place in a low oven, about 250°, and bake for two hours.\n\nTaste well for seasoning, have plenty of the thin cheese sauce, and bake slowly. You will have a dish of rarely blended flavors.\n\nA PARTY FOR YOU\n\nPEAR JELLO\n1 package lime jello\n2 cups liquid\n1 can or quart bottle of pears\n2 small packages cream cheese\n1 pinch ginger\n1 tbs. Vinegar\n\nDissolve jello in 1 cup of boiling water and add 1 cup of pear juice. Pour half of the jello, with vinegar added, into a flat pan. Put in ice box. Place remaining jello in bowl and when it is congealed, beat with a rotary egg beater. Cream the cheese smoothly with a fork; add gradually to the beaten jello. Add ginger and pears cut in pieces, and place on top of plain jello. Chill.\n\nFor a large party you will need to double this recipe.\n\nAVOCADO CHEESE RELISH\n\n1 cup finely mashed avocado\n2 tsp. Lemon juice\n4 3/4 cup sieved Roquefort cheese\n1 tbs.

    "content": "The Practice of Consonants for Better Singing\nFlorence Jepperson Madsen Member, Relief Society General Board\n\nHe who knows how to breathe and how to pronounce, knows well how to sing (Pacchiarotti).\n\nTHERE are various approaches to the improvement of word resonance and clarity in speech and song. One of these is to quickly leave the consonant and sustain the vowel. This should be practiced with the following syllables: may, may, may, etc.\n\nMe, me, me; my, my, my; mah, mah, mah; mo, mo, mo, moo, moo, moo.\n\nAfter practicing these alone combine them, as for example: me, may, mah; my, may, me; mah, mo, moo; me, may, mo; me, may, my, mah, mo, moo, etc.\n\nWhen moderate facility has been gained in singing the above exercises replace the M with the consonants: B, P, N, L, D, T, W, etc. The L is particularly useful in effecting tongue flexibility.\n\nAfter sufficient technique has been acquired in vowel and consonant articulation, definite words should be used to apply this skill. With this objective in view, the following list of words should be practiced both in speaking and in singing:\n\nMay, Bay, Pay\nMaun, Dawn, Pawn\nMayme, Name, Lame\nMy, By, Lie\nMate, Bate, Date\nMight, Bite, Night\n\nMah, Bah, Paw\nMile, Dial, Tile\nMall, Doll, Ball\nMow, Bow, Doe\nMote, Dote, Note\nMole, Toll, Dole\n\nMe, Be, Lea\nMeet, Beet, Neat\nMeal, Deal, Peel\nMoo, Boo, Too\nMoon, Boon, Doon\nMood, Food, Wooed\n\nThese groups of three words should be increased to include others—words commencing and ending with different consonants, sustaining the vowels longer and longer. Practice all syllables and words first on one particular pitch, then on different pitches, scale and chordwise.\n\nSing the exercises in the easy range of the voice and according to definite rhythmical patterns. When three syllables are sung the triplet group may be employed to good advantage and practiced sequentially up and down the scale.\n\nWhen syllables and words beginning with a single consonant have been learned, attention should be turned to the study of double consonants preceding a vowel, such as the following:\n\nBlay, Blee, Blah, Blow, Bloo\nFlay, Flee, Flaw, etc.\nPlay, Plee, Plah, etc.\nDray, Dree, Drah, etc. (The R is slightly trilled with the tip of the tongue.)\n\nThe articulation of consonants, single or double, should be short and distinct, the sustained vowel being the tone.\n\nClear, flexible speech is a prerequisite to beautiful singing.\n\n[Note: The short articles on music which appear in the Magazine may form the basis for the discussion in the choristers' and organists' department at union meeting.]\n\nPage 769:\nDEPARTMENT\nTheology—The Life and Ministry of the Savior\nLesson 13—\"The Apostolic Mission and Events Related Thereto\"\nElder Don B. Colton (Reference: Jesus the Christ, Chapter 21, by Elder James E. Talmage)\n\nFor Tuesday, February 1, 1949\n\nObjective: To show how those who put their trust in the Lord gain spiritual power and knowledge.\n\nNote: All quotations which are not followed by references are taken from the text Jesus the Christ.\n\nFOLLOWING the events described in our last lesson, Jesus returned for a brief visit to Nazareth. The people there had rejected him once but he was willing to give them another chance. He is always merciful and willing to forgive. He went to the synagogue and they were astonished at the marvelous work he had done. However, the people were looking for a Messiah and rejected him a second time. They said he was the \"... Son of Mary, the brother of James and Joses, and Juda and Simon.\" His relatives were plain folk. \"And they were offended at him.\"\n\nAt Nazareth, Jesus did not accomplish any great work because of lack of faith among the people.\n\nThe Twelve Charged and Sent\n\nThe work of the ministry needed expanding. Jesus sent forth his apostles on separate missions to preach the gospel. They had been students under the Master for many months; now they were to leave him and commence the work that Page 770 ultimately took them into all parts of the known world.\n\nAt first they were to go only to \"the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\" These were to be given the first chance. This was only a temporary restriction. Later they were to go among all nations.\n\nAlways they were to preach, \"the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\"\n\nThey were given the Priesthood and told to \"Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give\" (Matt. 10:8). They were to rely upon divine aid for all their needs.\n\nThey were not to take money and were not even to take thought of their lives.?\n\nTherefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? (Matt. 6:25).\n\nAll these things were to be provided if they would have faith.\n\nThey were told:\n\nBut seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you (Matt. 6:33).\nThe apostles were not to give offense. They were sent as sheep among wolves. The Lord would guide them. Jesus said to them: \"For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you\" (Matt. 10:20).\n\nThe Lord well knew that families would be divided and much strife would result when children would be arrayed against parents and neighbor against neighbor. The apostles would be hated and would endure much suffering, but they ought not to expect a life of ease. Their Master had not escaped. If they were faithful, their Father would watch over them. The love of their work must supercede every other thing.\n\nWith these important instructions and the knowledge that the Holy Ghost would guide them, they left on their missions. Jesus continued his personal ministry.\n\nThe length of time the apostles were gone on their missions is not given. Their labors greatly increased the spread of the gospel of the kingdom. In the meantime, Jesus continued his marvelous work. It is easy to understand how his fame had spread far and wide and was causing much excitement. Herod Antipas had given the order for John the Baptist to be killed, and since his death, he was afraid of the people. He averred that Jesus was the Baptist returned from the tomb.\n\nThe Twelve Return\n\nThe report of the apostles, when they returned, was very encouraging. They had taken the message wherever they had gone. In each of the cities or towns they had visited, they had preached the gospel of repentance. They had anointed the sick with oil and, by the power of the Priesthood, the afflicted ones had been healed. In fact, they had done mighty works among the people.\n\nAfter their return, Jesus took the Twelve to the desert for a brief rest, but eager crowds followed them. As the multitude gathered on the hillside whither they had gone, Jesus looked upon the vast throng with pity. He first taught them many things, healed their sick and comforted them.\n\nCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light (Matt. 11:28-30).\n\nFive Thousand Fed in the Desert\n\nThe crowd was so interested that evening came on before they realized the passing of time. It was springtime and the people could stay all night, but they had no food.\n\nThe disciples urged Jesus to send the people away:\nBut Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes. He said, Bring them hither to me. And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full. And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children (Matt. 14:16-21).\n\nHuman knowledge is powerless to explain the miracle. It was done by the power of God. The Creator, however, taught a great lesson against waste. Barley bread and fish contributed the chief diet of the people in that region. The Master had them gather the broken meat and bread and there was much more left than the whole of the original supply. The people soon began to discuss the miracle. This was the Messiah for whom they were looking. He had power to feed them. They started a movement to proclaim him king to reign instead of the unpopular Herod. However, Jesus dismissed the now excited multitude and directed his apostles to leave by boat. Ascending the hill alone he spent most of the night in prayer.\n\nJesus Walks Upon the Water\n\nThe return trip by boat proved to be a memorable journey for the disciples. A storm arose and the small ship toiled heavily in a rough sea. The men could not use the sails and could survive only by holding the vessel by sheer strength. Jesus knew of their plight and came to their rescue by walking on the storm-tossed waters. When the disciples saw him coming, they thought he was a ghost and were frightened.\n\nBut straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I, be not afraid. And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased. Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God (Matt. 14:27-33).\n\nThis event was a demonstration that faith is a principle of power. It only we could have faith, the Lord would say to our troubled souls, \"It is I, be not afraid.\"\n\nIn the Land of Gennesaret\n\nThey landed near a place called Gennesaret—one of the beauty spots of that region. From there, they journeyed north to Capernaum. In the towns through which they passed, \"the sick were laid in the streets, that the blessing of his passing might fall upon them.\" In fact, they \"besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole\" (Matt. 14:36).\n\nIn Search of Loaves and Fishes\n\nJesus soon discovered that the people who had been fed in the desert were seeking him again that they might partake of his bounty. The Lord rebuked them, saying:\n. . . Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled (John 6:26).\n\nThey wanted to follow one who would feed them.\n\nThe Lord then gave some vital instructions:\nLabour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed (John 6:27).\n\nIt was hard for them to understand. He urged them to believe in him and obey his gospel. They knew that while Moses led their fathers, the Lord had provided manna. They had seen the miracle of the loaves and fishes. Why could they not believe now in Jehovah? Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus the Christ of the New Testament.\n\nChrist, the Bread of Life\nThen Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world (John 6:32-33).\nYour fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead . . . if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever . . . (John 6:49, 51).\nOnce before the Lord had given similar ideas when he spake to the woman of Samaria (John 4:13-15):\nThough within the reach of all who diligently strive to gain it, faith is nevertheless a divine gift, and can be obtained only from Christ.\nJesus said, \"I am the bread of life.\" That bread, he stated, was his flesh. \"Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day\" (John 6:54). The symbolism of bread and water is, perhaps, more difficult for us to understand on first reading than it was for the Jews. \"The idea of eating, as a metaphor for receiving spiritual benefit, was familiar to Christ's hearers, and was as readily understood as our expressions 'devouring a book,' or 'drinking in instructions.' \" 'The ribbis,' . . . laid it down as a rule, that wherever, in Ecclesiastes, allusion was made to food or drink, it meant study of the law, and the practice of good works\" (Geikie. Life and Words of Christ, 1, page 184; page 43 textbook). By the symbolism, Jesus taught that we were to believe in him as the literal Son of God and keep his commandments.\nHowever, it must not be overlooked that his doctrine was difficult for the Jews to accept.\nMany therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it? (John 6:60).\n\". . . Doth this offend you? What if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?\" (John 6:61-62). Surely it was implied that after his death and resurrection he would ascend to his Father. Only through the Holy Ghost can these great truths be known. \"It is the spirit that quickeneth.. I From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him\" (John 6:63, 66). This evoked the inquiry from Jesus unto the Twelve: \"Will ye also go away?\" Peter answered with deep conviction: Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life. And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God (John 6:67-69).\nThough they did not fully understand all the doctrine, \"they knew Jesus to be the Christ.\"\nQuestions and Suggestions for Discussion,\n1. Enumerate the powers that were given to the apostles of Jesus when they were sent forth on their first great missions. Tell also of the duties required of them.\n2. Read Matt. 11:28-30 and tell of your own happiness found in the service of the Lord.\n3. Give an account of the feeding of the multitude by the Savior.\n4. Did the Savior mean it literally when he said, \"Ye are the salt of the earth..— Ye are the light of the world,\" etc.\nVisiting Teachers Messages—Ou\" Savior Speaks\nLesson 5—Judge Not That Ye Be Not Judged\"\nElder H. Wayne Driggs\nFor Tuesday, February 1, 1949\nObjective: To point out that it is not our place to pass judgment on another.\nWHEN the Savior gave us the injunction \"Judge not, that ye be not judged,\" he set for his followers a standard which is hard to live up to. This is because it seems natural for all of us, in our finite state, to see the imperfections of our own. Not once, but many times did the Savior teach those who gathered round him that they gave them Later, to the scribes and the Pharisees he made it clear that even they whose office it was to interpret the law, must not condemn the woman taken in sin, for they themselves \"Let him who is without sin, cast the first stone,\" he said. He tells us to substitute mercy for harsh judgment.\nBe ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful. Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven (Luke 6:36-37).\nBecause of our human frailties there will always be flaws in our natures. It is easy to sit in judgment upon another, but it is unjust to do so since we cannot know all the circumstances that may have contributed towards an act. The Savior knew that only God can render a just judgment, for he alone knows the intents of one's heart. Outward appearances and actions may be misunderstood and misconstrued. There is no living man who is all-wise and who can judge the justice of an act from its inception in the mind to its final result.\nAlbeit the Lord has given to some of his servants, including the bishop of the ward, to be common judges, and to such persons so authorized, gives them wisdom and discernment and inspiration sufficient to qualify them to act in this high place. \"Judge not, that ye be not judged\" (Matthew 7:1).\nWork Meeting—Sewing (A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting)\nLesson 5—Outmoded Formals\nJean Ridges Jennings\nFor Tuesday, 'February 15, 1949\nPERHAPS the one article in a woman's wardrobe which gives the least value for the money expended is the formal. Often there is no room in the family budget for a mother's formal, and if there is she hesitates to buy one because she feels she won't get enough wear from it.\nFormals need not be considered wasteful or extravagant if we extend their usefulness by making them over into attractive articles of clothing after we have grown tired of them as formals or when they have become outmoded. One might even be farsighted enough to plan the new formal with a view to using it later for some other purpose.\nFor first consideration is the possibility of shortening a formal and either dyeing it or combining it with other material for use as an afternoon or street dress. This, of course is done only if it can be made appropriate to the occasion. Or why not have a dressy negligee or house coat for a feeling of luxury in those few odd moments of leisure lounging? Often, when a fancy housecoat or robe is an extravagance, an old evening gown can be converted into something of this sort that may give much pleasure.\nAs has been stated many times before, one must always be careful to make sure that the color and type of material in garments that are made over is becoming to the individual who is to wear the garment. In some cases little girl's dresses can be fashioned from old formals.\n\nIf the material is dainty in color and launderable, it is especially usable for this purpose. With the current trend for fuller, longer skirts there is a strong fad for ruffled petticoats. Where is a more logical place to turn for the material from which to make one than to old formals? Taffetas, satins, and other slick materials are usually good to use, and any color in the rainbow, or combination of colors is in vogue. From dresses of washable materials and pastel colors, other undergarments can be made both for children and grownups. Use such dresses for slips, panties, and camisoles. Here, again, is a source of material for blouses. The possibilities are almost unlimited. There is no end to the kinds and colors of material from which one could make a blouse. Whether eyelet pique, silk crepe, taffeta, sheer chiffon, or even heavy brocade, most everyone could fit the blouse into her wardrobe for varieties of occasions. And, as a last suggestion, consider the possibility of redecorating a bedroom with ruffles fashioned from the skirt of an old formal. Make a new skirt for the dressing table, a ruffle around the edge of a mirror, fluffy bows for curtain tie-backs. Or you could even disguise a shabby table or makeshift for a table with a full circular flounce falling to the floor that you made from your old dress.\n\nLiterature Literature of the Latter-day Saints\nLiterature of the Gospel Restoration Lesson 5—Earlier Evangelistic Literature Elder Howard R. Driggs\n\nFor Tuesday, February 15, 1949\n\nFERVOR to share the enriched truths of the restored gospel—to radiate its glorious new light—naturally brought some stirring evangelistic literature. Missionaries, as soon as the Church had been organized, were sent forth. Not only did they voice the glad tidings whenever they found folk to listen, but gradually they used pen and press to spread the newly revealed word of God farther and wider. It was all impelled by a desire to share—to keep the good things that had come by giving them to others. Indeed one can keep the gospel bright and beautiful only by sharing it. Zeal to do this vibrates through the writings of those earlier missionaries. It still does in the work of today.\n\nTwo things, however, seem to add to the intensity of the early-day earnestness: first, the nearness to the Prophet and to the divine drama of the restoration; second, the testing hardships and bitter persecution that had to be met and overcome. We are brought closer to all this in the Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt, one of the outstanding missionaries who lived through those soul-searching, early-day experiences.\n\nWith Oliver Cowdery, Peter Whitmer, and Ziba Peterson, Parley was on the first official mission—this to the Lamanites on the Missouri frontier. A few paragraphs from his Autobiography, a volume of high literary merit, will help make the story live again.\n\nThe four elders, after traveling afoot for hundreds of miles, and meeting with outstanding success in converting folk in and around Kirtland, Ohio, finally found themselves in Illinois, where they were halted, \"by a dreadful storm of rain and snow, which lasted for a week or more. Although in the midst of strangers,\" writes Elder Pratt, \"we were kindly entertained, found many friends, and preached to large congregations in several neighborhoods.\"\n\nHis story continues:\n\nIn the beginning of 1831 we renewed our journey; and passing through St. Louis and St. Charles, we travelled on foot for three hundred miles through vast prairies and through trackless wilds of snow—no beaten road; houses few and far between; and the bleak northwest wind always blowing in our faces with a keenness which would almost take the skin off the face. We travelled for whole days, from morning till night, without a house or fire, wading in snow to the knees at every step. . . . We carried on our backs our changes of clothing, several books, and corn bread and raw pork. We often ate our frozen bread and pork by the way, when the bread would be so frozen that we could not bite or penetrate any part of it but the outside crust (Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt, chapter VII).\n\nOn reaching Independence—gateway town to the untamed West—two of the elders found employment as tailors to help, while Oliver Cowdery and Parley P. Pratt crossed the frontier line and commenced a mission among the Indians. The first night was passed with the Shawnees, then the elders went over the Kansas River to work among the Delawares. There they found the principal chief—\"a venerable looking man\" held in reverence as \"the great-grandfather, or Sachem of ten nations or tribes.\" The two missionaries were made welcome by this Indian leader; and after he learned, through an interpreter, of their errand, particularly something of the Bible they brought, he called a council. Oliver Cowdery then addressed the red men. His words, as recorded by Elder Pratt, in part, follow:\n\nThousands of moons ago, when the red men's forefathers dwelt in peace and possessed this whole land, the Great Spirit talked with them, and revealed His law and His will, and much knowledge to their wise men and prophets. This they wrote in a Book; together with their history, and the things which should befall their children in the latter days.\n\nThis Book was written on plates of gold, and handed down from father to son for many ages and generations.\n\nIt was then that the people prospered, and were strong and mighty; they cultivated the earth; built buildings and cities, and abounded in all good things, as the pale faces now do.\n\nBut they became wicked; they killed one another and shed much blood; they killed their prophets . . . and sought to destroy the Book. The Great Spirit became angry, and would speak to them no more ....\nThis Book, which contained these things, was hid in the earth by Moroni, in a hill called by him, Cumorah ....\nIn that neighborhood there lived a young man named Joseph Smith, who prayed to the Great Spirit much, in order that he might know the truth; and the Great Spirit sent an angel to him, and told him where this Book was hid by Moroni; and commanded him to go and get it. He accordingly went to the place, and dug in the earth, and found the Book written on gold plates.\nBut it was written in the language of the forefathers of the red man; therefore this young man, being a pale face, could not understand it; but the angel told him and showed him, and gave him a knowledge of the language and how to interpret the Book. So he interpreted it into the language of the pale faces, and wrote it on paper, and caused it to be printed ....\n\nSo we have now come from him, and here is a copy of the Book, which we now present to our red friend, the chief of the Delawares, and which we hope he will cause to be read and known among his tribe; it will do them good.\nObserve here, how Oliver Cowdery, with teaching skill, meets the minds of his listeners simply, concretely, and in terms the Indians could understand. This is real literary art. It was in a dramatic setting—worthy of portrayal by a gifted painter.\nThe response of the Indian chief is likewise picturesque and touching:\nWe feel truly thankful to our white friends who have come so far, and been at such pains to tell us good news, and especially this new news concerning the Book of our forefathers; it makes us glad in here (placing his hand on his heart).\nIt is now winter, we are new settlers in this place; the snow is deep, our cattle and horses are dying; our wigwams are poor; we have much to do in the spring—to build houses, and fence and make farms; but we will build a council house, and meet together, and you shall read to us and teach us more concerning the Book of our fathers and the will of the Great Spirit (Ibid., chapter VIII).\nThese good intentions unfortunately could not be carried out. Rising interest on the part of the Indians in Mormonism brought immediate opposition to missionary work among them. Indian agents, stirred doubtless by sectarian enmity, ordered our elders, with threat of using military force, off the reservation.\nThe elders left to continue their work for a time around Independence. It is interesting to note that the very same year our Latter-day Saint missionaries were trying to carry the restored gospel to the Indians, 1831, four chieftains from the farther Northwest came down the Missouri River to St. Louis seeking what they called \"The White Man's Book of Heaven.\" Two of these red men died that winter in the frontier city; the other two returned to their people in the wilds, disappointed; they had been given gifts enough, as one of them said, \"to make our moccasins heavy,\" but the light of the gospel they sought had not been given to them. Their people must still \"sit in darkness.\" Had the Latter-day Saint missionaries been permitted to carry forward their work, the desire of the red men for light and truth might at the time have been splendidly gratified.\nAlthough this first mission of our four young elders, so far as the Indians were concerned, was thwarted, there was rich fruitage from it elsewhere. Not alone in Kirtland, where a religious leader, Sidney Rigdon, and practically his whole congregation, joined the Latter-day Saints, but elsewhere along their route, the elders gathered hundreds into the fold. It was the beginning of a great missionary work, leading to the calling of many others into the service of spreading the gospel far and wide.\nAll of this zeal was inspired by the Prophet, who gave himself untiringly to the labor of love for mankind. His devoted brother Samuel had pioneered the carrying of the gospel into the wider field when he went forth alone to try to sell the Book of Mormon. Though generally rebuffed and unwelcomed on his humble mission, Samuel did place one copy of the Book where it reached Brigham Young, and through him, Heber C. Kimball. A first convert made by Parley P. Pratt was his own brother Orson. Later, in Canada, he also brought John Taylor into the fold. George A. Smith, a cousin to the Prophet and grandfather of our President George Albert Smith, and another leader Wilford Woodruff, were also among the early ones to cast their lot with the Latter-day Saints. These stalwarts in the faith performed, with others, valiant service in carrying the restored gospel to our Nation and the world.\nOne thing vitally needed to reinforce the missionaries was convincing literature akin to the Epistles of Paul and others of the long ago. The Book of Mormon provided basic scripture of an impelling interest; the growing Doctrine and Covenants gave living revelation for guidance and inspiration mainly of the membership. Other writings to help expound truth and light to an indifferent or scoffing world, were also essential. Experiences in the field brought Parley P. Pratt to a keen realization of this need; and he set to work with zeal to meet it. As a result, in 1837, he produced his stirring little book, Voice of Warning.\nThis first volume of evangelistic literature by one of the members of our Church not only braced every elder in his work but became a great missionary itself. It was a forceful reply, to begin with, for the scoffers; it met enemies of the Church on their own ground with courage; it portrayed with understanding and eloquence the meaning and message of the restored gospel. In a word, it was and is religious literature of classic quality; it lives and lasts.\nSpace and time do not permit any extended study here of the Voice of Warning. To get something of a mastery of this outstanding work requires reading and rereading, and in the spirit of the time and setting of its creation; but the reward in spiritual uplift and better understanding of our gospel is richly worth the study. From the viewpoint of this course—the appreciation of our literature—there are also inspirational outcomes to be gained from even a hurried perusal of this remarkable book.\nOne is impressed first of all with the author's mastery of the Bible. His keen analysis of the Scriptures marks him as a theologian of high attainment. His portrayal of their truths in relation to the restored gospel is of compelling and convincing character. Added to all this, the author's skill to tell a story, to write clear, straight-to-the-mark composition, to create rhythmic sentences, and to lift his message into the concrete with apt words, give literary quality of high order to his work. His prose is poetic; it lends itself to expressive oral reading.\nJust a few sentences and paragraphs will serve here for illustration:\nOne of the greatest obstacles in the way of the spread of truth is the tide of pub-opinion (The Voice of Warning, \"American Preface,\" XII).\nOpinion and guess-work in the things of God are worse than useless; facts, well demonstrated, can alone be of service to mankind (Ibid., XVI).\nDuring this thousand years Satan will be bound, and have no power to tempt the children of men. And the earth itself will be delivered from the curse which came by reason of the Fall.\n\nThe rough places will become smooth, the barren desert fruitful; the mountains levelled; the valleys exalted; the thorn and thistle shall no more be found, but all the earth shall yield her increase and abundance to constitute any kingdom in heaven or on earth; namely, first, a king; secondly, commissioned officers duly qualified to execute his ordinances and laws; thirdly, a code of laws by which the subjects are governed, and fourthly, subjects who are governed.... In this respect the kingdom of God is like all other kingdoms, whenever we find officers duly commissioned and qualified by the Lord Jesus, together with his ordinances and laws existing in purity, unmixed with any precepts or commandments of men, there the kingdom of God exists, and there His power is manifest, and his blessings are enjoyed as in days of old (Ibid., \"The Kingdom of God,\" pp. 74:75). The Book of Mormon has perhaps been less understood, and more misrepresented, by the world at large than any other publication which has ever appeared (Ibid., \"Origin of the American Indians,\" page 104). Be ye hard-hearted, ye ungodly children of men; your eyes will very soon behold him who was crucified for your sins; then shall ye see that the resurrection of the dead is a reality, something tangible, and that eternity is not a land of shades, nor a world of phantoms, as some suppose (Ibid., \"The Resurrection and Restoration,\" page 166). From this beginning, for which the author gives to God the honor for whatever is praiseworthy in it, and pays tribute also to Joseph Smith for his inspiration and invaluable contributions, our evangelistic literature has continually been enriched through like service from others. Through pen and press we are still getting many worthy contributions to forward the spread of the restored gospel to the ends of the earth. Studies and Activities 1. What is implied by the term evangelistic literature? Cite examples of such literature used to help missionaries today. 2. Compare the various means available today in spreading the gospel with those at the time of Peter and Paul; and also with those when our Church was in its beginnings. 3. What accounts for the striking success of the earlier missionaries, despite limitations, in carrying the restored gospel to our nation and the world? 4. For the teacher: Assign to two members of the class the reading aloud expressively of the following excerpts from The Voice of Warning: a. Prophecy concerning the Savior: \"Prophecy Already Fulfilled,\" chapter 1, beginning page 24 with words \"We will now proceed to show\" and ending page 25 with words \"from the earth.\" b. As to the Book of Mormon: \"Origin of the American Indian,\" beginning page 65 with words, \"The Book of Mormon has\" and ending page 66 with \"Book of Mormon really is.\" Note not only the thought of these selections but the literary qualities of the language—clarity, movement, rhythm, word choice. 5. Be prepared, if time permits, to give other brief excerpts from writings of other early-day missionaries of special merit in proclaiming the gospel, or brief stories of the heroic carrying of the message to the world. See the biographies suggested or other like books for such words or incidents. References Autobiography and Voice of Warning by Parley P. Pratt. These for amplifying story of first missionary work, and beginnings of evangelistic literature for the promotion of this great service. A good history of the Church such as Essentials of Church History, by Joseph Fielding Smith; or Comprehensive History of the Church, by B. H. Roberts, will be of help not only in connection with this lesson, but of others in the course. Biographies such as Brigham Young, the Man and His Work, by Preston Nibley, Wilford Woodruff, by Matthias F. Cowley, and like works on our early leaders will also be helpful for human background in these studies.  LESSON DEPARTMENT 781 Social Science—Latter-day Saint Political Thought Lesson 4—The Declaration of Belief Regarding Governments and Laws in General\" Elder G.

EVAN JENSEN ECTION 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants, \"A Declaration of Belief regarding Governments and Laws in General,\" is the work of Oliver Cowdery, \"the Second Elder\" of the Church in the new dispensation (Progress of Man, page 367). Objective: To study section 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants as the belief of Latter-day Saints in regard to earthly governments and laws in general. The Latter-day Saint doctrine of divine authority to build a real kingdom of God on earth occasioned persecution and conflict. 'The memories of the American revolution of 1776 were still fresh in the American mind, and the American revolution had been a revolt in which the idea of divine authority in secular affairs had been repudiated. The views of the English philosopher, John Locke (1632-1704) had become very popular in the United States. In 1690 Locke had published Two Treatises on Civil Government. The first treatise was an attack on and an utter repudiation of a work written earlier by Robert Filmer, entitled Patriarcha, which contended that God ordained true government with Adam, and that priestly power to rule, or divine authority, had descended from Adam on down to the British monarchy. Devastating this argument in the first treatise, Locke's second treatise contended for popular representative government and the natural rights of man to \"life, liberty, and property.\" Now came along Joseph Smith with a doctrine misunderstood as being similar to the odious one (in the American mind) of Filmer, with the Prophet and the Latter-day Saint Priesthood substituted (in the American mind) for the British monarch of \"divine right.\" Joseph Smith's reconciliation of divine authority to build \"the kingdom\" was subsequently developed in terms of the doctrine of the divinely inspired Constitution. At a special general conference on August 17, 1835, following the approval by those assembled of the revelations to be included in the book of Doctrine and Covenants, Oliver Cowdery read an article written by himself on \"Governments and Laws in General\"... \"which was accepted and adopted and ordered to be printed in said book\" (D. H. C. II, page 247) now known as section 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Why? As the printed book still states, in order \"that our belief with regard to earthly governments and laws in general may not be misinterpreted nor misunderstood...\" Significance of the Declaration The Declaration regarding governments and laws is most significant. In the first place, it occupies an official position in the covenants of the Church, moved, seconded, and adopted in open meeting by the people of the Church themselves, upon the initiative of one of its members.\n\nNot designated as a direct revelation from God, the Declaration recommended itself to the friends and enemies of the Church as a democratic statement of belief which could not be derided as emanating from outside, extramundane sources. But more important, in order \"that our belief with regard to earthly governments and laws in general may not be misinterpreted nor misunderstood,\" the Declaration may be considered the direct ancestor of the very important 12th Article of Faith, which has made it possible for missionaries to preach \"the kingdom\" in foreign countries without being subject to the charge that they were subversive in undermining support by their people of foreign governments: We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law. Can a man divide his allegiance between kingdom-building and divine authority in a gospel embracing \"all truth,\" with citizenship in the American, British, or any other nation? 'This was the problem. And, from the beginning, it was charged that a Latter-day Saint could not remain a good Latter-day Saint and be a loyal citizen at the same time. The \"Declaration of Belief,\" adopted by the voice of the people August 17, 1835, is one of the first and best answers to this question and, as such, presents some of the interesting contributions Latter-day Saint experience has made to political thought. Implicit in the Declaration is the theory that both Church and State were \"instituted of God for the benefit of man.\" When to this is added the doctrine of the inspired Constitution, a unique theory of Church-State relations (suggested in lesson three) is furnished. In general there are two theories of the proper relation of Church and State, typified by two of the great reformers who had to meet the question head-on, Luther and Calvin. In Luther's theory, the Church is subordinate to the State. In Calvin's view, the State should subordinate itself to the Church. American experience, commencing with Roger Williams, has urged the doctrine of separation of Church and State. But when separated, what is their relationship? The Latter-day Saint attitude and experience suggests the answer: their relationship is co-ordinate. Both are responsible, or should be, to God; and both are responsible to the people in building a great world society in which liberty and toleration can prevail. By this means God's kingdom can be built and, although Latter-day Saint doctrine suggests that eventually everyone will acknowledge Christ, yet everyone will have his liberty— even, said Brigham Young, \"to worshipping a red dog.\" In case of conflict between Church and State as they pursue their twin, co-ordinate missions, the 8th section of the Doctrine and Covenants indicates (as does the Declaration) that conflicts should be reconciled by reference to that law \"which is constitutional, supporting that principle of freedom in maintaining rights and privileges...\" This implication of co-ordinate roles and responsibilities for Church and State may be also stated as a broad social, as well as political, theory, deriving from the fundamental \"facts\" of (a) God's existence and (b) man's existence. Thus, all social institutions bear the same responsibility, in Latter-day Saint doctrine, as Church and State—to make a better world and assist in bringing to pass \"the eternal life of man.\" The Declaration, of course, 783 suggests answers to the two fundamental questions of political theory (1) the nature of the State, and (2) the nature of man. The State is limited by the rights of men: We do not believe that human law has a right to interfere in prescribing rules of worship to bind the consciences of men, nor dictate forms for public and private devotion...(D. & C. 98:4). In return for the liberty granted men, and which the good State must respect, men on their part, it is explained: Are bound to sustain and uphold the respective governments in which they reside, while protected in their inherent and inalienable rights by the laws of such governments;... And that all governments have a right to enact such laws as in their own judgments are best calculated to secure the public interest; at the same time, however, holding sacred the freedom of conscience (D. & C. 98:5). This is one of the great documents of human, political experience. Full analysis of the entire Declaration will be made, step by step, point by point, in a series of lessons to follow the present survey. It is a great and significant landmark in the literature of Latter-day Saint political thought and should be read again and again. Its concluding verse (12) has significance for the \"mission of America,\" shared by Church and State, and for world affairs: We believe it just to preach the gospel to the nations of the earth, and warn the righteous to save themselves from the corruption of the world... As starved, cold Europeans in destroyed cities survey their task; as civil strife rages in humanity-filled Asia; as all people survey the chasm between Communist totalitarianism and the chance afforded men to earn temporal salvation by means of God-granted liberty, we may fortify our minds with the political doctrines \"adopted by unanimous vote at a general assembly of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, held at Kirtland, Ohio, August 17, 1835\" (D. & C., 1921 edition, page 250). Questions for Discussion 1. In the early days of the Church it was often claimed that Latter-day Saints believed that civil government was unimportant. Church history on every page disproves this misunderstanding. In this connection, what is the especial significance of the Declaration: of Belief Regarding Governments and Laws in general? The Twelfth Article of Faith? Joseph Smith's teachings concerning the United States Constitution? What experiences can the class suggest as to whether or not Latter-day Saints make good citizens? What are the two general theories of Church-State relations that have had wide acceptance in the western world? If Church and State are in conflict, is a Latter-day Saint required to choose which he should support, or does modern revelation suggest a happier solution? What is that solution? How does Latter-day Saint political theory point an important method whereby any such conflicts may be avoided? Read verses 1 and 12 of the Declaration, separately, to the class. Discuss each in the light of the foregoing lessons.

Smith\n\nAt the October conference of 1868, George A. Smith was sustained as first counselor to President Brigham Young, succeeding Heber C. Kimball. This selection brought to the First Presidency a man of unusual ability who had already proved his worth to the Church, and whose remaining seven years were to be given to supervisory functions in the Church.\n\nGeorge A. Smith was born in Potsdam, New York, on June 26, 1817. He was a son of John Smith and a first cousin of Joseph the Prophet. All of his family were Congregationalists but young George could not see that this form of Christianity agreed with the scriptures, so he remained aloof from all formally organized religious bodies.\n\nAbout 1830 he heard of the Book of Mormon through his uncle, Joseph Smith, Sr., who visited his home. He was convinced that it was of divine origin and two years later, in September 1832, was baptized. Moving to Ohio, he was soon sent out as a missionary and until the exodus to the West, spent much of his time engaged in missionary work, traveling extensively in the eastern part of the United States.\n\nHe faithfully kept a diary and in it is recorded the vast amount of preaching he did. Before 1870 he had delivered 3800 gospel discourses.\n\nAfter the migration into the Great Basin, Elder Smith became an outstanding pioneer leader. He was a robust man of unbounded energy and soon engaged in many activities that were necessary for the establishment of the new Zion. He led the colony that established Parowan in 1851 to establish the iron industry, and assisted in the general settlement of the southern part of the Territory.\n\nHe has appropriately been called the \"Father of the Southern Settlements.\" So affectionately was he regarded in that area that the city of St. George was named in his honor.\n\nPolitically, he served as a territorial delegate to Congress at Washington, D.C., and assisted in forming the Provisional State of Deseret. He was a member of the territorial legislature in every session between 1850 and 1870, with the exception of one year spent in Congress.\n\n786 New Books For Your Library\n\nLATTER-DAY PROPHETS SPEAK� Ludlow $4.00\nCUMORAH'S GOLD BIBLE� McGavin $2.25\nTHESE AMAZING MORMONS� Weston $1.00\nSTORYTELLER'S SCRAPBOOK� Zobell $1.00\nL.D.S.

Smith departed this life, the vacancy in the Presidency was filled by John W. Young, a son of Brigham Young.\n\nThis young man was born at Nauvoo in 1844 and was ordained an apostle by his father in 1864, but never became a member of the Council of the Twelve. He was interested in industrial pursuits, particularly in the construction and maintenance of railroads which in this era were beginning to enter the West.\n\nIn 1866 the plans for a railroad to the Pacific, with its possible arterial branches serving the intermountain territory, made it apparent that a new era was about to dawn upon the Church that would end the saints' economic, religious, and social isolation. The Church leaders planned branch roads to serve the various settlements, and were in need of competent advice.\n\nBrigham Young chose his son John as a special counselor to him in this capacity in the late sixties, and in 1875 set him apart as his first counselor. He functioned in this capacity until his father's death in August 1877, after which for several years he was sustained as a counselor to the Twelve Apostles.\n\nHe later moved to New York City where he engaged in railroad management.\n\nWillard Richards\n\nAs Brigham Young was assisted by three first counselors during his administration, he similarly had the assistance of three second counselors. The first of these was Willard Richards, who was born in Massachusetts on June 24, 1804. His family were Congregationalists but Willard never formally joined any church.\n\nHe became a successful practicing physician and in the summer of 1835 saw a copy of the Book of Mormon which Brigham Young had left with his cousin near Boston. Willard read a portion of it and declared, \"God or the devil has had a hand in that book, for man never wrote it.\"\n\nHe journeyed to Kirtland the next year and, in December 1836, was baptized. He accompanied Heber C. Kimball to open the British Mission in 1837 and remained there as one of its presidency until 1841, having the unique distinction of having been ordained an apostle in England in 1840.\n\nAt Nauvoo he was one of the outstanding men in its public life, holding the office of temple recorder, clerk of the Church, private secretary to Joseph Smith, clerk of the town council and clerk of the municipal court. He was with the Prophet in Carthage Jail when he was martyred.\n\nBrigham Young chose him as his second counselor in December, 1847 and in that capacity he became the member of the Presidency who assumed much of the clerical and financial phases of Church administration. It was a great change from the calling of a New England physician to the duties he assumed in Salt Lake City. He was Secretary of State in the Provisional State of Deseret; a member of the territorial legislature; postmaster of Salt Lake City; manager of the Perpetual Emigration Fund Company; general Church Historian; and proprietor and editor of the Deseret News, the first newspaper in the intermountain area, which he established in 1850. His premature death in 1854 brought to a close a career that had.\n\n787 ESPECIALLY SUITABLE FOR RELIEF SOCIETY CHORUSES\n301 Bethlehem—Bower-Stickles\n3063 A Christmas Folksong—Reese-Rishel\n15 731 Each Christmas Night—Swift\n9670 Gentle Mary—McFeeters\n16 534 Jingle Bells—Samuelson\nAS 849 Let Our Gladness Know No End—2537\nO Holy Night—Adam-Strickling\n16 688 Silent Night and Adeste Fideles—Swift\nAS 2-H3016 Shepherds in the Hush of Night—O'Hara-Stickles (2546)\nSleep of the Infant Jesus—Christy\n\nCHRISTMAS CANTATAS\nThe Heavenly Child—Hamblen\nThe Music of Bethlehem—Shannon-Holton\nPrepare Him Room—Hadler\n\nPrices include postage.

Grant.\n\nThe man whom Brigham Young selected to succeed Willard Richards was Jedediah M. Grant, a man very unlike his predecessor in office. Fi. Der Grant was born in Windsor, New York, February 21, 1816, and had joined the Church in 1833. During his early years in the Church he spent most of his time in missionary work and gained a reputation as a great gospel preacher and an unusually able scriptorian. He it was who opened the Southern States Mission of the Church.\n\nIn October 1847, he arrived in Salt Lake Valley. When the city was incorporated he was elected its first mayor, which position he continued to hold until his death. He was also a member of the territorial legislature. At the April conference in 1854, he was ordained an apostle and sustained as the second counselor to Brigham Young. For the next two and a half years his energies were spent in promoting what is commonly called \"The Reformation.\" The saints had become so engrossed in their struggle to wrest their sustenance from the parched earth that some had seemed to forget that it was their religion that had been the cause of their going into the West. President Grant literally wore himself out physically, through his strenuous efforts to get the people to see the vital values in life. As a result of his efforts, there was a universal revival of spiritual life and energy, such as the saints had never before witnessed in the Church.\n\nThis calling of the people to repentance had a lasting effect upon the Church membership and resulted in a renewed interest in missionary work to the nations of the world. His early death—forty years of age—probably resulted from overwork in this cause. Coupled with his vigor and uncompromising battle against slothfulness and \"backsliding\" as he termed it, Jedediah M. Grant had a compassion for all who suffered. He died at Salt Lake City on December 1, 1856, nine days after the birth of his son, Heber J. Grant, who became the seventh President of the Church.\n\nDaniel Hanmer Wells The third of Brigham Young's second counselors, was Daniel Hanmer Wells, who was born in Trenton, New York, October 27, 1814. In 1833 he had moved to Commerce (later Nauvoo), where he was a large landholder and prominent in civic affairs. He dealt kindly with the saints who had been driven from Missouri, and although not a member of the Church, was treated as one of their number and was elected to the office of town councilman and appointed a brigadier-general in the Nauvoo Legion. When the saints were forced to leave Nauvoo he decided to cast his lot with them, although had he remained he undoubtedly would have become wealthy from the spoils of their labors. His baptism took place in Nauvoo in 1846. He arrived in Utah in 1848.\n\nThere he became active in the territorial militia, taking part in the campaigns against the Indians with marked success, and carrying to a successful conclusion the \"bloodless war\" with Johnston's Army in 1857 and 1858. On being ordained an apostle and set apart as second counselor to Brigham Young, January 4, 1857, he took over the supervision of public works, an essential portion of the economy of the Church, which provided employment for the immigrants during the adjustment period between their arrival in the Valley and the beginning of their agricultural or manufacturing pursuits. He likewise visited the many settlements of the saints and in 1876 visited the newly founded colonies of saints in Arizona, giving them counsel and inspirational advice.\n\nThe death of Brigham Young released him from his office, but he was sustained as a counselor to the Twelve Apostles. In this capacity he served as president of the European Missions and ended his days as president of the Manti temple. He died March 24, 1891.\n\nTopics for Discussion 1.\n\nWhat evidence can you present to show that God inspired Brigham Young to choose his counselors because the Church had need for the talents they possessed? \n\n2.

Pickering, General Secretary-Treasurer\n\nTHE annual general Relief Society conference for 1948 was held Wednesday and Thursday, September 29 and 30, at Salt Lake City, Utah, with President Belle S. Spafford presiding. A historic feature of the 1948 conference was the announcement at the Thursday morning session in the Tabernacle of the successful completion of fund-raising for a Relief Society building. The conference opened Wednesday morning with an officers meeting in the Assembly Hall which was almost filled to capacity with stake and mission officers. Elder G. Homer Durham, speaking in place of Elder Mark E. Petersen who was unable to attend, gave an address on \"Home, the Cradle of Liberty.\" The annual report and official instructions were presented by President Belle S. Spafford. Margaret F. Richards, President of the Stadium Village Relief Society, Emigration Stake, spoke on \"A Young Mother Discovers Relief Society,\" and Secretary Pickering discussed \"Stake Board Functions.\" Roll call showed 171 stakes and 19 missions reporting, Oahu being the only stake unrepresented. All mission Relief Society presidents from the United States, Canada, and Mexico, who had been specially invited by the First Presidency to attend the conference, were present. Wednesday Page 802 afternoon, departmental meetings, all well attended, were held from 1:00 to 2:00 P.M. For the welfare, Magazine, and secretary-treasurers departments, and from 2:15 to 3:15 p.m.\n\nFor the educational, work, and music departments. In the evening the annual reception for visiting stake and mission officers was held in the Lafayette Ballroom at the Hotel Utah. Preceding the reception a formal presentation was held at which gifts for the new building were presented to the general board. An oil landscape painted by Samuel Jepperson, a pioneer artist, was presented by Utah Stake Relief Society; a woven tag throw rug by the Marsh Center Ward, Portneuf Stake; a handcrocheted set of tidies made and presented as a personal gift by Lavaughn Fowler, president of the Inkom Ward Relief Society, Pocatello Stake. The gifts were displayed during the reception.\n\nThe general session in the Tabernacle Thursday morning was devoted to recognition of the Building Fund achievement and was conducted by Counselor Marianne C., Sharp, chairman of the Building Fund committee. A recorded dramatization, \"The Symbol of a Dream,\" written by Verda Mae Fuller, under direction of Mary G. Judd, gave the historical highlights of The ANNUAL GENERAL RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE long-cherished desire of Relief Society women for a building. A portion of the dramatization consisted of reproductions of the voices of early leaders and Bishop Marvin O. Ashton, and the actual voices of President George Albert Smith, President Spafford, and Counselor Sharp. This was recorded before the meeting and broadcast into the Tabernacle during the meeting.\n\nA large replica of the building was placed across the center section of the organ. Windows in the replica were made to light up, one by one, as each group of stakes was given recognition, and the door was illuminated when the missions were recognized. This part of the program was entitled \"From the Shadow of a Dream to the Sunlight of Promise,\" and was written by Vesta P. Crawford under the direction of Priscilla L. Evans and read by Sister Evans.\n\nPresident Belle S. Spafford, addressing the meeting on \"Joy In Full Measure,\" expressed gratitude to the women of the Church that, through their untiring efforts and devotion, the goal had been reached in one year. In an address entitled \"And What of the Promise?\" Counselor Marianne C. Sharp summarized the Building Fund project and reported the receipt of $554,016 to date. Bishop LeGrand Richards commended the organization for its support of Church activities in 1933 and congratulated it on achieving the Building Fund quota.\n\nThe general session Thursday afternoon was conducted by President Spafford and featured an address by President George Albert Smith, in which he called attention to the unique place in the world held by Relief Society and complimented the women on their devotion to the cause they serve. Counselor Velma N. Simonsen spoke on \"Our Responsibility to Inactive Members,\" and Blanche B. Stoddard on \"A Measuring Rod for Growth.\" The conference was concluded with an address by President Spafford.\n\nMusic for the sessions on Thursday was furnished by a combined chorus of 450 Singing Mothers from the stakes of the Salt Lake region, directed by Florence J. Madsen, with Elder Frank W. Asper at the organ. A special feature of the music program Thursday morning was the rendition by the chorus of \"Build, Thou, for Life's Immortal Goal,\" composed specially for the occasion by Sister Madsen. This Singing Mothers chorus, which sang at both Thursday sessions, also sang the following day at the first two sessions of the semi-annual general conference of the Church.\n\nAt the Wednesday morning officers meeting, Dorothy Kimball Keddington sang \"The Flag Without a Stain,\" and Beverly B. Glauser played appropriate prelude and postlude numbers on the organ.\n\nThe conference addresses \"Joy in Full Measure,\" by President Belle S. Spafford and \"And What of the Promise?\" by Counselor Marianne C. Sharp were published in the November issue of the Magazine, and President Smith's address \"Living to Enjoy the Blessings of the Lord\" is featured in this issue.\n\n\"Lean Your Ear This Way\"\n\nIris W. Schow\n\nADELE Marlowe was not conscious of it, as she hurried purposefully from the elevator to the street, but the mechanically distorted Christmas carol, the fat, gleaming bows hanging from the holly wreaths, and the jostlings of the shoppers were all in harmony with her mood of overwhelming exultation and well-being. The air was less crisp than it had been when she went in, and a few large snowflakes were descending reluctantly. A newly changed record blared out discordantly from the loudspeaker above the First Bank. It was softened abruptly, so that the chimes fell on the ear gently and separately, Adele thought, as if an angel picked out the tune with one finger, note by note, on little silver bells.\n\n\"Adeste Fideles\" this was as far as she could get without the aid of English— \"joyful and triumphant.\"\n\n\"Joyful and triumphant,\" that was it precisely. For, now that Dr. Copeland had assured her that she was justified in harboring her wonderful hope, she would hurry to tell Roy about it. She would go right into Freem's and interrupt him at his work, even if it wasn't a critical emergency. After all, she never had gone into the store to see Roy, although he had worked there for almost two months. Roy didn't believe in mixing domesticity with business. That wasn't the way to get ahead. Well, neither did she, but this was different. She was so keyed up that she couldn't go home and wait until he came out on the seven-thirty bus. That would take too long. Merely walking to Freem's was taking almost too long.\n\nThe glow in Adele's eyes, coupled with the suggestion of a smile that lifted the corners of her generous mouth, compelled answering smiles from the women she passed. A soprano's recorded singing filled the streets now, and the words seeped into Adele's consciousness: The hopes and fears of all the years Are met in thee to-night....\n\nHOW they had hoped for a really good position for Roy, during these early years of their marriage! It had come at last—assistant manager at Freem's, exactly the opening he had wanted ever since he had finished college, the very position where his excellent training in business would assure his advancement, and the murmur in his heart would hinder him as little as possible. And now their other hope, dearer still....\n\nA school group had begun singing over the speaking system: Ho! Ho! Hol! Who wouldn't go? Who wouldn't go, indeed?\n\nThe gleam in Adele's eyes softened. In six years from now—no, seven—what sort of little lad or girl might be up there caroling with the others? This day really was too wonderful!\n\nAdele pulled open the door and entered Freem's Department Store. She would ask the first clerk she saw where to find Mr. Marlowe. \"LEAN Your EAR THIS WAY\"\n\nAnyone who worked there would know the new assistant manager.\n\nThe department store Santa had paused in his descent of the broad stairway to wave to the small girl and boy who bounced expectantly at the foot, flanked by a pair of amused parents.\n\nAs she approached, Adele watched Santa Claus wave exaggeratedly, then descend slowly. He created a grand illusion of genuine old age when he eased himself down on a lower step and seated a child on each knee. The girl's great blue eyes and small white teeth sparkled vivaciously, while domestic prattle about \"a real little stove and some very tiny kettles and pans\" rushed from her lips. The little boy waited gravely, as becomes an oldish child, but his dark eyes burned with an eagerness which his silence could not discount. Just so, in three or four years, Adele's child would pour out its impatient hopes. That would be a special moment for her, for the child, and even for Santa, no doubt; for then Roy might even be the manager. Adele pictured herself, really tastefully turned out, indulgently hovering close by, admired and idealized by every employee in the store.\n\nShe almost sprinted up the stairs, moved briskly through the latest in \"Everything to Beautify the Home,\" and arrived at the little office window, breathing rapidly.\n\"I'd like to speak to Mr. Roy Marlowe,\" she told the girl who appeared at the window.\n\"I'm sorry,\" said the girl, in the tone and manner of a telephone operator giving one the time of day. \"Mr. Marlowe is no longer with us.\"\nAdele turned away. The great thing was not to show how much and intimately it mattered, to look as if she might be Roy's second cousin's sister-in-law from Washington County, dropping in to say, \"Hello.\"\n\nHow long had Roy been \"no longer with them\" at Freen's? Why? Where was he spending the time from nine A.M. until six-thirty P.M. each day? If he had quit his job to accept a better one, he would have told her. What was he doing right now? Hunting desperately for another good job, she supposed.\n\nShe was back downstairs now, approaching the door. There sat Santa Claus still in the great armchair, chuckling and nodding, while another pair of doting parents heard their little dove make her Christmas requests. What a spectacle for a grown man to have to make of himself in order to gain a livelihood!\n\n\"And a dollie, and a dollie bed, and a buggy . . .\" That blue-eyed little girl on his lap was enumerating everything she had ever seen or heard of.\nAdele hastened on toward the door. There would be some relief in getting outside again, in spite of the falling snow, if only the crowd didn't mill about so. She must get herself in hand. Even though she had just been toppled over by a stunning blow, she reminded herself there was no excuse for lashing out at the whole human scene, including Santa Claus and innocent childhood.\n\nAlthough she had not exactly decided to go there, Adele was hurrying toward the employment agency. It was not the loss of Roy's position that was so upsetting. It was not knowing what Roy was going through, how he was spending his days, and how long or deeply he had been worrying. She had been too busy with her own hopes lately, or he never could have kept up a bluff before her. Not with that frank, trustworthy expression of his!\n\nWaiting for the traffic light to change, Adele brushed diligently at the film of snow on the shoulders of her trim brown coat, unmindful that she still had nearly a block to go. Well, one thing was certain, she decided. It was not through any fault of his own that Roy had lost that job. He always got along well with others. Why, his air of willingness to please was the first striking characteristic that she had noticed about him. It was almost as obvious as his busy way of smoothing back his hair with one hand, in an attempt to appear at ease, whenever he felt self-conscious.\n\nThe corners of Adele's mouth curved upward momentarily, as she moved forward with the stream of pedestrians. Activity was at a surprisingly low ebb at the employment agency. Adele had the almost instantaneous attention of a shrewdly efficient young woman, who asked crisply, \"May I help you?\"\n\n\"Want—that is, I came to—I was just looking for someone, thank you.\"\n\nAdele turned and left swiftly. Whatever had she gone blundering in there for? She certainly didn't intend to rush from place to place inquiring about her husband, as if she were hounding him down. That could only serve to make them both appear ridiculous. The best thing she could do was to go quietly home. She started for the bus stop at the corner.\n\nShould she let Roy know how she had learned that he was no longer at Freem's, or should she wait until he told her? Should she tell him about the baby now? Probably not. It would only add to his burdens—make everything harder for him, and he must be nearly wild with worry now. But wouldn't he be able to tell that she knew about the job, the minute he saw her face?\n\nWere they going to keep that nerve-jangling music grinding out all day? \"Silent Night...\"\n\nIf only there could be a little silence, maybe she could think at least one of her problems through to a sensible conclusion. No wonder she had dashed into the employment agency without any idea of what to do when she got there.\n\nDele could see her bus approaching when she remembered the satin comforters she had on lay-away at Stewart's for Mom and Mother Marlowe. Whatever had made her pay a deposit on anything so expensive? The minute she felt a little affluent, there she went! Well, she must get over to Stewart's right now and see if she could talk that elderly Mrs. Lee, the saleswoman who seemed to like her, into letting her apply the 'deposit on some other purchases. Lace vanity sets would make nice Christmas gifts for their mothers, and she would be needing a lot of small things for the baby. By adding a little more money to the deposit, she could take care of Christmas and make a real start on her layette. That was, she could if they were understanding about the deposit.\n\nIt was dear and considerate of Roy to spare her the worry about his job. But actually it wasn't fair to let her run the risk of sticking out her neck even farther in the latter of paying deposits on nonessentials. Adele's limbs went sickeningly weak at the thought of how near she had come to really splurging with a down payment on the beautiful combination radio-phonograph which she knew that Roy longed to possess. What luck that she had happened to decide to think it over a little longer!\n\nWell, the pressing need was to plan exactly what to say to make that nice little Mrs. Lee understand about the deposit. She mustn't let herself in for any more incoherent floundering. To plan ahead was what brought real results. But where was Roy spending his days? If only there were some way of knowing....\n\nShe was getting so tired. Carol after carol had beaten upon her ears. Two women approached, arm in arm, while they spoke into each other's faces. \"But Aunt Millie serves so much good home cooking, I'd say a nice little pickle fork would dispose of her.\" They bumped Adele from their path without a glance or a break in their conversation. They didn't even need any nice little fork to dispose of me, thought Adele, struggling to maintain her footing. Though she had barely bypassed the entrance to Stewart's, she had to force her way back against the current of pedestrians.\n\nONCE indoors, Adele paused before the first mirror she noticed. A check-up on her appearance certainly must precede any attempt to undo her error in judgment, she decided. There was still something trim about her brown coat, considering that this was its second season. Just a little matter of brushing off a bit of snow, straightening her hat, tucking back a tendril of hair, and placing a judicious dash of powder, and she would look appealing enough. That is, she would if she could suppress that worried expression.\n\nStewart's evidently provided their own musical atmosphere. Somewhere a phonograph with a rather good tone was playing \"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town.\" \"Better not pout,\" thought Adele, starting for the elevators. She'd wait for one, if she had to. Even one flight of stairs seemed too much of a climb for her now.\n\nTwo small boys were talking with Santa this time. Poor little fellows, undoubtedly they had no suspicion of it, but this was probably the last heart-to-heart chat they would ever hold with a department store St. Nick, Adele decided from their large size. She paused to watch, lips parted with faintly smiling interest.\n\nHip boots for wading, of all things! A pity they didn't have their parents in tow; still, important matters had a way of getting into every conversation, in a home....\n\nAnd suddenly Adele saw that Santa, giving a start, had laid a (Continued on page 832)\n\nLeft to right: Effie Yates; Mary Stevenson; Mayna Mathews; Fannie B. Terry\n\"Happy Grandmothers\" Enjoy An Entertaining Hobby\n\nTWENTY years ago Mary Stevenson, now the chorister in LeGrand Ward (Salt Lake City) Relief Society, found a unique way to bring cheer and happiness to people who were ill or homebound. Being a skillful player of the mandolin and harmonica, she decided to organize a \"good cheer\" group, which included from the very first Fannie Terry and Mayna Mathews. Six years ago Effie Yates was asked to join the group. The other member, Alfhild Mork, a Norwegian convert to the Church, who plays the guitar, whistles, and yodels, was not present when the above photograph was taken.\n\nAt first the group took their high-hearted music into individual homes, playing for birthdays, weddings, and other special occasions, but their unusual entertainment became so much in demand that they have played in hundreds of Latter-day Saint wards, in many other churches, over several radio stations, and they have received numerous requests for performances in every state of the Union. Their contribution to Utah's Centennial celebration was outstanding and every governor present at the 1947 convention invited the \"Happy Grandmothers\" to visit his state.\n\nTheir repertoire includes gay dances, the schottische, varsovienna, polka music, and many European and American folk songs and dances. The women wear authentic costumes which are copies of pioneer gowns and bonnets of a hundred years ago.\n\nEach of these musicians has made a unique contribution. Fanny Terry bought her first guitar forty-five years ago while her husband was on a mission. When her son, Captain Elmer Terry, left for the Second World War, he asked the musical grandmothers to keep his mother playing until he returned. Captain Terry never returned, but his mother is still playing and making people happy. She is now seventy-six years old.\n\nMayna Mathews is an expert nurse who has played the guitar and harmonica for many years. Effie Yates was past fifty years old before she took a music lesson. She now plays the guitar and harmonica.\n\nAll of these women have been active in Relief Society work for many years. Sister Terry and Sister Mathews are visiting teachers and Sister Yates is first counselor in Emigration Stake Relief Society.\n\nThen Came Christmas\n\nGrace A. Woodbury\n\nABBIE Walker stood in the doorway of her small adobe home and looked with a disgruntled expression at the sunny landscape before her. To the south, at the foot of a brownish-gray, low-lying hill, ran the Virgin River, gleaming like a broad silver ribbon in the sunshine. To the west rose the Black Ridge, with its scanty covering of creosote bushes whose dingy green only slightly relieved the glistening black of its lava covering. This ridge ended in a point at the northwest of the valley where it almost rubbed noses with the point of the Red Hill, so called because of its red sandstone formation.\n\nThis hill seemed to diffuse a glow that made the valley warm, even though it was just a week until Christmas. Generally Abbie appreciated the kindly warmth, but today it struck her as being out of place in a season that should be cold and sparkling with snow. Frankly, she told herself, she was homesick—tired of the whole Dixie mission, its scanty food, brackish water, and alkali soil. Why had they been called way down here just as they were getting comfortably settled in Salt Lake City? Even there she had been homesick for her old home on the wave-washed coast of Nova Scotia—hungry for the sound of the waves and for a view of those mountains whose snowy covering brought the pines and firs into beautiful relief.\n\nBut in the years that she lived in Salt Lake City, she had learned to love the beautiful Wasatch Mountains, ever changing their color with the seasons. Under their protecting watchfulness she had grown to womanhood, had found her mate, and a few years later been married to him. Together they planted fruit trees, shrubs, and flowers around their little home and then when the fruit trees were ready to yield their first and much longed-for harvest, had come the call to go to the Dixie mission.\n\nFor a few days it had seemed to Abbie and her husband Charles that the very foundation of their little world was shattered. But they were pioneers in the strictest sense of the word, so again with eyes and hearts hopefully turned toward the future, they sold their home for a wagon and team, packed up their remaining possessions, including their two little boys Charley and Joe, and once more took leave of friends and home.\n\nAbbie had thought that in Salt Lake they had known hardship and want, but today as she looked back over the years they had spent in Dixie, she wondered how she could ever have thought such a thing. For it was just a week until Christmas and not a cent of money in the house to buy such needed things as shoes and hats, and Christmas presents were out of the question.\n\nAbbie had never been one to complain and tears came rarely to her brave, clear-visioned eyes. Even Mother Nature, she thought bitterly, refused to adorn these barren hills with beautifying trees and shrubs—Page 809—and also failed to clothe their winter nakedness with charitable snow. Well, she knew that in far-off Nova Scotia and dear Salt Lake City the snowflakes were making of the mountains and valleys a fitting and purified setting for the celebration of the birthday of him whose life would always be a symbol of purity and cleanliness.\n\nTHEN the tears, unbidden, rushed to her eyes, blinding her for the minute so that she did not know that her husband was near until he spoke to her. \"Why, Abbie, dear, what can be the matter, has anything happened to you or the children? Have you had bad news?\"\n\n\"No, Charles,\" she replied, \"nothing has happened, but I am homesick for a real snowy Christmas like we used to have back home in Salt Lake. I know it seems foolish but it just doesn't seem like Christmas. Just look, the grass is green along the ditch bank and the blackbirds sing as if it were spring.\"\n\n\"And a mighty lucky thing it is for us to have it mild like this,\" answered Charles. \"Fancy me wading around in the snow and mud in shoes like these,\" he added, showing shoes much the worse for wear. \"Yours aren't any better and I noticed this morning that the children's shoes won't last much longer either.\"\n\n\"That's another thing I was feeling bad about when you came,\" said Abbie. \"I hate to send the children to Sunday School. I just can't bear to have them go so shabby. If we could only have some new clothes and shoes for Christmas I wouldn't ask for anything else.\"\n\n\"I'm so sorry, Abbie. I thought I was doing so well,\" said Charles, for the blacksmithing I have done for the neighbors, but Gus wanted me to take some beef on his bill and Henry wanted to pay molasses on his, so of course I took it and glad to get it too, even though we could make good use of a little cash. But cheer up, dear, something's bound to come our way. You know we have never been without some kind of shoes and clothing and I think we never shall.\"\n\n\"Don't you ever get homesick for England, Charles? You always seem so cheerful that I often wonder at the encouragement you find with our hard lot here in Dixie.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I do sometimes, Abbie. In our hot, dry, merciless summers, my eyes fairly ache for a sight of the grass-covered hills of England, its dewy meadows and hedgerows. Then again I feel like I can never be happy until I once more hear a nightingale singing in the moonlight. But when winter comes and I think of the English fog and the gray, damp, sunless days, I am glad to be in dry, sunny Dixie, where the white plague that haunts England is not known. So you see, dear, every loss has some compensation, and if we haven't good shoes we have good stockings, thanks to your busy fingers.\"\n\nThat evening Abbie took down her workbox from a high shelf. The box had been her mother's and one of Joe's very few household treasures she had brought from her old home. Her mother had died on the plains of cholera, so it wasn't any wonder that Abbie prized the box above her other possessions and kept it out of the children's reach. But tonight she was so busy setting up a red mitten that was part of Joe's Christmas that she did not notice that little Charley was rummaging in the workbox until he called, \"Mother, look, what made this little straight crack in the end of your workbox?\"\n\nNOT getting an immediate reply, he stuck an inquiring fingernail into the crack. The crack widened a little. Again he pried and could see that the whole end could be raised about an inch above the level of the box. Just then his mother turned to investigate his silence and saw what had happened. With a cry she picked up the workbox.\n\n\"Oh, Charley, you have broken my box. How ever did you do it?\" She started toward her husband with it, saying, \"Just look, Charles, the boy has broken my mother's workbox. Do you think that you could mend it?\"\n\nIn handing it to him the box tipped, and before their astonished eyes, out fell—no, not buttons nor thread, but five sovereigns!\n\n\"Well, bless my soul,\" exclaimed Charles, \"where did they come from, five sovereigns, worth five dollars apiece?\"\n\n\"Out of the box somewhere,\" said Abbie excitedly, \"but just where is a mystery to me.\"\n\nCharles took the box, examined it a minute or two, then cried out, \"Look here, Abbie, the mystery is solved. The box has a double bottom and the end is made so that it can be pulled up. The small slit in the end of the box was put there to use just as Charley used it to pull up the end so that valuables or money could be hidden in the space between the false and real bottoms of the box. This dry Dixie climate has warped the box so that this small crack opened the secret door, visible to Charley's sharp eyes, thank goodness!\"\n\n\"Thank goodness! Was ever money more welcome! Now we can all have new shoes for Christmas, and maybe something else besides,\" said Abbie joyfully. \"And it's going to seem like Christmas after all!\"\n\nPresently, Charles, who had been looking thoughtfully at the box, asked, \"Abbie, what do you know about the history of this workbox?\"\n\n\"Only this,\" replied Abbie, \"my aunt gave it to my mother years ago when she was just a girl back in Nova Scotia. When mother died on the plains coming to the Valley, my aunt asked father to let her have the box as a keepsake. Father gave it to her and she kept it until she died a year or two after we came to Dixie, then Uncle Robert gave it to me. But how and when the money was put in there I haven't the slightest idea.\"\n\n\"It would be interesting to know about the money got into the box,\" said Charles, \"but not nearly so interesting as the fact that it got out.\"\n\nA week later Abbie Walker again stood in the doorway of her small adobe home, her husband Charles beside her. Together they looked over the sunny landscape before them. It was Christmas morning and there was a frosty tang in the air, but the sun shone from a sky as clear and blue as spring. The children, happy in new shoes and mittens, and the proud possessors of china mugs filled with \"store\" candy, were playing in the yard. Abbie watched them, smiling happily. Presently she looked up at her husband and said, \"My, I'm glad it isn't snowing.\"\n\nIt would just ruin my shoes!\" Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, December 1 and December 15, 1888 \"For THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ZION AND THE RIGHTS OF THE Women oF All Nations\" CHRISTMAS: Ah, me!

Bowen of the Council of the Twelve, and granddaughter of President Brigham Young, was signally honored by the citizens of Utah and outstanding musical friends when more than 2,500 music lovers gathered at a testimonial in the Assembly Hall, Temple Square, October 25, 1948. A specially selected chorus and forty members of the Utah Symphony opened the program with Bach's \"Magnificat,\" the work in which Mrs. Bowen made her debut in Berlin in 1900. It was the audience itself which \"commanded\" the once great star of European and American concert and opera stages to close the testimonial with the singing of the role of Violetta in the \"disintegration\" scene from the third act of Verdi's \"La Traviata\" which had just been presented as closing selection with many former students of Mrs. Bowen signing as soloists and members of the chorus. An appreciative and well-earned tribute which touched the hearts of the audience was paid Mrs. Bowen by her accomplished friend Becky Almond. The response by Mrs. Bowen was in perfect taste. The entire proceeds of the testimonial were given to the Utah Building Fund.\n\nIN St. George, Utah, a drugstore is owned and operated entirely by women.\n\nJUST off the press is a book of poems, beautifully bound in maroon and gold, titled Wayside Whispering.

Christmas is truly a time for considering the stars and all the \"handywork\" of God.\n\nFor centuries the stars have been to the earthbound a symbol of that which endures in beauty and serenity. Today, in the midst of much tumult, in the confusion and conflict of ideas and ideologies, we turn with a spiritual yearning to that which seems steadfast, to eternal patterns, and to everlasting law.\n\nMany travelers have observed that the stars which are visible in the Holy Land seem more beautiful than those in any other place in all the world. This may, perhaps, be explained by the fact that Palestine is largely desert country, rifted by mountains and cut by gullies. And in contrast to this wilderness which is the land, the stars shine with utmost brilliance and they seem to be very near to earth.\n\nAbove the hills of the East appeared the new star, a fulfillment of prophecy, a guide, and a beacon. The Magi followed that star with implicit faith akin to that high spiritual dedication with which many in succeeding ages have followed the gospel of which the star was a symbol. And many have thought of the message that Jesus brought to the earth as being like unto the stars in its steadfast shining.\n\nIt has been said that the heavens are an open book in which the stars are golden letters. Yet there is much that men, without revelation, cannot understand. For in the star is written the story of how the worlds were made and set in place. The Prophet Joseph Smith has told us that:\nThe earth rolls upon her wings, and the sun giveth his light by day, and the moon giveth her light by night, and the stars also give their light, as they roll upon their wings in their glory, in the midst of the power of God.\n\nUnto what shall I liken these kingdoms, that ye may understand them? Behold, all these are kingdoms, and any man who has seen any or the least of these hath seen God moving in his majesty and power (D&C 88:45-47).\nIn this time and in this place may we be comforted by the symbol of eternal patterns which the stars reveal, and let us rest assured that more knowledge will be given us in that time and place which God has set for our knowing.\nIs not God in the height of heaven? And behold the height of the stars, how high they are! And thou sayest, How doth God know? Can he judge through the dark clouds? Thick clouds are a covering to him . . . and he walketh in the circuit of heaven (Job 22:12-14).\nV. P. C.\nPage 814\nPriscilla L. Evans and Florence G. Smith Released from the General Board\n\nIt is with keen regret and with an appreciation for the fine work done by Priscilla L. Evans and Florence G. Smith on the general board of Relief Society, that the general board has accepted the requests made by these sisters that they be released. Sister Evans' resignation became effective as of October 15, 1948, and Sister Smith's on October 20, 1948.\n\nSister Evans was appointed to the general board in June 1941 during the administration of President Amy Brown Lyman. She came endowed with unusual creative ability and was qualified by training to give outstanding service in matters pertaining to legal questions. From her previous position as mission Relief Society president of the Eastern States Mission she also brought to her position an understanding of Relief Society work, with particular insight into the needs and requirements of mission Relief Societies. She has fulfilled the manifold requirements devolving upon her as a member of the general board with distinction. Sister Evans will be long remembered as the creator and writer of the March 1947 Sunday night Radio Society program \"A Story in Granite and Bronze,\" as well as for her co-operation in writing and impressive delivery of \"From the Shadow of a Dream to the Sunlight of Promise\" which recognized the stakes and missions in the Building Fund Program at the recent annual general Relief Society conference. She has also served Relief Society members and friends and recognition for herself and the organization during the past nine years through holding the position of corresponding secretary of the National Council of Women.\n\nWhile Sister Evans has found it advisable to be relieved of the pressing and exacting duties of general board work, she will no doubt continue to give freely of her great ability and talents, as she may be called upon, both to her Church and State to which she has always been so generous in rendering outstanding service in the past.\n\nSISTER Florence G. Smith was called to the general board in November 1946 during the administration of President Belle S. Spafford. She brought to her general board duties an understanding of Relief Society work growing out of many years' experience in presiding over the Relief Societies of the South African, California, and Northwestern States Missions. This service has made Sister Smith very cognizant of the differing conditions under which Relief Society functions in various parts of the world. In carrying out her general board assignment, she has manifested a willingness to serve and an appreciation of the opportunity to serve, coupled with a gentleness of spirit and a love for the women of the Church. Her services will remain to bless Relief Society.\n\nShe has now been called to serve as matron of the Bee Hive House for young women, an appointment which will be quite exacting but to which she will bring her wholehearted attention and splendid gifts of graciousness.\n\nPage 815\n\nIn Memoriam�Alice Merrill Horne\n\nALICE MERRILL HORNE, beloved member of the Relief Society general board (1902-1916), passed away October 7, 1948, at the age of eighty. Through her mother Bathsheba Smith Merrill, Sister Horne was a granddaughter of George A. Smith (cousin of the Prophet Joseph and First Counselor to President Brigham Young) and Bathsheba W. Smith, a beautiful and gracious woman, fourth general president of Relief Society. President George Albert Smith is a cousin of Alice Merrill Horne.\n\nSister Horne was also blessed with a rich spiritual and intellectual heritage from her father, Clarence Merrill. Alice Merrill, wife of George W. Horne, was richly endowed with beauty and strength of mind and personality. Whatever her capable hands touched blossomed with enduring symmetry. She served her State as an active member of the Legislature and in numerous other positions of civic trust and responsibility.\n\nSister Horne's work on the general board covered a wide range of activities, including the chairmanship of the Public Health Committee which established a series of sanitary milk stations in Salt Lake City and accomplished many other reforms vital to the welfare of mothers and children. She traveled widely as a representative of Relief Society, attending the International Council of Women in Berlin in 1904 and the meetings of the National Council of Women in 1902 and 1909, the Worlds Fair in 1915, and many other meetings of importance.\n\nIn the field of art, Sister Horne rendered invaluable service. She made many beautiful designs for Relief Society programs, bulletins, and other publications. A series of lessons which she prepared was published under the title Devotees and Their Shrines, a Handbook of Utah Art (1914). The book was adopted as a text in the schools of Utah and has been widely read, still maintaining its place as a most inspiring reference book. The preface, a masterpiece in prose, expresses Sister Horne's life-long philosophy of accomplishment: \"Every spirit which enters mortality comes stamped with infinity�with a power to reach out and grow illimitably.... Listen to the infinite of your soul when it calls.\"\n\nA gifted artist herself, Sister Horne devoted much of her life to the encouragement and welfare of other artists. She supported all groups and individuals interested in poetry, music, and cultural development of every type. Her life was broad and beautiful; she lived fully and richly and helped all who knew her to partake of the same bounty. She leaves an able and gifted family, two sons who are doctors, and three talented and lovely daughters, who are carrying forward much of their mother's unfinished work.\n\nAlice Merrill Horne will be long remembered for her kind nursing of the sick, her innumerable kindnesses as a neighbor, and her untiring devotion as a friend. Many remember her precious guardianship of pioneer ideals and skills. She will also be remembered as a woman richly endowed who gave liberally of all that she possessed.\n\nRelief Society women who attended the annual general Relief Society conference, held just prior to Sister Horne's death, will remember her as she sat on the stand as an honored woman who had labored long and faithfully for the advancement of Relief Society work in all its many phases—a woman of whom we all may well be proud and appreciative that she has lived among us.\n\nNew Serial to Begin in January\n\nTHE first chapter of \"Joanna,\" a new serial by Margery Stockseth Stewart, will begin in the January issue of theThe story relates the courageous efforts of a young widow to give her four children the best in life. The character portrayal is excellent, and the entire story is beautifully written. The author is the wife of Russell Stewart and the mother of two children. She is of Norwegian descent and has received a Citizenship Award from the Salt Lake City Junior Chamber of Commerce given for outstanding accomplishments of descendants of foreign-born Americans. A gifted writer of both stories and poetry, Mrs. Stewart has won many prizes. In 1946 her story \"The Return\" placed first in the Relief Society Short Story Contest. Many of her poems have appeared in the Magazine, including several frontispiece poems. Mrs. Stewart is a member of several literary organizations: the League of Utah Writers, the Barnacles (a Salt Lake City story-writing group), and she recently organized a chapter of the National Writers' Club. Her Church work has been varied, with service in dramatics in the M.I.A., being particularly outstanding.\n\nWINTER\n\nAlice R. Rich\n\nNorth wind, like unleashed fury, comes from bare and sodden hills,\nAnd sapless, naked trees and shrubs creak with its biting chills;\nGray, lumbering clouds roll ominously, without turmoil or sound,\nThen loose their mist to spread a skirt of crystals on the ground.\n\nAprons for Christmas\n\nAlice Willardson\n\nIT seems only yesterday that we had our annual \"Day with Longfellow.\" I mean the day we spend each fall in the canyon. We sit on a hillside in the warm sunshine absorbing the quiet and glorious color while we take turns in reading Longfellow's poems. It has become a sort of personal holiday to keep the autumn from slipping past us.\n\nThis year the maple leaves were so colorful that with the sunlight on them they actually seemed to give off light and warmth like fire, fire which does not leap and fade but remains steadily brilliant. I am glad, too, for the pine boughs and the cedar berries, for today the sky is gray and the wind is furious. Dead leaves are blown carelessly against the windowpanes; the fire in the fireplace feels good. The smell of the pine boughs burning in the grate is so pungent that I can close my eyes and see the Christmas tree. I can see all the gifts and wrappings scattered everywhere and hear all the happy noises and excitement. It won't be long till Christmas! You know!\n\nThis year I think I'll have an apron Christmas! This morning the sewing room looks very cozy and inviting. And just last week I heard Vina say she didn't have a single good apron. She likes one that is big and serviceable. Kate likes them to be sort of pretty and serviceable, too. I have a pattern with a ruffle on the shoulders, pinafore style, that will give it a festive appearance. She likes red, too, and it will sort of go with her kitchen. Anne always loves yellow and I have those scraps of flowered dimity which will combine with either white or yellow organdy beautifully.\n\nThat's one thing about giving aprons; they can be so individual. And they are within the pocketbook of the giver and always welcomed by the receiver. There are so many styles, colors, and materials—aprons for all occasions and all ages. Apron styles like those in illustrations No. 1 and No. 2 will cover your whole dress from danger of splashings. Made from percale, and minus the ruffles, they will be very practical. If made from dimity, they wear exceptionally well, too, and are so pretty to protect your nice dress while you serve the Sunday dinner. With the ruffles, or a touch of applique, they are pretty as well as serviceable. Notice the back in picture No. 2.\n\nIf you are tired of washing and untangling apron strings, this button back is very neat and effective. And if you want to save ironing, leave off the ruffles and just trim with braid, bias tape, or a combination material. There are many other styles for anyone who wants an apron to really work in, one that covers the dress completely. Wrap-around styles are the handiest and most useful aprons for the busy housewife.\n\nNext, there are all the lovely little serving aprons—aprons as pretty and dainty as flowers. These can be No. 4 made from lawn, dimity, organdy, dotted Swiss (and by the way, if you want a very fragile, dainty looking apron that will really stand many washings, you can't beat dotted Swiss). There are three pictures of serving aprons illustrated here, Nos. 3, 4, and 5, which can be made from combinations of materials. They allow you to use scraps of quite a variety of shapes and sizes. Often when you have to use your own ingenuity to make something of the material you already have on hand, the result is much prettier than if you had bought special material and used a commercial pattern. A combination of materials is usually prettier than just one material, and you can use old aprons for cutting patterns for new ones.\n\nNo. 6\n\nAPRON No. 6 gives a suggestion for using applique trimming to form the pocket. Applique is used also to trim No. 7. An excellent idea for getting flowers, fruit, etc., for your applique work is to cut them out from some of the many colorful materials with large and distinct designs.\n\nAprons may be effectively trimmed with ruffles of self material (as illustrated in No. 8) or they may be accented with ruffles of a contrasting color. A very lovely decorative apron was made from white organdy as illustrated in No. 9. Colorful flowers cut from percale were inserted under the hem. The hem was turned over the flowers and fastened down on the right side by a dainty featherstitch. The same motif was also sewed under the organdy pocket. The flowers under the organdy not only made the work less inclined to ravel, and more easily ironed, but they also gave it a sort of ethereal, fairylike touch so suitable to organdy.\n\nNo. 10\n\nThere are no gifts more acceptable to both mothers and daughters than the lovely pinafores illustrated in No. 10. Make the \"daughter\" apron out of material just like mother's.\n\nThere are all types of trimmings, too. Braids and laces of all kinds are on the market now. There are all kinds of handwork, from blanket or featherstitching to lovely embroidery done in silk.\n\nAnd, if you feel so inclined, there are now available fabric paints which are suitable and absolutely washfast. I have a painted tea towel which washes right along with my dish towels regularly.\n\nIf you are looking for something really different, there are all the aprons for special work, like clothespin aprons and sewing aprons. I even got an idea for a man's apron the other day as I watched my son priming the car. Why not make an apron of heavy, waterproof material, containing pockets for the sponge, the cleaner, the wax, the chamois, etc.? Might save a lot of hunting for them. This apron could be hung in the basement after it was used and it would be ready for use again the next time, complete with all the equipment.\n\nMaybe I'm planning a gift that would be more welcomed by the man than by my gift that way, it's an idea!\n\nQuesting Lights\nBelle Watson Anderson\n\nCHAPTER 8 (Conclusion)\n\nWhen a Scotchman really makes up his mind, things begin to happen. That's why Margaret was just hanging up the curtains in the cabin when the Missionary walked in.\n\n\"Andrew!\" She hopped down from the ladder. \"We weren't expecting you so soon. How did you manage it?\"\n\nAndrew spoke impetuously, \"Margaret, when a man's in love, he says to the whole world, 'Step aside, and let me pass!' Well, here I am! Nothing will ever stop me if you are willing, Margaret, could you learn to love me?\"\n\n\"Learn to love you?\" Margaret stood silent for 4 minutes, then laughed joyously. \"You see, man, I am far ahead of you. Like Rachel of old, I have waited seven long years for this, with not the encouragement she received, either,\" her face grew grave as she relived the years in her thoughts.\n\n\"You mean—Oh! Margaret, it is unbelievable.\" He took her tenderly in his arms and kissed her. \"Darling, I will spend a lifetime to say I'm grateful.\"\n\nThe bairns outside heard voices and came in on the run.\n\n\"If only mother could see her bairns today, she wouldna' worry,\" Andrew prophesied. \"Margaret, how can I pay you?\"\n\n\"I love the bairns, Andrew.\" He took them all in his arms together. \"Oh! You are all so marvelous. What a homecoming! I'm a very happy man.\"\n\nIf Andrew had put time and effort into his Missionary work, Margaret had been just as busy in the care of the bairns and the wool. In Tooele she had been thrifty and saved her money. She loved to work in the soft, fine, white wool, and to the cards, she had added a spinning wheel and a loom for weaving carpet and tugs. She had even purchased a jig for knitting socks and stockings. She looked forward to owning a home of her own someday on the millrace, where she would install a large loom for weaving cloth.\n\nLinsey-woolsey was very popular. The loom could be rigged to a water wheel in the big creek. Many bats of many hanks of yarn, white and beautiful colors, for knitting, carpets, come out when she had too much to do, Kathleen and Mother had helped her. So the loom clicked and clattered, and the spinning wheel hummed and away the hours while Andrew had been away preaching the gospel.\n\nIn the cabin Margaret had also put glass in the windows, changed the mud roof for homemade shingles, laid carpet on the floors, and planted many roses and walnut trees around the home. At once, by Margaret had also put glass in the windows, changed the mud roof for homemade shingles, laid carpet on the floors, and planted many roses and walnut trees around the home.\n\nPage 822\n\nANDREW wanted to be married at once, but Margaret wanted a beautiful wedding. At the store when they could not pay her in cash, she got many yards of lovely material, and sometimes whole bolts of lace. She wanted some bonny and dainty things for herself and for her home.\n\nIn Scotland the girls began early to make and plan their trousseaux. Kathleen and Mother were wonderful sewers, and with their help, they all could have beautiful dresses, and she could have some lovely things for her home. So she left the spinning room in the cabin for a sewing room at Mother's for a time.\n\nThey baked a wedding cake, fruit puddings, and shortbread, everything that was essential for a very wonderful wedding. And while they worked they talked.\n\nKathleen and Mother told Margaret of the time when Andrew had raised grain on the river bottoms and timbered in the forest and that when he received word of Jane's marriage he hadn't gone back to the fields or to the forest.\n\n\"Yes, he was hard hit for a time, my darling, but his mission has cured him of all that,\" Mother said.\n\nMargaret remembered the \"Jane look,\" as she had called it on the plains when Andrew would sit for a long time and look far beyond the camp. She had known he was dreaming of Jane. That was all passed now; she did not need to worry about Jane. Margaret knew now that Andrew loved her. Yes, Andrew loved her but why did he not go back to the land and to the forest? The wool was her job. Andrew's was the harvest and grain. She thought of a plan.\n\nShe was curious, and wanted to go to the river bottoms with Andrew Rumgay. She suggested to him that they take a horseback ride the next Saturday afternoon. She was tired of being shut up in the sewing room; she wanted to get out in the sunshine.\n\nAndrew thought it was a wonderful idea, so he brought Gypsy and Pinto up to Mother's for their ride.\n\nThey slowly walked their horses to the canyon. Resplendence was beautiful at this time of year. A tapestry in every tone and color of the autumn had been hung from the ceiling of the mountains. Farther up in the hills, vesper campfires were bright burning. The river sang low, sacred melodies for the rituals of the harvest time.\n\nThey tied their horses to some maple brush and walked into the great silent woodlands. Higher up in the mountains they heard the loud crash of falling trees and the wild cry of timber.\n\n\"The more trees that come down in the forest the more homes go up in the valleys. Many people are coming to the mountains to find homes every year, Margaret. They must find them. Soon I must return to the forests.\"\n\nThey walked back to their horses, mounted, and when they reached the river road Margaret touched the reins with her quirt, and they were off to a gallop towards the bottoms. At the crossing they reined their horses. Margaret was off Pinto in a jiffy. They stood almost speechless in the beauty of the valley and listened to the wild singing of the stream. They found a boulder on the edge of the creek and sat down.\n\nANDREW was particularly interested in the songs of the stream. He smiled.\n\nCan you imagine anything so far-fetched as to interpret these very happy roundelays of music into weird and solemn dirges?\n\"Oh, it's so peaceful here. Wouldn't it be wonderful to live out here? You could farm and I could card wool. When you harvested I could bind and gather the sheaves.\"\n\"When the Indians become more friendly, Margaret, we will build our home in the bottoms.\" Andrew arose and led Margaret to the fields. The one hundred sixty acres had been raised on some of it this year. He picked up some of the fine black soil, pressed it in his hands, and slowly let it fall back to mother earth.\n\"I am like my kinsmen in Scotland, Margaret. I would like to own some land.\"\nMargaret gave a big sigh of relief. \"We will find other fields, darling, and build greater harvests. The bottoms have wonderful dreams of home, wife, and children. Margaret, life will be so complete.\"\nThe young lady looked up and smiled. \"Brother Rumgay, did I remember to tell you that I love you, and I think you are wonderful?\" She put her arms around him and kissed him. \"Name our wedding day, Andrew, and I will make arrangements to be there.\"\nOn their way home Andrew spoke seriously. \"Margaret, we have treasure on our land, but we will never hang on the wall or place on the mantel.\" They walked into the plains one day.\n\"They are more precious than the crown jewels of Scotland. Mother has her rocks, the sage, ginger tea, even the catnip. Then what comes, Margaret?\"\n\"Her prayers and faith, Andrew. I know that my Redeemer liveth.\"\n\"With such a wife, darling, I know I cannot fail.\" They planned to be married as soon as arrangements could be carried out. They would take two covered wagons for the wedding trip to the temple, and all the Macs, and this time the bairns.\nOne afternoon Andrew left his wagon up at Mother Mac's, for the women to pack everything they would need on the trip. They expected to leave at five the next morning. In the evening he went along to see that everything was ready. Bob was just putting in the wagon box the table and benches he had chopped to build fires.\n\"What, no Bob to build the fires?\" Andrew asked.\n\"Mother is taking everything we used on the plains--tents, camp kettles, dishes, bedding, and this time we have a lantern.\"\n\"Mother says we are just now finishing up the trek, attending to the business that should have been taken care of years ago.\"\n\"Your mother has something there, Bob. Why didn't she mention it to me? How are the boxes? Mine are full. I can trust your mother.\"\n\"Well, that part won't be just like the plains,\" Bob gratefully admitted.\nThe Macs had planned to hold a reception at Mother's when they returned, but the people of the ward had taken things over. The meetinghouse was decorated, and the sisters had cooked a big wedding supper at the Hunters. They had baked other wedding cakes, as one would not be enough for everyone in town to have a piece. After the supper there was a wonderful program, and at the last Brother Huntcraft had a few words to say to Andrew and Margaret.\n\"I'll only keep you a few minutes. I know you all want to dance. I'd like to find a word Angus started. Andrew, a few years ago you and I picked out some land on the river bottoms.\n\"Well, after you left on your mission, the people decided that since you were so willing to go into the world and represent us, they would like to do something for you. Tonight we are giving you back the one hundred and sixty acres, all paid for, and nearly all broken up. And this is just one of the many wedding presents the people of Resplendence are giving to you tomorrow night, Brother and Sister Rumgay. A long and happy married life!\"\nAndrew felt he had the world in his arms when the Lord gave him Margaret. Now, with the land, and the many gifts his friends had showered upon them, he was amazed.\nThey called for a speech, and Andrew stood up. \"Brothers and Sisters, my heart is too full for expression tonight. When a man has the gospel, a wife, home, land, beautiful gifts, and kind friends, no words can express his appreciation. I hope through my life and the rest of my life to prove to the Lord, and to you, how grateful I really am. Thanks a lot, folks.\"\nAt the end of the party they passed the wedding cake. Everyone called for a dance by the Macs. The orchestra began playing \"Annie Laurie.\" Brother Coleman danced with Mother Mac, Bob chose Helen Hunter who was just about a Mac.\nMargaret was beautiful in her white wedding gown and long veil of white, soft lace, which she had made, sewing yard after yard, upon row until it was long enough to fall into the full, rippling folds of her dress. She wore a wreath of white satin rosebuds with blue and ivory centers. Her corsage and bouquet were of white and pink lady slippers combined with blue sisters.\nKathleen was lovely in a beautiful shade of yellow. Mother, with the softest of blue hair, was very bonny in pale lavender. Janet, the little flower girl, wore pink.\nThe strains of the romantic music of \"Annie Laurie\" were changed to the sweet rhythm of \"Home, Sweet Home.\" Everyone took partners and joined the Macs in the last dance. The music was sacred, the theme divine, as the bridal couple kept time to its beautiful melody.\n\"I love the cabin down on the millrace, Margaret,\" Andrew spoke softly.\n\"I have learned to love it too.\"\nThey danced a few measures, and Margaret added, \"And the bairns.\"\nAndrew waited breathlessly until Margaret spoke. \"And you, too.\" \n\nChristmas Presents Can Be Different\nElizabeth Williamson\n\nSide from the personalized gifts you will select for your family and close friends this Christmas, there are two other groups you may want to consider—your neighbors, and the people who seem to have everything. Well, who can resist good food, especially if it appeals to someone's special taste and is packaged attractively? Here are some suggestions for the people who have everything:\n\nPage 826\n\nSmall cheeses, wrapped in bright cellophane, and attached to an evergreen branch\nPackaged caviar\nSpreads and relishes\nImported hors d'oeuvres\nHomemade jams or jellies\n\nIf you are famous among your friends for making an unusual cake, or specializing in Christmas plum puddings, or confections, you may want to give one of these. Dates stuffed with fondant seem to be a favorite of everyone. These, wrapped in bright Christmas papers or colored tin foils, are attractive and tempting.\n\nIf your friend who has everything lives in an apartment, she will especially appreciate food. Perhaps some of your home-canned fruits, jellies, or pickles will be very welcome. You may give vegetables from your own garden, such as dried onions, potatoes, or squash.\n\nPackaged fresh fruit, containing oranges, lemons, or grapefruit, with a liberal sprinkling of nuts, is another idea. Put these (fruits or vegetables) in large containers which can be used later. For example, use a wastepaper basket full of assorted fruit, or a magazine rack containing squash and onions. Dish drainers, lettuce drainers, or anything which appeals to your imagination can be used.\n\nYour close neighbors very likely will have the same type of garden, grow the same vegetables, and make the same jams and jellies you do, so perhaps the food suggested above 827 will not serve as a very exciting gift for them, but don't you think freshly baked Christmas pastry, or a big crunchy breakfast cake, dotted with nuts and maraschino cherries, will appeal to them for their Christmas breakfast? Individual plum puddings, a mincemeat pie, fruitcakes, will be gratefully received. Your neighbor will be very pleased to know that you haven't forgotten her during the rush of the holiday season.\n\nChristmas Letter\nGrace Rushton Squire in the real sense of the word, Christmas means more to a mother than it means to anyone else.\nThat means more than a mother? It commemorates the birth of the Savior, and who knows just what lies in the hearts of all mothers as a sacred knowledge of the reality for which Christ truly stands—the birth of a little Babe. The spirit of that Babe of Bethlehem dwells in every mother's heart and acts as a focus which at Christmas time, when hearts are softened with the spirit of giving, draws closer the bond of kindred hearts, which the cares, pleasures, and sorrows of this world are continually striving to break.\nAt this season of the year, when the earth is wrapped in a sheet of white, when trees are bare and nature is lying asleep, the heart is turned to the spiritual and moral. The call is for in her family lie her hopes, joys, and ambitions. The mother's heart is then calling her family—the family circle that is where her heart is calling.\n\nMargaret C.

Under the able direction of President Anne Bean, the principal goal of this group has been to support the Welfare program to their utmost.\n\"Already on the way to Europe,\" Sister Killpack reports, \"are five large and five small quilts, ten baby blankets, seventeen kimonas, and two dozen pairs of mittens. The mittens are exceptionally outstanding as they were all made from old winter coats, then lined with flannel, and reinforced with the tops of men's socks to hold them tight at the wrists. Thus they are warm, resisting both the rain and the snow. Along with these were sent boxes of made-over garments.\"\n\nPage 828\nNotes From the Field 829\n\nPhotograph submitted by Fern B.

Especially honored was Sister Mary Rockwood (inset), ninety years of age, who has been a secretary in Relief Society for more than twenty-five years. As an infant she was brought across the plains to Utah in a covered wagon. As a young woman she was an officer in the Retrenchment Society and also delivered copies of the Woman's Exponent from door to door, to save postage for mailing that pioneer publication.\n\"The mother of ten children, Sister Rockwood experienced the hard work and trials connected with rearing a large family under pioneer conditions. She made soap, candles, quilts, carpets, and clothing; she dried fruit, took care of a garden, sat up with the sick, and helped to prepare the dead for burial. Sister Rockwood now lives in Huntington Park Ward with her daughter Laura Stephens.\nRose B.

Unmistakable, the familiar young hand on the pudgy old body! She could almost see the willing-to-please expression behind that puffy, round smile. Wanting to laugh almost as much as she wanted to cry, Adele remained for the rest of the conversation. \"You won't be seeing me on Christmas Eve, boys, but I'll be seeing you,\" concluded Santa Claus.\n\nAS the boys moved out of earshot, Adele stepped forward. \"Isn't it about time for your lunch, Santa?\" she inquired. \"I beg your pardon, madam,\" Roy said. Then, noticing the giveaway in the tone of his voice, despite his effort to disguise it, he added ruefully, \"I might have known you'd find me out. I admit it's more than lunch time. Just wait a second, while I change coats, and I'll take you out for a sandwich.\"\n\n\"I have to talk to a saleswoman upstairs,\" said Adele. \"Tl attend to that while I wait. But, Roy, whatever happened at Freem's, you should have told me.\" \"Nothing spectacular happened at F'reem's,\" he stated simply. \"Just the unexpected return from Tokyo of one Major Dickson, an expert assistant manager, with honorable discharge papers in good order, and considerably more than a murmur ailing his heart. I would have told you, if I hadn't known that I could keep us in the income class by Santa Clausing until Christmas and helping with the pre-inventory sale here until the new year. And after that I have the promise of helping out with income tax returns at the State Capitol. In my spare time I'll continue to haunt the employment agency, in the hope of getting something really good lined up again.\"\n\n\"And I know you will,\" reassured Adele.\n\nThe beauty of it was, she felt, that she actually did know that he would. It might be ridiculous, but, after all, it was traditional to feel just this warmly confident when one walked beside that bulky, redclad figure. All the while she had worried so about wherever Roy could be, he had been fully competent to take care of his share in their partnership.\n\nConscious that Roy was still talking as he led her toward the back of the store, Adele centered her attention on his words. \"I certainly wasn't going to tell you about this stunt until afterward. I'm glad it doesn't strike you as being too rugged. But, once I get a real job lined up again, no more of this Santa Claus gag for me!\"\n\n\"T wasn't going to tell you, either,\" said Adele, and the merriment in her eyes became something that was deeper.\n\n\"But, 'Lean your ear this way,' Saint Nicholas! No matter how good a job you line up—from this year on, you'll have to count on assuming the role of Santa Claus, permanently.\"\n\nLIVING TO ENJOY THE BLESSINGS OF THE LORD 833 Living to Enjoy the Blessings of the Lord (Continued from page 800) before you, in the not far distant future, the possibility of a building, a women's building, erected by the generosity and self-sacrifice and faith and devotion of the women of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, that will be the equal, I am sure, of any building that women use in all the world as a women's building. So I congratulate you on your possibilities, on your probabilities, because I think in the not far distant future, if the world will come to its senses, if they will stop quarreling with one another, people will stop fighting one another and do more praying and less fussing, I think we can begin the erection of our building for the Relief Society that will not only give joy to you who are particularly interested, but all the rest of us will be happy that you have it.\n\nWe have been doing a lot of repairing of one kind and another, been working on this organ, making that a little better than it was before, that is, we hope we have. I have not been listening to it lately, but I am assuming that it is very 'much improved, and when they get it finished I am sure we will all be happy. But think what it means. Here you are. You have come into this greatest of all houses of worship. \"There is not anything else like it, no other house in the world with a dome like this, no other house in the world that has the acoustics that this building has, and in this building we have one of the loveliest organs that anybody has in all the world. And wonderful choirs sing here. The voices of our Father's sons and daughters are heard here. It does seem to me when we sing if we would just appreciate how good he has been to us, it ought to be the easiest thing in the world to sing his praises while we are here in this marvelous building.\n\nBlessings of Saints As I look over the audience I see the children and the children's children of some of those who were pioneers, came into this valley in an early day, and they came here with the word of the Lord in their hands. They not only had the Old and the New Testament, the Holy Bible, but they brought with them the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great Price, and other scriptures, all that the world has in the way of true scripture we have, plus a lot of other scripture that the world has not had until the Lord gave it to us. Surely we are not unmindful of all these things.\n\nAnd when I think of the beautiful block that we are on here, and the flowers and the shrubs and the trees, the glorious sunshine that we enjoy here in this part of the world, and all of the blessings that God has bestowed upon us in such a rich way, and our homes, I am extremely grateful. Do you realize that when the people came into this valley, a little over one hundred and one years ago, there was not a house that a human being could live in? Now look at it. Lovely homes, lovely churches, streets, conveniences of almost every kind you can think of.\n\nI cannot think\nof a convenience that is important in all the world that we do not have\nright here in this valley that a hundred and one years ago was a desert.\nAnd when President Brigham Young looked over this valley and said: 'This is the place,' I can imagine that there were people in that group of 143 men, three women, and two children, who thought he must be dreaming. They could not imagine that this could be the place the Lord wanted them to settle.\nBut it was, and see what has happened.\nAnd now, people come from all parts of the world to see what has been accomplished here in the last hundred years. Hardly a week passes that somebody does not come into the office who has never been here before and says, \"This is one of the most beautiful cities as you have here.\"\nPromises to the Righteous\nNow, all the blessings that have come to us, brothers and sisters, are the result of keeping the commandments of God. All these blessings are not the result of our willfulness, our carelessness, or our indifference, but they are the result of honoring God and keeping his commandments, and there have been enough of our people who have saved the day for the rest.\nYou will remember in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah, when Abraham pleaded for two great cities that they be not destroyed because the people were so wicked, and when he asked: \"Why would you not destroy the righteous people who are there in those cities,\" and the heavenly personage said to him: \"No, not if there are enough of them.\"\nThen Abraham began to plead. \"If there are fifty people in those two great cities can they all be saved?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Forty?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Thirty?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Twenty?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Ten?\"\nYes.\nThat is how precious righteous people are. Let us not forget that.\nIf there had been ten righteous people in those two great cities, and they were populous cities, the fire would not have come down from heaven to destroy them, but they would have had another chance.\nNow, think of what we have here. Think of the righteous men and women that live in the community that you live in, and they are righteous. They are not perfect. I do not know any perfect people, but I have known some that it seemed to me were just as near perfect as it was possible to be. That is what the Lord has promised. If you seek first, not last, but seek his kingdom and his righteousness and all other things will be added that are worthwhile. That is what he means.\nAnd think what we have. Think of the peace and quiet enjoyed here today and in some parts of the world bombs may be dropped any moment, guns may begin firing at any time. Why? Because the difference being, here we are trying to do what our Heavenly Father would like us to do and there, many of them are doing what they know they should not do.\nNow, my brethren and sisters, and particularly the sisters, because you are the majority in this great audience today by far, I congratulate you. I congratulate you on belonging to the finest organization in all the world, officered, managed, and planned and carried on by women. There is not anything else like it, and I hope that you will keep in mind the suggestion of one of your sisters today to look after those who are not taking advantage of their opportunities. Do a little missionary work wherever you are and encourage others to do the same thing, and instead of having a few thousand people who are willing to do what the Lord wants them to do and make every effort to do that, there will be millions of people who are influenced to keep the commandments of God and stay the destruction that the Lord has said will come upon the earth unless the people repent of their sins and turn to him. He has already assured us that it will take repentance.\nI would not like to sound a discordant note here, nor cause anybody to begin to worry because of the destruction that may come, but I can say this that the Lord has promised you in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that if you will seek first his kingdom, that all desirable things will be added. That means the undesirable things will be stayed and your homes will be the abiding place of peace and thanksgiving and gratitude to God, and mothers and fathers will love one another and work together in rearing their families. Parents will cherish their children and bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, and children will be taught to honor father and mother with the assurance that their days may be long in the land that the Lord our God gives unto us.\nGratitude for Hospitality\nI have just touched upon a few of the things that the Lord has promised to us and to all people who will accept him and his advice. I think it is marvelous. I want to take this occasion to thank you, good women living in different parts of the country, who have taken care of us who are General Authorities of the Church as we have traveled through the country; we have been in your homes. You have fed us; you have given us places where we could be made comfortable, and in many cases you and your husbands have carried us on our way. I am grateful to you for the kindness that I have received.\nIt has been marvelous to me how many times I have been in a position where I needed real help, and it has come as a result of good women and good men in the community where I happened to be.\nNow, coming back to the building, I wish we could tell you right now when it can be started. I wish we could tell you just when a number of them could be started. We are needing buildings for the Church in so many cases. We were in need of over four hundred houses of worship and structures to be used by the Church a year ago, and it may interest you to know that over two hundred of them are already finished or are in the course of completion.\nHalf of them, but there are yet another two hundred and more, and in so many cases where two communities or three use the same house for worship, in due time each will have its own house and its place of recreation, and all will meet together as brothers and sisters under the influence of the Spirit of the Lord.\nHow wonderful it is to have that influence. Come into this building when there is not a soul here and close your eyes and I think you will feel like others have.\n\nTime after time people have said there seems to be an influence here that I have never felt any place else. There should be. There should be an influence in this building that people can feel because the Lord has promised that his Spirit will abide in these places that have been dedicated to him as long as we treat them as we ought to. I congratulate you. I wish I had words to express my appreciation for what you are doing, what has been done by those who have preceded you and for what your daughters who are coming along will do even after you are gone. What an opportunity the Lord has blessed us with, to give us the fulness of the earth in these marvelous mountain vales, and all the advantages and opportunities of the civilization of our day, plus the testimony that burns in the souls of hundreds of thousands of people that we are the children of God and we know it, and if we are righteous, may remain close to him throughout the ages of eternity. I congratulate the leadership of this great organization, your presidency and general board, the stake officers, and the ward officers. If you could get them all together this block would not hold them, to say nothing of this building. They are a great army of women and when you realize that at one time ten righteous people could have saved Sodom and Gomorrah from destruction, think what an influence you have, think what power you have in this world if you are recorded among those who are righteous, honoring God and keeping his commandments. It will not be long before disaster will come to the earth. It will not be very long before this earth will be cleansed and purified by fire and become the celestial kingdom, but in the meantime, the Lord has given to us the opportunity to go forward, rear our families, develop our homes, prepare our institutions of learning and all the advantages, under the influence of the same spirit, if we will, that will be here when our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, our Lord, will be here in person. Think what a wonderful thing it is! That is the preparation for it, that is why these commandments were given and the other commandments of the Lord, not to prevent us from happiness, but to add to our joy and our comfort and our satisfaction, day by day, while we go forward looking to the time when we will be with those whom we love forever. As I stand here today I realize it may not be long until the summons reaches me. When it comes I will pass out of the picture here in mortality, but when that time comes I am looking forward to meeting the dear ones that have preceded me, those who have gone before. And LIVING TO ENJOY THE BLESSINGS OF THE LORD there are many of them on the other side that have gone through the experiences of mortal life, have lived true and faithfully and devotedly, so that our Heavenly Father has promised them they may return to earth as celestial beings and dwell here throughout the ages of eternity. That is what these books are for. That is why the Lord gives us so much information that we refer to as scripture. It is not that we may have food and clothing and houses and lands here. That is only a part of it. It is that day by day we may so adjust our lives that we will become more perfect as the years go by, rear our families to be more perfect. That is the purpose of it all, in order that all may be saved in the celestial kingdom and have the companionship of those who are dear to us, forever. Relief Society for All the Sisters That is what this great organization you belong to was instituted for. It was not just to make quilts. It was not just to go from door to door and ask people to make a contribution to your fund. That was only a part of it. The Relief Society of this Church was organized that all of the daughters of our Heavenly Father, I say all of them, because it was intended that they should, those who are worthy should be identified with the Relief Society of the Church, and that each one should not only be a member but that each should be a faithful, devoted daughter of the Lord, working in that organization of Relief Society for the blessing of all your sisters. What an influence you have in the world, and how much more influence can be had if you can persuade your sisters in the communities in which you live, that are not doing anything particular in preparation for eternal life in the celestial kingdom, to come into the fold and begin work. I have been talking about the sisters, inferring that there are some women that are not yet doing all they should in the Church, but I would like to say to the two or three or half a dozen brethren that are here, we have a whole group of men in the Church whom unless we can get the sisters to help us, I do not think we will get very far with. We have men in the Church who have grown up in it, who do not even hold the Priesthood and we have others who ought to hold the Melchizedek Priesthood who only hold the Aaronic Priesthood, hundreds of them, and if they die under those circumstances they may lose their opportunity of eternal life in the celestial kingdom, and they are your brothers and husbands and fathers, in some cases. I do not mean you who are sitting here, but I mean the women, husbands and fathers and brothers, these men, and we need to do teamwork, and we need to set our homes in order. If our sisters would only encourage their husbands to do their part, visiting in the wards in which they live as ward teachers, trying to draw the men in that have not done just what they should, and then the women would go out and do their share, encouraging the women to come in. Do you realize what the Lord has said? What matters it though you spend your whole life here upon earth, performing the duties incident to mortality, spend your whole life, and during that time the result of your effort is the salvation of one soul, and that your own? He said you shall have great joy in our Father's kingdom with that soul. We all have something to do, and I congratulate you on what you have done.\n\nNo other group of women in all the world has compared with what you have done in the way of blessing mankind, rearing your families and devoting yourselves unselfishly to bringing peace and happiness to those that were in distress, and because of that, the Lord loves you, and he is anxious that you should have every advantage and every blessing, and he will give it to you just as fast as you are worthy. I am grateful to be here with you today. I thank these sisters who invited me to come and visit with you, and I want to be among those who will be permitted to come into your new building when it is completed. I hope that it may be kept so sweet and clean and wholesome and beautiful and delightful that the Spirit of the Lord will find comfort there. That is what I hope it to be, and I trust that that will be in the not far distant future. I wish I could tell you just where it could be located. I wish I knew, but it will not be far away from the Temple. It will not be far away from the Tabernacle, and I want to say to you it will not be very far away from the Lord, and that is the important part. So keep smiling, keep working, keep planning, and praying. Remember your sisters in the old world, millions of them, who have comparatively no comforts. In twenty-four hours they could not enjoy the peace that you have here in five minutes in this building today, wherever they are, and they are your sisters. We have over five thousand missionaries in the world endeavoring to bring the peace and happiness that you have to our Father's other sons and daughters. A good many of those in the world are women. There was a time when our sisters did not go into the world very much as missionaries. There was a time when some of the mission presidents did not think they could do missionary work very well, it was so difficult, but if you would see some of the letters that are written in from mission presidents now, \"Cannot you send us some of those fine women that can do such splendid work among the women and among the children in these lands?\" There is a way. It is coming. In the not far distant future there will be more missionaries out. If we will just keep the standard of liberty and of righteousness floating here in our homeland, keeping our homes in order, husbands faithful and devoted to wives, and wives faithful and devoted to husbands, parents to children, children to parents, neighbors to neighbors, remembering that the second great commandment referred to in this wonderful volume by the Savior of the world was: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\" If we did that how wonderful it would be to go from house to house and from village to village and find dwelling in every heart the Spirit of God burning there in a luminous, delightful way, filling the soul with happiness and peace and comfort and satisfaction and knowing that that will endure forever. I pray that the Lord will bless LIVING TO ENJOY THE BLESSINGS OF THE LORD these presiding officers, the general officers, the stake officers, the ward officers, all these who have responsibility, and oh, let your light so shine that others seeing your good works will be constrained to glorify the name of our Heavenly Father. We are his children. This is a part of his family that is gathered here today. How wonderful it is to know that he is not far from us, that he is all-powerful, and has promised us that if trouble comes, if necessary he will come down in heaven, not from heaven, he will bring heaven with him upon this earth and fight our battles and preserve us, and we will go on living throughout the ages of eternity. That is the promise of our Heavenly Father.\n\n| Again, I thank you for your kindness to me and to my associates as we travel in your communities, your kindness to all those who need you, your kindness to those people who live across the great and mighty ocean. I do not know whether you have been told, but probably you have, one hundred and twelve carloads, each car the capacity of forty tons, a hundred and twelve carloads of food and bedding and clothing have been shipped across the ocean 839 since the war to feed and make comfortable your other brothers and sisters, some of whom have not yet come into the Church. That has been your contribution. How many quilts did you have? We have had in total about nine thousand. My goodness! Just about two months from now you will wake up some morning, somebody has left the window open and the fire has gone out and you will wish you had just one more quilt, and then realize that the organization that you belong to, in that one item—that is only one item—over nine thousand handmade, homemade, quilts have been made by your organization, and then you have asked for the privilege of giving them, not selling them 'of giving them to our Father's other children that they may be, in part at least, as comfortable as you are. God bless you for your faith and your devotion and your fine work. Keep your homes in order. Keep the adversary away. Live so that the Spirit of God will be with you all the time, and I can say to you that if you will do that you will be happy all the time and that you may so be, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n\nONE LONE STAR\nDorothy J. Roberts\n\nI shall be there; I must return\nTonight when one lone star will burn\nAcross the acres of the world.\nBefore its last faint gleam is furled\nI shall follow the camel's hoof;\nSee winter silver on the roof;\nAnd set my heart attune to hear—\nDespite the centuries—one clear Hosanna,\nFiltered though it be, coming from hilltops far from me.\n\nI shall breathe the scent of myrrh\nBlent by the kneeling worshipper;\nAnd behold the jewels spread\nBeside one on his humble bed.\nWith all the hungering hosts of men,\nI shall partake of peace again.\nBefore the waning year is spent\nI shall return for sacrament."

    "content": "the Annual General Relief Society Conference, Thursday, September 30, 1948). Could witness this picture as I see it. In no other place can it be seen but here, not only to see but to feel the influence of the Lord that pervades this building. I am looking into the faces of women from many parts of this country, and some from other lands, every one is a daughter of our Father in heaven. Is it not worth something to know that? Is there anything else that you can think of that would give you more satisfaction than to know that you are a child of our Father in heaven, and that he has given you the opportunity to live on the earth at this period of time when the gospel has been restored? 'That was only 118 years ago. That does not mean very much in the long period of time in the world's history, but think what has been accomplished in that time. How marvelous are the changes. When the Prophet Joseph Smith was born, he came into a humble home, a humble father and mother, but they were real Christians. His mother loved the truth and she loved her children. So Joseph, when he was just a boy, had the guidance of one of our Father's choicest daughters. I wonder sometimes as I travel throughout the country and see the hundreds of thousands of people Page 796 I wish everybody in the world scattered everywhere, how many of them there are that realize that they are the children of the Lord. He is the Father of our spirits. And how wonderful it is to live in this day and age of the world among a group of people who know that fact.\n\nWe are in this great building that was erected during the poverty of the people. They did not have steel to use as we have today. They did not have the electric lights. There are many things that we enjoy today that they did not have, but they built the greatest Tabernacle, the greatest house of worship in many respects, that has been built since the world began, and we are permitted to worship here.\n\nThink of it, sisters. We have no way of measuring the blessings of the Lord unless we live so that we can enjoy them. We have been told here today that there are certain requirements that we must observe if we are to enjoy all that we should enjoy. And by the way, I believe I would like to turn here to one of the early books of the Bible and read to you what the Lord said, not in the beginning of time, but in the beginning of the peopling of this earth, when there were comparatively few on the earth. People did not know a lot of things that they know now. They did not understand the purpose of many things, but the Lord in his mercy began in the very beginning to give the people advice, his advice. He was not guessing about it because he knew.\n\nSometimes we give advice and I fear we just guess about it, but I am thinking now of the condition of the world after nearly six thousand years that the people have lived upon it, and the sorrow and distress and anxiety that exist. There never has been a time in the world when people knew as much as they know now. There has never been a time when there were as many comforts enjoyed by the people. It is marvelous what has been coming into the world all this time, and yet I think I am safe in saying that the majority of all the Lord's children who have lived upon the earth have fallen short of being what he wanted them to be.\n\nBut there was no justification for not following his advice and benefiting thereby because they had his commandments from the beginning. The Ten Commandments Let us consider for a moment some of the Ten Commandments. \"Thou shalt have no other gods before me.\" Why should we? The Lord did not say we may not, but he said we shall not choose who is God, and there is no other god that can take his place. He is our Father. He has been the Father of all the people that have lived upon the earth, the Father of their spirits.\n\nAll of us have that wonderful blessing that we trace ourselves back to our Heavenly Father. And then he says: \"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, 797 or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them.\" In other words, anything that we may propose, other than our Heavenly Father; we may call it what we will, but it does not become God and we may worship it, but we will not be benefited by doing so. And he says: \"I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.\" Not only does the sorrow come to the individual in the first generation of those who hate him, but he says that it passes on to the third and fourth generation. How foolish we are, then, not to pay attention to him who is the Father of us all and who loves us and is anxious that every one of us should enjoy the kingdom of heaven, and how foolish we are if we listen to the suggestions and intimations and counsel of those who are not of God and who do not know what he knows.\n\nNow he says further: \"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.\" Think of the profanity that is in the world today, the carelessness with which the name of our Heavenly Father is used, and yet the Lord warned our fathers several thousand years ago that we were not to take his name in vain. He says further: \"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.\" Why should we keep the Sabbath day holy? There are blessings that attach to us if we observe the Sabbath day and if we fail to observe it we lose our blessing, yet the majority of our Father's children who live upon this earth today, in this dispensation, do not honor the Sabbath day as our Heavenly Father has advised them to do. And what will be the result, what has been the result? The result has been the loss of many blessings. As our sister was telling us a few moments ago, we may not pay much attention to this thing, but if we expect to enjoy the blessings of our Heavenly Father, we must observe the law that governs that blessing. He has told us that.\n\nSo, today, think of the condition in the world in regard to the Sabbath day. It is not what the Lord has advised, but it is what people wish to do who love pleasure more than they love God.\nI might go on and say: \"For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.\"\nJust think what a wonderful world this would be if one day in seven all of our Father's children, your brothers and sisters and mine, would keep the Sabbath day holy. The power that would come into the lives of the human family cannot be measured or estimated. It would be marvelous what a change would occur in this world, because, not only would they enjoy the result of honoring the Sabbath day, they would close to our Heavenly Father on his holy day, but their minds would be expanded to think of righteousness on the other days, and\nthe world would be a different world in which to live.\n\nNow he says: \"Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.\"\nThere is a promise. What a wonderful thing it is to feel that we have lived, if we have, honoring father and mother, to be entitled to have our days prolonged. That does not seem a very difficult thing for us to do, to give honor and consideration and kindness and love to those who were the means of bringing us into the world. Surely it ought to be the simplest and easiest thing in all the world, and yet, I am afraid that even among our people, there are men and women who ignore that wonderful piece of advice, to honour father and mother, and in dishonoring them or failing to recognize them as they should, the blessings that they would desire and they might enjoy pass by them.\n\nThe Lord says: \"Thou shalt not kill.\" In other words, thou shalt not take life. Just think of what that means, and think of today. You take your daily papers and pick them up and read the headlines and see in all parts of the world where the messages have come from, how many people are losing their lives because of the selfishness of somebody else who is anxious to enjoy and take from them what they have.\n\nNow the Lord says: \"Thou shalt not commit adultery.\"\nI wonder if we realize what a terrible thing it is to violate that advice of Heaven's Father. Many people have an idea that it brings to them pleasure and satisfaction, and yet it brings to them sorrow and sickness and death. The Lord has warned us, long, long ago, and yet the world today is in the condition that it is in, very largely because our Father's other children, his sons and daughters, will not pay attention to his advice and counsel and the result is unhappiness—death to hundreds and thousands of people in this world who ought to be filled with happiness and satisfaction all the time.\n\nNow: \"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.\"\nI wonder if we realize that if we tell a story about our neighbor, if we refer to our neighbor, if we say something to injure him, not telling the truth, that we violate one of the loving counsels of the Father of us all. He said we should not do that, and if we do, we do not gain anything, we always lose.\n\nNow he says: \"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.\"\nIn other words, we should not be selfish and try to obtain and take from others that which belongs to them.\n\nI have just been reading to you some of the paragraphs of advice of your Father and mine. I have just been calling your attention to the fact that this I have read to you today has been in print for thousands of years. People all over the world do not have the Bible as we have it, but they have access to it in most parts of the world, and among all the wonderful things that are contained in this marvelous record that I hold in my hand, I have just read about ten simple things,\ncounsels of our Heavenly Father, that, and this I want you to remember, that if we observe, if the people of the world observe these commandments there would be no war, there would be no hatred, there would be no sorrow, compared to what we have in the world today, and the ten counsels of our Heavenly Father who knoweth all things, and we have had it all the way down through the ages, and the result is that because we have failed to pay attention to it, this world is in the condition it now is in, and you do not know, nobody knows, how soon another world war may be started, and if we have another, how much more serious it will be than anything else we have ever had.\n\nWell now, in the days of the Savior, at least in the days of John the Revelator, he heard a voice and that voice said: \"Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.\"\nThat was the voice from heaven that came to him. Do you know that is why you are here today.\n\nDo you know that is why your forebears left the world, that it was because God had advised his people to gather out from Babylon, gather out from the evils that have afflicted mankind for so long, and come to the tops of these everlasting mountains. When we came here they were so barren and forbidding and desolate that some of those who were in the first company wept when President Young said: \"This is the place.\"\nBut you sit in this place, and you may go from one end of the world to the other and you will find no other part of the world that is as blessed as has been the part that has been inhabited by the membership of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, not because they were all perfect, but there were enough of them who have kept the commandments of God, that we have been enabled to go on and on and on, and so today you meet in the most remarkable house of worship in the world; you listen to one of the greatest and most wonderful organs; you have listened today to a marvelous choir of sisters. And I might go on and on. And then you go outside of the building and you stand upon one of the most delightful spots that you can find anywhere. These buildings upon this block have not been erected selfishly. They have been built that we might learn the very Ten Commandments that I have been reading to his children.\nI did not know I was going to read the Ten Commandments when I stood up here, but I think probably it is profitable to do; we will just think about them, and when we realize that if the people of the world had been keeping the Ten Commandments as I have read them to you today—only a part—I only read just a part—we would not be in the condition we are today, and we would be a much further advanced in all the sciences and the blessings that our Heavenly Father has in store for his children and have not yet come to us.\nBlessings of Relief Society\nBrethren and sisters, I congratulate the brethren, and I particularly congratulate the sisters that belong to the great Relief Society organization of the Church. There is not any other organization like it, when I realize what you have been doing in the last year or two, gathering means that you might have a doing of your own, that you might worship in if you desire to worship there, that you might transact your business in, a building that you can invite your sisters from all parts of the world to come to and share with you the blessings of our Heavenly Father that have been so richly bestowed upon you.\nThere are no women in the world blessed as you have been blessed. There are occasionally women who have been marvelously blessed, but when it comes to a community, I know of no other place where women have been blessed as you have been in the communities in which you live.\nAnd so I am happy to be here and so I am today, congratulate you that you are looking forward now to having a building of your own. I think that when that time comes, as possibly it is not very far away, and you are today, I think you will be. And it is not very far away. You have gone out and in a short time have made contributions for the amount that insures a building. Now, you were satisfied with the small building over here that cost a few thousand dollars, eight thousand dollars was the amount the Relief Society put into that building, as I remember it now. How would you like to take that building now and surrender five hundred and fifty-five thousand dollars? You would not think you had made a very good trade, and yet you have\n(Continued on page 833)"

    "content": "Effective Choral Organization\nFlorence Jepperson Madsen\nMember, Relief Society General Board\n\nJust as the piano and organ are built to produce balanced volume when chords are played, so should a singing group be organized to produce a tonal balance when engaged in part singing. Therefore, when effecting a singing organization, careful attention should be given in choosing the proper number and type of voices for the various parts. Thus, for example, in a chorus of fifty trained singers the division should be about as follows: twenty first sopranos, sixteen second sopranos, and fourteen altos.\n\nIn organizations made up of both trained and untrained singers, or of untrained singers entirely, the proportion of distribution necessarily varies. One may be able to sing the soprano part in a mixed chorus with comparative ease and still be unable to sustain the highest part in a women's chorus without effort and strain. This is due to the fact that in a women's chorus there are two and often three voices singing below the soprano, necessitating constant singing on higher pitch levels; while, in a mixed chorus, there is but the one treble voice (alto) below the soprano, therefore, generally requiring a more normal range of voice. In classifying and distributing membership care should be exercised, especially in relation to the sopranos so that only those who can sustain high tones easily should be selected for this part. Thus it is seen that those who are chosen to sing the first soprano part should possess voices of the high, lyric type. Such classification not only conduces to better tone quality but also to more accuracy in pitch. One loud, strained voice can upset the pitch of an entire group. When not enough high sopranos are available to balance the other parts of a chorus, it is advisable to choose songs which the moderately high soprano voices can sing with ease. It is often necessary to strengthen the second soprano part. This is easily done by having a number of the medium high sopranos assist. However, different members should be chosen for different songs, thus giving more sopranos experience in singing inner parts.\n\n'The value of such experience is emphasized by Robert Schumann in the following statement: \"Sing frequently in choruses, especially on the middle parts. This makes you musical.\" MUSIC C. Cameron Johns\n\nThis is the universal tongue;\nThe soft diapason speaks to every heart,\nIn simple terms that each may understand.\nThere is no Babel\nWhere the searching fingers of melody\nExplore the labyrinth of sound.\nIn the might roll and ebb of notes\nThe organ speaks to the earth-bound\nWith the voice of God.\n\nPage 840\nTheology—The Life and Ministry of the Savior\nLesson 14—\"A Period of Darkening Opposition\"\nElder Don B. Colton (Reference: Jesus the Christ, Chapter 22, by Elder James E. Talmage)\n\nFor Tuesday, March 1, 1949\n\nObjective: To acquaint class members with the events of the Savior's life during the time he was preparing the apostles for their final great responsibilities.\n\nNote: All quotations which are not followed by references are taken from the text Jesus the Christ.\n\nOur Lord had spent two years in the great work of his ministry during which he had received considerable popular acclaim. The plain people heard him gladly. There was a turning against him that boded ill during the third year. That was the sifting period when those who really believed would be separated from the \"lukewarm\" and those who were openly opposed. Spies had been watching him closely both in Galilee and Jerusalem.\n\nCeremonial Washings\n\"And Many Such Like Things\"\n\nJesus began detailed instructions to the apostles. He wanted them to be prepared to carry on after his foreknown death. They were yet to make a great change in discarding the rabbinical forms and ceremonies of the Jews and to go wholly to the plain, but glorious requirements of the gospel of the kingdom.\n\nAlready, with the approval of the Lord, they had so far transgressed \"the tradition of the elders\" as to omit the practice of ceremonial cleansing of hands before eating. They were ignoring customs that had become rabbinical laws. It should be remembered that \"the offense charged against the disciples was that of ceremonial uncleanliness, not physical uncleanliness or disregard of sanitary propriety.\" Not because they had soiled hands, were they criticized, but because they did not perform the ceremony.\n\nWhen this criticism was made, Jesus replied by asking a question, \"Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?\" He called them hypocrites and cited Isaiah's prophecy, \"... This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me\" (Mark 7:6). To prove his accusation he cited the commandment of God, \"Honor thy father and thy mother.\" Moses had even proclaimed death to him \"that curseth his father, or his mother\" (Ex. 21:17), The law requiring a son to assist needy parents had been so changed\n\nPage 841\n\nCHRIST HEALING THE SICK\nPage 842\n\nA Perry Picture From a Painting by Schonherr\nthat a wicked or ungrateful son could escape responsibility by declaring a thing required by parents to be \"corban,\" something intended as a gift to God. (Read Mark 7:11.) The undutiful son had a lifetime to make the gift. In other words, these unauthorized changes made the word of God noneffective. \"They were straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel.\"\n\nIn this day the members of the Church are taught the same fundamental law of honoring one's father and mother and caring for one's relatives. A fundamental concept of the great Church Welfare Plan is to provide for one's own. Present-day Church leaders have pointed out, quoting words of the Savior, the duty of children to parents, of husband to wife, of parents to children, concerning adult children, and the position of widows, orphans, and the poor.\n\nNo Church member in this day can excuse himself as not having been taught to care for his own insofar as it is possible to do so (See \"Fundamentals of the Church Welfare Plan,\" Pres. J. Reuben Clark, Jr., General Conference, October 6, 1944).\n\nLeaving those who were trying to trap him, Jesus called the people together and taught them a great truth:\n\n. . . Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand: There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man. If any man have ears to hear, let him hear (Mark 7:14-16).\n\nThis announcement came in direct conflict with the rabbinical teachings of the day. The Pharisees took offense. Their rule was not only to wash the hands but also to clean them by ritual. Jesus explained that the food taken into the body remained only for a time. It was that which came from the mouth which defiled. Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts and all manner of crimes. \"As we think, so we are.\"\n\nThere was to be no compromise between the teachings of the Lord and corrupt Judaism. Jesus could only state his doctrine and let the consequences follow. When principle is involved, there can be no compromise.\n\nWithin the Borders of Tyre and Sidon\nJesus, evidently seeking seclusion where he might instruct the Twelve, decided to go north into the country known as Phoenicia. But, in the language of one of the disciples, his presence \"could not be hid.\" There were people in the region of Tyre and Sidon who had heard him speak and knew of his fame. The Canaanites were held in particular disrepute. However, one woman of that tribe came to the Master and said, \". . .\n\nHave mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.\" By the manner of her address she clearly showed her faith in the Messiah. She continued her pleadings until the disciples asked him to send her away. Her earnest cry, \"... Lord, help me,\" and the faith and persistence she manifested, touched the Savior and he said unto her, \". . . O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour\" (Matt. 15:22-28). (It is recommended that class members read also Mark 7:24-30.) \n\nSome wonder why the Lord delayed granting the request of the woman. Well, we do not always know God's ways. We do know that the woman's faith was proved and it was a great lesson to the disciples. The blessings of the Christ were for all who had faith. They were not to be confined to the children of Israel. After Jesus left Tyre and Sidon, he traveled for some days among people who were not Jews. Wherever he went he healed the lame, blind, and maimed. When they saw the mighty works, the gentiles glorified the God of Israel. In one particular instance, the people asked the Lord to lay his hands upon a man who was deaf and defective in speech. Jesus led the man away from the crowd, then put his hands in the man's ears and touched his tongue. \"And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain\" (Mark 7:35).\n\nAnother Meal in the Desert\n\nOn this trip Jesus again fed a large group of people—four thousand men, besides the women and children. These people were hungry and away from home. The disciples had only seven loaves and a few little fishes but the people were fed abundantly, as in the case of the prior miracle. (Read Matt. 15:32-38.)\n\nAgain Beset by Sign-Seekers\n\nWhen he could not find seclusion elsewhere, the Lord took his disciples for another trip on the Sea of Galilee and gave them some profound instructions. He warned them against the false attitude and doctrines of the Pharisees and Sadducees. These two ordinarily discordant parties were united in their opposition to the truth. So often that is found. The most frequent trick of the adversary is to ask for a sign. When these wicked people asked Jesus for a sign he refused with a sharp rebuke: \"A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas\" (Matt. 16:1-4).\n\n\"Thou Art the Christ\"\n\nThe writer of these lessons has purposely cut short the consideration of other topics in this chapter to give somewhat detailed study to one particular incident recorded in chapter 16 of Matthew. \"When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?\" Mark well the question which was really the subject of the conversation. He wanted them to know once and for all who he was. They reported to him the rumors, \"Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.\" The people seemed to have no intimation that he was the Messiah. In the eyes of the people he had not measured up to their expectations of a great deliverer and king. To many, signs had been given, but he had rejected their offer to crown him king of Israel.\n\nThen to the Twelve, to whom had been given special training and preparation, he propounded the question, \"But whom say ye that I am?\" Peter answered for the group, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" That was a solemn testimony—a positive knowledge. \"And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.\" Then Jesus added, \"And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it\" (Matt. 16:13-18).\n\nDid he mean that he was going to build his church upon Peter or any other man? The Lord was referring to his own Church. Was it then to be given to a man? No, that would make it man's church. \"Through direct revelation from God, Peter knew that Jesus was the Christ; and upon revelation, as a rock of secure foundation, the Church of Christ was to be built.\" A Church built upon that revelation is secure as a rock and the powers or \"gates of hell\" can never prevail against it as long as it is so led and guided. With due respect, any church built upon Peter would be Peter's church and not the Church of Jesus Christ. By revelation alone can his Church be builded and maintained.\n\nReference is made to Matthew 16:19. \"And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\" These keys were authority to act for God. They were given to the Twelve Apostles. What church upon the earth today claims authority for its presidency and apostleship to bind on earth and it shall be bound in heaven? Did the Lord give useless keys that were not to be used? The answer can only be given in the negative. To the Church of Jesus Christ in this day have been given the same keys of authority as are being used almost every day in the temples of God.\n\nQuestions and Suggestions\n\nDiscussion\n1.

Wayne Driggs\n\nFor Tuesday, March 1, 1949\nObjective: To emphasize that the allurements of the world do not provide lasting happiness.\n\nNo man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other\" (Matthew 6:24). In this statement, from the Sermon on the Mount, our Savior was warning against setting our hearts too much upon material wealth and worldly possessions. \"For,\" he declared, \"where your treasure is, there will your heart be also\" (Matt. 6:21). Does this mean that we must forego pleasure in the good things of earth? No, for we are told that:...\n\nThe earth is man's and the fulness thereof... Yea, all things which come of the earth, in the season thereof, are made for the benefit and the use of man, both to please the eye and to gladden the heart; yea, for food and for raiment... And it pleaseth God that he hath given all these things unto man; for unto this end were they made to be used, with judgment, not to excess (D. & C. 59:18-20).\n\nNote those concluding words: \"to be used with judgment, not to excess.\" Is ours not an age of excess? As the poet Wordsworth phrased it, \"The world is too much with us; late and soon, getting and spending, we lay waste our powers.\" If we are not careful, the worldly attractions in life can become so all-absorbing that we may fill our days with things of little worth. At such times we are in danger of losing the power to discern what constitutes true values.\n\nIn seeking to gain more and more of material things we are apt to become covetous. Against this sin the Savior warned: \"Take heed, and be ware of covetousness; for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth\" (Luke 12:15). Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal (Matt. 6:19-20).\n\n\"Ye cannot serve God and mammon\" (Matthew 6:24).\n\nNatin WE PRAY Evelyn Fjeldsted\n\nWe pray not for the downfall of a sovereign or a goal,\n\nWe pray only that the light of truth\n\nMay come to every soul.\n\nLESSON DEPARTMENT:. 847 Work Meeting Sewing\n(A Course for Optional Use by Wards and Branches at Work Meeting)\n\nLesson 6 Blouses and Slips\n\nJean Ridges Jennings\n\nFor Tuesday, March 8, 1949\n\nWe mentioned in a previous lesson that men wear out shirts in strategic points long before the whole of the article has passed its usefulness. The same thing is true of women's blouses. They get generally shabby or the sleeves pull out. But the front section, which is the attractive part of the blouse, outlasts the garment as a whole. We also find this is often true of nice lingerie. The part that takes the rub goes, and we often have the embroidery and ruffles left in good condition.\n\nNeckline accessories may be made from the odds and ends cut away from old blouses and lingerie. The smallest bit of lace can be renewed by squeezing it in soap suds, rinsing well and wrapping it, while wet, around a glass or bottle, pressing it out to full dimensions with the fingers and allowing it to dry and stiffen.\n\nIf necessary small pieces may be joined carefully by hand, following the pattern of the lace so the join will not show. These may then be used as edgings for collars or cuffs or inserts on collars or vestees.\n\nUsable collar and cuffs or collar and vestee sets may be made from the good parts of blouses and trimmed with refurbished pieces of lace or embroidery. Collars can be cut to follow the neckline of the dress and the designs varied into square or rounded styles.\n\nThe front of an old blouse might be used intact as a vestee by cutting away underarm sections and sleeves, binding or hemming the edges, and holding it around the waistline with a tape sewed to the binding.\n\nPieces of ruffling or embroidery could be very ingeniously used as bows, ruffles or rosettes to be placed at the side of a neckline or elsewhere as lingerie touches to brighten up a drab dress. Oftentimes blouses that have been discarded by a grownup can be cut down into smaller sizes for young girls, thus eliminating the worn parts under the arms and around the sleeves, but still giving service.\n\nIn many cases there will be plenty of good material that can be salvaged from a slip when it is worn out as far as adult use is concerned to make a small girl a good serviceable slip. Add a touch of beading at the top of the ruffle with a ribbon drawn through it and a tiny bow, and the \"small fry\" who falls heir to it will be proud as a peacock.\n\nAlso, the good parts of these nice slips could easily be made into panties to be worn for \"Sunday best\" by the younger generation.\n\nLiterature of the Gospel Restoration Lesson 6 Lyric Expression of the Restoration Elder Howard R. Driggs\n\nFor Tuesday, March 15, 1949\n\nA truly religious song is an overflow of the soul. When the heart gets \"so full that a drop over fills it,\" lyric expression affords emotional relief. Singing has therefore ever been, except with extremely Puritan-minded folk, closely linked with religion.\n\nThe children of Israel let out their hearts in song. Thus came their soulful psalms and other lyrics. In later years when Christianity was first being spread among the folk of Europe, the carols, vibrant with love for the Savior, were created to bring continuing joy and uplift for all.\n\nThe psalms and carols may be called lyrics because they are an outpouring of great emotion—of praise and thanksgiving. The lyric is a poem which has the quality of music. It is a \"form of musical utterance in words governed by emotion and set free by a harmonious rhythm.\"\n\nDidactic poetry differs, in that it is instructive in nature or teaches a moral lesson.\n\nLyric poetry as distinguished from either didactic, epic, or dramatic, is expressive of the poet's feelings rather than of outward incident or events. There are certain laws of lyric form. One of them is the law of brevity. It is impossible to keep the lyric pitch for very long. The rapture turns to pain.\n\nThere is also the law of unity. Too, the lyric vocabulary should not seem studied or consciously ornate for that breaks the law of spontaneity.\n\nNaturally, with the spiritual rejoicing inspired by the restoration, the impulse was to sing praises to the Lord.\n\nOur Prophet was even given a revelation voicing divine approval of such lyric expression, in these beautiful words: \"For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads.\" In the same revelation the Prophet's wife, Emma, was assigned the \"selection of sacred hymns, as it shall be given thee, which is pleasing unto me, to be had in my church.\" With such heavenly sanction and guidance at the beginning, the Latter-day Saints were encouraged in making song and music an intrinsic part of their worship. At the outset, of course, there were no songs written by members of the Church. They could use only those created by others in accord with the spirit of the restored gospel. Within a few years, however, springing largely out of the missionary work, songs began to appear, a few of them set to music of earlier creation. Some of the hymns of high nonsectarian cast were found inspiring and helpful, and adopted. Some of these which are still sung are: \"O God, Our Help\" (From the Wesley Collection); \"God Moves in a Mysterious Way,\" by Cowper; \"Joy to the World,\" and \"Sweet Is the Work,\" by Isaac Watts. Lyric lines from such hymns are akin to the psalms in soul-lifting quality.\n\nTo illustrate: O God, our help in ages past, Our hope for years to come, Our shelter from the stormy blast, And our eternal home. God moves in a mysterious way, His wonders to perform; He plants his footsteps in the sea, And rides upon the storm.\n\nNote the majesty and strength in these simple lines, just given. Feel also the spiritual lift of the following lines: Joy to the world! The Lord will come And earth receive her King: Let every heart prepare Him room, And saints and angels sing. Latter-day Saints, in common with other God-loving folk, could sing with responsive hearts such songs.\n\nThere was need, however, for something even closer to the meaning and spirit of the newly restored gospel for the satisfaction of their inmost need. Nor was this something long in coming. Again we turn to Parley P. Pratt as a pioneer in the creation of distinctively Latter-day Saint hymns. In his Voice of Warning, which, as has been said, is poetic prose, he occasionally would express his thoughts in verse, as he did at the opening of his section on the Book of Mormon: Lo! From the opening heavens, in bright array, An angel comes—to earth he bends his way; Reveals to man, in power, as at the first, The fulness of the Gospel long since lost.\n\nIt was not long before this missionary poet was also creating hymns of classic cast—songs still dear to our people, and often sung. They are vibrant with the spirit of the restoration—and filled with truth. For example: The morning breaks, the shadows flee; Lo! Zion's standard is unfurled, The dawning of a brighter day Majestic rises on the world.\n\nThe above stirring lines and others in the hymn, set to music by another master, George Careless, as well as those that follow from the inspired pen of Parley P. Pratt, rank with the finest of religious lyrics: Come, O Thou King of Kings, We've waited long for thee, With healing in Thy wings, To set Thy people free.... Come, make an end to sin, And cleanse the earth by fire, And righteousness bring in, That saints may tune the lyre....\n\nNo need is here to quote at length from the songs which have become so much a part of us. Mere giving of an opening line will set a Latter-day Saint congregation ready to sing the hymns dear to our hearts. And sing they must to get the full beauty of the lyric lines. Singing is just a more beautiful way of reading. Through a song one lingers on expressive words.\n\nYet this also should be remembered: One can sing a song soulfully only when one can read the song aloud expressively. Try it.\n\nAs the epic rise of the Church continued, lyrics expressive of the emotional high points of the restoration naturally were created.\nMany songs are the heart throbs of history, created when feeling was high, or during ecstatic remembrance of stirring events. An example of the latter is the loved lyric, \"Joseph Smith's First Prayer,\" written in after years by George Manwaring.\n\nSweet sincerity, beautiful pictures, and an impressive message are in its rhythmic lines, a few of which follow:\nO how lovely was the morning Radiant beamed the sun above. Bees were humming, sweet birds singing, Music ringing through the grove. When within the shady woodland Joseph sought the God of love. Suddenly a light descended Brighter far than noon-day sun And a shining, glorious pillar O'er him fell, around him shone While appeared two heavenly beings, God the Father and the Son.\n\n\"An Angel from on High,\" of earlier creation, by Parley P. Pratt, sings of another event of deep significance, in such lines as these:\nAn angel from on high, the long, long silence broke; Descending from the sky These gracious words he spoke: \"Lo, in Cumorah's lonely hill, a Sacred record lies concealed; Sealed by Moroni's hand. It has for ages To wait the Lord's command. From dust to speak again.\n\nStill another, created by one of the great song writers of the Church, William W. Phelps, just after the martyrdom, keeps Joseph Smith in vivid, sacred remembrance, with flaming lyric lines, expressive of courage and prophetic. The opening stanza and the chorus of this classic song follow:\nPraise to the man who communed with Jehovah! Jesus anointed that Prophet and Seer, Blessed to open the last dispensation; Kings shall extol Him and nations revere. Hail to the Prophet, ascended to heaven! Traitors and tyrants now fight him in vain; Mingling with Gods, he can plan for his defense Death cannot conquer the hero again.\n\nAnother splendid hymn by William W. Phelps, vibrant with the spirit of the restoration, begins with these lifting lines:\nThe Spirit of God like a fire is burning! The latter-day glory begins to come forth; The visions and blessings of old are returning, And angels are coming to visit the earth. We'll sing and we'll shout with the armies Hosanna, hosanna to God and the Lamb. Let glory to them in the highest be given Henceforth and forever; amen and amen!\n\nReaders of this lesson will probably recognize that a dominant characteristic of these earlier expressions is a distinctive lyric quality. Little didacticism or sermonizing is in the lines. The lyrics mentioned above sing the gospel of the latter days. Its light and truth newly revealed brought joy and gladness. In them one feels the conviction of the poet in the reality that God lives and Jesus is the Christ.\n\nOut of the lengthened years of darkness, doubt, dissension among the multiplying creeds, God again had spoken; his Son Jesus Christ had come again in person to re-establish his work in purity, simplicity, and power on the earth. Those of poetic skill expressed these truths with fervor and devotion. In doing so they left us all a rich heritage of lyric literature.\nNor was it men alone who voiced with true emotion, with beauty and clarity, the feelings and thoughts that lifted their souls. Gifted women of the Church likewise created lyrics. Among these was Eliza R. Snow, whose life links with not only the period of the restoration but with the stirring years that followed. One of the most loved of her poems is \"O My Father—a prayer perfect—in its artistry of lyric expression.\" It carries also one of the sweetest, most divine tributes to mothers ever expressed.\n\nI had learned to call Thee Father, thro' Thy spirit from on high; But until the Key of Knowledge was restored, I knew not why. In the heav'ns are parents single? No; the thought makes reason stare. Truth is reason, truth eternal tells me I've a mother there. When I leave this frail existence, when I lay this mortal by, Father, Mother, may I meet you in your royal courts on high?\n\nThen, at length, when I've completed all Thou sent me forth to do, With your mutual approbation, let me come and dwell with you.\n\nHere is precious truth given under inspiration for not only Latter-day Saints but for all the world. In this brief study, we have been able only to open the door to treasures. It is hoped that those who participate in the lesson will be intrigued to search for and enjoy more of the songs that make the restoration live again.\n\nIndeed, the members of the Relief Society have been doing just this through the years. May the writer, with this closing word, pay tribute to those of this great organization who chose the Relief Society Songs. This hymnal, if such it may be called, contains a precious selection of uplifting religious lyrics. Congratulations also are due this splendid society for the forward-looking creation of the \"Singing Mothers.\" It is an inspirational example for all the world.\n\nStudies and Activities\n\n1. A.

Homer Durham\n\nFor Tuesday, March 22, 1949\n\nBy some of the early Church leaders.\n\nEVAN JENSEN\n\nThe doctrines of the Christian religion are the foundation stones of Latter-day Saint political thinking. Translated into the terminology of political philosophy, the following appear to be basic:\n\n1. The State and government are essential.\n2. The State must recognize man as a child of God and so respect human liberty. Religious freedom is not only essential to man's nature as a child of God, but is the means whereby eternal truth can be made available to men in society, who can then provide the basis for a healthy State and good government.\n\n4. The government of God is fundamentally limited in that it will not interfere with human liberty—on pain of ceasing to be Godly—and governments in their operations should recognize a similar limitation.\n\n5. The Constitution of the United States partakes of divine inspiration because it recognizes the above principle, and thus serves as a model for all governments.\n\nIn, through, and around these more or less basic postulates, are many rich expressions in the literature of Latter-day Saint political thought.\n\nSidney Rigdon (1793-1876)\n\nProminently identified with the rise of Mormonism was Sidney Rigdon. The \"Lectures on Faith,\" for many years printed in editions of the Doctrine and Covenants, constitute his principal contribution to Latter-day Saint literature. For notation here, however, attention is called to a discourse of July 4, 1838, at Far West, Missouri, sometimes styled by Joseph Smith as a Mormon \"declaration of independence.\" Copies of the speech were printed in pamphlet form and are today very rare. In 1941 a San Francisco bookseller was holding a copy for sale at $800.\n\nThe speech was uttered in the midst of the Missouri persecutions. It sets forth the right of resistance when liberty is infringed. The Latter-day Saint answer to the deep problem of political thought is thus suggested: When is violence, if ever, justified? Rigdon's statement is perhaps the most fiery, radical statement in Latter-day Saint thought and can only be understood in relation to the trials and sufferings of the driven, persecuted saints.\n\nRemember it then, all men. We will never be the aggressors; we will infringe on the rights of no people, but shall stand for our own until death...\n\nAnd the mob that comes on us to disturb us, there shall be between us and them a war of extermination... (Whitney's History of Utah, I, page 144; see B. H. Roberts, Missouri Persecutions, page 193, for a complete quotation).\n\nParley Parker Pratt (1807-1857)\n\nPerhaps one of the most romantic figures among the early saints, aside from Joseph Smith, was Parley Parker Pratt, who joined the Church in August 1830. In 1837, in vigorous prose, Pratt produced The Voice of Warning, probably Mormonism's oldest, most famous tract. Chapter three of this work is devoted to an enlarged explanation of the kingdom of God idea, viewing the restored Church as God's \"organized government on the earth.\" The Voice of Warning is easily available and excerpts from chapter three can readily be examined.\n\nBrigham Young (1800-1877) Brigham Young, that great empire builder whose stature grows with the years, has yet to be recognized, as he some day will be, for his deep philosophic insight. A beginning was made in 1937 when Professors Gabriel, Warfel, and Williams of Yale University included Brigham Young's views on government in their anthology, The American Mind. (See also Discourses of Brigham Young, chapter 31, \"Political Government.\" ) Quite outstanding among President Young's many statements bordering on the subject of political philosophy, is his discourse on \"The Kingdom of God,\" July 8, 1855. (Journal of Discourses II, 309-317). Here is the stated ideal of the great, tolerant, Christian world society towards which Church and State should strive in their \"co-ordinate\" capacity, and in which one need not be a Christian so long as he respects the rights of others. When the Kingdom of God is fully set up and established on the face of the earth... It will protect the people in the enjoyment of all their rights, no matter what they believe, what they profess, or what they worship. If they wish to worship a God of their own workmanship, instead of the true and living God, all right, if they will mind their own business and let other people alone... That Kingdom grows out of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but it is not the Church, for a man may be a legislator in that Body which will issue laws... And still not belong to the Church of Jesus Christ at all.\n\nJohn Taylor (1808-1887) The third president of the Church produced a work concerning which Hubert Howe Bancroft wrote: As a dissertation on a general and abstract subject, it probably has not its equal in point of ability within the whole range of Mormon literature (History of Utah, page 433). This was The Government of God (Liverpool: 1851). President Taylor faced some of the most severe political problems of the Church. Book Five of The Gospel Kingdom (pp. 297-349), published in 1943, contains the choice selections of his thought in many matters ranging from world problems, to the Latter-day Saint position with regard to the American nation, socialism, and other movements. In 1855, while publishing a weekly newspaper, The Mormon, in New York City, John Taylor wrote, for example, the following: We believe that our fathers were inspired to write the Constitution of the United States, and that it is an instrument, full, lucid, and comprehensive.... That it is the great bulwark of American liberty and that the strict and implicit observance of which is the only safeguard of this mighty nation. We believe that the president, governors, judges, and governmental officers ought to be respected, honored, and sustained in their stations but that they ought to use their positions and power, not for political emolument, or party purposes, but for the administration of justice, and equity, and for the well being and happiness of the people (The Gospel Kingdom, pp. 309-310).\n\nWilford Woodruff (1807-1898) President Wilford Woodruff inherited—and solved—the great political problems thrust on the Latter-day Saints during President Taylor's administration, many of them going back to 1830. In so doing, Latter-day Saint thought is indebted to President Woodruff for one of the most clarifying concepts we have concerning Church-State relationships and the problem of the \"kingdom of God\" therein. In answer to a public question, \"What is the Mormon idea of its rule as the Kingdom of God?\" President Woodruff replied, in harmony with the Latter-day Saint \"co-ordinate\" theory of fundamental limits—for human liberty's sake—on both Church and State: It is this: we hold that this Church was set up and organized by command of the Almighty; that it has the right to formulate and maintain rules of church discipline applying to its own members; that the extent of its punitive power is the excommunication of the transgressor; that it has no power to punish anyone by deprivation of life, liberty or property or personal injury in any form; that governments should not regulate the church, nor the church seek to control the state; that all men should be politically free and equal to vote as they please and to sustain what politics they please, so that they do not infringe on the rights of others (The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff, 1946, page 193. An important \"Official Declaration\" of December 12, 1889, pp. 193-195, preceded the above statement).\n\nThe presidents of the Church who have followed: Lorenzo Snow, Joseph F. Smith, Heber J. Grant, and George Albert Smith, have continued, with others, to expound and develop the Latter-day Saint contribution to the more adequate political theory that scholars, statesmen, and modern men seek. Problems of war, peace, labor relations, industrial strife, and social organization have all been discussed and gospel solutions therefor suggested by modern Church leaders.\n\nQuestions for Discussion 1. In America and England, the Society of Friends (or Quakers), have attracted world-wide attention because they refuse to bear arms. American and English law, accordingly, has recognized their rights as \"conscientious objectors\" to war. When, if ever, is the use of force justified? On what basis can Sidney Rigdon's address of July 4, 1838, be understood? The participation of thousands of boys and some girls belonging to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the armed services?\n\n2. Chapter 9, in President Heber J. Grant's book of compiled discourses, Gospel Standards, is entitled, \"Government and Public Affairs.\" Class leaders might examine this chapter as well as chapter 21, \"Political Government\" in the Discourses of Brigham Young for source material.\n\n3. Discuss Brigham Young's statement that a man may be a legislator in the kingdom of God \"and still not belong to the Church of Jesus Christ at all.\"\n\n4.

Edgar Lyon\nFor Tuesday, March 22, 1949\n\nThe Presidency a unit\nThe three ARE ONE\nGeorge QO. Cannon\nPresident John Taylor\n\nAt Milnthorpe, Westmoreland, England, on November 1, 1808, a child was born in humble surroundings whose influence as a stalwart defender of religious truth, was destined to be felt in Canada, the United States, and the continent of Europe before his life closed seventy-nine years later. John Taylor was his name and he became the third President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nBorn into a Church of England family, he was discontented with its theology and sought for more vital religion. When about fifteen years of age he joined the Methodist Church and was soon functioning as a local exhorter. About 1828 he emigrated to the New World and within a year John Taylor Joseph F. Smith or two had established himself in Toronto, Canada, as a local Methodist preacher. He was a wood turner and made his living at this trade.\n\nIt was not long, however, until he became dissatisfied with Methodism. He was an assiduous reader and had an analytical mind. His treading and thinking showed him how far Methodism was removed from the gospel of the New Testament Church, and so he withdrew from the Methodist organization, taking a large following with him, and formed with them a study group for the purpose of discovering the true Biblical teachings concerning the fundamentals of Christianity. They came to be known as \"Dissenters.\"\n\nAt this time a new sect known as the \"Irvingites\" was making LESSON DEPARTMENT claim that God had called a prophet and that the Primitive Church was again formed upon the earth. John Taylor was attracted to this movement but soon saw its inadequacy and withdrew from it, continuing his search for the true Church.\n\nIt was at this critical time in his life that Parley P. Pratt arrived in Toronto. He traveled as did the ancient apostles \"without purse or scrip,\" depending upon God to direct him to the honest in heart. Elder Pratt began holding meetings and among those who attended were John Taylor and his wife. \"John wrote down eight sermons which Apostle Pratt preached,\" says B. H. Roberts, \"and compared them with the scripture.\" He also investigated the evidences of the divine authenticity of the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants. \"I made a regular business of it for three weeks,\" John relates, \"and followed Brother Parley from place to place.\"\n\nThe result of this thorough investigation was that John Taylor and his wife, Leonora Cannon Taylor, were baptized on May 9, 1836, by Elder Pratt. Elder Taylor became a staunch supporter of the Prophet Joseph. He was called to the apostleship by revelation on July 8, 1838, and thus began a career of Church leadership that was to continue for forty-nine years.\n\n-At Nauvoo he was editor of the Church weekly, the Nauvoo Neighbor and also for a time of the monthly periodical Times and Seasons (a semi-monthly publication after the first year). In these capacities he became intimately associated with Joseph Smith and grew to love him with a bond that was stronger than any fear of death. He voluntarily accompanied Joseph Smith to Carthage jail and the Prophet's last hours in mortality, indeed his very last hour, were soothed and comforted by the tender and wholesome spirit and loving friendship of John Taylor.\n\nDuring the attack in which the Prophet lost his life, Elder Taylor received four musket balls in his body, one of which he carried with him to the grave. As a member of the Council of the Twelve he did extensive missionary work, opening Ireland, France, and Germany to the preaching of the gospel: and supervising the translation of the Book of Mormon into French and German.\n\nAt the death of Brigham Young in 1877, John Taylor was senior member of the Council of The Twelve and by virtue of this office, presided over the Church during the apostolic presidency which lasted until 1880. In October of the latter year the First Presidency was reorganized and he was sustained as President of the Church, with George Q. Cannon (whom he had converted in England in 1840) and Joseph F. Smith (later to become the sixth President of the Church) as his counselors. This Presidency served the Church until 1887.\n\nThis decade from 1877 to 1887 was a trying one, filled with a series of vexatious crusades and troublesome political struggles carried on by enemies of the Church against the Church in the Territory of Utah. The courage that President Taylor had manifested in the face of death in Carthage jail now guided him in his administration of Church affairs. In spite of the external pressure that WINTER TERM begins Monday, January 3\n\nThere is a continued strong demand for trained office workers.
