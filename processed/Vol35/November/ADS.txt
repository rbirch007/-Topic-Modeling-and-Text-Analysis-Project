From Near and Far
Sadie Ollerton Clark, author of "Then � � and Now," is the wife of Leigh W. Clark, Houston, Texas. She is the mother of three sons and president of the Houston Branch Relief Society. She began writing while attending Brigham Young University. Her literary work is distinguished by clarity and beauty of language and a deep insight into character and personality. Many of our readers will recall with pleasure her delightful pioneer poem "To My Mother" which was awarded first honorable mention in the Eliza R. Snow Poem Contest in 1936.
Mrs. Clark and her husband have been active leaders in several wards and branches of the Church — including Mesa (Arizona), Albuquerque (New Mexico), and El Paso (Texas), where they have welcomed many missionaries and converts to the Church.

I appreciate having The Relief Society Magazine for a year so that I might know more about the Mormon faith and its many fine works.
Mildred Chatfield Smith, Watertown, Mass.

I enjoy my work in contacting the women (as Magazine representative) and find that the Magazine sells itself. Also I enjoy it for it fills all my needs.
Emma J. Lines, Duncan, Arizona.

Enclosed find check for the coming year's subscription to the Magazine. We can't do without it in our home.
I want to express my sincere thanks to Carol Read Flake for her excellent story "Sudden Storm" in the September issue. May she write more stories of this high caliber.
Success to you and all your helpers on this our own ladies' Magazine.
Frances Yost, Bancroft, Idaho.

I find The Relief Society Magazine a great help and inspiration in my missionary work and I want it for myself even though I am a man. I heartily recommend it to all missionaries.
Elder Frank Harold Wing, Louisville, Kentucky.

You may be interested to know that I visited several of the families that I have been sending the Magazine to. They are all non-members, and each one praised the Magazine very highly, saying they passed it on to friends and relatives when they had finished reading it. It was the means of a good many interesting gospel conversations.
Una McDonald, Las Vegas, Nevada.

"The Visitors" by Fay Tarlock (March 1948) is a fascinating story. It reveals unusual ability to portray human behavior patterns truthfully and entertainingly. To my delight I find no flaws in her portrayals, no confusion of traits, not one tiny slip out of character, and I knew intimately the two dear women she describes so charmingly.
I predict for Mrs. Tarlock a brilliant career in the realm of homey stories.
Estelle Neff Caldwell, Los Angeles, California.

The sisters here in Glasgow (Scotland) appreciate the Relief Society Magazine and send their best wishes for its continued success.
Ellen Martin.

The current feature in the Relief Society Magazine, "The Russells Did Not Go to Church," (August, September, and October) is unusually good.
Fay Tarlock, Danville, California.

I love our Magazine and would not think of being without it. You are doing a grand work.
Irene K. Read, Boise, Idaho.

I am eighty years old and I have always enjoyed The Relief Society Magazine. Success for the Magazine.
Marietta S. Porter, Myton, Utah.

We did so much enjoy the fine story in the September issue of The Relief Society Magazine, "Learn of Love" by Rosa Lee Lloyd.
Elsie Jack, Salt Lake City, Utah.
