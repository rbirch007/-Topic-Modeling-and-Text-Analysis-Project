And what of the Promise? Counselor Marianne C. Sharp (Address delivered at the morning session of the Annual General Relief Society Conference, September 30, 1948)

Sister Spafford has asked me, as chairman of the Relief Society Building Fund Committee, to give a report on the Building Fund. You sisters who are here today, representing the more than 111,000 Relief Society members throughout the world, have come rejoicing to commemorate the conclusion of the fund-raising program to erect a Relief Society Building. Just a year ago lacking two days, the Relief Society sisters assembled at the 1947 annual general Relief Society conference voted to raise a vast sum of money for the purpose of erecting a Relief Society building. You will recall that the plan provided that all Relief Society stake boards donate one half of their stake board funds on hand as of December 1946, and that every stake, in addition, be responsible for $5 for every enrolled member as of December 1946. Provision was also made to have Relief Society members and friends donate Special and Memorial Gifts, as they might desire, and the missions of the Church, except the European missions, were invited to take part in the financing program according to quotas to be set by their respective Relief Society mission presidents in consultation with the mission presidents. It was hoped that these amounts, when added together, would make up a grand total of $500,000 or half a million.
To raise such a vast sum of money in one year was an undertaking which to some seemed well-nigh impossible and to others not even advisable. But the program had the full approval of the First Presidency, and right after the October conference the funds began slowly to come in. To reach the true objective it was not only necessary that the money be raised, but it was essential that the giving be done in a spirit of love so that blessings might be poured out upon the sisters. From the expressions which have accompanied the remittances, it seems certain that the sisters throughout the world have earned the blessings of the Lord and that they have been bound together in closer bonds of sisterhood.
As one sister wrote who lived far away from any organized Relief Society: "In my heart the quota would never be complete if my share was missing."
There have been numberless Memorial Gifts made to honor dear, faithful Relief Society workers of both the past and present. Recently the Florida Stake Relief Society expressed the spirit of the Memorial Gifts when they wrote:
This money is to be applied as a Memorial offering to honor our beloved leaders, Brother and Sister Charles A. Callis. It is a pleasure for us to do this as we feel that our roll could never be complete without its being headed by the names of two of our leaders who have given of themselves so unselfishly to the building up of the Father's kingdom in Page 727 the South.
We know that the lives of these two people stand as a living memorial and will always be indelible on the minds of the people of the South. Truly the spirit of this undertaking has been pleasing to our Father in heaven.

We report to you now the expenses which have been incurred to date incident to raising the money. All figures used throughout will be in even dollars.

Before the beginning of the fundraising, it was the earnest desire of the general board that it might provide some revenue to meet such necessary expenses. A few years ago one of the General Authorities wrote a series of articles for TheLater the general board desired to issue the articles in book form as a reference. He consented but requested that the royalties go to Relief Society. The earnings were earmarked to meet any necessary expenses incidental to raising the Building Fund.

When the entire edition is sold, the royalties will be sufficient to meet all the expenses just reported. We know you likewise are happy that each dollar you contribute will go into the building. WE feel very humble and at the same time very proud to report now the amount of money which you and thousands of sisters whom you represent have raised to erect a Relief Society Building. 

We know that long hours and arduous toil have been necessary to accomplish the achievement you have made. The stake board quota of $35,483 has been paid in full, and it is with deep gratitude that we report that every stake in the Church has been recognized here today. Contribution quotas "of stakes amounting to $443,885 have been paid, and in addition Special and Memorial Gifts amounting to $10,028 making a grand total from the stakes of the Church of $449,396. 

Ere and Memorial Gifts made directly to the general board have ranged from gifts of $1 to one gift of $10,000, and from these gifts has come an additional sum of $12,482. Our hearts have been continually touched by the spirit of the sisters in the missions. From those who have no places of their own in which to meet, no chairs even on which to sit, no tables at which to work, has come an outpouring of offerings which made us who have plenty feel humble indeed.

We are proud to report that the money contributed by the sisters of $43,927 has been advised by the Presiding Bishopric that the amount of money �$8,000�which Relief Society sisters years ago donated to erect a woman's building, is being turned to Relief Society. For this we are indeed grateful, for now the money raised by those dear sisters of long ago will really become stone and mortar in the building for which they worked and dreamed.

AND WHAT OF THE PROMISE?

Our hearts rejoice to give now the grand total of money given to the Relief Society Building Fund, an amount of $554,516. 

WITH deepest gratitude and thanksgiving we report that the First Presidency have informed us that they will give to us a site on which to erect the building, and that the choosing of the proper site is under consideration at the present time. They have assured us that they want us to have the right neighbors and ample space for our beautiful building. They have instructed Sister Spafford to go ahead at once to perfect our building plans, as they feel that the Relief Society Building is urgently needed. As soon as the First Presidency designate the site you may be sure the general board will at once inform you, and it is our earnest expectation that before too long you will be able to enter the building which you will have made possible.

The generosity of the General Authorities to the women of the Church I am sure brings joy to your hearts as it does to the hearts of the general board members. 

In contemplating the work of Relief Society we always praise and emulate the work of the sisters of the past. In viewing this stupendous accomplishment of Relief Society today, I feel certain that the sisters of the future have been given just cause to admire and emulate your example.

I feel that once again, as over the years, the sisters have demonstrated their love and their faithfulness and are worthy to have been given by divine revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith that greatest blessing the Relief Society�through which the sisters of the Church render service to the Church and make individual progress on the eternal path to the celestial kingdom.

One year ago President Spafford said to us, "We must not fail." With thanksgiving we say to her at this time, we have not failed, but have succeeded gloriously beyond our greatest expectations. You have been the instruments by which that great dream of the women of the past will become reality. Through your unselfish giving the dream of the past has become the sure promise of the morrow. For your vision and faithfulness I pray that the blessings of our Heavenly Father may continue to be poured out upon you and on all other Relief Society sisters found over the world this day.

THE BUILDING FUND

Nellie W. Neal
I can't think all the building will be in wood and stone,
When we erect the edifice we've come to call our own,
Because, as I've been giving to help attain our goal,
I've felt a growth within myself, expanding heart and soul.
