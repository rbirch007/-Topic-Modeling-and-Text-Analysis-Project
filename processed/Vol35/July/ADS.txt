In these lessons the term State is commonly used to indicate an independent sovereign state (nation). Note: A lesson is outlined for Tuesday, February 22, 1949, since some Relief Societies hold their meetings on days other than Tuesday. It is suggested that Relief Societies which meet on Tuesday present the February 22 social science lesson on March 22 and the March 22 lesson on the fifth Tuesday, March 29, or combine the February and March social science lessons and present them together on March 22. The titles and objectives of the lessons follow: Lesson 1. The Meaning and Importance of Political Doctrines Objective: To point out the modern tendencies in political thought to ignore spiritual resources and to seek a cure-all through unlimited government. Lesson 2. Some Political Doctrines of the Book of Mormon Objective: To learn, from a study of political doctrines expressed in the Book of Mormon, that a government to be good must be composed of good people. Lesson 3. Political Ideas Advocated by the Prophet Joseph Smith Objective: To better appreciate the political doctrines advanced by the Prophet Joseph Smith. Lesson 4. "The Declaration of Belief Regarding Governments and Laws in General" Objective: To study section 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants as the belief of Latter-day Saints in regard to earthly governments and laws in general. Lesson 5. Main Currents in Latter-day Saint Political Thought as Revealed in Discourse and Literature Objective: To appreciate the contributions to political thought voiced by some of the early Church leaders. Lesson 6. Contemporary Domestic Problems Objective: To recognize the limitations of the State in its ability to solve problems. Lesson 7. International Strife and the Quest for Peace Objective: To appreciate the part some Latter-day Saints have taken in recent political activities and the obligation resting on Latter-day Saints to teach their children the doctrines of free agency and liberty in harmony with Latter-day Saint knowledge. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JULY 1948 Lesson 1-The Meaning and Importance of Political Doctrines Elder G. Homer Durham For Tuesday, October 26, 1948 Evan Jensen The watchword of traffic safety is courtesy." This slogan appeared at the crossing of a busy intersection recently. The thought behind it appears trite at first. On closer examination we see the modern social problem in a nutshell. Man's material development has outrun his spiritual. Take the example of traffic, which kills and maims someone every minute. How do we try to solve this problem? Largely by car inspections, superdivided highways, and other materialistic means. This is why the sign, "The watchword of traffic safety is courtesy," caught my eye. We must mobilize our spiritual resources! Which would you rather face, head-on, in oncoming traffic, a driver in a jolopy, with courtesy extending from him to you; or, a discourteous, ribald person in a thirty-ton truck? Objective: To point out the modern tendencies in political thought to ignore spiritual resources and to seek a cure-all through unlimited government. And-trailer engineering marvel? Or vice-versa? If safety and courtesy are desired on the highway, what about courtesy in the use of battleships and bombs? Predominance of the Material Over the Spiritual Just as the modern approach to most problems emphasizes materiality over the spiritual resources of man, so does the modern State and its government exemplify a similar triumph. In case of conflict between two nations the questions usually asked are (1) What are their resources, especially, coal, iron, and petroleum? (2) What is their industrial production and capacity? (3) What is their population and birthrate? Resort is then made to force. The spiritual qualities of the two peoples concerned, their capacity at tolerance, forbearance, and compromise are rarely considered or utilized. Rather they are exploited, devilishly, in support of the material factors in the contest. Mankind's spiritual and material needs cannot be separated. But the emphasis given these aspects of human living should definitely subordinate the material to spiritual ends by spiritually motivated means, and not in reverse order. LESSON DEPARTMENT Increase in Material Functions of Government Today the material functions of modern government outstrip all others. Men have come to rely more on the State for "salvation," bread, security from hunger, disease, cold, atomic bombs, and the effects of their own indiscretions, than on any other thing. Accordingly, men search for adequate doctrines both to guide the State and to judge its operations as "the way out." These doctrines, more and more, reflect a totalitarian approach; namely, that the effective solution lies through governmental action, therefore all other possible means must be subordinated, if not absorbed, by the State. What is the nature of the State? What are its limitations? What is the sphere of effective State action? How should governments be run and controlled? This is the age of politics and political problems. What contribution does Latter-day Saint thought make in answer to these questions? What is the gospel, viewed in relation to these problems, and what are the gospel applications? Is there a "true" or better way of running governments as there is a "true" way of baptism and administering the sacrament of the Lord's supper? Or is the effective reach of the gospel confined to a few simple ordinances and individualistic beliefs having no connection with the War Assets Administration, British loans, the Politburo*, or revolution in Indonesia? A consideration of these and allied subjects will form the basis for this year's course of study. Contributions of the Past From the Greek world we derive one of the great political ideas of all time, limited government, meaning that government should be confined to set limits in order that power (which tends to be arbitrary) can be controlled for man's benefit. The Constitution of the United States is perhaps the world's greatest fulfillment of this idea. It confines government to certain channels, and forbids it to enter others (for example, those freedoms protected by the Bill of Rights).

Moreover, taught Aristotle, even limited power should be divided, with checks and balances—“mixed government”—in order to achieve political stability. Otherwise men are subordinated to the will of their rulers with the result that men serve the State rather than the State serving man. The President of the United States, for example, must have authorization from Congress in the form of a law before, normally, he can act. Then the courts may review any executive procedure thereunder. Expounded first by Aristotle, these general ideas are the foundation of constitution-making and constitutional government.

The Roman world, though absolutist, nevertheless carried through an idea which moderns speak of as “the rule of law,” namely, that State action must conform to law. Too often among the Romans, law could be the whim of the emperor.

The inner executive committee or controlling body of the Russian Communist Party, and the bureau of foreign Communist propaganda, 492

But by English times, the Greek and Roman doctrines had merged to recognize that good law, while conforming to natural or divine principles, must yet be agreed upon—in advance—by the people. Thus, twin ideas, limited government and government by consent of the governed, became the modern inheritance. Both are expressed in the Constitution of the United States.

The Crisis in Recent Political Thought

As inventions have multiplied, men, particularly since about 1870, have turned to the State to regulate, control, and now—plan the results accruing from the concentration of population in big cities and other revolutionary changes. Using the doctrine of “government by consent,” the people have gained control of their governments. Then they have asked (spurred on, many times, by scheming men) their governments to do this, then that, then the other thing, until the National Government of the United States alone has been looked to, not only by most Americans, but by peoples in Europe and Asia, as the means of solving all problems. So, State functions have increased enormously, not to mention the influence of socialistic doctrines.

What has happened to “limited government”? It appears to have become instead, by means of man’s resorting to the State, a doctrine of unlimited or total government! Can we have unlimited government and preserve the human rights, so precious to the advocates down the centuries, of limited government? Human experience teaches us differently. This is the crisis of modern political thought.

The Need for Nurturing Spiritual Attitudes

Within this crisis congregate the problems of modern society because our many social institutions have become so enmeshed in the machinery of the State that any break-up of government threatens to dissolve society. To alleviate this situation, there is powerful need for spiritual attitudes: courtesy, kindliness, forbearance, tolerance, mutual understanding, faith in God and in each other.

Such social institutions as the family, business corporations, labor unions, professional societies, farm bureaus, trade associations have—in the spirit of the times—come to rely more and more on government to settle and support their affairs. Juvenile delinquency, adult delinquency, divorce, broken homes, industrial strife—all too often we seek remedies through passing laws, setting up agencies and bureaus, when what is also needed is a nurturing of man’s fundamental religious nature.

Divorce involves two holy beings, a man and a woman. The juvenile delinquent, the striking miner, the recalcitrant employer, all are children of God, with deep wellsprings of spiritual power. What is being done to keep this power alive and functioning? If the forces of materialism through the unlimited State come to dominate our lives completely, what forces can then be free to operate in the effort to fulfill the great spiritual needs of men?

The State may try, often in a totalitarian way, as in Hitler’s Germany. But man is of such diverse outlook that spiritual freedom is perhaps his most precious freedom. So again, here is the crisis of modern politics and of modern thought.

What paths lead from this dilemma? This is the approach we seek.

Questions for Discussion

1. What is meant by “limited government”?

2. Does the doctrine of “limited government” imply that there are limits on “freedom” as well as on government? For example: Can society tolerate absolute freedom? Can a person, or group, do anything he pleases or must persons and groups accept certain responsibilities?

3. A main problem of government is to maintain the balance between freedom and authority. What are some of the limitations on personal freedom that might be considered desirable?

4. What are some possible limitations on personal freedom that might be considered undesirable?

5. What important human problems can you think of that governments must, of necessity and with satisfaction, solve?

6. Can you think of some human problems that cannot effectively be solved by governmental action?

7. How does governmental action differ from other forms of organized human activity? Does it differ in any respect? Why or why not?

Optional Lessons in the Field of Social Science—The First Presidencies (Primarily for use outside Continental United States and its possessions)

THE PRESIDENCY A UNIT

THE THREE ARE ONE Elder T. Edgar Lyon

Preview of Lessons for 1948-49 OUR course of lessons for this and the ensuing year is to be devoted to a study of the First Presidencies that have guided the destiny, under the hand of God, of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

These men were strong men, men of faith, men possessed of leadership ability and determined that God’s work should be foremost in their lives. Two or three of the early leaders were not strong enough to withstand the persecutions they were called to endure, nor were they unselfish enough to lose all for the gospel, and they became critical of the Prophet, estranged from the saints and lost their influence with the people. They were replaced in their positions of authority by stronger and more faithful men.

But while they remained true, they were instruments in the hand of the Lord in furthering his work. One of the unique features of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is its plan of lay-leadership. Just as in the days of the Apostolic Church its leaders were drawn from men who made their livelihood from the various occupations of the day. Some continued to pursue their vocations along with their Church work until the end of their mortal administrations.

It was to be a Church of its people—in which the members could be mutually helpful in working out their salvation. The Lord’s Church, however, demands centralized guidance and a regulation of the Priesthood authority, divinely restored to the earth, otherwise the very power of its democracy and lay-leadership would lead to schisms that would destroy it.

So the Lord established by revelation presiding quorums through which is given divine guidance for the Church in all its activities both spiritual and temporal. Foremost among these presiding quorums is that of the First Presidency of the Church. The President of this quorum is defined in the Doctrine and Covenants as the “... pre-siding High Priest over the High Priesthood of the Church” (107: 66).

Prior to the organization of the Church, John the Baptist instructed Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery (May 1829) that they should be called respectively the first and second elders of the Church (D.H.C. (1, 40-41). The Prophet Joseph was President of the Church from April 6, 1830 to the day of his death. It was in November, 1832, that a First Presidency of the Melchizedek Priesthood was announced (D&C 68:15). But it was not until March of the following year that Joseph Smith was called by revelation to this Presidency (D&C 81:1-3). A month or so later (April 1832) at a conference held in Missouri, he was acknowledged President of the High Priesthood of the Church. Sometime in March, 1832, Frederick G. Williams was designated by revelation (D&C 81:1) to be a counselor to Joseph Smith; but it was nearly a year thereafter, March 18, 1833, when a Council of the First Presidency was fully organized, Sidney Rigdon and Frederick G. Williams being set apart as Joseph's counselors. It will thus be seen that it was nearly three years from the organization of the Church before the highest Council was fully developed and completed (Widtsoe, John A., Priesthood and Church Government, pp. 258-259). The Prophet Joseph presided over the Church by virtue of his presidency over the High Priesthood of the Church and his ordination to that office. Each succeeding president has functioned by these same powers, assisted by counselors of his own choosing. Because the presidency has acted as a unit in its administrative functions, the counselors have not become known for their individual contributions to the Church. It is hoped that these lessons can point out some of the vital things they contributed to the welfare of the Church. A study of the contributions that these Church leaders have made to the Church should make us more appreciative of our religious heritage and cause us to prize our gospel teaching and its opportunities more than we commonly do. It is not the intention in these articles to give a complete biographical sketch of the life of each person studied. These can be found in convenient form elsewhere. Our intention is to stress their characters, their special talents and strengths in meeting the needs of their times, and the contributions that they made to Church growth and stability.

Lesson -1: Presidency of the Prophet Joseph Smith Elder T. Edgar Lyon For Tuesday, October 26, 1948 President Joseph Smith JOSEPH SMITH WHEN Joseph Smith was born at Sharon, Vermont, on December 23, 1805, a life had commenced that was ultimately to influence the course of millions of lives in all portions of the world. The family came from New England stock who had emigrated to America from England in 1638. Joseph Smith's parents were devout believers in the Savior and his atoning work as related in the New Testament. When, in the spring of 1820, an attempt was made by the three popular churches of the American frontier—the Methodist, Presbyterian, and Baptist faiths—to get the settlers in the vicinity where the Smiths resided interested in joining one of their churches, Joseph's mind was, as he expressed it, "called up to serious reflection and great uneasiness." The zealous proponents of organized religion were insisting that religious truths could be gained from three sources: first, from the Bible; second, from the writing of the early Christian fathers and church councils; and third, by human reasoning, based on the Bible and a study of historic Christianity. Joseph Smith was not a trained religious scholar, nor was he acquainted with the history, documents, and traditions of the Christian world, hence these channels were not open to him. His approach to the problem of finding religious truth was characterized by a child-like faith. Just as great pioneers in science and education have cast traditional beliefs and practices aside and undertaken experimental research to discover truth, he subjected his religious perplexity to objective experimentation. He resorted to the method of God's anointed leaders in the early days of the Christian Church, namely, prayer and guidance through revelation. In his own words: In the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said to myself: What is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be right, which is it, and how shall I know it? While I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the contests of these parties of religionists, I was one day reading the Epistle of James, first chapter and fifth verse, which reads: If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did; for how to act I did not know, and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had, I would never know; for the teachers of religion of the different sects understood the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible. At length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in darkness and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of God. I at length came to the determination to "ask of God," concluding that if he gave wisdom to them that lacked wisdom, and would give liberally, and not upbraid, I might venture (Pearl of Great Price, Joseph Smith 2:10-13). Unlike other religious founders, Joseph Smith was not a member of an already existing sect that he sought to reform. Neither did he lead a group of followers out of a church to form the nucleus of an apostate faction. Nor did he deliberately start out to found a new church, with preconceived notions about its theological teachings. He was commissioned, by the Father to bring to an apostate world the gospel of Jesus Christ, through the restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ in its original form.

As mentioned in the Preview, the Lord decreed that His kingdom on earth should be directed by a First Presidency. During the fourteen years that He presided over the Church, Joseph Smith had the assistance of counselors, four men at different times, serving in this capacity. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�JULY 1948

With them he directed the various activities of the Church and its members. One of the tasks that occupied part of the time of the First Presidency was the regulation of the temporal affairs of the Church and the welfare of those who embraced its teachings. In the financial difficulties and in the persecutions in Ohio, Jackson, Clay, and Caldwell counties in Missouri, and Nauvoo, the First Presidency assisted Church members and sacrificed and suffered with them.

Another duty that rested upon the First Presidency was that of directing the missionary activities of the Church. They directed the establishment and operation of the School of the Prophets, which was designed primarily to better equip missionaries and Church leaders for their responsibilities. During the administration of Joseph Smith, missionary work was commenced in the eastern, southern, New England, and mid-western states of the Union; in Canada, Great Britain, and in some of the islands of the Pacific; and Palestine was dedicated for the gathering of the Jews and the ultimate opening of that land to the missionary work of the restored gospel.

In one great work, however, Joseph Smith stood quite apart from his counselors. It was imperative that further revelations be received if the Gospel in its fullness as restored to earth should be understood. Joseph Smith, as Prophet, Seer, and Revelator met this need as an instrument in the hands of God and throughout his life continued to build up the body of theological principles through the revelations he received. These he interpreted in terms of daily religious living. It is due to his efforts in this respect that the Gospel came to be a way of living, rather than a way of believing only.

In addition to the restoration and the interpretation of the true purposes and meanings of the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel, Joseph Smith gave to the world the true form, power, organization, and purpose of the Church as an instrument in the hands of God to accomplish His purposes on earth. He revealed the great doctrine of salvation for the dead, without which the benefits of the Atonement of Christ become limited to those who were members of His Church on earth and are not available to those who die without a knowledge of Christ and His Gospel. The keys of the priesthood were again restored to earth. The eternity of the marriage covenant, and the concept of eternal progression were glorious truths received as a heritage from the revelations to the first President of the Church.

In spite of the high position and the keys he held and the great devotion of his numerous followers, Joseph Smith remained essentially a common man among common men. In 1844, Josiah Quincy described him in Nauvoo as one dressed in the "costume of a journeyman carpenter," but added: A fine-looking man, is what the passer-by would instinctively have murmured upon meeting the remarkable individual who had fashioned the mold which was to shape the feelings of so many thousands of his fellow mortals. But Smith was more than this, and one could not resist the impression that capacity and resource were natural to his stalwart person.

497

Comparing Joseph Smith to another interesting acquaintance, Mr. Quincy continues: Of all men I have met these two seemed best endowed with that kingly faculty which directs, as by intrinsic right, the feeble or confused souls who are looking for guidance... Both were of commanding appearance, men whom it seemed natural to obey (Josiah Quincy, Figures of The Past, pp. 321, 233).

HYRUM SMITH

Hyrum Smith No great man stands alone in his triumphs, and Joseph Smith had stalwart assistants upon whom he leaned for encouragement and support, and to whom he delegated part of the responsibility of the management of the growing Church. The one closest to him in this work was his brother Hyrum, who was his second counselor from November 7, 1837 until January 19, 1841, when he was sustained as Patriarch to the Church.

The literature of the world records some stories of great love that has existed between men. The Greeks had their account of Damon and Pythias; the Hebrews, the touching friendship of David and Jonathan; but in the love of Joseph and Hyrum for each other we have a love of brothers that stands out as a classic account of a love that was stronger than the fear of death. Joseph paid him this tribute: I could pray in my heart that all my brethren were like unto my beloved brother Hyrum, who possesses the mildness of a lamb, and the integrity of Job, and in short, the meekness and humility of Christ and I love him with that love that is stronger than death, for I never had occasion to rebuke him, nor he me.

Hyrum Smith was born February 9, 1800, at Tunbridge, Vermont, being nearly six years older than the Prophet. He was of a religious temperament, and although he had not affiliated himself with any church until he was twenty years of age, he had been reared with the New England religious concepts so that when the religious revival was instituted at Palmyra, New York, in the spring of 1820, he, his mother, a sister, and a brother joined the Presbyterian faith. This was in reality a return to the traditional family religion in New England.

However, when his younger brother Joseph reported his vision, Hyrum became his staunch supporter and all through the trying times never varied from his loyal devotion to his brother. There is a powerful evidence of the sincerity of Joseph Smith in this fact that he could convince his own brother and others in the family of the reality of his revelations.

Hyrum was baptized in Seneca Lake in June 1829, and became a persistent advocate of the new religious principles. He it was who first met Parley P. Pratt and converted him to the restored Gospel. A study of Church history reveals many other converts whose first acquaintance with the latter-day work came through a contact with Hyrum.

Hyrum was one of the eight witnesses to the divine authenticity of the Book of Mormon. Parley P. Pratt tells how much his first conversation with Hyrum influenced him. He wrote: He also unfolded to me the particulars of the discovery of the Book; its translation; the rise of the Church of Latter-day Saints, and the commission of his brother Joseph, and others, by revelation and the ministering of angels, by which the apostleship and authority had been again restored to the earth. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE�JULY 1948

After duly weighing the whole matter in my mind, I saw clearly that these things were true; and that myself and the whole world were without baptism, and without the ministry and ordinances of God; and that the whole world had been in this condition since the days that inspiration and revelation had ceased—in short, that this was a new dispensation or commission, in fulfilment of prophecy, and for the restoration of Israel, and to prepare the way before the second coming of the Lord (Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt, p. 39). When the Prophet and others were arrested at Far West, Missouri, late in October 1838, and incarcerated during the winter of 1838-39 in Liberty and other Missouri jails, Hyrum was one of those apprehended. Although he had many opportunities to escape, he refused to desert his brother Joseph. When Joseph Smith went to Carthage late in June 1844, to answer to charges growing out of the destruction of the Nauvoo Expositor, Hyrum insisted on going with him. He remained with his beloved brother by his own choice. Hyrum was killed shortly before the Prophet.

The epitaph, "In life they were not divided, and in death they were not separated!" (D&C 135:3) is a fitting tribute to Hyrum as well as to Joseph Smith.

Joseph. After the martyrdom, the Times and Seasons printed an editorial in which this was said of Hyrum: He lived so far beyond the ordinary walk of man that even the tongue of the vilest slanderer could not touch his reputation. He lived godly and he died godly. His greatest contribution to the Church is found in his stalwart support of his Prophet-brother. With him, he was so closely identified that it is almost impossible to discover wherein one acted apart from the other. In the midst of the Prophet's many trials and disappointments, often being deceived by those whom he trusted, God had given him one who stood firmly by him and from whom he gained strength.

At the time of Hyrum Smith's death, his son Joseph Fielding, born to his wife, Mary Fielding, was five years old. Joseph Fielding Smith later became the sixth president of the Church, presiding with great dignity and honor over the Church for which his father gave his life.

Topics for Study and Discussion

ox, they could have it. This seemed a miracle to these hungry people.

They used the meat sparingly and it lasted several weeks. With supplies low, and flour almost gone, they approached the Great Salt Lake alley.

The Johnston Army was held by the Federal Government at Fort Bridger during the winter of 1857, and it did not come towards Salt Lake until the spring of 1858, when it marched below town and traveled to Cedar Valley. Three of the young men of the Seventh Handcart Company were called to stand guard in Echo Canyon.

When the handcart Company was less than 100 miles from Salt Lake City, teams came to meet the people, bringing food and supplies, and cake and fruit for the sick and feeble. The courage and faith of these young people who walked all the way to the mountains and arrived in Salt Lake City, September 13, 1857, can never be excelled.

BEAUTY Caroline Eyring Miner Illusive as a columbine with wings, Half bird, half flower, in and out of sight, Fluttering green iridescent wings, as bright As air bejeweled with rain, now beauty weaves A mystic spell about me, for there clings To her the wild sweet longings from a night That I have lately known, the wondrous sight Of apple blossoms cradled in green leaves Freeing themselves and drifting like perfume, Pink purling, fragile, real as earth to me. So long as I can see the world abloom, See spring's fantastic flowered canopy, I shall know beauty that my heart will hold Against the winter when I shall be old.
