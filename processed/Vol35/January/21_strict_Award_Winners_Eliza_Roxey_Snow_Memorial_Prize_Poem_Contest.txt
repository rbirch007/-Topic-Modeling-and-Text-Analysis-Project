**KATHERINE FERNELIUS LARSEN - First Prize Poem: "The Cherry Orchard"**

She
Cherry Orchard

Katherine Fernelius Larsen

Out in the orchard, the sap is rising,
The cherry bark gleams mahogany-red.
The grass is showing new green by the tree roots,
And brown clods break from their thin snow bed.

I take my doll to the orchard swing,
And the sun-warmed air on my cheek breathes "Spring."
High and low, low and high,
Swing to earth, then swing to sky,
One with grass, then one with branches,
Doll and swing and I.

A world of enchantment, the orchard now;
The bridal branches, white as snow,
Lift lace-draped arms to the high, warm blue,
Drop idle petals to green below.
The orchard swoons while laden bees hover.
In the scent-sweet air, I await my lover.
Beat heart, beat; hum bees, hum;
Soon my love, my love, will come.
Stay the freighted moment, hold it
Close to the heart's wild drum!

The sun glows hot on crimson spheres,
Out the screen door my children spill.
"The cherries are ripe!" they shout, and pilfer
The plump and shining fruit, until
The red juice drips from greedy fingers,
And laughter spills from stained lips, and lingers...

Cherries ripe, cherries red,
Lush, inviting, overhead—
On rich fruit to satiation
Are my children fed.

Out in the orchard, silent and white,
The swing hangs empty, the limbs lift stark
Against a wintry sky, and rime
Of hoarfrost dulls the gleaming bark.
It is empty and still; yet branch and root
Hold memorized blossom, hold future fruit.

Katherine Fernelius Larsen, of Salt Lake City, is the wife of Rex F. Larsen and the mother of five young children. She is a member of the Art Barn Poets and Poets of the Pacific. Her poems have been published in The Improvement Era, TheWings, American Bard, The Salt Lake Tribune, and other publications. Last year she won second prize in the Annual Art Barn Poets Contest. A gifted student of literature, Mrs. Larsen plans to continue poetry composition and also to write fiction.

**ALICE MORREY BAILEY - Second Prize Poem: "Migrant"**

And No Defense

Look upon the universe.
The trees arise in passive might;
the daffodil, unwitting,
pours its gold from cup and frill;
the hollyhocks stand helpless
in the breeze and lean like whispering women,
while the bees traverse the petaled silk
and loot at will.

These live with sightless eyes and senses nil,
And no defense is theirs when north winds freeze.
Yet flowers know pulse and breath the same as I,
And spread their leaves with food beneath the sun;
Their seedlings grow mature and breed and die.
Some fold in hooded sleep when day is done.
What marks the difference, when both are sown
With life? Why, then, is conflict mine alone?

The Lives of These

Observe the cattle, hear the lonely loon;
The eagle soars where sky is thin and rare,
To plummet on his victim through the air;
The trout may swim his life in one lagoon.
The queen bee makes her nuptial flight at noon
And nevermore ascends its blazing stair.
The coyote finds his goal in prey and lair,
And sings his ghostly triumph to the moon.

The lives of these are bound and circumscribed
By laws unseen, immutable and fine.
Each threads a path of cycles pre-described,
While ultimate on ultimate is mine,
And I must ever yearn for heights too far,
Each star revealing yet another star.

Unbound

Have I not flown at will through star-hung space
In other worlds before this memory?
And tapped the source of light and energy,
And wrought my work unbound by time and place,
Untrapped by circumstance? Can I erase
Nostalgic pangs, when alien to me
Are clocks and cords and wheels?
Have I been free
To know unmeasured joy and perfect grace?

Why have the centuries behind my blood
Been restless in the labored ways of toil?
Why have they sought to rise from rocks and mud
To flight, or pioneered, or burned the precious oil
Of time for learning? Someday I shall go
Beyond the sea of death—and I shall know.

**RUBY BAIRD ANDERSEN - Third Prize Poem: "The Young War Widow Speaks"**

What good is a medal of oak leaves
On velvet in a case,
When the mind holds on to pictures
The heart cannot erase?

On the town's memorial plaque
When your only love has gone
And can never, oh, never come back?
On the back-yard bench the spring sun lies
Where he liked to sit making fishing flies.

No alchemy could work
In teeming word or sun,
If the heath is put a withered cone.

The plum hangs ripe on the green-leafed limb,
Just a little taller than the head of him.
Learn, I must, of many things,
And unlearn many more.
What is the shape of memory?
Is it twisted, pointed, and sharp?

Or large, star-shaped, and smooth like the dulcet tones of the harp?  
The sumac is red near the canyon's mouth,  
Three years since he went to camp in the South.  
Seasons can return again,  
New life that is spring's,  
Exultation that belongs to Maytime,  
And fruition that August brings;  
But blood and bone are passing,  
And muscle cannot last,  
Passion palpitates but once,  
Life's momentum soon is past.  
Memory often serves as bread,  
Or as a drink from which one sips,  
But memory cannot place a kiss  
Fresh upon the lips.  

The snowflakes slant around the corner light,  
There's a mound that's cold in a foreign night.  
Is it creeping centuries,  
Or only a thousand hours?  
That by this casement window I've climbed the night's blue towers  
To find this word, this answer:  
There's One who understands;  
I must lift my heart myself,  
With a pair of working hands.
