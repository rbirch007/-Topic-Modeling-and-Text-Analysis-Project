Pioneer Women
President David O. McKay
Of the First Presidency (Delivered at the afternoon session of the Annual Relief Society General Conference held in the Tabernacle, Thursday, October 2, 1947.)

SISTERS, Visiting Brethren,
the sweet perfume that radiates from these lovely leis, graciously presented by the President of the Oahu Stake in Hawaii, but typifies the sweet spirit of spirituality that radiates from this large audience of Relief Society workers.

When I think of the ideals you represent, as offered in the Relief Societies of the Church—self-improvement, perpetuation and beautification of home, preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ, service, not only to those in distress but to everyone who needs your tender care—I do not hesitate to say that this is one of the most significant gatherings, if not the most significant assembly of women in the world. I am glad to be with you. It is an inspiration to partake of your spirit.

We have listened to inspirational addresses from your fellow workers, representatives of the General Board, this inspirational singing from our Singing Mothers.
The ideals represented here cannot help but make everyone present feel that it is good to be here.

I know from the papers and from your program that you have had definite instruction regarding your work meeting and your literary lessons, your religious themes, social service, and all the other features of Relief Society work. Indeed, if I would I could not instruct you on these details, as I am not sufficiently informed.
I have, therefore, directed my attention along the lines suggested by Sister Spafford and her associates on the part that women have played in the Centennial, and my thoughts have not centered so much on what women have done throughout the counties (although their labors are inestimable and to them we owe the success, largely, of these great county celebrations that have been carried on during this Centennial Year), as upon the pioneer women who contributed so much and endured so much during those trying days of Nauvoo and during the trek to Salt Lake Valley.

In paying tribute to them we shall pay tribute to all womankind, especially to women in the Church, for they are just as loyal today as they were then.
As the Utah Centennial celebration draws to a close, it seems appropriate to pause a moment to pay tribute to these pioneer women. And well do they merit infinitely more than our feeble efforts can give them.
Their fitting praise requires the best that fluent tongues and gifted pens can express.

You will find few if any of their names inscribed on monuments erected to the brave. Some are not even known beyond their family circles; not a few lie in unmarked graves out on the plains, but the burdens they bore uncomplainingly,
PIONEER WOMEN
the contributions they made to the settlement of the arid West, the virtues they exemplified in the midst of trials and almost super-human endurance entitle them to an honored place among the heroines of the world.

We confess that during this Centennial we have not laid much emphasis upon the part that women played in the settlement of this Western Empire. In this we are but following the general practice of men throughout the ages.
Women bear the burdens of the household, carry most of the responsibility of rearing a family, inspire their husbands and sons to achieve success; and while the latter are being given the applause of public acclaim, the wives and mothers who really merit recognition and commendation remain smilingly content in unheralded achievement.

In the words of Jack Appleton:
"A man succeeds and reaps the honors of public applause when in truth a quiet little woman has made it all possible—has by her tact and encouragement held him to his best, has had faith in him when his own faith has languished, has cheered him with the unfailing assurance: 'You can, you must, you will.'"

Broken by Fate, unrelenting,
Scarred by the lashings of Chance;
Bitter his heart—unrepenting—
Hardened by Circumstance;
Shadowed by Failure ever,
Cursing, he would have died,
But the touch of her hand, her strong warm hand,
And her love of his soul, took full command,
Just at the turn of the tide!
Standing beside him, filled with trust,
"Win," she whispered, "you must, you must!"
Helping, and loving and guiding,
Urging when that were best,
Holding her fears in hiding,
Deep in her quiet breast;
This is the woman who kept him
True to his standards high,
Watching, and guarding, whispering still,
"Win, you can, you must, you will!"

This is the story of the ages,
This is Woman's way;
Wiser than seers or sages,
Lifting us day by day;
Facing all things with courage
Nothing can daunt or dim,
Treading Life's path, wherever it leads—
Lined with flowers or choked with weeds,
But ever with him—with him!

Guidon—comrade—golden spur—
The men who win are helped by her!

They admire beautiful things. They like to dress becomingly. 'They admire china and silverware. 'They enjoy decorating their rooms and making homes livable and attractive. They appreciate an occasional gift of jewelry, of a piece of Royal Doulton or of Dresden. The pioneer woman and her associates who entered Salt Lake Valley one hundred years ago enjoyed none of these luxuries. They had to be content, and were content with the mere necessities. With these inherent tendencies of womankind in mind, let me invite you, with the facts of history before us, to recross the plains with two or three of these heroines. 'Those to whom we refer this afternoon are but representatives of thousands to whom tribute is due. One of the most tragically heroic epochs in Church history, one in which are exemplified the dauntless faith and divine leadership of the men at the head of the Church, and the super-human, sublime patience, and resourcefulness of the women, is the period following the expulsion of the saints from Nauvoo, and the building of Winter Quarters on the banks of the Missouri. Most of our attention this year has been directed to the trek from Winter Quarters to Salt Lake Valley, but I think the greatest heroism of the Church, manifestations of the greatest leadership, and loyalty to Church and to ideals of the women, occurred between the months of February and September of 1846. The story of that trek has never yet been fully told. It is difficult for us who attempt to pay a feeble tribute to these pioneers one hundred years later, even to imagine, for example, what those shelterless mothers endured during the month of February 1846—note the month—as they passed through the throes of confinement on the banks of the Sugar Creek when nine babies were born. You mothers can understand this better than we men. The world will do well to pause and think what it was that inspired the women to endure uncomplainingly such trials. Picturing the scene, Eliza R. Snow writes: "We had been preceded from Nauvoo by thousands, and I was informed that on the first night of the encampment, nine children were born into the world, and from that time, as we journeyed onward, mothers gave birth to offspring under almost every variety of circumstances imaginable, except those to which they had been accustomed; some in tents, others in wagons—in rainstorms and in snowstorms. I heard of one birth which occurred under the rude shelter of a hut, the sides of which were formed of blankets fastened to poles stuck in the ground, with a bark roof through which the rain was dripping. Kind sisters stood holding dishes to catch the water as it fell, thus protecting the newcomer and its mother from a showerbath as the little innocent first entered on the stage of human life; and through faith in the Great Ruler of events, no harm resulted to either." In that month, women, driven from their comfortable homes in Nauvoo, left their land, which many of them could not sell, abandoned household furniture, treasured pictures and accumulated relics, left the old clock ticking a gloomy farewell, taking nothing with which they could do without, crossed the Mississippi River to begin a trackless journey, and to endure the hardships incident to camping in the open it on muddy ground, under inclement, often stormy skies, with inadequate provisions and clothing. Picture this afternoon, if you can—and this is a real incident—a young mother with the care and responsibility of three children—a girl of seven, a boy of five, and a baby boy one and one-half years old, subjected to these adverse conditions. On her and her little children, on February  PIONEER WOMEN 25, three inches of snow fell. Only tents and wagon boxes for shelter. The diaries of that day tell us that this mother and babies, as many others, had to sleep out of doors as the wagon boxes were loaded with food and with what few household necessities the refugees could take along. Time will not permit me to pause longer on that journey across Iowa. They reached Mount Pisgah in due time, stayed there until fall, then joined the saints at Winter Quarters and prepared to cross the plains next year. Now I am going to ask you to consider conditions ten years later. Thousands of women by that time had walked across the plains, your grandmothers and mine among them, and many of them prompted to do that out of consideration for widows who could not come any other way, so they shared the wagon and let the widow ride while they walked. "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me." But ten years later they had instituted, or inaugurated the handcart method of crossing the plains. Today, that just seems to me—I do not know—almost incomprehensible, but they fitted out their handcarts at Winter Quarters, loaded each with such household goods and such food as they could, took the cattle and drove them along, and marched across the plains singing that inspiring song with which you opened this gathering, "Come, Come, Ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear, but with joy wend your way." Wives pulling and pushing handcarts, aiding their husbands, while little children trudged at their sides! But in that year of 1856 two companies were delayed. They were advised not to attempt the trip. It was too late. One man who had crossed called them together and said: "You had better wait." But the majority voted to attempt it, and he said: "All right, if you are determined to go I will go with you and help you; if necessary, die with you." "Greater love, hath no man, than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." The next morning a young wife and mother stood by the side of a newly dug grave, the final resting place of her husband and fourteen others who had taken the last step on life's journey. One of those put in that grave had helped to dig it the night before. One of the mother's arms caressed a little boy sorrowfully sobbing as he buried his face in the folds of his mother's dress. You and I cannot even imagine the aching sorrow and poignant grief that must have filled that young woman's heart as she and her little son pulled their handcart that day without husband and daddy. Later, in the month of September, at the close of the day's march, a bride of twelve months gave birth to a baby girl. The records do not say whether the company halted for the mother to recuperate. If they did, it would be only for a day or two, and the young mother would have to trudge along carrying in her arms, or placing it on the handcart, her newborn babe. What a picture for an artist! What an appeal to the skeptical, indifferent world today! What an illustration of heroism and faith!

Illustrative of this last thought, I am going to tell you what that father said about it, years afterward, for the father, mother, and baby came to Utah, and it was my privilege to sit at the table of that little baby girl when she was grown, and hear the story from her own lips. She was living in a comfortable home with nine lovely children around her. In that same town, years later, a teacher, conducting a class, said it was unwise ever to attempt, even to permit them to come across the plains under such conditions. "Some sharp criticism of the Church and its leaders was being indulged in for permitting any company of converts to venture across the plains with no more supplies or protection than a handcart caravan afforded." An old man in the corner"�and this was written by President William Palmer, who was present"�"sat silent and listened as long as he could stand it, then he arose and said things that no person who heard him will ever forget. His face was white with emotion, yet he spoke calmly, deliberately, but with great earnestness and sincerity.

"In substance the father above mentioned said, 'I ask you to stop this criticism. You are discussing a matter you know nothing about. Cold historic facts mean nothing here, for they give no proper interpretation of the questions involved. Mistake to send the Handcart Company out so late in the season? Yes. But I was in that company and my wife was in it and Sister Nellie Unthank whom you have cited was there, too. We suffered beyond anything you can imagine," "and many died of exposure and starvation, but did you ever hear a survivor of that company utter a word of criticism? Not one of that company ever apostatized or left the Church, because everyone of us came through with the absolute knowledge that God lives for we became acquainted with him in our extremities."

"I have pulled my handcart when I was so weak and weary from illness and lack of food that I could hardly put one foot ahead of the other. I have looked ahead and seen a patch of sand or a hill slope and I have said, 'I can go only that far and there I must give up, for I cannot pull the load through it.' And a wife with a baby in her arms by his side! 'I have gone on to that sand and when I reached it, the cart began pushing me. I have looked back many times to see who was pushing my cart, but my eyes saw no one. I knew then that the angels of God were there.'

"Was I sorry that I chose to come by handcart? No. Neither then nor any minute of my life since. The price we paid to become acquainted with God was a privilege to pay, and I am thankful that I was privileged to come in the Martin Handcart Company."

TODAY, Sisters, we have hospitals, anesthetics, nurses, and every comfort and attention for mother and the newborn child. Yet many a woman of America today limits her family to one, two, or three children, sometimes justifying herself because of economic conditions. They cannot get houses in which to live; the husband is in school; but more often they are yielding to a desire to keep up social prestige, and to participate in entertainment and travel.

The pioneer women bore the responsibilities of large families even though they had to pass through the throes of confinement under the most adverse circumstances. This tendency to limit the number of children in a family, if considered only in the light of perpetuating the race, is most portentous. We are told by the president of the American Statistical Association that in order to maintain our population even at its present level, it would be necessary that each family which has any children should have an average of over three.

"In other words, so many people are unmarried or else have no children, though married, that this number of children is needed to balance the deaths, and thus maintain a stationary population without any growth from year to year." The increasing tendency to look upon family life as a burden, and the ever-spreading practice of birth control are ominous threats to the perpetuation of our nation.

In the light of what the restored gospel teaches us regarding pre-existence, the eternal nature of the marriage covenant, and of family relationship, no healthy wife in the Church should shun the responsibilities of normal motherhood. In our homes, as we have heard here today, all that is best and noblest should live. And this in most cases largely emanates from mother. Her "daily movements," as impressively expressed in Woman in the Home, "as she walks and sits and sings and serves, turn common life into a drama of grace, beauty, and power. And when mother's heart, full of mother's love, obeys the inspiration of good taste, the living room of the lowliest house becomes a stage on which are illustrated, under the spell of holy faith and morality, all that is best in human life.... Who dares to undervalue it?"

Today, on the stage of international politics a great contention is taking place between two ideologies�one, that we take the children and make them hostages or wards of the state; the other, that upholds the Christian home. God grant that his will may prevail in the present conflict.

To womanhood everywhere, and especially to those in the West who prize their heritage, may the memory of the sterling character and heroic deeds of our pioneer mothers be an inspiration to foster and practice in their daily lives, courage, modesty, virtue, loyalty, and faith�outstanding traits of the Utah pioneer women!

And will you pay your tribute to your mother, as I want to pay to mine, in the words that the prince paid to his: She of whom you speak, My mother, looks as pure as some serene creation minted in the golden moods Of sovereign artists; not a thought, a touch, But pure as lines of green that streaks the white Of the first snowdrop's inner leaves. (Tennyson)

God bless our mothers and our girls who hope to be mothers, that they may keep their bodies pure and unsullied, and merit from their sons the tribute we pay our mothers today, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.
