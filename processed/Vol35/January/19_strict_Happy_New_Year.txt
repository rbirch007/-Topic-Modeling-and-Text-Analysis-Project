Happy New Year!

HE General Board of Relief Society extends this wish, with all that it implies, to all Relief Society officers, members, and Magazine readers throughout the world.
We sincerely thank all of the officers, members, and friends of the Society the world over, for their loyalty and devotion to the great cause of Relief Society during the past year. We greatly appreciate the many courtesies shown the members of the General Board in their visits to the stakes.

Amid the rapid tempo of modern life with its growing complexities and anxieties, let us realize more than ever before that happiness, peace, and serenity come from within.
Let us make sure we are building our lives and our homes on a firm foundation of spirituality, and of faith in God and in the gospel of Jesus Christ.
May we face the New Year with its unknown problems with faith and courage, and may the Lord bless and sustain us in all of our righteous endeavors.

Affectionately yours,
Belle S. Spafford
