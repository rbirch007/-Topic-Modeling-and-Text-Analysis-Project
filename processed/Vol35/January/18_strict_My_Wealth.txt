SNOW UPON THE EARTH Christie Lund Coles

How white and still this snow upon the earth,
A benediction over hill and plain
Of winter-weary days.
The riotous birth
Of spring, with blossoms honey-sweet again,
Is not more beautiful than this; no scene
Of flowered summer nor autumnal fire
Surpasses these bejeweled webs that lean
Earthward in their white, virginal attire.

For here is peace and silver quietness
For the being moved too much by revelry
In April, and the wanton loveliness
Of Indian summer. It is good to be
Silent, growing strong in growing still,
Retrieving life and strength, as field and hill.
