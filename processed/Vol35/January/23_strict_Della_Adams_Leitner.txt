SNOW UPON THE EARTH Christie Lund Coles

How white and still this snow upon the earth,
A benediction over hill and plain
Of winter-weary days.
The riotous birth
Of spring, with blossoms honey-sweet again,
Is not more beautiful than this; no scene
Of flowered summer nor autumnal fire
Surpasses these bejeweled webs that lean
Earthward in their white, virginal attire.

For here is peace and silver quietness
For the being moved too much by revelry
In April, and the wanton loveliness
Of Indian summer. It is good to be
Silent, growing strong in growing still,
Retrieving life and strength, as field and hill.

Happy New Year!

HE General Board of Relief Society extends this wish, with all that it implies, to all Relief Society officers, members, and Magazine readers throughout the world.
We sincerely thank all of the officers, members, and friends of the Society the world over, for their loyalty and devotion to the great cause of Relief Society during the past year. We greatly appreciate the many courtesies shown the members of the General Board in their visits to the stakes.

Amid the rapid tempo of modern life with its growing complexities and anxieties, let us realize more than ever before that happiness, peace, and serenity come from within.
Let us make sure we are building our lives and our homes on a firm foundation of spirituality, and of faith in God and in the gospel of Jesus Christ.
May we face the New Year with its unknown problems with faith and courage, and may the Lord bless and sustain us in all of our righteous endeavors.

Affectionately yours,
Belle S. Spafford

General Presidency
Pioneer Women
President David O. McKay
Of the First Presidency (Delivered at the afternoon session of the Annual Relief Society General Conference held in the Tabernacle, Thursday, October 2, 1947.)

SISTERS, Visiting Brethren,
the sweet perfume that radiates from these lovely leis, graciously presented by the President of the Oahu Stake in Hawaii, but typifies the sweet spirit of spirituality that radiates from this large audience of Relief Society workers.

When I think of the ideals you represent, as offered in the Relief Societies of the Church—self-improvement, perpetuation and beautification of home, preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ, service, not only to those in distress but to everyone who needs your tender care—I do not hesitate to say that this is one of the most significant gatherings, if not the most significant assembly of women in the world. I am glad to be with you. It is an inspiration to partake of your spirit.

We have listened to inspirational addresses from your fellow workers, representatives of the General Board, this inspirational singing from our Singing Mothers.
The ideals represented here cannot help but make everyone present feel that it is good to be here.

I know from the papers and from your program that you have had definite instruction regarding your work meeting and your literary lessons, your religious themes, social service, and all the other features of Relief Society work. Indeed, if I would I could not instruct you on these details, as I am not sufficiently informed.
I have, therefore, directed my attention along the lines suggested by Sister Spafford and her associates on the part that women have played in the Centennial, and my thoughts have not centered so much on what women have done throughout the counties (although their labors are inestimable and to them we owe the success, largely, of these great county celebrations that have been carried on during this Centennial Year), as upon the pioneer women who contributed so much and endured so much during those trying days of Nauvoo and during the trek to Salt Lake Valley.

In paying tribute to them we shall pay tribute to all womankind, especially to women in the Church, for they are just as loyal today as they were then.
As the Utah Centennial celebration draws to a close, it seems appropriate to pause a moment to pay tribute to these pioneer women. And well do they merit infinitely more than our feeble efforts can give them.
Their fitting praise requires the best that fluent tongues and gifted pens can express.

You will find few if any of their names inscribed on monuments erected to the brave. Some are not even known beyond their family circles; not a few lie in unmarked graves out on the plains, but the burdens they bore uncomplainingly,
PIONEER WOMEN
the contributions they made to the settlement of the arid West, the virtues they exemplified in the midst of trials and almost super-human endurance entitle them to an honored place among the heroines of the world.

We confess that during this Centennial we have not laid much emphasis upon the part that women played in the settlement of this Western Empire. In this we are but following the general practice of men throughout the ages.
Women bear the burdens of the household, carry most of the responsibility of rearing a family, inspire their husbands and sons to achieve success; and while the latter are being given the applause of public acclaim, the wives and mothers who really merit recognition and commendation remain smilingly content in unheralded achievement.

In the words of Jack Appleton:
"A man succeeds and reaps the honors of public applause when in truth a quiet little woman has made it all possible—has by her tact and encouragement held him to his best, has had faith in him when his own faith has languished, has cheered him with the unfailing assurance: 'You can, you must, you will.'"

Broken by Fate, unrelenting,
Scarred by the lashings of Chance;
Bitter his heart—unrepenting—
Hardened by Circumstance;
Shadowed by Failure ever,
Cursing, he would have died,
But the touch of her hand, her strong warm hand,
And her love of his soul, took full command,
Just at the turn of the tide!
Standing beside him, filled with trust,
"Win," she whispered, "you must, you must!"
Helping, and loving and guiding,
Urging when that were best,
Holding her fears in hiding,
Deep in her quiet breast;
This is the woman who kept him
True to his standards high,
Watching, and guarding, whispering still,
"Win, you can, you must, you will!"

This is the story of the ages,
This is Woman's way;
Wiser than seers or sages,
Lifting us day by day;
Facing all things with courage
Nothing can daunt or dim,
Treading Life's path, wherever it leads—
Lined with flowers or choked with weeds,
But ever with him—with him!

Guidon—comrade—golden spur—
The men who win are helped by her!

They admire beautiful things. They like to dress becomingly. 'They admire china and silverware. 'They enjoy decorating their rooms and making homes livable and attractive. They appreciate an occasional gift of jewelry, of a piece of Royal Doulton or of Dresden. The pioneer woman and her associates who entered Salt Lake Valley one hundred years ago enjoyed none of these luxuries. They had to be content, and were content with the mere necessities. With these inherent tendencies of womankind in mind, let me invite you, with the facts of history before us, to recross the plains with two or three of these heroines. 'Those to whom we refer this afternoon are but representatives of thousands to whom tribute is due. One of the most tragically heroic epochs in Church history, one in which are exemplified the dauntless faith and divine leadership of the men at the head of the Church, and the super-human, sublime patience, and resourcefulness of the women, is the period following the expulsion of the saints from Nauvoo, and the building of Winter Quarters on the banks of the Missouri. Most of our attention this year has been directed to the trek from Winter Quarters to Salt Lake Valley, but I think the greatest heroism of the Church, manifestations of the greatest leadership, and loyalty to Church and to ideals of the women, occurred between the months of February and September of 1846. The story of that trek has never yet been fully told. It is difficult for us who attempt to pay a feeble tribute to these pioneers one hundred years later, even to imagine, for example, what those shelterless mothers endured during the month of February 1846—note the month—as they passed through the throes of confinement on the banks of the Sugar Creek when nine babies were born. You mothers can understand this better than we men. The world will do well to pause and think what it was that inspired the women to endure uncomplainingly such trials. Picturing the scene, Eliza R. Snow writes: "We had been preceded from Nauvoo by thousands, and I was informed that on the first night of the encampment, nine children were born into the world, and from that time, as we journeyed onward, mothers gave birth to offspring under almost every variety of circumstances imaginable, except those to which they had been accustomed; some in tents, others in wagons—in rainstorms and in snowstorms. I heard of one birth which occurred under the rude shelter of a hut, the sides of which were formed of blankets fastened to poles stuck in the ground, with a bark roof through which the rain was dripping. Kind sisters stood holding dishes to catch the water as it fell, thus protecting the newcomer and its mother from a showerbath as the little innocent first entered on the stage of human life; and through faith in the Great Ruler of events, no harm resulted to either." In that month, women, driven from their comfortable homes in Nauvoo, left their land, which many of them could not sell, abandoned household furniture, treasured pictures and accumulated relics, left the old clock ticking a gloomy farewell, taking nothing with which they could do without, crossed the Mississippi River to begin a trackless journey, and to endure the hardships incident to camping in the open it on muddy ground, under inclement, often stormy skies, with inadequate provisions and clothing. Picture this afternoon, if you can—and this is a real incident—a young mother with the care and responsibility of three children—a girl of seven, a boy of five, and a baby boy one and one-half years old, subjected to these adverse conditions. On her and her little children, on February  PIONEER WOMEN 25, three inches of snow fell. Only tents and wagon boxes for shelter. The diaries of that day tell us that this mother and babies, as many others, had to sleep out of doors as the wagon boxes were loaded with food and with what few household necessities the refugees could take along. Time will not permit me to pause longer on that journey across Iowa. They reached Mount Pisgah in due time, stayed there until fall, then joined the saints at Winter Quarters and prepared to cross the plains next year. Now I am going to ask you to consider conditions ten years later. Thousands of women by that time had walked across the plains, your grandmothers and mine among them, and many of them prompted to do that out of consideration for widows who could not come any other way, so they shared the wagon and let the widow ride while they walked. "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me." But ten years later they had instituted, or inaugurated the handcart method of crossing the plains. Today, that just seems to me—I do not know—almost incomprehensible, but they fitted out their handcarts at Winter Quarters, loaded each with such household goods and such food as they could, took the cattle and drove them along, and marched across the plains singing that inspiring song with which you opened this gathering, "Come, Come, Ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear, but with joy wend your way." Wives pulling and pushing handcarts, aiding their husbands, while little children trudged at their sides! But in that year of 1856 two companies were delayed. They were advised not to attempt the trip. It was too late. One man who had crossed called them together and said: "You had better wait." But the majority voted to attempt it, and he said: "All right, if you are determined to go I will go with you and help you; if necessary, die with you." "Greater love, hath no man, than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." The next morning a young wife and mother stood by the side of a newly dug grave, the final resting place of her husband and fourteen others who had taken the last step on life's journey. One of those put in that grave had helped to dig it the night before. One of the mother's arms caressed a little boy sorrowfully sobbing as he buried his face in the folds of his mother's dress. You and I cannot even imagine the aching sorrow and poignant grief that must have filled that young woman's heart as she and her little son pulled their handcart that day without husband and daddy. Later, in the month of September, at the close of the day's march, a bride of twelve months gave birth to a baby girl. The records do not say whether the company halted for the mother to recuperate. If they did, it would be only for a day or two, and the young mother would have to trudge along carrying in her arms, or placing it on the handcart, her newborn babe. What a picture for an artist! What an appeal to the skeptical, indifferent world today! What an illustration of heroism and faith!

Illustrative of this last thought, I am going to tell you what that father said about it, years afterward, for the father, mother, and baby came to Utah, and it was my privilege to sit at the table of that little baby girl when she was grown, and hear the story from her own lips. She was living in a comfortable home with nine lovely children around her. In that same town, years later, a teacher, conducting a class, said it was unwise ever to attempt, even to permit them to come across the plains under such conditions. "Some sharp criticism of the Church and its leaders was being indulged in for permitting any company of converts to venture across the plains with no more supplies or protection than a handcart caravan afforded." An old man in the corner"�and this was written by President William Palmer, who was present"�"sat silent and listened as long as he could stand it, then he arose and said things that no person who heard him will ever forget. His face was white with emotion, yet he spoke calmly, deliberately, but with great earnestness and sincerity.

"In substance the father above mentioned said, 'I ask you to stop this criticism. You are discussing a matter you know nothing about. Cold historic facts mean nothing here, for they give no proper interpretation of the questions involved. Mistake to send the Handcart Company out so late in the season? Yes. But I was in that company and my wife was in it and Sister Nellie Unthank whom you have cited was there, too. We suffered beyond anything you can imagine," "and many died of exposure and starvation, but did you ever hear a survivor of that company utter a word of criticism? Not one of that company ever apostatized or left the Church, because everyone of us came through with the absolute knowledge that God lives for we became acquainted with him in our extremities."

"I have pulled my handcart when I was so weak and weary from illness and lack of food that I could hardly put one foot ahead of the other. I have looked ahead and seen a patch of sand or a hill slope and I have said, 'I can go only that far and there I must give up, for I cannot pull the load through it.' And a wife with a baby in her arms by his side! 'I have gone on to that sand and when I reached it, the cart began pushing me. I have looked back many times to see who was pushing my cart, but my eyes saw no one. I knew then that the angels of God were there.'

"Was I sorry that I chose to come by handcart? No. Neither then nor any minute of my life since. The price we paid to become acquainted with God was a privilege to pay, and I am thankful that I was privileged to come in the Martin Handcart Company."

TODAY, Sisters, we have hospitals, anesthetics, nurses, and every comfort and attention for mother and the newborn child. Yet many a woman of America today limits her family to one, two, or three children, sometimes justifying herself because of economic conditions. They cannot get houses in which to live; the husband is in school; but more often they are yielding to a desire to keep up social prestige, and to participate in entertainment and travel.

The pioneer women bore the responsibilities of large families even though they had to pass through the throes of confinement under the most adverse circumstances. This tendency to limit the number of children in a family, if considered only in the light of perpetuating the race, is most portentous. We are told by the president of the American Statistical Association that in order to maintain our population even at its present level, it would be necessary that each family which has any children should have an average of over three.

"In other words, so many people are unmarried or else have no children, though married, that this number of children is needed to balance the deaths, and thus maintain a stationary population without any growth from year to year." The increasing tendency to look upon family life as a burden, and the ever-spreading practice of birth control are ominous threats to the perpetuation of our nation.

In the light of what the restored gospel teaches us regarding pre-existence, the eternal nature of the marriage covenant, and of family relationship, no healthy wife in the Church should shun the responsibilities of normal motherhood. In our homes, as we have heard here today, all that is best and noblest should live. And this in most cases largely emanates from mother. Her "daily movements," as impressively expressed in Woman in the Home, "as she walks and sits and sings and serves, turn common life into a drama of grace, beauty, and power. And when mother's heart, full of mother's love, obeys the inspiration of good taste, the living room of the lowliest house becomes a stage on which are illustrated, under the spell of holy faith and morality, all that is best in human life.... Who dares to undervalue it?"

Today, on the stage of international politics a great contention is taking place between two ideologies�one, that we take the children and make them hostages or wards of the state; the other, that upholds the Christian home. God grant that his will may prevail in the present conflict.

To womanhood everywhere, and especially to those in the West who prize their heritage, may the memory of the sterling character and heroic deeds of our pioneer mothers be an inspiration to foster and practice in their daily lives, courage, modesty, virtue, loyalty, and faith�outstanding traits of the Utah pioneer women!

And will you pay your tribute to your mother, as I want to pay to mine, in the words that the prince paid to his: She of whom you speak, My mother, looks as pure as some serene creation minted in the golden moods Of sovereign artists; not a thought, a touch, But pure as lines of green that streaks the white Of the first snowdrop's inner leaves. (Tennyson)

God bless our mothers and our girls who hope to be mothers, that they may keep their bodies pure and unsullied, and merit from their sons the tribute we pay our mothers today, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

**KATHERINE FERNELIUS LARSEN - First Prize Poem: "The Cherry Orchard"**

She
Cherry Orchard

Katherine Fernelius Larsen

Out in the orchard, the sap is rising,
The cherry bark gleams mahogany-red.
The grass is showing new green by the tree roots,
And brown clods break from their thin snow bed.

I take my doll to the orchard swing,
And the sun-warmed air on my cheek breathes "Spring."
High and low, low and high,
Swing to earth, then swing to sky,
One with grass, then one with branches,
Doll and swing and I.

A world of enchantment, the orchard now;
The bridal branches, white as snow,
Lift lace-draped arms to the high, warm blue,
Drop idle petals to green below.
The orchard swoons while laden bees hover.
In the scent-sweet air, I await my lover.
Beat heart, beat; hum bees, hum;
Soon my love, my love, will come.
Stay the freighted moment, hold it
Close to the heart's wild drum!

The sun glows hot on crimson spheres,
Out the screen door my children spill.
"The cherries are ripe!" they shout, and pilfer
The plump and shining fruit, until
The red juice drips from greedy fingers,
And laughter spills from stained lips, and lingers...

Cherries ripe, cherries red,
Lush, inviting, overhead—
On rich fruit to satiation
Are my children fed.

Out in the orchard, silent and white,
The swing hangs empty, the limbs lift stark
Against a wintry sky, and rime
Of hoarfrost dulls the gleaming bark.
It is empty and still; yet branch and root
Hold memorized blossom, hold future fruit.

Katherine Fernelius Larsen, of Salt Lake City, is the wife of Rex F. Larsen and the mother of five young children. She is a member of the Art Barn Poets and Poets of the Pacific. Her poems have been published in The Improvement Era, TheWings, American Bard, The Salt Lake Tribune, and other publications. Last year she won second prize in the Annual Art Barn Poets Contest. A gifted student of literature, Mrs. Larsen plans to continue poetry composition and also to write fiction.

**ALICE MORREY BAILEY - Second Prize Poem: "Migrant"**

And No Defense

Look upon the universe.
The trees arise in passive might;
the daffodil, unwitting,
pours its gold from cup and frill;
the hollyhocks stand helpless
in the breeze and lean like whispering women,
while the bees traverse the petaled silk
and loot at will.

These live with sightless eyes and senses nil,
And no defense is theirs when north winds freeze.
Yet flowers know pulse and breath the same as I,
And spread their leaves with food beneath the sun;
Their seedlings grow mature and breed and die.
Some fold in hooded sleep when day is done.
What marks the difference, when both are sown
With life? Why, then, is conflict mine alone?

The Lives of These

Observe the cattle, hear the lonely loon;
The eagle soars where sky is thin and rare,
To plummet on his victim through the air;
The trout may swim his life in one lagoon.
The queen bee makes her nuptial flight at noon
And nevermore ascends its blazing stair.
The coyote finds his goal in prey and lair,
And sings his ghostly triumph to the moon.

The lives of these are bound and circumscribed
By laws unseen, immutable and fine.
Each threads a path of cycles pre-described,
While ultimate on ultimate is mine,
And I must ever yearn for heights too far,
Each star revealing yet another star.

Unbound

Have I not flown at will through star-hung space
In other worlds before this memory?
And tapped the source of light and energy,
And wrought my work unbound by time and place,
Untrapped by circumstance? Can I erase
Nostalgic pangs, when alien to me
Are clocks and cords and wheels?
Have I been free
To know unmeasured joy and perfect grace?

Why have the centuries behind my blood
Been restless in the labored ways of toil?
Why have they sought to rise from rocks and mud
To flight, or pioneered, or burned the precious oil
Of time for learning? Someday I shall go
Beyond the sea of death—and I shall know.

(For biographical sketch of Alice Morrey Bailey, see page 23.)

**RUBY BAIRD ANDERSEN - Third Prize Poem: "The Young War Widow Speaks"**

What good is a medal of oak leaves
On velvet in a case,
When the mind holds on to pictures
The heart cannot erase?

On the town's memorial plaque
When your only love has gone
And can never, oh, never come back?
On the back-yard bench the spring sun lies
Where he liked to sit making fishing flies.

No alchemy could work
In teeming word or sun,
If the heath is put a withered cone.

The plum hangs ripe on the green-leafed limb,
Just a little taller than the head of him.
Learn, I must, of many things,
And unlearn many more.
What is the shape of memory?
Is it twisted, pointed, and sharp?

Or large, star-shaped, and smooth like the dulcet tones of the harp?  
The sumac is red near the canyon's mouth,  
Three years since he went to camp in the South.  
Seasons can return again,  
New life that is spring's,  
Exultation that belongs to Maytime,  
And fruition that August brings;  
But blood and bone are passing,  
And muscle cannot last,  
Passion palpitates but once,  
Life's momentum soon is past.  
Memory often serves as bread,  
Or as a drink from which one sips,  
But memory cannot place a kiss  
Fresh upon the lips.  

The snowflakes slant around the corner light,  
There's a mound that's cold in a foreign night.  
Is it creeping centuries,  
Or only a thousand hours?  
That by this casement window I've climbed the night's blue towers  
To find this word, this answer:  
There's One who understands;  
I must lift my heart myself,  
With a pair of working hands.  

Ruby Baird Andersen, wife of Reuben Andersen of Provo, Utah, has two teen-age daughters and is a competent and charming homemaker. An active worker in the auxiliaries of the Church, she has served as a ward Relief Society president. As a member of the Provo Chapter of the League of Utah writers, Mrs. Andersen has been studying and writing poetry for several years. Her work has appeared in The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon), the Provo Daily Herald, Theand other publications. Two of her poems were included in the anthology, Utah Sings, and one poem was published in Our Legacy, the Relief Society Centennial Anthology of Verse. On December 7, 1947, Ruby Baird Andersen passed away after a two weeks' illness. She had seen her picture and her poem in page proof the day before her death.  

THE Relief Society General Board is pleased to announce the names of the award winners in the short story contest which was announced in the June 1947 issue of the Magazine, and which closed September 15, 1947.

The first prize story of forty dollars is awarded to Alice Morey Bailey, 256 Iowa Street, Salt Lake City, Utah, for her story "Nugget of Truth."

The second prize of thirty dollars is awarded to Janath Russell Cameron, 237 "D" Street, Salt Lake City, Utah, for her story "The Answer."

The third prize of twenty dollars is awarded to Myrtle M. Dean, 435 East 2d South, Provo, Utah, for her story "Our Children's Children."

This story contest, first conducted by the Relief Society General Board in 1941 as a feature of the Relief Society centennial observance, was made an annual contest in 1943. The contest is open only to Latter-day Saint women who have not at least one literary composition published or accepted for publication by a periodical of recognized standing.

The three prize-winning stories are to be published consecutively in the first three issues of the Magazine for 1948.

Thirty-three manuscripts were submitted in the contest for 1947. Only one of the prize winners for this year had previously placed in the Annual Relief Society Short Story Contest.

This contest was initiated to encourage Latter-day Saint women to express themselves in the field of fiction. The General Board feels that the response to this opportunity will continue to increase the literary quality of Theand will aid the women of the Church in the development of their gifts in creative writing.

Many of the stories submitted in the 1947 contest emphasized the moral theme to the detriment of the quality of the stories. It is suggested that the authors try to improve the literary craftsmanship of their submissions, giving the story plan and particular attention to character development, and giving careful attention to the fine details of word and sentence structure.

Thenow has a circulation of more than 85,000. There are subscribers in every state of the Union, and in many foreign countries, thus providing a varied and interested group of readers. Writers, recognizing this large and appreciative audience, realize the importance of centering the contest on their very best work.

The General Board congratulates the prize-winning contestants, and expresses appreciation to all those who submitted stories. Sincere gratitude is extended to the three who, in their discernment and skill in selecting the prize-winning stories.

The General Board also acknowledges the valuable contribution of the short story committee in supervising the contest.

First Prize Story
"Nugget of Truth"
Alice Mortey Bailey

Her heels and looked at her small daughter, Penny, in dismay. It wasn't enough to have all this packing to do before the train would leave at six in the morning. On top of it, she must have this nagging worry about Penny.

"Just what did you tell the man at the door, Penny?" "I told him a great big elephant jumped out of the closet and ate you all up," said Penny, with a beatific smile. "Now can we pack my dolly dresses?"

"Penny, you didn't!" "Yes, I did, and I told him, besides, you haven't a minute to spare, and you look a sight!"

"Oh," moaned Anna Lea. "Whatever is Mommy going to do with you? And what is your Daddy going to think when we get to San Francisco, and he finds out you still tell fibs? You're a big girl now, more than four."

Bill wouldn't understand it, any more than she did, but there it was. Modern parents, Bill said, didn't let things like this go on. Wasn't there child psychology, or some way to get at the bottom of it and find out why Penny lied? Bill called it that. Lies.

And it was no use for Anna Lea to talk of an over-active imagination, because Bill had been brought up in a strict household. He thought he was being liberal not to take his razor stop to Penny, or to lock her in the closet. He was going to, he said, if Penny wasn't cured by the time they got to San Francisco.

"It's up to you, Dear. You're the one who is with her all the time. I can't do a thing when I'm traveling like this," he had said. Bill was very young looking, but his jaw was firm, and if the truth had it, that was the real reason why

NUGGET OF TRUTH

he had given up the job of troubleshooter on the Santa Fe and had taken a job in the office—so he could spank Penny and lock her in the closet.

Anna Lea didn't know very much about children, but even she knew there should be a better way. Bill didn't know how big and heavy his hand was, and when Bill got angry he shouted.

"Who was the man at the door, Darling? Did he say?"

"Oh yes! That was Mr. Jefferson, and he is one of Daddy's friends." The name didn't ring any bell in Anna Lea's memory. Bill was sweet. He had so many friends. He was big and ambitious and forthright.

It wasn't so much that she was afraid of Bill as it was that she was afraid he would stop loving her. "A man's choice of a wife can't be overestimated," he said once. He was reading about a friend's divorce in the paper. "You take Stubby, here. It says incompatibility in the paper, but it goes a lot deeper than that. Stubby was with me over there, and he thought he had the world wrapped up in a little blond cocoon, but what does he find when he gets home? The cocoon turns out to be a butterfly." "Bill, that's clever!" "These war marriages! A guy gets all steamed up and heroic, and everything looks like hot stuff to him. He grabs off a last-minute marriage before he goes out to fight, and when he gets home he finds he's tied for life to some little ball of fluff, if not to a grindstone." "Millstone, Bill," corrected Anna Lea, and added in a very small voice, "ours was a war marriage." "Right," said Bill, "and did I know you? You had me so dazzled I didn't know what went on in that little head of yours." He had stood up then, to come and kiss her. "And you still do," he said, his eyes growing warm, his lips circling her face with kisses. "But I mean to find out." And when he did, what would he know? Would he still love her? Would he think she had character? He had thought so the day he had given her her watch—the day Penny was born. "Honey," he had said, sitting beside the hospital bed after it was all over and she had rested, "I brought you something." He had been down to send the good news telegrams. "It's a good watch, the best there is. Just like your little heart, ticking away all the time you were bringing my baby. I'm so glad it didn't stop," he said, and his face crumpled, his voice too. There were tears on her hands when he snapped the watch on her wrist.

"K E K K & 'XX"

WHEN are we going to pack my dolly dresses?" Penny's voice jolted her back into reality. Doll clothes were spread all over the overstuffed chair, enough of them to fill the space needed for Anna Lea's fur coat. "Those old rags! Throw them away, Penny Dearest, and we'll get you some more when we get there." "I couldn't," said Penny. "This dress I bought at Moffats, and it costed millions of dollars. It's real velvet. And this one is silk, and it costed millions of dollars, too. Besides I made them all myself, and my dolls can talk to me when you are gone, and they told me while you were asleep that they just love their clothes." "Oh, Penny," said Anna Lea in despair. "Can't you tell the truth?" "This time I am," said Penny virtuously. "They are really silk and velvet, and I really did pay millions...." "Penny!" Penny's eyes filled with tears and she began to cry, her little lower lip trembling. Penny was still a baby, with a baby's contours curving into creases at her wrists and elbows, and at the base of her sweet little throat, where Bill said that kisses grew. "How about a kiss for Daddy?" he would say, and Penny would tip back her head. "Are there any kisses there?" "Dozens of them," Bill would declare. "Then you can have them," Penny would tell him, stopping her play dutifully, tangling his hair and laughing when he tickled her. Penny's dimpled features could go, as Bill said, from May flowers to April showers in a matter of split seconds, and just now they were all woe. Anna Lea couldn't hold out against the grief in the small face, and took Penny in her arms. "There, Baby!" she said, patting her. "Will you pack my dolly dresses?" Penny said, mollified and pressing quick advantage. "Yes, yes, Dear. Mother will," promised Anna Lea, a little taken aback, and with mental reservations. I just can't! She thought. So much to pack—so little space. I'll have to think of something. "Put them in your box and leave them. I'll have to see where they'll fit. Why don't you help Mother to remember all the things," she added, hoping to get Penny's mind off the doll clothes. It gave Anna Lea a headache to think of all the little, last minute details—services to be discontinued, a drayman for her trunks, and the countless friends who called, wanting to take her to lunch, to dinner, to a show on her last day here. She had run the gamut of excuses. "I'd love to, Darling, but I have a terrific headache," or an appointment with the dentist, anything that came quickly to mind. "We must remember our tooth brushes in the morning. We have to leave them out to use. Help me to remember to give the apartment key back to the manager, and to think of a good safe place to pack my jewelry...." He had put her jewelry in every piece of luggage she had, her watch, her costume jewelry, and the emerald pin and earrings Bill had given her, only to take them out again. She picked up her watch, laying its smooth crystal to her cheek, thinking of Bill. It was a warm link between them. "Mommy, let me wear your watch on the train," Penny asked. "Of course not, Honey. I can't even wear it myself, because the link is broken." Her watch fascinated Penny. She would miss it acutely. She sighed and put it back with the little heap of jewelry on the desk. There were little heaps everywhere, her stockings and underwear, Bill's dress clothes, and Penny's dolls. It was  NUGGET OF TRUTH too much, and now there was that man, Bill's friend to worry about. She should have answered the door, herself, but it would have been too awful to have him see her like this, in slacks and mules, her hair in a kerchief and her face smudged with dust. And all this litter! Penny's doll clothes added the finishing touch. Penny was industriously packing them into her box, her face a miniature of housewifely concern. If Bill could only see her now! She was so adorable, her baby lips pursed, her round little fingers making their vague movements. Who could spank a child like that? "Penny, would you like to play at Jamie's for half an hour?" Anna Lea asked after a little busy silence.

WHEN Penny had gone Anna Lea let herself out of the service entrance and into the elevator to the basement. She had a basket of things to be burned. Uppermost on it was the box of Penny's doll clothes, atrocious little things Penny had crudely fashioned from her own worn-out things, silk print and old velvet, badly cut, with raw edges and ridiculous stitching. She would really have to teach Penny to sew, now that she was old enough.

It was all trash, bits of crumpled lace, some artificial flowers matted with embroidery silk, and some stringy ribbons. Nevertheless, she had a guilty little pang as she put them into the fire, turning her face from the heat of the glowing coals. She watched the sides of the box darken with smoke and the edges begin to curl. There was an instant when she would have snatched them out, but they broke into flame, and it was too late. Millions of dollars, Penny had said. With a little constriction of her heart, Anna Lea shut the door on the burning doll clothes and went upstairs. She shut her eyes, but couldn't shut out the sight of the flame, browning the tiny sun-suit, licking the small blue coat. The telephone was ringing as she went back into the apartment, Western Union, calling with a telegram from Bill. Jefferson, the big boss, calling to see you en route East. Squelch Penny's imagination. Everything depends on good impression. Better job, more money. Jefferson stickler for truth. Poor Bill! He must have been fearful to have sent that. "Oh!" she said suddenly, "Mr. Jefferson!" The truth hit her like a landslide. That was Mr. Jefferson whom Penny had told an elephant had eaten her mother—the man at the door. This was too awful! Bill would never forgive her. What was worse, he would never forgive Penny. A stickler for truth, Bill had said. Anna Lea wished fervently she might dissolve in thin air. What should she do? Rectify the mistake, obviously, but how? Where did he stay? If she could call him and tell the absolute truth, invite him to dinner at her new home as soon as he returned to San Francisco, that might do it. Somehow she would fix things for Bill.

SHE began calling the hotels. "Is a Mr. Jefferson registered there?" she asked repeatedly. After half an hour at the telephone, searching his whereabouts, she gave up. Anger overwhelmed her. Anger at Bill. What did he think, that you could tear your goods out of your home—well, your apartment—and be serenely calm enough to receive visitors? Anger at Penny. Bill was not so far wrong with his razor strops and closets—even closets inhabited with the terrifying "elephants!" of Penny's imagination. Why couldn't the child have said what she was told to say, that her mother had a headache, that she was ill? Even that now seemed a flimsy excuse. Anna Lea had supposed it to be some kind of joke. It could be Simmons from across the hall.

She was angry even at the unsuspecting Mr. Jefferson. Why, at least, couldn't he have telephoned? She was sitting beside her open trunk, her fingers pressing her throbbing temples, trying to think what next to do, when Penny burst in.

"I told Jamie I couldn't play any more because I have the measles and a broken leg, and besides I have to pack up baby's clothes."

Penny stopped short, looking for the box. "Did you pack them, Mommy? Did you put them in a suitcase?" she asked apprehensively.

Anna Lea, conscious of the guilt of being busy, did not answer. Penny came and stood before her in small implacability.

"Did you put my doll clothes in a suitcase, Mommy?"

"Yes, yes," mumbled Anna Lea in a preoccupied manner, lifting her stocking box into the tilt of her trunk with great care.

"Which suitcase did you put them in?" Penny insisted.

Anna Lea waved a vague hand at the set of bags and boxes.

"Oh Lord!" Penny. One of those. I can't remember. We'll find out when we get to San Francisco," she evaded.

I'll get her some real velvet and satin and make her dolls beautiful clothes the minute we get there, she promised herself. Penny subsided in a chair, not satisfied, but thoughtful. Anna Lea hoped, with a little sigh of relief, that the uncomfortable matter was closed.

"It was a really good place to pack your jewelry," Penny commenced in adult-like conversationalism.

"My jewelry!" said Anna Lea, startled. "What do you mean?" The heap of jewelry was gone from the desk. "Penny, where is Mother's jewelry?"

"You said to help you find a good place, and I helped. I put it down in the middle of my baby clothes box. Wasn't I a good girl?"

"You mean it's bumped? My jewelry—my watch that Daddy gave me—burned in the trunk?" 

ANNA Lea stood stock-still, remembering the flame that licked at the side of the box, remembering the glowing bed of coals beneath, the finger pointing at her. She stared at her, her eyes round and accusing.

"You burned up my dolly dresses, Mommy," she stated. "You said you packed them."

Anna Lea had a sick feeling, seeing the child's stricken face, sensing her own loss. Penny had loved those doll clothes as much as she had loved her watch.

She opened her mouth, the urge for excuses, palliatives, promises, strong upon her, but the moment was too deep, too significant. On it turned her whole life, her entire shop with Penny—with Bill. "I told you a lie, Penny," she said, wrenching the words from their habitual sockets. "A big, very bad lie. I did say I packed them. I did burn your baby clothes."

Penny's sobs were heartbreak. "Lana's velvet dress—Billy Boy's blue coat—burned!"

No less burning was the vision of Bill's job, swept into the holocaust of Mr. Jefferson's disapproval, Bill's love for her, smoking in contempt, licked by the small flames of her own worth lies and deceits of convenience. She knelt beside Penny.

"I know how you feel, Penny. I've been a very bad mother. I know exactly how you feel!"

Penny stopped short, struck by an idea. "My own pack them, Mommy? Daddy's pack—"

"Don't cry, my pretty Mama," she wept on. "My dolly's clothes didn't cost millions and millions of dollars,
and I didn't buy them at Moffats. My dollies didn't tell me they loved them, because my dollies can't talk."

"Penny, you're telling the truth," marveled Anna Lea.

Penny's eyes smiled tears and her little mouth trembled.

"Of course! I thought it was a lovely good place to pack your jewelry," she said contritely.

"Oh, Baby!" And Anna Lea took Penny into her arms. The reason why Penny lied—the cure for it—lay like a nugget in the ashes of her loss.

The telephone rang, then, like a second chance. It was Mr. Jefferson.

"Just a moment," Anna Lea said cupping the mouthpiece. "It was a good place, Penny Darling. A very good place!"

FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ZION AND THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ALL NATIONS.� APOSTROPHE (To the liberated spirit of Zion's late Prophetess and Poetess Eliza R. Snow Smith)
Holiness, akin to beauty,
Stamped thee with a marvelous seal;
Powerful was thy sense of duty,
Irrepressible thy zeal;
Counselor, so true, so able;
Ready to relieve distress;
The afflicted and the tempted
'Twas thy ministry to bless.
Emily H., Emily Woodmansee

LETTER FROM OHIO:
I was told the other day by an acquaintance that my "Mormon friend, Eliza Snow, is dead," and he said that notices of her death were in all the Cincinnati papers. I did not see the notices, but I felt very much saddened to hear of it. One's life is made up of regrets, at least my life is. I shall always regret that I never had a fuller acquaintance with "Sister Eliza" as you all so lovingly call her. She was a noble, a wonderful woman, it seemed to me, and I shall now always think of her as being in heaven with the many who were "first at the sepulcher," and as always busy and happy.
I wonder what the future of the peculiar people will be. . . .
There is work in church and moral movements for women now. God grant that we may all do our work faithfully.
Emily Scott

THE OLD YEAR'S BLESSINGS
I am fading from you,
But one draweth near,
Called the angel guardian
Of the coming year;
I brought joy to brighten
Many happy days;
Let the New Year's angel
Turn them into praise.
Adelaide A. Proctor

EDITORIAL NOTE: Jack, the Fisherman, by Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, is a pathetic story of the net woven by the demon alcohol to entrap the unwary. The tale is told with a depth of pity and tenderness that should waken a responsive chord in the heart of every person to work for the rescue of precious souls from the horrors of intemperance.

FROM SAN JUAN STAKE:
The quarterly conference of the Relief Society was held at Bluff, December 4, 1887, with President Jane M. Walton presiding. She reported that there was a good feeling among the sisters. . . . said they had money to buy grain, and hoped that sometime they would have a place to put it in.
Sister Martha Hammond said the sisters of the Mancos Ward were storing up grain and felt that the brethren were sustaining them.
Sister H. Barton said she wished to teach her children correct principles,

Hundred years ago last November 7, Elizabeth Blackwell entered the only medical school that would accept a woman, to become, two years later, America's first woman doctor.

Contending against social ostracism and unfair professional treatment, she yet built a great career and accomplished untold good, relying on God for guidance. 'To honor her, the American Medical Women's Association is planning to build a library on the campus of the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania. On the bookplate to be used in the library is, center, a vignette of Arete, the "Light of Hellas" (ancient Greece), author of forty books on natural science and healing. Around the border of the bookplate are names of women famous in medicine, among them: Blackwell; Stevenson, _ first woman member and delegate to the American Medical Association, 1876; La Chapelle, famous French midwife; Erxleben, who practiced in Germany about 1750; Kahn, pioneer Chinese woman physician; Joshi, first medical woman in India; Mazzolini, early Italian medical woman inventor.

ONE of the largest funerals ever held in Franklin, Idaho, was that of Mrs. Eliza Doney Lowe, a sweet lady of eighty-four, who was active in Relief Society for more than fifty years and put its precepts into practice daily. Most of her waking hours, these later years, she spent helping those who needed comfort or assistance, whether they were rich or poor. She is survived by ninety-five great-grandchildren.

ANOTHER beloved Relief Society worker who died recently: in Salt Lake City, at the age 'of: ninety-eight, was Mrs. Juliana Petrea Thygesen Fredericksen, a native of Denmark.

EURIDICE TURANO, a lovely girl from Buenos Aires, Argentina, now enrolled at the Brigham Young University, Provo, is fulfilling a life-long dream to attend a university in the United States. A convert to the Church twelve years ago, she edited in Buenos Aires a magazine for missionaries and traveled throughout Argentina teaching the gospel.

LAST October 27, Mrs. Ann C. Milne of Salt Lake City reached the age of ninety-nine years. She still attends Relief Society and Daughters of Utah Pioneers meetings, and does housework. Fourteen years ago, an operation restored her eyesight after fifteen years of blindness. She has seventy-seven great-grandchildren.

ISS DORA LOGUE, a teacher in Arlington School, Murray, is one of the first of five Irish exchange teachers to come to America. She is enthusiastic over her work and her experiences in Utah.

"Warm Hearts and Friendly Hands"

Loyalty to the teachings of the gospel shown by one's daily conduct, loyalty to one's family, loyalty to friends and those placed in Church positions of authority, bring to a person the blessings of heaven. In the midst of trials and afflictions, how sweet, how solacing is the loyalty of friends. When the Prophet Joseph Smith was a prisoner in Liberty Jail, the Lord spoke these comforting words: "Thy friends do stand by thee, and they shall hail thee again with warm hearts and friendly hands. Thou art not yet as Job; thy friends do not contend against thee neither charge thee with transgression as they did Job (D&C 121:9-10)." It is a priceless gift to be able to rely on the loyalty of one's associates, to be certain that they will remain staunch and true in adversity. Every president of the Church has been surrounded by associates who would have been loyal to the death. That is an attribute of the Lord's apostles.

In any Church position to which a woman may be called, she owes full loyalty to those placed over her and to those with whom she labors. One of the reasons that the Relief Society is different from every other woman's organization on the face of the earth, is that the leaders are called by men bearing the Holy Priesthood, and seekers of positions are not called. When a woman is chosen for a position, she may expect the full loyalty of all the women with whom she works.

It is a sorrowful thing for a woman to be disloyal to those placed over her, or to be disloyal to those whom she professes to befriend. Those who would dwell in the presence of the Lord and belong to the Church of the Firstborn "see as they are seen, and know as they are known." A sincere woman shuns associating with women whom she knows, from past experience, are disloyal to friends and associates. She knows that each person will have to answer! For every idle word spoken. Said Jesus, "But I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment" (Matt. 12:30).

As a woman increases in years she should increase also in all righteousness. Her appearance, more and more, comes to mirror the spirit within. Sweetness and goodness tend to illumine and refine. At the beginning of this new year, each Relief Society member will earn the approbation of the Lord if she keeps a stricter curb on her tongue, builds up her sisters, and proves her loyalty to friends and principles through her daily living.
