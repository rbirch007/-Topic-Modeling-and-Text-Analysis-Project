Olive W. Burt

Miss Libby Gray, hurrying home with her groceries, had little reason to look about her. It was terrifically hot that midsummer day, and Miss Libby's one desire was to get back to her little cottage, to the shaded coolness of her vine-covered porch. But, as she rounded the corner of Twelfth Street, the billboard across the way struck through her preoccupation, and she stopped and stood there, the sun beating down on her funny little straw hat, as she gaped at the sign.

The circus!

Time again. Miss Libby forgot the heat and the dust as she stared at the gay posters with their galloping horses, lovely women, and heroic men. At last she sighed, and moved on more slowly down the street. She had never seen a circus—never in all her long, drab years. She hadn't even wanted to see one—hadn't even thought about circuses—for a long, long time.

She could remember though, how much they had meant to her at one time. She could remember that summer morning when she was ten. Everyone in the village, it seemed to her, was going to the circus. Teddy James had asked her, "You going to the circus, Libby?" And when she told him that her father wouldn't let her go, Teddy had nodded wisely: "Sure, it's circus mine won't either—that is, he won't give me the money to go. But me and the other fellows are going to carry water for the elephants. Man said he would give us free tickets."

"Oh, Teddy!" Libby had begged, "let me help! Let me carry water, too!"

But it was a boy's job, and there were more boys wanting it than could have it. There was no place for her—a girl. She had stayed home that afternoon, sitting on the side porch, shelling peas, and hearing through the clear, blue summer air the sharp, sweet music of the calliope.

"Papa was just plain stingy!" she said now, and was startled that she had given voice to the hitherto unacknowledged conviction. She felt a little ashamed, too, remembering that this very stinginess was the only thing that had made it possible for her to live as she had all these years, without having to work too hard or worry too much.

She went into her big, cool kitchen and laid her groceries on the table. As she went to put her change into the grocery money can, she gave a little start of surprise.

"Hmmm!" she said, talking half aloud to herself as was her habit, because she was always alone and had no one else to talk to, "I've sure been economical this month. There's more'n two dollars still left in the can."

Two dollars! Papa would have gone straight to the bank with it.

But then, Papa had had to skimp and save for her sake. "But I don't!" she said savagely.

"MISS LIBBY STEPS OUT"

"I haven't a chick nor a child to pass my stuff on to." She stood there, staring at the two dollars, feeling terribly alone. Then, scarcely realizing that she had made a decision, she hurried into her little bedroom and changed her clothes. Glancing furtively over her shoulder as if afraid that Papa might be watching her, she took the change from the grocery money can. "It'll mean I can't have a little roast Sunday," she muttered, but would not let her lips go on to say that this meant no cold meat on Monday and no hash on Tuesday. She shrugged. "Eat too much meat, anyway!" she said.

HE bus to the circus grounds was crowded, but Miss Libby didn't care. She even liked it. She liked standing among the men and women and the jabbering, excited children. Her cheeks felt warm, and she knew her hat was askew, but she kept smiling at everyone and imagined everyone smiled at her.

Once at the circus grounds, she walked slowly, scuffling her feet to stir up little clouds of dust, wanting to feel and hear all the beauty and romance of the place. She bought some pink lemonade and some pink popcorn, and was just going to purchase a ticket to the fat lady side show when caution stopped her.

"Better get my ticket to the Big Top first," she said, her tongue loving the feel of the phrase, "don't know how much it'll cost. Used to be twenty-five cents, but I've grown up since then." Reaching up to get her ticket from the uniformed man, who stood in one end of the red and gold van, was an adventure in itself. The ticket cost $1.50, so Miss Libby couldn't see any side shows. She shrugged. It didn't matter, anyway. The signs and barkers were just as good, maybe even better, than inside.

Up and down the midway she roamed, letting her feet splash in the hot dust, letting her ears drink in the exciting disharmony of raucous-voiced barkers, chattering children, scolding parents, and trumpeting animals. But, at last, she went into the big tent, handed over her ticket, and with the high excitement of a love tryst, entered the dusty, noisy semidarkness.

The animals were even better than Miss Libby had ever imagined. She moved from cage to cage, past the lions pacing sedately to and fro, tossing their manes at each turn; past the tigers and jaguars, beautiful in their lithe grace. She stopped at the monkey cages, laughing aloud with the children beside her. She marvelled at the zebras and llamas, the camels and giraffes, just like their pictures. She watched little boys drop peanuts in the straw for the elephants to find with their long, sensitive trunks.

At last she sighed, gave a last look over the noisy, smelly oval, and went through the flap into the Big Top itself.

"Get reserved seats!" the barker called, and Miss Libby's lips lifted scornfully. Any seat would be a reserved seat to her. She was going to take her time, though, and find the best place. She walked slowly, measuring the advantages of sitting near the reserved seats against those of being at the very end; of sitting in the first row with climbing to the top, where she could, perhaps, see more.

At last she found her place, not too far from the doorway, so she could see the grand entrances, and on the first row. "Tl feel closer to 'em here," she told herself, wriggling her slight figure in among the scuffling little boys. It was wonderful!

From the moment the band began to play and the grand spectacle passed dazzlingly around the big arena, Miss Libby found her two eyes—her five senses—were not enough. She watched the aerialists, the seals and lions and elephants, the bareback riders, the clowns. Particularly, the clowns.

For some reason, it seemed to Miss Libby that here, in the fanciful garb of these crazy tumblers, was the very spirit of the circus—the very heart of the great mystery that had called so urgently to her heart so many, many years ago. The clowns came around the sawdust circle in front of the seats— the giants and the dwarfs, the red-headed clowns and the blackfaced clowns, clowns with ridiculously big feet, and clowns with four feet, and clowns with no feet at all—tumbling, pulling faces, poking at the squealing children on the front row, taking the audience into the fun—into the glory that was the circus.

Miss Libby watched, fascinated. She found herself giggling like the children around her, squealing, too, as a clown let loose a rubber mouse or fell from a kicking burro. Then, right in front of her, a little clown in a red-and-yellow suit began tumbling about, performing unbelievable antics—breaking himself in two, falling together again, while the children clapped, and Miss Libby rose from her seat in her excitement.

At last, the little clown drew himself upright, all in one piece, after all, and bowed sedately. Miss Libby was laughing as she could not remember ever having laughed before, laughing like a little girl, and clapping her hands. The little clown looked straight into Miss Libby's eyes. His own eyes were blue and merry, but as they looked into Miss Libby's brown ones, they grew suddenly serious in his grotesque, painted face. It seemed to Miss Libby that the clown's eyes were speaking to her, were saying something she couldn't quite catch, though her heart stood still for a moment, listening.

Then he bowed again and went running and tumbling out of the tent. The rest of the show seemed a little less exciting now. Miss Libby kept turning from the dazzling aerialists and the performing lions to search among the clowns for that one funny little figure. He didn't come in again, and Miss Libby wondered what he could be doing. Maybe he has other jobs to do, she thought, sadly, and him the best clown they have. It's a shame!

WHEN the circus was over, Miss Libby was pushed out of the tent by the surging crowd around her—out into a sunlight grown drab and a day that held no mystery. She couldn't bear the thought of going home. She walked about among the tents, watching the crowd thin until there were only a few loiterers like herself scattered about. She saw, at one side of the big field, a long tent, and smelled the odors of cooking that came from it. Stiffening her backbone and giving her timidity a mental shaking, she walked toward it.

Her courage fading, the wrong figure came toward the cook-tent. Miss Libby recognized him at once—not from his face, which was no longer grotesque, but was friendly and human; not from his clothes, which were ordinary gray slacks and shirt, but from the quick, precise movements and the blue, merry eyes.
Miss Libby stared. That's how a clown looks in real life! she thought, and she envied him the paint and clothes that were his transport into wonderland.
"Oh, Mister!" she cried, before she knew it.
The little man stopped, looked at her sharply, and nodded.
"Good evening, ma'am," he answered.
Miss Libby's words came straight from her heart, not waiting to be censored by her mind or her sense of propriety.
"Oh, Mr. Clown, I thought you were the best thing in the whole circus! I never saw anything like you. Would you�" Now
she began to stumble. "Would you read this? I've read about�"
The little man came close to her. He was smiling and his eyes looked happy.
"Yeah," he said, "I saw you there—in the front row, you were, weren't you? Not many ladies sit there—mostly kids. So you liked my act, eh?"
"Oh, yes!" she breathed. "It was marvelous. I—I waited here hoping I would see you so I could tell you�"
"That's mighty nice of you, ma'am," the man said, and there was all of the circus in his voice. "Mighty nice! Not many people do that any more."
Miss Libby was fumbling in her bag. She brought out a little card and a stub of a pencil.
"Would you," she began, and then went on apologetically, "I've never had anyone's autograph—I never wanted one before—but if you only would—I could sort of look at it and remember�"
She was holding out the little white square with an unconsciously pleading gesture.
The little man surely beamed at her unbelievably. Then his eyes grew suddenly bright, and his voice shook a little as he asked, "You mean—do I mean you want my autograph? Say, lady—" The little circus man took the card from her. He stood staring at it for a moment, and then asked gently, "What is your name, Lady?"
Miss Libby told him, and he lifted his pencil. He cried, "I never saw anyone like you. Would you—" Now the unbelievable sight—of a little gray-clad figure standing firmly on one leg, writing upon an uplifted knee. It was better than the circus, itself. When he had finished, he handed her the card, with a deep bow.
"There you are, Madame," he said, and Miss Libby felt herself grow tall and lovely. "And thank you. You have made me very happy." Made you happy?" she whispered, and stared after him as he went into the tent. Then she looked at the card, holding it close to her eyes to read in the fading afternoon light: To Miss Libby Gray—the greatest little lady that ever watched me perform, with deep appreciation for her kind heart. Roy, the Clown.
Miss Libby went home, now. Her day was over. She put the card in the corner of her dresser looking glass, and long after she had stretched out in bed, the little square twinkled and smiled at her, and the memory of happiness was sweet around her.

A NEW YEAR
Clarence Edwin Flynn

Isn't it good to put by the fears
And cares and worries of all the years;
To take the debits of sorrows known,
The strifes and wrongs of the days agone,
The unkind words and the unkind looks
Together, and charge them off the books?

Isn't it good to have a day
To put the wrongs and mistakes away,
The disappointments and failures,
Too, and let the thought of them all be through,
To close the page on the hurt and strife,
And open a new account with life?
