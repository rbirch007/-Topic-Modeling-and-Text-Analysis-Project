Storing Food in a Two-Room Apartment Esther Clark Naylor

In the matter of storing food in my small, heated apartment I have been rather successful. To do this I have had to use care, when the heat was on in the winter months, to select an outside wall or corner of the rooms where there are no heated pipes in the wall or the floor, to stack the cases of food against the wall or in the corner.

Then in the summertime the food should be moved to an inside wall or closet, the coolest place in the room.

In this way I have been able to keep the food until it was used up, usually from two to three years. I make my plans to store a two-year supply every summer.

The canned foods stored consist of string beans, peas, corn, tomatoes (if I do not home can the tomatoes), tomato soup, vegetable soup, grapefruit, canned milk, and honey, with some canned meat and fish. The canned milk should be turned over every week or two. By doing this, milk can be kept for at least one year. Of course, dried beans and rice will keep indefinitely. I am now using beans and rice that were purchased about six years ago. However, the rice must be watched to avoid the weevil getting into it. I think the sealed package would be the safest, although I have been successful in storing the loose rice, by putting it in very thick paper bags and placing these bags in a very heavy seamless sack and tying each sack tightly.

Butter also can be stored for at least one year if kept in sealed bottles in the refrigerator. Before storing, melt the butter over heat that is hot enough to send the curd or whey to the bottom and then pour the pure butter fat into a well-sterilized bottle, and seal. Care should be taken that no curd goes into the bottle. There is no waste in this method, as the curd or whey can be used in cookie making.

In storing home-canned fruits, such as peaches, applesauce, plums, etc., I have used the same method of storage as for the storage of canned foods. I keep one year's supply ahead, sometimes more. The jams and jellies I store in my cupboards, but I always seal the jams as I do the fresh fruit.

I haven't been very successful in storing cheese for a very long period of time. I have kept flour successfully by lining a wall behind a door with brown paper and stacking flour in sacks, surrounding each sack with brown paper. It kept for over a year.

In planning a storage for a single person in a two-room apartment it is helpful to estimate food needs. A can of peas will last for four meals; a one-quart bottle of fruit will last for five meals; a large can of tomatoes will provide a serving for each of five meals.

Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, August 1, and August 15, 1888
"For THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN OF ZION AND THE RIGHTS OF THE Women oF ALL NaTIONs"
THE TWENTY-FOURTH: The commemoration of the anniversary of the entrance of the Pioneers into this valley was celebrated last month with appropriate services in the large Tabernacle, an immense concourse of people being in attendance. It was forty-one years since the company of Pioneers arrived where Salt Lake City now stands. The grand organ was handsomely draped with the stars and stripes, and a steel engraving of President Brigham Young hung in the centre among the national colors. Underneath it a banner bore the one word "Unity." The three stands were draped with national flags, and the platform in front of the stands, used on such occasions, was tastefully ornamented with flowers and plants in bloom. On one side was the head and horns of a buffalo, with its long, shaggy hair, and on the other the very old flag of stars and stripes, that was flung out to the mountain breeze from Ensign Peak on their first visit to the mountains, two days after their arrival.

APPRECIATION: I have been very much gratified with the literary attainments and pleasant tone of the editorials in your paper. I have certainly a very different idea of the trials and struggles of the Mormon Pioneers, from what I had before. I wanted to know the standing of the women rights' advocates, among your people, and I have been gratified indeed.

Fair are the flowers and the children, but their subtle suggestion is fairer; Rare is the rose burst of dawn, but the secret that clasps it is rarer. Sweet the exultance of song, but the strain that precedes it is sweeter, And never was the poem yet writ, but the meaning out-mastered the metre.

NOTES AND NEWS: The announcement that Louisa M. Alcott's home at Concord, Mass., is to be sold, leads to the suggestion that it be bought by subscription and converted into a home for poor children, as a memorial to the author so well beloved by young readers.

MARICOPA STAKE: Minutes of the Relief Society Conference of Maricopa Stake, held at the Bowery, Mesa City June 21st, 1888, Elizabeth G. McDonald presiding. The different branches of the Society were well represented; there were a number of the brethren also present. Coun. Morris said, "Let us go to the Lord for strength to carry us through our trials." Felt to respond cheerfully to every call made upon her. Prest. Charles I. Robson felt the importance of the times we are living in; thought the day was near at hand when the reign of righteousness would commerce upon the earth. Prest. E. McDonald felt that we had truly had a feast. Gave counsel to the sisters to have a care in their remarks before their children. "Be careful how you speak of your neighbors before them." Asked the Lord's blessings upon us, that we might increase in good works.

EDITORIAL NOTES: The Deseret University, with its facilities for education, its modern improvements, the delightful grounds, and the suitable situation, enclosed, as it is, and shaded on all sides, is, indeed, a desirable locality for such an institution. It has the advantage, also, of an able Faculty, and ought to rank high as a seat of learning.

WOMEN are trying to correct some important misfortunes among the nations of the world. They became increasingly cognizant of these ills at the last meeting of the International Council of Women in Philadelphia, toward the end of last year. They learned that some countries have very unsanitary milk and some countries have no milk. In at least fifteen nations women are not yet allowed to vote. In Poland live 600,000 orphan children born out of wedlock during the war. The women are working to carry out a three-year program dealing with peace, health, relief, and education.

JARRELL, only woman school superintendent in a United States city of more than 200,000 population, occupies that position in Atlanta, Georgia. When she began teaching, she asked to work with the underprivileged children. She has introduced many reforms into the conservative Atlanta schools, among them the startling innovation of coeducation.

FRANCES CLEVELAND, as the bride of Grover Cleveland, was the youngest First Lady in the United States. Since her recent death at 88, only five former Presidents' wives still live.

"A Friend Loveth at All Times" (Proverbs 17:7)
A young mother dropped wearily into a chair, almost holding her breath lest her fretful baby awaken and demand attention. The small room in which the mother sat was clean and neat, but through the crack of a half-opened door could be glimpsed the bedroom where the baby slept, in which was an unmade bed and toys and clothing strewn about. If only the baby were a sound sleeper, the mother thought, so she could clean the room while he slept. She relaxed for a moment letting her lids close after the hard work of the morning's wash. She was aroused by a light tapping at her apartment door. Silently opening the door, she beheld her next-door neighbor, a dear friend, standing with a welcoming smile on her face. "I know you're dead tired," she whispered, "with the baby crying so much in the night. I've come to stay while you get some fresh air. Just leave everything the way it is and put on your coat and go," she coaxed.
Because of the genuine concern mirrored in her friend's eyes, the mother gratefully accepted the offer. In a few minutes she was enjoying the brisk air, slowly drawing back into her body a sense of peace and relaxation to strengthen her for the further cares of the day.
A friend! What an outpouring of love and unselfish devotion the word expresses. In the midst of sorrow, of suffering and trouble, the strength of friendship will sustain and provide a protecting mantle against the shades of darkness and despair.
Friendship, however, to grow and become stronger than adversity, needs tender care and cultivation nourished with appreciation and understanding. Both parties to a friendship must unselfishly serve. It will be but a precarious friendship where all the giving is on one side and the taking on the other. Everyone who would be a friend has something to offer, for the giving of oneself, of one's talents, encouragement, and gratitude, far outweigh material gifts.
Love begets love and the more one gives the more one has to give. One person departs, leaving scarcely a remembrance behind. Another leaves and almost each hour of every day a nostalgic memory arises. The difference may largely be accounted for by the amount of service performed by the two, by the expression of their friendship.
It is blessed to be a friend; it is blessed to have a friend. Both conditions require doing and not mere being. All the effort expended is more than repaid for. "A friend loveth at all times," and will be dearly prized even after death comes.

Notes TO THE FIELD
Annual Stake Conventions Set
RELIEF Society annual stake conventions will begin in August and run through November. The conventions have been planned to occupy one day and will begin with a stake board meeting at 10 A.M., conducted by the home stake Relief Society president. Matters of importance to stake boards will be considered in this meeting and the discussion will be led by representatives from the Relief Society general board.
An officers and class leaders meeting will be held from 11 A.M. to 12:45 P.M. for stake board members, ward presidencies, secretary-treasurers, class leaders, and work meeting leaders. Members of the stake presidency, high council, and bishoprics are also invited to this meeting. Following the opening exercises and remarks from Relief Society officers, two departmental meetings will be held: (1) for presidencies, secretary-treasurers, magazine representatives; (2) for class leaders.
A general session is scheduled for the afternoon, to be conducted by the visiting stake Relief Society president. Stake and ward officers and class leaders are to attend the meeting, and priesthood representatives and visiting teachers are invited.

Annual Relief Society General Conference September 29 and 30, 1948
PLANS are well underway for the annual Relief Society general conference to be held on Wednesday and Thursday, September 29 and 30, 1948, immediately preceding the Church semi-annual general conference.
The plan for the Relief Society general conference calls for a morning officers meeting in the Assembly Hall for stake board members on Wednesday, with departmental meetings to be held simultaneously in the afternoon. A reception which stake board members and mission Relief Society presidents will be invited will be held in the evening at the Hotel Utah.
Both meetings on Thursday will convene in the Tabernacle and be open to the general public.
The morning session from 10 A.M. to 12 noon will feature the conclusion of the Relief Society Building Fund program. It is expected that an official representative of every stake and mission achieving 100% or more of its Building Fund quota will be present and recognition given them. Gold bands to be worn by the official representatives, lettered with the name of the stake or mission, will soon be sent to the stakes on their hav-

The 534 completed their quotas. The conference will be a time of rejoicing to the sisters everywhere. The afternoon session in the Tabernacle will be addressed by members of the general authorities, and Relief Society general board members. This conference will be remembered as one of the most memorable occasions in the history of Relief Society, and it is the earnest hope of the general board that great numbers of Relief Society members from faraway as well as nearby may be in attendance.

Stake presidents are requested to have their ward presidents announce the conference at the Relief Society summer meetings. Heat Waves and Salad Days
Elizabeth Williamson

URING the hot summer do eat outdoors if you possibly can. To entertain your friends, but don't let the weather get you down. With a little psychology and hardly any exertion you can serve a delicious luncheon and make your guests forget the hot weather. And as red and yellow give one a sense of warmth in winter, green and white give one a feeling of coolness in summer. Try to plan your menu and table decorations with cool colors in mind.

MENU
CHILLED SOUP This can be consomme, served with a slice of lemon, or perhaps a cold pea soup served with a sprinkling of parsley.
LARGE FRUIT SALAD Serve in individual wooden bowls or large, deep dishes. On a bed of chilled crisp lettuce, heap: chilled white grapes, chunks of pineapple, green melon balls, pieces of grapefruit, and avocado if you choose (it is a fruit and goes equally well with fruits or vegetables). Crisp and cold.
REMEMBER that to have a successful salad, the greens must always be
DRESSING FOR THE SALAD Use mayonnaise to which has been added whipped cream, or mayonnaise thinned with a small amount of fruit juices.

BREAD Serve hot rolls or tiny baking powder biscuits which can be prepared ready for baking earlier (in the cool of the morning). Or you may buy a prepared mixture for making delightful little buttermilk biscuits that pop out of the container into the oven.

If it seems too much of a task to make hot bread, you can serve small water-cress sandwiches 534 days it often seems an effort. Color plays a leading role. Just HEAT WAVES AND SALAD DAYS 535 sandwiches. Add a small amount of mayonnaise to the chopped water cress. Be sure to cut off the crusts of the bread. These little sandwiches are especially refreshing and are wonderful for an afternoon refreshment as well as a luncheon. DESSERT Prepare a frosty sherbet, either lemon or orange. Use the fresh fruit juices and the grated rind. Just add two cups of milk and a cup of granulated sugar or a cup of Karo syrup. Place in your refrigerator trays until it is solid, then remove and stir until very smooth. Return the sherbet to the refrigerator, and this time do not let it freeze, but keep it rather at a mushy but firm consistency. A REFRESHING DRINK Serve a frosty, tall drink and add a piece of mint for garnish. TABLE DECORATIONS Use the flowers in season, or branches of green leaves are effective. A centerpiece of bright yellow lemons with green leaves is unusual and striking. Place this centerpiece directly on the table and not in a container. It will be cool-looking and practical. And last, but certainly not least, as a charming hostess, remember you, too, must appear fresh and cool-looking. Your guests will relax and you will have a wonderful time. Synopsis: Andrew Rumgay leaves his mother and his fiancée Jane Alhson in Scotland and joins his friend Hugh Shand to emigrate to America. They meet Mother MacKinlay and her son Bob, whom they had known while doing missionary work, and become acquainted with Kathleen Coleman and her friend Margaret Purvis. Hugh and Kathleen are married on board the ship. While in Iowa, preparing for the handcart journey across the plains, Margaret tells Mother Mac that she is in love with Andrew, and Kathleen tells the two women that she is expecting a baby. They journey on and survive the autumn storms. Andrew is missing one night and Margaret goes to his rescue and brings him back safely. The Saints in Zion send food to them, and Margaret leaves the Macs to go with Brother Brown to Tooele, Utah. Isn't it wonderful, Andrew? If my home in heaven is this grand, I'll be satisfied." Yes, Mother," slowly affirmed the young man. "I think I get what you mean. You will need a few more rooms in your mansion, but on the whole I think you can manage with this one for a time." Your large rooms, with shelves built in the kitchen and in the bedrooms; the well is here on the east side; the woodhouse is around the back," she enumerated, pointing out to Andrew the advantages of her new home. Do you see how the mountains rise from my very doorstep? When I'm not busy I will sit by the window and study the mountains. I will never be lonesome with all this beauty around me." "You never would be lonesome, anyway," Andrew said, looking into Mother Mac's calm blue eyes. "But, Page 536 for sure, this is the most beautiful spot I've ever seen." The rugged mountains, towering majestically into the clear blue skies, were beautiful in every tint and coloring of the spring. The sunshine glistened on stately trees, and danced with every shrub and flower in the soft-bedded nooks and glades of the sidehill. Mother turned to the west and looked for a long time at the shimmering beauty of the silvery blue fresh-water lake—a mirror, reflecting all of the radiance and grandeur of its surroundings. The river, singing on its way through the high green valleys, down over rocky crags and precipices, had found, at last, a soft loamy bed on the last lap of its journey before losing itself in the still, gleaming waters of the lake. The only thing out of harmony with the beauty of the valley was the fort. "It is such a pity that men have to build places of safety for themselves and families," Mother Mac said, reflectively. "We may be very glad to accept its security!" Andrew was rapidly becoming acquainted with both the opportunities and the dangers of the new home in the West. "I'm not seeking any interviews with the red men." Mother Mac looked anxiously toward the mountains. "I remember them only too well on the plains. They never did find that young boy who was stolen from our company. How I sympathize with his poor mother and relations." QUESTING LIGHTS "We had to be constantly on the alert, or they would have taken others." Andrew remembered his own fears on that memorable night when he was lost in the blizzard. "Well, my son, we have been greatly blessed of the Lord, since coming to Utah. You have a good job with the Hunters; Hugh and Kathleen and Father Coleman have rented a place for the time being, and I'm waiting for my money to come from Scotland, to finish paying for my home." "We're lucky, indeed," very thoughtfully returned the young man. UGH and Kathleen came to see the new home. They were interested in every feature which Mother was constantly adding. They went into the living room. It had been a long time since they had all been together. Mother wanted them to stay for dinner, so Bob went for Brother Coleman. "What have you been hearing from Jane, Andrew?" Kathleen asked as she began preparing the vegetables. "Does your mail come through any better?" "I haven't heard for sometime, but she doesn't hear from me, either. These twenty-five-cent pieces in American silver are very hard for me to find. I write every time I get one, but sometimes there is a long wait between letters. I have explained everything to Jane, and I'm sure she understands. I'll be very happy when the little lady arrives in Utah. I get so lonesome that even Resplendence, this valley of sunshine and enchantment, gets very dark and dreary at times. "I remember Jane!" Bob volunteered. "I saw her at conference in Cowdenbeath. Remember?" Andrew smiled assent. "She was just about the prettiest girl at church," Bob continued. "She had long, golden curls and sparkling blue eyes. She wasn't quite as tall as you are, but one thing I definitely remember, Jane was always smiling. Life must have been very good to that little bonnie lass." "I hope she still has her curls, and smiles," Andrew remarked, with a faraway look in his eyes. OTHER came out from the kitchen. "The problems of the plains are still with us. What shall we do for chairs? Oh, Bob! The boxes in the woodhouse! I bought them for kindling this morning. Now they will make dining room chairs, for a time." Mother smiled. She bustled around, completing the last-minute details. "Dinner is served, my children. It is like old times, isn't it? We must do this often. My latch strings are always out." "Well, in some ways, it is like old times," Andrew offered. "I always miss Margaret at these gatherings."

Does she write often? What is she doing?" "No, not very often. She's too busy," Mother answered, with a questioning glance at Andrew. "Wasn't it strange for Margaret to leave us so suddenly, and go to the Stuarts in Tooele?" Father Coleman asked. "No, not when you know the whole story," Mother explained. "Margaret was as close to Grandpa Stuart and Grandma Stuart as if she had been their own child. She was their daughter Betsey's best friend. They worked together at the flax mills in Arbroath. Grandpa Stuart taught Margaret the gospel, and baptized her. When her own people learned that Margaret was a Mormon they were very unhappy about it. She stayed with the Stuarts until they emigrated to Utah. A short time after they left, Margaret's mother died. She worked and paid all the funeral expenses because her brothers were married and had large families. Then she worked for her fare to Zion. I'm grateful she came in our company, even if we did have such a hard time of it. We are honored that she thought enough of us to become a Mac." "What is she doing now?" Andrew asked. "'m just as sure she is being loved and cared for as if I had her in my own home. She is old enough to make her own decisions and we must abide by them. I had a letter sometime ago, Grandpa Stuart's son is manager of the co-op out there, and Margaret is working in the store. A very good saleslady she is making, I am sure." "There are a lot of good people in Utah, judging by those I am meeting every day in Resplendence." Hugh spoke very earnestly. "Look what happened the day we got in from the plains. In one hour about five hundred people were taken into Salt Lake City homes and made comfortable. 'That was wonderful! Sure, Margaret is all right." "If you want an example of one of the best men in the valley, take my boss," Andrew began. "He told me that when I get tired, he wants me to rest till I get my weight and strength back. Sister Hunter cooks the meals that are good for us, and that isn't all, Brother Hunter has learned about Jane." The Macs got a good laugh from this one. "We thought maybe he would," Kathleen ventured. "Forgive me, Andrew." "Oh! That's all right, Kathleen. He didn't hear it from me," Andrew remarked with a smile. "No, he keeps all of his thoughts of Jane locked up in his own kind heart," Mother proffered. "Well, I may have told him, at that," chuckled Andrew, "but, getting back, Brother Hunter thinks working for wages is too slow. He wants me to raise wheat. I can't homestead until I'm a citizen, but he has a plan. I would like to homestead down on the river bottoms some day. They get the water out on the land so easy over there." Hugh voiced his hopes that some day he could raise fruit on the bench. "The soil is a large part sand, ideal for raising fruit." "That's life!" Brother Coleman allowed. "Andrew, with hay and grain on the bottoms; Hugh, with his peach and apple orchards on the bench." "Well, we can dream, can't we, Father?" "Yes, my son, we build our lives on dreams. Stop dreaming, and we stop growing." "Utah's a land of dreams." Andrew was unusually thoughtful today. "But the best dream of all is still in Scotland, waiting for the boat," Bob suggested. "Which brings us right back to QUESTING LIGHTS the Mac question number one," Hugh reckoned. "How to get the young lady across the water?" EVERY hour Mother could spare from her work she spent with Kathleen. So much time had passed by when Kathleen couldn't work because of the coming of her baby that she was very busy now. Hugh and Father Coleman had built the furniture. The rugs, curtains, and bedding Kathleen made herself. Now the little clothes were all about finished. One night in the spring Hugh came for Mother. As morning softly descended upon the peaceful village of Resplendence, Kathleen presented her husband with a beautiful baby boy. It was decided to name him Mac Coleman Shand. "That should make him very happy all the days of his life, for to me the name is very sacred," Kathleen explained. "It's what the name stands for that appeals to me—love, service, and understanding that came after days of traveling and suffering together on the plains." The fulfillment of dreams calls for work, hard work. Andrew was strong again. He accepted no more leniency on his job. Brother Hunter and the young man spent several days on the river bottoms looking for land where Andrew could raise wheat, and where, later, he could homestead. They found land as level as a barn floor, with hardly a rock on an acre, and with a thriving crop of good sagebrush. Brother Hunter furnished the team, equipment, and seed grain for planting. When Andrew spoke of paying him in the fall, Brother Hunter said, "My pay will come when I see your homestead covered with growing crops, with a home, and a wife to take care of you." The spring work was completed, the seeds were in their soft cradles. The rains were falling to start the miracle of germination and growth. The people in the valley turned their cattle out to feed in the bottoms and on the foothills. Andrew would have to stay with the grain night and day. There were no fences. One morning, after a rainstorm, the whole field seemed suddenly to turn green. Wonders upon wonders, the crop was up! Andrew wanted to tush over to the Macs and the Hunters to tell them the great news, but he could not leave the wheat. Instead, he wrote a letter to Jane. Jane Darling, The crop is up! Oh, how I wish you were here to see it. The whole field is green. I am sure every seed has sprouted, which means that in the fall I can sell the grain and send the money for you to come to Resplendence. 'That is, and here's the rub, if I can get any money. There just isn't any in these western regions, but we will hope, Jane. The rain is falling, making this the most beautiful valley in the whole world. I have decided to build our home on the millrace, a canal that has been cut through from the canyon to furnish power for a flour mill and a factory which the people are going to build. 'I remember the singing streams in Scotland, and the paths we used to climb up the hillside towards the pits, also a very charming young lady with a heart of gold. I met her at school. I couldn't go very long, but long enough to find you, my darling. Oh! Oh! The strays are coming. I will have to get on my black pony, Gypsy, and drive them away. More tonight. I love you, Jane.

Andrew (To be continued) Aunt Millenium's Deone'R Sutherland 6

THE proposition is at any rate an interesting one," said Papa, crossing his legs so that one thin knee jutted up balancing a green, leather-covered book and an open letter above that. "Well," said Mama, "a great-aunt is a great-aunt." This remark my younger brother Toby and I considered at length. Papa is usually a school teacher and is a man who has read a great many books, but who has spent very little time at the farm of his Aunt Millenium. Our great-aunt has the distinction of having Millenium for a first name. "I'm sure it will be very simple for all of us to become acclimated to a farm, at least for a summer," said Papa. "Aunt Millenium most certainly cannot stay on _ there alone." "Most certainly not," said Mama, who is always saying she agrees with Papa about everything except those things which are practical. If she at this time thought our stay on a farm and our turning farmers out of the realm of the practical, she was undoubtedly right. "And then Lavinia Elizabeth can live with us there and continue working on her uh whatever it is," said my mother, talking about my older sister. "The Bifurcated Existence of the Elizabethans," supplied Toby, who is very precocious for his age. "Yes," said Mama, nodding, "she can finish it on the farm." I chewed on my hair. It was supposed to be cut wind-blown, but it was cut so infrequently that often the front locks, when I leaned forward, could be stretched to my mouth. Papa said it would all lead to nearsightedness in the end.

RK * & BOCSVILLE, where Great-Aunt Millenium lives, gets very muddy in the spring. Papa stopped our gray Ford at the Bogsville Combination Depot and Feed Store and stepped out of the car into the mud. "Oh my," said Papa, and we all looked away as we heard the suction noise of Papa pulling out his feet. "Quite a bit of mud this time of year," called Papa to a man leaning in the doorway of the depot. "Some," said the man. "We're wondering if we can get through to it's the place Aunt -... Papa's voice faded away in the distance. "The man does not seem very friendly," I observed to Mama, as Papa made inquiries. "It would be nicer if there were more trees,"' said Lavinia Elizabeth, leaning toward the Sunny car window and squinting through her glasses while holding her place in her book with one hand. "Well, of course," said Toby, "the deciduous trees have not fully leafed as yet." "No, they haven't, have they, as yet?" agreed Mama brightly. We could tell she was trying to keep up our spirits. Mama can be very courageous.

Lavinia Elizabeth looked at Toby, and then she picked up her book AUNT MILLENIUM's again. 541 Just then Papa came slush-ing back to the car.
"Did you get muddy?" asked Toby. Mama frowned at Toby.
"Oh, it was nothing, really," Papa tried furtively to scrape his shoes on the running-board. We pretended not to notice. Papa looked very apologetic. He was being very humble because he was feeling guilty. Toby and I knew. He had, at the last minute, taken out two of his white shirts and replaced them with a volume of Restoration Plays, even though boxes of his books were coming by express. The only time Mama had ever really got angry about Papa's peculiar way of packing was the time he had substituted three volumes of Victorian poetry for Mama's two nightgowns and best blue serge.

"So this is Bogsville," said Mama.
Lavinia Elizabeth looked up from her book. "At any rate," she said, "I'll be quite isolated enough to finish my part of the book. I'll be able to concentrate."

GREAT-Aunt Millenium came out on her back porch to meet us. Our car slued and then mired itself at the end of her boardwalk. We got out of the car and started carrying in our things to Aunt Millenium's house.

Papa left his shoes by the scraper and walked around in his stocking feet. We had the three bedrooms upstairs. Lavinia Elizabeth and I were to share a room.
"This will be rather inconvenient," said Lavinia Elizabeth.
"You'll have to learn to be neat," said Mama to me.
I did not say anything. Lavinia is very smart, and I am very shy and uncouraegous around very smart people—especially my sister who is collaborating on a book with two men, a graduate student like herself, and a college teacher.

"How old are you?" said Great-Aunt Millenium to Lavinia Elizabeth.
"I'm only twenty-five," said my sister. Everyone said it was quite wonderful of Lavinia Elizabeth to be only twenty-five and to have done so much.
"Twenty-five and nothing but a book to your credit! What's he like, the one who's a graduate student, Lavinia Elizabeth?" asked Great-Aunt Millenium.
"He is brilliant," answered my sister, "and he thinks I have a good mind." Lavinia looked down at her feet. Her glasses slid forward on her nose.

"My word," said Great-Aunt Millenium, "is that all? It must be the way you do your hair. I've got a magazine that tells you if you want an uplift—Don't you ever notice what's in that kind of magazines?"
"I never read that kind of literature," replied Lavinia Elizabeth, pushing up her glasses.

"My word!" said Aunt Millenium. Papa coughed very loudly, and Mama began to ask about dinner. Toby and I stared at Great-Aunt Millenium.
"You can go fishing here, if you go after your own worms," Great-Aunt Millenium said to Toby.
"Oh," said Toby, "I don't think I'd care for worms."
"That's something Toby's never had the opportunity to do," said Papa. "My word!" Millenium. Said Great-Aunt

THE next morning we got up very early. All of us except Lavinia Elizabeth were to help on the farm, and even she was to help when we needed her. Great-Aunt Millenium had a hired hand for whom, later in the summer, she said she was extremely grateful. Papa had ordered winter wheat for Great-Aunt Millenium before we came, and then he and Mama had picked up one or two other things from which they expected to make a lot of money. All in all, it was to be a very growing summer.

Great-Aunt Millenium's hired hand waited in the kitchen for Papa. "This is Jake," said Great Aunt Millenium to Papa. Jake grunted slightly. "How do you do," said Papa. Toby and I looked at each other. Papa did not look very much like a farmer. Jake did not seem to be too impressed, either. They were going to do something to fence posts, Jake said. Papa followed Jake. We hoped it wouldn't take Papa too long to get acclimated. Toby and I went outside. We stopped by some bright yellow crocuses. 'They bloomed down at the end of the yard. Beyond them a clay wash stretched downhill, yellow and muddy. We looked at the crocuses. Great-Aunt Millenium stood behind us.

She smiled and Toby let her put her hand on his head. The sun was bright. It was a good summer, we decided. Mama said she would help also. She would help with the farming.

"The farm animals?" asked Great Aunt Millenium.
"Well, perhaps not the big farm animals," said Mama hesitantly.
"The chickens," decided Aunt Millenium.
Toby and I were to feed them and Mama was to collect the eggs. Mama was very enthusiastic.

After we fed them that afternoon, Mama went in with her basket. In a little while we heard Mama say, "Shoo," very fiercely and then again, "Shoo." Then the door opened and Mama came out of the hen coop. She went down to the shed where Jake kept the tools for the farm. In a moment she came out with the bee veiling and long leather gloves that Jake used when disturbing the bees.

"The chickens refuse to get off the nests," she said to Lavinia Elizabeth and me. She adjusted the long, four-sided veiling and pulled down the veils.

When Papa saw Mama in her egg gathering costume, he stopped and opened his mouth and then closed it.

"IT am having a little trouble getting acclimated to the chickens," said Mama in a slightly defensive, but slightly bitter tone. She set down the evening bucket of eggs and peered through the thick veiling at Papa.
"It's the chickens  they cluck at me...."

Papa said he thought her new green hat with the net and spangles would be as effective in the long run, but Mama continued using the bee veiling and leather gloves.

Papa's books came, but Papa had very little time to look at them. He brought down a bookcase from the attic and put it up, filled with his books, in Great-Aunt Millenium's parlor. He would run his hands along the backs of the books and then go to sleep.
"It is amazing how much sleep I wish I had more of," said Papa.

Papa's seeds and other orders came. He had a surprise for Great Aunt Millenium.
"It's peanuts," said Papa.
"We'll plow up that empty pasture and plant peanuts."
Papa's aunt stared at him.
"Then she said, "Well, Henry, I doubt if this is exactly the climate for peanuts." 
"It'll be all right if we have a late fall," said Papa. He was very eager.

Great-Aunt Millenium didn't say very much after that, but Jake would not co-operate.
"I don't want to have nothin' to do with it," said Jake.
So Papa spent a great deal of time planting his peanuts all by himself. Toby and I would go out and watch him sometimes. This work made him even more tired, he said.

Mama said, "Well, you can always plant another pasture."
Jake would only look very glum. He looked very glum most of the summer.
"I�m worried about Lavinia Elizabeth," said Great-Aunt Millenium.
"She don't get out enough."

WHEN the first crop of hay came on, we all went out on the wagons.
"But I don't have anything to wear," said Lavinia Elizabeth,
"besides"
"You're way ahead of schedule," said Mama.
"Besides Aunt Millenium thinks you're too pale."
She wore Jake's overalls with a belt around the middle
"'to hold her in 'em," as Great-Aunt Millenium 543 said.

Toby drove the wagon, and Lavinia Elizabeth and I tramped and settled the hay.
"Stack it!" Jake would yell, and Lavinia and I would run about on top the hay.
"I�m never sure exactly just what we're supposed to be doing," Lavina confided to me.
I felt very close and friendly toward her. We both worked very hard, but not as hard as Papa, who had a difficult time landing the piles of hay on the wagon.

Toby got along fine with the horses after he gave up saying "halt" to them and consented to yell "whoa!" Then one hot afternoon we came riding into the yard on the top of a load of hay and noticed a strange car in the backyard. Great-Aunt Millenium and Mama were in the backyard talking to a man.
"It's Andrew Nichols," said Lavina Elizabeth, and she lay flat on the hay.
"Cover me up," she said. It was a collaborator on her book, the younger one. I had seen him at home once or twice.

"Where's Lavinia Elizabeth?" yelled Great-Aunt Millenium.
Jake stopped the team.
"Here!" Lavinia Elizabeth stood up in the hay. She picked at the hay leaves in her hair.
"How do you do again," called Andrew from down below. He looked very surprised.
"Can I help you get down?"
Lavinia Elizabeth lay on her back on the hay and Papa and I held her arms as she slid.
Andrew caught her.
"Thank you, Andrew," said Lavinia Elizabeth with great dignity. She shook out her hair. She looked very small in Jake's big overalls with the belt around the middle. She did not look the way she usually seemed to look�not at all.

"I came back about the book�I wanted to go over some things . . . ." Andrew looked a little vague.
"And he came to see you," Aunt Millenium spoke heartily.
Andrew and, "yes," then he said "yes" again in a different way, and looked very pleased.
"Oh!" said Lavinia Elizabeth and she put on her glasses and stared at him.

Jake started the horses, and we went to the barn to unload.

Andrew shared Toby's room. He and Lavinia Elizabeth worked very hard on the book.
"About the chaos of the Copernican age . . ." began Lavinia Elizabeth.
"You look very different with a sun-tan," interrupted Andrew.

They had put a table on the back porch and were working there.
"I'm very pleased about the book," said Great-Aunt Millenium.

After supper one night, Great-Aunt Millenium came up to our room. "I'll help you with your hair," she said to Lavinia. Lavinia Elizabeth looked very young in her nightgown, sitting on her bare feet.
"How is your book progressing?"
"Well," said Lavinia Elizabeth, "the book . . . well, the book is fine, I guess." Then she got up and kissed Great-Aunt Millenium on the cheek. "I don't know exactly what's progressing," she said and her cheeks looked very red.

WELL,
"There should be more box-elders than this with those peanuts," said Papa.
He had turned very brown in the sun also.
"It beats me," he said.

"Say," said Papa to Aunt Millenium, "is Jake always this taciturn?"
"Well, he don't talk more than most of the people here."
"You know," said Andrew, "the first Sunday we went to church after I arrived, the bishop said this town was more like New England than any place in the West. The people are lovable only after you know them."
"I believe it," said Papa, "at any rate, the put about New England." He yawned.
"If I'm not hungry, I'm sleepy."

They'll never know me this fall back at school."
"Well, none of us are very pale any more," said Mama, through her mask of cold cream which she seemed to wear a great deal of the time. "I'd wear this in the coop, but the effect might be fatal," she said.
Andrew and Lavinia Elizabeth went out for walks often after dinner. One evening they came into the house and into the parlor where we were all sitting.
"We've been out for some fresh air, Elizabeth and I," said Andrew.
"There is certainly a lot of fresh air outside," he added heartily.
Lavinia Elizabeth and Andrew went to find it more and more difficult to make conversation with us," remarked Papa.
Great-Aunt Millenium smiled while she tatted. She rubbed her cat with her foot. "It'll be different after he ask you for her," said Great-Aunt Millenium.
"Oh," I said looking up, "is it a kind of a secret now?" AUNT MILLENIUM'S I had been reading a great many of Great-Aunt Millenium's hidden novels. "Oh," I repeated. "Oh!" said Papa. Mama smiled at Aunt Millenium through her cold cream. Toby yawned. The summer was nearly over, and we all decided the peanut crop was a failure, even though Papa had had a triumphant afternoon when the plants had really sprouted. The only trouble was the peanuts at the other end had failed to materialize as they did in the picture. "Not enough time, I guess," said Papa moodily. He had had to take a great many comments from the townspeople who frequently stopped to inspect his peanut crop. The book was finished, yet Andrew kept hanging around. "He's getting up the courage," said Great-Aunt Millenium. "Well, I wish he'd hurry," said Papa, "the whole thing makes me very nervous." Lavinia Elizabeth would sit before our mirror after we were supposed to be in bed. She would take off her glasses and Jean forward, and then she would smile at herself. It was late August when Andrew and Papa went walking up to see the failed peanut crop. When they came back, we knew it was over, and Great-Aunt Millenium cooked a big special dinner in honor of Andrew and Lavinia Elizabeth. It was all very romantic. I did not even mind the chance drops of water slipping down my face from my curls, I was so interested in watching them. Lavinia Elizabeth smiled at Andrew and he smiled at her. I felt a lump in my throat when Lavinia Elizabeth would be so lovely just with smiling at Andrew. Papa smiled at Mama and Great-Aunt Millenium. "Well, we made a mistake or two," said Papa.
"Never mind," said Mama. Papa leaned back in his chair. "But nothing that can't be repaired by a good extra hired man next summer," he said. "Well, we'll certainly plow up the peanuts you planted half the country with," said Aunt Millenium drily, "and those sweet peas Maude filled my vegetable garden with." "Oh my," said Mama, laughing. "I did make a mistake there, but they were so pretty...." "Yes," said Aunt Millenium, "but as pretty as sweet peas are, I'm afraid the peas you can eat and put in cans are more sensible." Andrew laughed, but he was not looking at us. He looked only at Lavinia Elizabeth. Toby and I went outside after Great-Aunt Millenium's supper. Toby went to the garage and came out with a bucket and a flashlight. "What are you doing?" I asked him. I felt bad about the summer being nearly over. Two more days.... "Tm thinking about going fishing tomorrow. I'm thinking about trapping some night-crawlers." "Oh," I said. I watched him from the porch. In a few minutes Lavinia Elizabeth and Andrew crossed the lawn and leaned on the gate opening into the orchard. Andrew held her hand. "Look!" I whispered to Toby. "Abominably biological," he said, squinting with his nose very close to the ground. "Grand passion," I breathed fervently; then sadly I felt for one of my longer, slipping curls with my tongue.

ALPINE STAKE (UTAH), AMERICAN FORK SEVENTH WARD RELIEF SOCIETY RAG BEE, January 29, 1948 Sister Alice Carlisle, President, Alpine Stake Relief Society, has submitted an account from the American Fork Seventh Ward which well illustrates the zeal of Relief Society workers: "The room was a beehive of activity as thirty members assembled for a regular old-fashioned rag bee. First, a fashion show of the clothing that was to be cut or torn in strips for the rugs was held. Needless to say, there was a great deal of merriment. The coats of the women were safely hung on hangers on a rack so that none of them would meet the fate of the coat belonging to the lady from Lehi, who, when weaving rugs for her own ward, discovered that her own coat had been cut up into strips. In all, thirty-one balls of rags were sewed, as well as a large box of rags torn, which were later sewed by the sisters in their homes. In keeping with the occasion, homemade cinnamon rolls and grape juice were served as refreshments by Sister Froelick and Sister Wall.

NOTES FROM THE FIELD 551

OAKLAND STAKE (CALIFORNIA) VISITING TEACHERS CONVENTION February 27, 1948 Hilda E. Perkins, President, Oakland Stake Relief Society, reports a most interesting and inspiring visiting teachers convention: "A warm welcome and greeting was afforded the faithful sisters and a tribute of love paid to each, about one hundred being present. Each president of the seven wards in Oakland Stake, as her name was called, arose and stood while she reported the number of families in her ward, number of districts, number of visiting teachers enrolled and number present, the percentage of visits made in January. Several presidents reported 100% on visits made and others were close to this mark. A most entertaining program was given, with each ward participating. A question box, pertaining to the duties of the visiting teacher, was conducted by Sister Ruth Hilton and a trio was rendered by the young mothers of Oakland Ward. Mary Stewart and Inez McFarland presented a demonstration of visiting teaching, with families from Hayward, Elmhurst, and San Leandro Wards assisting. Fern Everett of Maxwell Park Ward and Lou Seiver of Alameda Ward gave talks on the preparation and responsibilities of visiting teachers. A social and refreshments followed the convention."
