Alta Jensen Vance Madeline P. Stevens Secretary-Treasurer, Big Cottonwood Stake Relief Society IN the Book of Mosiah in the Book of Mormon we read "that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God." This true principle has been adhered to since her early teens by Alta J. Vance who was appointed to the Relief Society general board on May 26, 1948. Born the daughter of Amanda Jane Clement and Ephraim Jensen, at Wales, Sanpete County, Utah, she comes of stalwart pioneer ancestry. Her mother passed away when she was twelve days old and she was reared by her father's sister in Fairview until she was six years of age. At this time, her father re-married and she returned to live with him and receive her education. Graduating from Moroni High School, she came to Salt Lake City to attend the Latter-day Saints Business College and continued her courses from the University of Utah. Sister Vance has given service in all of the auxiliary organizations of the Church. In the Relief Society, she was literature class leader in the Harvard Ward; social science leader of Mt. Olympus Ward, later serving as a stake board member in this capacity in Big Cottonwood Stake. As president of Mt. Olympus Ward Relief Society, she served from August 29, 1942, until her appointment as Relief Society stake president of Big Cottonwood Stake, March 18, 1945. ALTA JENSEN VANCE NEW BOARD MEMBERS

In 1939, Brother Vance left on a two-year mission to Canada and during his absence the responsibility of business and family fell to Sister Vance. She was very successful in both these undertakings. She is the mother of two fine sons, Roland and Byron, and a very gracious daughter, Loretta. Sister Vance has remarkable organizational ability, wisdom, caution, and a deep feeling of compassion and tolerance. In her humility and steadfastness, hers will be a service of love and joy in connection with her general board work.
