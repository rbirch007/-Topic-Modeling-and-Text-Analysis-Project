THESUMMER DAY Beatrice Knowlton Ekman

The summer day is languorous with heat,
And through my window near the gable eaves
There floats a fragrant incense, nectar-sweet,
From honeysuckle bloom and brier leaves.

The turquoise sky is mirrored in the pool,
And down the path beneath the elm-tree shade,
The overhanging boughs make dim and cool
The earth, where changing shadow prints are laid.

The bees are noisy in the linden tree,
A sparrow stalks a robin on the grass.
This peaceful quiet sets my spirit free,
And I could wish the day might never pass.
