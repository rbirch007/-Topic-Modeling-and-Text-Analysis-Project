Christine Hinckley Robinson
Rae B. Barker
Former Member, Relief Society General Board

PREPAREDNESS invites opportunity and responsibility. This is evidenced in the appointment of Christine Hinckley Robinson to membership on the general board of Relief Society, May 26, 1948. A daughter of Bryant S. Hinckley and Christine Johnson, she responded to the refining influence of the gospel as her parents and grandparents lived it in strength and beauty.

When a baby, Christine's mother died. With the close companionship of her sister Carol, she matured in an atmosphere of love and artistry in the home of her maternal grandparents, Brother and Sister Niels Johnson of Provo, Utah. The Provo schools, and eventually the Brigham Young University, launched her on an extensive scholastic program which was continued in New York after her marriage to O. Preston Robinson. It was at the B. Y. U. that the two met.

Since then they have achieved success and wide recognition together—she in interior decorating, he in marketing. CHRISTINE HINCKLEY ROBINSON

Sister Robinson was an instructor in the Foster School of Fine Arts in New York City. Together, they wrote the textbook Successful Retail Salesmanship. Teamwork stands out as their most enviable accomplishments, each complimenting and magnifying the other. Such co-operation will be a real asset in Christ's new Relief Society assignment.

Her Church activities have consistently paralleled her varied civic, academic, and creative work. With experience in all the Church auxiliaries, the emphasis has been in Relief Society. For fifteen years she served successfully as ward class leader, counselor, and in the presidency of the New York Stake Relief Society.

The three Robinson children, Miriam, Bruce Hinckley, and Christine Carol, find ample opportunity for individuality in the midst of their mother's artistic expression in home and garden.

Endowed with deep spiritual insight and keen creative intellect, Sister Robinson has developed increasing capacity for leadership. She genuinely loves people and loves life. She inspires faith because she relies on faith. She builds strength in others because she has strong convictions.

The vitality of her testimony of the gospel was recently demonstrated in a practical way. She and her family, after living for nearly twenty years in New York, chose to leave bright fields of success to make their home in Utah with the body of the Church.

As a member of the general board, Sister Robinson will be a power for good. Her inheritance, experience, and training eminently fit her for service in this great organization. She has, in a high degree, the fundamental requirements for effective Relief Society work—a love for, and sympathetic understanding of people, with an ardent desire to help. Artistic in temperament, clear in her thinking, warm-hearted and generous, she makes friends and promotes every cause in which she engages.
