REMEMBRANCE FOR FEBRUARY He was a plain man, with plain virtues—honesty, decision, tenacity, infinite sympathy. He died more tenderly lamented than any ruler in history, but the grief was not wholly for the way he died, but rather for the way he had lived, because of the courageous achievements of his fiftysix years of life. Someone once said, at the end of a walk in spring, "I have grown taller 101 from walking with the trees." So it may be reasoned that all Americans, and people of other lands as well, may grow taller by weaving into the intricate strands of their own lives the words and the wisdom and the high example of the lives of great men, until that time when universal peace shall "'lie like a shaft of light across the land." —V. P. C.
