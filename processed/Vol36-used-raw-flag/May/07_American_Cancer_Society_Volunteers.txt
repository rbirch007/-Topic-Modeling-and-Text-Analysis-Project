American Cancer Society Volunteers Bertha Hare Long, National Deputy Commander HEN I visited the national headquarters of the Relief Society of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, | was tremendously impressed with the program of volunteer service which is carried on from year to year by this group of consecrated women. I felt almost as if I were walking on holy ground when I walked through the large board meeting room and viewed the oil portraits of the women who had started and carried forward this service to humanity, as it is still being done. They were women of courage and vision and as each has handed the torch of leadership on to her followers, the same inspiration has been carried along, so that it touches the spirit of even a visitor such as I was. And so I said to myself, what can I tell these women of volunteer services? It is for me rather to learn from them. However, it is true that the Field Army of the American Cancer Society has a splendid record of service to humanity also, and for reasons of information, it is with pleasure that I set down a few of these accomplishments. The American Cancer Society was organized in 1913 by doctors and scientists, with a few laymen, who, motivated by the same unselfish spirit of the great doctors of our nation, wanted to make a concerted effort against the scourge of cancer. 'They began by surveys, pooling their knowledge, developing a program to increase medical facilities, and to further educate their profession in the nature of this disease. By 1936, they had a very good record of accomplishment, having developed facilities from about thirteen approved hospitals to over 300 approved hospitals and clinics. The great need now was to bring the public up-to-date on the knowledge and information which had been approved by the American Medical Association. 'There was no money for an educational program. The women of the nation were called upon to organize the Field Army for the purpose of educating the public. It was almost a hopeless task, for ignorance, superstition, and fear filled the minds of many people until few were even willing to listen to the program' of education or to read the available literature. The accomplishment of these women of courage, vision, and energy should be a matter of pride to all women. In ten years time, the attitude of the public toward the disease has changed greatly. Today magazines, newspapers, radio stations, etc., are co-operating to get the message to Mr. And Mrs. Average Citizen that "early cancer may be cured, through surgery, X-ray, radium;" to teach them the necessity of complete, periodic health examinations and to go to their family physician at once when any of the "seven danger signals" Page 305 This jg a notable feat in the field f Cati e that we SUN our work O tch that oy; Nation has ever known jg seekin Tecent SUIVEy Te the Causes of Cancer, new Means of veals that Only half of the Popula- 'A8NOsing jt, and additional] meth 10n of M€nca can 'Me a single o S of Curing it, Jy Is g Program early symptom of Cancer, that anyone May be proud to sup.
