THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE VOL. 36, NO. 7., — JULY 1949 Pioneer INlother Ruth H. Chadwick She held him close to nestle near her breast, And tried to hush each fitful baby moan; Tenderly, her aching arms caressed The thin, frail body, hot against her own. Into the blackened strangeness of the night, Beyond the covered wagons' friendly sphere, She gazed as lurking shadows grew in might To feed her soul's anxiety and fear. Her sleepless eyes then sought the stars above, And silent words made up her anguished prayer: "Oh, Father, spare this dear one that I love, And make me strong to carry my full share." She held him close, and from her stalwart soul Flowed living faith that blessed and made him whole. The Cover: "Pioneer Women at the Gate," Photograph by Willard Luce. Warren Lee UTAH STATE CAPITOL
