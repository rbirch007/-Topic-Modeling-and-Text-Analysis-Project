Her new assignment is a fitting climax to her activity in the auxilary organizations of the Church. She has served efficiently as secretary, class leader, and counselor in the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association, as a Sunday School teacher, a Religion Class stake board member, and a counselor in Primary, but her greatest achievement and joy have come in Relief Society service.

In this position, she has been a member of the executive council for the Latter-day Saint girls' program, which included for some time the NELLIE WARD NEAL preparation of the mothers and daughters meetings held in connection with stake quarterly conferences. She was Relief Society representative on the first Ogden Deseret Industries Committee, and vice chairman and later chairman of the Relief Society presidents department of the Northern Utah Region in welfare work. She performed faithfully and competently all the duties devolving upon her. A patriarchal blessing, given by her grandfather, James Ward, which promised that the spirit that led her Page 439 440 forefathers from the land of their nativity would be her constant companion in her labors, has had a powerful influence in her life. She was born in North Ogden, Weber County, Utah, a daughter of Lorenzo and Mary E. Barker Ward.

He and their nineteen-year-old twin children, Donald and Dorothy, have given wholehearted assistance to Sister Neal in all her Church work. She has always been interested in educational pursuits.

May our Heavenly Father grant you his choicest blessings in your new appointment." Little Sure Feet Iris W. Schow Through the long' days, over hillock and flat, Little feet measured the length of the Platte; "Stepped off" the rising slopes, through the coarse grass; Bruised by the jutting rocks, gained the South Pass; Over the steepest ways, pressed right along; Youth put wings to their tread; trust kept them strong. Now, tough steel tools, guided by a trained hand, Measure the breadth of our civilized land; But the survey which was real and complete Was made, step by step, with little sure feet. Biobege C. Cameron Johns Thoughts are worlds About to start, But words stay chiseled On the heart. Mood of Music Ruth Harwood Were I to sing to you today The music of my mood, The essence of my song would be A psalm of gratitude.
