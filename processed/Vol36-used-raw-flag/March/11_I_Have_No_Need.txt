I have no need for pictures to reveal the way You smile; your charm, the things you do and say.. I hold you close, so close against my heart— But sometimes I have need to speak your name I wait your coming when the hour grows late— And earth seems lonely as some distant star. I have no need for portraits of you, dear; I feel your presence; you are always near. I speak your name... And hear your answer, too, Remembering the long, long hours with you.
