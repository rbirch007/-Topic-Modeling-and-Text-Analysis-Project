Annual Urge Maryhale Woolsey Shine, window, shine! For the new sun to find you; Flutter, clean curtains! A May breeze is here. Sweep, broom, sweep! Leave no dust fleck behind you. Spring's the most heavenly time of the year! Polish and paint—oh, I love every feature That matches my indoors to outdoors delight, I am the happiest, luckiest creature— Having a snug little home to keep bright.... (Look at those robins, out there in the apple tree, Busy with feathers, straws, pieces of string; Over a last-year's nest chattering happily— Wouldn't you know?... Housecleaning for spring!)
