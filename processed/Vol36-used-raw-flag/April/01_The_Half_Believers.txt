the half-believers of his word, Who felt his power and yet denied the truth. We were the quibblers, pitting line and phrase Against the written law. We asked for proof. We were the faithless seekers for a sign To evidence his claim, yet were not fed Enough by testament of Cana's feast, The leper healed, the miracle of bread. We neither smote nor came to his defense, But watched him pass; his weighted footsteps made Slow imprint on Golgotha's path, while we Stood silently aloof and half-afraid. Some vowed that he had risen, had been seen. Still by relentless pride we were deceived; _ But when we looked into the empty tomb. Se: We envied those who had believed!
