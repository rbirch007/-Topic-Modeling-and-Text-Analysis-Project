A Song the Heart Must Sing Anna Prince Redd Love is a shimmering, mystic thing, A song the heart must hear and sing; As radiant as a wedding dress, As frail a thing as happiness. Oh, why did I not know! Gmpressions Elise B. Maness June is roses, June is laughter To remember ever after, All the myriad petal perfumes Gently blown. June is love the world expected; June is duties left neglected For the flower-laden sunshine, Summer-known, June is music faintly drifting, Sudden winging of birds lifting Above nodding clover blossoms, All spring's own.: R oses Christie Lund Coles Like frail tufts of marquisette, The fragile clouds drift in the sky; And beautiful, beneath the moon The roses lift their petals high, Their scent as gentle as the kiss Of lover on a loved one's cheek; Their beauty as ethereal as Pale sunlight on a mountain peak. Roses, summer, youth, and love Inseparable as stars and moon, Or love song whispered tenderly, As the lark's first ecstatic tune.
