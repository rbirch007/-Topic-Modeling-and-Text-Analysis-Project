Young Hearts Are Fragile Olive W. Burt HE superintendent of the Children's Aid Society was very kind. Martha felt that kindness spreading out from the calm gray eyes and the gentle mouth above the strong chin, spreading out and enveloping her like a bland ointment on her hurt heart. "T''m sorry, Mrs. Lewis," the quiet voice was saying. "I recognize your need and it is a very real and urgent one. But," she hesitated and then went on firmly, "please try to understand our position. Our concern is first of all for the children in our care. 'They need homes and love, yes; but they need more than just that. 'They need to live out their destinies—" Martha stared at the woman. What was she trying to say? What was the message behind her words? Was she intimating that she and Bill would not let the child live out his destiny? That was absurd. Why, they would do everything in their power to improve and enrich that destiny! They would give him everything Danny had had—Danny— The superintendent — glanced down at the filled out forms on her desk. "Your son was an only child, Mrs. Lewis. He was a wonderful boy—a shining, golden personality. And he died as he had lived, brilliantly —a hero." Martha felt the rent in her heart aching again as it always ached when Dan was mentioned. It was a tender ache, a proud ache, for Dan had been more than they said. He had well earned every tribute given him. But there was something lacking in the speaker's voice. She spoke of Dan calmly, honestly, but without that tinge of envy that crept involuntarily into most women's voices when they spoke of Martha's son. It was almost as if she didn't think that being a hero was so much. "You would find our little boys are not like your Dan. Not one of them, I think." Of course not! Martha thought. There is no one in the world like Dan. "But we'd do our best to make him—" Martha began, and was stopped by the coldness that froze the smile on the superintendent's lips. That is what we feared, Mrs. Lewis. You and Mr. Lewis have an ideal in your hearts — an ideal no child could equal in your estimation. We do not want to place these children in situations that will make for unhappiness for them— and for you, too; but, mainly, we are concerned with the children. No, I am afraid that, desperately as these children need the homes that have been denied them, we must reject your application." Martha could not believe the words. Reject their application! There was something wrong here. She stood up, angry, suspicious. "Is there something I have neglected," she asked cruelly, "a preliminary bonus?" Page 377 378 A faint flush rose with difficulty in the clear cheeks of the superintendent, who also rose. But her voice was still calm and quiet. "Yes," she said, "I am afraid there is something you have neglected, Mrs. Lewis, to put the child's need before your own." She gathered up the papers with a gesture that dismissed Martha, and, trembling with anger and hurt as if she had been slapped, Martha turned and hurried out of the room, down the dim hall, and into the street. Bill would hear about this. Bill would do something! Half-blinded by the sunlight, Martha stumbled actoss the street to the comforting green of a doll-sized park against the gray of pavement and buildings. She sat down on a bench, shaking with anger and disappointment, and watched the children playing around her, only half-seeing their bright, fluttering figures, only halfhearing their tinkling voices. It was going to be terrible, telling Bill this. She couldn't make him understand, because she didn't understand, herself, what was wrong. Maybe she would if she thought about it awhile. She hadn't understood about the little baby, either, at first. Probably her perception had been dulled by her sorrow, because before Dan's death she had been quick enough to catch and interpret innuendoes. T had been hard to persuade Bill that they should adopt a baby to take a tiny measure of the empty space left in their hearts with Dan's going. 'Their hearts had been so full when Dan was there—his sturdy masculinity demanding so much, his RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 ardent love of life filling them, completing them, spilling out of their hearts into affection for his playmates, his schoolmates, his buddies, his girl friends. There had been no emptiness then, At last, Bill, seeing her need, had said, "Of course, honey, if that's what you want. But a baby will be hard work—and you're not as young as you were when Dan was little. And I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed, too. But if you want to try it—" With no more encouragement than that, she had gone to the baby placement bureau and applied for a child. "We want a boy—a husky, blond, athletic type," she had stipulated, feeling that they would enjoy the child more if he resembled Danny. If Bill could teach him to fish and swim and play football and _baseball, he might forget, just a little, what he had lost. She had filled out the proper forms. She had been eager at the interviews. She had spoken freely of their hopes and plans and of what they would do for the baby. "We can give him everything he needs or wants," she had said, not boasting, but hoping to impress the authorities. "We have a lovely farm—we haven't gone there for two years, but the lease is soon up. We can take the baby there—give him a pony—our Danny loved his pony and was a wonderful rider—" The woman had asked once, "Would you consider a girl baby?" and Martha had hesitated. She, herself, would love a little girl, but Bill —it would be difficult enough for a boy to take Dan's place. How YOUNG HEARTS ARE FRAGILE could a girl fit in? She had managed to convey this to the matron, who seemed to understand. But in the end it hadn't mattered, for it turned out that there was a tule against giving tiny babies to couples as old as Martha and Bill. She had been surprised. Somehow, she had thought any agency would be glad to give a baby to them, who could do so much for it. Their own boy had been an example of their fitness as parents—Dan, gay, eager, well-adjusted, healthy. But after she thought about it awhile she could see that they were right. She had never thought of herself or Bill as old, but they were centainly not young—and it had been a long time since Dan had been a baby. Maybe they would find it difficult to cope with a lively little fellow. Martha's problem was to explain this to Bill in such a way as not to hurt him, in such a way as to leave the path open for some other solution. HEN the time came, she couldn't tell whether Bill was relieved or disappointed. 'There were so many things about Bill that she couldn't understand nowadays. They were in some ways so much closer together, so much more dependent upon each other for happiness and companionship. And yet there was an invisible wall between them—a wall of fearfulness lest one hurt the other. Then Bill had said carefully, "A little baby might not have been such a good idea after all. But perhaps we could get an older child. I understand there's some society that finds homes for older children." That had convinced her. Bill was counting on this, too, to ease 379 the hurt that grew more and more terrifying as the empty weeks went "She had looked up the society Bill had mentioned and had made application there. She had been excited when she returned home after the preliminary interview, when she had seen the children in their classrooms. "Oh, Bill! I'm sure this is better. We can see what they are like— we can find one that just suits us. They are so nice, the people in charge. They say it's important that the child suits us and that we suit the child. We'll find one that likes skiing and tennis. He can have Dan's room, and Dan's trophies and cups will give him an ideal to live up to." And then, after all, their application had been denied! Slowly, feeling every one of her forty years like a separate burden upon her, Martha rose from the bench and walked slowly home to the empty apartment, emptier now, since she had dreamed of it filled with blond and boisterous youth. When she told Bill that night after dinner about the agency he took it more calmly than she had hoped. He reached out for her hand as she stood before him, hurt and angry, and drew her down onto his lap, cuddling her, making a child of her in his utter need. "They're right, honey," he said huskily. "It wouldn't work out for us. For some folks, yes, but not for us. We've had the best—"' his voice faltered. After a moment he went on, "You can't tell what they're like —even a kid of six or seven. He might look like Dan—a little—but 380 what if he turned out to be stupid, or a coward? I'd hate having him around." Martha leaned against him, comforting him, but the shadowy wall between them was thick and impenetrable. And _ before them stretched long, empty, futile years of remembering. Bill set her from his knees and rose and began to walk restlessly about the room. Before long he said, as he said so frequently of late, "Tve got to get out for a few minutes. Do you want to go for a walk?" Weary as she was, she nodded silently, and they went down onto the street, quiet in the shadows and solitude of the night. They began to walk—to walk until they could return home, physically _ tired enough to sleep. URING these walks Martha felt nearer to Bill. Here they walked silently, with no pretense at gaiety or at casualness. 'The poplars whispered above their heads and from open windows scraps of music floated out. But they were alone and unobserved, even by each other. There was no conscious direction to their steps, and neither one knew just where they were, when a sudden noise recalled them from their world of shadows. They were approaching a square, official-looking building, with a lighted globe above the doorway. At the curb, opposite the door, a knot of men and boys were leaving cars, and it was the scuffling among these that had caught their attention. "What's happening, Bill?" Martha asked, trying to reidentify herself with the real world around her. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 Bill glanced up at the building and understood at once. "This is the police station," he said. "Looks as if some kids are being rounded up." "Kids?" she asked. She stared at the group moving across the sidewalk; at the officers, big and husky with guns at their hips, and at the boys, dragging back, hitching their bodies as far as they dared, their boldness brought to a sharp edge by the hone of fear. "Oh, Bill! What have they done?" Bill shrugged. "Stolen a car, maybe. Or snatched a purse. Or broken into a cigar store. No telling what a kid will do." Suddenly, right in front of them, one of the boys, the very smallest one in the group, gave a quick twitch to his shoulder, broke from the policeman's grasp, and darted past them down the street. The officer yelled and started in pursuit. Martha wanted to put out her foot and trip the officer. She wanted to, but she didn't. She just stood there, watching. And in a moment the officer came back, panting, dragging the boy with him. "BILL" Martha whispered, "can we go in? Can we find out what they've done and what will be done with them?" Bill looked at her. "It won't be fun,' he said. "They're probably a tough little gang. We'd better move on and let the law handle this." "Tm not going to interfere, but I've got to see, Bill. I couldn't sleep if I didn't." | They followed the group inside the station and to the booking YOUNG HEARTS ARE FRAGILE sergeant. Martha stood just inside the doorway, holding Bill's arm, her eyes searching for the little fellow who had almost got away. He stood with the others, but apart from them, a skinny, dirty little youngster in soiled levis and a ragged shirt. The belt around his middle was drawn tight, and Martha felt like crying at the tiny girth of leather, as if there were not much more than backbone to circle. His eyes were downcast, and Martha found herself wondering what the eyes would be like, and wishing the child would raise his lashes so she could see. As she watched, he did raise his eyes and looked towards her, and there was no miracle there. Their brown irises seemed opaque, so that Martha could not see into them at all, could not read what went on behind them. Instead of being disappointed with this, Martha felt sad, as if it were somehow her fault. She began to listen to what was being said in the room, and had no difficulty in discovering that this was a band of juvenile car plunderers for whom the police had been hunting a long time. One of the boys, a youngster of about fourteen, seemed to be the leader. The little fellow who had tried to get away wouldn't talk when they spoke to him, wouldn't give his name, so the leader spoke up for him. "He won't tell nobody his name," he said. "Call him Skinny. Skinny Jones will do." He shrugged. "He's kinda dumb, someways, but he's little and quick—" So they make use of him, Martha thought angrily. She turned to Bill. "What will be done with them?" 381 "They'll get hold of all the parents they can. Some of the boys will probably be taken out to the boys' home on South State. 'Tomorrow they'll investigate more thoroughly. Some will be sent to the State reformatory—" "But if that little fellow won't tell his name—" "They'll get it. Don't worry." | iene then Skinny raised his arm and wiped his nose with one long swipe of his ragged shirt sleeve, his brown eyes wide and hard and unwavering. The pitiful inadequacy and helplessness of that gesture caught Martha's heart and twisted it tight. "Let's get along," Bill said, but Martha stood still. "Wait, Bill. Wait." When the boys had been taken out of the room, Martha stepped up to the sergeant's desk. "What about a little fellow like that—Skinny?" she asked, absurdly anxious to know that things would be all right with him. The sergeant looked down at her and smiled. His eyes were gray and kind with little crow's feet to humor at the corners. "Don't worry about him, ladv. We'll take care of him." "But you don't even know his name—or his mother—" "It won't be hard to find. He'll talk before morning—they all do when they're caught for the first time, even when they're as tough as that kid." "Tough?" Tough enough to keep his eyes dry, but not his nose! "Look, lady," the sergeant said, "they're a tough gang, and he's tough or he wouldn't last ten min- 382 utes with them. His mother you ask about is probably tough, too. We have 'em every night—kids like this. During the war their dads went gallivanting off to big war plants and their mothers went out to grab off some of the big money that was floating around. The kids had to shift for themselves. And we knew that's the way it was, and hoped it would soon be over. "But now many of those dads don't want to come back and pick up their old jobs and old families again; and the mothers don't hanker after working at home for nothing. So they chase whatever moncy they can find, and the kids are still left to get along as best they can. They've had half a dozen years now to grow tough in, and believe me, lady, they can't be handled like the kids you're used to knowing. Surprisingly Bill spoke up. "Isn't there something that we could do, officer? Don't you parole these kids to reputable families?" The sergeant smiled. "] haven't seen many reputable families asking for them," he said. Then he nodded. "Yeah, that's the theory—but who wants to take in a kid like that? Listen, you folks don't know the score. Go home and forget it. Or if you can't forget it, if you really want to do something, come back tomorrow and talk to the captain." They went out into the street, Martha clinging to Bill's arm. "T don't want him to stay there a single night," she whispered, tears choking her. "And of course when his mother knows—" "The sergeant's right about her, probably," Bill said, and went on RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 thoughtfully, "but that kid isn't bad—yet. You know, I got in a jam like that once—" They walked along in silence, Martha waiting to hear, knowing that Bill had never told her this because, though it had been of tremendous importance to him at the time, there had never been a place for it in their life together. VEAH," he said at last, "I got m with a gang that stripped light fixtures from empty homes. They called my mother and she I wish you could have seen her. Some of the mothers came weeping and wringing their hands as if their kids were ruined for life. Some came down swearing at the cops as if their kids had done nothing at all, mother came down, calm and quiet "She talked to me, not the cops, and she made me do my own talk. Ing to them. I don't know how to explain the way I felt—ashamed of myself for what I'd done, but proud of my mother and proud to be man enough to own up and take my medicine. And I was determined I'd never get into a mess like that again," After a long time he said, "Skinny needs someone that knows how to handle a thing like that—I wonder if his mother does." Martha was unable to sleep, thinking of Skinny in a room full of tough boys; talking, as the sergeant had promised he would, because that ridiculous nose of his would not give him any peace with the tears crowding back of it, hurting his eyes and his throat. And she YOUNG HEARTS ARE FRAGILE knew that, beside her, Bill wasn't sleeping, either. She wasn't surprised then, when Bill said the next morning after breakfast, "Guess Ill drive down and see what happened to the kids. Want to go along?" Martha nodded. She had remembered in the night about the little baby and the boy that had been denied them. It was no use, and she wished now that she could keep this last disappointment from Bill. In those last weary hours before dawn, she had resigned herself to forget Skinny and all other small boys and to accept the dreariness of her empty heart. MARTHA was amazed at the sure and determined manner with which Bill approached the captain. When he mentioned the boys that had been brought in the night before, the captain nodded, looking at the report sheet before him. Most of those boys are old offenders," he said. "They will be committed to the State industrial school." "Not that little one—Skinny?" Martha breathed. "Well," the Captain frowned. "His mother was located and talked to. She isn't a fit person to have charge of him and she doesn't want to be bothered." "But there is a parole for adult criminals," Bill protested, "what about paroling the kid to us?" The captain looked at him. "You don't know what you're taking on, Mister," he said gruffly. "When his mother finds out that you're interested, she won't hear of adoption. She'll let you take him and then hope to get something out 383 of you through the kid, and as soon as he begins earning money, his mother will pop up and demand him back again. And it just means that you folks, with the best intentions in the world, will have your hearts broken." Martha looked at him. "Our hearts broken?" she asked softly. "Captain, it's the young whose hearts are fragile. Let us help! If we can only keep his heart from being destroyed—" It was a long time after that before they were finally seated in the car, actually on their way home, with Skinny tucked between: them on the wide front seat. Martha glanced carefully down at the shock of dirty, black hair. 'The brown eyes had not lost their opaqueness, their secretiveness, and they stared ahead, unquestioning, unanswering. The captain had explained that this custody was temporary. 'The case would have to come before the Juvenile Court, and then a licensed social agency would place the boy in a foster home—perhaps in Martha's home. As Martha watched him, Skinny lifted his arm and wiped his sleeve across his nose, not sniffling, not admitting weakness, but driven to that gesture by the forces that were relentless within him. Bill's hand left the wheel and reached for his handkerchief. Handing it casually to Skinny, he said, "Blow hard, Son!" Only then did Martha remember Dan. | Never another Dan, she thought. This is our new son. This is Skinny. And suddenly all in the car were at peace. El] Paso and the Latter-Day Saints Sadie Ollorton Clark President, Houston, Texas, Branch Relief Society T was in April 1910, that Porfirio | Diaz finally became alarmed over the brewing Mexican revolution. He threw the frail idealist, Francesco Madero, into the San Luis Potosi prison and thereby ended a third of a century of absolute dictatorship. Little did he realize that a forced American migration would follow this act, nor did the unsuspecting Latter-day Saint colonists know how soon they would have to flee from their homes, or which families would be responsible for a new stronghold of the Church —the yet unborn El Paso Ward. The location of the city of El Paso has much to do with it's colorful history. 'The first name, "Fl Paso del Norte," means the "northern pass." The Rio Grande River, at this point, flows through the cactus-covered mountains, creating the best natural passage from the north to south in many desert miles. It was equally important as a station in stage-coach days, and was the key point in a transcontinental railroad building race in 1881. In the sixteenth century the venturesome Franciscan friars, traveling from Mexico City to Santa Fe with the Spanish explorers on the dusty Camino Real would give thanks for the grateful shade of the cottonwoods growing on the banks of the river, and would rest at this oasis in the desert. 'Today, cross-country tourists find this modern city a natural breaking point in a journey east or west. Page 384 American historians tell us the first white visitor to this colorful land was Cabeza de Vaca, the only survivor of the shipwrecked Navarez expedition of 1527. He found his way to this area in 1536 and was welcomed by the Indians living there. He was never able to explain why one tribe after another looked upon him as their God, asking him to heal their sick and bless their food and their children. For the next three hundred years this territory was under Spanish and Mexican rule. As a result of the battle of San Jacinto in April 1836, it became part of the Republic of Texas. In 1846 Texas was annexed by the United States. Of interest to Latter-day Saint readers is the fact that Alexander Doniphan was the first man to bring the American flag to El Paso. This was in 1846, during the wat with Mexico. Doniphan was loved by the Missouri saints because he befriended them in the unhappy days when they were expelled from Jackson County. When he was ordered to execute the Prophet Joseph Smith he refused, and told his superior, "It is cold blooded murder. I will not obey your order. If you execute these men, I will hold you responsible before an earthly tribunal, so help me God." The chief settlement in those exciting days was on the south side of the river. El Paso was known as "Franklin," and was too small to be very well-known. The Mormon Courtesy, Chamber of Commerce, El Paso, Texas VIEW OF MAIN BUSINESS SECTION, EL PASO, TEXAS Page 385 386 Battalion crossed the desert a few miles north of the village, in 1846, on their journey to California. In 1876, Anthony W. Ivins, with a party going to Mexico, camped on the north bank of the river, and shot a deer on the spot which is now the center of the city. In 1897, the Church Authorities asked Isaac W. Pierce to go to Cuidad Juarez and open up a lumper yard for the benefit of the people living in the timber regions of Chihuahua. He was the first Latter-day Saint to live in this locality, and his residence was a home for all friends going to and coming from Mexico. The first Church services in that city were held in his own house. Isaac Pierce was truly a benefactor to hundreds of travelers who came to him for aid, and he kept up his good work as long as he lived. He died in 1906. His son, Arwell L. Pierce, carried on his father's business as well as his interest in the Church. In 1912 he moved from Cuidad Juarez. He was the first Latter-day Saint to make a permanent home in El Paso, and when he moved there the Church came with him. But: in 1912, the old order passed in Mexico. One of the first demands the revolutionists made was the evacuation of the Latter-day Saints who had sought refuge in their land. Because of the Edmunds law, which was passed in 1882, a small group of Church members felt that the only way 'they could keep their families together was to leave the United States and make Mexico their home. In the decade preceding the turn of the century, they migrated to this southRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 ern country. Though few of them gave up their American citizenship, they all had come to look upon Mexico as their homeland. Their buildings were permanent, their plans for the future were all to be fulfilled in Mexico. But suddenly, and without warning, orders were given to leave.. Villa and his bandits were moving in on the villages, and it was worth a man's life to stay and defend his property. The colonists had prospered in Mexico, and the homes they left behind were spacious and beautiful. 'They were denied time enough to salvage their portable possessions. Beautiful china, valuable silver, precious keepsakes and _heirlooms were all left to be confiscated or destroyed by the marauding outlaws. J. W. Wilson of El Paso tells that he was in bed with a broken back, in the village of Pearson, when word came that Villa was on top of the mountain near the little town. The Americans left, wasting no time. Mr. Wilson refused any offers of help. He crawled to the top story of the house and hid himself. 'Through an attic window he watched the bandit army as it marched through and ransacked the town, looting, robbing, and even killing several of the native — citizens, then riding on. When Mr. Wilson did leave Mexico, he came, as most of the refugees did, to Cuidad Juarez on the train. He says: The railroad was so badly torn up and so many revolutionists were on it, that I was just two weeks from the time I left my home until I crossed the bridge into FE] Paso at three in the morning. The Mexican soldiers searched me and took all the cash I had before they would let me come across. When I landed on the
