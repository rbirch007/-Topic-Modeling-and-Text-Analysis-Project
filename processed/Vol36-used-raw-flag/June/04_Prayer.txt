prayer, Sister Cowley implored the Lord that we might guard our tongues. Most of the trouble and unhappiness that come in our association together is because of our unguarded tongues, the unkind things we say. Our pioneer grandmothers had a code. They prayed: "Lord, keep us from pettiness. Help us to be big in thought and word and deed." And it might help us to remember this, that great minds discuss ideals, 366 average minds discuss events, small minds discuss people. I wish we would remember and teach our children that to find happiness we must seek it in a focus outside ourselves, the kindly visit to those im troubl those in distress rather than to seek my own comfort—that must be something that Jesus would have me do, and to speak words of underus today. On the way, because the selfish putsuit of our own plans will guide us away from his path. Look about you. Who are the neurotics among us? Not these sisters on the stand, not our Relief Society officers, Out auxiliary workers, not our bishopric, not out First Presidency. They are too busy serving others to feel sorry for themselves. And men are only great as they are kind, and the more kind the more Christ-like. And I am suré we have no finer example in all the world than our beloved Prophet of today who is with us this afternoon. He is known all over this world as a kindly man who loves the children of his Father in heaven. I do so want to tell a sweet little story about him, and I do not have his permission, put I do have his daughter Fdith's, so maybe President Smith can settle with her. Fdith went to pick him up at his office, on a winter night, and he put on his hat and said he was ready to go. And she said, "Where is yout overcoat?" He said, "I haven't any." RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 She said, "Papa, where is your new overcoat?" And he said, "Well, I went out at noon and I met a man on the street who was cold and shivering and did not have a coat and I gave him mine." So Edith wrapped a shawl around him and took him home, and I am sure she must have wrapped it around him with special tenderness that night, thankful for the great heart within her father. So we must let ourselves be touched by the spirit of the Master, that we may speak words of kindness and appreciation to those we meet in the common walks of life. The Master said, "Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God." And the peacemakers are those who, having love and sympathy for men, are always trying to get them to undereach other and to co-operate with their Heavenly Faon earth. There is such an opportunity to serve all about wus, and it is not always enough to do the little things we have to do. The real joy comes in doing the things we do not have to do. | No! Long ago I was riding on a bus down Ninth South. It was _ We got in the middle of a bus driver stopped the bus and got A MEASURING ROD FOR GROWTH out and helped him across, came back and got in and we went on. Not a word was said, but I am sure every heart on that bus was warmed because he did not have to do that httle thing, and I imagine dozens of motorists had whizzed by this blind man and probably thought, poor man, I hope he makes it, but the bus driver did something about it. President Smith has given a definite assignment to Relief Society to spiritualize the homes of the Latter-day Saints, but we must start with our own by teaching therein the gospel of Christ. And we all heard Brother Howard Driggs say here in our conference two years ago that the spirit of the gospel is caught, not taught. It is easy to admire the teachings of Jesus. It costs no effort and it satisfies our yearning for the ideal. It is likewise easy to discuss him and his principles. Day after day and week after week, in our Church organizations, we listen to the great truths of his teachings, but when we have to dig down to build upon the rock; when we try loving our enemies instead of getting even with them, how different we find it. Yet we know it is the doing of these things that is the final test of our character and is the measuring rod of our growth, and though we cannot do all the things that Jesus did we can have faith in him. Though we cannot perform the miracles he did, we can still grow more like him who went about doing good. _ As we study the precepts of our Savior, seeds of kindness and forgiveness are sown in our hearts. Then 367 let us act upon them that they may bring forth their fruit. Then we must ask ourselves if we have grown in love these past years, and as we go among our fellows may our lives silently and surely influence others until the whole earth is leavened. Not very long ago Brother Stoddard and I were coming home from San Francisco and it was necessary to drive all night, so I took the wheel for about a hundred miles while he rested, and I was amazed at the great system of beacon lights and warnings on our great desert, warnings to the aviators and the motorists. And I noticed something else as I drove along that night, and you notice the next time you are out, that all these metal markers along the side of the road and these curve signs, they are just dark, dull metal. They do not mean a thing until our light flashes on them, then immediately they send back their warning to us. Now our Heavenly Father has put his guideposts all along the way, the Word of Wisdom, the law of chastity, of forgiveness, of tolerance and service, but they will not mean anything to us unless our lights are on. So let us keep them shining brightly and grow each day more like him, and be sure our measuring rod is big and broad. May our testimony of Jesus be the kind of which he would approve, a testimony clearly spoken through our lives, and may his principles of living, his example of helping others to the more abundant life, become our own life purpose, I humbly pray.
