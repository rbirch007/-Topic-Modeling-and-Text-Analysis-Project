On Writing a Short Story Fay Tarlock Graduate, Pulitzer School of Journalism, Columbia University HERE are many reasons why writers who are eligible should enter the Relief Society short story contest. Three of you who enter' will receive prizes and an abiding satisfaction. A few of you will discover that you like to write, a rich reward in itself. But the greatest good, perhaps, is that each entrant will have sat down and persevered until she has written a finished product. Writing a short story is a contest in tenacity. Whoever writes one has won in the struggle. In addition to this the writer has also gained a keener appreciation for the art of short story writing. Once you decide to enter the contest, get busy on your story. The idea may come from an incident in your childhood, from some mannerism of a friend, a newspaper clipping, or something that happened down the street last week. Within yourself you have characters to people. A thousand and one stories. Find the incident that will kindle the spark of interest in one of your familiar characters, and you have the germ of a story. One successful writer advises that a beginning author write only of the stuff of his daydreams. We all have secret longings. Is there one so strong in you that you desire to bring it out and give it to a character in a story? If so, you will have a real emotional interest in the character. Another writer says that the underlying idea of your story must Page 374 be that of a widely known human experience, whether it be the general rule or the exception that is as true as the generality. What you are, your fundamental beliefs and principles, will guide your writing, even when you are least aware of it. Draw from your own resources. Success did not come to Kathryn Forbes until she wrote I Remember Mama. When you have chosen your story, make certain in your mind that your choice is right for The Relief Society Magazine. You may know the Magazine well enough not to need to review the stories published in the last dozen or so issues. If you don't, read the stories carefully. Remember you are writing for a widely scattered audience of women, bound by common ideals. Your story need not be didactic. Indeed it should not preach. Let your characters be the moral force that you wish to convey. A good way of beginning is to get the material down and break it up into a rough chart, then build up to a definite climax. Sometimes an outline helps. Who is character A? What is he going to do? What about characters B and C? What are their intentions? Now write your beginning. On page one you should reveal what the story is about. Think of your material in terms of happenings. Any stimulus that does not promise some kind of con- ON WRITING A SHORT STORY flict is not a good one. When you have found a good opening situation that promises conflict, you have the beginning of your story. Don't try to tell everything in the first few paragraphs. Use little flashbacks to give the who, what, when, where, and why. Begin your story as near the end as possible. Set your characters in the beginning and let them tell the story. Description is always a form of characterization and you have only a few words to use. Don't make the mistake of telling too much about your character. Let him show himself through his words and actions. For the moment, become the character you are trying to convey. Look him in the face until you know the texture of his skin, the set of his mouth. Use his gestures, listen to him talk. How does he walk? Even if you have to shout to yourself, be your character long enough to get the feel of him. Back to your story. Arouse the reader's curiosity in the first sentence, if possible. Every happening in your story should have a good premise. Don't forget that a common device is to have the actor fail at first. With each failure he finds himself more deeply involved. Every complication must be planted, subtly. Then comes the black moment, then a new situation that has already been planted, and presto, the end. RITE your story while it is still afire in your mind. If possible, write it all at one sitting. Revise the first time for deleting unnecessary parts and fitting the parts closer together. Don't worry if your 375 first version is twice too long. You can cut and polish. When you have the story in workable shape, the events interlapping, the characters consistent, begin revising for sentence structure. You can console yourself with the fact that the greatest stylists of the ages have agreed upon the difficulty of writing a good sentence. As you revise, remind yourself that you have. Only three thousand words, at best, to use. Try making five words do the work of ten. Watch the adjectives. 'Too many of them can ruin any story. After superfluous adjectives, come the omnipresent connectives and _ sentences loaded with clauses. At the same time you are revising for words, keep in mind the sound of your sentences and making clear your meaning. You may have your story written and yet have a whole page of necessary facts you must insert. In time, you will take an interest in writing for its own sake. Your writing will begin to have smoothness and even beauty. One of the best ways to detect flaws in reasoning and in diction is to read your story aloud—to a trusted person or to yourself alone. You will find sentences that would make you blush if you were to see them printed. Begin wnting your story several weeks, or longer, before the end of the contest and give yourself a cooling period. Let your manuscript rest for a few days, or a few weeks. 'Then take it up and work it over. Many of those troubling situations will resolve themselves. Most writers meditate long on their stories before they are set on paper. 'Think of your characters as 376 you go about your daily work. The right dialogue may come while you are washing the dishes. At all times keep small sheets of paper and pencil handy. Don't rely on your memory to give you the phrase you conjured in the dark. It has to be written down at the moment. Before you start to revise, surround yourself with writers' tools. A good dictionary comes first. With it, should be a number of books on word study. By all means have a handbook of good usage and perhaps a textbook of English grammar. Writers have nothing new to write; it is the saying of it that must be new. The tool books are used more by professionals than by amateurs. Ask yourself these questions: RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE—JUNE 1949 1. Does the reader know what my story is about? 2. Is its underlying theme timely and provocative? 3. Have I created a single impression? 4. Do my characters seem real? 5. Is there suspense? 6. Have I aroused worthy emotions? If you can answer yes, you have done a good piece of work. Reference Books Preparing the Manuscript, by Udia G. Olsen, $1.25. Story Writing, by Edith R. Mirnelees, — ene Fiction Writing, by D.
