Alien and Lost Dorothy J. Roberts Summer lingers longest In the fragile rose, For the frail are strongest And lovely to the close. In shrouds of gray November All summer's bloom but this Living, coral ember + Of a season's bliss. Poet Gertrude T. Koven I cannot paint the summer hills Against the wind-swept sky, Nor mock the song of whippoorwills, As evening time draws nigh; But I can take a few small words, And weave them close in time, Until, like music of the birds, They beat with joyous rhyme. Something of June's wild fragrance Scorns the scythe of frost, Cloaked in a pale bud's vagrance, Alien and lost.
