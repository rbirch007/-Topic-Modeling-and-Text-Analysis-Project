THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZIN VOL. 36, NO. 11 NOVEMBER 1949 cries on llovembep light a The Cover: Marvin Jones The gray geese fly with the wind tonight To the far, far edge of dawn— The marsh is alone and still and white Now their trumpeting song is gone, I am alone as the marsh, and stil] As the soundlessness of Tain, Beating my heart and November's hill With its monotone of pain. But the geese will return another day, Arrowed against the blue; Back to the hill and the marsh to stay Till their summeting song is through— While hill and marsh and the wild heart's tether Grow warm again in April weather. -.
