Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponents, February 1, and February 15, 1885 "For the Rights of the Women of Zion and the Rights of the Women of All Nations" Editorial: Marvelous Times Who can say that these are not marvelous times and big with wonderful events? Every day some startling development is made that makes one conscious of the fact that these are the times that try men's souls to the very centre. With all the accidents of the nineteenth century nothing is so effectually calculated to prove a destructive agency for the wicked and ungodly as the invention and manufacture of dynamite. What may not be accomplished by this terrible agent of destruction when manipulated by cruel, designing and unscrupulous men or women, though we instinctively shrink from the acknowledgement, yet women have been proven equally cruel with men when occasion required urgent action.... The recent explosion in London has opened the ey" of many who sat in darkness on this subject, and that was no doubt only an experiment, and ere long the nations will awaken to the consciousness of the astounding fact that when there was seeming security, they were treading upon dangerous ground that might at any moment explode and swallow them up. Secret societies, combinations and organizations are banding themselves together for certain purposes, and it would seem the time is fast approaching when every man's hand will be against his neighbor, and he who will not take up his sword must needs flee to Zion  Editorial Notes: Mrs. John T. Caine and Mrs. Franklin S. Richards attended the recent Convention of the National Woman's Suffrage Association in Washington. A very pleasant ladies' tea party was given at the Devereux House on Thursday, January 29, by Mrs. Priscilla Jennings, who is a most entertaining and hospitable hostess. There were between thirty and forty ladies present, most of them widows and missionaries' wives. The supper was very handsomely served, the table being very beautifully decorated with fragrant flowers. Mr. And Mrs. Jennings as host and hostess cannot be excelled. The afternoon and evening were spent by the ladies in social conversation, and every one seemed to intensely enjoy the visit. Devereux House is a beautiful modern mansion, and with its large and elegant parlors, commodious dining apartments, and handsome and complete library, conservatory and other luxuries, possesses all the advantages of a refined and luxurious home. We heartily wish its inmates long life and health to enjoy the blessings with which they are surrounded. Sister Eliza R. Snow Smith's birthday passed off very quietly. She received those who called to congratulate her in her parlor at the Lion House. The honored lady has now reached the advanced age of 81 years. Her health is excellent, her faculties unimpaired; indeed her memory seems as bright and perfect as ever, and her mind as clear and active as it ever has been; she still continues to write and works more hours in the day than most young people.... Correspondence: Snowville, Box Elder County, Utah, Editor Exponent  As I have never read anything in your valuable columns about Snowville (which I will state for explanation is named in honor of our beloved Apostle Lorenzo Snow, and not because we have any more snow than you do in Salt Lake City), I thought I would drop you a few lines concerning our ward. We are, the most of us, striving to be Latter-day Saints. Our Relief Society is in full force, with Sister Mary Goodliffe as Prest. They look after the poor in purse and spirit, and the sick also; they have lots of wheat on hand, in fact the Bishop says they are the richest people in the ward, and if you want anything done without fail, call on the Relief Society, and it is done.... Your paper is a welcome guest in our homes and we say long life to "Aunt Em" and her able staff and God bless you. Secretary. Page 86
