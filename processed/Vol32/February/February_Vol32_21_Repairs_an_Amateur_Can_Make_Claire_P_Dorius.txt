Repairs An Amateur Can Make Chile P. Don us "A hole is nothing at all, but you can break your neck in it."?Austin O'Malley 
NOW is the time to get your tool kit ready. You, no doubt, will have many occasions to use it before the repair man comes around again. Take an inventory of what you have, to see if you can find the following: hammer (two sizes), screwdriver, a pair of pliers, a three-cornered file, a cross-cut saw, folding rule, small can of machine oil, scissors, jack knife, awl, rubber force pump 'plumber's friend', nails, screws, tacks, scraper for removing old paint, pipe wrench, friction tape, auger, turpentine, putty, plastic wood and paint brushes in good condition. You may need additional tools, but the above list is a good beginning. Good tools are a good investment. They are now very scarce, so it pays to take good care of what you have.
Electrical Repairs?Caution. Remember that live wires are dangerous. Avoid handling electric cords, switches, etc., with wet hands. If you are repairing a wall outlet or switch, remove the fuse in the circuit.
What to do when your lights go out?It may mean a blown-out fuse which indicates there is something wrong with the electrical equipment or the manner in which it is used. The fuse is a safety valve for the electrical system. It consists of a link of soft metal which melts and opens the circuit when too much current passes through the wires. If it fails to operate, the wires in the walls would become overheated, char the insulation and possibly cause fire.
Fuses must never be tampered with. Keep all electrical equipment in good repair and avoid overloading the circuit.
How to replace a fuse. First, find the cause and remove it. The blown-out fuse will have a cracked or blackened "window." Disconnect the lamp or appliance responsible. Touching only the fuse, grasp it by the rim, unscrew it. Screw in a new one and close the switch. Never use pliers. If you are timid about handling fuses, pull the main switch, usually located near the fuse box. Buy only fuses which carry the laboratories' inspection label. Remember, the proper rating of a fuse is determined by the size of the wire to be protected. Keep an extra supply of fuses of the proper rating on hand at all times. Your power company will give you all the necessary information.
Faucets. The most common repair any home owner can make is to repair a leaking faucet. First disconnect the water supply. Grasp the faucet handle firmly in one hand, using the wrench in the other to unscrew the nut around the faucet. A piece of cloth or paper inserted between the nut and the wrench protects the faucet from bite-marks. When the faucet handle comes out, bring with it the defective washer, unloosen the screw at the center of the washer, using a screwdriver. If the screw should stick, apply a few drops of oil and give it a few taps. When replacing the new washer, buy one, turning the dull side toward the supply pipe. Replace the screw on the handle shaft and tighten nut. Composition washers may now be purchased which serve for both the hot and cold taps.
Sinks and Toilets. In order to repair the valves by which water enters and leaves the flush tanks of toilets, one needs to study the inside mechanism of the tank. It is very simple. Any plumbing supply house will be glad to show you. Any one can learn to use a "plumber's friend" or suction plunge. This handy tool is indispensable for clearing sluggish drains. The ball should be half submerged and worked up and down. Drains should be cared for when the first signs of clogging appear. Sometimes it is advisable to use a commercial flushing chemical. If so, always follow the direction on the can very carefully.
Leaky Pipes need a plumber. Temporary menders of pipes: putty, cement, friction tape or adhesive plaster wound round enough times usually stop the leak. These are only temporary measures, however, and will not last long. If the water pipe becomes frozen never apply a blow torch. The sudden heat may burst it. Apply cloths soaked in hot water. This method is slow but perfectly safe. Become familiar with the water system in your home so you will know how to turn the water off in case of an emergency. If a leak in the ceiling occurs, first, shut off the water supply; second, take an awl or ice pick and bore a hole through the ceiling where the water is dripping and relieve the plaster of the load above. This has saved many a large plastering bill.
Your gas pilot. If the pilot goes out close the main gas shut-off valve.
Try to do this with a piece of fine wire. The flame may be too small. If so, increase it by turning the adjusting screw to the left.
Sticking windows are unnecessary. Check the runways for signs of wear and lubricate by rubbing them with paraffin or candle grease. Secondly, examine the adjustable "stop" strips which hold the sash in place, they may need a little loosening. Third. If the house trim has been recently painted be sure to remove any paint that might have dried between the sash. If a door squeaks put a little machine oil on the top of the hinges. Swing the door back and forth in order to get the oil to run down the hinge pin. Repeat if necessary.
A broken table leg can be mended with a dowel pin glued into holes bored into each section of the break. In order to do this, holes will have to be made in each of the broken pieces. These holes should be less than one-third of the diameter of the leg and about one and one-half inches deep. The dowel should be as long as the holes. Sometime chair legs become loose. If the legs are bolted on, tightening the nuts may be all that's needed. If they are screwed on, the frame may be tight enough by driving the screws in farther with a screw driver or resetting them. Fill the holes with glue or plastic wood before resetting. If the rungs in a chair become loose, one of the best methods of repair is to use metal rung fasteners which are sold at hardware stores. These are inexpensive, hold firmly, and are simpler to use than glue. These fasteners are hammered into the rung and when the rung is replaced they lock in firmly.
