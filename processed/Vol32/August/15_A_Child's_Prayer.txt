A CHILD'S PRAYER Sue Hopkins Holy Father, hear my prayer, Lead me through this world of care. Let my sins be all forgiven. Find me safe at last in heaven. Annual Report?1944 Vera White Pohlman, General Secretary-Treasurer 1940-1945 
RELIEF Society activities were carried forward during 1944 very much as in 1943, and the outstanding accomplishments were in the same fields; namely (1) sewing service including an extensive assignment for the Church Welfare Plan; (2) continuation of special war services; (3) a further substantial increase insubscriptions; and (4) continuation of the Society's educational program with a slight but heartening increase in attendance despite wartime restrictions and conditions.
These and other services and activities were carried forward by Relief Society women with their characteristic devotion, efficiency, and humility, despite their intense anxiety over the absence of sons and daughters and other loved ones due to the exigencies of war, despite the increased demands on their own time because of labor shortages in their homes and communities, and despite the great grief of the loss of gallant young sons.
To all these, the sisterhood of Relief Society has been an anchor and a blessing, a source of sympathetic understanding and deep spiritual support, a means of easing anxiety and sorrow in the blessed-ness of serving others, of gaining uplift and hope for the future, and of strengthening their faith in the divine plan of eternal life and progression.
The growth in Relief Magazine subscriptions was reported in detail in the issue for May 1945, pages 292 to 313, indicating that the exceptional gains resulting from the special effort of 1943 were not only maintained but further increased during 1944 by nearly 5,000 additional subscriptions. Attention is also directed to "Notes From the Field" appearing monthly in the Magazine and recounting various Relief Society activities as reported by stakes, missions, and local Relief Societies. These continuing reports serve to high light and delineate Relief Society activities which, in an annual report, can be treated only in summary. Pertinent figures from the 1944 report are compared with those of 1943 in summary tables appearing on pages 494-495.
RELIEF SOCIETY SEWING SERVICE
Sewing service at Relief Society work meetings in 1944 was the most extensive yet reported, aggregating a total of 716,760 hours' service and 254,004 units completed. Classified according to kinds, the 254,004 completed articles consisted of 14,019 quilts, 21,866 pieces of other bedding, 39,725 articles of children's clothing, 18,578 articles of women's clothing, 12,195 pieces of men's
clothing, and 147,650 miscellaneous items such as dish towels, rugs, and other unclassified articles.
However, the number of women doing this increased sewing declined slightly from 1943 to 32,676. It therefore seems advisable to repeat the following exhortation from the 1944 Annual Report: "... this group of sewing women represents less than one-third of the total membership of the Society, and it would seem that a larger percentage might be brought into the sewing program, even though some of the members are unavailable for this service because of war work or other employment. Suggestions for emphasizing and extending the Society's sewing program throughout the Church, and for enlisting the interest and participation of more women in the work meeting through promotion of sewing skills, appear on pages 378-389, this issue [July 1944] of the Magazine."
Sewing for Red Cross
Approximately one-fourth of the women sewing at Relief Society work meetings during 1944 worked on articles for the Red Cross. These women, numbering 7,874, gave 193,338 hours and completed 103,744 articles. Although fewer hours of service were given, the articles completed were more than double the number reported in 1943, indicating the making of a greater number of small articles requiring less time than articles previously assigned by the Red Cross.
Sewing for Church Welfare
The next largest number of articles was completed for the Church Welfare Plan and totaled 83,414 pieces. This is more than three times the number of articles completed for the Church Welfare Plan in 1943, but in that year the assignment consisted principally of quilts, whereas the 1944 assignment consisted principally of clothing for men, women and children and supplementary bedding and household supplies such as sheets, pillowcases and dish towels. There is no segregated record of the amount of time spent at Relief Society meetings on Church Welfare sewing.
Many stakes held impressive displays of the sewing accomplished for the Church Welfare Plan during 1944. (See "Notes From the Field," June 1945.) As in 1943, the General Board authorized the purchase of materials for this assignment from funds of the Society, and disbursements for this purpose doubtless accounted largely for the increase of $4,268.19, or 30 per cent over 1943 disbursements. Permission to use Relief Society funds for this purpose was not continued beyond 1944, when collection of funds by Relief Society visiting teachers was discontinued and when the General Board and the General Church Welfare Committee agreed to rely on the provision of the Church Welfare Plan which charges regional or stake welfare committees with responsibility for financing assignments which they receive. The following comments from a few stakes reflect the spirit with which Relief Society women accepted this assignment and the pride which they took in its fulfillment: From Rexburg Stake (Idaho): This assignment was almost equally divided among the fifteen wards and at a special meeting was given to the ward presidents for acceptance. It was with a great deal of trepidation that the assignments were given to the wards, but not a single word of protest was made. Each president accepted her list and went home to work out ways and means of fulfilling it. Cotton goods of any kind and white materials especially were almost off the market, but this did not daunt the sisters. With a will that finds a way, the assignments were completed before the close of the year?many of them, before six months had passed. Some of the wards used their charity or their general funds, or part of both, for the purchase of materials. Others gathered donations from the teachers' districts. For example, a certain district would be assigned the twenty-one dish towels, and the teachers on that district would either collect the goods or their equivalent in money. Most of the layettes were gathered at a baby shower at one of the work meetings. At the meeting beforehand, slips of paper with the names of articles required were drawn by the sisters, and on the day of the shower, they came with the article nicely wrapped. The occasion was made into a lovely party, with refreshments, programs, and games, after which the layette was displayed by the presidency. One ward made most of their assignment from poultry feed bags, which they collected from the poultry men in their area, washed and bleached and then made into slips and panties, pillowcases and dish towels. Some of the bags were dyed in pastel colors and made into dainty slips for the children. When completed, the assignments were pressed and beautifully packed and turned into the welfare center. Not a single article from any ward was lacking. We feel that neither mere words nor cold figures can tell the sacrifice, loyalty and devotion which the sisters put into the achievement of this huge task. Many of them bought their limit or two sheets, giving them to the Society and doing without themselves. Hours of sewing in the homes were required for the completion of this project. But we are sure that every Relief Society woman in the stake is gratified with her accomplishment. From Phoenix Stake (Arizona): During January 1944, representatives from each ward met and cut all the articles for our welfare sewing; 50 hours of cutting was done. The articles were then distributed to the wards for sewing. Our 1944 assignments were completed early in the year. From Cottonwood Stake (Utah): The women of the eight wards met the requirements of the welfare assignment in the most co-operative spirit, finishing the entire assignment long before it was due. Great pride was taken in making the layettes, fine handwork making them very dainty and attractive. Every organization displayed in its oven ward the finished articles before sending them to the regional storehouse. From San Francisco Stake (California): The stake and ward Relief Societies exhibited their welfare sewing in the amusement hall at the October stake conference. This exhibit consisted of ten large tables laden with handmade quilts, clothing, et cetera. This display helped to stimulate interest in welfare work and an appreciation for the industry of the Relief Society women. The following comment from Uintah Stake is a reminder of the timeliness of the bedding project recommended by the Church Welfare Committee and the General Board of Relief Society in 1941 and 1942 for the purpose of encouraging and assisting families to restock their bedding supplies: From Uintah Stake (Utah): - During 1944 our bedding project was still being carried forward in some wards with interest and beneficial results. One ward with an enrollment of forty-one members ANNUAL REPORT 481 completed forty-three quilts, almost an average of four quilts for each work day of the year. At the close of this year we all know that materials for quilt making are practically off the market. The president of this ward tells us they are very thankful this bedding project was assigned for now every family in their ward is more adequately supplied with bedding than ever before, and in working out the project they have had very happy times together, have increased the average attendance at meetings, and have grown spiritually. Other wards have also done splendid work in the line of bedding. Sewing for Other Purposes Articles made for Relief Society purposes, usually to replenish the Societies treasuries through bazaars and custom sewing, chiefly quilting, also increased over 1943 and amounted to 54,434 articles. In addition, 116,171 articles were made for other purposes, such as sewing for hospitals and other worthy community purposes, but a slight decrease of nearly 7,000 articles was recorded in this section during the year, doubtless due to decreased need for this service from community agencies. Here are some additional comments which relate to other Relief Society sewing activities and to the efforts made to increase participation in Relief Society work meetings with a view to teaching and benefiting the members themselves with their home sewing as well as to give sewing service for others: From Uintah Stake (Utah): Also on work days we sponsored a project of made-over clothing. To make this more interesting and beneficial some of our ward leaders participated in a three-day school conducted by an extension specialist from the Agricultural College. These leaders then demonstrated in die different wards the work they had received, and soon many little girls were thrilled with a new skirt made from daddy's old coat, or a slip or even a dress made from his old shirt. To finish off this project we had a display of "made-overs" at our stake conference in November. From Rexburg Stake (Idaho): Our board added four women's and four men's suits to our baptismal clothing cupboard; also some towels and a heavy rug. This project has proved a great blessing to the children and adults who come to the Tabernacle for baptism. A member of the board is in attendance each month. A small fee is charged for the use of the clothing?enough to pay for the laundry. Our aim is to supply enough clothing someday to have every one wearing uniform outfits. From Phoenix Stake (Arizona): Thirty-two baptismal suits were cut and made and donated to the Arizona Temple. From Pasadena Stake (California): A project on which our Relief Societies are really putting forth some excellent effort is the remodeling of used clothing. We are obtaining old clothes which are in good condition and making the hard-to-get children's clothing, and the materials are far superior to any new ones which can be purchased at this time. From Ogden Stake (Utah): The wards seem much enthused over the new procedure on work day, and we are happy to note a general pickup, and that the attendance is improving. From Snowflake Stake (Arizona): Several bazaars were held during the year. One ward working for a new rug for their room put pep into their work by choosing sides. Each group was given $20 to buy material with; the bazaar netted them over $300. From Highland Stake (Utah): At a planning meeting on September 19, we presented a display of new and remodeled clothing and other articles in an effort to stimulate an interest among the ward workers in introducing similar activities into their work meetings. One of the wards held a successful apron sale and one helped with a ward fair. In several of the wards cooking demonstrations have been held on their work days. A fairly large amount of quilting has been done in most of the wards. We feel that the new work-day program has been carried out very successfully in our stake. OTHER CHURCH WELFARE SERVICE In addition to sewing at Relief Society meetings on articles to be turned in to bishops' storehouses, Relief Society women have done sewing at some of the storehouses, have assisted at storehouses with the canning of a tremendous amount of fruits and vegetables, and have stimulated interest and activity in their various communities in increased canning for home use in order to conserve food supplies and to relieve commercial supplies for war use. Although reports of the number of hours given by Relief Society women on Church Welfare projects (other than sewing at Relief Society meetings) are still incomplete, a total of 524,915 hours' service by Relief Society women on such projects was reported last year, almost double the number of hours reported the previous year, an increase of 237,105 hours, or eighty-two per cent. Only a small fraction (five per cent) of this service is given by women whose families are being aided by the bishops, ninety-five per cent of this service being given by women whose families were not being assisted. In fact, the hours' service by women whose families were receiving aid from the storehouses decreased during 1944 by twenty-five per cent while service by other Relief Society women increased ninety-six per cent. Of this storehouse service and other activities in the interest of the Church Welfare Plan, a few stakes and one mission reported as follows: From San Diego Stake (California): Our women have spent many hours at the canning plant as well as at the sewing center. A laundry room has been built very recently and the board, with the ward organizations, donated equal amounts earned from the sale of used clothing and equipped it with a fifty-gallon tank and laundry tubs. From the Canadian Mission (Canada): The sisters in several of our larger branches have assisted in canning about 2,000 cans of fruits and vegetables, and are at present working on welfare assignments?making quilts, layettes and maternity bundle" for use in their own organizations, and, of course, preparing more "Bundles for Britain." From Uintah Stake (Utah): In all wards, classes sponsored by Relief Society were held by the home demonstration agent for instruction in pressure cooking testing. Many cookers were tested during these demonstrations. Instructions were also given on drying of vegetables and fruits and sulphuring of fruits. Three classes of Relief Society women were also given instruction in home gardening. From Cottonwood Stake (Utah): Early in the summer all of the women possessing pressure cookers were given the opportunity to test them. ANNUAL REPORT 483 Although no accurate count was taken of the amount of canning done, we feel sure that enough fruits, vegetables, and meats have been canned to top any previous year. From North Idaho Falls Stake (Idaho): We have co-operated with the county home demonstrator of the Department of Agriculture in the testing of pressure cookers, meal preparation, growing of vegetable gardens, and demonstration in canning, bread making, use of patterns, et cetera. All these were done with the hope of making our Relief Society members more efficient in these war times. From Snowflake Stake (Arizona): Another activity that has interested our women resulted from our aim to get a first-class recipe for canning our most productive Arizona crop?pinto beans. The stake welfare launched the project throughout the Relief Society. The results brought sixteen samples of canned or bottled beans, from which first and second choices will be made. From Mount Ogden Stake (Utah): The canning for the storehouse was participated in by each ward as the season's produce came in. CONTINUED WAR SERVICES Relief Society women continued their wholehearted support of wartime agencies during 1944, as more extensively described in annual reports for 1942 and 1943, and in "Notes From the Field" for October and November 1943, and August, October, and November 1944. In addition to sewing for the Red Cross, already discussed, Relief Society women have served extensively at Red Cross sewing and bandage-rolling centers, but time spent for this purpose is not included in the count of hours devoted to Red Cross work at Relief Society meetings. The ward first-aid kits, first recommended by the General Board in 1942, were still being maintained by ward Relief Societies at the end of 1944, in the number of 780 kits, and, in addition, 529 home-nursing supply chests were being maintained; 544 wards were also keeping current lists of nurses available in the community as had been recommended by the General Board. The value of these kits to a community in case of accident or disaster was demonstrated March 14, 1945, when twelve men were badly burned in a Kenilworth mine explosion. This ward, in Carbon Stake (Utah) reported: "Of greatest value were the ten woolen quilts and the two woolen blankets. Most of the men, wearing nothing but charred bits of clothing, needed warm covering immediately. The bedding was lifted from the chest standing in the entrance way of the hospital, the quilts doubled and placed over the sufferers as they lay about waiting further medical aid. Later, several of the quilts protected the men in ambulances speeding to Price. Medical attendants expressed gratitude for the quick availability of these coverings whose warmth helped to stave off shock. Because a mine hospital is well stocked with emergency materials, other supplies were untouched. However, the nurse said, "Just one more man and everything would have been used," adding, "it is a lesson to all Relief Societies that there is a definite purpose in having these kits in every ward." A member of the Society remarked, "I thought after the war we might sell those quilts, but now I see their use extends beyond a wartime precaution." Narrative reports from some of the stakes refer to their war service as follows: From Phoenix Stake (Arizona): On the fourth Monday of each month our ward Relief Societies have taken turns serving at the U. S. O. They furnish and prepare the food. Sandwiches, cakes, pies, and homemade cookies seem to please the boys most. On Christmas day the Second Ward officers served over 400 boys. They felt a great satisfaction in making Christmas more pleasant for servicemen. From San Diego Stake (California): Our members have spent many hours at the Red Cross, donated blood, kept children that others might work, opened their homes to out-of-town servicemen, fed and cheered them, mothered them and sent them on their way wih a prayer in their hearts for their safe return. Our Latter-day Saint women are more than anxious to do all they can to assist the war effort. From South Los Angeles Stake (California): At the beginning of this year we were aware that our mothers were anxious to help, as an organization, the work of the Red Cross. We, therefore, arranged with our local chapter to become a separate unit, The Sea Gull Unit, and during the year our sisters have completed 1,216 articles of clothing and spent 3,990 hours working to help this splendid organization to help their boys and girls who are a part of our armed forces. From Mount Ogden Stake (Utah): The Red Cross has received extensive aid, as will be noted through reports. The canteen has received several hundred dozens of cookies, as well as many women giving service there. The surgical dressing department of Red Cross received many hours' assistance from Relief Society women. From South Ogden Stake (Utah): Six of our wards furnished 495 dozen cookies for the Red Cross canteen during the year. From North Idaho Falls Stake (Idaho): Our first counselor acted as chairman of the Red Cross activities. She arranged with the county Red Cross officials for regular working hours for the wards and nearly all of our Societies have helped to fill the county quotas. From Canadian Mission (Canada): We have sent about 300 pounds of clothing, soap, safety pins, et cetera, to the Relief Society in Britain for distribution there. We recently received a letter from the Relief Society officers of the British Mission, in which they tell us that some of our clothing has been sent on to France to help relieve conditions there. This was made possible through the help of one of our officers who, although he is in the battle area, finds time to do this work of mercy for the children who suffer there. Some of our branches have done exceptional work. A recent bundle came in from the Hamilton Branch in which were many children's sweaters made from ends of new material purchased from a knitwear factory by one of the employees who is an enthusiastic Relief Society worker. These ends were made into lovely sweaters, suits, garter waists, and even underclothes. It was a beautiful bundle. The letter from Britain tells of the need "over there" for children's clothing, ages one to fourteen, and clothing for elderly people, also bedding. We have promised to help as long as there is need. During 1944, stake and ward Relief Societies purchased additional war bonds in the amount of $37,889.46. Purchases for the two previous years amounted to $44,623.08 bringing the total by the end of 1944 to $82,492.54. During 1944, the General Board arranged for the pooling and safekeeping of these bonds, so that none would be lost track of during the reorganizations which will occur prior to maturity. By the end of 1944, bonds to the value of $41,335.00 had been deposited with the General Board. All stakes and war Relief Societies whose bonds are not so deposited are urged to take advantage of the free safekeeping service offered by the General Board.
MEETINGS AND ATTENDANCE
Relief Society meetings of all types during 1944 numbered 89,629, an increase of 7,317 or 9.58 per cent from the previous year. All types of stake and ward meetings shared in this increase but local meetings for members claimed sixty-four per cent of these additional gatherings. Further analysis indicates that 77.91 per cent of the increase in meetings for members occurred in mission branches which conducted 5,585 more meetings in 1944 than in 1943, whereas wards conducted 1,670 more meetings. These several meetings with extent of increase are listed in the table on page 494.
Training-Report Meetings and Ward Preparation Meetings
It is heartening to note that a slight increase of 3.42, or four per cent, also occurred in the number of visiting teachers' training meetings, and that an even more substantial increase was felt in number of ward preparation meetings which advanced from 7,018 in 1943 to 8,515 in 1944, an increase of 497 or 7.08 per cent. The increases in these two types of meetings were doubtless due to the emphasis placed on them by the General Board to help bulletins to officers, through the pages of the Magazine, and through the discussion meetings conducted by representatives of the General Board during the latter part of 1943 and 1944.
The combination of the training and the report meetings for visiting teachers (recommended in the Magazine for September 1944), and the stress laid on the purpose and importance of this meeting, doubtless stimulated this increase which it is hoped will be even more evident as the new plan is carried through 1945. The increase in the vitally important ward preparation meeting for officers and class leaders was further stimulated by a detailed outline of procedure which was published in the Magazine for September 1944. Nevertheless, the number of such ward preparation meetings should nearly double in order to represent a monthly meeting of this kind for all local Relief Societies during the eightmonth period, September through April, and during the summer period as required. In furthering these two types of meetings and also in held demonstrations during 1944 which were attended by local officers. Here is what three stakes have to say regarding the ward preparation meeting: From Phoenix Stake (Arizona): At the opening of the fall season each board member was assigned a certain ward to visit once a month (preferably ward preparation meeting) and to bring to the board problems and accomplishments of this particular ward. At the next board meeting these problems are discussed and any suggestions from the entire board are then taken back to the ward. We feel that follow-up visits by the same board member will result in more helpful suggestions. From Highland Stake (Utah): We have worked hard during the past year to get all of our wards to hold regular monthly preparation meetings, as we are fully convinced that such meetings present an opportunity to the ward workers to become more familiar with the Relief Society program, and with the problems and interests of their individual organizations. At the beginning of the 1944-45 season, we, as a stake presidency, visited the monthly preparation meetings of each ward to see how they were conducted and to attempt to stimulate more interest in such meetings. All of our wards realize the necessity of getting their officers and workers together in such meetings and they are now being held regularly. We feel that the visiting teachers' training report meeting and the method of making reports have been more successful and more interesting than the former procedure. From Uintah Stake (Utah): Another thing we think is resulting in good to our wards was a demonstration, at union meeting, of an executive officers' meeting, and of a ward preparation meeting. Ward Conferences An increase was also recorded in the number of annual ward Relief Society conferences held, but the Sunday evening meeting in March, also for the ward membership in general, may have been included erroneously in some instances. A substantial increase of twenty-one per cent was noted in the number of officers' meetings held in connection with the annual ward Relief Society conference, the number increasing from 1184 in 1943 to 1424 in 1944. South Ogden Stake(Utah) comments on these meetings as follows: We succeeded in holding preliminary officers' meetings before each of our ward Relief Society conference sessions. A questionnaire was presented by the visiting board member, at each preliminary meeting, checking on each department of ward work. In connection with the ward conferences, we wish to report that our stake presidency was very considerate of us, appointing high councilmen to attend both the preliminary officers' meeting and the general session in each of the wards, as well as furnishing transportation to the outlying wards. We feel deeply appreciative for this courtesy, and we know that it added much to the success of our conference to have one of the stake presidency or one of our high councilmen in each of our conferences." Increased Attendance of Members A small but encouraging increase in attendance at Relief Society meetings was noted during 1944. On the average, there were 475 more women in the weekly meetings than in 1943, bringing average attendance to 29,171, representing 28.6 per cent of Relief Society members. The downward trend of the two preceding years, directly due to war conditions, has been greatly slackened in some areas and entirely blocked in others. Nevertheless, efforts to improve attendance records should not be relaxed as ANNUAL REPORT attendance at local Relief Societies in stakes actually declined from 1943, whereas better attendance at local Relief Societies in missions accounted for the general increase. This is doubtless due in part to population shifts from home wards in stakes to temporary locations near war plants and military centers located within mission boundaries. War conditions, including employment of women, are still reflected in Relief Society attendance records. For example, Rexburg Stake (Idaho) reports: ? More and more of our women are working in the seed houses, stores, and in the fields. Snowflake Stake (Arizona) reported the following efforts to increase attendance: Three wards started nurseries during Relief Society to care for young children. Three wards had contests in attendance and preparation of lessons. One of these wards put their score card where the Sunday School children could read their mothers' records. Several wards made friendly visits to delinquent members, to encourage attendance. ' The accompanying table, when compared with similar figures for previous years, indicates some shift in the popularity of the subject matter treated at the weekly meetings. AVERAGE ATTENDANCE AT LOCAL RELIEF SOCIETY MEETINGS Theology and Work Meetings: Wards in Stakes 26,463, Mission Branches 5,325, All Relief Societies 31,518. Literature Meetings: Wards in Stakes 23,269, Mission Branches 4,030, All Relief Societies 28,199. Social Science Meetings: Wards in Stakes 23,509, Mission Branches 4,732, All Relief Societies 28,241. All Meetings: Wards in Stakes 23,692, Mission Branches 4,736, All Relief Societies 28,428. Wards in Stakes 24,233, Mission Branches 4,038, All Relief Societies 29,171. The theology meeting on the first Tuesday of the month continues to lead, with an average attendance of 31,818, but the figure is slightly less than the average of 32,187 for 1943. Attendance at all other types of meetings increased over 1943. The social science meeting day, on the fourth Tuesday of the month, held second place from the standpoint of average attendance in 1944, whereas it has previously held fourth place. Average attendance at the literature meetings on the third Tuesday of the month very closely approaches that of social science. Although attendance at the work meeting indicated that it held fourth place from the standpoint of popularity during 1944, attendance on this day actually increased over 1943 and will doubtless continue to do so as the modified program recommended by the General Board and published in the Magazine for July 1944, is further developed and varied to meet the home-making interests and to utilize the talents of Relief Society members. Average attendance was lower than in 1943 at all four types of meetings held in wards, but higher in each category in the missions.

Stake Meetings
All types of stake meetings showed increases (see table on page 494) except those held in lieu of union meetings which declined slightly, as would be expected in the face of a 64 per cent increase in number of actual union meetings held. It is also interesting to note that many stakes took advantage of the opportunity arranged for by the General Board to hold union meetings in connection with fourth-quarter stake conferences rather than to conduct an extra general session of such conferences. Although twenty-three more stakes participated in union conferences than during the preceding year, the number conducting extra general sessions declined by twenty-nine, whereas the number holding union meetings in lieu of such extra general sessions increased by fifty-two. ORGANIZATIONS AND MEMBERSHIP
The decline in Relief Society membership which has been in progress since the peak year of 1941 continued during 1944, but the rate of loss was much less than during the two preceding years. The net membership decrease from 1943 was 1,848 or 1.8 per cent, whereas the loss in 1943 was 3,373 or three per cent and in 1942 was 8,000 or seven per cent. The reasons for the decrease are the same as during the previous two years?unusual population shifts throughout the country occasioned by war employment and other war conditions, with the resulting lack of affiliation with the Relief Society in the new and often temporary location, and to the clearing from the rolls of names of women who joined the Society during the height of the membership campaign but proved to be not genuinely interested. Actually, there were more admittances to membership (12,730) during 1944 than in 1943 and also fewer removals and resignations, leaving the net number of members increased in 1944 at 102,961. Local Relief Societies should continue to solicit unenrolled women including new arrivals who in so far as may have been affiliated elsewhere.
The members are accounted for in a total of 2,217 local Relief Societies. The geographic distribution on page 493 shows the number of local Relief Societies and number of Relief Society members in each state of the United States and in other countries. These organizations and members are also listed according to whether they are located in stakes or in missions. There were 135 more ward Relief Societies in stakes in 1944 than in 1943, but nearly 2,000 fewer members. On the other hand, local Relief Societies in missions declined by twenty-four, but the number of members increased slightly (131). Another distribution of members?according to assignments in a Society?appears on page 494. As is usual, approximately half of the total membership is assigned to one or one or more capacities of the organization's elected officers, leaders, special workers or visiting teachers. ANNUAL REPORT 489 However, the number of stake officers and board members declined during 1944, doubtless as a result of curtailed activity on the part of stake workers due to war conditions. Executive and special workers in the wards increased slightly, as did the number of visiting teachers, but nearly 600 fewer class leaders were reported, as a result of the discontinuance of the home topic from the monthly work meeting, as announced in the Magazine for July 1944. Where there is a shortage of women for the various positions, one officer or class leader frequently serves in more than one capacity, but is counted only once in this distribution. From this same table it is noted that seventy per cent of all Relief Society members are Magazine subscribers? the highest proportion in the history of the Society. The percentage of subscribing officers and class leaders was about the same as in 1943, but sixty-seven per cent of the visiting teachers and other members was reported as subscribers in 1944 as compared with sixty per cent in 1943. VISITING TEACHING The continued decline in visiting teaching since the beginning of the war is again apparent from the 1944 report. Despite the fact that visiting teachers' districts were increased by 631 or four per cent, evidently in order to reduce the number of families per visiting teacher, the number of visiting teachers was increased by only 131, and the number of visits dropped by 46,368 or four per cent. Visits attempted where no one was found at home constituted 368,022 or thirty-two per cent of the total of 1,144, 519 visits made. Families were found at home in 776,497, or sixty-eight per cent of the visits attempted, a slightly better ratio than was found at home during the previous year's visits. Nevertheless, visits attempted in 1944 were actually fewer by 126,884 4% 4% 49444 immediately preceding the war. Although nearly 20,000 communications were reported by mail and telephone, in lieu of visits, contacts of this type were nearly 8,000 fewer than in 1943, or twenty-eight per cent less. This may be partly accounted for by the fact that the General Board discouraged the printing of visiting teachers' messages, some of which were doubtless mailed to unvisited families and were replaced by no other communication in lieu of a visit. The decline of nine per cent or 3,799 in average monthly number making contributions is a direct result of the change in policy, announced in the Magazine for September 1944, when collections by visiting teachers were discontinued, after being in effect for 102 years, from the Society's very first meeting. The new policy became effective in October 1944, so that the number of contributors shown in the annual report represents principally those making donations during the preceding nine months. COMPASSIONATE SERVICES Visits to the sick and homebound increased by seven per cent to 116,219 during 1944, but the number of days' care of the sick, both volunteer and paid from the Society's funds, declined by four per cent to 13,883. There was a decrease of twenty per cent in number of bodies prepared for burial, particularly with respect to those instances where complete preparation was given. This would indicate an increase in the services of morticians; on the other hand, there was a slight increase in the number of bodies dressed for burial by Relief Society women. It must be remembered, however, that many deeds of kindness, compassion, and helpfulness are performed for those in sorrow and distress which cannot be measured in terms of reports, as evidenced by the following excerpts: From South Los Angeles Stake (California): Every ward in our stake has performed its various activities cheerfully and efficiently, but there is one ward which we feel has had the spirit of service in rich abundance. The Maywood Ward sisters, under the direction of their president. Sister Irene Andrus, went in a group and painted and papered the entire house of one of their members who is confined to a wheel chair. From North Idaho Falls Stake (Idaho): The Sunshine Committee, which consists of stake board members, continued to make the weekly visits to the L. D. S. Hospital. We were especially desirous of visiting Relief Society women patients from distant towns, hoping to cheer them and to extend to them assistance when needed. From the New Zealand Mission: You will also notice under "Burial Assistance" there is a blank. This does not give a true picture of the situation as the Relief Society sisters are very active in their services for the dead. They have been complimented on many occasions by undertakers and hospital attendants because of the lovely manner in which they have dressed the dead. I have encouraged the sisters to see that elderly people and those whose health is failing keep on hand suitable white clothing for burial when the need arises. They have responded well to this request. Some of the Relief Societies are continuing to co-operate with local public health authorities in conducting well-baby clinics. September 1944 marked the twentieth anniversary of the Cottonwood Stake Maternity Hospital (Utah) which is operated by the Relief Society of that stake; 736 babies were born there during 1944. All together 8,595 patients have been admitted since the hospital was opened. This hospital is recognized as fulfilling all requirements of the U. S. Government for the acceptance of servicemen's wives. This stake has continuously operated a well-baby clinic since 1921. In 1944, a total of 387 children attended this clinic and all have the privilege of tree vaccination for smallpox and immunization for diphtheria and whooping cough, in addition to physical examination and consultation. Funds Expended Total disbursement of local, stake, and mission Relief Societies and the General Board during 1944 aggregated $539,155.22, an increase of ANNUAL REPORT 491 $98,552.90, or twenty-two percent over disbursements of 1943. Of this amount $110,354.57 was spent for charitable purposes and $428,800.65 for general operating expenses and the Society's educational work. The charitable disbursements represented an increase over 1943 of $18,168.69, or twenty per cent, which may be attributed chiefly to authorization by the General Board of the use of Relief Society funds for the purchase of materials for the 1944 Church Welfare clothing assignment. In addition. Relief Society funds were disbursed directly to needy families and health services were also provided in some areas. Commodities with an estimated value of $4,896.92 which had been contributed to the Relief Society were also distributed to the needy, bringing total charity disbursements to $115,251.49. Included in the disbursements for general purposes is a considerable but unidentified amount spent for improving Relief Society rooms and stake and ward buildings in general. The following few excerpts from narrative reports indicate the nature of these expenditures: From ???New Zealand Mission: Recently we have made a drive to raise money to install a community shower bath in one of the Maori Pas whose misfortune it is to be deprived of proper sanitary facilities. The response has been most gratifying. We have collected over $600 from the various Relief Society organizations for this purpose. From Uintah Stake (Utah): This year our stake board was asked, along with other organizations, to fix up the Relief Society room at the stake office. To do this we needed some money. So we accepted an invitation to prepare and serve three banquets for different groups and felt well paid for our effort when we cleared almost $500. From North Idaho Falls Stake (Idaho): During the early part of the year the stake and ward Relief Society organizations purchased a carpet for the Relief Society room in the stake tabernacle. Funds were raised by special effort with that thought in mind, in most cases. The stake board had in 1942 raised funds to enable it to attend the centennial services in Salt Lake City. Since that event was cancelled we decided to use the money in the furnishing of that room. From Nampa Stake (Idaho): On March 10, our board held a bazaar. Although only ten in number at that time, we worked hard and intensely and with help from other Church members we were very successful. Our profits were $120.15. We are working for a bazaar again this year in March. Our stake is looking forward to a stake building and we hope to have funds on hand for furnishings for our room. From San Diego Stake (California): In August 1944, the board was assigned the task of raising $1,000 for the stake building fund and we immediately went into action. We held an apron bazaar, a candy and ice cream sale, and gave a chili supper. A dinner was given later on and the balance of the fund was donated by our members. In a short time we had our quota with $55 over and were the first organization in the stake to complete this assignment. Total net assets of the Society as of the end of 1944, including cash on hand, wheat trust funds, war bonds, and other invested funds, value of real estate, buildings, furniture, and other property were reported to be $1,440,070.55.

Figures for countries in Continental Europe are for 1938, the latest available. Not to the Swift [Continued horn page 464) indians skulking in the ravine, had seen them slip down over the hill. The scouts had hopelessly watched them ride off, the old chief with Elsa's tablecloth and scalped locks streaming out behind. The men averted embarrassed eyes when she had displayed her bristling mop and intact scalp, but-the women had run, laughing, for strips of cherished velvets and silk to bind up the unsightly fringe. "Aye; it's tooken a brae' bit o' corage oon the lassie's paert t' gi' awa heer bonny tresses," old Jenny McBride had chided them. "If the auld hathen's kaipin his word we'll be slaipen' in hooses whin the cauld wind blaus." The old heathen had kept his word. At sunset on the second day he tore into camp, his braves tailing out behind, loaded with buffalo beef. After two days of cooking and feasting, of drying and salting down, meat, they had resumed their journey. Elsa would never forget the afternoon she looked down upon Zion. A cluster of log cabins nestled in a broad valley, turning to gold in the September sunshine. Two years slipped by. The hollows in Jim's cheeks disappeared. Firm flesh upholstered his gaunt frame. He fenced a piece of land, built a log house, made tables and chairs and a bed. He hired out and earned a wagon, two black oxen and the necessary tools and seed. One day when wild currants flamed in the canyons and choke-cherries fringed the waterways with "summer-snow," she gave Jim a son. Her heart had been too small to hold its burden of joy. She had gone, thankfully, to the Bowery on the first Sunday morning and sat with her baby across her knees. She had lifted her voice again in praise, had listened to Brother Brigham, secure in her dreams. It had all seemed so right, so wonderful to be in the Valley. Then had dawned the unforgettable day that brought her dreams crashing down. Brother Brigham was speaking. His voice seemed to drift in from another world. "The climate?suitable to cotton ?a mill site by adequate water power. Need men?skilled in growing of cotton?spinners?weavers?families who have proved their courage." Then, like a thunderbolt, Jim's name and hers! She had sat like one condemned, her cooing baby unnoticed in her lap. Jim came, his eyes aglow with a new purpose. Friends crowded around, some of them already bargaining their farms away. It seemed like sacrilege to her. She helped Jim pack as the weeks wore away and the harvesting began. Its abundance had furnished her scant pleasure. It mattered little whether she lived or died. She was leaving the mountains, going to a land she detested, a wilderness beyond the last outpost of civilization. When, at last, they joined the caravan at the "Square" on that early autumn morning, she climbed up on the wagon seat, hoping against hope that something would happen to turn them back. Men bustled about the wagons NOT TO THE SWIFT 497 packing and repacking. Oxen chewed their cuds and switched their tails with melancholy indifference. Women gathered in excited knots, restraining heedless little feet from the bedlam of activity. She sat on the high wagon seat, alone, staring at the mountains with desperate eyes. At last the command to start rang out like a pistol shot. A murmur swelled to a roar. Neckyokes creaked, oxen heaved and strained as reluctant wheels rolled into line. On and on they rumbled?past Ka-nosh, beyond Parowan and the Cove, up to Cedar Mountain and the Iron mines, over the Rim of the Basin and down, braking the wheels with logs of cedar and pine. SHE came to herself with a start. Jim was shaking her gently. She awoke into stark reality. "We're most theyah, honey," Jim reassured her. "But you'uns 'ill have to climb down while we take the wagon apart and lowah the pieces oveh the ledges with ropes." She lowered the yawning baby into his father's arms. "Walk about whilst I unpack, honey," he urged, setting her on her feet. She found a winding trail, worn smooth by the tread of moccasined feet. It led up to a lonely knoll, fluted and carved by age-long sculpturing of wind and rain. It formed a natural lookout, commanding the sweep of a country so vast one could only guess at its magnitude. Far to the south the hazy peaks of the Parashaunts melted into the misty sky. They seemed unfriendly and remote. Even the ridges to the west, like a giant steamboat plowing through clouds of foam, seemed but a shattered pile of rocks discarded by indifferent hands. Below, yawned the barren wastes of the desert cut through by the crimson flood of the river. She turned, hopelessly, to the north and?there was her mountain, rising above the crimson knolls in solitary splendor, girdled with pines that marched to its snowy crest, dimpled with little valleys that awakened memories of the almost forgotten homeland. Hot tears sprang to her eyes. All the old fears and bitter prejudices dropped away like a discarded garment. A healing peace enveloped her. The wind, pungent with sage and mesquite, swept up from the valley floor, singing through the fluted towers and pinnacles, calling to her, begging her to listen to the voice of the desert. "We are the everlasting hills, broken and sifted for your coming, O you strong ones!" they whispered. "We have grown hungry for the plowshare, thirsty for the harnessed waters of yonder river. Only the strong and fearless can subdue us. From our loins the fig tree and the vine shall spring, the pomegranate redden. Endure to the end, you faithful, that your children and your children's children may reap the harvest of your vision." She heard as only those who strive to love the desert can hear and understand. She began to hum in unison with the hidden chorus, and as she sang its message clarified within her heart. She saw Jim climbing up over the ledges to find her, the old proud look rekindling in his eyes as she ran down the trail toward him. LESSON DEPARTMENT Theology Church History Lesson 10?Brigham Young's Call to Leadership Dr. H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, November 6, 1945 Objective: To show the power of leadership under God. A N erect, broad-shouldered man in the vigor of his early forties stood one August afternoon in the year 1844 to address a multitude of saints. There were pain and anxiety in the faces that looked up at him, and a silence known only when the great moments of life hush human hearts. He began: Attention all! This congregation makes me think of the days of King Benjamin, the multitude being so great that all could not hear. I request the brethren not to have any feelings for being convened this afternoon, for it is necessary; we want you all to be still and give attention that all may hear. Let none complain because of the situation of the congregation, we will do the best we can (D. H. C., Vol. VII, page 252). Rows upon rows of men bearing the Priesthood of God appeared in order according to their various quorums. As of one mind they listened. Here was a man, a courageous leader, who had cut short his recent missionary assignment to the East to hasten home. His friends Page 498 needed him, for they, too, had heavy hearts like his. "Brother Joseph," their Prophet, lay dead, his voice was stilled, his sight taken. He had been their voice and their sight these many years. Who now was to hear the voice of the Lord and speak? Martyred while yet in his thirties, how could the people of this modern seer be expected to think so soon of the days when another would be appointed to lead the Church? That time had now come with shocking reality, and, within the hours of the day before them, there was a decision to be made. Would the Church be lead by a "guardian" or a president? It was Brigham Young who now stood before the assemblage to help the saints in their hour of decision. There was a firmness in his voice and a strength in his delivery which was so needed at this hour. Sidney Rigdon, who had spoken at the morning session of this August 8th conference, seemed too sure of his position as the rightful "guardian to build the church unto Joseph," LESSON DEPARTMENT 499 as he put it, to satisfy the hunger in the hearts of the saints. Yet Rigdon was a counselor to Joseph and had been with the Prophet during many of the most marvelous manifestations of the early years of the Church. Surely his claim to leadership could not be overlooked. But somehow the people felt the need of the voice that could speak the mind and will of the Lord on this most significant point, and Brother Rigdon had lost most of that sweet spirit so present among those in perfect fellowship. He had, because of his self interests, left Nauvoo for Pittsburgh sometime before the martyrdom of the Prophet (Doc. And Gov. 124:108-9). The saints could not but feel that his return now at this most critical hour of the Church had something of the opportunist element in it. In the afternoon of August 7 at 4 P. M., the day before the open-air gathering above described, there was held a meeting of the Church authorities at Nauvoo. A majority of the Quorum of the Twelve was present, together with the high council, the high priests, and the seventies. President William Marks of the Nauvoo Stake prayed, and President Brigham Young called upon Sidney Rigdon to speak, who said: The object of my mission is to visit the saints and offer myself to them as a guardian, I had a vision at Pittsburgh, June 27th. This was presented to my mind not as an open vision, but rather a continuation of the vision mentioned in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants. It was shown to me that this Church must be built up to Joseph,... And I must come to Nauvoo and see that the Church is governed in a proper manner. Joseph sustains the same relationship to this Church as he has always 'done. No man can be the successor of Joseph. The kingdom is to be built up to Jesus Christ through Joseph; there must be revelation still. The martyred Prophet is still the head of this Church; every quorum should stand as you stood in your washings and consecrations. I have been consecrated a spokesman to Joseph, and I was commanded to speak for him. The Church is not disorganized though our head is gone. We may have a diversity of feelings on this matter. I have been called to be a spokesman unto Joseph, and I want to build up the Church unto him; and if the people want me to sustain this place, I want it upon the principle that every individual shall acknowledge it for himself. I propose to be a guardian to the people; in this I have discharged my duty and done what God has commanded me, and the people can please themselves whether they accept me or not (D. H. C. Vol. VII, pp. 229-230). At the conclusion of Brother Rigdon's remarks. President Brigham Young rose to his feet and said: I do not care who leads the Church, even though it were Ann Lee; but one thing I must know, and that is what God says about it. I have the keys and the means of obtaining the mind of God on the subject. I know there are those in our midst who will seek the lives of the Twelve as they did the lives of Joseph and Hyrum. We shall ordain others and give the fulness of the priesthood, so that if we are killed the fulness of the priesthood may remain. Joseph conferred upon our heads all the keys and powers belonging to the Apostleship which he himself held before he was taken away, and no man or set of men can get between Joseph and the Twelve in this world or in the world to come. How often has Joseph said to the Twelve, "I have laid the foundation and you must build thereon, for upon your shoulders the kingdom rests." The Twelve, as a quorum, will not be permitted to tarry here long; they will go abroad and bear off the kingdom to the nations of the earth, and baptize the people faster than mobs can kill them off. I would like, were it my privilege, to take my valise and travel and preach till we had a people gathered who would be true. My private feelings would be to let the affairs of men and women alone, only go and preach and baptize them into the kingdom of God; yet, whatever duty God places upon me, in his strength I intend to fulfill it. I want to see this people, with the various quorums of the priesthood, assembled together in special conference on Thursday next at 10 a.m. (Ibid. page 230). A comparison of these two speeches strikingly shows the difference between leadership subservient to the will of the Lord and that prompted by the power of pride and self-esteem. The Savior pointed the way when he said, "... Not my will, but thine, be done" (Luke 22:42); "... Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister" (Matt. 20:26). God blesses the leader and increases his powers of leadership if he will but be humble and seek instructions from the mind of the Lord. As if having accepted the spirit of Brigham Young on this day, the Lord miraculously manifested his will concerning this man who was to follow in the footsteps of Joseph. Before the assembled saints, that August afternoon, President Young spoke. The spirit of inspiration was his: Heretofore you have had a Prophet as the mouth of the Lord to speak to you, but he has sealed his testimony with his blood, and now, for the first time, are you called to walk by faith, not by sight.... I now wish to speak of the organization of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. If the Church is organized, and you want to know how it is organized, I will tell you. I know your feelings?do you want me to tell your feelings...? The Twelve are appointed by the finger of God. Here is Brigham, have his knees ever faltered? Have his lips ever quivered? Here is Heber and the rest of the Twelve, an independent body who have the keys of the priesthood?the keys of the kingdom of God to deliver to all the world: this is true, so help me God. They stand next to Joseph, and are as the First Presidency of the Church. (See Doc. And Gov. 107:23-24.) I do not know whether my enemies will take my life or not, and I do not care, for I want to be with the man I love. You cannot fill the office of a prophet, seer and revelator: God must do this. You are like children without a father and sheep without a shepherd. You must not appoint any man at our head; if you should, the Twelve must ordain him. You cannot appoint a man at our head; but if you do want any other man or men to lead you, take them and we will go our way to build up the kingdom in all the world. I know who are Joseph's friends, and who are his enemies. I know where the keys of the kingdom are, and where they will eternally be. You cannot call a man to be a prophet; you cannot take Elder Rigdon and place him above the Twelve; if so, he must be ordained by them.... Brother Joseph, the Prophet, has laid the foundation for a great work, and we will build upon it; you have never seen the quorums built one upon another. There is an almighty foundation laid, and we can build a kingdom such as there never was in the world: we can build a kingdom faster than satan can kill the saints off.... I will ask, who has stood next to Joseph and Hyrum? I have, and I will stand next to him. We have a head, and that head is the Apostleship, the spirit and power of Joseph, and we can now begin to see the necessity of that Apostleship (Ibid. pp. 232-235). It was during this inspiring speech that the transfiguration of Brigham Young occurred. The late President George Q. Cannon wrote of this event: If Joseph had arisen from the dead and again spoken in their hearing, the effect could not have been more startling than LESSON DEPARTMENT 501 it was to many present at that meeting; it was the voice of Joseph himself; and not only was it the voice of Joseph which was heard, but it seemed in the eyes of the people as if it were the very person of Joseph which stood before them. A more wonderful and miraculous event than was wrought that day in the presence of that congregation we never heard of. The Lord gave his people a testimony that left no room for doubt as to who was the man chosen to lead them. In the Journal of Elder William C. Staines of the date of August 8, 1844, AXA following statement is recorded: "Brigham Young said: 'I will tell you who your leaders or guardians will be?the Twelve?I at their head.' This was with the voice like the voice of the Prophet Joseph. I thought it was he, and so did thousands who heard it. This was very satisfactory to the people, and a vote was taken to sustain the Twelve in their office, which with a few dissenting voices, was passed." Wilford Woodruff described the event as follows: "If I had not seen him with my own eyes, there is no one that could have convinced me that it was not Joseph Smith, and anyone can testify to this who was acquainted with these two men" (Deseret Evening News, March 12, 1892). At the conclusion of President Young's remarks, Amasa Lyman, W. W. Phelps, and Parley P. Pratt spoke; then a vote was taken on the question as to whether the saints should have a "guardian" as a leader or the Twelve as the head who rightfully stood in line of authority next to the First Presidency. The hands raised showed a universal vote for the Twelve. In this manner the apostles, who were the rightful authorities according to the revelations of the Lord, were sustained by the vote of the people and by common consent, as the Lord had commanded that all things should be done. The matter of succession was' properly and rightfully decided, and was now binding on the members of the Church (Joseph Fielding Smith, Essentials in Church History, page Sidney Rigdon and William Marks were hurt by the action taken that day, and later found themselves outside the favor of the Church. Rigdon returned to Pittsburgh, Marks drifted away to Beaver Island in Lake Michigan where he joined the followers of James J. Strang. Both men were excommunicated. Brigham Young, having met the qualifications of leadership, was to go forward with the saints. Under the power of his office and endowed with wisdom from on high this great leader was to raise "up an ensign on the mountains" (Isa. 18:3) unto which all nations were to flow. Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggested readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, read the question; second, read the assigned part of the Doctrine and Covenants to discover wherein we must "give heed unto his word" which has been written especially for us in this day. 1. Who took the presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ in the meridian of time after the Savior left the earth? Read Doc. And Cov. Commentary, pages 307-308. 2. How long in advance of the death of the Prophet Joseph did the Lord give word as to how the Church leadership would be carried on? Read Doc. And Cov. 43:1-7; also page 819 Doc. And Cov. Commentary. Doc. And Cov. 90:4; 107:24; 103:15-18. 3. What do you know as to the character of Brigham Young? Read Doc. And Cov. 126, also pages 983-984 Doc. And Cov. Commentary. 4. Compare the words of Brigham Young and Sidney Rigdon found in this lesson from the point of view of leadership under God. Visiting Teachers' Messages sources of Strength?Charity Lesson 2?"Charity Suffereth Long and Is Kind" Dr. Lowell L. Bennion For Tuesday, November 6, 1945 Objective: To inspire patience and kindness in our human relations. THE most beautiful story of and is ?charity that suffereth long and is kind" to be found in all literature we believe, is Jesus' "Parable of the Prodigal Son."
Imagine the father's suffering when his younger son said to him (after he had worked and saved all his days for his children), "Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me." The father may well have guessed how his younger son would waste "his substance in riotous living." When the boy "came to himself" and started home, penitent, his father saw him "when he was yet a great way off." Seeing him, he had every right to rebuke him, to remind him of his folly and sins, to crush him in his shame, but instead he "had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him." But let us not forget either that to his older son he said, "All that I have is thine." While the younger came back repentant, he did not share again.
Why was the father so long-suffering and kind? Because he was thinking not of his own wounded self but of the lad's life. The only thing that mattered now was that his son had come "to himself"? that "this my son was dead, and alive again; he was lost, and is found" (Luke 15:11-32). There is no more effective way to express charity than in kindness. Many people have no need of material help, which, anyway, is soon exhausted. Physical resources, too, are definitely limited. Yet there is no one who is not in need of kindness. And kindness, like all spiritual gifts, such as knowledge, love, and mercy, increases with giving.
Children need, above all things, kindness and love. Living in a world organized largely for the comfort, convenience, and advantage of grownups, they often live in fear of harsh words, scoldings, spankings, or indifference.
A friend told us of an ideal family where there were a large number of children, happy, cooperative, free from quarreling and wrangling. We asked her how she explained the success.
She replied, "I don't know, but their mother never raises her voice." This suggests strongly that the mother's charity includes patience and kindness.
Does kindness preclude discipline at home or in church work? Not at all! Discipline has the same root as disciple, which means learn, that is, to be a follower. The only effective discipline of a child's moral or spiritual nature is one which is preceded, followed, and surrounded with kindness. And kindness is born of charity and love.
Literature
The Bible in Our Literature
Lesson 2?How the Bible Is Woven into Our Literature
Dr. Howard R. Driggs
For Tuesday, November 25, 1945
SOME college students, taking a course in literature teaching, were stirred to active discussion one day by this statement from their instructor: "A good working knowledge of the Bible is absolutely essential to success in the teaching of our English and American literature."
"But we are not allowed to teach the Bible in the public schools," came a response.
"Not from any sectarian viewpoint," said the instructor. "It would be un-American to do so. Yet, how can our literature be adequately taught without constant reference to the Bible?"
"I am not sure just what you mean," said another student.
"Well, let us put some concreteness into the explanation. Most of you are teachers of literature. What are some selections you are called on to teach?"
"Evangeline," "Vision of Sir Launfal," "L'Envoi," "Snow-bound," came replies.
"They will serve our purpose," said the instructor. "Listen carefully now to some lines from the poems named:
And as she gazed from the window, she saw serenely the moon pass Forth from the folds of a cloud, and one star follow her footsteps, As out of Abraham's tent young Ishmael wandered with Hagar. ?"Evangeline," (Part III), Longfellow
Daily, with souls that cringe and plot, We Sinne climb and know it not. ?"Vision of Sir Launfal," Lowell
They shall find real saints to draw from? Magdalene, Peter, and Paul; They shall work at age at a sitting, and never get tired at? ?"L'Envoi," Kipling
"Take, eat," he said, "and be content, These fishes in my stead are sent By Him who sent the tangled ram, To spare the child of Abraham." ?"Snowbound," Whittier
"How can any of these, or hundreds of other lines containing like allusions, be explained without a knowledge of the Bible?"
"But aren't those examples somewhat old-fashioned?" asked a student.
"Your question seems to imply that modern authors are not weaving
the Bible into their creations. Well, here is a volume called Contemporary Verse. Perhaps it will help us to find an answer. Glancing through its table of contents I find a few titles that recall interesting hues: Poems are made by fools like me, But only God can make a tree. ?"Trees," Joyce Kilmer They gave their merry lives away For Country and for God. ?"Spires of Oxford," Winifred Betts And he who loves the least of these (And here I say and here repeat) Shall win himself an angel's pleas For mercy at my judgment seat. ?"The Outlaw," Robert Service Thank God for a world where none may shirk, Thank God for the splendor of work. ?"Work," Angela Morgan America! Americal God mend thine every flaw. Confirm thy soul in self control, Thy liberty in law. ?"America the Beautiful," Katharine Lee Bates Give them this for the morrow's meat, Then shall we feast in accord; Our half a loaf will then be sweet. Sweet as the bread of the Lord! ?"How Oswald Dined with God," Edwin Markham No one knows what will happen next, such portents fill the days and nights; Years prophetical! ?"Years of the Modern," Walt Whitman OK I go wherever men may dare, I go wherever woman's care And love can live? Wherever strength and skill can bring Surcease to human suffering Or solace give. ?"The Red Cross Spirit Speaks," John H. Finley Are not these lines from recent poetry all linked with the Bible? Joyce Kilmer's artistic tribute to God's surpassing power of creation; the touching lines of Winifred Betts to merry-hearted youth giving their all for country and for God; the use of precious words from the Savior by Robert Service; the gratitude expressed by Angela Morgan for God-given work?all clearly show that source of inspiration. In the prayer of Katherine Lee Bates for America?vital today and always ?that our liberty be preserved in Law, we feel the Bible spirit. It vibrates also in the lines of Edwin Markham, picturing a king sharing with the poor; and in Walt Whitman's words, so applicable to the living present. In John H. Finley's tribute to the Red Cross, one feels the helpful, courageous spirit of the Savior. In much of the literature of today the heart of the Good Samaritan vibrates. Such expression of gospel service is surely Bible-inspired. Of course, these illustrations from more modern poetry are somewhat different from those cited from earlier poets. Fashions change in literature as in other things; yet the constants are ever present. When the Bible came, it brought certain of these constants: reverence for God, charity, humility, service, sacrifice, a more democratic spirit, and other spiritual gifts for our salvation. It was like the pouring of a river, limpid and pure, into the old turbid stream of life. All our art expression since then has been clarified, enriched, inspirited by the divine contribution. LESSON DEPARTMENT 505 This is shown in both tangible and intangible changes wrought in our literature. As aleady illustrated, authors, particularly those of earlier years, made many more direct allusions to stories and characters of the Bible. It was the enriching thing to do. When Lowell, for example, says that daily "We Sinais climb and know it not," his line brings back the story of Moses going up into the mountain to commune with God. The poet also suggests that, without knowing it, we get close to God each day. To understand the inner meaning of this allusion, one must know the Bible story that lies back of it. Another tangible way the Bible is woven into lines of literature is by use of Biblical expressions-words, phrases, and even sentences. How deeply indebted our language is to this contribution may be more clearly realized by something of a comparison of literature today with that of pre-Bible days. Go back to the Northland myths for illustration. In these tales one finds a goodly number of words suggestive of brute strength, skill with weapons of trickery, cunning, deceit, of feasting, drinking, carousing, of giants, sorcery, mystery. Few, if any, words are found expressive of charity, meekness, kindliness, benevolence, tolerance, forgiveness, brotherhood, holidays (holy days). These, and like expressions of gospel import, came into our mother tongue largely through the Bible. Less tangible than words and allusions, yet even more vital, are the changes wrought through the influence of the Bible on the inner spirit of literature. It brought what may well be called a leavening effect on all forms of art. More hope, more joy, more faith, more whole-someness came to the varied kinds of expression. Naturally, literature was lightened and brightened and given added meaning and purpose by this spiritualizing force. With much of our great literature this infusion of new warmth and life and strength is to be felt rather than seen. Bible thought and themes are often so deftly woven into the creation by the author that, unless one is well-schooled in scripture, the close connection might be missed. Yet the stirring lessons of truth are there. It is the artistry of authorship not to preach them, but to portray them. In further studies, an interesting quest will be to find some of these Bible messages at the heart of time-tested literature. True it is that certain writers reveal precious little of Bible influence in what they produce. With cynical disregard of that source of inspiration, they have gone their own irreverent ways. Sometimes they create daring, cleverly-written literature, which, for the moment, wins wide attention. Then it as suddenly flickers out, as all such creations, if unsound and unwholesome, are almost sure to do. Folk may read, but few reread literature of that type. Our conviction is that authors do their finest, most lasting work when they are true to truth, when they produce that which is clean and artistic, when they help to overcome evil with good. There is no call here for "preach-iness" in literature; neither is there any exclusion of choice literature created for wholesome entertainment. Happily, we have many delightful creations which open our eyes and ears to the beauties of nature, to the joys of childhood, to home pleasures and uplifting friendships. Some of the selections help to cultivate in us a clean sense of humor, to get more pure enjoyment out of life. Outwardly or inwardly this literature may make no reference to the Bible; yet the spirit of goodness and wholesome fun is in it, and truly we need it to add a bit of leaven to our days. Something more than just this lightsome literature is also needed for our upbuilding. That is the literature which brings real re-creation. Such literature, as already portrayed, leaves us both mentally and spiritually uplifted. It brings to us lessons of truth and light. It leads us along paths of righteousness. It is Bible-inspired. Discussion and Activities 1. Why is a knowledge of the Bible essential in the study of English and American literature? Be ready with an illustration to prove the point. 2. (a) What is meant by a Biblical allusion? (b) Make your meaning clearer by giving in brief the incident or meaning suggested by each of the following expressions: "like showers of manna"; "toiling up new Calvaries"; "our Lord's beatitudes"; "in Eden's delight"; "like the Patmos saint." 3. (a) Join with the class in making a list of twenty or more words other than those given in this lesson, which probably have come into our language through the Bible, (b) What in a spiritual sense is indicated by this enrichment of our vocabulary? 4. In what other vital way than by allusions and words has the Bible influenced our literature? Illustrate. 5. What type of literature may show no such Biblical influence and yet be of value in our lives? Give illustrations. 6. What are some of the spiritual qualities that characterize literature that brings not only entertainment, but re-creation? Name one selection that you feel has these qualities. 7. Point out, with illustrations, a difference in the way authors of earlier times and today reflect the Bible influence in their writings. Science Modern Applications of Moral Principles Lesson 9?Problems of Personal Conduct Dr. Harold T. Christensen For Tuesday, November 27, 1945 Lesson link: We attempted last time to apply the moral principle of brotherhood to several specific social situations. It was shown how prejudice and animosity lead toward patterns of discrimination and persecution in the modern world. Religious intolerance was used as an example of the contemporary moral crisis in both Christianity and democracy. Lesson aim: To stress the importance of personal cleanliness, balanced conduct, and self-control to the good life. IT has been said earlier that the good life depends upon both personal and social factors; that the highest morality, which results in the greatest joy, comes from individual health and advancement plus love and service oriented toward others. Last month we looked at the brotherhood principle and examined a few of its perversions. This time we will turn attention to some of the moral problems of personal conduct.
Life is a process of continual adjustment to new situations, and where individuals lag or fail in their adjustment, personal and social problems result. Since the best adjustment means the most progress and the greatest happiness, anything short of the best possible adjustment is wrong. But adjustment is difficult, and there seems to be an all too-common human tendency to dodge that which is hard and remote in favor of the easy way leading to immediate thrills. Hence the prevalence of human suffering. When the energies of man become dissipated in the attempt to circumvent truth and escape consequences, opportunities are missed and misery ensues. It is to some of these dissipations leading to personal maladjustment and unhappiness that attention is now turned.
Drugs
The use of narcotics produces a temporary sense of pleasantness or well-being and permits the sufferer to forget for awhile his mental fears and conflicts. It is perhaps this element of escape from unpleasant reality that explains the rather wide
The proportion of the population addicted to the more serious drugs such as opium, heroin, morphine, and cocaine, is probably not very large; although occasionally we read of "dope rings" being uncovered and some authorities estimate that there are more than one million addicts in this country alone. Sometimes the habit is picked up innocently such as through the use of sleeping pills, pain-killers, or patent medicines. In using narcotic medicines, even under a doctor's prescription, great care should be exercised to use them moderately and only as absolutely needed. Once the habit is formed, the user's system has then become conditioned to the drug and he is a virtual slave to its use. Addiction to the use of drugs frequently results in poverty, ill-health, and crime, and the cure, if any be possible, requires rather long and expensive treatment at the hands of the psychiatrist.
A more serious problem than the taking of opiates and cocaine is the smoking of marijuana cigarettes?more serious because this drug is consumed largely by the young, because its results are particularly demoralizing, and because it may be even more widespread than the other practices. Under the influence of marijuana, restraint, moral judgment, and self-control are gone, and acts are frequently indulged in that head the boy and girl toward degradation. Marijuana comes from an innocent looking weed, and although many states by now have laws attempting its control, its suppression is proving particularly difficult. The taking of caffeine, nicotine, and other narcotic substances into the body through the use of certain drinks and through smoking is also habit forming and body harming. Our Church literature is replete with good material on these subjects. (See section 89 of the Doctrine and Covenants, and consult also some of the many articles and chapters on the Word of Wisdom found in the magazines and books of the Church.) Drink Just as drug addiction is an attempted escape from unpleasant reality and a crutch for unstable characters, so also is the use of alcoholic beverages. People who drink do so, for the most part, to forget the unpleasantries of life and to thereby capture the thrills of the moment. They fail to remember that no one can really escape life; he can only shut his eyes for awhile, stumble, and get behind in the race. The magnitude of the liquor problem is alarming. Some three or four billion dollars go into this industry in America each year, and, since alcohol is not a necessity, most of this is wasted money. But the greatest waste is human waste. Families are neglected and abused; lives are dissipated and shortened; accidents are increased, resulting in the death and maiming of many; morals are relaxed and crimes increased, particularly sex crimes; insanity very frequently overtakes the one so indulging. This human wreckage resulting from drink in the modern world, when all brought together, does not make a pretty picture. People who drink "to be a good sport" or because they think it is "smart" should remember that sportmanship without principle is a mirage, and that always the smart thing to do is the right thing. Those who drink to "forget" should remember that their euphoria is but illusionary and that in so behaving they only build up a vicious circle, for they only create more bad memories that they will want to forget. Gambling In one sense life is a gamble, for it is so filled with uncertainties and anomalies and it requires so much faith and courage to see it through. But there is a vast difference between this courage in the face of uncertainties in the struggle upward and the willful play on chance for the purpose of getting something for nothing; the one gives evidence of faith and results in effort and progress, while the other is based on selfishness and laziness alone. This "something for nothing" philosophy of life, coupled with the idea that "only the foolish work," makes of gambling an escape device designed to side-step morals for the sake of money. Large scale gambling involving cards, roulette wheels, and such, is illegal in most states; but illegal or not it finds ways of functioning under cover in many of the nation's "best" communities. Hidden from the police or "protected" by city officials, professional gamblers in especially prepared rooms encourage the gullible to participate in these nefarious activities; and through techniques well known to themselves, make sure that the "house" gets a heavy cut out of the winnings. LESSON DEPARTMENT 509 The spirit of gambling, once it has taken hold of a person, is like a narcotic or a liquor in its deadening and maddening effects. The thrill of an occasional win is enough to tide over several substantial losses and, in this way, keep the losing spiral going viciously downward until the participant's money is all gone. Always there is the thought, the desperate hope, that next time he can beat the game and then he will stop; but next time he loses once more, or, if he should win, there is the untempered greed that won't let him quit. Parents and community workers (and all parents should be vitally and actively interested in the welfare of the community) will do well to realize that the road to gambling frequently starts at the juvenile "joint" where there are marble games and slot machines to whet the appetite of the young. If these could be cleaned out or changed to eliminate the pay-off feature, as some of our communities have been farsighted enough to do, a great step in moral progress would be made. But this is not all. In addition, parents should teach their children that all things worth while cost effort, honestly and honorably given. Unchastity Sex life motivated by love and protected by marriage is sanctioned by society and blessed by deity. It is the misuse of sex that is immoral; practices impelled by selfish lust and irresponsible exploitation. That which is beautiful and sacred is too frequently cheapened and defiled by means of the vulgar remark, the smutty story, the erotic show, the lewd magazine, et cetera. Vulgarity is the profanity of virtue. When sexual irregularities are carried beyond the mental, the verbal, and the visual into the realm of overt conduct, the moral issue involved becomes particularly great. Unchastity, whether in premarital relations or extramarital relations after marriage, presents one of the most serious moral problems of the day. The following are some of the most important reasons for maintaining chastity: (1) It is a commandment of God. (2) It is sanctioned by society. The social stigma leveled by society against the offender often results in loss of both social position and employment, which is a high price to pay for a reckless moment. (3) It is necessary for mental health and peace of mind. The worries, fears, and guilt feelings connected with unchastity are sometimes enough to cause frustrations leading to chronic unhappiness, nervousness, and even psychosis. (4) It is important from the standpoint of physical health. The venereal diseases, resulting largely from sexual promiscuity, are among the most loathsome and miserable ailments of man. (5) It safeguards against premarital pregnancy followed by induced abortion, illegitimacy or forced marriage. (6) It is compatible with happy and successful marriage. In any number of ways unchastity may interfere with emotional and sexual adjustment in marriage. Statistical studies bear out the fact that those marriages are most successful where both partners have been chaste before the ceremony. To a Latter-day Saint there is no question of a double standard. Chastity is expected of the man and woman alike.
Excesses
Balance is a virtue that many, in their zeal to stress one certain point or principle fail to reach. Overemphasis on one thing usually means underemphasis on others, with the result that the total is misshapen. Things that are good in and of themselves are bad when overindulged in. Food, for example, is good, but overeating is a vice; fasting is a rich spiritual experience, but overfasting may lead to physical harm; athletics are good as exercise, but overtraining may burn the body out. It is possible to have too much of a good thing.
Because of this, it becomes ever so important that we learn to "see life steadily and as a whole." Distorted reality is, for all practical purposes, falsehood; and it leads to misdirected, abortive living.
In the field of personal conduct temperance is the keystone to virtue. The best way is the middle way. Life should be active, but in a balanced, harmonious way rather than impetuous or distorted. Steady is the word.
Anti-social Behavior
Every individual is an intrinsic part of society, and because of this it is impossible to make any clearcut distinction between public and private morals. All of these personal standards of which we have the lesson are harmful to society as well
as to the individuals who themselves indulge. Drinking, for example, may mean neglect of family, and unchastity may ruin two lives and bring sorrow to many others. Some people argue that, "What I do is my own business," but any thinking person can see that this is not true. We are our brother's keeper and our personal habits as well as our social acts affect profoundly those around us.
Anti-personal behavior then, is also anti-social behavior.
But some people go farther than this, and either thoughtlessly or willfully work against the best interests of the larger group. This is not the place to enter into any detailed analysis of crime and delinquency, but it is to be noted that the problem is extensive and that it is always greatest when personal disorganization is widespread, such as, for example, in time of war. Unless personal conduct can be made to be "right" in so far as the individual is concerned, and also right in the sense that it is directed toward the welfare of society, the standards of a higher morality will continue to be missed. It is the social slant in personal conduct that provides the highest moral test.
The Way Out
But regardless of how serious the problem may be, there is always a way out for those who are willing to plot the ground. There are too many today who, discouraged or blinded by the distance life has fallen, decide to lie there or even slip deeper rather than exert themselves for a better future. Life is
eternal, and progress is endless for those who climb; and every man can climb regardless of the point from which he must start. LESSON DEPARTMENT 511 The way out of the blind alleys in which many find themselves today is the way of repentance. Repentance is the key by which man can be unshackled from the follies of the past and the weaknesses of the present. More of us need to get the forward point of view. After a mistake has been made, as regrettable as it may be, it is then the future that is important. The past should be forgotten as rapidly as it can be atoned for. But repentance requires in addition to (i) remorse, both (2) restitution, and (3) reform; it is not enough to feel sorry, but the wrong done must be righted and the tendency to do wrong must be corrected. Man should learn to accept his mistakes as his own rather than projecting them upon society or the 'devil; and he should learn to repent, face the situation, throw away his crutches, and with his head up look and work for a better life. Problems for Thought and Action 1. Do you see any relationship between private and public morality? Explain. Show how the private behavior patterns discussed in this lesson affect others in society as well as the offender. 2. Analyze the major causes and effects of (a) drug addiction, (b) alcoholism, (c) gambling, and (d) unchastity. 3. Why is excess, or lack of balance, a moral problem? Discuss. Defend the "middle way" as a way of life. Does this justify the moderate use of tobacco, alcohol, et cetera? Why not? 4. What is meant by anti-social conduct? Are crime and delinquency immoral? Why? 5, What is the way out for the problem of personal conduct discussed in this lesson? Can you make any additional suggestions, being a little more specific, perhaps, than lesson space permitted here? What does repentance involve? Would you say that repentance is necessary to a moral life? Discuss pro and con.
