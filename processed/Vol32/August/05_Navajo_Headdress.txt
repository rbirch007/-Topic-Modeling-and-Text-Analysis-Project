NAVAJO HEADDRESS William Luce 1. One of the distinguishing features of the Navajo is his headdress, This same headdress is worn by both the men and women and is especially striking because of its simplicity. Many now use the modern comb but a few still use a bundle of tied together instead. The hair, comb, and strands of yarn are only requisites for milady's hair-do, The two women are the wife and daughter of Jack Frank who sometimes reside at Blanding, Utah. 2. After a thorough combing, the hair is gathered together. 3. Then the center of the yarn is twisted around the hair close to the head. 4. The two ends of the yarn are held by the younger squaw while her mother rolls the hair by lapping it over and over. 5. The rest of the yarn is now twisted around the knot of hair and tied. 6. And the finished coiffure! More songs were sung, and as the fire began to die and children slept, the violin and all present sang "The Spirit of God Like a Fire Is Burning" and truly it was! Dawn brought a gorgeous, shimmering Sabbath atop the mountains. There were bacon and eggs salted with sand and flavored with smoke. There was the clang of sheep bells, and the cook at the neighboring camp calling "Come and get it." And then All gathered in a circle in a grove of shining, silver-coated aspens. What a temple! Carpeted with tall spreading ferns, embroidered with pink, gold and purple flowers, it was topped with a turquoise sky! The purple, red, yellow, and orange blouses and shirts of the participants stood out in gay relief against the green above and beneath. What a picture I beheld as I looked up the sloping stage where Brother Ralph Evans, President of the Navajo-Zuni Mission, stood, with hand raised in welcome, and waiting beside him was the violinist, Clarence (Joe) Hunt, with bow ready for action. The latter was a friend of President Evans, from Blanding, whom he had not seen since "swimming hole" days. Instantly I pictured them as boys holding their noses and going down into the water in a splash of boyish ecstasy. Now they stood before me, clean, tall men fired with divine enthusiasm, ready to "feed my sheep." A grove of aspens has always suggested the Sacred Grove to me, and that thought raced through my mind just as the violin softly played "Oh How Lovely Was the Morning" and Mary Jumbo and her two girls sang the words beautifully. Then George Bloomfield told the story of Joseph Smith's first vision; of his receiving and translating the plates; of Christ's coming to the American continent; of Moroni's promise; and then he very forcefully urged these people to appreciate their book, and closed with his testimony. There was a brief pause after Clyde, the interpreter, finished. Then little, quiet, shining-eyed, immaculately dressed Sister Polacca stood up and told of a manifestation which brought her into the Church. I had heard this related several times before, and it was now told exactly as it had been told on every occasion before, but the setting, the aspen filled grove, and her big, brown eyes looking deeply into my soul as she spoke, gave me the impulse to take her into my arms and crush her to me and bathe her with my grateful tears. Thus I did at the close of the meeting. People wept unashamed, and everyone knew that she had spoken the truth and that she was a choice spirit touched by the divine and raised up to lead her people in the path of righteousness. Then the white people were asked to move back, and every Navajo sat at her feet while she told of this manifestation all over again in her native language.
The meeting was closed, and as I gathered the children and trudged up the hill to its lunch, a feeling of resentment filled me at the thought of breaking so fine and perfect a spiritual thread to perform the earthly task of eating.
The afternoon meeting was rich with testimonies of both white and Navajo missionaries. Children of both races sang and spoke. We had been together a long time, and the white people were showing signs of fatigue. President Evans said, "The sun is getting low, and you are tired. I'll leave it to you shall I talk to you or shall we go home?" An old, white-haired Navajo man slowly uncrossed his legs and said, "When the sun goes down, the moon will come up, so let us have the talk." What philosophy, and how we whites need it in this rushing world! After the talk, the natives still wanted more and the war news was given them.
The long-looked-for conference was over; farewells were said, and we were the last to leave. It had all been perfect. As we reached the summit, there came, almost as a grand finale, the form of a huge, shaggy brown bear and her cub crossing the red-gold path of the setting sun.
