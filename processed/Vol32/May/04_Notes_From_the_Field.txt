NOTES FROM THE FIELD Vera W. Pohlman Former General Secretary-Treasurer Regulations governing the submittal of material for "Notes from the Field" appeal in the Magazine for February 1944, page 104.CAMPAIGNS
Cottonwood Stake
THIS stake has demonstrated that success may be attained by working steadily toward a goal. In 1942, this stake's rate of Magazine subscriptions was among the lowest in the Church?26 per cent. Stake and ward Relief Society workers, determined to increase the rate, made the greatest numerical increase in the Church during 1943 (from 211 to 580 subscriptions) but, nevertheless, fell slightly short of the honor roll with 71 per cent of their members as subscribers. They still persisted in their efforts, and now appear on the honor roll for 1944 with a stake rate of 90 per cent, and with 6 of 8 wards represented.
Merle S. Muir, stake counselor in charge of the Magazine, wrote of this accomplishment:
"It is a satisfying climax to a huge effort and one of which we are very proud. This happens to be the first time in the history of our stake that we have been fortunate enough to achieve the honor roll. We hope it won't be the last. You will notice our subscription rate is 90 per cent for the stake and that 5 wards have over 100 per cent. All credit is due our ward Magazine representatives and officers for their effort and support. We found them willing and enthusiastic workers, and I'm sure the satisfaction they feel in their ward and stake report repays them for their efforts. As a stake we appreciate beyond words their efforts.
"Our biggest desire now is that each will read and enjoy her Magazine and realize the spiritual and temporal help it gives. As a stake we express our appreciation to the Magazine staff for the splendid Magazine they give us. We enjoy and appreciate the privilege of working in the Relief Society and the association it gives us."
Zion Park Stake
JESSIE H. GIBSON, stake Magazine representative, wrote last January commending the ward Magazine representatives and officers for their efforts which placed this stake on the 1944 honor roll with a rate of 91 per cent. Five of the 7 wards of this stake also appear on the honor roll with high rates.
Her letter continues: "We feel especially proud of the record of Della Hardy, Magazine representative of Springdale Ward, who has placed the Magazine in every home in her community whether members of our Church or not. Several Magazines were also sent to other communities as Christmas presents. NOTES FROM THE FIELD 315 She exceeded her good 1943 rate of 86 per cent by the exceptional rate of 154 per cent for 1944. We feel that her leadership deserves a little special mention and hope it will inspire other Magazine representatives to try a little harder next year." Boise Stake CAROL R. FLAKE, president of * the Boise Fourth Ward Relief Society, wrote last August: "At the suggestion of Dorothy Clapp Robinson, counselor in the Boise Stake Relief Society and supervisor of the Magazine representatives, I am sending in this account of our 'Dollar Day' which launched our Magazine campaign. Lillis Me-lander is our representative. "A large group of our sisters met in the pleasant surroundings of Elm Grove Park where a program was presented featuring the importance of the Magazine to the entire family. Talks on the subject. Things I Like About the Magazine' gave interesting and varied reasons for having it in the home. Our stake Relief Society president, Josephine Anderson, and Counselor Dorothy Clapp Robinson, commended us for our achievement of 104 per cent in the 1943 campaign and urged us to include at least 6 subscriptions this year to be sent to our Church missionaries. Accordingly, our members deposited voluntary contributions in an attractive dish which was afterwards awarded as prize to the one guessing nearest to the correct total of $8.14 which was received. "The program was interspersed with the singing of several original Magazine pep songs composed by various members, including the following: HERE IS OUR MAGAZINE Irene Read Tune "Idaho" (State song) You've heard of the wonders of our Magazine And all of the good it can do. It educates, stimulates, brings out the best But not half has been told to you. Chorus So here is our Magazine, Winning its way to the top. Once you've subscribed it will always come, You never will let it stop. You will read it, morn, noon, and night. Keep it in sight?'twill make your life bright. You will love it, its praises you'll sing, Sing of our Magazine. Our agent will take your subscription today. And benefits soon you will glean. When your family looks forward each month for the day When the postman brings their Magazine/ I'LL SUBSCRIBE FOR ANOTHER YEAR Edith Mathews Tune "Auld Lang Syne" Is my subscription up to date? I surely want to know. I cannot miss a single book Because I need it so. Our Magazine, our Magazine, Its pages I hold dear, I need its influence in our home? I'll subscribe for another year!" As indicated by the foregoing report, the Boise Stake Relief Society officers suggested that each ward contribute 6 gift subscriptions for women in foreign missions, and some of the wards exceeded this assignment. The stake board itself set the example, sending in seven gift subscriptions, one in the name of each ward of the stake. This is another stake which exceeded its good 1943 rate of 80 per cent by a 1944 rate of 95 per cent for the stake as a whole. Five of the 7 wards appear on the honor roll, all of them with rates well above those of last year, four of them over 100 per cent. Western States Mission LUCEAL R. CURTIS, recently released Relief Society president of this mission, wrote in September 1944: "Since March 17 our mission has had as one of its projects the binding ofs. One Relief Society now has a complete set of the Magazines bound and in its library. Two other Societies have 7 bound volumes and a great number have 3. These Magazines were bound to celebrate my three years in the mission. When they had them bound they sent, on July 15, a birthday card stating that they now had in their libraries bound volumes of the Magazine for 1941-42-43." For the third successive year this mission has achieved a place on the honor roll, this year with a higher rate of 81 per cent, and with nineteen of thirty-five branches represented, thirteen of them with rates of 100 per cent or over, including Sheridan Branch with the exceptional rate of 157 per cent.OPENS THE DOOR SPIRITUAL LITERACY SOCIAL KNOWLEDGE Magazine Campaign Poster, West Ensign Ward, Ensign Stake. Luendah E. Hagen was the Magazine representative of this ward. Ensign Stake LEONE H. ELIASON, stake Magazine representative of this stake which appears on the honor roll with a stake rate of 78 per cent and with four of six wards represented, suggested that each of the ward representatives make a poster for display in each Relief Society room. Each poster was to be original, to give some indication of the value derived from the lessons and other material published in the Magazine, to create interest in the Magazine among non-subscribers, and to serve as a constant reminder to subscribers to renew promptly. At a party held at the close of the campaign month, October in this stake, each ward representative was asked to bring her poster, and the display created much interest. The NOTES FROM THE FIELD 317 poster of the West Ensign Ward, conceded to be the best, is here reproduced. It aided the ward Magazine representative, Luendah E. Hagen, to reach the rate of 82 per cent with which this ward appears on the honor roll. A close second in popularity was the colorful poster of the South Twentieth Ward, depicting a cottage framed in trees, with a spacious lawn in front allowing for well-placed flower beds and borders. As subscriptions were received, the garden bloomed with tiny, bright-colored straw flowers, artistically glued in place. The energetic subscription gardener, Leone Seiter, appears on the honor roll with 131 subscriptions to her credit and a rate of 102 per cent. A feature of the party for ward representatives was the surprise demonstration of selling the Magazine which was given by Hazel Spencer of the North Eighteenth Ward (on the honor roll with 140 subscriptions, 79 per cent), with stake Relief Society president, Alice B. Steinicke, as the potential subscriber. Sister Eliason concludes that some of the qualifications of a successful Magazine representative are enthusiasm, willingness to serve, cheerfulness, and familiarity with Magazine content in order to be able to acquaint others with its value. MAGAZINE GIFT SUBSCRIPTIONS In 1944, as in previous years, many gift subscriptions were received at the Magazine office from individuals and from ward and stake Relief Societies for distribution at the discretion of the Magazine office. These gift subscriptions are received with great appreciation by those to whom they are sent, principally missionaries and officers of new mission branch Relief Societies who may not have been able to subscribe immediately themselves. During 1944, these generous and thoughtful gifts aggregated $100 and came from all the wards of Boise Stake, Shelley First and Fifth Wards of the Shelley Stake, Worland and Byron Wards of Big Horn Stake, Tremon-ton Ward of Bear River Stake, Farmington Ward of South Davis Stake, and from Mt. Jordan stake board and the following wards of Mt. Jordan Stake?Crescent, Draper First and Second, Sandy Second and Third. COMMENTS FROM MAGAZINE REPRESENTATIVES I regret very much to inform you this will be my last year as Magazine representative in Twin Groves Ward, Yellowstone Stake, as we have left the ward and moved into town. I never have done anything in the Church I have loved and enjoyed more, and my prayers and wishes will always be that Twin Groves will never fail to subscribe 100 per cent for this wonderful Magazine. We have 32 members enrolled in our ward... With 42 subscriptions or 131 per cent, the largest I have ever obtained and it really gives me a great thrill?Pearl Rigby, St. Anthony, Idaho. By the end of the year the rate for this ward was 145 per cent. I did my best to keep my promise to you. The sisters were very good to cooperate with me. I worked on the husbands, daughters, and sons the week before Mother's Day which helped a lot. Their faces would light up as if a great load had been lifted when I suggested the Magazine as a gift to mother. They would take the receipt and enclose it with their Mother's Day card. I work from eight to twelve hours a day in our grocery store besides caring for my three children and my home, so I can't do much Church work at the present time. I feel, however, I am doing a little something by getting Theinto the homes. One of the inclosed subscriptions is a gift from myself to a friend who is not a member and I hope the Magazine will help to do missionary work.? Irene Hardy, Susanville, California. This Magazine representative appears on the honor roll with a rate of 90 per cent. COMMENTS FROM MAGAZINE READERS Inclosed please find one dollar for subscription for the Magazine. It might interest you to know that I have been a constant subscriber for the Magazine ever since it was first published and still enjoy reading it at the age of 85 years.?Salt Lake City, Utah. I am sending in one dollar for renewal of mysubscription. I enjoy the Magazine ever so much as we are now so far from our nearest Church that it is just impossible for us to attend. Fifty miles is quite a long drive on our present gas ration and therefore I enjoy my Magazine even more than most. ?Healdsburg, California. Thanks for a good Magazine that is still the same in price and value, in spite of high prices and shortage of material and help.?Snowville, Utah. Have neglected writing to you and letting you know how much I thought of Thelma Ireland's poem "Moonlight on the Mountains." I have it framed and also it was read at the Woman's Club, and the P. E. O. Of this city. We thought it fine ?Creighton, Nebraska. Because of illness I have neglected sending in my renewal to our Magazine, but I won't miss a single copy of it. At this time I wish to express my appreciation of the wonderful way you are editing it? such clean contents from cover to cover? such advice, comfort and inspiration. It is a beacon light to me and an anchor to my soul.?Robin, Idaho. You'll never know how I enjoy Theevery month. Thank you so much.?Hondo, California. I thank the General Board, the editors and contributors, and all who are concerned with the making of the Magazine for the beautiful things that have come to me through its pages.?Helper, Utah. I enjoy my copies of the Magazine very much and shall continue to be a pleased subscriber. You are doing a very good work.?Logan, Utah. Just a brief word of appreciation for the Magazine. I have taken it from the first year and enjoy it more each issue. Thank you again for a fine and uplifting publication.?Charlotte B. Davies. I am just writing you a few lines to let you know how much I have enjoyed my Magazine. Never in my life have I gotten more good or consolation out of a book. I hope others enjoy theirs like I do mine.?Bremerton, Washington. I just want to thank you for the wonderful little Magazine. It is such a help to us in these awful days of war and I enjoy reading it after the day's work is done. What a wonderful testimony it brings? it strengthens my testimony of the gospel. Inclosed is one dollar to pay another year's subscription.?Boise, Idaho. The Magazine is a great comfort and companion to me in my loneliness. I have belonged to the Relief Society for about NOTES FROM THE FIELD 319 fifty years for which I am very grateful and proud-North Hollywood, California. We are a very young branch but are following the lessons and are thrilled with them. Words cannot express how we appreciate our wonderfulIt is inspirations.-Spokane, Washington. My husband is a splendid booster for the Magazine. We read it together and he likes it as well as any other magazine he reads he reads?Pasadena, California. COMMENTS FROM MAGAZINE WRITERS I can't remember whether or not I wrote you concerning the contest poems and stories this year. I thought the poems were exceptionally good. Mrs. Crawford's so helpful, timely, and with her usual lovely spirit showing through; Mrs. Coles with her high grade poetry and high emotional quality; and Mrs. Miner with her abundant faith Ogden, Utah. I am always very proud to publish in TheSalt Lake City. You present the material so attractively it's always a great satisfaction to me to have a poem published in your Magazine. ?Silverdale, Washington. For some time now I have been wanting to write to you about the Magazine. There have been so many things lately that I have enjoyed.... I liked the story "Mama's Boy." It carries such a wonderful message without seeming to preach, besides it is well written. I think we all enjoy our preaching better when it is hidden rather than held up to view?in stories I mean. I always enjoy those child stories of Olive Woolley Burt's.... The series of articles about painters by Mrs. Home have been especially pleasing to me. I had no idea we (the Church) had so many women who have distinguished themselves in that line. I liked the story of the Big Horn Basin, too.... The poets in this part of Idaho appreciate the market you give them. With all good wishes for your continued success.?Boise, Idaho. Ten Miles to Calico (Concluded from page 291) ?Five miles to calico! Five miles to calico!" Then she laughed. ?Ten miles to calico! Ten miles to calico!" What did it matter that she'd have to go to town twice for it? Her calico was in the store, waiting. She was going to look beautiful, like a daffodil! For Frank! Now she would walk home as fast as she could until the last mile. Then she'd run. So ma could have her caster set in the middle of the table while they ate supper. (The End) MORNING Susa Gould Walker A quivering stillness? The warbling of a wren; The fresh, sweet scent of dew-drenched lilac blooms. A smile, and two blue eyes Above a crib, and then My life made sweet, as sunshine floods the rooms. All-Year Care of the Rose Beds (Concluded from page 286) protection is seldom needed for roses in the Salt Lake valley, but in colder localities the plants must be protected.
The best protection is a mound of earth applied over each plant after freezing weather has arrived. This should be kept at hand ready to apply, manure can then be used to fill in the space between, but should not be applied directly over the plant during winter months. In very cold sections where the temperatures stay below zero for long periods, it is well to use additional protection of branches of trees, shrubs, corn stalks or other loose material on top of the mound of earth and manure.
And so we come to the end of the story. Does this sound so very formidable? When once these simple tasks are learned, they become a pleasure, for their rewards are so great. Can one measure such small undertakings against the privilege of plucking flowers of such perfection and beauty as the rose! Can one coldly calculate a few hours of effort scattered over the year when they bring us roses to cheer and comfort, to speak their message of beauty and love!
