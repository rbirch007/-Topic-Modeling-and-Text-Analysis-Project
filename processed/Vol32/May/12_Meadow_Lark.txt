MEADOW LARK Grace M. Candland Returning friend of early spring, I hear Your call from low, green marsh and leafing tree, A lilting song of joyous melody Divinely sweet to each attentive ear. And then my heart grows light, I seem to know That His kind care, perhaps, had thought of me. And of my need of just such ecstacy When clouds obscured the way that I should go. May I, like you, blithe messenger, renew In some despairing life the will to see That lowly things send forth incessantly A song of life that thrills one through and through. Dear meadowlark, your floating notes of bliss Are one rare treat I would not care to miss.
