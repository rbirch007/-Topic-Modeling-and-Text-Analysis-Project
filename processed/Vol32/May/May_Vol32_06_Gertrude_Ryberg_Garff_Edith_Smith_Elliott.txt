Gertrude Ryberg Garff Second Counselor in General Presidency, April 1945 Edith Smith Elliott THE wise selection of Gertrude Ryberg Garff as second counselor to President Belle Smith Spafford of the Latter-day Saint Relief Society will be a blessing to the women of the Church. Her training and background fit her admirably for her new position. Above all else, she has a firm testimony of the gospel of Jesus Ghrist, and although young in years, she is old in experience. Sister Garff was born in Hyrum, Utah, to Charlotte Critchlow and Eric William Ryberg. Both the Critchlows and the Rybergs contribute a rich heritage to Gertrude. Her mother's forbears rank high in early educational fields and were participants in the American Revolution. Sister Ryberg has been a leader, active in Relief Society. Gertrude's father's parents were converts to the Church from Sweden. They settled in Logan, Utah, and played a forceful part in the development of that community. Brother Ryberg has been a successful contractor and is an outstanding executive in the business world. Sister Garff was five years old when the family moved to Salt Lake City in Wasatch Ward. She is fortunate to have had parents who trained her in the paths of knowledge and righteousness. She has always had great faith in her Heavenly Father, which has been a great source of comfort to her. She has been a firm believer in the fact that GERTRUDE R. GARFF *'faith without works is dead," so she has willingly done her part.   She completed her early studies in the Salt Lake City schools. Desiring further knowledge and training, she entered the University of Utah. At the end of her second year she received and honored a call to fill a mission for her Church. She was assigned to the Eastern States Mission under the presidency of Brother James H. Moyle. Here she labored as a field missionary in Jamestown, New York, and in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Her special assignment was radio work. Her mission strengthened her testimony in the divinity of Christ and gave her a religious schooling that has helped pattern her life.
Her mission furthered her desire for learning. She knew that the "glory of God is intelligence," so when she returned home she once more entered the University and graduated in 1935 with a Bachelor of Science degree. Her major was in textiles, with a minor in foods and child welfare.
IN October 1935, she married Mark Brimhall Garff, son of Tryphena Brimhall (sister of President George Brimhall) and George P. Garff. She had met her future husband (who had been home two years from a Danish mission) at a Granite Stake conference where they had both been called upon to discuss their missionary experiences.
In September 1937, Brother and Sister Garff were again called to the Lord's service this time to preside over the Danish Mission with headquarters in Copenhagen. Their son Mark was only two and one-half months old so this made the planning for so long a journey a major problem. However, with faith in God they lost no time settling to the task before them. Both were very young to be given so important an assignment but, in spite of this, they made an enviable record. Sister Garff learned the language so that she could assume her full responsibilities as head of the women's auxiliaries, with a special and personal interest in Relief Society. She won the love and trust of the Danish saints. Her warmth and understanding made her role as "mission mother" a source of strength to the
in the welfare of young people was ever apparent not has it even ceased since she returned to Zion.
Besides discharging her many missionary duties admirably, Gertrude found time to study the social, historical, economic, and cultural aspects of the Danes. She learned to love and appreciate these Norsemen. A lover of art, crafts, literature, and music, she spent any free time she had in museums, art galleries, and opera houses.
She enjoyed the companionship of her baby. She used to take him with her on bicycle rides in and around Copenhagen tucked into the baby's seat on the front of her bicycle.
When the war clouds gathered and broke into World War II, our missionaries were called home. The first available space that President Garff could obtain to transport his wife, little son, and several Scandinavian missionaries to home shores was on a tramp steamer. President Garff had to remain to reorganize the mission on a local basis. We can well imagine the anxiety of that parting. Faith alone made it possible. The ship had to take a northern route up around Iceland for safety. The voyage lasted seventeen days and the passage was unusually rough. Gertrude and the baby arrived home in November, in time to spend thanksgiving with her father and mother. By Christmas, President Garff returned safely and the little family was grateful to be reunited.
The following January 1940, Sister Garff was appointed a member of the General Board of Relief Society under its new president, Amy Brown Lyman. Sister Garff and Sister Lyman had developed a close friendship in Europe which Sister Lyman was presiding over the women's auxiliaries of the European mission. Sister Garff has said of her many occasions that she doesn't know how she could have carried on her great responsibilities had it not been for Sister Lyman's frequent letters of direction and encouragement. Sister Lyman's deep understanding of people and their problems, with her helpful disposition made it natural for Gertrude to turn to her for counsel and advice. She was very happy to be called into a continued association with so noble a character.
Sister Garff is friendly and approachable. She works well with people. She has the courage of her convictions, yet is pliable to the extent that if she is shown a better way she willingly accepts it. She attacks each assignment with an open-mindedness intelligence.
Gertrude and Mark have three young children: Mark R. (eight years), Charlotte (four years), and baby Georgia (one and one-half years). These human treasures along with her splendid husband receive her untiring devotion.
From her husband, her father, and her mother, she will receive maximum support in her new position.
