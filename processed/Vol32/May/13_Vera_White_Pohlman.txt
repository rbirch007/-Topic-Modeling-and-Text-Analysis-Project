Vera White Pohlman General Secretary-Treasurer, 1940-45 President Belle S, Spafford FEW persons called to a position of trust and responsibility come to that position better qualified through native ability, training, and experience than did Vera White Pohlman when, in January 1940, she was called to serve as general secretary-treasurer of Relief Society. Thoroughly familiar with the history, rulings, and policies of the Society, acquainted with General Board office procedures, having a knowledge of the requirements of Reliei Society Magazine work, and intimate with the work of the Relief Society welfare department through twelve years of previous service in the general offices, her Relief Society background was rich. Prior to her appointment as general secretary-treasurer she had served with the Salt Lake County Department of Public Welfare, where she organized recording and filing systems and supervised the stenographic and clerical staff. She had also been employed as statistician with the State Emergency Relief Administration (F. E. R. A.) which was succeeded by the State Department of Public Welfare, where she served as director of its bureau of research and statistics, contributing much to the development and establishment of its policies and procedures, and to the training of personnel in this new function of state government in Utah. VERA W. POHLMAN All of this experience was invaluable in her Relief Society assignment which had so much to do with welfare work, important record keeping, the formulating and establishment of rulings, policies, and procedures, and the training of personnel. At the time of the appointment of Vera W. Pohlman as general secretary-treasurer, Mrs. Amy W. Evans wrote of her: "With her natural ability for details, her experience in welfare work, her fund of information regarding and thorough understanding of all phases of Relief Society work, her faithfulness to trust, and her dependability, Mrs. Pohlman will make a very efficient and valuable general secretary." Page  This prognostication has indeed been fulfilled. Her record of efficient service to the Society in this responsible position will ever stand a credit to her and a blessing to the Relief Society. Vera W. Pohlman has a brilliant and an analytical mind. She has a marvelous capacity not only to quickly and clearly see a problem or a situation, but to see all that is in any way related to it; she readily recognizes the influence of one situation upon another and can accurately foresee results of action. This rare capacity has made her of inestimable value in executive councils, in committee work, and as a member of the General Board, enabling her to arrive at sound conclusions and to guide others to do likewise. Mrs. Pohlman is a tireless, enduring worker. No amount of time or effort is considered, nor is any thought of saving herself allowed to enter into the performance of her duties. During the early years of her incumbency as general secretary-treasurer when, in addition to the regular duties incident to this position, she was reorganizing the offices and setting up new and more economical and efficient systems of management, she also carried a tremendous responsibility and did a vast amount of work in connection with Relief Society centennial plans and activities. During this period she worked long into the night, denying herself recreation and relaxation. Every minute was devoted to duty. THERE are few people who take greater pride in their work than does Vera Pohlman. Careful, painstaking, accurate effort accompanies all that she does from the smallest unimportant bit of work to the heaviest and most essential of tasks. Perfection is her standard of measurement. Vera fully appreciates the importance of the Relief Society cause. She loves the women of the Church and has a sincere desire to serve them. She continuously strives to make things clear, easy, and convenient for them, and she is never happier than when she feels she has been of service. She has met with thousands of Relief Society women in her visits to the stakes and missions of the Church. In 1943 she traveled continuously from early September until mid-December, meeting with Relief Society women representing 142 stakes and missions. The many expressions of appreciation for these visits bear evidence of the regard felt for her by Relief Society women because of her efficiency and knowledge of Relief Society work, and of their love and admiration for her because of her willingness to serve them. Special mention should here be made of a few of Mrs. Pohlman's special contributions to Relief Society. She has prepared new, simplified visiting teacher report books, and has revised ward and stake record books. The revised record books allow for the inclusion of valuable information, much of which was formerly not included, particularly with regard to the sewing program. This information permits a clear picture of the status of all phases of Relief Society work and materially aids the General Board to better plan and more effectively direct the Society. Mrs. Pohlman's personal ability to interpret figures and give them life and vitality is a rare gift.
In 1941, she prepared family record forms for use of Relief Society presidents in making a family analysis. These forms, endorsed by the Church Welfare Plan, are in use at the present time and are a guide and an asset to Relief Society presidents in analyzing the situation of families under care and in making sound recommendations to bishops regarding family needs.
Relief Society publications have benefited by the skills and knowledge of Vera W. Pohlman. She is a gifted writer, meticulous in the preparation of material for publication and is familiar with technical publishing details. She has continuously edited "
