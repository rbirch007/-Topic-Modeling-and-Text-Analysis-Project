TO MY GRANDCHILDREN Maude Hatch Benedict When I am gone, will eager children look Within the pages of this timeworn book, Their questing eyes find nothing here to show Fulfilled ambition, finished task; will they know Pride?that I left footprints here below? Will all the little tasks of love be lost Forever, as a fluff of thistledown-No heartache, tears, frustration's cost. Nor valor shown, when I am gone-No thing of me to spur them to go on? Or will they say of me, "she still belongs. Her life was made of sunshine and of songs, Where she walked some radiant memory Of charm, of wit, of kindliness in giving, The paths she trod made surer by her living!" 4 Will they smile, a wee bit wistfully, While thumbing through this dog-eared old scrapbook- And for a moment will they pause to listen For my heartbeat in its pages; will they look Further, wishing to know more of me. And close the book?a tear left to my memory!
