GOLD-GREEN DAY Eva Willes Wangsgaard It doesn't matter to this gold-green day That war's unnatural thunder tears the earth; For such is full ten thousand miles away, And April is concerned with life and birth. The tulips lift enameled bowls knee-high, The cups and saucers of the daffodils Are hung like new-dipped pottery to dry, From hyacinths, star-bottled perfume spills. Here life is gentle, an insistent force That reaches ever up, with death a friend Incipient in leaf and bud, whose course Runs parallel, a haven in the end. War leans his weight with death, but April weaves New life from broken forms the earth receives. The Cover: The cover "Proud Parents" is from a photograph by Grace O. Tuttle taken on the Deschutes River at Bend, Oregon. "
