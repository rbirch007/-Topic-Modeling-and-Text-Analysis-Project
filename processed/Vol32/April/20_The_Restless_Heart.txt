THE RESTLESS HEART Courtney E. Cottam Do not seek for me in the quiet heart Of a June-blown, golden rose, Nor in the twilight-shadowed pause That marks the daytime's close. Look for me where the poppy breaks, In a splash of flaming red; Where lightning opens a silver path. There my dancing feet will tread. For mine is a restless, burning heart. That spurns the weakling's cry; My pagan soul serves the storm god's might-In spirit, the fearing die!
