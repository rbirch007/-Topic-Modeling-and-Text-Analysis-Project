COME AND GROW OLD WITH ME Bertha A. Kleinman Come and grow old with me. As trees grow old, Each season adding newer, finer wood? A timbered arch defying storm and cold, And nobler for adversity withstood. God made a tree? He likewise fashioned me To brave the rain, the thunder?shock and blast, A weathered oak that sheds security, From fruited boughs uplifted to the last. Come and grow old with me. The eventide Is rich with harvest after storm and strife; There is no age, for where the Gates swing wide New wood still blossoms on the Tree of Life!
