Look Unto the Rock, Whence Ye Are Hewn" Elder Daryl Chase Director of Latter-day Saint Institute, Logan, Utah IN recent years we have had many reappraisals of our national history. Since the outbreak of war, with all of its cost in treasure and lives, Americans have been attempting to evaluate democracy and discover how we reached our present national position of power from the simple, tragic beginnings of Jamestown and Plymouth of three hundred years ago.
American history is being rewritten in the agony of our present suffering and in the hope which we cherish of a better world. This does not mean that any significant changes will be made in our dates of history. Children will give the same answers as their grandfathers did regarding such questions as, "When was America discovered? How many sailed on the Mayflower?" etc.
On the other hand, better answers to the questions which follow must be made by young Americans than were made by their fathers, if we are to build on the political and spiritual foundations of Jamestown and Plymouth. I refer to such questions as these: What were the driving motives of the early American colonizers? What were the basic political ideals back of the instruments of government established by them? Can the marked differences which are apparent between the Spanish and English settlers in the New World be explained by the accidents of discovery (by the direction the wind happened to blow their ships), or must these differences be accounted for by factors quite outside the category of winds, rivers, harbors, and precious metals?
At the present time, there is a definite shift on the part of the interpreters of America's past from their emphasis on her material strength to that of her spiritual heritage. This shift is definitely in the direction of historical accuracy, and at the same time will serve as a morale builder to all thoughtful citizens. Men do not want to suffer or die, merely to shift a border or to keep their country the richest nation on earth.
It seems to the writer that it would be well for Latter-day Saint historians and Church interpreters of the past to follow the current trend of our secular historians and rewrite much of our early Church history with a shift in emphasis upon the purely religious and spiritual heritage of the saints.
A Latter-day Saint student may know the exact dates and places of every important event in Church history and remain quite ignorant of the real significance of the past to him. I once had a supervisor visit my class and demonstrate "how to teach Church history. The period lasted fifty minutes, and the whole time was spent in teaching the students the exact distance from Palmyra to the Smith farm. I think that all readers of this article will agree that a few minutes spent on the geographical setting of the Smith farmstead would have been time well spent, but the major part of that 50-minute period should have been occupied, not in pointing out how far the Prophet was from New York City, but rather how close he was to God.
Chronologies and assembled quotations from past leaders will never supply sufficient spiritual nutriment for the growing youth of any age. And at the present time, when the basic beliefs and practices of the Latter-day Saints are being attacked at home and abroad, the student is forced far below the surface of history when he attempts to protect the Church, or when he searches the past for some meaning of the present or for guidance into the future.
AS I reflect upon the early history of the Church, several very important facts emerge from all the names and dates and geography associated with our beginnings. One is this: The Restored Church is very young. Many great and worthwhile achievements have already been made to the everlasting credit of the Church, but this fact still remains: One hundred and fifteen years is a very short time in the life of a vital, growing institution, and every Latter-day Saint should be aware of this important fact of his history.
Young men and women are delighted to learn that everything has not been done for them either in the Church or in the nation. It is thrilling to everyone to help build a beautiful ward or stake house or temple, but good janitors and watchmen of any structure are very difficult to find because such work is dull and uninteresting. Young people can become very enthusiastic about contributing to a young church (which we are), but may remain quite indifferent to a call merely to protect an old institution.
I can never read very far in Church history without feeling that we are still in our beginnings, that only the foundation stones have been laid for this spiritual structure which we call the Church, and I am sure that many Latter-day Saints share this point of view with me. I once asked a brilliant young college teacher why he was converted to the Church what it was that first attracted him to Mormonism. He replied that first, it was the good lives of several Latter-day Saints whom he knew that did appeal and second, it was the attractive fact that this Church is young and is on the offensive, whereas the church which he grew up in was very old and was merely living on the material and spiritual resources of an ancient past. He said: "I am a Mormon; I can help build a future with my faith, my education, and my talents; here is a young, living organism; in the church I left I felt that the best I could do was to protect an ancient monument."
When we look below the surface of our beginning, we soon discover another fact: We are not only very young, but, like the Primitive Church, the people who first gathered in eastern New York and northern Ohio to make the new covenant, were among the lowly when judged by their material possessions. The Church started rich in things of the spirit, but very poor in the wealth of this world.
Practically all material assets of the Church on which we can depend today, cannot be traced beyond the tithing of President Grant. A few men of wealth from 1830 down to the present time have joined the Church, but most of the converts, foreign and domestic, have answered the description Paul made of the early Christian converts at Corinth: "For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called" (I Cor. 1:26).
We misread the story of Plymouth if we place any motive above those of religion and civil liberty as the driving force back of the Pilgrim migration. Many motives may have been back of our forefathers joining the Church, but paramount among them all were the convictions that they were entering the kingdom of God, that Christ's Church was restored upon the earth. They were primarily in search of spiritual riches, and any other interpretations of our early history are distorted and badly unbalanced.
Year by year, we increase our number of public buildings and our corporate wealth. The youth of the Church and all new converts inherit the fruits of the industry and frugality of the pioneer saints. But to the kingdom seekers of the present we have little to offer of a nonmaterial nature which was not present in the Church as the Founders gathered
ings at Kirtland, Ohio, and Jackson County, Missouri. In that early poverty the elders could say to the investigator: "Repent of your sins, exercise faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and we will baptize you for the remission of your sins and lay hands on your head for the reception of the Holy Ghost." At that early period when they were so poor in this world's goods, the elders could also say: "Through the power of the priesthood which has been restored, you can make covenants with the Lord which are mortality which, if kept faithfully, will be binding in the worlds to come."
Our assurance of immortality is firmly based upon the same evidence which attracted the first converts; our concepts pertaining to the nature of God and the meaning of life are the rich heritage of a not-too-distant past.
In the Nauvoo period when the Church was about fourteen years old, Sidney Rigdon, in reminiscing over the first few months of the Church, said:
I recollect in the year 1830 I met the whole Church of Christ in a little old log house about 20 feet square, near Waterloo, N.Y., and we began to talk about the kingdom of God as if we had the world at our command. We talked with great confidence, and talked big things, although we were not many people.
We had big feelings.
We knew fourteen years ago that the Church would become as large as it is today. We were as big then as we ever shall be. We began to talk like men in authority and power. We looked upon the men of the earth as grasshoppers. (D.H.C. Vol. VI, p. 288.)
The great plans (which we have partly achieved) which the early brothers and sisters made in their rude cabins, the sureness of their position, their faith in the ultimate triumph of their work wit' all centered in spiritual realities which challenged the best within them. The prevailing spirit of that early period was: What can I contribute to this cause? There was neither social prestige nor corporate wealth to attract the investigator until quite recent times.
To repeat: The Church began very poor in the goods of this world but very rich in the treasures of the spirit.
THERE are some churches which verge on being downright anti-intellectual; they oppose, or view with suspicion, all steps forward in science and art. There are many churches which may not be classified as anti-educational but, in the main, they are indifferent towards learning in general. Intellectuality of any kind does not reflect the spirit of their gospel. The thoughtful observer can plainly see that the trend of modern life everywhere is to move farther and farther away from that type of institution.
Everyone acquainted with current Latter-day Saint history knows something about the fine schools which the Church has built, and that most of the Church activities can be placed under the general heading of education. This fact holds true whether one considers the programs outlined for the priesthood quorums and the Relief Society, or those which are planned for the little children and the youth of the Church. Some critics admit that the Church is now very interested in education, but suggest that what was true in the past was
sition by the national trend for universal education as a safeguard to American democracy.
Every Latter-day Saint who has read his early history with care knows that early records to which everyone must refer show that Joseph Smith and many of the early saints had very little formal schooling, but the same records also show that they had great faith in what we now call the educational process, accepting its divine approval and extending its influence beyond the grave. It is a plain fact of history that from the very beginning of the Church, education and salvation have gone hand in hand in the restored gospel plan of exaltation.
To say that Joseph Smith was zealous for education is not a rhetorical phrase written to please the ears of present-day, cultivated Latter-day Saints who take pride in their schools and educational programs; it is a simple unadorned fact. At this point let us recall just one of the many statements of the Lord given to Joseph Smith pertaining to education, at a time when the problems of food, clothing, and shelter were daily, pressing problems to most of the saints: "Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand" (Doc. and Cov. 88:78).
Furthermore, the Prophet's interest in education did not stop with oral utterances; He was an eager student to the hour of his death. He kept the best educated members of the Church close to him; he was not LOOK UNTO THE ROCK 199 afraid of their learning; they were his resource men and counselors. Recently in a class where we were studying the life of the Prophet, a student asked this question with evident surprise: "It states in Josiah Quincy's account of his visit to Nauvoo that the Prophet read from his Hebrew Old Testament in order to make a certain theological point clear; how did he happen to know Hebrew?" The correct answer, of course, is obvious: he learned it the way all men learn Hebrew; he employed a good teacher (Professor Seixas, the best Hebrew scholar of his day) and he sat in a beginner's class and "sweat it out" with the other brethren who were also eager to learn. It is one thing to utter a pulpit exhortation about the necessity of learning; it is quite a different thing to spend your money to employ a teacher and then burn the midnight oil over a Hebrew grammar in addition to doing the laborious, daily-routine, executive business of the Church. The Prophet set a good example before his people in attending classes and in organizing schools, but the most important of all his contributions in this field was the close association which he always made between education and the most sacred teachings and activities of his life. Many times we quote the following in support of education, quite unaware that it is found in the dedicatory prayer given by revelation, uttered by the Prophet at the completion of the Kirtland Temple: And do thou grant, Holy Father, that all those who shall worship in this house may be taught words of wisdom out of the best books, and that they may seek learning even by study, and also by faith...." (Doc. And Gov. 109:14). Apparently, education of the people and temple building were inseparable in the Prophet's mind. In the plans which he proposed for the temple to be built at Far West, one finds that two of its three stories were to be reserved for educational activities. (Comprehensive History of the Church, Vol. 1, p. 440.) The Latter-day Saint student who reads the early history of his Church and does not discover how eager the founders were to raise up a learned generation unto the Lord, have missed an important fact, and a very stimulating one. Emerson said that "Every institution is but the length and shadow of a man." A careful reader of early Church history will learn that the length and shadow of Mormonism is not that of any man limited by the rough life of the American frontier. Rather, it is the length and shadow of the Son of man who placed man's limitations only within the bounds of truth and righteousness.
