THE EASTER GIFT Grace M. Candland Today The darkened earth is filled with guilt and gloom, Swift marching feet and screaming bomb and shell Obscure Christ's resurrection from the tomb. Men race to death through groaning sea and sky, And mourning fills the breaking hearts who tell Of youthful slain, and starving children's cry. The gift of life is but a myth today, Men's carnal minds rush on to living hell. The urns of faith have fallen to decay. Tomorrow Come, stand beside the Easter lily fair And look within its graceful waxen bell, The buried bulb has risen to beauty there. To know that from this darkness and the strife Beyond the reach of tears and sad farewell, There is the promise of immortal life. Eternal message, like a flag unfurled. Bright star of hope, no other can excel The Easter gift unto a dying world.
