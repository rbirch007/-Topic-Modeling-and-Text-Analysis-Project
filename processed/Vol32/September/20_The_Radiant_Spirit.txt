The Radiant Spirit A FANTASY Miranda Snow Walton IN the Beautiful Kingdom lay a broad, white roadway running like a pearled ribbon from the Mountain of the Great Throne to the Silver Sea. Many people, young and old, traveled along the Highway, for it was the Road of Life. This is a tale of two men who journeyed thereon.
Now, there was a legend in the Beautiful Kingdom that when a man had traversed the Highway's length, even unto the shores of the Silver Sea, the Radiant One would take him by the hand, and lead him into an enchanted land, where his eyes would behold things too beautiful for mortal men to look upon. None had ever returned to tell of its wonder, for the law was that a traveler walked that way but once.
It was springtime when Jan and Justin began their pilgrimage. All the earth was made fair and lovely by the silvery sunshine that fell from happy skies. Birds and flowers grew in rich abundance, and birds' celestial music filled the air like a blessed benediction.
Jan was in ecstasy. Nothing, he thought, could be as beautiful as this; no, not even the vision of the Radiant One.
Each day, each hour, brought new delight to his soul, and his feet tarried along the trail until Justin became impatient.
"Hurry," he would call to Jan,
"these are only flowers and trees and birds which we can see every day. Why linger among these common things? Let us not stop until we have reached the Silver Sea."
He would have hastened ahead, but he could not, for it had been decreed that they journey together. He complained bitterly when Jan delayed while they listened to the rustling of moonlit pines.
"Angel whispers, they are," he told Justin, but Justin could only hear the branches scraping one against the other, and he fretted to be on his way, until his heart became filled with worry and resentment.
Summer came, and passed; then autumn and the earth was more beautiful than it had been in the springtime. To Jan, each scarlet leaf became a miracle, each golden tree more exquisite than the last, and where green fields had lain in lazy loveliness, now abundant harvests gave the promise of royal riches to all men. But Justin's impatience waxed more strong.
"The nights are becoming chill," he complained, "it will soon be winter, and it is still a far journey to the Silver Sea."
"Yes, I know the nights are chill," said Jan, "but the stars hang low and close like diamonds upon earth's pure breast, and I would drink of this beauty while I can, for we will pass this way but once." So they tarried until the winter of life was upon them, and their footsteps faltered many times, for their bodies were tired from their long journeying. They knew now that they would soon reach the Silver Sea, and Justin inlaid his companion bitterly.
"See," he said, "you have wasted our strength and time along the way on transient trifles. Our eyes are dim with age. Tell me, how can we now see the Radiant One?"
And Jan replied, "I am glad for the experiences of the springtime, for summer's clouds and showers, for the recompense of the harvest. These things have given me power to understand the immenity of that which is to come."
Then the day came when they stepped beyond the sunset into the Silver Sea. With eager, expectant eyes they looked for the Radiant One, as the legend had told them.
Justin spoke first. "We are too late, or we have missed our way. This is only another sea, like the many we have passed, and I do not
I see a person standing in the sun."
But Jan did not hear, for his ears were filled with the chant of angel choirs, his eyes were filled with the beauty that was too great for mortal man to look upon. His soul stood singing, for it knew the ecstasy of immortality, the glory and the joy of heavenly things, the wonder of eternity.
The Radiant One took him by the hand.
"Only those who have known me as they journeyed along the way of life can see me here. I walk with all men, but there are those who will not see and some who will not hear. Blessed are you, Jan, for you have seen me in the sunrise, and in the sacred silence of a higher noon; have known me when I manifested myself in acts of kindness by fellow travelers. You have felt my
