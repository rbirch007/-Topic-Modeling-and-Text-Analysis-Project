MY KITCHEN WINDOWS Violet Harris Hendrickson Today I planned my kitchen With crisp new window curtains. I fashioned them from bits of Swiss With dots like falling snow, And lest they seem too wintry, I appliqued bright flowers In a saucy row. I shined and polished every pane. To feel the sunlight's golden kiss, And prayed, "Oh, Father, Bless all the world With peace and joy like this!" LESSON DEPARTMENT Theology Church History Lesson 3?The Journey Westward Dr. H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, December 4, 1945 Objective: To trace the march of the saints westward, and to show that physical hardship can be more easily endured by those who are supported by the spirit of the Lord than by those who are without his spirit. WHEN the Lord set his hand to fulfill his promise and gather Israel, far-reaching were the results. Especially was this true in regard to the journey of the Mormon pioneers. To trace the westward march of the Mormon pioneers under the vigorous hand of President Brigham Young makes real the beginning scenes of God's promise to bring again Israel. A few comparisons of the journey of Israel of old with that of its modern counterpart are interesting. Under Moses were a people of one tongue, having the same customs and racial background that living as a nation brings. Brigham Young led a band of people whose roots were deep within no one nation but many, for the gospel call was to all the world. Ancient Israel was fed manna by the hand of the Lord; the pioneers of our day not only carried their own provisions, but, of necessity, had to plant en route for others to reap. It was to a land of milk and honey, of fertile soil and vineyards, that God sent his people in the days of yore; the modern Israelites for the cause of Zion had left homes of comfort to go into a wilderness, a vast terrain, which early trappers doubted could be made successfully to yield any crop. Had not the Lord planted in the hearts of these pioneers a faith in his word, the marvelous work of the latter days could never have been accomplished. Let it not be felt that suffering and pain were always the lot of the saints, though great indeed at times was their anguish. There was always a joy of spirit which blessed their efforts and made even the physical hardships lighter. To know the true heart of these souls is to know the perfect balance in life between material and spiritual values. With threats, day in and day out, from mobocrats and corrupt government officials, the saints learned to hold their peace and live. Page  For them it was the kingdom of God first, with the assurance that all else would be added. Such a spirit made them build the Nauvoo Temple, knowing their joy within its walls was to be only a matter of months. In fact, this beautiful edifice was not dedicated until after the great majority of the saints was on the march, having left to some three hundred persons the satisfaction of presenting to the Lord, in ceremonial prayer, this most stately of structures then to be found upon the upper windings of the Mississippi River. Nor were these people without their music and dancing. It is recorded within the diaries of many that after the ordinances of the day had been performed in the House of the Lord, there was often a period of recreation. To cover, within the allotted words for this lesson, even a hundredth part of the story of the journey from Nauvoo to the valleys of the mountains would demand the most strict editing of the facts. It is hoped, therefore, that while presenting this interesting part of our history, the teacher will bring to the class, whenever possible, the diaries of pioneers, together with any of their personal effects long preserved and cherished from early days: a fancy pair of gloves, a piece of prized silver, an exquisite shawl, a hand-painted dish or other such loved appointments of the cultured home. These things, somehow, found their way into the barrel bottoms, the odd box corners, and, often, an opportune opening in a wagon-bed. Here was a people sensitive. Too, to the fine arts of living even in the midst of hard requirements which schooled the heart to forego the luxuries. It was the spirit of the Lord, day and night, that made possible the arduous journey across the plains. A firm belief in him and his word put courage in the step and faith in the heart. Ever bear in mind this thought to understand fully the zeal with which the saints traveled on each different day with the hope for better things. What are the significant facts of the pioneers' journey westward? In the dead of winter, the first of the saints crossed the Mississippi from Nauvoo to begin the trek. It was Wednesday, the 4th of February, 1846. Two days later ferrying began in earnest. At the same time as this march by land began, there set sail from the New York harbor the S. S. Brooklyn, to carry by sea around Cape Horn and on to San Francisco two hundred and thirty-five members of the Church. Loaded within this vessel was also a good supply of all kinds of farming implements, tools for the carpenter, the blacksmith, and the wheelwright, together with the machinery for two gristmills and a sawmill. In addition, there were books on various subjects, a press with type and enough paper to start the printed word among the saints when they should arrive in their new-found home. Samuel Brannan was given the directions for this undertaking. It was to become a helping hand, extending material aid to the other companies of foot-weary emigrants whose weighted wagons, of necessity, had to load lightly the iron implements so needed to break the valley sod. LESSON DEPARTMENT 567 To those who were to travel by land or sea came the word from President Young: When the time comes to start westward we will continue to gather until Israel is gathered: let there be no feelings about who shall go first; those who go first will lay the foundations for those who shall come after, and none will be neglected in their time (D. H. C. Vol. VIL, P- 575)- Most of the month of February was spent, by those preparing for the journey by wagons, at a camp on Sugar Creek, Iowa, while, day by day, additional families rolled in to swell the number of exiles. Council meetings were held both at the camp and back in Nauvoo to lay plans for caring for the destitute and needy, many of whom had rushed off without proper supplies for the journey. President Young was prompted to give direct instructions to members of the camp as follows: I wish the brethren to stop running to Nauvoo, hunting, fishing, roasting their shins, idling away their time, and fix nose-baskets for their horses, and save their corn, and fix comfortable places for their wives and children to ride, and never borrow without asking leave, and be sure to return what was borrowed, lest your brother be vexed with you and in his anger curse you and then you would be cursed according to the power of the priesthood that brother possesses and evil will come upon you (D. H. C. Vol. VI, p. 586). In this winter outpost much suffering from the cold was endured. Nine infants were born at Sugar Creek during those February days. Dr. Richards recorded in his journal for the 19th: The wind blew steadily from the northwest accompanied by snow which fell to a depth of seven or eight inches, but much thawed as it fell, the storm was unceasing, and the evening was very cold (D. H. C. Vol. VI, p. 593). March of 1846 came in like a lion, and in its extreme cold the camp at Sugar Creek broke up. The journey west began in earnest. All through this month and the month of April which followed, the steady stream of saints pushed over the heavy soil of Iowa with its grassy and rolling lands and deep ravines. By April 24, some one hundred and forty-five miles west of Nauvoo, a camp site was selected and named Garden Grove. Here, within a short period, a thriving village was set upon a clearing. Samuel Bent was named president with Aaron Johnson and David Fullmer as counselors to direct this camp of Israel. Here, many of the saints were to remain, build, and plant for those who were to come after. President Brigham Young saw the need of holding ground while extending ever westward the march to the mountains. By now the great body of the saints had left Nauvoo. May brought the return of spring to the prairies. By the 18th, President Young, in company with Parley P. Pratt and others, found joy in the sights there were on every hand. Elder Pratt writes: One day riding about three or four miles through beautiful prairies, I came suddenly to some round and sloping hills, grassy, and crowned with beautiful groves of timber; while alternate open groves and forests seemed blended in all the beauty and harmony of an English park. While beneath and beyond, on the west, rolled a main branch of the Grand River, with its rich bottoms of alternate forest and prairie. As I approached this lovely scenery, several deer and wolves, being startled at the sight of me, abandoned the place and bounded away till lost from my sight and the groves. Being pleased and excited at the varied beauty before me, I cried out "this is Mount Pisgah" (D. H. C. Vol. VI, p. 607). With joy and the returning hope of the new season of the year, the saints set about building their second camp of major importance in Iowa. Land was fenced and preparations begun for planting and home building. William Huntington, Ezra T. Benson, and Charles C. Rich were chosen to take charge. But for President Young and his party the call was to press on. Over Indian trails and rude bridges they traveled until, on June 14, they arrived at the banks of the muddy Missouri not far from Council Bluffs. They were then in the land of the Potawatomis, a friendly tribe whose chiefs were kind. By the 29th, companies were ferrying across the river. At Council Bluffs, President Young waited to gather in the long train of companies, for he was desirous of giving his people instructions. When some five hundred wagons had wheeled in, their leader addressed the saints assembled. He warned them to be faithful to the Lord and press on. Wicked men would seek to prevent them from doing so, he said, but the saints would find the place to which the Lord would have them go if they would heed his words. Things now seemed right for the journey to continue, the summer months lay ahead and the Platte River with its green banks and shallow eddies lay flattened out some five hundred miles across the level plains of Nebraska. Here was the life-line of shade and drink for the travelers. Then came Wyoming and its Sweetwater leading high into the bracing air of the Rockies. Yes, the journey from here on gave a feeling of uplift and freedom in the heart. Then, too, it was June time of the year. On the closing day of this month came word from Washington. Captain James Allen of the United States Army arrived on the 30th to put an end to dreams. His credentials were for the raising of five hundred men to serve as volunteers in the war with Mexico, recently declared. Strange that a government which would permit thousands of its citizens to be mobbed, now should turn and ask such a people for the flower of their manhood to fight a war. Here was a chance for the saints to turn the other cheek, and this they did courageously. Five hundred men stepped forth within a period of weeks to complete the longest march in the history of the United States infantry. They not only wrote a chapter in the story of Mormon allegiance to the flag, but they were blessed to come through the war unharmed. "Detachments of the battalion who wintered at Pueblo... Together with the main body of the Mississippi Saints entered the Salt Lake Valley, under direction of Captain James Brown," only five days after the arrival of the original company, bringing with them sixty wagons, one hundred head of fine horses and mules, and three hundred head of cattle. LESSON DEPARTMENT 569 How strange the ways of the Lord! Had it been written that upon the arrival of most of the saints in the promised land, domestic animals and modern wains would be there to greet them, would not this have taken a test of faith to believe! But this did not come to pass, however, without sacrifices, for because of the weakened condition of the main body of the saints, with the able-bodied men gone, it became necessary to make preparations for the coming winter. It was a bitter season of snow these exiles spent at Winter Quarters. Many lived in dugouts along the muddy bluffs not far from the Missouri River. At least the saints were consoled in the thought that they had been given permission to remain in that country, and had there found a true friend in Colonel Thomas L. Kane, who importuned the President of the United States in their behalf. Today, as solemn testimony of the bleak winter spent in Nebraska, there stands upon a hill in Florence a Mormon cemetery, within whose graves lie the bodies of many saints and those of infants born but to die of exposure in the cold. With their faces toward the east they await the call of a brighter morn. With the davming of the year 1847 came the voice of the Lord to:... President Brigham Young, at Winter Quarters, giving instructions for the guidance of the camps of Israel on their journeyings to the west. The Saints were to be organized into companies, with captains over hundreds, fifties and tens, as the case had been while journeying across Iowa. These companies were to be presided over by a president and two counselors, under the direction of the Twelve Apostles, who were at the head of all the camps of Israel. The Saints were to enter into a covenant "to keep all the commandments and statutes of the Lord. (Joseph Fielding Smith, Essentials in Church History, p. 433). It was further the command of the Lord that departure for the West should be early in the spring in order to provide for the planting of crops. April 5, 1847, was the day when the march began. On up the north side of the Platte River it went, over the south pass of the Rocky Mountains, past Fort Bridger, west through Echo and East Canyons, then on to Big and Little Mountains which pointed to Emigration Canyon and the Valley of the Great Salt Lake. Stories of the landmarks of the plains, the forts, the Indians, the wild beasts and the travelers met en route, go to make up this eventful trek, until, from a bed in a carriage. President Young raised himself to look over the valley in the heart of the mountains and say, "This is the place, drive on." It was in July, the month commemorating independence, that the saints arrived. Grateful and happy they were to mark their day of freedom in a new land as the 24th, which, singularly enough, counted the exact number of years since the Angel Moroni first brought the restored gospel to the Prophet Joseph Smith. Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggested readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part in the text to discover wherein we must "give heed unto his word." 1. As early as six months after the organization of the Church the Lord, speaking through his prophet Joseph Smith, said the gathering of his elect "into one place upon the face of this land" must take place (Doc. And Gov. 29:8). Why are we as a people in a better position today to under stand the wisdom of the Lord in sounding such a call than were the few saints who were present when the revelation was given in September of 1830? In drawing out the answer to this question have the class reflect upon the world conditions today. These may be listed. Read Doc. and Cov. sections 1, 38, 88, 93 in the Doc. and Cov. Commentary. Found in these verses. Read any section in Doc. and Cov. 33.
Have section 136 of the Doctrine and Covenants read with its introductory paragraph. Pay particular attention to the following parts of the revelation: verses 3, 6, 8, 10, 16, 20, 28, 31, 35, 36, 39. In the light of the lesson have these discussed.
3. What are some of the interesting facts you know of the journey to the Rocky Mountains? Read chapters 37, 38, 39 in Essentials in Church History.
The following questions may be used if needed for further class activity or they may be assigned for home study. What facts of human interest may be gained from the diaries of the pioneers? Read "Through Diaries of Long Ago," Children's Friend, July 1942.
Special Note: Be sure to make full use of other material in the July 1944 issue of Thefor study in connection with the course in Church History.
(Note: On this map an error was made in locating Harmony. The town of Harmony, now known as Oakland, should be located on the Susquehanna River, just south of the state line of New York and Pennsylvania. See Essentials in Church History, map page 47.) Visiting Teachers' Messages Sources of Strength?Charity Lesson 3?Charity Envieth Not Dr. Lowell L. Bennion For Tuesday, December 4, 1945
Objective: To show that the cultivation of the spirit of charity will rid our lives of envy.
ENVY works on the mind much as cancer does on the body. Instead of enriching the mind from without, it destroys it from within. Envy is a product of covetousness; it looks upon and desires that which is not its own, but upon that which belongs to another. Its ways are unholy evil: envy keeps one in misery by focusing his attention on that which he lacks; at the same time, it diverts one's energy from acquiring objects of one's desire in a profitable and legitimate way; and envy
causes one to dislike, and even to hate, the person who possesses that which he desires for himself.
Envy cannot be conquered by a frontal attack, by concentrating on the evil itself. To rid our lives of envy, we must look first for its cause, and second, to some power even greater than envy itself with which to erase it.
Envy has its roots in our own lack. It is an admission that we are not prepared to live a rich, soul-satisfying life. LESSON DEPARTMENT 571 Living the gospel win enable us to overcome the feeling of lack in our lives and rob envy of its nourishment. Alma tells us that, if we will plant the seed of faith (in the word of God) in our hearts, and nourish it with patience until it takes root in us, that by and by we?... Shall pluck the fruit thereof, which is most precious, which is sweet above all that is sweet, and which is white above all that is white, yea, and pure above all that is pure; and ye shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are filled, that ye hunger not, neither shall ye thirst (Alma 32:42 also note verses 27-43). "Charity seeketh not her own." She rejoices in the success of others. She is aware, not of her own needs, but of the needs of others. Hers is the spirit of giving, of helping, of loving. A heart full of charity has no place in it for envy. Literature The Bible in Our Literature Lesson 3?Bible Influences As Revealed in Our Lyric Literature Dr. Howard R. Driggs For Tuesday, December 18, 1945 Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace. Good will toward men. THIS heavenly lyric, voiced by angels over gentle Bethlehem in the long, long ago, touches the heart of our study. Its soulful lines carry a message of divine meaning for wayward humanity. They point the way toward heaven. This inspiring song is sometimes called the first of Christmas carols. Carol singing among human folk, however, did not come until more than a thousand years following that holy night. And yet, it was the inspiration of that beautiful song and the coming of the Christ child it heralded which gave to us the car- (Luke 2:14) ols we love to sing to help keep Christmas a holy day. In a true sense, a carol is a song of praise for a festal occasion. As Christianity was spread among the common folk, their joyousness began to find expression, particularly at Christmas time, in singing praise to the Savior. Lyric lines springing out of their hearts became, with time, charming folk songs; and the best loved of these were passed on through the years. From this rich heritage we get such soul-lifting expressions as the following; It came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old, From angels bending near the earth, to touch their harps of gold; Peace on earth, good will to men; from heav'n's gracious king. The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing. O come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant; O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem; Come and behold him, born the king of angels; O come let us adore him, O come let us adore him, O come let us adore him, Christ the Lord! Some of our gifted writers, catching the spirit of the folk carols, have created lyrics which take place with those time-honored songs. Among these are Luther's "Cradle Hymn" and "Silent Night, Holy Night" by Franz Gruber, known by heart and sung in many tongues. Another that holds our affection for its sweetness and light is "O Little Town of Bethlehem" by Phillips Brooks, inspired on a Christmas Eve spent by him in this town where the Savior was born. Following is the first stanza of that beautiful song: O little town of Bethlehem! How still we see thee lie; Above thy deep and dreamless sleep, The silent stars go by; Yet in thy dark streets shineth The everlasting light; The hopes and fears of all the years Are met in thee tonight. All down the years the story of the Christ child, with the angels and the shepherds, the star and the wise men, has been the inspiration of lyric expression. Countless songs have been and are still being created around this theme. Another sacred theme that has profoundly influenced our lyric literature is the resurrection of the Savior. To a world groping in spiritual darkness, this divine event brought radiant light. With the sublime revelation that man can rise from the tomb into immortal existence, life took on new meaning, more heavenly purpose. For art expression, it was the opening of a new vista, arched by a rainbow of hope for a more glorious future. Lyric lines, expressive of faith in immortality, accepting death as a part of the eternal life plan, as but a portal opening into a larger life, are to be found in many outstanding poems. Following are a few such sincere and helpful expressions: Life is real! Life is earnest! And the grave is not its goal; Dust thou art, to dust returneth. Was not spoken of the soul. ?"Psalm of Life," Longfellow Ah, well for us all some sweet hope lies Deeply buried from human eyes. And in the hereafter angels may Roll the stone from its grave away. ?"Maud Muller," Whittier #? * I stay my haste, I make delays? For what avails this eager pace? I stand amid the eternal ways And what is mine shall know my face. ?"Waiting," John Burroughs * ?# Sunset and evening star, And one clear call for me! And may there be no moaning of the bar, When I put out to sea. But such a tide as moving seems asleep. Too full for sound and foam. When that which drew from out the boundless deep Turns again home. Twilight and evening bell. And after that the dark And may there be no sadness of farewell. When I embark; LESSON DEPARTMENT 573 For though from out our bourne of Time and Place The flood may bear me far, I hope to meet my Pilot face to face When I have crossed the bar. ?"Crossing the Bar," Tennyson Another appealing theme was found in the loving service of the Savior. His living lessons in true charity, tolerance, brotherhood, neighborliness, and other Christian virtues have been a constant inspiration to authors. Illustrations that follow are typical of thousands of lines that echo the divine precepts and example of the Master in making the gospel live among men: She never found fault with you, never implied Your wrong by her right; and yet men at her side Grew nobler, girls purer, as through the whole town The children were gladder that pulled at her gown? ?"My Kate," Elizabeth Barrett Browning *?? It is not just as we take it. This mystical world of ours. Life's field will yield as we make it A harvest of thorns or of flowers. ?"Perseverance," Goethe KY God send us a little home To come back to when we roam. Red firelight and deep chairs. Small white beds upstairs. Homely flowers in brown sod. Overhead thy stars, O God! ?"Prayer for Home," Anonymous If I can stop one heart from breaking, I shall not live in vain; If I can ease one life the aching.... I shall not live in vain. ?"Success," Emily Dickinson I see from my house by the side of the road, By the side of the highway of life. The men who press on with the ardor of hope. The men who are faint with the strife. But I turn not away from their smiles nor their tears? Both parts of an infinite plan; Let me live in a house by the side of the road And be a friend of man. ?"The House by the Side of the Road," Sam Walter Foss All such poetical expressions serve to further the great purpose of the Savior in bringing the gospel to earth. He spent his life doing good among men. Lyrical lines such as these help us to see more clearly the inner meaning of his divine work, and to feel something of the joy of our Father in heaven when we follow in the footsteps of his Only Begotten Son. It was something of this thought that inspired James Whitcomb Riley when he penned in homely dialect the little poem called ?Jim?? a tribute to a self-sacrificing shoemaker. Jim was always giving, always helping and cheering those who came to his shop. Even in his closing days, when an incurable illness was taking his strength, the kindly cobbler had ever a pleasant word to give to others. And after he had passed to his reward, the poet has one of Jim's fellow workers say tenderly: When God made Jim, I bet he didn't do anything else that day But jest set around and feel good. No small contribution to the bringing of the Savior into our daily lives has been made by gifted poets of our own faith. Songs of their creation that we love to sing not only keep us actively helpful, but also lift us closer to a heaven of reality, where the warmth of both father and mother love awaits those who win salvation through a life of righteousness. This appealing truth finds most artistic expression in "O My Father," a lyric prayer by Eliza R. Snow, which ranks among the finest of religious poems. Besides the wealth of carols and hymns, anthems and oratorios linking directly with the Bible, there is a wealth of other lyrics that are in tune with its spirit. Songs of innocent childhood, of nature in all her moods, of home and friends, of pure love, of loyalty and patriotism?all are in consonance with true religion. Lines like these that follow surely lift us a little nearer heaven: My heart leaps up when I behold a rainbow in the sky. ?Wordsworth The little bird sits at his door in the sun A-tilt like a blossom among the leaves. ?Lowell I can hear the robin's warble and the meadowlark's sweet trills All around the dear old homestead lyin' there among the hills. ?Harrison R. Merrill But the air's so appetizin'; and the landscape through the haze Of a crisp and sunny morning of the early autumn days Is a pictur' that no painter has the colorin' to mock? When the frost is on the pumpkin and the fodder's in the shock. ?"When the Frost Is On the Punkin," James Whitcomb Riley It has been a long evening. I have watched A sky of clouds go by. God lent A crown of sunshafts To flash and fall away. I am content. ?Leon Loofbourow Think every morning when the birds peep through The dim, leaf-latticed windows of the grove. How jubilant the happy birds renew Their old melodious madrigals of love! And when you think of this, remember, too, 'Tis always morning somewhere, and above The awakening continents from shore to shore Somewhere the birds arc singing evermore. ?Longfellow I'm hungering in the city for the smell of fragrant timber. For the valleys where the birchbark smoke goes curling through the trees. For the lazy miles of lakeshore, where the blue waves kiss the pebbles, In the land of skyblue water, up beyond the inland seas. ?May Stanley And last, this soul-stirring stanza from a nineteen-year-old American air pilot who gave his life to help preserve our freedom: Up, up the long delirious blue I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace Where never lark, or even eagle flew? And while with silent lifting mind I've trod The high untrespassed sanctity of grace, Put out my hand and touched the face of God. ?John G. Magee, Jr. Discussion and Activities 1.
