His First Teacher Mildred Y. Hunt ONE of the ever-increasing wonders of my world is the capacity of the child mind for receiving impressions. In his quest for learning he is inexhaustible. In the beginning, his questions were very simple and the main problem was framing replies in language that he could understand. Day by day his interest has widened and with it my responsibility, for I must weave the type of fabric which I desire to be the basis of his future education. This is a part of motherhood in which I have always believed, but not until my own child reached this stage did its possibilities rise before me in such limitless proportions. The impressions made now, upon virgin soil, will take root and live to shape the conduct of his entire life. That which concerns me most at this stage is the foundation of religion. I feel certain that the responsibility for this belongs essentially to me, rather than to those who teach him outside of home. Their contribution will help, but mine is the task of building the main structure. Sunday School and Primary lessons will be more beneficial if he has a background of religious knowledge. It is well that repetition does not bore him, for each retelling strengthens his knowledge and widens his understanding. The characters of the Bible are real and interesting. He never tires of hearing about Jesus and all the incidents and happenings that bring out the beauty and purity of his life. Joseph Smith, too, lives for him in all his nobility. Adam, Enoch, and Noah, the stories of Joseph and the enslavement of the children of Israel, and their delivery by Moses are as interesting to him as any characters of fiction. This is the wonderful thing about teaching him, for once the child's interest is gained the teacher's work is easy and pleasurable. Our Church leaders have stressed the importance of early training for children. According to President Grant: The Lord has said that it is our duty to teach our children in their youth. Children are not born with a knowledge of the gospel. Each one must learn and study and gain that knowledge for himself. Brigham Young was very explicit in his direction to mothers: Let mothers commence to teach their children while in their laps; there do you teach them to love the Lord and keep his commandments.... If you, mothers, will live your religion, then in the love and fear of God teach your children constantly and thoroughly in the ways of life and salvation, training them up in the way they should go, and when they are old they will not depart from it. If we do not take the pains to train our children, to teach and " instruct them concerning these revealed truths, the condemnation will be upon us as parents. Page 547 The value of family prayers in training children for religious and spiritual lives cannot be over estimated. Sincerity and humility on the part of the parents seeking the spirit of the Lord in the home is one of the first profound impressions to be made on young minds.
It is easy to let less important tasks crowd out these essential activities. One of the most potent weapons of the adversary is procrastination. Our lives today move at a rapid tempo, but it is more important than ever that we remain calm, and hold fast to the enduring and everlasting principles of the salvation of souls.
for us but also for our children. Not one of the tasks constantly tugging at us is important enough to justify neglect of the great trust which is ours in the training of these little ones.
And so, of the two precious years that remain before I give him over to others to teach, there is no time to waste. In studying for the information which I must have in order to meet this goal, I, too, shall be immeasurably benefited. We shall share a rich and happy experience together which we shall be better able to give to others.
