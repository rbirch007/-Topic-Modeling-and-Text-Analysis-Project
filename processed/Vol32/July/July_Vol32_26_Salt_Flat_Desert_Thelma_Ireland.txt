SALT FLAT DESERT Thelma Ireland In the valley stretch the salt flats Which the purple mountains hug. And the contrast makes the desert Look just like an ermine rug. Lesson I?Christ's Example For Tuesday, October 2, 1945 Objective: To show that Jesus in his own life exemplified true charity, demonstrating that a life of charity is filled with love and is free from self-pity, intolerance, envy, and hate. JESUS said, "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light" (Matthew 11:28-30).
Jesus had seen the yoke upon the oxen, how it aided them in pulling the plow. Thus, he likened himself and his teachings to a yoke which, if taken upon ourselves, would make it easier for us to bear the burden of life. More than anything else this yoke was to be the principle of Christ-like love or charity.
The life of the Master was big with love "as a tree with blossoms in the spring." His charity knew no limits, no bounds, neither height nor depth. It was everything which Paul said of charity?patient, kind, free of envy, unselfish, courteous, sincere, enduring, and unfailing.
Jesus did not discriminate in expressing his charity for men. Only the self-righteous hypocrites came under his condemnation (Matthew 23). To the rest of mankind he gave freely of himself. When his disciples rebuked parents for bothering Jesus with their young children, "he was much displeased." Moreover, he used the occasion to teach a great truth (Mark 10:13-16). So aware was he of the needs of people,
that he was sensitive to the touch of faith by the woman who dared only to feel his garment (Mark 5:24-34). Here again we may contrast the attitude of his less sensitive disciples who wondered that Jesus should discern a single touch in the midst of a crowd. Pharisees and scribes marveled and murmured because there "drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him" (Luke 15:1-2). Out of compassion he fed the weary multitude. (Mark 6) His last prayer to be recorded in full was a petition, not for himself, but for his disciples and all who should believe in him, "that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us. . . ." (John 17:21). As he hung on the cross his final request in behalf of the Roman soldiers who had carried out the orders to crucify him, was, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do," (Luke 23:24).
A life full of charity such as that of Jesus has no room in it for selfpity, intolerance, envy, or hate. It will not be overcome by pain, suffering, and sorrow, for it will always know the joy and spiritual renewal that accompanies love. Truly Jesus' yoke of love and charity is easy, and his burden light to those who take them upon themselves. LESSON DEPARTMENT 437 Literature The Bible in Our Literature Dr. Howard R. Driggs Preview of Lessons for 1945-1946 ONE central purpose motivates this course. Its lessons are intended to help those who make an active study of them to get a clearer, more appreciative understanding of the vital role played by the Bible in the creating of our literature. Each lesson offers an alluring quest with-in this broad and fertile field. Rewards of devoted work will be more intelligent, more recreative reading, with greater skill to select literature really worth reading. From the class viewpoint, these rich returns will come only if the course as an air-pilot might say, is kept "on the beam." Manifestly, in the limited time that can be allotted to the lessons, the main goal must be kept ever clearly in view. Each lesson, it is true, will prove an "open sesame" to treasures of literature; yet the natural temptation to linger too long over the gems, must be resisted by teacher and class member if the larger, spiritual end is to be attained. It is hoped, of course, that individuals and groups will be inspired to carry on beyond the classroom in further uplifting enjoyment of precious literature that is found. Both definiteness and flexibility mark the study plan. Every lesson, a unit in itself, helps to carry forward the central theme. It points the way to discovering how the Bible, in different ways, is woven with artistry into the type of literature with which the lesson deals. At the same time, it opens opportunity to draw freely upon not only time-tested literature but promising literature of the living present, for appropriate selections and quotations to add convincing concreteness to the main message to be impressed.
