THINGS BEAUTIFUL Rose T. Graham These are beautiful things: The peacock's rounded, wide-spread tail, The rainbow trout with shining scale. The armadillo's coat of mail; These are beautiful things. These are beautiful things: A baby in your arms to fold, A big boy quarrelsome and bold, A mother who can wisely mold; These are beautiful things.
