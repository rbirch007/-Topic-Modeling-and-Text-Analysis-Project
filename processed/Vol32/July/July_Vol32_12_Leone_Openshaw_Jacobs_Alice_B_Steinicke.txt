Leone Openshaw Jacobs Alice B. Steinicke President Ensign Stake Relief Society STRENGTH lies not in might, but in righteousness, and righteousness is one of the outstanding qualities of Leone Openshaw Jacobs. A capable and experienced Relief Society worker, she has charm and poise, seasoned with humility, a gracious dignity, sound judgment. And she lives the Golden Rule. Leone was born in Kaysville, Utah, a daughter of Joseph and Elizabeth Raymond Openshaw, staunch Latter-day Saints. Her grandparents on both sides were pioneers for the gospel's sake. Leone attended school in Kaysville and graduated from Davis High School. It was while attending the University of Utah, majoring in education, that she met her future husband, Joseph Jacobs. They were married in the Salt Lake Temple, August 30, 1923. Due to her own inclinations and the fact that her husband is a high school teacher, Leone has continued her interests along educational lines. She and her husband have given generously of their time and talents in the various organizations of the Church wherever they have resided. A wonderful missionary experience came to Leone in July of 1938, when her husband was called to preside over the Palestine-Syrian Mission with headquarters in Beirut, Lebanon.

Here Sister Jacobs was mission mother and received great joy and inspiration from her work with the devoted saints and missionaries. The privilege of living amid the sacred surroundings of the Holy Land instilled in her a lasting appreciation of the gospel and the mission of the Savior. The latter part of 1939, they were called home because of the war, being among the last missionaries to arrive in the United States. Soon after coming home, Leone acted as assistant literature teacher in the South Eighteenth Ward Relief Society. In September 1941, she was called to the Ensign Stake Relief Society Board, under President Lucena R. Card, later becoming second counselor to Sister Card, and still later first counselor to Alice B. Steinicke, president of Ensign Stake Relief Society at the present time. In these positions Leone has proved her love for Relief Society by her devoted service. LEONE OPENSHAW JACOBS Quoting Sister Jacobs' words, "Activity in Relief Society has brought me much joy, a greater testimony of the gospel, and many cherished friendships."
