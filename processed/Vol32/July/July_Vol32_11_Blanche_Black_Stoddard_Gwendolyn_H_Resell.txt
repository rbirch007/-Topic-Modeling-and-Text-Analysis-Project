Her fervent testimony and unwavering love of the gospel thrill young people and old alike. With her buoyant spirit, her talent as a speaker, and an unusual ability to remember names and faces, she has surrounded herself with a host of friends and is loved by all who contact her. Her list of friends includes both sweet-faced old folks and lively adolescents, for she has worked in every auxiliary in the Church. Sister Stoddard, born in St. Anthony, Idaho, the" oldest of seven children, comes from hardy pioneer stock and was reared in a home where love for and devotion to the gospel and service in the Church were taught from babyhood. Her early life was spent in La Grande, Oregon, where she received a fine education in business and banking and where, when only nineteen years of age, she was called upon to act as president of the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association.

Stake representative, and counselor in the stake Relief Society. Her father, Charles J. Black, was a bishop in Oregon for some fourteen years and was then made a counselor to the stake president. Her widowed mother, Mary Ann Steers Black, who still resides in Oregon, has been an ardent worker in the Church throughout her life.

He was a bishop in Oregon for six years prior to the family's move to Salt Lake City. He has always been a lumberman and at present is conducting his own business. He, also, is a zealous Church worker and his co-operation and backing are in a large measure responsible for his maverick's success. Both Brother and Sister Stoddard have always willingly accepted the calls to serve which have come to them in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints never seeking office, but always filling their appointments humbly, prayerfully, and well. They are the parents of four lovely children: Ann, the wife of Captain L. C. Reese, is now stationed at Phoenix, Arizona, with her husband and tiny daughter, Linda; Philip is a corporal with the United States Infantry in Germany; Sue will graduate in June from the East High School where she has been student body secretary; and Judith is a student at the Roosevelt Junior High School.

The friends of the children as well as of the parents love to gather and always find a sincere welcome, a warm friendly feeling, and a wholesome homey time.
Since coming to Salt Lake City thirteen years ago, Sister Stoddard has served on the Wells Stake Sunday School Board, the Bonneville Stake Primary Board, and taught Seminary in the Wells and Le-Grand Wards before becoming superintendent of the Junior Seminary in Bonneville Stake. During the past few months she has been invited to speak at numbers of Fire-side Groups and Gleaner classes on "Temple Marriage," and has succeeded in implanting in the hearts of the young people she has addressed a desire for celestial marriage and its blessings.
Although she has been outstandingly successful in each position as she has filled it, her heart for a number of years has been in Relief Society work. This is evidenced by her record as theology teacher in the Relief Society of the Seventeenth Ward where, for nine years, regardless of other appointments, she did not miss a single theology day. The Relief Society sisters know and love her as a brilliant teacher whose gospel background and pleasing lesson presentation afforded them hours of spiritual enjoyment and uplift.

Under her capable guidance Park Stake Relief Society has taken its place near the top in achievement.
All who know her ability and background are looking forward to outstanding work from her, and praying for our Heavenly Father's choicest blessings upon her in her new calling.
