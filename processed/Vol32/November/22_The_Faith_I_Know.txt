THE FAITH I KNOW Linnie Fisher Robinson I face defeat, yet, in surprise, I find That even now I look to future skies; Before the ruins of my castle walls I sense that hope within me never dies. For I recall the beauty of my dream, The sweetness of each day with work to do, And though my labor netted naught, at last, There is a glory that my cause was true. And there is triumph in pursuit of such. Each memory can soothe my present woe; Moments more favored, that I?ve known, crowd close-This is not doubt?this is the faith I know. LESSON DEPARTMENT Theology Church History Lesson 13?Stakes of Zion Increased Dr. H. Wayne Diiggs For Tuesday, February 5, 1946 Objective: To suggest the firm and sure way the Lord has of extending his purposes in the earth. AS a people, the Latter-day Saints have always closely linked the temporal with the spiritual. To them, faith without works is dead. There can be no true religion unless the widow and the fatherless are visited, the naked clothed, and Church members hold themselves unspotted from the world. This practical wisdom found in the Epistle of James, the Prophet Joseph Smith applied in all his teachings. He always set his followers to work knowing that if they did good, they would be good. On August 2, 1833, only three years after the organization of the Church, the Lord gave a revelation to Joseph Smith which touched upon the practical plans for bringing about the future city of Zion (Doc. And Cov. 97). There was to be work ahead for the saints. In June of that year, labor had started on the Kirtland Temple. Presiding Bishop Edward Partridge shortly before had been sent plans for this. Also he received a blueprint in words of the future beautiful cities of the world. How effectually the cities would combine the aesthetic and functional may be seen by the following: The first city plat was to be one mile square, divided into blocks containing ten acres each, except the middle range of blocks, which were to contain fifteen acres each. All the blocks, except those containing schools and public buildings, were to be divided into half-acre lots, four by twenty rods each. The dwelling houses were to stand twenty-four feet from the street. The plat would accommodate from, eighteen to twenty thousand inhabitants, and they would need twenty-five buildings for schools and public worship. These buildings would be temples, and none would be less than eighty-seven feet by sixty-one. There were to be no barns or stables in the city, but these were to be situated on lands laid off for that purpose, on the north and south sides of the settlement. The farms would be situated east and west of the city, but the tiller of the soil, as well as the mechanic, merchant and others, would live in the city. Page 695 "When this square is thus laid off and supplied, lay off another in the same way," the Prophet wrote, "and so fill up the world in these last days" (ANDREW JENSON, Historical Record, page 635; see Doc and Cov. Commentary, page 751).
What room would there be for slums with their attendant political vice, vice, and crime in such cities? The farmer, the worker, and the professional man here might live in mutual fellowship for the good of all and of society. There, country and city life would be blended and the place of religion and education be one.
But who could plan and build such communities? Certainly not those motivated by selfish interests of worldly minds. These centers of spiritual and social life could only come from a people who were "pure in heart, for this is Zion" (Doc. and Cov. Sec. 97:21). Consider the words of the Lord, that Zion first is a state of mind, before ever it is a city or place upon the earth. God requires the heart as well as the hand. Without a first of these there cannot truly be a second. He has said he will plant the stakes of Zion throughout this land. Stakes in the first meaning of the word are pointed pieces of wood, to be driven into the earth as a mark for support to which may be tied lengthening cords used to hold above a flexible covering, adjustable to the changing conditions and needs of those who seek shelter beneath. In a religious sense, the meaning becomes even more significant. Stakes are territorial units of the land governed by presiding officers of the Priesthood of God, who plant within the marked boundaries the wards and branches of the Church, (which unitedly work for the common good of all the
souls who will be pure in heart). To set, therefore, the stakes of Zion would mean to build up the wards and branches of the Church from the standpoint of helping men to realize material as well as spiritual values. Ward chapels and stake tabernacles have with steadily increasing number been built within the large centers of urban life, as well as upon the rolling rural hills of the farm lands.
President Brigham Young, in realizing the wise and far-reaching effects of the Lord in setting the hearts and hands of his people to work in the cause of redemption, commended upon the Prophet's vision of this great work as follows:
It was a perfect sweep stakes when the Prophet called North and South America Zion. Let us go to and build the temple (i.e., at Nauvoo and then building) with all our might, that we may build up the kingdom when established and her cords lengthened. It is a perfect knock-down argument, some say; but to the old and faithful elder (and I may say member), who cannot if he is humble and diligent, build up the church (REMARKS, B. H., A Comprehensive History of the Church Cent. I, Vol. VI, page 502).
To bring about this sweep of stakes called for sacrifice and unselfish efforts on the part of the people of the Church everywhere. Filled with the zeal of the restored gospel, hundreds of saints found themselves on their way to the tops of the mountains. The country was wide and the stretch of sky distant. There would be room for all in this land God had prepared. As fast as sufficient numbers could gather, they were sent to colonize the fertile valleys in the domain rimmed round with majestic mountains. With each group went the organizing power of the priesthood to lead in the work of salvation:
... Arise and shine forth, said the Lord, that thy light may be a standard for the nations. And that the gathering together of my saints may continue upon her stakes, may be for a defense, and for a refuge from the storm, and from wrath when it shall be poured out without mixture upon the whole earth (Doc. and Cov. 115:5-6).
Books could be filled with the colorful stories that came to pass with the early fulfillment of these words. To relate but a few connected with the conquering of the intermountain region may stimulate the desire of the reader to hunt more such human-interest stories of the settlement of the West.
One cold January in 1878 where the turbulent waters of the Colorado River cut down through the solid rock below Lee's Ferry, a party of saints under the leadership of John W. Young lined the banks of the stream for a crossing into Arizona. Elder Young was on his way to organize the first stake of Zion there. The barrier of these waters called for sober judgment. More than one adventurer had lost his life in the whirling rapids that washed the canyon walls. But, as though by divine providence, the day the group arrived a bridge of solid ice spanned the danger zone. While the grip of winter held, the party could pass. First, the driven cattle were thrown, their legs roped, and then they were dragged sled-like over the slippery surface of the frozen river. Heavy wagons followed, often carrying 2,500 pounds or more. One ox was lost, being dragged by the chain of loaded oxen that followed their way into the sun-striped cactus
water at a wider place in the river where the ice had broken.
The colonizers continued to come several days after Elder Young and his party had made a successful crossing. Some distance above, at Lee's Ferry, Elder Anthony W. Ivins remained to help these saints across. He made the trip by ferry some thirty-two times.
Among the stories of Arizona's colonization is that of the Mormon Battalion and one of its men, Lot Smith. This soldier and elder later became the first stake president in Arizona. As his first counselor he chose Jacob Hamblin, who was known as the "apostle to the Lamanites" and "Leatherstocking of the Southwest." President Brigham Young instructed this understand-ing elder to feed and not fight his Indian brothers. In order to reach and own, Elder Hamblin often was forced to live on pine nuts. One time he killed crows for his food while on a preaching mission. He became known as a true friend to the Indians because they learned he never spoke with a "forked tongue."
As a member of the presidency of the Little Colorado Stake in Arizona, his kindness and understanding did much to make life enjoyable for the saints who lived the United Order in those communities. A bell called the group together night and morning for songs and prayers and often words of counsel from the brethren. Their work was done in common together. The crossing at Lee's Ferry by the handful of Mormon colonizers in 1878 was but a beginning of hundreds of such migrations made by the saints on their way westward and their way into the sun-striped cactus lands of New Mexico; some pressed on across the arid wastes of Nevada; some braved the biting winds and snow of Idaho and Wyoming; and yet others scaled the rugged Rockies eastward into Colorado. The Rocky Mountain prophecy of Joseph Smith given that August day in 1842, while in his hand he held a cool glass of water that suggested. To him the clear streams of the West, was literally being fulfilled. Intrepid Mormon pioneers played a major role in bringing to pass his words, and in first setting the American flag in the majority of the intermountain states (Children's Friend, "The Stakes of Zion? April 1942). Since those early years of establishing the first stakes of Zion, there has been a steady and impressive growth of these ecclesiastical divisions of the Church. Zion has truly touched both shores of the United States, and enlarged her borders to include parts of Canada, Mexico, and an isle of the sea. At the close of the year 1940 there were 133 stakes of Zion, 1,055 wards, 92 independent branches and 24 dependent branches in the stakes. All the European missions were under the direction of local Elders and were carrying on with marked success under the stress and hardships occasioned by the great war. There were in the stakes of Zion 86,432 men and boys holding the Aaronic Priesthood and in the missions 15,547. There were also in the stakes 95,625 men holding the Melchizedek Priesthood and 9,730 in the missions. The proclamation of the Gospel had been made in nearly all parts of the earth and had been brought to the attention of kings, presidents, potentates and rulers. At the close of this year (1940) there were many signs given spoken of by our Lord as presaging his second coming [Essentials in Church History, page 647). Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggested readings given below, have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part of the text to discover wherein we must "give heed unto his word." 1. How literally have the saints taken the words of the Lord, "... Ye shall build up my church in every region" (Doc. And Gov. 42:8)? Make a study of the points of early colonization from Salt Lake Valley. See the map for Church History series found in July 1944 issue of TheAlso study the "Stakes of Zion" pages 679-683, Essentials in Church History. Are there any family names found on this list known to any of your class members? If so, what stories can such a member relate concerning the person or persons named? For additional facts of interest concerning the early years when the saints struggled to build up the stakes of Zion, read chapters 41 and 42, Essentials in Church History. Also see "The Stakes of Zion," in the Children's Friend, issues for February through June 1942. The articles for March and April are especially recommended for the lesson. As one approaches Idaho Falls, an increasing beauty of panorama of mountains and city meets the eye. The fertile Snake River Valley, with its golden fields of wheat, and potato fields browned by the recent frosts, stretches out to the north. The great river of history and romance comes winding its way to the Columbia, and enchanted with this scene of beauty, you find yourself at the gates of the temple....
