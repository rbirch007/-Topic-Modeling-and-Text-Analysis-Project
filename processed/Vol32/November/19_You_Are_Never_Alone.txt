You Are Never Alone Norma Wrathall 
IT was a golden afternoon in late September of the year 1863 that Zina Gleason and her sixteen-year-old daughter Millicent sat on the south porch of the rock house, peeling fall apples for drying. Already the boards, stretched between sawhorses, were filled with fruit, and row it was time for the little girls, Hope, eight years old, and Ruth, six, to clamber up to the flat-roofed shed, and lay the quartered apples in neat rows in the sun.
Zina's dark braids, wound about her head, lent dignity to the calm pallor of her face, and there was serenity even in the sure movements of her strong hands, swiftly at work. Her sweet lips, firm from the discipline of pioneer life, curved only faintly as she smiled and spoke to her daughter.
"Don't lag now, Millie. We've only a few more."
Millicent sighed, and pushed a stray wisp of hair from her warm forehead. "Mama," she said, "won't we ever be through? I feel as if I never wanted to see another apple again. Why do we have to put by so much fruit, anyway?" The freckles stood out on her flushed cheeks.
"You know why, goose. And we're almost through. I'm saving the rest of my sugar for grape jelly. We can be proud of our cellar filled with jars, and of the dried fruits and vegetables in the attic. You've been a real help to me this summer, Millie."
"You can be proud?I'm just tired," sighed the girl, resuming her work. "Mama, how did papa ever manage to get such a large ranch as this?seems like a smaller one would have done, and then we wouldn't have had so much work."
Zina's lips twitched as she answered, for the girls had heard the story time after time, and never seemed to tire of it. "Your father came to this valley as a boy, to herd cattle for one of the ranchers. And his only possession was a fine race horse, a gift from his uncle. He traded this horse for his first five acres of land. Now he owns hundreds of acres, one of the finest cattle ranches in the valley, and you know how proud he is of his horses."
"Yes, especially the pair of bays he drives to Church every Sunday," Millie giggled. "Last Sunday, when Mr. Peterson beat papa driving down Main Street, papa said it was because a gnat flew in Daisy's eye, and put her off her pace for a second."
Zina smiled, remembering the triumphant Mr. Peterson stroking his dark whiskers, while Jacob's reddish moustache bristled in annoyance. Her gray eyes gazed proudly out across the yard, bright with goldenrod, to the fields and pastures beyond where Jacob's cattle grazed?"the land of a thousand springs," the Donner party had called it.
Ruth came scampering from the shed, her sister following, swinging a pan. "Mama, there's a cloud of dust down the road?do you think it's papa?"
ZINA stood up, dumping the rest of her apples into Millie's pan. "We'll stew the rest of these for supper. No, I don't think it's papa. He said he wouldn't be back from town much before dark." She began lowering the water bucket into the built-up well on the porch.
"Maybe it's Indians! Oh, mama, if it is, will you get anything?" Hope began jumping up and down with excitement.
The little girls ran out to the big gate, and in a few minutes came running back just ahead of two squaws. The younger squaw, with a papoose strapped to her back, was unknown to Zina, but she was well acquainted with old "Indian Mary," expert in making woven baskets of native reeds. Hope, suddenly shy, peeped out from behind her mother at the black-eyed papoose, while Zina bargained with the squaws, giving butter, sugar, and some dried fruit in exchange for the mending basket, light and firm in her hands, and smelling faintly of wood smoke.
The usually silent squaws chattered strangely in their own tongue as they went away, and Zina frowned with annoyance as they jabbered and pointed at things about the place. Indians were getting downright brazen nowadays, she considered. Some of them were said to be outlaws and out beggars, and the ranchers' wives had been warned of thieving old Nowans, who came begging and stealing when women and children were alone. But then, you couldn't wonder at it, she thought, as she busied herself getting apples at work. Skull Valley Indians were very poor,
and in bad seasons had hardly enough to eat.
As she worked, she smiled and talked to the baby who lay in the hand-carved cradle which Jacob had made before Millie was born. It was fine to be living in the new two-story rock house, with its two wide porches, convenient well, and cupboards built clear up to the ceiling in the kitchen. The two-room, battle-dotted log cabin of frontier days seemed poor by comparison.
But the baby slept in his cradle, the oil lamps were lighted, and supper dried in the warming oven by the time Jacob returned, laden with parcels. He gave Zina a resounding kiss, causing her pale cheek to color faintly. Jacob was a heavy-set man, his skin ruddy from outdoor life, his tireless energy sparkling in his blue eyes and bristling in his reddish whiskers.
Zina drew back. "Jacob, the children . . ." "Then she saw someone with him.
"I brought Wilmer home with me?got some supper for us?" Jacob was saying, genially.
ZINA welcomed the scout, Wilmer M. Dee, who was dressed in picturesque shirt and trousers trimmed with fringe.
"Mr. Dee, did an Indian make your suit?" asked Ruth, wide-eyed, marveling as he nodded.
It was as they ate the good supper of stewed dried corn, home-cured ham, cottage cheese, and cool milk which Zina kept immoderately fresh in the springhouse, that Jacob made his abrupt announcement. "Guess you'll have to get along without me for a few days, Zin. We're driving out to Lakeside with the cattle early

in the morning. YOU ARE NEVER ALONE 681 Wilmer's going part way to help us get started. We want to get an early start. Peterson's going out, too, with his outfit. He thinks he can beat us with that string of no-good nags of his." He put his hand to his moustache to hide a grin. "Looked to me like he had a pretty good outfit? chuckled Wilmer, "as a matter of fact, Mrs. Gleason, Fm just going as far as the Point of the Mountain." Zina glanced up in surprise. "Out to Lakeside? Isn't this earlier than usual?" She thought that a fleeting glance passed between the two men, and Jacob answered slowly, "We-1-11, no. Not for this season. The Indians say we're going to have an early winter, and so we might as well get the stock settled. It'll mean more than one trip out, best we can do." "Mr. Dee, how did you learn to talk Indian language?" put in Milli-cent, "And what is it they call you, tell us, please?" Mr. Dee's quietly twinkling eyes became sober, and the creases deepened in his lean, deeply tanned cheeks. "It's a story I seldom tell," he began slowly, "because, you see, many people would not believe it? but I'll be glad to tell it to you folks." "I've heard you have a wonderful power over the Lamanites," murmured Zina, unconsciously using the scriptural name. "It came about in this way," began Dee, "as you know, I've had lots of dealings with the Indians, as a guide and scout for many years. But for a long time, I was handicapped by not knowing their language. You know how an Indian talks our language, a few grunts and one or two words." He paused, and somehow even the children had become very quiet in the mellow lamplight. "Well," he continued, "I made it the subject of prayer. Night after night I prayed for the power to understand our red brethren. But nothing happened. Then, one time, I went into the hills with team and wagon for wood. My companion, who was helping me, was a young Indian who knew scarcely a word of English. Finally, it was his turn to sit at the front of the wagon and drive the team while I rested. I dozed off to sleep." Mr. Dee's voice became softly husky as he continued, "It was a wonderful thing. I could hardly believe my own ears. But when I awoke, that young Indian asked me a question and I answered him in his own tongue." They were all quiet for a moment, then Ruth piped up, "But what is it they call you, Mr. Dee?" "Well, the nearest they can come to pronouncing Wilmer M. Dee, is 'Widdem-e-dee." " Everyone smiled, and the talk turned to plans for the morning. As Jacob bade her good-bye before daylight next morning, Zina felt a sense of foreboding. Accustomed to staying alone at the ranch with the children, she felt a strange loneliness, as she stood on the porch and heard the hoofbeats of the horses die away. She shivered when a coyote howled in the distance. Then she turned quickly back to the warm, lighted kitchen. SOCIETY MAGAZINE?NOVEMBER 1945 It was the third day after Jacob had gone that Ike Harrison brought fresh meat from his butcher shop in RELIEF town, as was his custom at certain intervals. The little girls ran out to meet him, gathering bunches of grass for his white mare, which, as far back as they could remember, had been as weary and woebegone as now. IKE was a skinny little man, with a short white goatee which he had to stroke before giving any kind of an answer. Zina selected the meat she wanted from his canvas-topped wagon, while Ike stood shooing away the swarm of flies which always gathered, though the meat was clean enough under layers of heavy paper and cool leaves. It was after he had eaten his customary piece of pie that he asked, "Heard about the Indian trouble, ma'am?" Zina raised her eyebrows. "Indian trouble? That sounds like frontier days. Are you sure, Ike?" Ike stroked his goatee thoughtfully. 'Tep. Seems there's been a renegade band come in?been rus-tlin' cattle from the ranches?some trouble maker's stirred them up with talk about the white man stealing the Indians' range. Guess that's why your husband and Peterson have taken their cattle out to Lakeside already. Better be careful out here all alone. Well, I've got to be on my way. Good day, and thank ye kindly, ma'am." Zina frowned thoughtfully as she watched him drive away, slapping at the indifferent old mare with the harness lines. She hardly believed his story; and yet, why had Jacob and Mr. Dee looked at each other in that odd way when she asked if it was early in the season for Lakeside? And suddenly, she remembered the strange behavior of the two squaws. Had they known of trouble afoot? Then she shook herself. Surely there was nothing to fear. That night the baby had croup, and Zina trailed wearily up and down stairs getting water hot for steam, and warming flannels. At last she lay down beside him on her bed, and was almost immediately asleep herself. It was still dark when something wakened her. She leaned up on her elbow and listened, but the house was quiet to her straining ears, with only the crowing of an early rooster breaking the deep silence. She lay down again, and was just beginning to doze, when she jerked suddenly awake. Her heart hammered in her ears. Was that a sound from the kitchen? She remembered that she had left the outside door unbolted when she had gone to the well for water. It was several moments before she could put her feet to the cold floor, slip into her flannel wrapper, and creep cautiously downstairs. CAREFULLY, she pushed open the stair door, and peered into the. Kitchen. There, in the half light, she saw an Indian bending over her sugar can, his black hair stringing about his neck, and his body bare above the waist. She exerted all her power to keep from screaming, and the suppressed sound seemed to swell and throb in her throat. Above her panic, words began to form in her mind?there's nothing to be afraid of?it looks like old Novaris?and he's stealing my sugar. YOU ARE NEVER ALONE 683 The sound of scraping on the bottom of the can enraged her-the sugar, saved carefully for the grape jelly! She put out her hand and encountered the long buggy whip with which Jacob urged his bays to even faster trotting. Seizing it, she pushed open the door. "Novaris, get out of my sugar!" she called, brandishing the whip. Then her knees turned to water as she saw the startled, evil face of a strange Indian! One thought was uppermost in her whirling brain-to get him out of the house. "Get out?get out?get out of here?" she heard her voice loud above the hammering of her heart. She wondered afterward just what caused the Indian to turn and run from the kitchen, leaving the sugar in a thin white trail across the floor. She slammed the door after him, but all at once, her arms were so weak she could hardly lift the heavy bolt into position. At last the door was fast, and she could sink to a chair, covering her face with her hands. "Mama, what's the matter?" Millie's warm young hand on her shoulder calmed Zina's trembling.. "Nothing?nothing?just an old Indian stealing my sugar?" she tried to sound matter-of-fact, "but sh?don't waken the children?" With shaking hands, Zina began winding the dark braids about her head. Millicent had gone to the window. She gasped, "Mama. Look. Come here ?quick?" Never in all her life was Zina able to forget the sight which met her eyes, and long afterward, she would waken in the night and grow cold thinking of it. In the gray dawn light, she could see the dark line of Indians on horseback threading their way quietly down the drive-lane, and toward the lower pasture, where the remaining cattle were kept. "Mama-what'll we do?" Milli-cent's terrified whisper was loud in the silent room. Zina put her arm around her daughter. Her mind whirled with remembered stories of Indian atrocities, of burned homes, stolen livestock, even?but she dared not finish the thought. ? "They've come to steal the stock ?maybe the rest of the cattle and horses?" "Mama, mama! They might burn down the house. They might take us and "Sh?sh?We'll think of something?we'd better dress. But don't make a light?it might attract their attention toward the house. Oh, if only the children will stay asleep?" Trembling, hurrying, they dressed, glancing fearfully out the window at the Indians, now gathered in a group in the lower yard, their dark backs and brightly-colored feathered headdresses plainly visible in the increasing light. Zina spoke softly, drawing her daughter down beside her. "Do you remember what Brigham Young has taught the people??'In all your troubles, remember that you are never alone?the Lord will hear you if you ask him earnestly.' Kneel with me, Millicent?Dear Father in heaven, please give me strength in this hour of need, and please, please, send us deliverance?" AS they rose from their knees, there was a terrific shout from the yard, and the sound of milling hoofs. Then, above it, came the thin wail of the baby from upstairs, and the two frightened little girls came running to find their mother. In the confusion, trying to quiet their crying, Zina momentarily forgot her own fear. Presently, she held up her hand. "Listen?the noise in the yard has stopped?" "Mama! Do you think the Indians have gone?" "Well, if they have, they've probably-" There was a sudden loud knock at the door. Zina's heart came up into her mouth, and the baby puckered up his face to cry again at the expression on his mother's face. Drawing a deep breath, Zina opened her mouth to call out, but no sound came. There was another terrific knock, and then a voice, "Hello?you all right in there, Mrs. Gleason?" "Oh, thank Heaven-Mr. Dee-" Somehow, her fingers fumbling weakly, she unbolted the door, but not until he came in and helped her to a chair did she realize that tears were running down her cheeks. The children, who had been staring in stupefaction, suddenly set up a clamor. "Where's the Indians, Widdem-e-dee? Did you drive 'em away?? Where's papa?" He held up his hand, "One at a time, now. I came in from the Point of the Mountain day before yesterday, and heard the mutterings around town about Indian troubles. Of course, Mrs. Gleason, we knew there was something wrong when we started the cattle out so early in the season, but never did we think anything like this would happen. Well, I was talking to old Ike Harrison in the butcher shop, about you being out here alone?early this morning, just before daylight. I took a notion to ride out here. Good thing I did." "But the Indians? Did you?" asked Zina. I've?been out there talking to them. As you know, I never carry a gun; it's the best way. They've agreed to wait here until the ranchers return. I think it can all be settled. We've sent a rider out to tell them to hurry in from Lakeside." That evening, after supper, as Jacob relaxed with a child on each knee, he said, "Well, we made it-thanks to Dee. He certainly does know how to handle Indians?and incidentally?" he stroked his moustache to hide a grin, "we got in just a shade ahead of Peterson's outfit." Then his face became sober. "But your mother's a brave woman, staying out here, facing danger alone with you children." Zina looked up from her work. Her gray eyes met his steadily, and the firm lips curved only faintly to smile. Slowly, she shook her head. "No, Jacob. Never alone," she murmured. Wilt thou, our Heavenly Father, let thy presence be felt here always, that all who assemble here may realize that they are thy guests and that this is thy house. (Idaho Falls Temple Dedicatory Prayer) And For Eternity Olive Woolley Burt CHAPTER VI SYNOPSIS Delsa Marriott, jilted by Hugh Temple, decides to "make a play" for Alec Windsor, a marine on furlough. Jeff Holden, principal of the school where Delsa teaches, is interested in Delsa, but she feels that she can save her face better by letting her friends think she has fallen in love with Alec, and has thrown Hugh over for the new attraction. DELSA'S father got out the pickup truck to take them to the wedding because they had so much "truck," as he called it. Mrs. Marriott had made two giant freezers of ice cream, for no party was complete without some of this famous confection of hers. Aunt Martha had a huge chocolate cake. Delsa said, 'I'll walk over and meet you there." So they drove off with a clatter. Delsa tossed a shawl over her curls and went through the early dusk toward the hall. This was to be a real party, as Mrs. Lewis had planned, reminiscent of the parties they had when she was a girl. Lina's friends would serve while the older women took care of things in the kitchen. Later the girls would slip off home to change to their dancing frocks, while the men cleared the room. Delsa, of course, had plenty to do, so she was going over early. But others were there ahead of her. The men were putting planks on saw-horses to make long tables in the amusement hall. The women hovered about, white cloths in their hands, hurrying the men on. As soon as a table was set up, the cloth was laid and plates placed. Delsa smiled. It was a huge undertaking, but the women did not seem aware of that fact as they moved about laughing and talking. But Delsa noticed that there was a big difference between this and the last big party. Now there were no young fellows making a noise, teasing the girls, and doing a big share of the work. The older men sweated as they tugged in the planks, where before, the boys had done this job with a laugh. Delsa missed Millie, who had been her friend ever since they were children. But she knew that Millie and Alec had gone to the city with Jim and Lina and their parents, and that they would not be back until just in time for the dinner. Jeff Holden was there, with a crew of eighth grade and high school boys trying to take over the jobs their big brothers normally had. They were laughing and joking with the teen-age girls, and Delsa suddenly felt old as she watched them. She shook her head a little sadly and went out into the kitchen. They had all grown older, skipped a period in their growth, it seemed. Everything was ready by the time the newly married couple and their parents arrived. After everyone had shaken hands with them and kissed Page  them and wished them happiness, they all went into the long hall and sat down at the laden tables. There was a great deal of merriment during the meal?a few short speeches and toasts and a lot of wisecracking. Delsa, moving between kitchen and dining room, keeping her eyes on the girls who were serving, seeing that everything went smoothly, found little time to join in the repartee. But she did stop at the head table, where the bridal couple and their families and Alec Windsor sat, and watched them cut the towering wedding cake. THERE was an empty chair next to Alec and he said to Delsa, "This is your place, Delsa. Why don't you make use of it?" "Yes, Delsa," Millie cried, "sit here with us. You'll have to eat, you know, and I had them save this place for you." Delsa shook her head. "I like my job as overseer," she laughed, "and I get a bigger share eating in the kitchen." But Delsa was tired when at last the meal was over, and she was glad that she had earned the respite afforded by having to go home to change to her dancing dress. The Grayson girls, who lived a mile further up the road, offered to take her in their car as they slipped home for the same purpose, and Delsa gratefully accepted the lift. This would give her time to bathe and maybe lie down for fifteen minutes before going back to the dance. After her bath, though, she felt fresh and gay. She could hear the music coming from the dance hall and she found that she was im- patient to get, back there to dance with Alec. She was waiting for the Graysons when they stopped to pick her up again. The dance was in full swing when they entered the hall. The music set Delsa's nerves tingling, her feet beating time. She loved to dance, and Alec had promised to dance with her. She hoped he would see that she was there and would hurry to her. Just then he swung past her, dancing with Helen Ball, and seeing Delsa, he smiled and held up his hand in a quick gesture of greeting. As soon as that dance was over, he came across the hall to her, his steps and look eager. DELSA stepped out on the floor with him?felt his strong young arms about her, smelled the rough woolen fabric of his blouse, saw the band of campaign ribbons, even with her eyes, and she thought, why couldn't this be Hugh? Her arms tightened instinctively, and Alec's dark head bent just a little closer to her golden curls. They danced beautifully together, moving through the crowd with instinctive ease, so that it was almost as if they were alone on the shining dance floor. "You look like an angel," Alec whispered, "the kind of angel a fellow dreams about when he's alone in the jungle with danger all around him. The kind of angel that can make heaven become real with just a smile." Delsa laughed up at him. AND FOR ETERNITY "What a line!" she said. But the illusion that it was Hugh who was holding her close this way had been shattered. 687 Delsa sighed a little, and drew back, almost imperceptibly. Alec noticed it, however, and he said gently, "Don't be offended, Delsa. I mean what I say. But I won't talk any more," and he tried to draw her closer again, as she had been before. Delsa was sorry that she had betrayed her reactions so plainly, and to make up for it, she let him hold her close, and tried to forget that this was Alec Windsor, strange marine, with whom she was dancing. When Alec took her to her place again, he didn't leave her, but sat down beside her and watched the other dancers. He told her of the trip to Salt Lake that day, the things he had done, the sights he had seen. When the music started again he said, "May I have another dance, Delsa? Please? It's been a long time since I have enjoyed dancing so much?and it will have to last me for a long time when I go back." So Delsa danced with him again and again. It was wonderfully exhilarating, and she felt her senses tingling with excitement. Then she saw that others were looking at her, watching them together, and she grew a little uneasy. She wondered whether Millie was offended, what Jim was thinking. She wished someone would rescue her, and she began looking about for Jeff Holden. If she could catch his eye-As if in answer to her secret wish, Jeff came up to them after that dance. Delsa hadn't seen him since the dinner, but he had evidently been around somewhere in the crowd. Now he smiled down at her and asked in a cool, matter-of-fact voice, "Isn't this our dance, Delsa?" ALEC said, "I guess I will have to share her, but I hate to. She's the most wonderful dancer I?ve ever found." Jeff laughed good naturedly. "That's what we all think," he said, and led her out onto the floor. Delsa had danced with Jeff Holden hundreds of times. He was a good dancer and she had always enjoyed her dances with him. But as soon as he put his arms about her tonight, she sensed that there was a difference. She prodded her mind, wondering what that difference was. It wasn't Jeff's suit. The neatly pressed gray was as familiar to her as her own father's. It wasn't the way he held her, which was just the same as always, gently, tenderly?as if she were something precious, but familiar. Perhaps that was it, the very familiarity of Jeff's presence after the exciting strangeness of Alec Windsor's. At any rate, Delsa smiled to herself. She was relaxed and at peace?scarcely conscious that she was dancing at all. Jeff wasn't quite so tall as Alec, and his lips came just above her head. He had only to bend his head a little to bring his cheek against her hair, his lips close to her ear. He was bending his head now, and suddenly* Delsa was aware of an urgency that made Jeff's usually quiet voice vibrant. "So Windsor likes to dance with you," he said softly. Delsa shook her head. "He's lonely, Jeff. I feel sorry for him." Jeff's arms tightened, ever so slightly and he whispered, "Delsa, darling! Darling!" DELSA remembered then that Jeff was lonely, too. He had lost his love, just as she had lost hers. He was holding her now, thinking of Lucy, imagining she was Lucy, just as she had thought of Hugh when she had danced with Alec. She felt tears along her lashes and she thought, what a mess it all is? all of us wanting something we haven't got?something we can't have! She wished she could comfort Jeff, but she didn't know what to say. They finished the dance in silence, but Delsa was suddenly weary of the party. She didn't want to dance with Alec again?to feel the excitement racing in her veins after this realization of her own and of Jeff's utter loneliness. And she didn't want to dance again with Jeff?to feel his lips against her hair and to know that he held her close, dreaming of someone else. She turned to him as they walked across the floor. ?I'm going home, Jeff. Take me to Dad and Mother, please." But her father and mother had already left the hall. Jeff said, "Wait here, Delsa. I'll get your coat." Delsa sat down on the bench that ran around the wall and looked at the dancers. They were still merry and noisy and she couldn't imagine why she was So tired, so utterly worn out. Jeff came back with her coat and held it while she slipped her arms into the sleeves. Then he took hold of one arm, turned Delsa gently toward the door, and walked out with her. "Don't you leave, too, Jeff," she remonstrated. "It's just a few steps. And thanks." But Jeff didn't let go of her arm. He walked along beside her, holding to her. "I've got to talk to you, Delsa," he said quietly. "I'm sorry, but it's got to be done. Tm in love with you, Delsa, deeply and truly in love with you, and I can't help showing it. Heaven knows I don't mean to. I know you don't like it?I can see you flinch, actually, and withdraw from me every time I come a little too close. You're thinking of Hugh Temple?and you're thinking that I'm pretty low to step in and try to take you away from Hugh when he's off fighting and unable to protect what is his. But I'm not trying to take you away from Hugh?I'm not going to take you away. I just want to explain so that you won't think too little of me." He stopped, as if at an end, and Delsa walked along slowly, wondering whether she should tell him about Hugh. It would be such a relief to tell someone. Jeff would understand; he would help her cover up the way Hugh had deserted her. JEFF went on, almost desperately, "I can't help loving you, Delsa. I've tried to help it and I can't. Since you've been coming in to look after the children, what was just deep affection has grown into ardent love. But don't worry, darling, please. Now that you know, maybe you won't mind? maybe you'll overlook-" AND FOR ETERNITY 689 Delsa turned to him and laid her hand on his arm. "Jeff," she whispered, softly, and before either of them knew what was happening Jeff had her in his arms, holding her close, his cheek pressed deeply against the soft luster of her hair. "Darling! Darling! Darling!" he whispered, but he didn't raise her face to his, nor try to kiss her. Delsa stood quiescent in the circle of Jeff's arms. She wanted to put her arms around him, to lift her face to his lips, to say, Jeff I?m lonely ?and I am alone. Love me, Jeff; heal the wound Hugh has made." But she couldn't do that. Up to this minute Jeff and all her world had thought she was betrothed to Hugh. How could she say suddenly, 'It's all right? I've just been keeping it a secret, but Hugh and I are no longer engaged. Hugh wants to marry someone else." If Jeff wouldn't be shocked out of his love for her, he would at least be doubtful of her honesty. He would not be able to comprehend her silence, her deviousness. At last, Jeff's arms dropped from around her and he stood back, silent and contrite. "You're lonely, Jeff," Delsa said miserably, "and I'm lonely. And Fm to blame. Coming to the house, being with the children, I've reminded you?" Somehow Delsa's lips wouldn't go on. She was suffering at the thought that she was merely a reminder of his dead wife. JEFF shook his head slowly. "No, Delsa," he said. "Let's not fool ourselves. I am lonely, lonelier now than I have ever been. But you do not remind me of anyone or anything. You are you, Delsa, and I love you?not because of a memory, but because of a dream of what might some, day be." They were at her gate now, and Delsa said soberly, "I am lonely, too, Jeff. I am so lonely that I would find it easy to take comfort in your arms. But I won't do it. You're too good for that, Jeff?you're too good for what I could offer you. Let's forget what you have said and be good friends, just as we were." He said, "I can't forget, but I will let you." "Maybe I'd better stop coming into your house so freely as I have done-" "And make the babies suffer for my clumsiness? No, Delsa, come, please. I'll keep out of your way." He laughed a little bitterly. "Go in; darling. Go to bed and dream of Hugh and when you awaken in the morning, think of this as part of a dream?a dream fostered by the warm spring breeze and the smell of growing things and the madness that comes with the awakening of the earth." She went up the walk and onto the porch. At the door she turned ahd Jeff was still standing there in the moonlight, watching her. She shut the door softly, and was glad that she was indoors and out of the reach of the spring night. (To he continued)
