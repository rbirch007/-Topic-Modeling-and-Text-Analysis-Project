AUTUMN Beatrice Knowlton Ekman Wearing her golden shoes, her flaming shawl And russet gown, Fleet-footed autumn glides through field and town And lone birds call.   From veils of haze, soft purple shadows fall On pastures brown. Where milkweed pods, with fluffed white down, Are prodigal. A hawk hangs motionless upon the sky Above the lane. Where wheel-worn dust, thirsting for drops of rain. Is sifted dry. Hedged farm land spreads a checkered counterpane Of flaxen dye. Where barren fields of furrowed stubble lie.... Winnowed of grain.
