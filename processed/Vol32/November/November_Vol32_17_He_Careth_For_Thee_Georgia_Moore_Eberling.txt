HE CARETH FOR THEE Georgia Moore Eberling On the topmost branch of our bare oak tree A lone brown leaf clings stubbornly. (It is long past time for the leaves to go,) When the brisk fall winds began to blow They put on beautiful golds and reds. Bound crimson ribbons about their heads And sailed aloft, like the butterfly, They all found wings to bear them high. Most of the leaves smiled up at the sun Glad that their summer's work was done, And whispering groups flew far away In the shining hues of their new array. In late November they all have flown Save the leaf that lingered, it's all alone, It will nevermore dance to the lilt of the breeze For winter has come, and all the trees Have wrapped themselves in a winding-sheet Of glittering snow and icy sleet. While the little leaf so full of fear Is ugly and withered, lonely and sere.
