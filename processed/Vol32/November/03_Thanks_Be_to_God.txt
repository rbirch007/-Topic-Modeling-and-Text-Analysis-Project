Thanks Be to God Christie Lund Coles O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth forever. Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy (Psalms 107:1-2). RECENTLY, I stood with hundreds of others at a service marking the end of war. Against a sky tinted with the last debate shades of sunset, with one star glistening like a symbol of hope above a back-drop of majestic mountains, I saw the American flag hoisted high upon a flagpole. I watched it flutter... Clean and bright and beautiful beyond utterance above me. I heard the band play "The Star Spangled Banner," and I felt a thrill throughout my entire being. I felt pride and gratitude and humility. I thought of free men all over the world who were witnessing a similar scene and feeling hope reborn within them. I thought how indescribably horrible it must have been for our boys to see that beautiful flag lowered to the dust while an enemy flag took its place. I thought of the prophetic words, '1 shall return," and their triumphant fulfillment. Then I thought of the boys who had given their lives. Some of them I had known since they were small boys with great dreams in their eyes, with great promise in the future. And even as my heart ached for them and for their parents and wives and sweethearts, I felt that could they see the flag as I saw it now, could they hear the band playing, they would feel that it had not been in vain. Most of all, I thought that never should a people have been more humble, more prayerful, more grateful than the people of America should be today. Never should we have felt more to bend the knee and bow the head in thanks and praise, than in this hour of victory and peace. For the terror of the past years is ended, the guns of war have ceased, men are turning again to their plowshares and their normal pursuits. We stand a free people, we stand still a nation victorious, a light unto the whole world, a beacon to peace and good-will. Thanks be to God. Yes, we have done great things, we have preserved liberty as a hope for all the oppressed and downtrodden people everywhere, we have proven that right is more powerful than might. We have come a 'heartthrob nearer to the end of wars.' Surely, no one can doubt the destiny, the supreme power, that has seen us through our dark days. Surely, no one can be too proud, too ungrateful, to kneel and give thanks for the preservation of his home and his God-given rights of freedom and justice, as well as for the gift of life for loved ones, for the future that lies ahead, even as the Pilgrim fathers before us offered thanks for their crops, for their preservation, for the land that had been a refuge. Page  Actually, we are not so different today. After their waiting and anxiety, after their travail and fear, they saw their crops ripen to abundance, saw the fruition of their hopes. They knew that God had seen fit to bless them. For, with all our scientific knowledge, with all our physical and mental accomplishments, how helpless we are, really, with all our learning, how frightened and alone in the presence of death or illness or the unloosed elements. How in need of the humble faith that looks upward and trusts, and gives thanks. Yes, giving thanks is an integral part of prayer. Christ thanked his Father in heaven for manifest blessings. He walked among men with implicit and utter trust. What father could turn a deaf ear to this? And what child is not better and worthier for having the grace of gratitude, for gratefully saying "Thank you," for a favor requested or granted. Many thinkers believe the secret of the miracles Christ was able to perform was his unerring trust in the Eternal Father. He gave praise and thanks, and he had implicit faith; he never for a moment doubted the power of God to do that which was asked in sincerity and tri4st. A person without gratitude is like a tree that is barren of fruit, that receives' bounteously, yet lacks the grace to give of itself in return. There were miracles in this war, many of them; there were strong men who had boasted of their unbelief brought to their knees when they were overcome by adversity beyond human help. We all know of those shipwrecked, thirsting and hungering men who literally saw manna come out of heaven, who saw the sky respond to their need of water when they could bear their thirst no longer. We all know of those miraculously saved in fox-holes, in the air, on the sea. These men were forced to their knees in humility, they came back different men, men purified by prayer and by thanksgiving. We, as individuals, as a nation, as a world, need the purification of these two things: prayer and thanksgiving. So, let us lift up our hearts, let us humble our spirits and be contrite and prayerful, let us thank our Father in heaven that we have been preserved, that we have been given another chance to make a good and a godly world, to find lasting peace, to do away with want and prejudice of race or creed, to live as brothers in the beautiful and bounteous world he has given us. In this time of rich harvest, this time of reunion, of happy homecoming, this time of serious meditation on man's dependence on a higher power, this time of gratefulness for a belief in a life after death, of immortality and eternal progression for those who have so nobly given their lives, let us humbly say. Thanks be to God. Thanks... Be... To God! Be
