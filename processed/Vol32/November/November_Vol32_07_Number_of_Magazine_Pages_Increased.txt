NUMBER OF MAGAZINE PAGES INCREASED Beginning with this issue, November 1945, eight more pages are being added to ThePaper restrictions, imposed by wartime scarcities, have now been lifted, making it possible for the Magazine to again be published in a larger size. We are indeed happy to take advantage of this opportunity for increasing the scope of our service. It is our hope that the Magazine will be of greater value to the Relief Society organizations in promoting their work, and that the increased variety of the table of contents will appeal to the individual readers. Our purpose will be to provide, so far as possible, practical, cultural, and literary features that will aid in the development of the Latter-day Saint ideal of womanhood.
