THEIR TRYSTING PLACE Winnifred M. Tibbs (Ninety Years Old) The day was done, the sun had gone to rest, And in its place bright stars appeared To light the way. Then o'er the eastern hill The moon arose and spread her silvery light On hill and vale and set a magic spell. Can it be fancy that I see a small, old-fashioned gate, And leaning on the bar a form that waits As if to meet some dear one at the gate? It was not a maiden fair, as first I thought; Her hair was snowy white, her form was bent, And from her lips and cheek the bloom of youth was spent, And in its place a look of faith and sweet content. It seemed as if she did commune with someone near. I listened, and this is what she said: "This is our trysting place. It was here we met And pledged our troth to walk life's path together And be true whatever betide, in fair or stormy weather." And then she paused and whispered low, Yes, dear, I understand. Our Father called you home. And I was left to finish tasks we both began; And still I wait to comfort children dear; But when my task is done. Til meet you here. Together we will kneel at Father's feet and plead for grace." And while they thus communed, a cloud passed o'er the moon. And in the mist they disappeared, and I awoke and found It was a dream. No stars, no moon, no gate, not even a form. And yet within my heart I know it was their trysting place. Their meeting in the twilight's magic hour. FRO! Blanche B.
