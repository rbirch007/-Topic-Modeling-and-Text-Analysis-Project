Dinner at Nora's Martha. Robeson Wiight BUT I'm not taking no for an answer,  Maddy  Nora said over the phone. "Ross and I have planned on this Thanksgiving dinner with you and Bruce as usual, and we have the turkey and all the trimmings ready to cook."  I told you I was sorry." Madeline couldn't help it if her voice was listless. Tt isn't any use." Nora made no attempt this time to be diplomatic. "Maddy Pearson, I'm your oldest, and I think your best friend. You're being selfish. Your staying home and refusing to eat isn't helping Tommy any. He wouldn't want you to be that way. And what about Bruce? He might enjoy coming." Madeline closed her brown eyes for a moment and shuddered. "You couldn't possibly understand, Nora," she said wearily, patiently, "I couldn't stand it all of that food on the table. The smell of it... When..." "I understand more than you think," Nora Blake said bluntly, "And I'm still expecting you and Bruce over here for dinner tomorrow." For a second Madeline wanted to scream at her. But she didn't. She hadn't been able to cry since word had come of Tommy's death. She'd tried it. There was pain, tightness, despair. Nora didn't know all of that, and there was no use trying to explain it to her. Instead, she said, "All right, Nora, we'll come. But don't expect me to eat anything. M-my stomach couldn't take it." "Bring your bottle of milk along, then," Nora ordered, "but I want you to be over here tomorrow with Bruce, or or I'll never speak to you again as long as we live," she finished quickly, and hung up. Madeline gasped and placed the receiver on the hook. As long as we live, she thought, as she turned from the phone. That didn't mean a thing. There's nothing to live for now... With Tommy gone.... Bruce was watching her from his easy chair by the radio. Tommy's tragic death didn't seem to affect him as much as it had her. He went about his business with the same cheerfulness as before. His gray eyes were a little less twinkling and his hair had threads of silver, but he seemed the same. Of course, no one could understand how a mother would feel. "That Nora again?" Bruce asked. Madeline nodded and pushed back a strand of brown hair. "She seems to have lost well, all sensitivity of feeling. You'd think she'd try to understand how I feel." Bruce shook his head slowly. "But she's right, you know. And we've had Thanksgiving dinner with her and Ross for twenty years... Since the first year their Jim and our Tommy were born." Madeline winced and her lips curled themselves in a grimace. "You, too?" How could he know the pain inside her heart... Almost unbearable at times? "All people Page  think about is eating... Eating... Filling themselves with rich food..." Bruce got up and began to pace back and forth in the room. "You ve got to face this thing out, Maddy/' he said kindly, "Going without food won't bring Tommy back. Going without food wouldn't have helped him when he was alive in that prison camp, slowly starving to death." She turned on him, fists clenched, mouth contorted. '1 was the first to give him food. I taught him how to eat with a spoon then a fork-how to feed himself. But I couldn't help in that prison camp. I wouldn't have minded so much his dying in battle... That's a kinder way... A quicker way. I see him... Every night... Lying there... Suffering... And thinking of the good food he always had at home. He loved my cooking... I know he must have thought of that... To the very end!" B RUCE stopped pacing and the look he gave her was strange. Almost as if he felt that she was to blame for everything that had happened. "Other mothers have lost their sons, Maddy." She forced herself to look at him intently. "Other mothers? Did their sons die in prison camps?" She caught her breath in a dry sob. Bruce came over and took her hands. "Everything will iron itself out, Maddy, if you'll try. Thanks for telling Nora you'd go. It won't be so bad. We have to learn to start mingling with people." Nora and Ross opened the door and helped them off with their coats. "Sure swell, seeing you folks," Ross said. "You look well, Maddy. The cold's put roses in your cheeks." "On her nose, too," Bruce said, grinning. Madeline shivered, but it wasn't from the cold. How could they be so callous? How could they joke like that when they knew that never again would Tommy be able to spend a Thanksgiving with them. "Come on in the living room," Nora said cheerfully. "We have two other guests I'd like you to meet." Madeline's heart contracted with pain. "Nora, I can't stay, now. I couldn't meet strangers." Ross took a firm hold on her arm. "Oh, yes you can, Madeline. We hadn't intended having anyone else but us, but these kids needed a home on this day of days. We'd have been heels not to have them here, too." "I want you to meet Sergeant Brent Sherwood, and Corporal Bill Benning," Ross said, guiding her to the young men. "Don't get up boys," he added quickly, at their indication of rising. "These boys have been in the hospital," he explained to Madeline. She felt that all the discordant sounds in the world had come into the room and were dinning in her ears. Her head was heavy and her eyes felt out of focus. These young men in uniform became a conglomeration of blurred features; and somehow Tommy's face became mixed in with theirs. She couldn't speak. She wet her lips and tried to keep the terrible pain from making her faint. As from a distance, she heard Ross saying, "Mrs. Pearson hasn't been well for several months, and the difference between DINNER AT NORA'S 651 the cold outside and this warm room has been a httle upsetting." She allowed herself to be led to a chair. She didn't dare look at the young men, who had so courteously acknowledged the introduction. She would have to try to convince Nora that she was too ill to remain if Nora would just come near enough to speak to. But Nora had disappeared into the kitchen. The young men chattered with Bruce and Ross, and through the fog of her grief, Madeline heard them laughing and joking. How could those soldiers laugh and joke like that? Didn't they ever remember the boys who hadn't come back? They were here in this room, whole, hearty, and happy. Gradually, the haze around her cleared and she leaned back against her chair. Nora meant well, and she was fond of her. But Nora's son, Jimmy, pal of Tommy, was still safe, and was coming home soon. Nora came bustling in from the dining room, eyes sparkling, cheeks flushed. "Dinner is served," she said. Ross came over to help Madeline to her feet. Nora went over to the boys. "I intend to have two gentlemen lead me to my table," she said, beaming up at them. She could beam, thought Madeline bitterly. She hasn't lost her son. The taller. Sergeant Sherwood, picked up a cane from beside his chair. Madeline was startled. She hadn't noticed the cane before. It had been lying on the side she couldn't see. "You'll have to wait until I get Bill here up on his new feet," he said grinning. "The guy's all right once he gets on them, but he's only had them two weeks." To her astonishment and inward horror. Sergeant Sherwood tapped his own right leg with his cane, "My old wooden leg makes me awkward without my cane. It's new, too. But Bill here doesn't need a cane, the lucky bloke, once he gets standing." MADELINE couldn't move, but sat fascinated, while Sergeant Sherwood helped Corporal Benning up from the chair... Or tried to. It was evident that Bill was deliberately teasing and trying to make the process more difficult than it really was. With exaggerated grimaces and clowning, with pithy comments, he finally sighed and groaned. "Can't make it. Brent, old man. Guess I'd better go back to the old cash and carry system." Brent Sherwood, almost double with laughter, gave one last heave and pulled Bill Benning to his feet. For a long moment Bill stood there, swaying uncertainly, as a doll does when it has been set on its feet not quite on the straight. Then he gave himself a tiny hitch, and held out his arm gallantly to Nora, and said, "Madam, will you honor me? Old Brent here has all he can do to manage his cane." And Nora, laughing up at him, said, "I am indeed honored. Corporal." They led the way to the dining table, Bill taking careful strides on his new feet. Madeline finally managed to extricate herself from, her chair, clutched Ross's arm and followed, with Sergeant Sherwood and Bruce bringing up the rear. There they sat, around the beautifully decorated table, the immense brown turkey glistening on its silver platter, candlelight throwing a soft glow over all. The two boys made twelve-year-old noises at the turkey. Madeline didn't look at them. On a Thanksgiving day, two years ago, her Tommy, so young, so boyish, so sweet, had done the same thing. And his last Thanksgiving dinner had been rotten fish heads. Tommy... her heart cried.
She toyed with the food on her plate, and the little she put in her mouth was as tasteless as paper. The boys ate like ravenous children, exclaiming, complimenting Nora until she looked as if she'd float to the ceiling if she hadn't been weighted with food.
"Oh, boy! won't I ever remember this dinner," Bill Benning said conceitedly, as Nora served him a slice of mince pie, one of pumpkin, and a piece of fruitcake for the second shelf. "When I get my insurance business going, and get me my wife, the Blakes are coming to our house for dinner. And Trudie had better be been learning to cook."
Bruce said, around a bite of pie, "Where are you going to start this business?"
"In my home town." Bill's tone indicated that anyone was foolish to suggest anywhere else. "I got a girl there. She's full of plans. I have quite a bit saved when you've got a girl at home you don't spend much money except to send her stuff."
MADELINE found herself thinking that this Bill had personality, and that's what it took, as much as business ability, to get ahead in insurance. How could he look forward to a future, though, without feet? She suppressed a shiver. How could a girl...
"My girl says it isn't feet that make the man... and she's right... as if I didn't know," Bill went on. "I can go tramping through the woods... in all kinds of weather... can get my feet frostbitten."
Both boys laughed at this, but Madeline wanted to cry. A boy with no feet probably couldn't play tennis, couldn't dance...
"But what do you plan to do, Sergeant?" Ross asked Brent.
"Oh, I figure a pegleg's good for almost anything. I've got me a big ranch out west. That is, I sent the money to my folks when I was in the hospital, and they bought it for me. I'll raise horses... race some of them, maybe... I like to ride. Always have. Swell setup."
Madeline, for the first time since she arrived, felt the urge to speak directly to them. "You can ride horses?"
He grinned at her. "Yes'm, it'll be a cinch. Great future in the horse business."
"Oh, boy! when this is all over, the future sure is going to be hectic," chuckled Bill, "lots of competition... the spice of life... my dad always says."
"What tells you turn out," Brent scoffed.
As Madeline heard their laughter this time, it didn't shock her as it had at first. A great future, these boys said! How did they know? Their future was filled with handicaps. If Tommy... And sad-denly, she know that Tommy, clean, wholesome Tommy, was taken care of. A boy as fine as he would be in eternity. She realized that Tommy had no handicaps. But these boys had theirs... and their future was facing it. After all of the horror they had been though they still seemed to feel that the world was a wonderful place. If they had been frightened once, they had recovered.MADELINE knew, then, that she hadn't been frightened or grieved because she was feeling sorry for Tommy half as much as she had been feeling sorry for herself. Nora was right. She had been selfish. Her sadness came because she could no longer have the comfort of Tommy's presence, the opportunity to mother him. For the first time since word of Tommy's death, she felt a loosening of the tension and pain within her. Her heart quieted. These boys with their love, their faith, their fearlessness... They had come from blood-drenched battle fields, but they hadn't allowed the suffering to show. They were now thinking of it, not as suffering, but as a ticket of admission into the future. They had learned that they must watch their step; but that didn't mean that they thought the world was hopeless. She remembered when she was young... She could almost hear her grandparents saying that this younger generation was not as stable as the older folk. As people grew older they seemed to become more frightened... Many of them because they weren't strong enough in their faith. She knew now that the future held whatever one wanted it to hold. Bruce had known that... Dear Bruce... But she hadn't allowed him to try to tell her what he knew. For the first time since Tommy was taken prisoner, she felt sure that she could weep. If she were alone she would lie on her bed and let the tears bathe and refresh her awakened heart. But she was not alone. She found herself turning to Sergeant Sherwood and smiling at him. "If you gentlemen are still in this part of the country at Christmas time, my husband and I would like to have you spend Christmas with us." At Nora's pleased start of surprise, she said, "Tou and Ross, too, of course, Nora. And Jimmy will probably be home by that time, too."
