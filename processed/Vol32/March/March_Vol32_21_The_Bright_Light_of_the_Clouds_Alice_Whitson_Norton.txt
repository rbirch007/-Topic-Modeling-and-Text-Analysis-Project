The Bright Light of the Clouds
Alice Whitson Norton
"Men see not the bright light which is in the clouds"?Job 37:21.
HOW desolate, how colorless, how unattractive the world would be without its blue canopy! To the beauty of the seeing eye, it is God's moving picture screen, constantly changing, constantly thrilling the human heart with its beauty.
Take the dawn of the morning?did you ever watch it break across the eastern horizon?the glory of the stars, as the sun's bright rays dissolve them?the blueness of the sky against the mistiness of dew? All these are beautiful to the nature-loving eye of man. But it is the glow of sunset, the tinted clouds, the magic rivers, lakes and mountains that are formed from them just at the close of the day, that leave one speechless with awe and wonder.
A sunset view, like that from my garden, recently brought to my mind the quotation of Job?Job whose body was tormented with disease, who alone and lonesome?who never lost faith in God nor lost sight of the bright light of the clouds to which so many were blind.
Let us keep our eyes upon the bright lights of the clouds; they will give us the courage to struggle on when despair grips our souls; they will give us a new interest in beauty when the beauty of the world seems clouded against us; they point to God?a silent, steadfast witness?and rarely can one look upon the bright, light clouds and fail to feel the nearness of the Creator. Let us keep our eyes turned towards the beautiful things of life and not be as Job says, men who see not the bright light of the clouds.
