THE VISITING TEACHER'S PRAYER Eva M. R. Salway Humbly, we thy handmaidens come to thee today, Praying for thy guidance, in all we do and say. Asking for a blessing on the work now to be done, That we may feel thy presence, as we enter in each home. Give to us thy wisdom for all problems that arise, Help us to be cheerful, and faithful, loving, wise. Grant us thy Holy Spirit as we enter in each door. Help us bring peace and comfort, and glorify thee more. Help us to comfort sorrow, or guide the erring feet. Encourage all that's good and brave, as we our sisters meet. Bring to us remembrance, as we our topic teach, And help us more than all of these, to practice what we preach.
