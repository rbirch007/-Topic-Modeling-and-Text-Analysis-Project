gifts of his talented wife and to encourage her THE STORY OF A GIFTED LADY 153 to use them. It takes a big man to do that. In 1893, they visited the Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and later went to New York, Washington, Boston, San Francisco, and the Northwest, visiting especially the art galleries and other places of interest. In 1894, the young husband was called on a mission to the Southern States. Alice, being a good soldier, taught art in the public schools while he was gone. She also undertook serious work in art from J. T. Harwood, who had just returned from study in the Julian and Beaux Arts Academies of Paris, France. She also studied from Mary Teasdel, student of James McNeill Whistler. In 1898, she was urged by many friends to run for the legislature. In this, as in her many other activities, her husband counselled her acceptance. Said he, "Wifey," (his pet name for her) "if you want to help Utah to become art-minded, you will have to get in there and work for it." She was elected, and made herself noteworthy by introducing a bill which provided for an annual exhibition and state art collection. Georgina G. Marriott as director of fine arts at the State Fair put the exhibition into Alice's hands, and for five years she made the Art Gallery famous. Instead of giving many prizes, the best pictures were purchased, making them the property of the State as well as encouraging the artists. This greatly encouraged art studies and Utah artists also, establishing the nucleus of an art collection by the State of Utah, which was named in honor of the originator, "The Alice Art Collection.  ALICE MERRILL HORNE AS A GIRL Thus the Utah Art Institute was established, making Utah the first state in the Union to own a state art collection. Many prominent people made gifts of paintings, and this collection of over seventy pictures is now housed in the upper galleries of the State Capitol. After an existence of over forty years and an expenditure of over $60,000, the act was repealed in the interest of the so-called "Modern Art" (or is it art?) which at great expense is trying to convert the public to what is considered the New Art. Mrs. Home has remained true to her ideals of real beauty, however, and has turned much of her interest to sponsoring and providing art exhibitions for the public schools of the State. She has established over thirty art collections, of from fifteen to fifty paintings, by Utah's best artists. Hundreds of exhibitions have been held, and many thousands of dollars have thus been turned to Utah artists aside from the greater value of instilling a love of beauty and art in the lives of the younger generation. For fourteen years from 1902 to 1916 Mrs. Home was a member of the Relief Society General Board, and while there was active in preparing lessons on art appreciation and landscape study, which were used by the 40,000 members of the Relief Society. A book on this subject "Devotees and Their Shrines, A Handbook of Art" was later published. Another book written in dramatic form called "Columbus Westward Ho!" was published and used in the public schools for a time. Many other interests claimed her attention during all these years of active service. She is a charter member of the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers, and was instrumental in framing its constitution and bylaws; she was also its second general president. She sponsored a "Clean Milk for Utah" campaign, and as chairman of Public Health helped, with others, to arouse enough public sentiment to cause rigid inspection to be enforced for the benefit of all, especially babies. Four milk stations were opened in different parts of the city. Many babies died in Salt Lake City among them her own baby son, George Henry, Jr.  while the next summer only one baby death was reported! Mrs. Home was also active, with others, in organizing the Smokeless Fuel Federation, and for many years has labored to encourage the use of smokeless fuel and byproducts from Utah coals. She, with other forward-looking women, was instrumental in the formation of the Women's Chamber of Commerce, which has labored to make smokeless fuel a possibility for improving the health of Utah residents and the beauty of her towns and cities. Honors Have Sought Her For her many activities, Mrs. Home has rightly received merited recognition. In 1904, she represented the National Council of Women, as well as the National Women's Relief Society, at the International Council of Women, held in Berlin, Germany. In 1934, she was chosen by the Salt Lake City Council of Women as one of the first outstanding women, named by that body, for her many contributions and life-long promotion of art among the citizens of the State. Her latest honor was received in 1942, when she was given a Medal of Honor from the Academy of Western Culture for her civic service, especially in the promotion of Utah art appreciation and production. A large reception was held in the President's Suite at the Hotel Utah, with Mr. And Mrs. Alexander Schreiner, and Mr. And Mrs. Lee Greene Richards in charge of the ceremonies. Many prominent Utahns came to meet the little lady so greatly honored. All these awards have been richly deserved, and have done honor to the donors as well as to the recipient. One might think that a life so crowded with achievement would be enough for one small lady, but there remains yet to be told Her Great Achievement' In addition to the many activities enumerated above, her greatest hon- THE STORY OF A GIFTED LADY 155 or and award is the gift of Motherhood. Six children three sons and three daughters have come to bless the home of this favored family. Five of them have grown to a useful maturity Mary, Lyman, Virginia, Zora,' and Albert. They are all members of the Church and are leaders in their fields of labor. Two of them, Dr. Lyman and Dr. Albert, are successful doctors of medicine, while the two married daughters-Mary, Mrs. Leo C. Winder, and Zora, Mrs. J. G. Jeppson are making good homes and raising fine families. They are all active in civic betterment. Mr. Home met an untimely death in 1934, mother has continued to carry on her home duties as well as her many public activities. Alice has always had a sweet, attractive face; but to those who know her best, it seems that the halo of white hair frames a face growing more mellow and charming with the passing years. Though now approaching what some may designate as 'getting on in years," she still seems as young as ever, and is active in staging art exhibits in the Tea Room or a nine-window art show at Zion's Co-operative Mercantile Institution, or some school where art-appreciation is needed. When one sees her "toting" around the heavy pictures, placing them where they receive their best light, or may be seen to the best advantage (so that possible sales may reward the artist), one feels to exclaim, "What a Woman!" How wise to foster a life interest which may remain when children are grown and home ties are lessened! How much better it is to have work to do that helps others more than oneself, rather than to sit idly at home, allowing or expecting one's children to "take care of one's old age." What a glorious thing is independence! Wliat an achievement to know that one's life work is being well done, in spite of circumstances or the passing years. Such a blessing is the well-earned reward of our gifted lady, Alice Merrill Home. And here, dear friend, while you are living and working, is our bouquet of appreciation and admiration! GIFTS Grace A. Cooper When gods of sound and goddesses of color send Down gifts to man, their gems and blooms and music blend; Like silence, drugged, the pearl-gray fog escapes the bay, Soft murmurs from the golden glow of summer day Join whispered converse of the leaves of verd and jade; Late roses echo reds of rubies' deeper shade. When beryls raise their batons, all is statue-still, Then amethysts and violets, in cadence, trill; Turquoise and larkspur improvise a symphony, The diamond and jasmine play their melody. Between the black and darkened clouds are silver rifts  For gods and goddesses, to mankind, blend their gifts. Sixtii LJears Kjigo Excerpts from the Woman's Exponents, March i and March 15, 1885 "For the Rights of the Women of Zion and the Rights of the Women of All Nations" Love. This is a little word of only four letters, yet how potent, how powerful, and with it comes our liberty or bondage. If we love right, we are free; free in our souls, pure in our hearts, let come what may, though oft through surrounding circumstances and worldly influence we are swerved from the right, not having the moral courage to resist evil, or know for ourselves the sad results of weakness and hatred until too late.... Where can we find pure love? In the homes of the Latter-day Saints; there it sits enthroned. If sorrow and death visit such a household there is comfort and relief at hand.... Our principles are perfect, and we will continue to love them and strive to live them, God being our helper; protect the rights of others, envy no one, be pure in our daily walk in life and leave the result in God's hands. Zina D. H. Young. Editorial Notes: On Saturday, March yth, a number of ladies, intimate friends of Mrs. Rachel R. Grant, met at her residence in the 13th Ward, it being the anniversary of the lady's birthday. The time was spent in social converse, supper being announced at six p.m., when the guests repaired to the residence of Apostle H. J. Grant, where a sumptuous repast had been prepared for the occasion. The table was handsomely set out, and the viands were delicious. Mrs. Lucy Grant, the amiable hostess, and her sister, Mrs. JuHa Woolley, with Miss Maggie Ivins assisting, waited upon the ladies in the most charming manner, and every one seemed to thoroughly enjoy themselves. About ten o'clock the party broke up. Many good wishes were expressed for the lady who is a great favorite with her friends. May she live to enjoy many more years of prosperity and happiness.  R.S. REPORTS Alma Ward, Mesa City. Editor Exponent: Owing to our isolated situation we see but few communications from this part of the country in your valuable paper, hence the liberty I take in penning a few lines to you, hoping you will be kind enough to give them space in your paper. We were organized May 31st, 1883, under the direction of President McDonald, with Anna Klienman, President; Henrietta Standage and Laureta Staples, Counselors; Sarah M. Mullens, Secretary; Sophronia A. Standage, Assistant Secretary; Hannah M. Stewart, Treasurer. We have thirty-five names enrolled, with an average attendance of nineteen. We hold our meetings semi-monthly, and have a very good time. The sisters are trying to live their religion and serve God. The Exponent is read in our meetings, with other Church works, striving to render them a source of benefit and mutual improvement. Wishing f Jr the success of the Exponent, I remain, Your sister in the Gospel, S. A. S. Bluff City. Editor Exponent: Thinking that a few lines from Bluff City would not come amiss, we take pleasure in writing that our Relief Society is trying to keep along evenly with the rest of the branches of the Relief Society as near as possible under the circumstances, with a good spirit and feeling at heart. We hold our testimony and teacher's meetings once a month, and our working meetings once in two weeks. We are few in number, but our meetings are well attended and our desire is to do all the good we can in helping to build up the Kingdom of God in this far off land.... We have had a very pleasant winter and the health of the people is very good. There has been no sickness nor death, for which we feel very thankful, and realize as a great blessing. Ever praying for the welfare of Zion, we remain, Your sisters in the Gospel, Jane M. Walton, President; Irene Haskell, Secretary.
