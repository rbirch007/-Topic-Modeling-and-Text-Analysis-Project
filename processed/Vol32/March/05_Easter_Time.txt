EASTER TIME Ruth H. Chadwick As the drabness of the winter Melts beneath a warmer sky. All the gentle, stirring breezes Invigorate, and cry The message of each living thing-Each blade of grass so green. Each swelling bud, each quivering tree. The urge of powers unseen. This gift of life, again renewed, A throbbing, pulsing force, Rises from its winter's sleep To beautify its source. These symbols of the springtime, Flaunt new banners of the year; Then Easter comes around to bless. And sanctify and cheer.
