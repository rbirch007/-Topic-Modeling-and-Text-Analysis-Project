President Franklin D. Roosevelt Passes PRESIDENT Franklin Delano Roosevelt died suddenly at Warm Springs, Georgia, on Thursday, April 12, 1945. He had entered upon his fourth term as President of the United States in January 1945. We reprint the statement issued by the First Presidency following his death: The President has gone. His passing will be mourned by many millions, many of whom have regarded his course as divinely inspired. He has lived in, indeed has been himself a part of, one of the great crises of the world's history, during which opposing political and economic ideologies have striven for mastery. History will give him his proper place and his due measure of greatness. He had devoted, almost fanatical friends, and bitter, implacable enemies, but all will grant him the need of enthusiasm for his policies, determination for their carrying out, and the highest courage in the presence of physical handicaps of which he rarely spoke and which he brought into subjection to an all but indomitable will. He, in common with all mankind, has this great blessing: he will be judged righteously by the Lord and rewarded for the good he accomplished. We extend our deepest sympathy to his bereaved loved ones and friends. April 12, 1945 Vice-President Harry S. Truman was sworn in as President of the United States by Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone in the White House at 7:08 on the evening of the day President Roosevelt died.
