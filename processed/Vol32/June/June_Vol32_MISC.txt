THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE VOL 32, NO. 6 JUNE 1945 IT has been my privilege to bear my testimony in England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Germany, Sweden, Denmark; in Canada and Mexico; in the Hawaiian Islands and in far-off Japan, that I know as I know I live, that God lives. I have approached Him in prayer time and time again, and my prayers have been answered beyond question of a doubt, I know that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God, the Redeemer of the world; that He came to earth with a divinely appointed mission to die upon the cross for the sins of man-kind, I know as I know that I live that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the true and the living God, and that his declaration that we should be driven from" city to city, from' county to county, state to state, and finally to the Rocky Mountains has been literally fulfilled.
