PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT Seventh President Of The Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter-day Saints Born Nov. 22, 1856   Died May 14, 1945 In Memoriam President Heber J. Grant Elder Bryant S. Hinckley SURROUNDED by his family and immediate associates President Heber J. Grant passed peacefully away at his home on Eighth Avenue, Salt Lake City, at 6:55 P.M., May 14. Thus ended one of the most remarkable careers in the history of this people.
While in California, five years ago, the President suffered a severe stroke which paralyzed his left side. He rallied from this stroke but never completely recovered the use of his leg or arm. This made it difficult for him to get around and impaired his health, but he has been able to sign letters and pass upon important matters up to within less than a week of the last.
This coming November he would have been eighty-nine years of age. He carried the weight of many years cheerfully and courageously. His career has been a long and marvelous one. While his life was an open book, it required an intimate contact with him to appreciate the finer qualities of his nature, to understand the nobility of his character, the greatness of his heart, the tenderness and generosity of his shining soul.
Literally thousands of people have been the recipients of his favors, of gifts and remembrances which have greatly endeared him to their hearts. No other man of his means has been more generous to widows, to orphans, to those overtaken with misfortune or sorrow. He has gone! What a cloud of witnesses will rise up and bless his memory forever.
His life has been a record of service to others. He was strikingly unselfish, pure in heart, sincere and lofty in purpose, constant in his loyalty to his friends, his country and his Creator. All of his endowments, and they were of a most superior order, were imbedded in a deep spirituality which gave direction and effectiveness to the dynamic energy which was so characteristic of him.
His life was a delightful definition of true religion. He was cultured in mind, refined in manner, ripened in judgment, fraught in spirit, inherently honest and transparently frank. He had that nobility of soul, that generosity of spirit, that greatheartedness that distinguishes one truly great. The story of his youthful achievements will never dim. They will endure for all time as noble traditions among this people. His name will shine forever as an example of the sterling virtues of industry, patience, and perseverance. Whether playing baseball, mastering penmanship, helping banks or building sugar factories he achieved his end. Page  RACHEL RIDGEWAY IVINS GRANT AND HER SON HEBER This picture was taken on the ninth birthday of President Grant. His life covered a long span of eventful years. Ox teams and covered wagons were familiar in the streets of Salt Lake when he was a boy. The Pony Express, the telegraph, the railroad, the high-powered motor car, the radio, the airplane all came in his day and he kept step with the great march of human progress. The generation of men with whom he started has gone   they will greet him joyfully on the other side. He was a friend maker. In all parts of the world he won the warm and enduring friendship of eminent men. The greatest tribute ever paid to a living citizen of Utah was paid to President Grant on his 82d by five hundred of the leading men of this State, and this was a spontaneous expression of esteem and affection for the President as a great citizen. PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 325 PRESIDENT AND SISTER HEBER J. GRANT birthday He was a great son of a great mother. The memory of his mother glowed in his soul and gladdened his life to the end of his days. He paid this tribute to her: "I live today in the eightieth year of my life as one whose mother was all to me. She set an example of integrity, of devotion and love, and of determination and honor second to none. Her life was a sermon that rings through my soul to this day. One of the main reasons I am President of the Church today is that I have followed the advice and counsel and the burning testimony of the divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ, which came to me from my mother." His wife, Augusta Winters Grant, who survives him, possesses the same unruffled serenity that the President's mother possessed. She is a brilliant and cultured woman who has in every way sustained her distinguished husband whose devotion to her was beautiful. President Grant was a great leader of a great cause a prophet inspired of Heaven who taught by example, who practiced first and then preached, who led the way and the people cheerfully followed. Permeating his words and motivating his actions was a zeal for the truth, a love for God and humanity. He lived long, abundantly, purposefully devoting his great energies to exalted ends, and died peacefully. It is hard to think of him in the past. The world seems lonely without him. We believed in him, enjoyed him, loved him, and we shall cherish his memory forever. I have urged upon the people, and have been called a crank for so doing, the observance of the Word of Wisdom and I expect to continue to be a crank in that respect to the end of my life. Lam converted beyond the shadow of a doubt that no man or woman in this Church who does not observe the Word of Wisdom can grow and increase in a knowledge and testimony of the gospel as he or she could otherwise do. President Heber J. Grant, June 25, 1932. I will ask no man to be more liberal with his means according to his ability, for the upbuilding of the Church, than I myself shall be; I will ask no man to be more strict in the observance of the Word of Wisdom than I am willing to be; I will ask no man to be more conscientious and prompt in the payment of his tithes and offerings than myself; I will ask no man to be more ready and willing to come early and go late and to give more of his time and talents to the work of the Lord than I am willing to do and to give.  President Heber J. Grant, 89th Annual General Conference, June 1919.
