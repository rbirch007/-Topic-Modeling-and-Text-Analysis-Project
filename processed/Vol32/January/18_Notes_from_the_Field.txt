NOTES FROM THE FIELD Vera White Pohlman, General Secretary-Treasurer Regulations governing the submittal of material for "Notes from the Field" appear in the Magazine for February 1944, page 104. VISITING TEACHING Oakland Stake (California) RUTH S. HILTON, stake Relief Society president, reported in 1944 that at the officers' meeting in connection with the 1943 ward Relief Society conference ?we suggested and urged that special meetings or conventions be held in all of the wards for the purpose of honoring and giving instruction to the visiting teachers, as well as to furnish opportunity for personal expression of problems by the visiting teachers themselves. These meetings have now all been held with several members of the stake board in attendance at each. We have heard original poems, short bits of drama, song, and speeches, all lending emphasis to the work of our visiting teacher, as well as portraying the magnitude of her responsibility. Often lunch was served, with the teacher who had given the greatest length of service as the honored guest. Our visiting teaching since the curtailment of gasoline and tires has been a real challenge to us. However, our sisters are gradually being converted to the point of view that we may change the method but 100 per cent visiting teaching is still our goal.' Gradual improvement has been shown all winter and our report for Page 44 last month (March) shows a high since the war began, with four wards having 100 per cent and four others between 90 and 91 per cent. We are happy to note a steady trend upward in our stake as follows: January 1944 ?60 per cent; February? 70 per cent; March?77 per cent." Young Stake (Colorado and New Mexico) BERGETTA A. COVINGTON, released in 1944 as stake president of Relief Society, reported early in that year "that the Kirtland Ward had achieved 100 per cent visiting teaching during the past year. Our stake visiting teachers' message leader made a special effort to obtain such results in all our wards by providing exceptionally fine messages for the summer months, but the Kirtland Ward is the only ward to report 100 per cent for the full year. This success is due in part to the splendid follow-up work of the supervisor. Sister Elsie Tanner, who made a special effort to see that it was done the first week in each month. If the teachers were unable to go she provided substitutes or went herself." Harriet D. Foutz is now president of this stake Relief Society.

MERRILL, president of this stake Relief Society, reports that a stake visiting teachers' convention was held last September to which were invited the stake presidency, advisory high councilman, ward bishops, ward Relief Society executive officers, and visiting teachers. The aim of the convention was to explain the modification in funds, the change in meetings, and to increase an appreciation of the teachers' duties. The stake board presented a model teachers' training - report meeting. Stake board members representing visiting teachers gave verbal reports as the stake secretary called the districts by number. The stake message leader gave a sample lesson, and the president's message included the information regarding discontinuance of collections and the combination of report and training meetings. NOTES FROM THE FIELD VISITING TEACHERS OF IDAHO FALLS STAKE at a stake visiting teachers' convention, September 24, 1944 "We prepared skits for the wards to present, demonstrating visiting teachers confronting the problems of (1) making friends where they were formerly not welcome; (2) solving the visiting of the out-lying district; ad (3) showing teachers ability to meet emergences. A second group of skits depicted incidents proving the value of service done by visiting teachers. ?Refreshments were served and a spirit of friendliness was enjoyed.?
