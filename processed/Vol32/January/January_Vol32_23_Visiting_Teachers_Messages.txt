Visiting Teachers' Messages Sources of Strength?The Beatitudes Lesson 7?Blessed Are the Peacemakers Elder Bryant S. Hinckley For Tuesday, April 3, 1945 "Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God" (Matt. 5:9). Objective: To show that enduring peace between men and nations, in the home and abroad, will come only through the adoption of the precepts of the Master. TO be able to compose differences, reconcile those at variance, promote harmony and happiness is a rare and precious gift, and this is within the reach of the humblest. We may not be able to write a book, accumulate a fortune, distinguish ourselves in the field of statesmanship or politics, we may not startle the world with inventions, but we can all contribute to the peace and happiness of those about us, and, in so doing, we become real peacemakers. Such indeed are the children of God. Whosoever cherishes hate in his heart, whoever makes it easier for men and women to suspect each other, to mistrust each other, that individual, regardless of his profession, is fighting against peace. Whoever is hard to live with in the home, whoever is a promoter of strife between man and man, whoever creates discord, discontent, and misunderstanding, whoever preaches selfishness, whoever fosters prejudice is a disturber of peace. On the other hand, if we are peacemakers, if by what we say, by what we are, by what we do, we preach the "Gospel of Reconciliation"; if we promote peace in the home, peace in social circles, peace between nation and nation, then we are making common cause with the Prince of Peace. His gospel is the gospel of peace. Enduring peace between men and nations, in the home and abroad, will come only through the adoption of the precepts of the Master, and through magnifying these precepts by actually applying them in our daily lives. "Peace on earth" is not to be established by congress and parliament, nor by any group of international representatives, peace cannot be legislated into existence for it comes from within. The only way to build a peaceful community is to build men and women who are lovers and makers of peace. Each in of your Father which is in heaven, dividual holds in his own hands, in a... (Matt. 5:44-45) measure, the peace of the world.* Ruskin said: **Do you ask to be *'Love your enemies, bless them the companions of nobles? Make that curse you, do good to them that yourself noble and you shall be." If hate you, and pray for them which you asked to be called the "children despitefully use you, and persecute of God," cultivate the divine gift of you; That ye may be the children making peace and you shall be. *See discourse of Elder John A. Widtsoe, Conference Pamphlet, October 1943. Literature New Testament Lesson 7?New Testament Epistles Dr. Howard R. Driggs For Tuesday, April 17, 1945 IT is somewhat difficult for folk today with widespread mail service, the press, and the radio at their command, to visualize how severely limited were the means of communication in the long ago. In these days, gospel messages may be broadcast with electric speed over all the world. With the Savior and his apostles, gospel teaching was largely restricted to places within walking distance, and to conversing with the few who cared to listen. It was a kind of home-to-home missionary service, with occasional opportunities to give the divine message to larger groups, attracted by the marvelous works and words of the Master.
Later, when Paul was carrying forward in the realms of Greece and Rome, he wrote epistles to help him spread the truth. These gospel letters were far more, however, than ordinary communications. In letters, they carried greetings and cheer and courage to the different branches of the Church and, at times, to individuals. They sometimes dealt also with specific problems that troubled the saints. But more than this, they were masterful interpretations of the gospel of Jesus Christ. As such they hold a high place in the world's great literature.
The epistles found in the New Testament, written not only by Paul, but by other evangelists, have classic qualities. Though addressed for the most part to specific congregations, they ring with truth for people of all time. Outside the gospels, no other religious works have been more often quoted in the Christian world; nor have any had a more profound influence in guiding action along ways of righteousness. Most of the epistles preserved for us in the New Testament were produced by Paul. How many other gospel letters this ardent missionary wrote, we do not know. Through the busy, troubled years of his ministry he was constantly speaking?portraying the gospel with fervor and clarity before varied types and classes of people from common folk to kings. A hint of his eloquence comes to us in the complimentary remark of King Agrippa: After Paul, as a prisoner, had pleaded the cause of Christ before him, the King said, "Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian. And Paul replies, "I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds" (Acts 26:28-29). His persuasive eloquence vibrates in the epistles preserved for us. These gospel letters reveal not only a clear mind, but a fervent soul. They are the blossoming and the fruitage of years of devotion to the cause of truth, which, with direct commission from the Savior, he had made an intrinsic part of his own being. It was dearer to him than life itself. Oliver Wendell Holmes once said, in effect, that sermons should not be written until they had been spoken many times?this to round and polish them as pebbles are smoothed and perfected by rolling with the waves on the beach. Paul doubtless often voiced the profound truths, and the reasons for his belief in Christ, before he wrote his epistles. When he did address" one of these gospel letters to saints he had helped to bring into the fold, he was ready for such written expression. He talked to them fervently with his pen; and in doing so, he often expressed great truths with literary finish and force. Following are a few of his many lines that bear out this statement: For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation (Romans 1:16), For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord (Romans 6:23). The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God (Romans 8:16). Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good (Romans 12:9). And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power (I Corinthians 2:4). Let all things be done decently and in order (I-Corinthians 14:40). If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable (I Corinthians 15:19). O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? (I Corinthians 15:55). But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ "(11 Corinthians 11:3). Be not deceived: God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap (Galatians 6:7). 'Taul," says Dinsmore, "had a rare power of condensing much wisdom in a sentence. That is why preachers find him so rich in text." LESSON DEPARTMENT 57 Not all parts of his epistles, it is true, are of the highest literary standard. At times, as critics have pointed out, his sentences are not close-knit; and in places he lacks directness and simplicity. Yet, one quality is never lacking, and that is sincerity. The great evangelist spoke and wrote under the inspiration of the Master, who had called him to his mission to help save mankind. It is this spirit that gave undying vitality to his words of truth and light as he himself so well said: 'The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life." Under the impulse of the poetic spirit, Paul rises at times to unsurpassed literary excellence. An outstanding example of this is the poem ?for such it may well be called?on Charity* (or Love), I Corinthians, chapter thirteen. Read its beautiful lines aloud, thoughtfully: Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity. Observe the perfect balance, the cadence of the lines in this gospel poem. It has the qualities of Hebrew lyric, with something of Grecian polish added. Note also such picturesque expressions as "sounding brass and tinkling cymbal," "suffereth long and is kind," "vaunteth not itself; is not puffed up." Mark too, such upbuilding spiritual suggestions as "seeketh not her own," "thinketh no evil," "rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth." With clarity and charm the lofty theme is developed to its simple impressive close. Its literary excellence is well described in these words of Thoreau: "Perfect sincerity and transparency make a great part of beauty, as in dewdrops, lakes and diamonds." Other writers of New Testament Epistles, though producing fewer of these than did Paul, still have bequeathed to us some precious gospel letters. Of these we have in the New Testament: one by James; two by Peter; three by John; and one by Jude, the brother of James. To James, the apostle who was cruelly slain by the tyrant Herod, Latter-day Saints will ever be deeply indebted. It was he who wrote the *Some translators prefer the word love. Either form is beautiful. lines that inspired a boy, Joseph Smith, to seek the Lord in prayer. "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, driven with the wind and tossed" (James 1:5-6). Acting on this sound advice, Joseph took the first step that led to the restoration of the true gospel of Christ in these latter days. In the Epistle of St. James will be found other inspired lines. A few of them follow: Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above (James 1:17). Let every man be swift to hear, slow'' to speak, slow to wrath (James 1:19). Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only (James 1:22). What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? Can faith save him? (James 2:14). Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter? (James 3:11). And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace (James 3:18). Good counsel, given in a sweet spirit, characterizes the Epistle of James. One feels in his lines the heart of a man who has tested the truths of life, and is giving them forth as a father talking in plain, but kindly words, to his children. In the Epistles of Peter, likewise, we get closer to the man himself. His gospel letters reveal a vigorous leader in the cause of righteousness. With forthright sentences, tempered with wisdom and love, he lays down fundamental principles in his trenchant lines of counsel: But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you (I Peter As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby (I Peter 2:2). Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evil doers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation (I Peter 2:12). And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins (I Peter 4:8). But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ (II Peter 3:18). Echoes of the Gospel of Saint John are found in the three epistles written by this "beloved disciple." He re-emphasizes the manifestation of God through his only begotten Son, Jesus Christ. He impresses the truth that Jesus was sent to propitiate, not only the sins of the Jews, but the whole world. He stresses also the truth that, if we walk in the light of the Savior, we are in fellowship one with another and with God. From these lines of John's gospel letters we can catch something of his spirit: He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now (I John 2:9). He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love (I John 4:8). LESSON DEPARTMENT 59 Perfect love casteth out fear (I John 4:18). For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one (I John 5:7). I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth (II John 1:4). Discussion and Activities 1. (a) What incidents of the New Testament show the modes of travel in those days?
