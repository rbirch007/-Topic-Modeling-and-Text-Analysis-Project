A Stone, in Place of Bread "Or what man is there of you, if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?" (Matt. 7:9). THIS soul-searching question of the Savior recalls to one's mind the almost sublime relationship which exists between a child and his parents? the sweet dependency, utter trust, and confidence of a child in his parents, and the feeling of security enjoyed by the child because his parents ever strive to provide a protecting bulwark between him, in his youth, and the world at large. The parent, on his side, treasures his God-given eternal gift and plans and dreams for his future joy with almost a selfless love. In the early, formative years of a child's life before he has reached the years of accountability at the age of eight, the foundation of his character is built largely upon his observation of the actions of his parents and the training that they are able to implant as a guide to his conduct. Rarely does a parent fail to provide the necessary food for the full development of his child's physical body; but, in the matter of his full spiritual growth, how often does a man, "if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?" These early years are the golden time in which to feed a child the bread of life, the time to train him to pray, to keep holy the Sabbath day, to pay his tithing, to observe the Word of Wisdom, to uphold the Church authorities and in all his daily conduct to train him to live in such a way that the Spirit of the Lord may ever dwell with him. Any laxness in the strict observance of the laws of the Church by his parents will be noted by a child, and may have a lasting influence upon his future life. A mother who drinks tea or coffee opens wide the door for her child to reject other parts of the Word of Wisdom which she herself does observe. A father who allows liquor to be served in his home, even though he himself does not partake of it, is inviting his children to become partakers when they are grown. Page 30 The use of alcohol with its attendant misery and degradation is becoming more widespread each day, and all that any Latter-day Saint parent can do, by example and precept, to impress upon his children the tragic effects which alcohol has upon the lives of those who use it, is absolutely essential. These are but two instances of the many which might be cited where a parent offers to his child a stone in place of bread. In the matter of setting an example to one's children it might be profitable for Latter-day Saint parents also to consider the significance of these words of the Savior: Verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise? (John 5:19) At the beginning of the new year, then, let any parent who may have been lax in the example he has set his child, set his house in order, and provide at all times for his child the bread of everlasting life. M.S.S. The Y. W. M. I. A. Observed its Diamon Jubilee. The Y.W.M.I.A. observed its diamond Jubilee, Tuesday, November 28, 1944, with impressive services conducted in the Lion House in the same room where President Brigham Young assembled his daughters seventy-five years ago and effected an organization whereby the daughters of Israel might "get a living testimony of the truth" and "improve in everything that is good and beautiful." This Association originally known as the Retrenchment Association, later as the Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement Association, and at present as the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association, has, during its seventy-five years of existence, touched the lives of tens of thousands of the daughters of Zion, helping them to develop their talents, obtain knowledge of the gospel, and to live happy, useful lives in conformity with gospel standards.
An opening feature of the observance in the Lion House was the reading by Presiding Patriarch Joseph F. Smith of words spoken by President Young in founding the Association. President Lucy G. Cannon then spoke, relating interesting facts and incidents connected with its beginning. She also talked of the earnestness with which the daughters of President Young accepted their assignment as members of the Association, and also gave interesting statistics showing its activities and growth. Among the honored guests were Ruth May Fox, age ninety-one, only living past president of the organization who delightfully reminisced, and two of President Young's daughters, Mrs. Mabel Y. Sanborn and Mrs. Fannie Y. Clayton. A very impressive and appropriate feature of the occasion was the marking of the organization room by an artistic plaque bearing an inscription relative to the founding of the organization including words of President Young used in inaugurating the Association. Elder George Albert Smith, after paying tribute to the organization and those identified with it through the years, dedicated the plaque.
The Relief Society General Board recognizes the importance of the Y.W.M.I.A. in the program of the Church, and acknowledges with gratitude its excellent contribution in guiding and directing the daughters of Zion. It congratulates the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association on its past achievements and wishes for it continued growth and accomplishment. B.S.S. NOTES TO THE FIELD Remodeled clothing TODAY, when clothing is of wartime quality and prices are high, many women are finding it advantageous to search their closets for used clothing of prewar quality to remodel into attractive, serviceable garments. Children's clothing, at present, presents a special problem in that it is not only expensive and of wartime quality, but in many localities it is difficult to buy. The wise, thrifty mother is clothing her children with garments remade from used clothing. Following are a few suggestions for remodeling clothing: General Suggestions for Procedure 1. Be sure used material is worth using again. Don't waste time on worn, threadbare, or moth-eaten materials that won't last. 2. Be sure old articles are carefully picked apart, washed or dry cleaned, and pressed before using. Most woolen materials can be washed, 3. Be sure fabric is suitable for the planned remodeled article. Don't use materials of a weave, weight, or color not suited to the uses to which the remodeled article will be put. Some fabrics have a definite "adult" look and should be used in remodeling articles for adults; other fabrics are more suitable for children's clothing. Don't use material that is too heavy for small children's clothes. 4. A style should be chosen when remodeling to fit the material so that a minimum of piecing need be done. 5. Don't use original buttonholes, loop fastenings, etc., unless they are substantial. Generally, the original garment receives most wear at these points. Page 32 6. Be careful of color combinations. Poor color combinations may readily spoil an otherwise attractive garment. 7, Material that is worth using is worthy of good workmanship. The same fine workmanship should go into remodeled articles as goes into articles made of new material. Suggestive Remodeling Projects A. For boys 1. Pants from adults' pants 2. Overcoats from adults' overcoats (if material isn't too heavy). 3. Snowsuits from old suits or coats, or from woolen or heavy part-woolen blankets. 4. Shirts in small sizes from adults' shirts, especially from dress shirts where, frequently, only the collar is worn. 5. Shorts from men's shirts (if material is strong enough). 6. Sport coats from men's coats (if they have patch pockets). If pockets are set-in, then a sleeveless jerkin could be made, or the back and sleeves could be used for part of a sport coat and a contrasting material could be used to complete the garment. 7. Coveralls or play suits for the small child who crawls or for the toddler ?either boy or girl?from the backs of the legs of old overalls. B. For girls 1. Suits from men's suits (if fabric and color are suitable). 2. Small gored skirts or jumpers from men's coats. 3. Coats from ladies' coats (if material is sufficiently youthful looking)- 4. Dresses from adults' dresses (if fabric and color are suitable). 5. White blouses from men's white shirts. NOTES TO THE FIELD 33 7. Panties from shirt tails, from the bottom of underslips, or from underslips used with sheer party or formal dresses. 8. Front aprons from men's shirts. 9. Jerkins from soft woolen articles. 10. Envelope handbags, lapel ornaments, half hats or flowers for the hair, and other accessories, from old bright felt hats. General Suggestions 1. Pieces cut from old suits or coats, crocheted around and sewed together make good afghans. Old cotton house dresses, shirts and aprons cut and sewed may be used for woven throw rugs, hooked rugs, or other types of rugs. Salt or sugar sacks sewed together and hemmed make very satisfactory dishcloths. Flour sacks dyed and sewed together make satisfactory soft quilt linings. (It is almost impossible to buy plain materials suitable for this purpose at the present time.) Good pieces of knit underwear crocheted around make satisfactory wash cloths.
