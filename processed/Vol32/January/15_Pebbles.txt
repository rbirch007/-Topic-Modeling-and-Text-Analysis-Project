PEBBLES Norma Wrathall I took some pebbles from the brook, Their colors glowing clear and bright With shades of blue and amethyst, And coral streaked with white; But as they dried upon my hand They were as dull and drab as sand. Rare moments snatched from life's swift flow Fade as we long to hold them fast; Dear cherished dreams grow old before We catch a fleeting glimpse at last; And yet, in retrospect they seem Like pebbles shining in the stream.
