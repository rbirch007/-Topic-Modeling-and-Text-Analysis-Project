YOUR SON AND MINE Grace Zenor Pratt When in the night you hear the planes go roaring overhead, You're thinking of your son... And Io f mine... They are both pilots somewhere over there? Yet they are in our hearts day after day... And in the night you wake and speak his name, You pray that he is safe; I do the same... Perhaps it has been long and prayer has been A stranger to our lips... All that is different now? So when the planes go roaring overhead at night 'Our heads we humbly bow... And when we see a group of sailors in the town, Merry and rollicking in their brave attire, We pause and wish to speak a few brief words? For these are but a symbol of a million more Who sail beyond the horizon to many a distant shore... Among them are our sons... Who somewhere on the seas perform their task, Nor fear to face whatever fate may bring? And for these sons we crave safe harboring....
