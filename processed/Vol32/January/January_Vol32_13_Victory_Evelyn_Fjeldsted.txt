VICTORY Evelyn Fjeldsted If one can work a score of years To prove a fact that few can see And still, undaunted, can persist? This is an unseen victory. If condemnation one must face Because of someone's treachery, If he can know that truth in time Will free?this, too, is victory. If through misfortune one has lost His earthly goods and trusted friends, If he with hope can build again? This, we agree, is victory. But if one can keep his faith and meet With courage what must seem to be The ultimate defeat of life? This is the crowning victory.
