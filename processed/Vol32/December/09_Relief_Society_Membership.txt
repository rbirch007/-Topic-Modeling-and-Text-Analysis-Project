Relief Society membership. The circulation has increased from 55,500 in 1941 to 73, 620 as of July 1945. This splendid increase in circulation has been the main factor in enabling us to maintain the $1 subscription price. We are now pleased to announce to you that government paper restrictions are lifted and beginning with the November issue the Magazine will add eight pages. The Magazine has more than current value.

Recommended courses of study have been followed in most of the missions as well as in the stakes and these have been generally well received by Relief Society members.
Figures for the past four years on phases of compassionate service which can be tabulated are very interesting. For each of the four years, visits to the sick and homebound did not vary a great deal. During the period, December 1941 to December 1944, an average of 132,000 visits were made annually to the sick and homebound, and an average of 19,000 days' care was given the sick annually by our Relief Society sisters. Services rendered by Relief Society in time of death averaged 600 monthly.
Relief Society women have wholeheartedly supported the war effort. Extensive service has been given the Red Cross sewing and other programs. Relief Society women have also been active in salvage and food conservation programs. During the past four years tremendous amounts of regular Relief Society sewing have been done; ward conferences and special activities, such as Relief Society socials and anniversary programs, have gone successfully forward. Hundreds of meetings in addition to the regular weekly Relief Society meetings have been held, with encouraging gains being made in the number of ward preparation meetings held.
