Visiting Teachers' Messages Sources of Strength?Charity Lesson 6~Charity Rejoiceth in the Truth Dr. Lowell L. Bennion For Tuesday, March 5, 1946 Objective: To show that one who is truly charitable rejoiceth in the truth. We do not always rejoice in the truth?in a knowledge of things as they were, and as they shall be. Sometimes the truth is embarrassing, if not humiliating to us. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?DECEMBER 1945 We are reluctant to admit our  mistakes of the past; to acknowledge our circumstances in the present; or to foresee clearly the consequences of our present behavior in the future. "All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes" says one of the proverbs of the Bible. Love of self encourages us to protect ourselves with repeated coatings of self-justification. If a neighbor casts a reflection on us or on the behavior of our children, we are inclined to pass judgment on the neighbor by thinking of his ill-rendered deeds or those of his children rather than to weigh, in the light of truth, the reflection cast on us by the neighbor. Even in our efforts to improve people, we must begin by accepting them for what they are. A weary mother frequently rebels against the unceasing, and often destructive and mischievous behavior of her children. When she does, she is but heaping coals upon the fire. Her opportunity to influence her children is to realize the truth that they were born to function; that activity is the normal characteristic of personality; and that her only course is to guide their activity into wholesome and creative channels. Three positive attitudes are open to us toward the truth, (i) We can know the truth. This is an important and necessary step in any satisfactory relationship with it. Yet, this is not enough, for we may know the truth but ignore or even oppose it. (2) We can act in conformity with truth. (3) We can love the truth and rejoice in it. This is the highest relation man can have to truth. To live in harmony with the principles of the gospel, not from intellectual assent nor from obedience alone, but from love, is to rejoice in the truth. Charity?which "vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, seeketh not her own"?is free to rejoice in the truth. And only he who has the charity that "rejoiceth in the truth" is truly free. Literature The Bible in Our Literature Lesson 6?Bible Influence as Revealed in Our Fiction * Dr. Howard R. Drigg's For Tuesday, March 19, 1946 NOVELS came not many years after the invention of the printing press. Prior to the development of this means of spreading literature far and wide, folk were limited to myths, fairy stories, legends, told orally about the firesides. LESSON DEPARTMENT 773 Sometimes these, woven together  
round a hero, would become a national epic, to be passed on, usually in verse form, down the years. Printing expanded the opportunity for the creation and distribution of not only verse but of fictional stories in prose.
With the drama banned by the Puritans in Cromwell's day, a natural demand had come for some substitute of dramatic cast. Fiction was the answer. It is closely allied to the drama. Indeed, many of our best plays are based on good novels. Any well-written story may be changed to a drama mainly by just eliminating the descriptive parts and by using scenery and costume, with a few stage directions, in their stead. The dialogue is, of course, given by the characters in the play.
All that might be said as to the qualities that mark an effective drama, applies with equal force to the novel. If it is to grip and hold the reader, it must have action centered in a well-defined plot, and characters of impelling, individual interest. If the story is to live and last for good, it must leave a wholesome effect in the mind and heart of the reader.
Practically all our best novels reveal, directly or indirectly, the influence of the Bible. This is particularly true of those that have won and held folk of varied classes through the years. Outwardly, this influence is shown in allusions, in lines of scripture, and in themes taken directly from Holy Writ. Inwardly, it is revealed by characters with admirable qualities and by the general tone and uplift of the story.
Spiritual growth in characters that
trayed. In Robinson Crusoe*, sometimes called the first of our novels, Defoe has the shipwrecked hero, alone on an island, tell simply and frankly of his forward steps from a life "without religious foundation at all" to one of abiding faith and devotion to God. His conversion began with finding, on the lonely isle, some growing grain like that he had known in his old homeland. Touched by the discovery, Crusoe felt it to be a gift from God. Later, opening the Bible he had saved from the wrecked ship, he found these lines, "Call on me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." Then he began to offer thanks for his food, and pray daily for protection and guidance. The Sabbath he had lost was restored to his calendar; and, finally, when the man Friday came into his life, Robinson Crusoe prayed for wisdom to bring the gospel light into the mind and heart of the poor slave.
Another classic novel created in later years, Silas Marner by George Eliot, portrays a similar bringing of a lost soul back into the light. It gives concrete meaning to the Biblical line, "A little child shall lead them." Shocked by the perfidy of a trusted companion, Silas had withdrawn from the world and sunk into bitterness. Then, robbed of his hoard of gold, he was plunged into utter despair, until golden-haired little Eppie came strangely into his home and heart. Gradually the little child led him back to a richer, more religious life.
*Studied in Relief Society Literature course, 1938-39; See Relief Society Magazine, August 1938, page 501; September 1938, page 634. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?DECEMBER 1945 Still another story, which has won and held the hearts of countless folk, is The Tale of Two Cities by Dickens. Its central theme may be found in these precious words of the Savior: "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." Sidney Carton makes this supreme sacrifice to save a friend, to protect the happiness of those he loves. And as he goes nobly to his death at the guillotine, these divine words sustain and comfort him: I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die (John 2: 25-26). In addition to the many novels which, like the last two named, have at heart a Biblical theme, there are others which more openly announce and portray such themes. One of these, classic in its qualities, is Ben Hur?A Tale of the Christ by Lew Wallace. With master stroke, the author brings back the life and times of the Savior. In Book I?a prelude ?we are brought closer to the story of the birth of the Savior, with vivid descriptions of the shepherds and other humble folk of Judea. We are also made to feel in the story of the Wise Men who followed the star to find the Christ Child, the depth and significance of the Messianic hope. In Book II, we first meet Ben Hur, a young Jew of high birth, and Messala, a young Roman. As children, the two had been playmates. Now, with different training, the one in Jerusalem, the other in Rome, they had reached young manhood with different ideals firmly set. A tragic accident brings the two into their first clash. Ben Hur, unjustly charged with trying to kill a Roman official, is condemned to be a galley slave. At the beginning of his trouble, he is given a first brief contact with Jesus of Nazareth. Crowded years that follow bring him?and the reader?close to dramatic events and scenes, not only on a galley ship, but in regal Rome, in Arabia, and finally back to Jerusalem, where Ben Hur at last finds his king, the Savior of mankind. Just one excerpt from this masterful novel can be given here to illustrate how the story of the Master is made to live again. After a portrayal of the life of the lowly shepherds of Judea, in person and in spirit, we can see one Of them on watch before the sheepfold on the Holy Night when Christ was born. Faithfully he performs his duty until midnight, then? His task was done; now for the dreamless sleep with which labor blesses its wearied children! He moved toward the fire, but paused; a light was breaking around him, soft and white, like the moon's. He waited breathlessly. The light deepened; things before invisible came to view.... A chill sharper than that of the frosty air?a chill of fear?smote him. He looked up; the stars were gone; the light became a splendor. Then in terror he cried, "Awake! Awake!" Up sprang the dogs, and howling ran away. The herds rushed together, bewildered. The men clambered to their feet, weapons in hand. "What is it?" they asked in one voice. "See!" cried the watchman, "the sky is on fire!" Suddenly the light became intolerably bright and they covered their eyes, and dropped upon their knees; then as their souls shrank with fear, they would have died had not a voice said unto them, ?Fear not!? And they listened. "Fear not: for behold I bring unto you good tidings of great joy, which shall be unto all people." For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Savior which is Christ the Lord."
This is just one author's way of bringing a dramatic event closer to us. As with different painters who have taken this and other Biblical subjects for portrayal, various writers make their different word pictures. Yet the basic scene remains ever the same.
Within more recent times, we have been given other novels based on the life of the Savior. One of these, The Robe by Lloyd Douglas, has lately won acclaim. Whether it will hold its present popularity remains to be seen. The story, told in more informal, more modern style than Ben Hur, still has many points of similarity with that earlier novel, particularly in its portrayal of Romans, Jews, and Greeks, who provide leading characters for the creative work.
In the Gospel of Saint John, the author found lines which touch the heart of the theme. "They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots" (John 19:24).
This robe, a simple, brown, homespun one, worn by the Savior when he was taken to be crucified, fell by lot to Marcellus, the Roman leader who had carried through the execution of Jesus. Unwillingly and drunkenly, he had performed as a soldier the cruel duty of crucifying one whom he felt was innocent. Later, at a banquet with icering Roman companions, Marcellus had donned the sacred robe. Suddenly something of ill came over him; he
watchful care of his servant Demetrius, he was taken here and there in the hope he might be restored to normal life again.
Among those with whom Marcellus was brought into contact, was the Greek Stephenos, or Stephen, who afterward became a martyr for the Christian faith. Stephen, shown the sacred robe, was touched into a train of memories of the Savior. "He wore it," said Stephen, "when he healed the sick and comforted the sorrowing . . . when he spoke to the multitudes as no man has ever spoken. He wore it when he wept by the cross to die?for me, a humble weaver! . . . and for you (Marcellus)?a wealthy Tribune!?and for you (Demetrius)?a slave."
Stephen went on to accuse Marcellus of the death of the Savior. Demetrius tried to stop the earnest Christian, but Marcellus commanded that Stephen proceed.
"You did not know what you were doing," he continued, "and you are sorry. . . You, Tribune Marcellus, can make amends for what you have done! He forgave you. I was there. . . . Make friends with him! He is alive! I have seen him! Marcellus did make friends with our Lord. He saw, unable to prevent it, the cruel stoning of Stephen, with the then unconverted, scornful Saul looking on. Through a series of such soul-shaping experiences and faith-promoting incidents, the Robe of Tribune was transformed and restored. At last he and his beloved wife Diana found life everlasting through their Savior and King.
Another outstanding recent novel, Joseph in Egypt by Thomas Mann, turns a masterpiece of the Bible to a vital purpose. RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?DECEMBER 1945 The story of Joseph, sold by his brothers, his life in Egypt in the rich historical and social setting of those long ago times, is portrayed. For the presentation of such a theme with telling effect, the Bible provides basic materials of dramatic cast. Through the more than two centuries since our first prose fiction began to appear, novel after novel, directly or indirectly linked with the Bible, has been printed. Naturally, most of these creations have had brief lives. Others, touching classic heights, have persisted through the years. Some short stories that have certainly won and held place in our hearts are: The Other Wise Man by Henry VanDyke; and A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens; "J" Valjean and the Bishop," from Les Miserables, by Victor Hugo; A Man Without a Country, by Edward Eve-ret Hale. All these stories in rhythmically beautiful prose, vibrate with true Christian spirit. Hundreds of other creations of like uplift and helpfulness have been created. Many of the stories make no outward mention of the Bible, yet in the actions and the words of the characters they lead the reader to admire and love, one feels true charity, brotherhood, honesty, virtue, and other qualities characteristic of the true follower of the Master. Added to these types of fictional stories, are many that are created just to give good cheer, to open our eyes to beautiful things in nature, to help us appreciate friends and even strangers who come into our midst. Such stories are in tune with the gospel of goodness and happiness. We need mental and spiritual sunshine to fit us for the sterner hours of life. What is required most is a cultivated sense of selection. Far too much of our fiction just preys upon unthinking folk with tales unfit to read?stories that are simply sensational pictures of perturbed lives ending in nothingness. Dissipation of time and precious emotional energy, rather than recreation, ls the main reward of such novels. **But," someone will ask, "how can a choice selection of fictional stories be made?" Here are a few simple tests that may prove helpful: 1. Does the novel ring true to life and true to truth? 2. Are its characters and its scenes and conversation such as might be introduced with uplift into the home circle? 3. Is it written in language that is both picturesque and rhythmic? Does it lend itself to oral reading? 4. Does it promote faith, courage, cheer, strength of character, practical Christianity? If the story in large measure brings these positive results for good, then it is Bible-inspired. Many of our great authors have acknowledged openly their indebtedness to the Bible; none more impressively than Sir Walter Scott. In the closing hours of his life, this great writer turned to a beloved friend with a request for a book. "Which book?" said the friend. "Need you ask," came the reply; "there is but one." Discussion and Activities 1. (a) What are the outward differences between a drama and a novel? How are they essentially alike? (b) What are some qualities that the play and the novel must have to make them worth time? 2. (a) Be ready to answer the roll call LESSON DEPARTMENT 777 of your class with the name of a novel whose title, theme, or spiritual qualities give evidence that it was Bible-inspired. (b) What type of novel, even though there may be no such evidence of its connection with the Bible, still may bring good into our lives? How? 3. (a) Give two reasons why we must cultivate in these days a better sense of selection for created stories, (b) Name one novel or short story which you are willing to defend as not only wholesome but interesting. 4. What is meant by this suggestion: Novels that live and last for most folk are factually sound, true to life, and spiritually wholesome. 5. What can be done to cultivate a taste for choice, wholesome stories?by the home; by the school; by the church? Think in this connection of the following suggestions: a?Voicing good literature round the fireside. B?Occasional "story hours" for home socials. C?Encouraging creative authorship in the schools. D?Co-operating with the librarian in providing choice books. Social Science Modern Applications of Moral Principles Lesson 12?Morals in Marriage and Family Relationships Dr. Harold T. Christensen For Tuesday, March 26, 1946 Lesson Link: Last month's discussion centered around some of the social and moral problems of modern woman. It was shown that the trend toward woman's emancipation has resulted in some confusion and considerable immorality, but that it may also mean a real opportunity for moral development. There have been tendencies on the part of many women to prostitute their sex for the sake of personal advantage, which is a betrayal of both equality and morality. Woman's power over man is profound, and because of this she is given the special responsibility of guarding and guiding the moral advance of all mankind. Lesson aim: To analyze our most basic social institution from the standpoint of moral conduct, listing some of the common faults, and pointing out some of the principles necessary for correction. MARRIAGE is the gateway to family life, and the family is the very hub of social existence. It is here that people are most intimate, most impressionable to the influence of others, and most happy when things are going well. It is here that character is formed. But, despite the fact that the family is the most primary and the most basic of all social institutions, it is in trouble; and one reason for this trouble is the moral degeneration spoken of in earlier lessons. Family stability depends upon moral integrity, and moral integrity depends upon family stability. The two are interrelated, and any deterioration in one will cause a breakdown in the other, which in turn will reinfect the first, so that the two will become locked in a vicious circle of decay and disorganization. And this is exactly what has been happening. For the sake of character we must preserve the family, and for the sake of the family we must preserve character. It is to this end that the present lesson is written.
Pre-Marriage Ethics
The period of boy-girl adjustments prior to marriage is usually spoken of as courtship. Here we have a whole series of experimental friendships, personality testings, and habit adjustments. The primary purpose of courtship is preparation for marriage; preparation through interchange, choice, and adjustment.
Since courtship is essentially a relationship involving two or more persons, it follows that this relationship in which the setting of each is forever kept in mind, and immoral where either one or both become selfish and exploitive in their attitudes and procedures. A successful date from the moral point of view is one that is mutually enriching. In order to save space we will forego any detailed analysis of this problem and will simply list, with brief comment, some of the most common deviations from moral courtship:
(1) Poor sportsmanship. Many young people are too immature and infantile in their behavior, too easily hurt, too quick to take offense. Instead of being broad-minded and considerate of their partner they remain unreasonably jealous and selfcentered; instead of respecting the personality and moral standards of the other, they coax, tease, banter, drink, or indulge in other ways.
Many young people are too selfish. They should take themselves less seriously, develop a sense of humor, and at all times be considerate.
(2) Discourtesy. Frequently, too, courtship is filled with the crudities and discourtesies that mark immaturity and selfishness in personality. Being loud or boisterous in public, slovenly or crude in dress or manners, profane or vulgar in conversation, means being cheap and offensive. Furthermore, bragging about other dates and flirting with others while on a date are extremely discourteous, as are also other means of embarrassing or offending the partner. Those who court should be more gentlemanly and ladylike than they sometimes are, more cultured and refined, more considerate, more courteous.
(3) Dishonesty. Some people seem to take pride in being a "man of many loves," in adding broken hearts to their score as the Indians used to add scalps to their belts. This, of course, is usually accomplished by insincere flattery (sometimes called "a line") along with dishonest behavior designed to lead the other person on. But it is wrong. The price of such deceit and betrayal is human sorrow as deep as any ever known. Love should not be treated as a plaything.
(4) Intimacy. The problem of unchastity was discussed in an earlier lesson, but there are intimacies short of that which also need attention. Kissing, embracing, and fondling are often indulged in for the sake of a passing thrill, or in order to "pay" for a date. Aside from the danger of lost control leading to "pay" for a date. Aside from the able experimentation often cheapens sex, spoils love, and conditions the participants against successful marriage. LESSON DEPARTMENT 779 Moderation, reserve, self-control, and above all the feeling of mutual responsibility, should supplant these widespread practices of reckless indulgences and selfish exploitations in the field of intimate conduct. There are other offenses against morality in courtship practice; "gold-digging," for example, and "going steady" for personal convenience without serious intent or with little concern for the consequences. But perhaps this is enough to illustrate and to show that selfishness, in no matter what form it may take, is basically immoral, for it corrodes our souls and brings sorrow to our loved ones. The Ethics of Family Relationships This is even more true in marriage than it is in courtship, for the relationship of marriage is so much more intimate, emotional, and continual. Upon entering marriage, each person makes certain pledges and accepts certain risks and responsibilities. Where the responsibilities are ignored and the pledges broken, as they often are, others are wronged and made to suffer. Marriage is a co-operative adventure and without co-operation it fails. Following are some of the common ways in which husband and wife sometimes wrong each other: (1) quarreling, nagging, and bickering continually; (2) holding grudges, bringing up the past, refusing to forgive; (3) bossing, taking unfair advantage, refusing to give in or admit you are wrong; (4) intimidating, belittling, or disparaging the mate in public; (5) sulking, crying, or having temper tantrums in order to get your own way; (6) using money, sex favors, or other power devices to control your partner or inveigle favors from him; (7) taking your mate for granted and making uncompensated demands for money, or favors; (8) expecting and demanding that love be continually demonstrated by sentimental expressions, expensive presents, and the like; (9) living a parasitic life? such as the wife sleeping until noon, leaving the house dirty spending most of her time in social clubs, et cetera; or the husband failing to provide, neglecting responsibility for the children, et cetera; (10) being dishonest and untrue by lying, "stepping out" on the mate, or even committing adultery; (11) taking marriage lightly, and then using divorce as a means of escape. The list is not complete, but it is suggestive. Lewis M. Terman, recently studied the marriage grievances of 792 couples and found, out of a list of fifty-seven grievances, the ten greatest for both husband and wife to be as follows, ranked in the order of their seriousness: Grievances of Husbands nags me not affectionate selfish and inconsiderate complains too much interferes with hobbies W. Slovenly in appearance W. Quick-tempered W. Interferes with my discipline W. Conceited W. Insincere Grievances of Wives H. Selfish and inconsiderate H. Unsuccessful in business H. Untruthful RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?DECEMBER 1945 H. Complains too much H. Does not show his affection H. Does not talk things over H, harsh with children H. Touchy H. No interest in children H. Not interested in home The great importance of a co-operative attitude and the spirit of fair play between husband and wife can easily be seen from this study. Where people selfishly, or even dishonestly, attempt to turn the privileges of marriage to their own advantage and to exploit other members of the family, love has gone arid marriage has failed. Only in the atmosphere of sacrifice, co-operation, and mutual enrichment can the love that was kindled in courtship endure and mature into a bond of eternal companionship. But the parent-child relationships in the family are equally important to those between husband and wife; in fact, from the point of view of character building and future morality, they are even more important. Here are some of the ways in which parents are sometimes unwise and unethical in their dealings with children: (1) setting poor examples for them, failing to realize that actions speak louder than words, leaving the home atmosphere clouded and soiled; (2) providing inadequate training and guidance, neglecting rather than protecting, failing to meet the needs of the children in sex education, permitting them to engage in unwholesome employment and/or leisure time activities; (3) bossing the children as if they were property, using discipline that is too harsh and cruel, not giving them enough rights and personality freedom; (4) rejecting their children, being hateful and antagonistic toward them, letting them starve for wan, t of love, affection, and emotional security; (5) over-protecting their children, pouring too much affection over them, giving them too many favors, spoiling them. This list also could be extended, but it is sufficient as it stands to illustrate. And here, too, the key to moral relationships is love, co-operation, helpfulness. Post-family Adjustments While the Latter-day Saint family ties are sealed for the eternities, family units, as such, do not remain intact in this life. There are essentially two processes in the changes which may come to a given family: (1) the process of children marrying and moving away, and (2) the process of death and widowhood. We will discuss each of these briefly in turn. The time of "the empty nest" is difficult for most parents to face and adjust to, for the struggles and satisfactions incident to child rearing have become a part of their lives and they quite naturally are reluctant to see them go. But though the reluctance is natural, any interference with this normal and inevitable process is unnatural, and likely to lead into trouble. Some parents make the mistake, consciously or unconsciously, of trying to hold on to their children at this time, spoiling them with affection and favors, or interfering with their courtship so that they won't marry and move away. The last or youngest child in the family is particularly susceptible to interference and spoiling of this sort. Sometimes parents, in their desire to hold on, will interfere and 
attempt to control the lives of their children and their children's families after marriage; and this, of course, is a calamity when it happens.
Still other parents, although successful in letting go of their children, will give up to melancholy and will pine away the rest of their lives in lonesomeness. All of these reactions are mistakes. Parents should plan for the time when they can be relieved of some of the responsibility of family care, so that when it comes they can fill their years full of interesting, creative activity. And parents should learn how to enjoy their children as adults, and their grandchildren and great-grandchildren as they come along. With a little better understanding and a little more effort, in-lay relationships could be much more pleasant and enriching than they are now.
Bereavement; and subsequent adjustment, after the death of a marriage partner is the common experience of nearly half of the married population. Since women live two or three years longer than men on the average, and usually marry men who are two or three years older than themselves to start with, there are many more widows than there are widowers. Statistically speaking, most women can expect to be a widow for four or five years of their lifetime.
It is wisdom, then, to expect this crisis; and by planning and preparing for it, to make it as easy and comfortable as possible. With proper forethought and thrift the financial hazard of widowhood can be largely eliminated. With an understanding of widowhood can appreciation of eternal life, the pe-
riod of mourning can be made considerably easier. While the memory of the deceased should be held in reverence, no good results from continuous mourning. There should come a time of optimism and cheerfulness when life will go on much as before. For the young, remarriage might be the best solution; for the old, memory, activity, and dreams for the future.
A Word About the Spinster
Approximately one-tenth of our adult population never marries, and many of these through no fault of their own. Generally speaking, the males who never marry are those who are disqualified on the basis of some defect (physical, mental, social, or moral); while, as a rule, the females that remain single are those of intellect and ability who have not been willing to take any man that came along in order to marry, or who have made themselves less attractive to the opposite sex. They have waited too long by entering a career or going on for higher education. World War II, with the delays and the casualties it involves, will mean that even more older and high calibered women will never have the opportunity of marriage.
While the bachelor has adjustment problems as well as does the spinster, it is the unmarried girl who presents the biggest social and moral problem. She is less independent; more the victim of circumstances, and more sensitive to her condition than is the male. And what is more, she usually has higher character and is in a better position to influence the character of others.
RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE?DECEMBER 1945 Another outstanding recent restlessness, resentment, failure, inferiority, frustration, and defeat that the spinster so often experiences are enough sometimes to disorganize her personality and cause her to turn antisocial. She has a sense of loneliness and isolation that somehow keeps her apart from the rest of society, and often, too, she is a target for social ridicule. No wonder so many become nervous, irritable, sour; no wonder a few become psychopathic, homosexual, criminalistic. Fortunately, they are not all like this; a great many are entirely successful in turning their emotional and material drives into other channels, in living happy lives, and in making real contributions to society. But all who are required by circumstances to remain single should be helped to realize that marriage is only a part of life and that, though it is a very desirable part, if it can't be realized, life does not need to lose its meaning nor purpose because of the fact. Social work, nursing, school teaching, or similar work can help substitute for motherhood and in this way happiness can be found and life's purposes fulfilled. Adjustment can be made, and in a moral way. And Finally In concluding this lesson let it be said again that world morality depends quite basically upon marriage and family stability, and that family stability in turn depends fundamentally upon morality. It is the atmosphere or climate of the home that shapes the characters of men, and it is of such things as honesty, responsibility, and love that this climate is composed. Problems for Thought and Action Note: In treating the pre-marriage, marriage and post-marriage, and unmarried stages or phases of family phenomena, this lesson is rather long. If the class leader finds too much material here for one period it might be well to choose that part of the lesson that most closely fits the age and marital status of most class members, and then focus on that. 1. Show how morals and family stability are interrelated. 2. Consider the four points discussed under "Pre-marriage Ethics," give examples of each, and discuss the various moral implications. Can you name other types of unethical behavior in courtship? Why is selfishness so much a part of them all? 3. Do the same for the various points under "The Ethics of Family Relationships" as you did in problem 2 above. What significance does Terman's study have to the problem of morale and happiness in marriage? Discuss. Show why co-operation is important in parent-child relationships as well as in those between husband and wife. 4. How does the reluctance on the part of parents to have an "empty nest" explain their occasional interference in the courtship of younger children and sometimes in the married lives of other children? Show why this is a mistake. How can parents be happy in old age after the children have gone? Why are there so many more widows than widowers? Make helpful suggestions on the problem of adjusting to widowhood. 5. What percentage of the adult population never marries? Why are spinsters usually of a higher quality than bachelors? Why is the problem of the unmarried woman more serious than that of the unmarried man? Name some of the most common adjustment problems of the spinster and make suggestions for solving them.

Now I've learned to curb my tongue, my violent wants and wishes. Can it be I'm all alone with memories?and dishes? PEACE Christie Lund Coles Christmas Day These who have walked in ravaged, war-torn places, Have known the quivering fear, the aching sense Of insecurity, the blanched, wan faces, The futility of man's bitter defense Against his fellow. They know at last That this dark, troubled path is not the way The heart of man would go. Searching the past, He seeks the miracle recalled today. He seeks the answer and the soft echo Of the hope long hid in his mind's keeping: These bells of Christmas ringing through the snow, The story told again to a world, weeping; The promise by the herald angels spoken-Peace for each searching soul, each heart broken. What is Peace? What is the peace the star led men toward. Over the silent land, the greening hill. Where shepherds watched and quiet night, deep-starred, Knew yet another luminous star, to fill The earth with light and herald angels' song; That brought his life to stand against a world Consuming itself by its iniquity. Peace must be nurtured in the human heart Where his great love and mercy planted it, Must grow as man grows, man's must be the part To make reality of holy writ, That he may speak again, still promising That love is all and some day shall be king.
