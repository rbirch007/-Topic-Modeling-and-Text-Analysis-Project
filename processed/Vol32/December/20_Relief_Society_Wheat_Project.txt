Relief Society Wheat Project Elder Joseph L. Wirthlin Second Counselor, Presiding Bishopric THERE is no question but what I should like to talk to you for a you sisters have missed a great moment about a project in which many things in not being able to at you are vitally interested, namely, tend the sessions of the general the wheat storage project which conference during the past four originated in the days of President years, but I should like you to know Brigham Young when he counseled that we have missed you very much, the members of the Relief Society and we are happy that you are back, to store wheat against a day of need. If we were to continue attending In that day of long ago, the sisters general conference without our sis of the Relief Society went out into the fields after the brethren had harvested the crops and literally gleaned what was left, and from that day on until 1919, the sisters of the Relief Society had been accumulating wheat which eventually amounted to thousands of bushels. The Federal Government, in 1919, proposed the purchase of this wheat, and it was sold to the Government for the sum of approximately $400,000. With the approval of the First Presidency, the money was placed in trust in the Presiding Bishop's office with the understanding that this money would be invested in such a way as to insure its safety and return some interest. Over the years the interest has been paid to the Relief Societies of the Church, who in turn have used it for maternity and child welfare work. But about four years ago, the First Presidency deemed it advisable to invest the money again in wheat to the end that should there come a day of need, some provision would be made to provide for the members of the Church. Hence, a large elevator was erected on Welfare Square with welfare labor, which holds approximately 250,000 bushels of wheat. A small elevator was purchased at Levan, Utah, and another one at McCammon, Idaho. The recently purchased flour mill at Kaysville has an additional storage capacity of 72,000 bushels. At the present time the Relief Society has stored in the Salt Lake Elevator and the one at Levan approximately 215,000 bushels of wheat which has a value at the present market price of over $200,000, and there is a sizable amount of the original wheat funds that has not yet been invested in wheat.
As we contemplate this achievement by the women of the Church, the effort required, it represents to
all of us a grand and glorious achievement. More than that, it represents the principle of generosity and willingness to provide the staff of life for any members of the Church who might be in need. It is further evidence of the divine power that inspires men and women to do those things which are for the spiritual and temporal benefit of the Church.
AND now as you approach a new project in the way of a building for the women of the Church, there will be no question about your success and the final accomplishment of your objective. No doubt when this building project gets underway, the brethren of the Church will be given the privilege to contribute to the fund that will cover the cost of the building as an expression of appreciation and gratitude for the splendid service rendered by this great organization of women.
My mother was a Relief Society president. I say, "God bless her for her devoted service," for out of the service rendered in this great organization, she set her children an example which instilled in their hearts a love for the gospel of Jesus Christ. When I think of these ministering angels of the Relief Society, the words of the song just rendered express best the spirit in which they labor: "Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you, not as the world gives, give I unto you." The spirit of the Master motivates this great organization of our sisters to render a service which causes all of us to say, "God bless them."
May God bless you in all of your endeavors, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent December 1, and December 15, 1885 "For the Rights of the Women of Zion and the Rights of the Women of All Nations" ADVICE TO MOTHERS: Mothers, and those who have the care of young children and infants, should remember to be in school themselves every day of their lives, for even the infant imbibes the spirit of her who attends it day by day and hour by hour; delicacy and refinement should guard every action, for, be assured, the plastic soul will bear the impress given! Language, also, should ever be guarded, that no words or exclamations may fall upon the infant ear, but that which is sweet, harmonious, and loving.... You, young mothers, remember day by day and hour by hour the mighty responsibility that rests upon you.... Devote, at least, the next twenty years to maturing and educating your children; this will be to you the finest school on earth.?Hannah T. King. CHRISTMAS: Christmas approaches, and as the merry season draws near, our thoughts revert to a period... When the Eternal Son of God, the mighty Savior of the world, condescended to become the babe of Bethlehem, and descend below all things, that He might bring about the great scheme of redemption, and open up the way whereby a fallen world could be restored to the presence of the Father... He came unto his own, and his own received him not.... Then, when another Christmas day dawns upon the earth, let us remember the Holy One who has again restored the Gospel to the earth... Let us as Latter-day Saints, seek after the spirit of Him whose birth we celebrate, and strive to do the works that He did.... In this way we shall ourselves receive a blessing, and give to all a happy Christmas.? Phebe C. Young. WINTER: Winter at last is here in pomp and magnificence; it has ushered itself in. The beautiful carpet of grass has been replaced by one of pure white snow.... Who does not love, as in the evening they are seated before a cosy fire, to hear the wild winds of winter first coming like a low, moaning whisper, then louder, shriller, and more fierce.... Again, who does not love to view the trees on a clear frosty morning; they stand forth draped in their pure white robes of snow.... All, all in loveliness.... I thank God that I have been given an appreciative mind to enjoy all this loveliness of nature.?Ida. A CHRISTMAS PRAYER Enlighten, comfort, sanctify my heart, Sweeten my temper and subdue my will. I want to bring my sisters to thy throne, I want to love and honor Christ alone, I want to feel the spirit's inward power. And stand prepared for death's important hour.  I want to do whatever God requires, I want a heart to burn with pure desires. Lead me through life to glorify thy grace, And after death to see Thee face to face. -M. A. Greenhalgh Page 756
