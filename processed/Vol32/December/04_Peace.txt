peace we've won Have joy and sadness been so finely spun. II Our hearts must all be purged of anger now; For he who was a child in Nazareth, As bright with life as is a fruited bough. Was born to rid the earth of hate and death. We have a world to heal, much to forgive. And much to learn of nations brought so near By war's rough hand that now no peoples live Remote as neighbors lived on our frontier. By love of neighbor we may prove our worth; The angels' chorus had a double theme? "Good will toward men" as well as 'peace on earth." Oh, let no bitterness obstruct our dream! This Christmas time, snow-clean and winter-pearled, Let lasting peace link men around the world. The Cover: "Madonna of the Chair" by Raphael. (Copyright, 1926, by Eugene A. Perry.
