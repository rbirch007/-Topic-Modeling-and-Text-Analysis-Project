Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, October 1, and October 15, 1885 "For the Rights of the Women of Zion and the Rights of the Women OF All Nations" GIRLS, DON'T MISTAKE BRASS FOR GOLD: The bestowal of the affections of a woman is a strange subject, perhaps, to dilate upon, but one which, in my estimation, should be dwelt upon and discussed far more than it has hitherto been, for by the bestowal may come joy and happiness, or woe and heartache. Who would wish for shadow when she could have sunshine?... Then why should we not be more wise and discreet in the choice of a husband, when, by the selection, may come life-long sorrow, tears, and wishes for an early grave.... Then we should be careful not to mistake brass for gold... To be sure that we have the real, genuine metal; then we are more confident of happiness. Ida. RESPONSE Love on! Love on! In life's maturer age, When time with iron pen fills up the page, O'er which we sigh and often drop the tear. As scenes are shifting by us year by year.  Hannah T. King  SCENES AND INCIDENTS AT WINTER QUARTERS: Lately, in looking over some old papers, I found a letter of exhortation and counsel to father's family.... Itis dated August 22nd, 1846, my eighteenth birthday, and had been preserved among father's papers: Now I shall require these things at your hands... Cease from vanity, seek humility and meekness, bow before the Lord in the morning and at eve, and in so doing your days may be many, peace and tranquility shall soothe your bosoms, health and happiness shall dwell in thy wagons, tents, wigwams and cottages, while these things are observed. Cease from murmuring or complaining, finding fault with your friend or with each other, but manifest to all men and women, by your works and the closeness of your tongues, and the integrity of your hearts, that you are right, and that God is with us of a truth. I always do, and shall expect that those which constitute my house, will remember me before the Lord, that I may have wisdom, health, patience, endurance... That I may always give suitable counsel to my family. Heber C. Kimball.  Helen Mar (Kimball) Whitney. A GOOD TESTIMONY: Fault-finding does not enhance our peace of mind, and it almost invariably disturbs that of those we most desire to promote. If we wish to be loved and trusted, then let us love and trust in return; and be sure that the best and truest way of pure happiness is to suffer wrong rather than do wrong Violet Owens. Page 600
