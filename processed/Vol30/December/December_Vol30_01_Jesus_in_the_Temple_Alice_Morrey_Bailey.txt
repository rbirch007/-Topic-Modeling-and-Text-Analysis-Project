JESUS IN THE TEMPLE Alice Morrey Bailey
There is no record that they loved this child Those doctors in the temple, ancients learned Nor if, scarce twelve, His mind divinely turned To knowledge of the Kingdom, He beguiled Their wits; how much His reverent manner, mild Yet eager, fearless of their censure, earned Their high regard; nor if their hearts discerned His purity and goodness undefiled.
There is no evidence His lightning thought Illumined them, nor that they grasped as breath Of life, His wordsthough always men have sought The truth, long dead in books, the shibboleth That sprang to life upon His lipshave fought To pierce the dark and secret folds of death.
And could savants, by lettered paragon Detect the Spirit's power? How could they know This was their Kingwhose precious blood would flow For them, the Prince of Peace, the only One Whose life could conquer deaththe Holy Son Of God? And that His sacred words would grow To fill the earth?Foretell the deeds that sow Divinity in men were now begun?
Nor could His parents, when they came, distraught With fear for dangers, ills, that lurk Wherever men abide. His words were fraught With wisdom older than their ownthe irk They felt dispelling: Wist ye not That I must be about my Father's work?
