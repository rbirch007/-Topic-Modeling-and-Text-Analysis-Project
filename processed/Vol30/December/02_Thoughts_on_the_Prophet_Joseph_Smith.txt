Thoughts on the Prophet Joseph Smith Elder A. William Lund Assistant Church Historian
On December 23, 1943, we celebrate the 138th anniversary of the birth of Joseph Smith, a Prophet of our Lord. The history of this good man, especially during the years from 1820 to 1844, is one of the most interesting stories ever told. Space will not permit of details but only a few thoughts concerning him. However, in this short period of time and in the face of all kinds of persecution, Joseph Smith accomplished a great work which still is a "marvelous work and a wonder."
In the fifteenth year of his life the different religious sects, in his home town, were holding revival meetings. Joseph, being of a religious nature, attended these meetings with a desire to know which sect he should join. As each of these denominations taught different doctrines and each claimed to be right, his mind was confused at their claims. Being a reader of the Bible he read the words of the Apostle James: "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him."
These words so impressed the young man that he went into a wood where, in the humility of his soul, he poured out his heart in prayer to God that He would show him which church to join. This humble prayer was answered by the most glorious vision shown to man.
This boy saw two Personages, the glory of whom defied all description, standing above him. One of these persons, pointing to the other, said: "This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!" Joseph was told to join none of the churches for "they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof."
When this young man told of his vision, he was laughed at and made light of but he answered: "I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it."
Through this vision the young man revealed anew to the world the truth that God is a personal being and that Jesus Christ is His Son and is a personal being, separate from the Father.
A few years passed and Joseph Smith, desiring to know what his standing was before the Lord, sought the Lord in humble prayer. In answer to this prayer an angel, named Moroni, was sent to give further instruction to this young man and to tell him where a sacred record of the early inhabitants of America was hidden. Also the angel told him that "when these things begin to be known, that is, when it is known that the Lord has shown you these things, the workers of iniquity will seek your overthrow; they will circulate falsehoods to destroy your reputation, and also will seek to take your life; but remember this if you are faithful, and shall hereafter continue to keep the commandments of the Lord, you shall be preserved to bring these things forth."
This statement of the angel was literally fulfilled. When Joseph Smith received the plates he had to use every plan he could think of to keep the plates from falling into the hands of the enemy. Through his faithfulness, even though he was hindered in every way, he published to the world this record known as the Book of Mormon.
The angel also told him "that the knowledge which this record contains will go to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people under the whole heaven." Here again is a prediction made to Joseph Smith before the record was printed, yet it, too, has been fulfilled. The Book of Mormon has been published in eighteen different languages and by means of the radio the knowledge it contains has been broadcast throughout the world.
The angel further said, speaking of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, "when they are interpreted, the Lord will give the holy priesthood to some, and they shall begin to proclaim this Gospel and baptize by water, and after that they shall have power to give the Holy Ghost by the laying on of their hands. Then will persecution rage more and more."
The Priesthood was bestowed upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. On May 15, 1829, these two men received the Aaronic Priesthood from John the Baptist, and a short time later received the Melchizedek Priesthood under the hands of Peter, James and John, apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ. After this Priesthood was restored and men were given the authority to perform the ordinances necessary to obtain eternal life, greater and more severe persecution was heaped upon Joseph Smith and his followers.
The angel also said to Joseph Smith: "Your name shall be known among the nations, for the work which the Lord will perform by your hands shall cause the righteous to rejoice and the wicked to rage: with the one it shall be had in honour, and with the other in reproach." This statement made to this young, unknown man has had its literal fulfillment. Throughout the whole world his name is held in loving reverence by all his followersin honor and respect by his friends, and in reproach by his enemies.
At the time when the vision of the Father and His Son was given to Joseph Smith, when the Book of Mormon was brought forth and when the Priesthood of God was restored, there was no church upon the face of the earth, with all its learning, that understood or taught the doctrines of Jesus Christ, our Savior. This young man, without fear, but as the humble servant of God, gave to the world the true ordinances and doctrines of the Lord. He, under direct commandment, organized the Church of Jesus Christ with the same offices that the Lord Himself set up in His Church to bring all to the unity of the faith.
The Prophet affirmed that faith in the Lord, repentance from sin, baptism by immersion for the remission of sin, and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands were absolutely essential to our salvation and necessary to enter Christ's Church. Joseph Smith also pointed out that all ordinances of the Gospel of our Lord must be performed by one having authority from God.
He taught that we all were the children of God and that our spirits were the offspring of our Eternal Father and that we lived with Him before we came upon this earth and had our spirits clothed upon with mortality. He preached that as Jesus Christ arose from the dead that we all should arise from the dead, and that this resurrection would be the re-uniting of our spirit with our body, even in the same manner that the resurrection of our Savior was a re-uniting of His spirit with His body. Also, he taught that after the resurrection the body and spirit could never again be separated.
He explained that the Gospel of Jesus Christ was the power of God unto salvation to everyone of our Father's children; that all those who had died, or who would yet die, who had not the chance to hear the Gospel, would be given that chance, that the ordinances necessary for the salvation of the living would be given to those who were dead by living persons acting as proxy for the dead persons; that our dear Lord gave His life thus doing a vicarious work for us that we could not do for ourselves, and that our Lord opened the way for the Gospel to be preached to the dead as His spirit preached to the dead while His body lay in the tomb. In fact, Joseph Smith taught all the principles and ordinances taught by our Lord as necessary to everlasting life.
While restoring to the earth the fulness of the Gospel, receiving and publishing revelations from God, and establishing the Relief Society and other helps for his followers, Joseph Smith also showed himself as a remarkable leader in the temporal affairs of his people. He helped choose sites for cities and helped in their building. In the building of the Kirtland and Nauvoo temples he helped dig the excavations and also took part at the pinery to cut timber for them. The welfare of his people was always near to his heart; this is shown by the following story related of him by Brother Andrew Workman, of Virgin City, Washington County, Utah:
"I was born in Bourbon County, Kentucky, July 15th, 1824. Joined the Church in Overton County, Tennessee, March, 1842. I saw the Prophet Joseph for the first time in May of the same year. He was with about a dozen others on the stand in a meeting. I knew him as soon as I saw him. Although I was young I knew him to be a man of God. A few days after this I was at Joseph's house; he was there, and several men were sitting on the fence. Joseph came out and spoke to us all. Pretty soon a man came up and said that a poor brother who lived out some distance from town had had his house burned down the night before. Nearly all of the men said they felt sorry for the man. Joseph put his hand in his pocket, took out five dollars and said, 'I feel sorry for this brother to the amount of five dollars; how much do you all feel sorry?'"
When Commerce, later named Nauvoo, was purchased, the place was very swampy and he personally supervised its draining. He advised the best plants, shrubbery, and (Continued on page 744)
