Christmas on Tubuai in 1851 Nettie Hunt Rencher
My grandmother, Louisa Barnes Pratt, was the first woman to be called to fill a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In conference in Salt Lake City on the 6th of April, 1850, she received her call. When President Brigham Young set her apart for this work, he made her many wonderful promises which were literally fulfilled. Her mission was to the women and children of the South Sea Islands. She and her family of four daughters left Salt Lake City on the 7th of May, 1850, in company with ten missionaries, some of whom took their families. Louisa's husband, Addison Pratt, had preceded her eight months before. She made the long journey of one thousand miles by land, and five thousand miles by water in safety, as she had been promised. Five and a half months being required to make the journey. Her eldest daughter, a young lady nearly nineteen years of age, learned the language very easily, and acted as interpreter for her mother until she had mastered the language. Being born and reared in Massachusetts, Louisa had a splendid education for that day and time. She had taught school in the States, in Canada, Nauvoo, Winter Quarters, and Salt Lake City, and was now to continue her teaching in the Islands. She did a great work among the women and children of Tubuai, where she spent most of her time. She kept a journal a good deal of her life, and all the time while on her mission, the first entries being made more than one hundred years ago. It is from this journal that the story of "Christmas on Tubuai in 1851" is taken, given in her own words:
When Christmas was drawing near, I called the Native Sisters around me and told them of the nearing event. We had taught them of the Savior's life and mission. I told them we would have a big celebration, and of course a great feast, as no affair was complete without a feast. They were all very much pleased. First I told them we must clean the large room used for church services, or angels would not minister unto us, for they take no delight in filth. So we took sand and scoured the benches and floor, to the delight of the native women who had not witnessed anything of the kind before. Now began our decorating. In the center of the room was a large pillar supporting the roof. On either side I placed an ito tree, of the most livid green, extending almost to the roof; to these I attached tea leaves, of which the females make wreaths because of their bright color, and pleasant odor. Added to these the bright fresh flowers of the bouran tree scattered about among the branches forming a pleasing contrast of lively green and yellow. Overhead and around the entire room, I hung boughs, flowers and branches of the lime tree with the fruit on. I had with me a picture of the Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum; these I hung on the wall. The native Saints regard them with great reverence. Then we invited our Church members and intimate friends. The natives gathered from far and near; thronged around the house, looking in at the windows, admiring the decorations. I felt annoyed and asked the chief to send them away. He plead for them, as a father would for children, saying they had never seen anything like it before. Would I not indulge them this once, next time they should be sent (Continued on page 760)
