The Resurrection Oscar W. McConkie "HE is not here, but is risen" (Luke 24:6), were words spoken by angels to "the women... Which came with him from Galilee," for they had "followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment." (Luke 23:55, 56) "Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them. And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre. And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments: And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?" (Luke 24: 1-5) Then the heavenly messengers testified that Jesus had come forth from the dead. And they saw "the place where the Lord lay." The interrogatory: "If a man die, shall he live again?" was answered. "For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so" was "'the Son of Man" "three days and three nights in the heart of the earth." (Matt. 12:40) He was "raised again the third day." "And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into Page 232 the holy city, and appeared unto many." (Matt. 27:52, 53) OB knew that Jesus would come forth from the dead, and that he would see him face to face. Isaiah said that all the dead would arise with their bodies, and Daniel foretold a classification of them into everlasting happiness or contempt. And all of the prophets witnessed it. Jesus himself said that he would conquer death. Paul wrote: "Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not. For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming. Then THE RESURRECTION cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom of God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power. For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death." (I Cor. 15:12-26) HE doctrine of the resurrection was plainly understood in the Meridian of Time. Jesus said: "But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee." (Mark 14:28) To the Sadducees, who did not believe in the resurrection, he affirmed the correctness of the doctrine, and said that after the resurrection men could die no more, for they would be "the children of the resurrection." The doctrine gives hope to all who love the Lord, for all men, whether good or bad, will be "recompensed at the resurrection." But "Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the Kingdom of God." (Luke 14:15) For esus said that all~ "shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation." (John 5:29) Therefore, all good men have just cause to hope. But exact justice cannot be administered independent of God, for perfection is not found amongst men. In the resurrection it is different. All will have a true reward. God will administer justice there, and His judgment and His laws are perfect. His execution of penalties, and His rewards and punishments are perfect. Because He is perfect, all men may hope for perfect rewards, whether good or evil, in the resurrection. Strange 233 things reach the ears of administrators of earthly affairs, and emotions that are shaped and controlled by many forces and prejudices enter into judgments here. But perfection will reign supreme in the resurrection. Many who rule here will be ruled over, there. Some lords will be abased. The meek will possess the earth. There is great cause for the righteous to look forward with hope, and to rejoice. But the wicked will have reason to mourn. Victory is made sure through Christ. His death and resurrection make life a profitable enterprise. Without them, death would be permanent, but the atoning plan removes the sting of death. It robs the grave of permanency. It leaves death and hell empty of all who serve the Lord with whole hearts. That it might be so, God raised up Jesus, to turn the children of men from their iniquities. But they were grieved at His doctrines, and demanded that He be killed. However, God raised Him from the dead, and extended through Him His mercy to all men. And assurance thereof is given to all who listen to the truth. So "Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?" (Acts 26:8) Many have suffered torture, and all manner of sorrow, and have denied themselves of every carnal pleasure, that they might have deliverance through a better resurrection. And they have blessed God, because of His abundant mercy, and have witnessed of Jesus, and have worshipped according to their highest knowledge,. That they might have part in the first resurrection. Upon 234 such the second death shall have no power, and their names will be found written in the book of life. ",. And I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. 'This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years." (Rev. 20:4-6) "And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works." (Rev. 20:12-13) Now, the books that were opened were the Scriptures, as well as the records of the Church. The Scriptures contain the law that will judge the whole earth. And all facts and records of the Church -will be measured and judged by them. 'They contain the law pertaining to the whole plan of salvation. The peoples of the earth must answer to them in the day of judgment. And the people of all dispensations will be judged out of whatever Scriptures were available to their respective generations. And the book of life is God's record of all life. 'The names of all men whom He created were in it. But the names of many will be blotted out, because of sin. "And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire." (Rev. 20:15) As to death and hell, the prophets speak of the grave as death, and the place of the consigned spirit as hell. The grave (death) will deliver up the body, and hell will deliver up the spirit, and the two will be joined in the resurrection, never more to be separated. HEN Jesus was born into the world, it was a mighty peace proclamation. The angels heralded His coming with songs and joy. A new star appeared, and good will went out from the presence of God. But the resurrection was of a different nature. It is true that it was a necessary event precedent to the peace of the soul, but in another sense, it was a pronouncement of the world's greatest victory. It was the most spectacular thing that ever happened in the world. It was greater than the creation of the earth, and of the bringing of its elements together. Jewish priests, teachers, and rabbis represented the priestly order of that day. They interpreted and administered the ecclesiastical law. The priesthood of the whole earth was in their hands. Therefore, they represented the ecclesiastical law of the earth. And the seat of civil law and authority was at Rome. Rome's arms _ stretched far, and dominated many people. Both ecclesiastical and THE RESURRECTION civil authority of the Meridian of Time united in judgment against Jesus, and determined that He should die. They judged and pronounced sentence upon Him. And the whole force of wickedness was arrayed against Him. All evil opposed Him. Lucifer, who represented every evil force in the whole earth, concentrated all of his powers against Jesus. 'Thus, all wickedness, and all wicked men, were arrayed against Him. These united to destroy His life. They succeeded because He allowed it to be so. And He suffered death in the manner devised by them, being judged of men. The law could not restore Him alive, for death reigned supreme. But He triumphed over the ecclesiastical law; over their civil law; over Lucifer, and over all his powers; and over wicked men; and over death and hell; and over all things. He came forth triumphantly. It was a victory greater than all victories. It was a victory worthy of God. None but Jesus Christ could do it. THEREFORE, "Why are ye troubled?" and "Why do thoughts arise in your hearts?" Jesus Christ has atoned for all men, and for all life, and the vital fact of the resurrection is proved. 'The mercy of 235 Chirst has established life. He is "the resurrection, and the life" and "he that believeth" in Him, "though he were dead, yet shall he live." And this probationary state is a time fixed for men to prepare to meet God, and to choose between the resurrections provided for them. It is the time to forsake all carnality, and to shake off the chains of sin. And all men ought to rejoice in Christ, without whom "there could have been no redemption," nor any resurrection, therefore, no victory. But blessed are the dead who sleep in peace, for their redemption is sure, because of the merciful plan of our Creator, who prepared a way for our deliverance. Our hope is renewed, because of the power of the resurrection, and all things will be restored, but "Do not suppose, because it has been spoken concerning restoration, that ye shall be restored from sin to happiness. Behold, I say unto you, wickedness never was happiness." (Alma 41:10) "For that which ye do send out shall return unto you again, and be restored; therefore, the word restoration more fully condemneth the sinner, and justifieth him not at all." (Alma 41:15) But all will come forth. "If they be good, to the resurrection of everlasting life; and if they be evil, to the resurrection of damnation." (III Nephi 26:5) +
