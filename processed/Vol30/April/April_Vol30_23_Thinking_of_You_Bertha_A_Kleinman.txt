THINKING OF YOU Bertha A. Kleiuman To the mother whose arms have never pressed A baby's head to her lonely breast, To the mother whose lips have never sung A lullaby in a baby's tongue, To the mother whose prayers through time and space Have seemed to fail at the Throne of Grace No plea, no prayer, no tears of thine Are ever wasted in God's design, For He who counteth the sparrow's fall Eternal increase shall yield to all, And the motherhood that is here denied Shall yet be given and glorified! RACHEL RIDGWAY IVINS GRANT 297 oo RIDGWAY IVINS GRANT (Continued from page 231) months' journey, the persistent cough which troubled her had entirely disappeared. Though she had minor colds at later intervals, she was never again bothered with any serious lung trouble up to the time of her death. It was the tenth day of August, 1853, when Israel Ivins, tired but happy, drove into Salt Lake and stopped before the comfortable home of his friend, Jedediah M. Grant, on Main Street. Brother Grant immediately set about to make the little family comfortable, and lost no time in bringing them into the house where they were invited to stay for a short time while planning for the immediate future.

It is the highest, holiest service to be assumed by mankind. It places her who honors its holy calling and service next to the angels. To you mothers in Israel we say God bless and protect you, and give you the strength and courage, the faith and knowledge, the > <> holy love and consecration to duty, that shall enable you to fill to the fullest measure the sacred calling which is yours. My prayer tonight is that the Lord will bless us and help us always to understand where our duty lies, and aid us to do that duty and to do it well. AN ADEQUATE DAILY DIET (Continued from page 291) Planning meals is interesting or boresome exactly in proportion to the amount of thought and effort you put into it. Careless cooking, indifferent seasoning, and unattractive service will do much to discourage the "fussy eater"; while a pleasing color plan, having green, yellow, red, and white in the meal; contrasting textures, a crispy crunchy food to balance the soft creamy one; contrasting temperatures such as hot soup, cold salad; and variation in shape, a square of meat loaf and a mound of mashed potatoes, will help to make the family like and eat the great variety of fine food we Americans have. 3 PACKAGES 25 BENNETT GLASS & PAINT CO.
