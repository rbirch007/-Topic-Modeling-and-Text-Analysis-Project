he fails to find an ever-recurring thrill in the practical fruits of sound religion and correct living so abundant on every hand in town and hamlet here "in the tops of the mountains!" Well-ordered homes and farms, thriving communities, men and women of good will; what finer vindication of the principles our western pioneers strove so earnestly to perpetuate by just such agencies as the Relief Society! Fair-dealing, the maintenance of ethical standards, also are by-products of those principles. As printers and binders we believe we have "kept the faith' in all dealings with our clients. We shall continue to do so.

The Cover
"LE BENEDICITE" by Jean Baptiste Simeon Chardin, 1699-1773, in the Louvre, Paris, is the subject of the cover for the April issue of the Magazine. Alone among French artists of his day, Chardin considered simple home life as a worthy theme for his paintings. As a painter of the middle class' and of domestic interiors Chardin has few equals. The artist has caught the moment in the serving of the meal when the small child is being helped over a difficult word as she says grace. The scene is tenderly and sympathetically portrayed. Chardin was born the son of a cabinetmaker. Under his master, Aved, he gained something of his teacher's enthusiasm for the art of the Dutch painters. He was admitted to the Academy at the age of twenty-nine by which time he had earned renown with his genre scenes. In 1755 he was made Treasurer of the Academy which salaried position he held until his death.

Mother "THE following excerpt is from a letter written by a son in the Navy to his mother. "Your letters are always welcome indeed. I! Appreciate them even if | am slow in answering them. Even though I do not always write to you | think of you every day, yes, several times a day. You have always been so good and kind and understanding with me and Albert, 1 want you to know how much | appreciate what you have done for us. Both you and Dad have taught by example much better than anyone else has by words. "It is not easy for me to speak of my innermost feelings but now I am old enough to know that to tell one who is near and dear to you that you love her very much is nothing to be ashamed of. I do love you very much and it is this love for you that has kept me from many temptations. It is a love that grows in a son when he can see in his mother what he would like to see in other women. A beauty of character and personality; a great deal of courage and patience in times of hardship; a wealth of understanding for the sufferings of others, and most of all a deep and abiding faith in God. These are all the things that I want to find in the girl that I take as my companion in this life. "You taught me to love honesty because you love honesty. You taught me to love God because you loved God. Yourlove. Of clean living made me love clean living. Your faith in me has given me faith in myself. I cannot help feeling your great love for me and I hope that you may feel the love I have for you. My love cannot be as great because through service to me your love has grown and become greater. In a like manner the more I do for you the more deep is my affection for you.... "Herbert Dickson." CAI Ps) a] @) A a a = eo) ~< 3 Q 5 | VOL. 30, NO. 4 MAGAZINE v
