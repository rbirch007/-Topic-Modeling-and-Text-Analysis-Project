AMERICAN HUSBAND Eva Willes Wangsgaard Now he was back, and she could have her say; Too many times he'd treated her that way. Man-like, he'd gone to see a softball game, Though there were twenty chores that she could name That needed doing round the house and yard. The earth about the shrubs was packed too hard For woman hands to loosen, and the grass On all three lawns was just a tangled mass. No use to try to tell him, for he read The news and didn't hear a word she said, Or else he listened to the radio. How he could stand the noise, she didn't know; But if she went to tell him what she thought, She'd find him soundly sleeping, like as not, She'd turn that racket off. This time he'd. Hear. So she went rushing inbut a quick fear Caught at her hair and twisted in a chill All down her back. He sat there, slumped and still, With no more movement in him than a rock; And she stood, racked and empty with the shock, And all her angry words congealed in her. Quickly she reached out for his wrist. A stir, A rasping snore, and breathing was resumed. Blessed life! It was not what she'd assumed. And with returning rhythm, calm and deep, Her fear thinned, and she stood and watched him sleep. In every sagging muscle, pale but sure, Fatigue had stamped a lasting signature. It struck her with the suddenness of breath, Some day she might stand face to face with death. Then she could see, like stones upon him there, The separate weights of all he had to bear Not only money cares that daily drew A wall around him as the children grew, But fine intangibles she could not name Like loyalty and faith, which stayed the same Whether their lives ran. Smooth as grass or rough As shag. His side of life showed plain enough So she felt shamed and knew her grumbling mean. A man must have some letup from routine. What canon gave her right to criticize? She dabbed an apron corner at her eyes. Affection rose and smothered out her fear, And even his faults seemed rare and strangely dear.
