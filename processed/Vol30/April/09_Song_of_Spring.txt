SONG OF SPRING this intimate contact with the good earth. And as our gardens put out rich growth and show signs of abundant, maturing crops, we achieve a peace, a serenity, and a sure contentment. No matter what the crop, be it 257 roses or cabbages, the gardenmaker who tends and ministers to his plants in this age-old fashion, receives a certain deep and abiding reward, a gain which is physical, spiritual, and mental, such as the casual gardener seldom knows. SONG OF SPRING Mabel Jones Gabbott Today it's spring, and in my soul I know God lives. Today I know, I did not doubt when autumn winds Swept bare my trees. When sleeping winter's frost Lay at. My door, I kept my faith. But when, today, spring's greening figures Touched my heart and beckoned me To frolic in the pale new sun, I longed to shout: "He lives, I know He lives. I know. I know." His smile has touched the tiny shoots That struggle through the cool rich earth, To stretch their yellow heads towards the sun, And drink of green ambrosial strength. His love has summoned every bluebird's song, And turned the robin's merry note To happiness and joy. His tenderness has lingered in my apple tree And wakened dormant buds to fragrant life. His understanding cheer, has called The little children forth in happy glee To drink the fresh spring air, And toss their ropes, and play their games. His goodness fills my soul. I stand in silence, worshipfully still. In spring, God seems so near. And all within my little world is right.
