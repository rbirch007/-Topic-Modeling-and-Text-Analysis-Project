Halfway is not Enough Vaunee T. Larson THIS is our street, Betty," Glen Williams informed his wife as he turned their car from Main onto Vine Maple. "And our house for the next few months, or-at least as long as I'm a special agent for Uncle Sam, is the last one down." The car crept along that Betty might see the surroundings of their new home. "'A little white cottage covered with roses," Betty said dreamily. "What a dear little place." She glanced eagerly about her. "And how friendly all the houses look on this street." She and Glen had been married only a few months and to move into a distant strange community was an exciting experience for her. "I don't think I'll mind being so far from Utah after all. Now tell me who lives in each one." 'That I don't know, Dear." "Glen Williams, you mean you've lived here two whole weeks and don't know the names of any of our neighbors?" Betty demanded incredulously. "Well, Honey, I spent the first day finding this place, and after that my time's been taken up with my work and writing letters to my lovely wife telling her how much I missed her," Glen replied easily. "Besides, who am I that the neighborhood ladies should be trooping over to call on me?" "You're just about the nicest husband in the whole world and I think the neighborhood ladies made a great mistake in not visiting you firsthand and finding that out," Betty said impudently. "Til wager you'll soon be acquainted with all of them," Glen said, "and then you can tell me all the news." Before Glen turned off the motor Betty was out of the car and bounding up the walk as happy as a youngster. Inside she observed instantly that with the addition of the few vases and pictures which she had thoughtfully packed, this "furnished" house would be as livable and lovable a home as any they could desire. She whisked an apron from her traveling bag and began to prepare a tasty dinner for her husband, singing merrily the whole time. Maybe the neighbor ladies had slighted her husband by not offering him a fresh piece of pie, or a piece of cake, or some cookies, but she would soon remedy that she mused, as she thought of all his favorite dishes. She was a "born" cook just like her mother. As she prepared a fruit salad, she thought of the delicacies she had seen her mother make and distribute to the sick, or needy, or to strangers. On the few occasions when there had been sickness in her family always some of the good sisters had brought in food, or come in to do the work. These same women had been the first to welcome the strangers moving in, so that they had invariably exclaimed. "Why this is the friendliest place we've ever lived." Page 281 282 BETTY was a fast worker and within a few days the little house was wearing freshly laundered curtains over its sparkling glass panes. She had scrubbed it from the basement to the tiny attic. Glen had protested all her work on it, but she had said, "Oh, there's nothing like cleaning a house to really make it one's own. Besides, when the neighborhood ladies come to call I want to have everything spick and span. Seems as if they should be coming to see me soon," she added thoughtfully. "T wouldn't worry about it, Betty. Don't you imagine they've seen you cleaning and wished to wait until you were all through?" "Yes, of course, that's why," Betty said. However, the days lengthened into a weck and the weeks into almost a month and still no callers came. Betty's spirit drooped and she lost some of her zest for her new home. Not in the evenings. With Glen at home they were perfect. They worked in their Victory Garden, or they sat and talked or read, or listened to an especially nice musical program on the radio. It was the daytime hours that were so interminably long with Glen gone from eight in the morning until six at night. Sometimes in the daytime she was so overcome with loneliness and homesickness it was difficult to restrain her tears. She doubted if Glen would understand her feeling as he had been a missionary in a foreign land and had early developed a selfsustaining spirit which she had always admired, so she said nothing to him. After she gave way to such feelings of loneliness, she mentally lashed herself for seeming to lack a pioneer spirit. Goodness, what if she really had hardships to bear such as countless women in this war were facing with fortitude. After such thoughts she would dry her tears and go outside and putter with the flowers. Whenever she saw Mrs. Beemer, her elderly neighbor, in her yard or garden she went to the fence and tried to engage her in conversation. Mrs. Beemer answered pleasantly enough but if Betty only smiled and said nothing, Mrs. Beemer nodded and retired to her own house. Then there was Mrs. Boyden in  the next house down the street. Betty often saw her pass by but she only called a brisk greeting or waved her hand. In the house across the street lived the young Kelleys and their first baby. Laverne Kelley had seemed friendly enough the few times they had talked across the street. She had told Betty she was so busy with Baby Bobby she didn't know when she'd have time to call, but for Betty to come to see her. ONE bright afternoon that seemed just right for a friendly chat, Betty donned a fresh linen dress and crossed the street to Laverne's. As she went up the walk she saw Laverne peep out of the window; then, unmistakably, she heard her pattering hurriedly to and fro, probably whisking her room in order. Betty paused and admired the flowers blooming along the walk in order that Laverne wouldn't be too flustered when she arrived. Just as Betty lightly knocked on the door, Bobby started to cry. Betty had timed her visit at the hour when HALFWAY IS NOT ENOUGH she thought he was normally napping. Laverne did not answer her knock, and Betty was debating whether to open the door and boldly call, or go home, when Laverne appeared with the screaming baby in her arms. "Oh, dear, I think he must be cutting a tooth. He seldom ever cries like this. Come in, won't you? You'll have to excuse the way my house looks. I've been so busy with washing and ironing for Bobby. A baby is an awful lot of work sometimes." Betty felt sorry for her. She looked so hot and tired. "Here, let me take the baby," she offered. "I'd love to hold him." "No, he might muss you up. Besides he's crying so." Betty's visit wasn't much of a success. In a short while she left with the feeling that it was a relief to. Laverne to be alone with her baby. When she got home she. Could no longer keep back her bitter tears. Well, there was only one thing left to do and that was to get a job. She could type or clerk in a store. Anything to alleviate her utter loneliness would be welcomed. HAT night at dinner while eating fluffy biscuits and new peas, she told Glen of her intention. "But, Honey, you know Dr. Knowlton said distinctly you were to get lots of rest, and fresh air, and sunshine for at least a year, in order for you to be a mother to some healthy youngsters of ours." "Yes, I realize that Glen, and I know I'm being just awfully selfish but I guess I'm just homesick and longing to have some feminine companionship. I've tried so hard to get 283 to know our neighbors and I just can't." Glen tried to comfort her in his clumsy masculine way. He loved her so dearly it was a grief to him to know she was unhappy. "Maybe we could arrange a trip home for you, Betty. How would you like that?" "Well, of course I would like it, Dear, but absolutely not without you. We don't know how much longer we can be together anyway, and I'm staying with you. Besides everything's perfect when you're here." She managed a shaky smile. "There, I was a big baby and let's forget all about it." She got up quickly and made a great to-do clearing the table and washing the dishes. But Glen didn't forget about it. He pretended to read the evening paper while he was pondering the situation. "T have it, Honey," he declared suddenly. Betty looked up from the socks she was darning. "Why not have a little party?" "A patty?" Betty looked at him blankly. "Pray tell me whom would J invite, Mr. Williams?" "Why Mrs. Beemer, and Mrs. Boyden, and Mrs. Kelley, and Bobby." "Glen, you're teasing me. Why I've already gone halfway with those people." "T'm serious, Betty, honest," and as she still looked doubtful he continued, "Where do you think our ~ Church would be now if our missionaries just went halfway? Plenty of times the missionaries have had to go all the way alone and it's been a tough fight, too. They've met rebuffs and abuse, but by persistence 284 they've been amply rewarded with investigators and even converts." "Yes, Glen, but what has that to do with me? I'm not a missionary. I'm just a housewife who would like to get acquainted with her neighbors." "Betty, I believe we're all missionaries. And any friend you can win for yourself can eventually be a friend of our Church." Betty was thoughtful for a moment. "How true that sounds, Glen." With determination she added, "I will invite them." She finished her mending, then she busied herself with her notepaper. "I'll make it Thursday afternoon at 2:30. I've noticed Mrs. Boyden is always home on that day." She wrote informal notes inviting them to bring their sewing. Glen walked to the post office with her. They strolled arm-in-arm and Betty thought she had never seen the stars look brighter, "If things don't work out for the best, maybe you can take on a job of some kind." Glen said, then added quickly, "That's just to show you how certain I am your party will be a success." Betty looked forward eagerly to the afternoon of the party. There was fruit punch in the refrigerator and dainty cookies on her silver plate. At twenty to three no one had come. She heard steps on the porch and quickly went to the door, but it was only the postman' with a new magazine. She took it and sat in the easy chair to wait, when the doorbell rang and there was Mrs. Beemer. Laverne and Mrs. Boyden were coming up the walk together. Trt night when Glen arrived home, Betty met him at the door and lifted her face for his kiss. "Well, how was the party?" he. Asked confidently, seeing her shining face. "Darling, it worked out just as you said." Betty kept up her chatter as Glen hung up his coat and hat, and stretched out on the divan for a few minutes' relaxation. "You know why Mrs. Beemer hasn't ever visited over the fence with me? Well, she said once there'd been an awtully 'refined' teacher who lived here, they only hired her for a year, but she made some remark about Mrs. Beemer's atrocious English and Mrs. Beemer said she was afraid I'd think her terrible if she got 'was' and 'were' mixed up, and words like that. When I told her how my grand- * father only got through the third grade because he had to help out at home, and that it wasn't a person's English that counted with me, she timidly asked me if 'd mind helping her study a grammar book she has." "Why, that's wonderful, Betty," Glen interrupted his wife. "But you've only heard part of it. Mrs. Boyden wanted to know who knitted the dress I'm wearing, and when I said I did she just about hugged me, and asked me to help her with some sweaters she's knitting for the Red Cross. She's in charge of it, and it's hard to find expert knitters who have the time. 'Then she's going to take me with her once a week to make bandages and dressings down at the Center. Why, Glen she's just doing so mucli war work it makes me ashamed of myself. They have two sons overseas, too." Betty continued enthusiastically. HALFWAY IS NOT ENOUGH "And Laverne had such a big basket of mending with her. She said she hadn't intended to bring it all but didn't have time to sort out her thread and so on. Well, we all pitched in and did it for her, and she was so grateful she almost cried. She said she just couldn't get all her work done and Bobby taken care of too. I asked her if she would let me care for him at least an hour every nice day and wheel him to the park, I'm going to do it tomorrow morning. She was so pleased -with the suggestion, and thinks she can missionary husband." 285 accomplish a great part of her work then." As an afterthought Betty added, "They liked my cookies, too, and wanted the recipe." "Which all goes to prove, Mrs. Williams?" Glen suggested with a smile.... "That from now on I'll always rely on the wisdom and judgment of my "So how about some...?" "Dinner." Betty laughingly finished the sentence as she tripped off to the kitchen with a light step. AFTER SPRINGTIME RAIN Beatrice E. Linford Bright jewels clinging trembling to the eaves Shimmering on the edge of emerald leaves, Aglow in purple mist of lilac spray, And pinkish cloud of blooming almonds gay. All colors of the garden are renewed, Washed bright and clean, refreshed, with life imbued. Soft drip drop of the jewels upon the ground Scarce audible because of sweet, sweet sound Of robins singing gladly after rain, The bluebird's happy musical refrain. How lovely is the shining springtime rain Causing the earth to glow with life again.
