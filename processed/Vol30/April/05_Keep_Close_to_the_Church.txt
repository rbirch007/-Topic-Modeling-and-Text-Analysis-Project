Keep Close to the Church Dr. Edgar B. Brossard Member United States Tariff Commission close to the Church and its teachings, is God's command. Obedience to this admonition will establish proper values and objectives for life's work, and will contribute to man's greatest joy and satisfaction. Keeping this counsel and demonstrating its fruits will aid others to obtain for themselves the same consequent blessings. Abiding by it will thus strengthen us and the Church and make for better living standards the world over. Compliance with it will provide salvation and exaltation in the life hereafter. The authorities, ancient and present, have stressed the necessity of our active affiliation with the Church and of the practical application of its doctrine in our lives. We are taught to "remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy," to "go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day"; that it is good to meet together often to renew our covenants and to study the Gospel; that we should bear our testimonies to each other often because that will strengthen our faith and make it easier to keep it, and to live as we should. The exhortations of the Old and New Testaments, the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants, the teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith and of all the leaders of the Church since then, resound in one chorusseek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened; keep the commandments and you Page 240 Shall know whether they are of God; the race is not to the swift nor to the strong but to them who endure to the end; keep close to the Church and the Lord will bless you with the strength of ten. 'The Gospel is God's plan of life and salvation for His family, the human family. The Church is His organization providing opportunities for its fulfillment. In the love and wisdom of an all-seeing Father, He has marked our course through life and back to our eternal home. His plan is so unlimited in scope and so marvelous in comprehension that it inspires mankind to hope, even for perfection. And His Church through the Priesthood, wards, stakes, missions, the Relief: Society, Sunday School, Primary, Mutuals, scouting, choirs, Genealogical Societies, and temple work, offers the means of achieving this glorious objective. THE past twenty years in Church, Government, and other work in Washington dealing with representatives of domestic and foreign industries, agriculture, labor, and governments of many nations has shown anew the great present value of the Church and has emphasized the mission it has to perform throughout the world. That mission, if possible, is even more vital now than heretofore. Present conditions would be quite different if just the homely and simple virtue of absolute and forthright honesty were KEEP CLOSE TO THE CHURCH 241 MEMBERS OF WASHINGTON STAKE IN MILITARY SERVICE HONORED Washington Stake Conference, September 1942. Center, left to right: President Oscar A. Kirkham, President Ezra T. Benson, and President Hugh B. Brown. Practiced among men. Open honesty that declared "the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth," would make negotiating treaties, trade agreements, and all other international dealings easier - and the results more enduring. What a heaven on earth it would be if all the high standards of the Church were adhered to by mankind generally in all their relations with each other, and if men acted knowing that what they did, had not only a fleeting, but an eternal effect. Nearly ten years ago when President Heber J. Grant, both his counselors, and five members of the Quorum of the Twelve came to Washington to dedicate the new chapel they told us over and over again that they hoped we would make full use of it. "Take good care of it, yes. It is new, bright, and lovely, and is beautifully furnished, but it was built and equipped to be used." Ever since the day of its opening, it has been used effectively in preaching the Gospel and keeping members active in the Church. Besides the full program of regular Church services as a ward and stake house, 180,000 visitors have come to the chapel to enjoy a restful hour of music and a conducted tour of the building, and have sent back word to their families and friends in all parts of the country. With the capital city mobilized for war, the 1600 242 SERVICE MEN ENTERTAINED, 1942 Home of Bishop and Sister Harold G, Clark tourists per month have given way to as many defense workers and temporary residents who turn to the "Mormon Chapel" for respite and new inspiration. A third of these guests remain for an hour or more in gospel conversation with the stake missionaries, while uncounted others come to Sunday services and M. I. A. To see "Mormons-in-action." The fifty service men who find a restful night's lodging in the clean, airy gymnasium each Saturday night can attest to the building being used and its conventions respected. Elder D. Sterling Wheelwright, as organist, chapel director, and in charge of the Bureau of Information is, with his talented wife, doing a magnificent missionary service. Excepting the Salt Lake Tabernacle, organ, choir, and Temple grounds, this is the greatest center of missionary activities in the Church. Its influence is world-wide because of its character, and because it emanates from the Capital of the United States of America where are located diplomatic representatives of every important nation on earth. N recent years there has been a vast movement of members of the Church from the former center stakes in the valleys of the Rockies to hunt new opportunities in all parts of the United States, east, west, north and south, and to many foreign countries. Hundreds have come to Washington, D. C. To work in the Government, attend the universities, establish business, practice law, medicine, dentistry, teach school, be with their children, or' other loved ones, and for various other purposes. The membership in the Washington Ward is a regular moving cavalcade. It changes so rapidly that it is an exacting job to keep ward records up to date under such conditions. The genius of the Church is shown in the way it inspires members to give their time and do the necessary work to meet such problems. Because so many of those who come to the Nation's Capital have continued active in the Church, this group has grown from a mere handful, meeting in Senator Reed Smoot's home, to a good size stake of 3,000 menabert That whole period of change and growth is replete with evidence of the blessings that have come to those who have kept close to the Church. And now, during the past two years, thousands of our young men KEEP CLOSE TO THE CHURCH and women have joined the armed and auxiliary forces of our nation, and are to be found in all parts of the world where those forces are on duty, or training for activity in the various services. Hundreds of them have come to Washington and nearby areas. These young people are away from home, many of them for the first time. They are away from family and friends and from their familiar and stabilized Church and home-town social and economic conditions. They are often engaged in strange and unloved, and sometimes difficult and dangerous tasks that are necessary for the protection of our country and our way of life. These men and women especially should contact the Church at every possible point in their travels to partake of the sacrament and renew their covenants with the Lord. They will learn more of the Gospel, strengthen their faith, draw nearer to God, obtain courage to resist temptation, and become stronger in character and endurance to carry on under any and all conditions the vicissitudes of their tasks and living conditions. Many of the testimonies now borne in our Washington fast meetings are those of such visiting service men and women from nearby bases. Their thrilling, faith-promoting experiences, and their expressed need and love for keeping close to the Church is a tribute to the homes and wards all over the Church from which they come. A_ lieutenant colonel in the Army Air Corps, a member of the Church whose wife had been baptized during their few months stay in Washington, said conversions were not made through 243 prayer and study alone, but also by the warm friendliness which radiates through our churches and personal associations. A young marine paid great tribute to his brother's fidelity to the Church. He said in coming to Washington he was eager to find his brother, also in the service, who had expected to be here about that time. He had no means of knowing where to locate him, but he knew it he were here, when Sunday came he would find him at Sunday School. And so he did. These fine young men are all enlisted in teaching and appreciating 'the Restored Gospel as well as in the service of their country, and through prayer and right living they can keep close to the Lord wherever their service may take them. A COMMENDABLE practice of the families of the various wards of Washington, by arrangement of the stake military committee, is to invite all service men visiting the Washington Chapel Sunday School to have dinner in the homes. Many of these men find relatives and friends at Church; however, from six to twenty others each Sunday have dinner with families who have especially prepared for them. The men enjoy this respite from camp life and the host families enjoy having them, as is shown by this report of Sister Leah Ivins Cardon: It was a never-to-be-forgotten experience. From the time they entered our front door and our son burst into the kitchen exclaiming, "Mom, let's do this every Sunday," until the last one left in the evening, it was a thrill. There were twenty of them, soldiers, sailors, and marines. To see them greet each other and us, to meet other Westerners, other 244 Mormons, people who knew their home country and perhaps knew some of their friends, brought a light to their faces which I shall never forget. And I agreed with my young son when he said, on one of his many trips to the kitchen to replenish the hot rolls plate, "Mom, a religion that can produce a bunch of men like this has got something." I am looking forward to having them again, only next time I shall make ten dozen rolls instead of five, Each family entertaining also writes a note of greeting and appreciation to the parents of the men. The replies received from these anxious parents, happy in their sons being able to attend church and find home friends, would warm the heart of anyone. In this spirit of loving fellowship the work of God goes forward and men and women in all wards and branches are thus keeping close to the Church. EVEN in places where there are no Church organizations, we may enjoy religious blessings of a substantial character. Through secret prayer everyone may enjoy close and intimate communion with God and obtain the unrivalled fruits thereof. Members may send tithing to their bishops each pay day and keep the Word of Wisdom, and thus keep a very tangible association with the Church through compliance with these important commandments of the Lord. Think of our radio, telephone, telegraph, and mailing facilities for keeping close to the Church. In the days of our Savior, only those in the vicinity where He ministered even heard His name. Today, the sermons of His servants and our great Tabernacle organ and choir may be heard around the world. Church literature and the timely and inspired current messages of the First Presidency are readily available to even the remotest parts. Finally, there is no substitute nor alternative for keeping close to the Church and its teachings. It encompasses the real joys and satisfactions of life. May God help us to ever keep the Gospel standards before us in all our transactions with Him. And with our fellowmen, and help each to do his small part in building up His Church and Kingdom here upon the earth. G. And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day; 10. For verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and to pay thy devotions unto the Most High; 11. Nevertheless thy vows shall be offered up in righteousness on all days and at all times; 12. But remember that on this, the Lord's day, thou shalt offer thine oblations and thy sacraments unto the Most High, confessing thy sins unto thy brethren, and before the Lord.Doctrine and Covenants, Section 59.
