Ideals and Responsibilities
Elder Milton Bennion General Superintendent of the Deseret Sunday School Union
THE perpetuation of the race is a major social purpose of the family. This is universally recognized by thinking people everywhere. The Latter-day Saints accept this but in a much more impressive and far-reaching way than do any other people; this because of their belief in the eternity of the family relationship and the eternal progress of man.
Sexual purity, while long and widely recognized as an ideal, and even among some primitive tribes enforced by severe penalties for its violation, receives a new and much more sacred sanction in the teachings of the Latter-day Saints. Parents are, of course, strictly bound, themselves, to practice chastity in the proper meaning of that term. With this as a foundation, they are religiously obligated to develop in their children the highest ideals of family life and sex relations. This calls for understanding not only of the nature of children and youths in general, but also for careful study of the nature of each child for whose moral and religious education the parents are primarily responsible. This responsibility cannot be shifted to any other agency. The Church and the school should, of course, supplement the educational efforts of the family, and the civic community should do its best to build favorable and eliminate unfavorable influences for the proper moral development of children and youths. It is a great mistake, however, to assume that they, individually or collectively, can relieve the family of its responsibility. One of the tragedies of the war situation is that some mothers, either for what they conceive to be patriotic reasons or for The CoverLake McDonald, Glacier National Park. Photo by Hileman.

One of the greatest dangers to our country, viewed through the generations, is the character demoralization of her future citizens. Without strength, purity, and integrity of character on the part of citizens generally, there can be no national security or achievement worth saving. ' 'In the training of children, emphasis should always be on the positive side. Wholesome pleasures and stimulation of ambition for service and high achievement may be supplemented at opportune times and circumstances by warnings against temptations to take a downward course, but even this may be done with youth in such a way as to lead them to picture in imagination the dire consequence of evil practices. When a youth pictures vividly to himself the consequence of indulging his appetites or passions contrary to the teachings of the Church, it will have far more weight with him than will mere dogmatic teaching or parental commands, although under some circumstances this method may be necessary, especially with children. Even they, however, are generally more able to think and to understand more than most adults give them credit for. 'They should be given a chance to think and to make some decisions for themselves. Parents should, of course, see that the children are led to revise wrong decisions and never to act upon judgments that may be morally or religiously detrimental either to themselves or to others. Arbitrary commands on the part of parents sometimes have the reverse effect of that anticipated. This may be true of attendance at religious gatherings. Sometimes, attempts to force youth in these matters may lead to deception or rebellion and sometimes to hatred of the obligations that parents attempt to force upon them. Even when, out of respect for parents, they yield to the parental admonition, they sometimes cease the activity as soon as parental authority is outgrown. A teacher in Ancient Greece is credited with saying that it was his business to teach boys to love the right. 'That is a primary obligation of parents toward their children. Until they acquire a love of the right and the habit of acting upon that love as a motive, their characters will be imperfectly formed.
