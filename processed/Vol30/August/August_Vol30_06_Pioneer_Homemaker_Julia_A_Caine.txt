Pioneer Homemaker Julia A. Caine A NEW world was opened in 1803 to the expanding Americans who were pushing beyond the western hills. All life seemed to revolve around new ideas and dreams of homes to the west of the broad Mississippi. Word of the great purchase was carried into the isolated hamlets of New Hampshire by postrider, and here men gathered on street corners and talked of moving to the new country, Louisiana, the land beyond the Mississippi. While excitement was at its height in the town of Hillsborough, New Hampshire, a baby girl was born who was to traverse that great territory far into the west and was to establish the first home in the Great Basin. The tiny baby, Harriet Page Wheeler, cared little for her father's talk of the great Napoleon, Indians, and Lewis and Clarke, but these ideas were everyday conversation in the little home, and the West held a promise of adventure as she grew up in New England. Her own home was the typical frontier house of the small settlements where the family was taught to do all things needed for its comfort. She learned to weave her own clothes, trim her own hats, and cook for the family. At the age of sixteen, she was ready for a real adventure in the fabulous West. School teachers were scarce in those days, and a seventeen-year-old gitl who could teach reading, writing, and arithmetic might easily get a position in the familiar little schoolhouse. Harriet packed her Page 464 Caine trunk and set forth for western New York where friends had secured her the job of schoolmarm at Phelps. The young teacher had a school attended by children of all ages. She was very dignified as she listened to the primer class sing their alphabet and as she helped the older students with their fractions. Indian stories in the old readers were her special delight and she must have dreamed often of a land even farther west then frontier New York. The schoolmarm boarded around in the village, went sleigh riding, and made friends with everyone. One of the town's young men soon became her constant companion and eventually, upon becoming the wife of Isaac Decker, Phelps became her home. But America was moving west, and any move to a new frontier held out golden promise. The Deckers joined this moving throng, and finally came to settle in the Ohio country where land was cheap. At New Portage, their home was the typical frontier dwelling. Each morning the family was up at 5 o'clock and breakfast was eaten by lamp light. The boys aided their father in the barnyard, the girls helped with the household tasks, and soon learned to weave, bake bread, and sew. The browneyed Harriet was building her frontier home as her people before her had builded in New England. "TRAVELERS were few in this land of little hamlets, and the family welcomed a preacher who A PIONEER HOMEMAKER talked of wonderful things that had happened in New York State. How the tired housewife must have enjoyed hearing 'of rivers and hills so near to her old home in Phelps. The wandering preacher was asked to return and the family began to read the books he discussed. They had attended many revival meetings in the past, but this man talked of a new religion that followed the old teaching of the Biblea religion of joy and promise. Here happiness was the keynote. He spoke of a gathering of his people to the West. Soon the Decker family gathered their belongings, joined the Latterday Saint Church, and moved west to Franklin, Ohio, near Kirtland, the home of many Latter-day Saint people. They joined wholeheartedly with their new companions, and, when the Church was in need of funds, the father of this little family gave his entire savings to help his people. Like all Latter-day Saint families, this family was looked upon with distrust by non-Mormon neighbors, who soon began to avoid them. What courage it must have taken to join with other Latter-day Saints and leave for the far Missouri! The turbulent Westerners in Missouri hated the quiet industry of this people who built towns so quickly on the best river lands. Many of the early settlers had come to the frontier either to procure large slave holdings or because they did not fit into the orderly society of the East. Mormon homes grew too rapidly into settlements. Frontier Missouri finally succeeded in driving the Mormons out. So back across Missouri moved the 465 tired little band, and in 1841 they settled on land at a bend of the Mississippi River, later to be known as Nauvoo the Beautiful. Here the well-built houses and shaded streets brought memories of New England. The Decker family now hoped that they had found a permanent home. Yet, even now, the little dwelling was not secure. Isaac Decker had tired of the continual moving and no longer felt enthusiastic for the society that shut him apart from other companions, and so he and his wife, whose whole soul was dominated by religious fervor, parted. Later, she married Lorenzo D. Young and made a pleasant home on the bank of the Mississippi. When the terrible months of persecution came and the Prophet-leader was killed, mobs threatened the beautiful Nauvoo, and Harriet was one of the first to make preparations to move to the West. HE broad Mississippi was frozen as the wagons waited in front of the little home on that cold February day in 1846. The children climbed inside; Lorenzo Young helped his wife into the wagon, and they turned toward the river. Across the ice and on to the Missouri moved the people, trusting in their leaders, who were men of God, to lead them to a new home. When the early spring of 1847 came, Winter Quarters, the temporary resting place of the Saints, was a bustle of activity. Songs of the West rang out and there was talk of California. There was. Also talk of missions to the Indians and how even now the elders of the Church were preaching to the Lamanites. 466 Definite plans were made for a small company to go farther west and to find a home for the people. Harriet's husband was chosen a member of this party. Harriet, suffering from maleria, begged to be taken with them. Brigham Young yielded to Lorenzo and Harriet's desire and agreed to let her go. Two other women also went with this band of scouts over the mountains to find a refuge and a home. 'They were Clara Decker Young, wife of Brigham Young and daughter of Harriet, and Ellen S. Kimball, wife of Heber C. Kimball. Two children accompanied Harriet. On April 7, the heavily loaded wagons started the long trek west. Seeds, plows, chickens, pigs, and cows made the caravan a picturesque sight. Each night the wagons formed a circle with interlocking wheels into which the cattle were driven. Each evening the women cooked over the campfire. Songs were sung around the fires which awakened echoes on the Platte River that had previously known only the whoop of Indian braves or the more riotous songs of the fortune seeker. Each morning this band of pioneers was up at five o'clock and by seven the train was moving on toward the Rockies. Rafts were built to ford the streams as the band pushed west. In late July the pioneers crossed the South Pass where eleven years earlier Narcissa Whitman had kneeled in thanksgiving for the right to carry the white man's Book to the Indians; but the path of these pioneers lay to the south. The Oregon had become the destination for too many traders and homeseekers. Soon the wagons crossed the rug ged Uintahs and wound down nartow Echo Canyon, where boulders and brush made it hard going for the wagons. The men had to cut a trail; rocks had to be moved. When the turn was made into East Canyon, the way seemed almost impassable. 'The canyon itself was steep; wolves lurked in the underbrush, and rattlesnakes lay in wait for the unwary. The crooked stream was willow-fringed, and rocks made the frequent crossings very slow and precarious. Everywhere huge peaks towered, and the July sun beat upon the toiling men as they tried to clear a way. At last Big Mountain was reached, and from its summit they glimpsed a broad valley which lay over yet another mountain. This must be the place Bridger had told of! This was the valley Goodyear had described. They hoped it was better than the traders had pictured. Now the little band rallied its strength, and by midday, Brigham Young and his brother Lorenzo and their wives were on the benchland east of the Great Salt Lake Valley. The broad stretches of treeless country shimmered in the heat. The women looked over their new home; a lizard ran across the foot of Harriet. She was tired. No house, grass or trees rested her weary eyes. She heard Brigham Young say, "This is the place," and she burst into tears. THE journey had been hard and now this! The sage brush, the sunflowers, nothing looked like home to her as she cried, "Lorenzo, we have traveled fifteen hundred miles over prairies, deserts, and mountains, but feeble as I am, I would rather journey A PIONEER HOMEMAKER a thousand miles farther than stay in this desolate place." But this was to be home. Lorenzo immediately plowed a small tract of land, onto which the water from City Creek was diverted, and he planted the first potatoes in the valley. The day following the entrance into the valley, a strange little assembly gathered, and a little band of worshippers thanked God for their new home. 'They were advised to make a fort for protection, and the next day the work of planting and home building began. At first Harriet's house was in the log and adobe fort, but this was so different from her usual home that she was very unhappy. Her new baby, who had been born in September, fretted in the mud-roofed cabin, and all the houses were so close together that Harriet lacked the privacy she craved. She was a home builder, and stockade life was disagreeable to her. In December, therefore, Lorenzo completed a log cabin of his own outside the fort some distance away. The other members protested at this move because of the danger of Indians, but Harriet thought only of homemaking. Even after an unfriendly Indian did invade her cabin 467 one day, she still refused to leave. It was in January, as she rocked her baby, that the rude savage invaded the little house and demanded "biscuit." Through a ruse, she loosed her watchdog, a powerful mastiff tied in the next room, and took the bow and arrows away from the Indian who had been wounded by the dog. Then, binding up the shoulder of the sullen native, she sent him on his way, and continued her life outside the fort. Spring had hardly arrived before the beauty-loving Harriet was hard at work making her house a home. She had brought the first children into the little settlement. Her son was the first white boy to be born in the Valley. Now she began to plan her home. Lorenzo brought a small locust tree from the mountains, and Harriet planted it in the front of her house. This was the first tree planted in the Valley. Her yard was the present yard of the Bee Hive House. This intrepid woman had dreamed of the great West, but always as a place of homes. She realized that dream as she planted trees and gardens. Men may plan cities, but women build homes. Salt Lake City is a city of homes and trees, and Harriet Wheeler Young was its original homemaker. MY WANTS. Roberta Bates I only want a little house, A lilac tree beside the door. A house with windows clean and bright, And sunlight dancing on the floor To the lilting music of childish laughter; A hearth whereon a kettle sings; Some birds to nest in the lilac tree, And a patch of sky to try their wings. Food Preservation Edna K. Ward HERE are several methods 'of "preserving" the home food supply of fresh fruits and vegetables during the summer growing season. 'To know that no fruits nor vegetables have been wasted, and to have an adequate winter supply of these important foods will be a great satisfaction to all homemakers. Latter-day Saint housewives have always been interested in preserving the summer supply of fruits and vegetables for winter use, and have practiced the adage of "waste not, want not." Vegetables and fruits may be preserved by canning, drying, freezing, and storing. It is the purpose of the following discussion to explain briefly the last three methods. DRYING Drying or dehydration of fruits and vegetables means that enough water is removed to stop the growth of molds and other organisms. If done properly, it will also preserve much of the flavor, color, and food value. Dried products occupy less space for storing. Drying Vegetables 1. Select vegetables that have reached the table-use stage. 2. Clean thoroughly, remove all blemishes. 3. Precook or steam. This prevents excessive loss of food value, sets the color, and hastens drying. Steaming is preferable to boiling in water. Any large kettle in which a rack arrangement can be placed to keep the vegetable up out of the water niay be used Page 468 for steaming, provided the kettle has a tightly-fitting lid. Snap Beans Cut in one inch lengths Steam 15 to 20 minutes Dry 4 to 7 hours Peas Steam 10 minutes Dry 3 to 5 hours Corn Split each row of kernels lengthwise before cutting and scrape cob with a knife to get all the milk from the cob. To 4 quarts of corn add: 1 cup cream or rich milk  cup sugar 2 tablespoons salt Mix and boil for 20 minutes stirring constantly to prevent scorching. Spread in shallow pans and dry in the oven or dryer, stirring often. Dry until the kernels will break with clean glass-like fracture. Spinach Leaves or Other Greens Strip out heavy midribs from chard or other large leaves. Steam 1 to 3 minutes Spread on trays covered with cheesecloth, dry 2 to 4 hours in the oven. Oven Drying For most families the oven is large enough to dry all necessary foods. It is convenient and inexpensive. Cover the racks with cheesecloth or other thin material. Set the temperature control at 150. Open the oven door about every hour and change the position of the trays to give uniform drying. The temperature may be increased to 250 and FOOD PRESERVATION the oven door left slightly open all the time if desired. Drying Fruit Practically all commercially dried fruit is treated with sulphur. This is to improve the appearance, keeping qualities, and food values. After sulphuring, the fruits are sun-dried. They should be covered with cheesecloth or screens to prevent flies or insects from contaminating them. Apples Apples are the most commonly dried fruit. 'They are sliced in quarter-inch slices and may or may not be sulphur treated and dried in full sun. Fruit that is sufficiently dried has an elastic springy feel. Most fruits such as cherries, peaches, apricots, and pears are canned for home use. These fruits may also be dried, however. The Utah State Agricultural College Extension Service in Logan will supply detailed methods of sulphur treatment and drying these fruits. Drying Herbs Parsley, mint or sage may be easily dried for winter use. Hang them inside with the leaves down, and when dry, remove the leaves and store them in glass jars. 4 Storing Dried Products Be sure that foods are thoroughly dry. Sun-dried fruits should be heated in the oven at 200 before storing. Store in paper bags, covered jars, or airtight tins. Preparation for the Table Soak overnight or for several hours (about one pound of vegetables per pound of water). Drain the water into a kettle, bring it to a 469 boil, add the dried product and cook until tender. Do not overcook. FREEZING This method of food preservation is comparatively new, and is becoming increasingly popular. The natural fresh flavor, appearance, and food values are satisfactorily maintained. Present research indicates that quick freezing does not destroy vitamins A, thiamin (B:), riboflavin (Bs), or ascorbic acid (C). Vitamin losses increase if the preparation for freezing is delayed. Following are some rules to insure high-quality frozen products: 1. Select high-quality fresh products ready for immediate use. 2. Clean and prepare to preserve natural color, flavor, and food values. 3. Pack or wrap in reasonably airtight containers. 4. Freeze in quick freeze room where temperature is 10 or 15 degrees below zero. 5. Store in lockers where temperature is kept at zero. 6. Keep products frozen until ready for use. 7. Cook products requiring cooking in such a way as to retain the most food values. Freezing Fruits Fruits that freeze satisfactorily include all kinds of berries, cherries, apricots, peaches, figs, plums, and prunes. 1. Select fruits ready for table use. 2. Wash carefully, discard underripe, overripe, or bruised sections. 3. Cut large fruit (apricots, peaches, prunes) in halves or slices. 4. Pack in waxed containers, fruit jars or enameled tins. (Do not use rub- ' ber rings on fruit jars.) 470 5. Use sugar, (1/2 cup to 1 quart of fruit) ot cold syrup (342 cups sugar to 1 quart water).; 6. Keep fruit as cool as possible and get to the locker at once. 7. Freeze at 10 to 15 degrees below zero. 8. Store where temperature is kept at zero with no more than 5 degrees variation. Freezing Vegetables Vegetables that freeze satisfactorily include asparagus, green beans, lima beans, broccoli, chard, corn, peas, spinach, and cauliflower. To Prepare Vegetables for Freezing 1. Select as for table use (get products to locker as quickly as possible; no more than two hours should elapse between time of harvesting and freezing). Z. Clean and wash thoroughly. Cut, shell or slice according to type of vegetable. 3. Scald vegetables in boiling water. Use a wire basket or mosquito netting bag. Be sure water is boiling. Scald small amounts, 5 to 6 pounds. Do not over-scald. Time: Asparagus2-3 minutes Beans (Lima)2-3 minutes Beans (Snap)2-3 minutes Broccoli3-5 minutes Cauliflower2-3 minutes Corn (cut)z2-5 minutes Peas1-1/2 minutes 4. After scalding, place at once under cold running water and leave until the vegetable is as cold as the water. Remove from water as soon as the vegetables are cooled. 5. Place products in waxed containers, fruit jars with rubber-rings or all sealing lids, or enameled cans that are airtight. 6. Pack vegetables dry or in a 2% brine solution. In the brine pack method, vegetables are packed dry in containers, and then 1/ cup of brine is poured over each pint, leaving 2 inch head space in pint containers, and 4 inch in quart containers. Brine Solution 4 teaspoons table-salt dissolved in 1 quart warm water 5 1/3 tablespoons table-salt dissolved in 1 gallon warm water Chill brine before pouring over. Vegetables. (The brine solution should be used as the cooking water when vegetables are used. ) 7. Keep the vegetables as cold as possible until they reach the locker. 8. Quick freeze and store in locker. HOME STORAGE Several vegetables lend themselves to storage better than to any other method of preservation. Carrots, beets, celery, onions, late cabbage, parsnips, sweet potatoes, potatoes, and turnips may be stored as they come from the garden. Cabbage Vitamin C is one of the important food nutrients in cabbage. Raw cabbage is one of the cheapest year-round vitamin C foods. It also contributes calcium, phosphorus, and iron. Cabbage may be stored and used fresh. It may also be made into sauerkraut and packed in jars. Sauerkraut Use fully matured heads. Shred and place in stone jars. Use alternate layers of cabbage and salt in proportion of one pound of salt to forty pounds of cabbage. Pack firmly in stone jar, cover with a clean cloth and a board or plate on which is placed a weight heavy enough to cause the brine to come up to the cover. Keep at about 86 F. For about 10 days to allow it to ferment. Remove skum as it forms. Pack in glass jars and add enough brine to fill jar. (Continued on page 478)
