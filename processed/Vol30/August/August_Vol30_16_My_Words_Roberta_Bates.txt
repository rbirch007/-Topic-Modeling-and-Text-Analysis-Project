DIURNAL ENSEMBLE Celia A. Van Cott
DAWN
White aspens drip quicksilver dew below Each leaf-fringed bough where lupins nod and blow; From purple sage gray-mottled grouse arise On whirring wings into metallic skies.
The white swans lift from blue lagoons and wing Through platinum mists; gay purple martins swing Up greensward slopes and foaming white cascades, Atilting wings in daring escapades.
Across the dawn, pale pistillated green Lies fused in crescent waves of rosy sheen; Through pink-flanged clouds a scintillating ray Of golden light bursts through to pattern day.
DAY
A linnet trills his morning melody Beside a nest couched in a willow tree; The mother lifts her palpitating breast Where young stretch yellow mouths in hungry quest.
High noon lies hushed and still; no soothing breeze Stirs lagging leaves on dusty roadside trees; Birds seek relief from waves of heat that come Like molten metal from the copper sun.
The cattle browse upon the shadowed hill Through blue-eyed grass; wild pungent odors spill Their fragrance on the slowly cooling air And dusk descends like wordless lips at prayer.
DUSK
The soothing peace of dusk is shattered by The nightbird's scream and loon's wild shrieking cry. Through lily pads green speckled bullfrogs slide Into black lacquer from each marshbound side;
A heron skims across the lake, and flies To grass-lined nest: below gray charcoal skies. A twangy breeze sweeps down the sage-clad hill; A ripple laps the shore, then all is still.
Below a thin white moon gray storm clouds swing And darkness holds close every living thing; One paling amber star alone gives light For all the prowling creatures of the night.
No human hand can pattern life, or birth Of light, the heaven's pageantry, or earth; Nor can it mold one atomistic part Of mortal man or his emotive heart.

The Latter-day Saint Family
Its Ideals and Responsibilities
Elder Milton Bennion General Superintendent of the Deseret Sunday School Union
THE perpetuation of the race is a major social purpose of the family. This is universally recognized by thinking people everywhere. The Latter-day Saints accept this but in a much more impressive and far-reaching way than do any other people; this because of their belief in the eternity of the family relationship and the eternal progress of man.
Sexual purity, while long and widely recognized as an ideal, and even among some primitive tribes enforced by severe penalties for its violation, receives a new and much more sacred sanction in the teachings of the Latter-day Saints. Parents are, of course, strictly bound, themselves, to practice chastity in the proper meaning of that term. With this as a foundation, they are religiously obligated to develop in their children the highest ideals of family life and sex relations. This calls for understanding not only of the nature of children and youths in general, but also for careful study of the nature of each child for whose moral and religious education the parents are primarily responsible. This responsibility cannot be shifted to any other agency. The Church and the school should, of course, supplement the educational efforts of the family, and the civic community should do its best to build favorable and eliminate unfavorable influences for the proper moral development of children and youths. It is a great mistake, however, to assume that they, individually or collectively, can relieve the family of its responsibility. One of the tragedies of the war situation is that some mothers, either for what they conceive to be patriotic reasons or for The CoverLake McDonald, Glacier National Park. Photo by Hileman. Page 461 462 financial gain, will leave their children without proper guardianship while they are employed outside the home. A mother's duty to her children is her first duty also to her country. One of the greatest dangers to our country, viewed through the generations, is the character demoralization of her future citizens. Without strength, purity, and integrity of character on the part of citizens generally, there can be no national security or achievement worth saving. ' 'In the training of children, emphasis should always be on the positive side. Wholesome pleasures and stimulation of ambition for service and high achievement may be supplemented at opportune times and circumstances by warnings against temptations to take a downward course, but even this may be done with youth in such a way as to lead them to picture in imagination the dire consequence of evil practices. When a youth pictures vividly to himself the consequence of indulging his appetites or passions contrary to the teachings of the Church, it will have far more weight with him than will mere dogmatic teaching or parental commands, although under some circumstances this method may be necessary, especially with RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINEAUGUST 1943 children. Even they, however, are generally more able to think and to understand more than most adults give them credit for. 'They should be given a chance to think and to make some decisions for themselves. Parents should, of course, see that the children are led to revise wrong decisions and never to act upon judgments that may be morally or religiously detrimental either to themselves or to others. Arbitrary commands on the part of parents sometimes have the reverse effect of that anticipated. This may be true of attendance at religious gatherings. Sometimes, attempts to force youth in these matters may lead to deception or rebellion and sometimes to hatred of the obligations that parents attempt to force upon them. Even when, out of respect for parents, they yield to the parental admonition, they sometimes cease the activity as soon as parental authority is outgrown. A teacher in Ancient Greece is credited with saying that it was his business to teach boys to love the right. 'That is a primary obligation of parents toward their children. Until they acquire a love of the right and the habit of acting upon that love as a motive, their characters will be imperfectly formed. SINCERITY Alice Morrey Bailey Never sing to me, I beg, the songs I want to hear Lest they, unwilling, forced, may come discordant to my ear. I'd rather have you, trusting that their joyous truthful ring May touch in me an echo, singthe songs you like to sing. President Rudger Clawson Elder George Albert Smith President of the Council of the Twelve HE following quotation is taken from Some Impressions of My Father by Samuel G. Clawson, son of President Rudger Clawson: "Life left no residue of bitterness in him; impression and memories left no scar. He never indulged in selfpity; never tolerated self-esteem. There was no elation when he won. He either won and turned victory into wisdom for the next encounter, else he endured and waited. He never lost because he saw time as part of endless eternity." Brother Clawson, who passed away Monday, June 21, 1943, presided over the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles for eighteen years and has been a member of the Council for forty-five years. I have been privileged to be intimately associated with him for forty years. To know him was to love him. His kindly, gentle ways have endeared him to all who knew him. His quiet, thoughtful mien gave his co-workers confidence in him, his judgment, and purposes. He was a friend to everyone. His kindliness made him the confidant of the heartbroken and weary. He visited and cheered the sick, inspired and gave hope to the discouraged. Undeviating loyalty to the Presidency of the Church was an outstanding characteristic of the life of President Rudger Clawson. He was a consistent and industrious, hard-working executive. He presided with dignity over the Council of the Twelve Apostles making the stake and mission visiting appointmnts both for this. Quorum, the PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON First Council of Seventy, and the Presiding Bishopric. He was careful and considerate in his budgeting of assignments, endeavoring to divide the burdens equally. He took his full share of the work and utilized every ounce of his energy to take care of the responsibilities placed upon him as long as his strength permitted. All his public utterances were marked with toleration. His discourses were full of substance and deserving of careful study. A proverbial patience, a flawless faith, a fidelity to the truth coupled with a devotion to the Church and all that it stands for, have made achievements possible which will remain eternally to the credit of Rudger Clawson. Page 463 A Pioneer Homemaker Julia A. Caine A NEW world was opened in 1803 to the expanding Americans who were pushing beyond the western hills. All life seemed to revolve around new ideas and dreams of homes to the west of the broad Mississippi. Word of the great purchase was carried into the isolated hamlets of New Hampshire by postrider, and here men gathered on street corners and talked of moving to the new country, Louisiana, the land beyond the Mississippi. While excitement was at its height in the town of Hillsborough, New Hampshire, a baby girl was born who was to traverse that great territory far into the west and was to establish the first home in the Great Basin. The tiny baby, Harriet Page Wheeler, cared little for her father's talk of the great Napoleon, Indians, and Lewis and Clarke, but these ideas were everyday conversation in the little home, and the West held a promise of adventure as she grew up in New England. Her own home was the typical frontier house of the small settlements where the family was taught to do all things needed for its comfort. She learned to weave her own clothes, trim her own hats, and cook for the family. At the age of sixteen, she was ready for a real adventure in the fabulous West. School teachers were scarce in those days, and a seventeen-year-old gitl who could teach reading, writing, and arithmetic might easily get a position in the familiar little schoolhouse. Harriet packed her Page 464 Caine trunk and set forth for western New York where friends had secured her the job of schoolmarm at Phelps. The young teacher had a school attended by children of all ages. She was very dignified as she listened to the primer class sing their alphabet and as she helped the older students with their fractions. Indian stories in the old readers were her special delight and she must have dreamed often of a land even farther west then frontier New York. The schoolmarm boarded around in the village, went sleigh riding, and made friends with everyone. One of the town's young men soon became her constant companion and eventually, upon becoming the wife of Isaac Decker, Phelps became her home. But America was moving west, and any move to a new frontier held out golden promise. The Deckers joined this moving throng, and finally came to settle in the Ohio country where land was cheap. At New Portage, their home was the typical frontier dwelling. Each morning the family was up at 5 o'clock and breakfast was eaten by lamp light. The boys aided their father in the barnyard, the girls helped with the household tasks, and soon learned to weave, bake bread, and sew. The browneyed Harriet was building her frontier home as her people before her had builded in New England. "TRAVELERS were few in this land of little hamlets, and the family welcomed a preacher who A PIONEER HOMEMAKER talked of wonderful things that had happened in New York State. How the tired housewife must have enjoyed hearing 'of rivers and hills so near to her old home in Phelps. The wandering preacher was asked to return and the family began to read the books he discussed. They had attended many revival meetings in the past, but this man talked of a new religion that followed the old teaching of the Biblea religion of joy and promise. Here happiness was the keynote. He spoke of a gathering of his people to the West. Soon the Decker family gathered their belongings, joined the Latterday Saint Church, and moved west to Franklin, Ohio, near Kirtland, the home of many Latter-day Saint people. They joined wholeheartedly with their new companions, and, when the Church was in need of funds, the father of this little family gave his entire savings to help his people. Like all Latter-day Saint families, this family was looked upon with distrust by non-Mormon neighbors, who soon began to avoid them. What courage it must have taken to join with other Latter-day Saints and leave for the far Missouri! The turbulent Westerners in Missouri hated the quiet industry of this people who built towns so quickly on the best river lands. Many of the early settlers had come to the frontier either to procure large slave holdings or because they did not fit into the orderly society of the East. Mormon homes grew too rapidly into settlements. Frontier Missouri finally succeeded in driving the Mormons out. So back across Missouri moved the 465 tired little band, and in 1841 they settled on land at a bend of the Mississippi River, later to be known as Nauvoo the Beautiful. Here the well-built houses and shaded streets brought memories of New England. The Decker family now hoped that they had found a permanent home. Yet, even now, the little dwelling was not secure. Isaac Decker had tired of the continual moving and no longer felt enthusiastic for the society that shut him apart from other companions, and so he and his wife, whose whole soul was dominated by religious fervor, parted. Later, she married Lorenzo D. Young and made a pleasant home on the bank of the Mississippi. When the terrible months of persecution came and the Prophet-leader was killed, mobs threatened the beautiful Nauvoo, and Harriet was one of the first to make preparations to move to the West. HE broad Mississippi was frozen as the wagons waited in front of the little home on that cold February day in 1846. The children climbed inside; Lorenzo Young helped his wife into the wagon, and they turned toward the river. Across the ice and on to the Missouri moved the people, trusting in their leaders, who were men of God, to lead them to a new home. When the early spring of 1847 came, Winter Quarters, the temporary resting place of the Saints, was a bustle of activity. Songs of the West rang out and there was talk of California. There was. Also talk of missions to the Indians and how even now the elders of the Church were preaching to the Lamanites. 466 Definite plans were made for a small company to go farther west and to find a home for the people. Harriet's husband was chosen a member of this party. Harriet, suffering from maleria, begged to be taken with them. Brigham Young yielded to Lorenzo and Harriet's desire and agreed to let her go. Two other women also went with this band of scouts over the mountains to find a refuge and a home. 'They were Clara Decker Young, wife of Brigham Young and daughter of Harriet, and Ellen S. Kimball, wife of Heber C. Kimball. Two children accompanied Harriet. On April 7, the heavily loaded wagons started the long trek west. Seeds, plows, chickens, pigs, and cows made the caravan a picturesque sight. Each night the wagons formed a circle with interlocking wheels into which the cattle were driven. Each evening the women cooked over the campfire. Songs were sung around the fires which awakened echoes on the Platte River that had previously known only the whoop of Indian braves or the more riotous songs of the fortune seeker. Each morning this band of pioneers was up at five o'clock and by seven the train was moving on toward the Rockies. Rafts were built to ford the streams as the band pushed west. In late July the pioneers crossed the South Pass where eleven years earlier Narcissa Whitman had kneeled in thanksgiving for the right to carry the white man's Book to the Indians; but the path of these pioneers lay to the south. The Oregon had become the destination for too many traders and homeseekers. Soon the wagons crossed the rugRELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINEAUGUST 1943 ged Uintahs and wound down nartow Echo Canyon, where boulders and brush made it hard going for the wagons. The men had to cut a trail; rocks had to be moved. When the turn was made into East Canyon, the way seemed almost impassable. 'The canyon itself was steep; wolves lurked in the underbrush, and rattlesnakes lay in wait for the unwary. The crooked stream was willow-fringed, and rocks made the frequent crossings very slow and precarious. Everywhere huge peaks towered, and the July sun beat upon the toiling men as they tried to clear a way. At last Big Mountain was reached, and from its summit they glimpsed a broad valley which lay over yet another mountain. This must be the place Bridger had told of! This was the valley Goodyear had described. They hoped it was better than the traders had pictured. Now the little band rallied its strength, and by midday, Brigham Young and his brother Lorenzo and their wives were on the benchland east of the Great Salt Lake Valley. The broad stretches of treeless country shimmered in the heat. The women looked over their new home; a lizard ran across the foot of Harriet. She was tired. No house, grass or trees rested her weary eyes. She heard Brigham Young say, "This is the place," and she burst into tears. THE journey had been hard and now this! The sage brush, the sunflowers, nothing looked like home to her as she cried, "Lorenzo, we have traveled fifteen hundred miles over prairies, deserts, and mountains, but feeble as I am, I would rather journey A PIONEER HOMEMAKER a thousand miles farther than stay in this desolate place." But this was to be home. Lorenzo immediately plowed a small tract of land, onto which the water from City Creek was diverted, and he planted the first potatoes in the valley. The day following the entrance into the valley, a strange little assembly gathered, and a little band of worshippers thanked God for their new home. 'They were advised to make a fort for protection, and the next day the work of planting and home building began. At first Harriet's house was in the log and adobe fort, but this was so different from her usual home that she was very unhappy. Her new baby, who had been born in September, fretted in the mud-roofed cabin, and all the houses were so close together that Harriet lacked the privacy she craved. She was a home builder, and stockade life was disagreeable to her. In December, therefore, Lorenzo completed a log cabin of his own outside the fort some distance away. The other members protested at this move because of the danger of Indians, but Harriet thought only of homemaking. Even after an unfriendly Indian did invade her cabin 467 one day, she still refused to leave. It was in January, as she rocked her baby, that the rude savage invaded the little house and demanded "biscuit." Through a ruse, she loosed her watchdog, a powerful mastiff tied in the next room, and took the bow and arrows away from the Indian who had been wounded by the dog. Then, binding up the shoulder of the sullen native, she sent him on his way, and continued her life outside the fort. Spring had hardly arrived before the beauty-loving Harriet was hard at work making her house a home. She had brought the first children into the little settlement. Her son was the first white boy to be born in the Valley. Now she began to plan her home. Lorenzo brought a small locust tree from the mountains, and Harriet planted it in the front of her house. This was the first tree planted in the Valley. Her yard was the present yard of the Bee Hive House. This intrepid woman had dreamed of the great West, but always as a place of homes. She realized that dream as she planted trees and gardens. Men may plan cities, but women build homes. Salt Lake City is a city of homes and trees, and Harriet Wheeler Young was its original homemaker. MY WANTS. Roberta Bates I only want a little house, A lilac tree beside the door. A house with windows clean and bright, And sunlight dancing on the floor To the lilting music of childish laughter; A hearth whereon a kettle sings; Some birds to nest in the lilac tree, And a patch of sky to try their wings. Food Preservation Edna K. Ward HERE are several methods 'of "preserving" the home food supply of fresh fruits and vegetables during the summer growing season. 'To know that no fruits nor vegetables have been wasted, and to have an adequate winter supply of these important foods will be a great satisfaction to all homemakers. Latter-day Saint housewives have always been interested in preserving the summer supply of fruits and vegetables for winter use, and have practiced the adage of "waste not, want not." Vegetables and fruits may be preserved by canning, drying, freezing, and storing. It is the purpose of the following discussion to explain briefly the last three methods. DRYING Drying or dehydration of fruits and vegetables means that enough water is removed to stop the growth of molds and other organisms. If done properly, it will also preserve much of the flavor, color, and food value. Dried products occupy less space for storing. Drying Vegetables 1. Select vegetables that have reached the table-use stage. 2. Clean thoroughly, remove all blemishes. 3. Precook or steam. This prevents excessive loss of food value, sets the color, and hastens drying. Steaming is preferable to boiling in water. Any large kettle in which a rack arrangement can be placed to keep the vegetable up out of the water niay be used Page 468 for steaming, provided the kettle has a tightly-fitting lid. Snap Beans Cut in one inch lengths Steam 15 to 20 minutes Dry 4 to 7 hours Peas Steam 10 minutes Dry 3 to 5 hours Corn Split each row of kernels lengthwise before cutting and scrape cob with a knife to get all the milk from the cob. To 4 quarts of corn add: 1 cup cream or rich milk  cup sugar 2 tablespoons salt Mix and boil for 20 minutes stirring constantly to prevent scorching. Spread in shallow pans and dry in the oven or dryer, stirring often. Dry until the kernels will break with clean glass-like fracture. Spinach Leaves or Other Greens Strip out heavy midribs from chard or other large leaves. Steam 1 to 3 minutes Spread on trays covered with cheesecloth, dry 2 to 4 hours in the oven. Oven Drying For most families the oven is large enough to dry all necessary foods. It is convenient and inexpensive. Cover the racks with cheesecloth or other thin material. Set the temperature control at 150. Open the oven door about every hour and change the position of the trays to give uniform drying. The temperature may be increased to 250 and FOOD PRESERVATION the oven door left slightly open all the time if desired. Drying Fruit Practically all commercially dried fruit is treated with sulphur. This is to improve the appearance, keeping qualities, and food values. After sulphuring, the fruits are sun-dried. They should be covered with cheesecloth or screens to prevent flies or insects from contaminating them. Apples Apples are the most commonly dried fruit. 'They are sliced in quarter-inch slices and may or may not be sulphur treated and dried in full sun. Fruit that is sufficiently dried has an elastic springy feel. Most fruits such as cherries, peaches, apricots, and pears are canned for home use. These fruits may also be dried, however. The Utah State Agricultural College Extension Service in Logan will supply detailed methods of sulphur treatment and drying these fruits. Drying Herbs Parsley, mint or sage may be easily dried for winter use. Hang them inside with the leaves down, and when dry, remove the leaves and store them in glass jars. 4 Storing Dried Products Be sure that foods are thoroughly dry. Sun-dried fruits should be heated in the oven at 200 before storing. Store in paper bags, covered jars, or airtight tins. Preparation for the Table Soak overnight or for several hours (about one pound of vegetables per pound of water). Drain the water into a kettle, bring it to a 469 boil, add the dried product and cook until tender. Do not overcook. FREEZING This method of food preservation is comparatively new, and is becoming increasingly popular. The natural fresh flavor, appearance, and food values are satisfactorily maintained. Present research indicates that quick freezing does not destroy vitamins A, thiamin (B:), riboflavin (Bs), or ascorbic acid (C). Vitamin losses increase if the preparation for freezing is delayed. Following are some rules to insure high-quality frozen products: 1. Select high-quality fresh products ready for immediate use. 2. Clean and prepare to preserve natural color, flavor, and food values. 3. Pack or wrap in reasonably airtight containers. 4. Freeze in quick freeze room where temperature is 10 or 15 degrees below zero. 5. Store in lockers where temperature is kept at zero. 6. Keep products frozen until ready for use. 7. Cook products requiring cooking in such a way as to retain the most food values. Freezing Fruits Fruits that freeze satisfactorily include all kinds of berries, cherries, apricots, peaches, figs, plums, and prunes. 1. Select fruits ready for table use. 2. Wash carefully, discard underripe, overripe, or bruised sections. 3. Cut large fruit (apricots, peaches, prunes) in halves or slices. 4. Pack in waxed containers, fruit jars or enameled tins. (Do not use rub- ' ber rings on fruit jars.) 470 5. Use sugar, (1/2 cup to 1 quart of fruit) ot cold syrup (342 cups sugar to 1 quart water).; 6. Keep fruit as cool as possible and get to the locker at once. 7. Freeze at 10 to 15 degrees below zero. 8. Store where temperature is kept at zero with no more than 5 degrees variation. Freezing Vegetables Vegetables that freeze satisfactorily include asparagus, green beans, lima beans, broccoli, chard, corn, peas, spinach, and cauliflower. To Prepare Vegetables for Freezing 1. Select as for table use (get products to locker as quickly as possible; no more than two hours should elapse between time of harvesting and freezing). Z. Clean and wash thoroughly. Cut, shell or slice according to type of vegetable. 3. Scald vegetables in boiling water. Use a wire basket or mosquito netting bag. Be sure water is boiling. Scald small amounts, 5 to 6 pounds. Do not over-scald. Time: Asparagus2-3 minutes Beans (Lima)2-3 minutes Beans (Snap)2-3 minutes Broccoli3-5 minutes Cauliflower2-3 minutes Corn (cut)z2-5 minutes Peas1-1/2 minutes 4. After scalding, place at once under cold running water and leave until the vegetable is as cold as the water. Remove from water as soon as the vegetables are cooled. 5. Place products in waxed containers, fruit jars with rubber-rings or all sealing lids, or enameled cans that are airtight. 6. Pack vegetables dry or in a 2% brine solution. In the brine pack method, vegetables are packed dry in containers, and then 1/ cup of brine is poured over each pint, leaving 2 inch RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINEAUGUST 1943 head space in pint containers, and 4 inch in quart containers. Brine Solution 4 teaspoons table-salt dissolved in 1 quart warm water 5 1/3 tablespoons table-salt dissolved in 1 gallon warm water Chill brine before pouring over. Vegetables. (The brine solution should be used as the cooking water when vegetables are used. ) 7. Keep the vegetables as cold as possible until they reach the locker. 8. Quick freeze and store in locker. HOME STORAGE Several vegetables lend themselves to storage better than to any other method of preservation. Carrots, beets, celery, onions, late cabbage, parsnips, sweet potatoes, potatoes, and turnips may be stored as they come from the garden. Cabbage Vitamin C is one of the important food nutrients in cabbage. Raw cabbage is one of the cheapest year-round vitamin C foods. It also contributes calcium, phosphorus, and iron. Cabbage may be stored and used fresh. It may also be made into sauerkraut and packed in jars. Sauerkraut Use fully matured heads. Shred and place in stone jars. Use alternate layers of cabbage and salt in proportion of one pound of salt to forty pounds of cabbage. Pack firmly in stone jar, cover with a clean cloth and a board or plate on which is placed a weight heavy enough to cause the brine to come up to the cover. Keep at about 86 F. For about 10 days to allow it to ferment. Remove skum as it forms. Pack in glass jars and add enough brine to fill jar. (Continued on page 478) Woman's Sphere Ramona W. Cannon ERNARD SHAW has stated that woman's emancipation, with the growth of feminism, has not tended to discourage masculinity in men, but has tended to discourage boorishness, a trait of the weak who are trying to conceal their weakness. "THERE have always been men who believe that women like to be dominated by the "stronger sex." Ralph A. Habas, in the April issue of Facts, discusses this question thoughtfully in an article, "Do Women Want Domination?". He takes the negative viewpoint, and says that an attitude of voluntary cooperation should be the keynote of a happy marriage; neither dominance nor submissiveness, but a deep-seated regard for each other's personality. "THE magnitude of America's Red Cross movement may be gauged by activities in its Brooklyn, New York, headquarters, reported by Louis Markey in "Twenty-four Hours a Day," (Red Book, April 1943.) Most of the 43,000 workers are women, generally unpaid volunteers. In the Home Service Division, contacts are established, when necessary, between American families and their sons overseas (about 8,000 cases monthly). In the Blood Donors' Division, twenty cots are occupied nearly all the time. Stationary canteens are operated by 2,000 women. 'There are 1,000 nurses' aids, 200 Gray Ladies, 300 staff assistants, 500 stenographers and clerks, and 100 F. B. I. Assistants. In the Public Education Division, 250,000 women have taken courses in first aid, home nursing, nutrition, and diet. The workers deliver 5,500,000 surgical dressings monthly. 'OURAGE in Women: The mother of the five Sullivan brothers killed on a torpedoed boat says she would "'do it again" for America, and carries on the heavy work of the farm with her husband. Her last surviving child, Genevieve Marie, joined the WAVES. MERICAN factory girls, packing chemical supplies for an urgently needed overseas shipment, were severely burned by the fumes, but continued at their posts until the task was completed.

Mrs. Jensen has been active for many years in Relief Society work, and her husband was a ward bishop for seven years, Page 478  EDITORIAL 9 VOL. 30 AUGUST 1943 President Rudger Clawson TRUE and trusted friend of the General Board of the Relief Society was the late President Rudger Clawson. He was appointed by the First Presidency of the Church, in September 1919, "to audit the books of the General Board, examine the methods of accounting employed and to make recommendations regarding the bookkeeping and accounting as conditions might require." He thus became special advisor and supervisor of the business and financial affairs of the Board, which duty he faithfully and efficiently performed. This able and experienced accountant consolidated the accounts of the Board; set up a modern system of bookkeeping, and then for years supervised the operation of that system; with painstaking care he reviewed the accounts and regularly examined the receipts and disbursements; guarded the expenditures; and annually audited the books and at all times gave sound financial advice. He thus set up for Relief Society a safe and wise pattern of procedure which has been easy to follow. As a professional bookkeeper and auditor of long experience, President Clawson's contribution to the General Board has a value so great that it can hardly be measured. With painstaking care President Clawson also examined and became familiar with the Relief Society stake and ward record books, and with the Page 472 annual financial, statistical, and narrative reports sent in annually by these organizations to be audited and compiled by the General Secretary for presentation to the General Board and to the women of the whole organization. Few Relief Society women were more familiar with the inner workings of the organization, and no one was more proud of the systematic and painstaking efforts and accomplishments of stake and ward officers and workers in carrying on these practical affairs of the organization than was President Rug Clawson. Hardly a week in the year passed without a visit to Relief Society headquarters by this good and faithful man. Keenly did he sense his responsibility, and greatly interested was he in the affairs of the organization. 'This close association over a period of more than twenty years, together with his kindness, friendliness, courtesy, and good humor endeared him not only to the executive officers, but to every member of the staff. President Clawson was consulted regarding many of the varied problems of the Society as a whole, and his wise and fatherly counsel and advice were always very helpful. President Clawson was a living example of loyalty and devotion to the Church. No sacrifice was too great for him to make for the Gospel of the Master. He was a great defender of the faith. While he had EDITORIAL always a mild-appearing manner, yet for the right he was always aggressive. He always manifested that same courage which he exhibited when, as a young missionary in Georgia, he bravely faced the firing squad of that threatening and infuriated mob which had brutally taken the life of his missionary companion; and as he stood beside the dead 473 body of his associate and listened to the continued threats of the mob, he even bared his breast and told them to shoot. This surprising attitude on his part so startled the mob that they turned away, leaving him alone with the body of his friend and companion in the dense woods of GeorgiaAmy Brown Lyman. Train Up a Child In the Way He Should Go  the worth of souls is great in the sight of God." Thus did the Lord speak to the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1829. In view of this general declaration, how great a responsibility rests upon parents who take upon themselves the sacred obligation of bringing certain spirits into this world through their lineage, clothing them with temporal bodies, and passing on to those spirits much of their physical and mental characteristics. What a strict accounting will be required of parents as to the manner in which they guarded and protected, trained up and set in the path of righteousness those immortal souls specifically entrusted to their care! There is no duty more obligatory upon this earth than the duty resting upon parents to rear their children properly. When parents are called upon to account for the manner in which they have trained their children, what excuse will be accepted for laxness or neglect in the training? Will any mother be able to point to any other service she may have performed as being more vital and important than the proper rearing of her children? In accepting any type of employment, the prime concern of a mother should be the question as to whether or not her children will be properly and adequately cared for during her absence. ) What are some of the activities of a Latter-day Saint family which serve as loops of steel to bind the family together and strengthen it to live, as a unit, a righteous life? One of the strongest bonds. Certainly, is family prayer, the uniting of a family. In a spiritual oneness. Seldom is a family drawn more closely together than at such times. Any righteous activity or observance of a law of the Lord entered into by an entire family will guide that family along the straight path. Among such activities may be mentioned the proper observance of the Sabbath, the keeping of the Word of Wisdom, refraining from any criticism of Church au- (Continued on page 522) Tomorrow's Cup Anna Prince Redd CHAPTER V Synopsis: Janet, projectingly reared in Washington, D. C., lives in constant dread of the San Juan country of Utah where her husband, Paul Morgan, has an Indian trading post on the mesa. She plans on their moving to Washington before the birth of her baby, but does not disclose this intention to her husband. Upon returning home with Paul after a happy week spent on the mesa, they find that Janet's sister, Rhae, and her husband, Warren Newsbaum, have arrived for a short visit with the announced intention of taking Janet back to Washington with them. The next morning Paul is hurt when he saves Warren from being dragged by a broncho. A few months later, while Paul, restored to health, is absent on a roundup, an Indian, Mike, threatens to kill Janet. She seeks refuge in the Devil's Corridor where she becomes unconscious. HE minute Dr. Potsworth's old Ford rattled into the yard at El Toro he was out of it, his short legs pushing through the sand and up the flagstone path to the house. He panted to a stop as Paul threw open the door, flung his hat aside and grumbled nervously: "Can't a respectable doctor turn his back on a patient but there's mischief to pay? Janet was laughing and well only a few hours ago!" "You saw her? You were here?" "Of course. I come as often as the weather and roads will let me. Why, the place looks like the leavings of a tornado! What's been going on here?" "IT wish I knew," Paul gritted. "Hurry, doctor, please!" "What a mess." Dr. Potsworth examined the room professionally. Page 474 "Quite an operation. An amputation or two; a few broken joints" "Never mind the room," Paul begged. "Janet's in here, Doc. Hurty!" He threw open the bedroom door. "I found her unconscious in the Devil's Corridor." "Hurt?" "T can't tell. Something pretty bad must have happened. I came home to find Taos knifed in the throat, Juanee gone, and the place smashed to bits." One look at Janet, lying inert, beads of perspiration along her hairline, and Dr. Potsworth became absorbed. At the sound of their voices, Janet stirred restlessly. Paul took her hand and began to chafe her fingers gently. "Will you be able to handle this, Doc? You'll know a specialistIt was all my fault. I" "Take it easy, Paul. Of course I can handle it. We'll get help when we need it." "Then do something. Don't just stand there looking at -her!"' "There isn't anything to do. Not now. 'Tomorrow, maybe." "I can't stand it till tomorrow. It's all my fault, I tell you; I left her alone. I don't even know what happened!" - "Whatever is was, it happened after I left here. Evidently it had something to do with Janet's collapse. But I'm inclined to think this might have happened anyway. Janet's lived with fear too long." TOMORROW'S CUP "Fear. Janet afraid? Doc, you're all wrong. Janet isn't afraid of anything! Why, she stands up to this country like a veteran! 'This was no ordinary fear." "No. It's evident that Janet had cause to hide in the Corridor. But that's not what I mean. You've sold yourself on the idea that this country belonged to the gods before they turned it over to you. Well,, it didn't. It's cold and hard and exacting; only you're too absorbed to see it. Janet's been afraid since the day she came to El Toro to live!" Paul groaned. '""Then let's get her out of here!" "Her only chance lies in rest and quiet. She must not be moved." "But what is it? What causes such things? If it wasn't fear, then what was it?" | "We don't know. Such cases are not uncommon, however." Dr. Potsworth turned from his long contemplation of Janet and went to the window. "Why don't you do something?" Paul implored. "Take her pulse; do anything except just stand there!" "Her pulse is all right. I counted the one in her throat. She's tired; she wants to rest." "And I thought mustangs couldn't break her spirit." "She may sleep this off." "But Janet isn't asleep. Even I can tell that!" "No. She isn't asleep, now, but she soon will be. She may sleep for days." Potsworth turned from the window. "Don't worry too much, Paul. I have the feeling that What might happen in this case, won't happen. I'll send for Mark Groneman if it'll make you feel bet- 475 ter. He's the latest authority on this sort of thing." Paul noted the break in Potsworth's sentence, and his heart sank. He wanted to ask, "Authority on what?" but shrank from the clarity of professional terms. If he could believe that Janet was all right, that she was going to be all right, then he could keep sane, and wait. But did Potsworth know? After all, he was getting on in years "T'll send the telegram to Groneman," Paul said. "There's no one else to go, and the phone is wrecked." Potsworth scribbled the message. Paul looked long at Janet,. Then he turned and went hurriedly out. ~ FE, was back before Potsworth expected him, even in his state of mind. "Possibly a dead horse on the ranch tonight, as well as a dead dog," he reproved. "'There's no use going off the deep end, Paul. I've told you that, for the present at least, Janet is all right." Paul nodded miserably. "'I'd like a clueThere's something unhealthy in store for someone. I wish Joe would come. And what do you suppose happened to that measly squaw?"' "Juanee is probably on her way here now. I fancy her leaving, and the fracas here, originated from the same source. Juanee's faithful as only a squaw can be. I'll warrant she's in trouble, too." Janet sighed deeply, but not a muscle of her body moved. "We're talking too much. Suppose you go out and straighten up a bit; pick up the pieces. I'll hold clinic in here." 476 "You'll stay all night?" "Yes. But don't you go stirring up trouble. Janet needs you here." Potsworth followed Paul out. "T'll be here, Doc, but that's no insurance for the Indian that started this." Potsworth looked at him shrewdly. "You've got a posse out?" "Within an hour every man in Grayson will be out after the Indians." | "Tt's an Indian, all right. Mike. And possibly that brat of his." "Mike! How do you know?" "Mike's blind in one eye, and can't shoot straight. See that bullet hole above your head?" Paul glanced at the casing of the door against which he leaned. Potsworth indicated a gouge in the wood. "Tt glanced off. I'll bet every bullet that was fired took the same angle." Paul picked up the empty shell. "That came out of my own gun!" "There'll be a straight bullet for Mike, and it won't glance off!" "Now, look here, Paul. 'The whole Indian nation isn't responsible for this. I'll hold you accountable if there's a feud stirred up. Those hotheads will grab the first Indian they meet. You've got to stop them. Now get out and fix that telephone wire so we can call off the dogs!" "Why didn't I have you do that instead of sending you to town, anyway?" he grumbled as Paul went. "For a bright man, I haven't much sense!" THERE'S the plane!" Paul raced from the patio toward the desert pasture. "That's Groneman, all right!" "That's a soft landing field." RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINEAUGUST 1943 "He'll make it! Things too regular!" "That's a perfect landing if I ever saw one!" Paul cried. "Look at the cowboys scatter; they expected the plane to bounce all over the country and end up in a bed of prickly pears." Paul was already halfway to the pasture; Dr. Potsworth hurried after him as fast as his shorter legs would take him, puffing and wheezing like his old car in a sand rut. Fifteen minutes later the two doctors were in Janet's room, holding a consultation. "Why did you send for me, Potsworth? You had this catalogued." Dr. Groneman had been watching Janet intently for several minutes. Exactly the same expression was on his face that Potsworth's had worn when he first saw her. "Tm gettin' old and seedy, Mark. Been out here so long I can't tell mumps from whooping cough." "You're as good an authority as we have on this sort of thing, Potsworth, I may as well go back, for any good I'll be. But I'd like to stick around and watch you work. How could anybody get nerve exhaustion in a place like this? It's the top of the world!" "Let's turn the patient over to your nurse and take a little of it in," Potsworth said. "I've been glued to this spot for-two days. I'm mighty thankful to have a nurse on the scene. Even our Indian woman was - gone when I got here." There followed days of waiting. Paul worked tirelessly at insignifcant things, saying little. Janet roused occasionally to a state that bordered consciousness, but most of the time she slept a detached, He doesn't like TOMORROW'S CUP feather-like sleep. 'The household lived on tiptoe. On the fifth morning, Paul followed Dr. Potsworth into the yard. Dawn was breaking, rose-hued over the desert. Wind brushed against his face with sympathetic coolness. Paul neither saw nor heard. "I can't stand this any longer, Doc," he said. "I thought I'd feel better if I didn't know the worst, but I don't. Nothing could be worse than the things I conjure up. What is it both you and Groneman imply, yet do not say, even between yourselves? What is it you fear?" "Paralysis." The word cut the air like hawk wings. Paul felt the pressure of blood in every vein of his body. Potsworth took his arm and they went back to the house. At the door Paul said doggedly: "If we could get her to a hospital" "We've discussed that endlessly, Groneman and J. We both agree that her chance is still in perfect quiet. If labor will hold off a few more days, the odds will be on her side. The shock of childbirth now 'might be too much." "And the. Baby?" Paul asked it, dreading the answer. "Several days overdue. That's the chance we have to take. Nature's pretty sensible, we can but help her out." " Paul pressed the doctor's hand and went slowly toward the store. "It's awfulthis waitingthis uselessness," he muttered. '"My fingers itch to clutch the hair of a redskin, any one of them, just so I'll feel like a man again!" But he'd given Doc his word not to go gunning for Mike, and he'd keep it. To the disgust of 477 the cowboys, he'd called off the posse. Only Indian Joe was left to dog Mike's trail. And Joe would do it. If only Juanee would talk! But until Joe came back she would not do that. She had been to her father's hogan and found them gone, hide and baggage, that's all Juanee would say. She cried silently by day and chanted from her hogan by night. Paul awoke to a gray day. By noon a storm broke over the desert. 'Trees turned somersaults. Rocks shivered and broke loose from the cliffs as thunder rocked the clouds into a downpour of rain. Burnteyed, Paul watched it come; watched Janet, too. Groneman stood looking out of the window. "Will this be a shock?" he asked Dr. Potsworth, indicating Janet. "On the contrary. 'This is something she can understand. She's heard the roar of surf against rocks; rain dripping from the roof; rivers on the rampage. This will be home to Janet." "There's never been a rain like this since Janet came here," Paul said. "II hope you're right." At the height of the storm Janet's baby came, living barely an hour, then Janet fell into a restful, natural sleep. "She'll be all right now, Paul," Groneman said. "She'll remember little of this." Grief overshadowed Paul's eyes. "Thenthen Janet will never sense her lossnor know the glory of motherhood?" Potsworth sighed. "She may or may not have another child." 478 Paul dug the tiny grave on a knoll overlooking El Toro, where it would catch the first and last rays of every sun. Alone, he carried the tiny casket to the little cemetery he had made. Janet knew that in the dim hours of the dawn she had held her baby RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINEAUGUST 1943 in her arms; then they had taken it away.... When she was able to go out into the living room again it was May. The spring was full of golden days, the desert sweet with them. (To be continued) << Food Preservation (Continued from page 470) Many homes have good storage facilities. A cool, ventilated cellar under the house offers good conditions for storage of vegetables. Cellars with heating furnaces are usually too warm and dry, but often a room may be partitioned off where the temperature may be controlled by outside windows. Natural earth makes a better floor than concrete or brick because a certain amount of moisture is necessary. Outdoor storage cellars or caves are excellent for storing vegetables. Many farms have this type of cellar. It is built partly underground and offers protection from freezing, and keeps vegetables and apples in excellent condition. Write to the U. S. Department of Agriculture, Farmer's Bulletin No. 879, for the construction details of many types of cellars. We found a very simple method of storage quite satisfactory last year for keeping our Victory Garden products. Carrots, beets, turnips, and onions were put in boxes and bushel baskets, a lid placed over these containers, and holes dug in the garden soil to a little below the depth of each container, then leaves and a very small amount of soil were heaped over the containers. When we needed the products the leaves were removed, but replaced again after getting the desired amount. 'These vegetables kept very well until they were all used, sometime in January. This was a very simple method for the small amount of excess vegetables we had grown during the summer. Bibliography Stark, A.

"Sit straight," she said sharply and, giving the pitch, began the morning song. Some minutes after the tardy bell had rung, Robin Marshall hurried in and slipped into his seat. "Late again," Lois announced. "This will never do, Robin. You bring down our record." Robin hung his head. "He's always clean, at least," Lois thought as she noticed his nicely ironed blue coveralls with the folded handkerchief peeping from the breast pocket, and his blond curls brushed smooth. She couldn't say as much for most of her pupils. There was no excuse for letting children come to school dirty with their shoes untied and their hair not combed. She could hardly bear to look at some of them and nothing could have induced her to touch them. "Readerspage 6," she commanded. Then began the monotonous repetition, "I see the dog. The dog can run. I see the cat. The cat can jump." "Next, Robin." When he did not begin, Lois looked at him in surprise. He never lost the place and he was a good reader. "Robin," she repeated. "The cat," he began, "c can " She looked more closely. Big tears were falling on his book. "Carl," she said out loud, but she? Thought, "The big baby. Oh, why did I ever accept this job? I don't know anything about children of this age. Why didn't they put me in high school where I belong?" Lois got through the day somehow. Everything seemed to go wrong. Again and again Robin failed to recite. "The child must be sick," she thought. Usually he was all enthusiasm and smiles. When she came back from escorting the children to the door that afternoon, Lois sat down wearily, her head in her hands. This school had the reputation of being the least desirable school in town and it seemed to Lois that it was living up to its reputation. Miss Thomas, the second grade teacher, a woman past thirty-five, came in to borrow some colored chalk. "How do you stand it?" Lois stormed. "You've been here ten years." "Oh, it's a job," Miss Thomas answered listlessly. "Not much is expected here." She helped herself from the box on the desk. "Well, I don't intend to waste my life on such children," Lois went on, "Tl make such a record that the supervisor will notice and transfer me." She took up some pictures she had brought that morning and began to tack them to the wall. One was of a rosy-cheeked boy sliding downhill on his sled. His happy smile made her think of Robin again. What was the matter with the child, anyway? He was the one Page 479 480 bright spot in her day, usually, but lately he had failed her. If she was going to make a record, she had better begin with him. Lois put on her new squirrel coat and pulled her scarlet tam over her dark curls. Going back to the desk, she turned through her roll book and found Robin's address318 Sherman Streetnot too far to walk. She would go and have a talk with his mother.: Lois walked rapidly, for the wind was cold. As she approached the railroad tracks, she noticed that the snow got dirtier and dirtier and scraps of paper blew about. A shrill whistle sounded, and gates appeared from nowhere across her path. A long freight train moved by. Could a train have delayed Robin, she wondered? She must remember to caution the children. She had better not urge them to hurry. By the time the street was clear again, Lois was cold. She walked rapidly and soon found the number she sought. The porch was covered with muddy dog tracks. An old woman opened the door a few inches. "Im looking for Mrs. Marshall," Lois explained. "She lives at the back," the woman snapped, and closed the door. Lois went round the house. The snow had been cleared away but there was no pavement. Seeing a door at the side, she knocked. The door was opened by a young woman scarcely older than Lois. She smiled and Lois said confidently, "You are Robin's mother." "And you are his teacher." The woman stepped back courteously. "He has told me about your lovely coat. Come inwon't you?" RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINEAUGUST 1943 Lois stepped in and was immediately sorry she had not taken off her galoshes for the bare floor was spotless. Mrs. Marshall drew a plain wooden rocker towards the range. "Sit here," she said, "you must be cold." Lois noticed that the room, though small, served as kitchen, dining room and living room. 'There was very little furniture. Some clothes hung on a line over the stove. '"Won't you take off your coat?" Mrs. Marshall asked as she put a shovel of coal on the fire. "No," Lois answered. "I can't stay. I just came to ask why Robin has been tardy so often lately." Just then a wail came from the clothesbasket on the table. Mrs. Marshall took out a tiny baby and held it to her shoulder. Then she began. "Wellyou see. I'm very sorry. It's my fault, I supposenot manag-. Ing." She stopped and fussed with the baby's blanket. "It must be hard to get small children up in the morning," Lois offered. "Oh, that isn't it." Again a pause followed. "It's just that it's so hard to dry his coveralls." I don't understand," Lois said. "Well, you see, I can't wash them till he goes to bed. It was all right when I could hang them out but now they don't get dry." The baby cried again so the young mother walked back and forth. Lois waited because she did not know what to say. Hesitatingly Mrs. Marshall continued, "We've been short of coal (Continued on page 521) Can Your Stake Increase Magazine Subscriptions? General Secretary-Treasurer Vera White Pohlman N 1921, when The Relief Society Magazine was in its eighth year, the General Board was faced with the necessity of increasing the subscription price because of higher costs of printing during and after World War I. Relief Society women throughout the Church, eager to maintain the subscription price at one dollar per year, pledged themselves to increase the circulation so that the price need not be raised. They fulfilled this pledge and the price has been maintained at one dollar per year ever since. Furthermore, a steadily increasing circulation has made it possible to offer a bigger and better Magazine during the past few years, still at the dollar rate. Now, in its thirtieth year, the Magazine is again threatened with a higher subscription priceagain because of increased costs due to war conditions. And again the circulation must be greatly increased in order to avoid raising the subscription price. The General Board believes that Relief Society members, officers, and Magazine representatives will give every possible support to the Magazine in order that its present high quality may be maintained without increasing the subscription price, just as did the Relief Society women of nearly a quarter century ago. In order that the various stakes and missions may fully realize their present Magazine subscription rates and the great opportunity for extending the circulation, Magazine subscriptions in relation to Relief Society members are listed in the accompanying table and pictographs for all stakes and English-speaking missions of the Church which submitted the official annual Relief Society report to the General Board. The chart lists all stakes in alphabetical order, followed by the Englishspeaking missions. Opposite the name of each stake and mission is a row of 20 symbolssome dark and some lighteach representing 5 per cent of the Relief Society members in the stake or mission. The dark symbols represent the proportion of members who subscribed for the Magazine in 1942; the light symbols represent the proportion of members who did not subscribe for the Magazine IN 1942. The General Board has never required a specified quota of Magazine subscriptions from the various stakes, wards, and missions, but it has recognized, in the honor roll and by award subscriptions, those Societies whose subscriptions equalled or exceeded 75 per cent of their members. Accordingly, the charts show an achievement line at the 75 per cent point. From this line, stakes and missions may observe the extent to which their 1942 Magazine subscriptions approached or exceeded this point. If every stake and English-speaking Page 48] 482 mission whose subscription rate is less than 75 per cent of the membership will make an effort to increase subscriptions toward this point, it should be possible to keep the Magazine subscription price at one dollar per year. At the end of each row of symbols is a rank number by means of which the corresponding stake or mission may be found in the preceding table, listed in order according to percentage of Magazine subscriptions in relation to members. This table shows, as of 1942, the number of members, number of Magazine subscriptions, and the percentage of subscriptions to members. It also shows the number of subscriptions to be procured during the calendar year 1943 in order for the stake or mission to have a subscription rate equal to 75 per cent of its members, together with the approximate number of Latter-day Saint women in the stake or missionfrom all of whom Magazine subscriptions may be solicited. For example, for the 161 stakes and missions included in the table and chart, a total subscription list of 75,157 would be required to represent 75 per cent of the 100,320 members of Relief Society in these stakes and missions, but there are approximately 165,813 Latter-day Saint women in these same stakes and missions from whom to procure the 75,157 subscriptions. Similar computations may be made in the stakes and missions with respect to their local Relief Societies.
Attention is especially directed to the annual report in the June-July issue of the Magazine, to the table at the bottom of page 425 showing the extent to which Relief Society officers and class leaders subscribe for the Magazine. This table shows that nearly all (97 per cent) of stake officers and board members subscribe for the Magazine, that nearly two-thirds (65 per cent) of the executive officers in wards and branches are Magazine subscribers, and that 81 per cent of the class leaders take the Magazine. Figures are available in every stake, ward, and mission Relief Society annual report for 1942 from which local rates may be computed.
All subscriptions procured by the local Magazine representatives may be included in the count of subscriptions, whether or not the subscribers are members of Relief Society, and also those subscriptions procured within the boundaries of each local ward or branch which are mailed elsewhere, such as gift subscriptions.
It should be borne in mind that as the number of members increases or decreases during 1943, the subscription percentage will also fluctuate. For example, if a stake procures the number of subscriptions listed in the table as representing 75 per cent of the members, the subscription rate for this stake at the end of 1943 would be less than 75 per cent if the number of members has increased, or more than 75 per cent if the number of members has decreased. Magazine representatives should therefore check frequently with their Relief Society secretaries to ascertain the current membership count.
THE high-ranking stakes and missions which procured Magazine subscriptions equal to or exceeding 75 per cent of their members for 1942 head the table. These are the Australian and the Western States Missions, and South Los Angeles, San Diego, Big Horn, San Francisco, Union, Cassia, Phoenix, and Bear Lake Stakes. These stakes and missions are also represented in the Notes from the Field of this issue where they tell of methods used in achieving these rates.
Of the total of 161 stakes and English-speaking missions listed in the table and charts, only these 10 report subscriptions equaling or exceeding 75 per cent of their members. It is especially noteworthy that the Australian Mission and the South Los Angeles Stake each procured subscriptions in excess of their membership. Also worthy of special mention are two districts of the Northern States MissionIllinois North and South with a percentage of 92, and Wisconsin with a percentage of 76, and the South Alabama district of the Southern States Mission with a percentage of 77. Mission districts are not listed separately in the table and chart because not all missions are organized into districts with respect to Relief Society work. These three high-rating mission districts were recognized, however, in the Magazine subscription honor roll in the May issue of the Magazine.
Each year, local Relief Societies, as well as stakes and missions, whose subscriptions to the Relief Society Magazine equal or exceed 75 per cent of the Relief Society membership, are compiled into an honor roll and published in the Magazine. Each local Magazine representative achieving this goal is awarded a one-year gift subscription to the Magazine. This honor roll is based on the annual Magazine subscription reports submitted by local, stake, and mission Magazine representatives.
A total of 383 local Relief Society Magazine representatives achieved a place on the honor roll for 1942 and were awarded gift subscriptions, as shown on the honor roll in the Magazine for May 1943, supplemented by the June-July issue, page 412. But these 383 local Relief Societies (284 of them in stakes and 99 in missions), represented only 17 per cent of the total of 2,273 local Relief Societies throughout the Church. Only 8 or 6 per cent of the 144 stakes achieved a rating of 75 per cent, and only 2 of the missions. The missions, however, cannot all be compared in this respect, inasmuch as several of them are in non-English-speaking countries, and reports from some of the English-speaking missions in faraway places could not reach us under wartime shipping conditions.
Many of the local Relief Societies failed to submit subscription reports to their stake or mission officers, and the General Board received no compiled reports from 99 of the stakes nor from some of the missions from which reports could have reached the office. It is unfortunate that in some of these non-reporting stakes and missions there were local Magazine representatives who had achieved excellent Magazine subscription rates but whose records did not reach the General Board for inclusion in the honor roll either because the local Relief Society failed to submit its report or because the stake or mission failed to send in the compilation.
The rates shown are based on members and subscriptions as shown

in the regular annual report. These figures should have been exactly the same as those submitted on the subscription reports from Relief Society Magazine representatives, but these figures were in agreement in only about one-fourth of the stakes and missions. In all remaining stakes and missions either the count of members or count of subscriptions was in conflict in the two reports. This is surprising inasmuch as there was only one source of information for each figureMagazine representatives were instructed to procure the count of members as of December 1, 1942 from their respective Relief Society secretaries, and secretaries were instructed to procure the count of subscriptions from their respective Magazine representatives. The regular annual Relief Society report must necessarily be considered as the official report and therefore the figures as printed may not agree in all instances with figures submitted by Magazine representatives, including those printed in the honor roll. It is conceded that in many instances the number of subscriptions as reported by Magazine representatives may have been more accurate than the number shown by the secretary on the annual report, but without evidence to this effect the only alternative is to accept for this purpose the figures in the regular annual report. It is hoped that the recognition of this discrepancy will lead to more accurate reports for 1943.
Discrepancies of this sort account for inclusion in the honor roll of two stakes which on the basis of the annual report are not shown in the accompanying table and chart as having achieved a goal of 75 per cent or more.

Magazine Promotion Work
Counselor Belle S. Spafford
THE Relief Society Magazine is published monthly by the General Board for the spiritual, educational, and cultural advancement of Latter-day Saint women, and to further the work of Relief Society. In order for the Magazine to fulfill its purpose, three divisions of Magazine work must be well done:
First, the Magazine itself must be a publication of merit. Contents must be well selected and carefully edited; they must be interesting and profitable to Latter-day Saint women. The Magazine, from cover to cover, must be attractive to the eye, with every detail of such quality as to evoke the pride of publisher and Magazine representative alike; and subscribers should be able to readily recognize it as a high-class and valuable periodical. The publication of an attractive, worthwhile Magazine is made possible through the excellent contributions of gifted and authoritative writers, able artists, and a well-equipped Magazine staff.
Second, the Magazine must be extensively distributed among those for whom it is planned. No matter how splendid it may be, it is of little value unless circulatedand the wider its circulation, the greater is its value. A person will seldom make an effort to possess an article, irrespective of its worth, unless someone arouses his interest in it and points out that it has definite value to him as an individual. This is particularly true with regard to subscribing to a magazine. Someone must make the prospective subscriber
Page 494
appreciate the value of the magazine in relation to his needs; then, a subscription will usually be forthcoming. This work of distribution is the special responsibility of stake and ward officers and Magazine representatives.
Third, the Magazine must not only be circulated, it must be read. Otherwise, it cannot fulfill the purpose for which it is published. Many people have the reading habit and read the Magazine thoroughly without any special stimulation; others read it because they feel a special need for certain information which it contains or for the recreation or entertainment which reading it provides; still others need to be frequently stimulated to read it, or they would seldom open its pages. It is safe to say that the average person reads that which is brought to his attention, and is exceedingly responsive to suggestions from those whose opinions he values. Relief Society officers, Magazine representatives, and Relief Society members may greatly stimulate Magazine reading by calling to the attention of the women, at every favorable opportunity, articles, stories, poems, etc., published in the various issues. Throughout the year, Magazine content should be kept before subscribers in an enthusiastic, converted way.
At this season of the year, the second important phase of Magazine work holds the special attention of many Relief Society officers and Magazine representatives. Although the time for the four-weeks intensive
MAGAZINE PROMOTION WORK
Magazine promotion work is optional, many stakes conduct this program during the fall months, September and October.
In planning this program, one question is uppermost: "How may we be successful in selling the Magazine?" Someone has said, "He who is mentally equipped with a thorough knowledge of the goods he sells and a study of human nature, who possesses an attractive personality, enjoys good health, is absolutely honest, and in love with his work, can hardly fail to make a successful salesman."
IN approaching her work, perhaps the first consideration of the Magazine representative is to determine who may be regarded as prospective subscribers. The Relief Society Magazine is not for Relief Society members alone, but is needed in the home of every Latter-day Saint woman. Every woman in the ward who is not already a subscriber should be regarded as a prospective subscriber. Prospective subscribers might profitably be classified; for example, the probable, the less probable, and the least probable. It has been estimated by successful sales organizations that the most hopeful group of prospects yields fifty times the results over the least hopeful group, in proportion to the time and energy expended.
It is recognized that certain advance information is valuable in selling; for example, the name, the size of the family, approximate ages of family members, the interests, ambitions, and needs of the family, their Church auxiliary affiliations, etc. The Magazine representative should also know the names of those who are
495
already subscribers and the expiration dates of their subscriptions; the names of those who have been but who are not now subscribers and, if possible, the reasons why their subscriptions were discontinued.
Successful Magazine representatives have a clear idea of Magazine content and a strong conviction of the worth of the periodical. "Know and value your merchandise" is a must in successful selling. The Magazine representative should be sufficiently familiar with Magazine content to be able to tell enough of any article, story, etc., to interest a prospective subscriber and to enable that person to see the value of the publication in relation to her individual interests and needs.
The wise Magazine representative gives careful consideration to how best to present the worth of the Magazine in a clear, intelligent, and appealing manner. The special ideas and incitements that might be used with each individual to arouse in her a desire to subscribe are thought through and evaluated. Generally speaking, it is more effective to stress the values to be derived from receiving the Magazine month after month than to merely enumerate, article by article and story by story, the content of one or two issues. It is usually profitable to briefly review one or two articles or stories which strike a point of interest, but to deal with every bit of content, article by article, is highly impractical.
In calling upon a woman in the interest of securing a Magazine subscription, the experienced representative always carries copies of one or two issues of the Magazine with herone of these a current issue. People
496
like to see what they are buying. Good judgment is used in getting a hearing. A time is selected for the interview that is convenient for the prospective subscriber and the visit is not extended too long. However, the representative endeavors not to appear rushed nor does she ever have a demanding attitude.
In selling it is advisable to appeal to the individual interests and needs of each woman solicited. Appeals that have been successfully used in selling The Relief Society Magazine are: (1) activity in Relief Society, (2) interest in homemaking, (3) desire for education, (4) desire to keep up with Church news and viewpoints, (5) desire to be familiar with movements, trends, and activities important to Latter-day Saint women, (6) ambitions for children, (7) need for high-class, entertaining reading matter. These are usually more effective appeals than just loyalty to Relief Society, although the loyalty appeal may be effective where others fail.
The appropriateness of the Magazine as a giftMother's Day, Christmas, birthday, etc.is an appeal which often results in a subscription.
Magazine representatives occasionally encounter objections to buying; such as, "I don't have time to read"; "I already subscribe for more magazines than I read"; "I can't afford to subscribe"; "I take the Era or The Children's Friend, and one Church magazine is enough," etc. The wise representative anticipates these objections and is fortified to dissolve them without argumentation; she has an answer ready that will casually set the objection at nought. A favorable comment of someone whose
RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINEAUGUST 1943
opinion is respected, often removes such an objection. Frequently, the strongest objections are overcome by leaving a sample copy of the Magazine in the home.
Copies of some back issues are now available upon request at the office of the General Board, and representatives are urged to take advantage of this offer.
Business-like procedure is extremely important in selling. A receipt book, a good pencil or other needed supplies should always be at hand and necessary information should be accurately recorded. Thus the representative wins the confidence of the subscriber and avoids mistakes.
The spirit with which Relief Society Magazine representatives approach their work has perhaps been responsible for more sales than any other one factor. They regard their work as an important Relief Society call, far-reaching in its influence. They take pleasure in showing the Magazine, striving always to make a friend for the periodical and for Relief Society even though they may not always make a sale. They recognize in their assignment a work of service, worthy of their time and best effort.
The following articles published in The Relief Society Magazine contain helpful suggestions for selling. While some of these articles deal primarily with suggestions for stimulating the work through the union meeting, they contain enough help for ward representatives to justify a careful reading of them.
