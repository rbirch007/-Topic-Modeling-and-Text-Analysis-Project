Anniversary of Salt Lake Temple Dedication
IT is with feelings of deep gratitude and thanksgiving to our Heavenly Father that the members of the Relief Society will recall on April 6, 1943, the fiftieth anniversary of the dedication of the Salt Lake Temple. In speaking of the Salt Lake Temple, Brigham Young once said:
I want this temple that we are now building to the name of our God, to stand for all time to come as a monument of the industry, faithfulness, faith, and integrity of the Latter-day Saints who were driven into the mountains.
During the fifty years since the dedication of this sacred edifice, many of the women of the Church have labored long and earnestly in this temple for themselves and their dead. The best way to express our feelings to the Lord on the great privileges and blessings which are ours this day in being permitted to enter temples and receive endowments therein is to show forth an increase of diligence and works in laboring in our temples.
