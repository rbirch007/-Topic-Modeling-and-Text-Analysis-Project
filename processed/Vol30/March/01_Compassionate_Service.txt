Compassionate Service
Elder George Albert Smith Member of the Council of the Twelve
"Inasmuch as ye do it unto the least of these."
ONE hundred years ago, in the then thriving city of Nauvoo, Illinois, the greatest association in the world for the benefit of women was brought into being. Organized by the Prophet Joseph Smith, who two years later gave his life as a martyr for truth, this splendid benevolent association has continued to grow until today it numbers 115,000 of the most unselfish and intelligent women to be found in the world.
The city of its birth, at that time the largest in the state of Illinois, had a population of more than 20,000. It was later destroyed by mob violence and the good people responsible for building and naming it were driven into the wilderness. They traveled more than 1500 miles over the plains and mountains, through a country infested with Indians and wild animals. They arrived in the desolate Salt Lake Valley and began again to lay the foundation of civilization.
Today Nauvoo is a village of approximately 1,000 people, without a railroad or street car line. But the Relief Society that was cruelly driven out with the Church has continued to grow until it has units in hundreds of cities and villages in many parts of the world. For each individual now living in Nauvoo, the Relief Society has more than 100 members. They are fine citizens of many nations and islands of the sea. The teachings and ideals of the Society are an inspiration to all women who apply them in their lives, regardless of where they live or to what race or creed they may belong. No matter how many virtues one may possess, the teachings of the Society encourage the acquisition of more, perfection being the ultimate aim.
Your General Presidents have been great souls, worthy to be called daughters of God. They have been chosen because of their intelligence and willingness to serve unselfishly for the benefit of all, and they have sought to surround themselves with women who have been willing, if necessary, to travel to the remote

parts of the earth to supervise the organization of societies to teach the mothers of men how to fit into the responsibilities of earth life in a manner pleasing to our Heavenly Father.
I have witnessed the results of Relief Society influence at home and abroad. My soul has been filled with gratitude as I have observed the development of those who are attempting to measure up to the standards set by our Heavenly Father for his daughters in the progressive program of this great organization.
My travels have taken me from Alaska and Norway in the far north to Australia and New Zealand in the far south, and to many of the nations between. I have found the Relief Society operating for the benefit of all who would participate both in and out of the Church. The Organization has functioned as an auxiliary in the largest and strongest wards of the Church and in the smallest branches in all parts of the world where the Gospel has been taught. It has been an aid to the Priesthood and the women have assisted in all charitable work, particularly caring for their own sex. In many nations and upon the islands of the sea I have observed the members of your society in action, encouraging the despondent, pleading with the wayward, praying with the sick and disabled, always unselfishly seeking the guidance and inspiration of the Almighty for the soul in distress. Their ministrations are all-inclusive from the cradle to the grave.
In remote branches of the Church your associates have traveled through the heat of summer and the cold of winter to minister to the helpless and
needy. They have waded through the mud and the snow, entirely unmindful of their own discomfort, to nurse the sick, and in hundreds of cases assuage the pain of women in labor, and, in the absence of a doctor or trained nurse, have delivered babies and cared for the mother successfully.
The development and accomplishments of the women of this sisterhood are almost like a fairy tale, so unusual is the story. Women hold a place in civilization no less important than men, and but for their modesty and reserve, they would often supersede men in many important positions in government and industry.
THE program of the Relief Society is developed in the interest of all people. Realizing that the home is the foundation of civilization and happiness, these women exert a modifying influence calculated to make our homes havens of rest and peace. All those dwelling therein may enjoy, in some measure, a taste of what heaven will be. Not only does the Society function as a benevolent organization but it aims to develop in the human soul a love of true religion. It encourages an appreciation of art, literature, music, science, and the beautifying and sanctifying of home. This and much more that enriches life is a part of the Relief Society plan. True education in every essential is sought after. Women who have excelled in some department of life gladly share their information with those less fortunate, the result being that the second and third generations have often enjoyed advantages they could not have had but for the
COMPASSIONATE SERVICE
generous women who have made them possible. The advice of the Prophet was that women should "provoke the brethren to good works." In times like these the members of the Relief Society should encourage their husbands and sons to do their full duty in sustaining the ideals of the Church and the nation, and in doing their full part to maintain what is still left of civilization.
The self-sacrifice of the members has been a bulwark against selfishness and has been a great strength to the Church from the time of its inception. Cheerfulness is a characteristic of the sisters who visit among the people, and because of their love and tactfulness many a dull day has been brightened in homes where women were sad and where, due to overwork and other distresses, women were discouraged.
No other group in all the world has rendered more desirable service in time of need. In all parts of the world women have discharged their obligations as wives and mothers, looking largely to the benefits to be derived in mortality; but I know of no other organization that programs for and insists that women should be given opportunities equal to men in the same wholesome way that has been enjoyed by your membership. The lives of women in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and that of course means all our women, have been precious to the men because they expect to have their companionship throughout the ages of eternity.
UPON one occasion I was talking to a man who was a great philanthropist. The question of 
155
marriage entered into the conversation and I explained to him that the marriage that was recognized as a Church marriage by the Latter-day Saints was one not only for time but for eternity. I told him that we expect to enjoy our family life in immortality, to associate with one another as parents and children in the Celestial Kingdom right here on this earth throughout the ages of eternity. I explained that in due time all expected to pass away; but the Lord had revealed to us that those who were worthy would be permitted to continue their lives in immortality upon this earth when it has been cleansed and purified and becomes the Celestial Kingdom. Husbands will have their wives, wives will have their husbands, and parents and children will enjoy eternal companionship.
I will never forget the fervor with which he expressed himself when he said, "If all the world could know that and believe it, what a difference it would make in the treatment that men and women would accord to each other, and that parents would bestow upon their children."
These things are known to Relief Society sisters, and knowing it, you have power to bring peace and comfort, happiness and satisfaction, to those who need you where other women would fail entirely. You are to be congratulated that you possess the knowledge that every good thing that the people of the world enjoy, you may enjoy, and in addition that you may draw near to your Heavenly Father in prayer, and begin the consecration of your lives right here on earth and be prepared for eternal happiness in the Celestial Kingdom.

Your strength is not in might but in the power of righteousness. The faithful, progressive members of Relief Society will be given added courage and strength to meet the problems of today that parallel those which confronted the Relief Society in its inception. In the beginning you were asked to help in the Latter-day Saint struggle for freedom and progress. Today you do not have to struggle alone, but lend your efforts, and lead the way for millions of women throughout this war torn world who are giving their all to preserve freedom and democracy.
In different parts of the world families are being exiled. Men and women are being shipped to war zones. The adversary of all righteousness is spreading destruction. The devoted women of the Society may wield great influence in strengthening their husbands, brothers, and sons in their patriotic contributions and their determination to be worthy of their heritage.
It is not only your privilege but your duty, as the hard-working domestic executive in your family, to take advantage of every intelligent program placed in your hands. New, modern, scientific courses in nutrition are available without expense. Be certain that you transfer your training into your daily life, thus protecting your families from malnourishment in the lean years ahead. The current courses in nursing will teach you to skilfully care for your own afflicted loved ones in a correct manner. Thus it will relieve the crowded condition in hospitals and leave more space for the acutely afflicted who need skilled and scientific attention.
It is important that you complete the new course in first aid and canteen work. No one can tell when or where that information may be of utmost value to you or your community. Nurses' aids are needed in local hospitals all over the nation to help replace those who have left for active war duty. This instruction is available, and whenever and wherever you have the time, training, and opportunity, it is desirable for you to volunteer in this fine humanitarian service.
By doing home canning you will relieve the pressure on industry. More canned foods will be available for our own armed forces and our oppressed Allies. It is essential that your ward emergency program be completed, your war chest filled, and first-aid kits prepared for every home situated in dangerous areas. All of these things are "firsts." Then if your time, talents, and energy can be budgeted to help in the war industry and you can make this additional contribution, knowing your home is not neglected, do so and our Heavenly Father will reward you for your added efforts.
No matter where you work or in what manner you serve, be sure that you keep your word. Give 100 per cent service and always be dependable. Once you have accepted an assignment, no matter how large or small, never fail to perform your part. You may think that you are only a small link in the chain of cooperative effort but remember no chain is stronger than its weakest link.
AS you face the second year of the second century of Relief Society
COMPASSIONATE SERVICE
follow the pattern of your sisters who started the first year of the first century, and anchor your faith in God. Be helpful, prayerful, humble, and full of courage. Democracy is at stake, and it will be your duty to bolster the morale of your own families, allay their fears, supplant terror and uncertainty with faith, and smilingly meet the dawn of each day until victory is won.
I have no way of expressing to you my admiration and appreciation for the wonderful service that your
157
organization has rendered under almost every conceivable circumstance through which men and women are required to pass. In the palaces of the rich and in the modest homes of the poor, you radiate the same sweet influence and bestow the same smile of approbation for the good things that you see as you mingle among your associates. The riches of eternity will flow to every one of you, who, as a daughter of Zion, honors her Heavenly Father and seeks to be worthy of His love.
