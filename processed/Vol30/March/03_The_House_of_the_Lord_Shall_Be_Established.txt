The House of the Lord Shall Be Established in the Top of the Mountains
Ann P. Nibley Member of Relief Society General Board
THE annual conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, held in April, 1893, fifty years ago, was an historic event. It was the occasion of the completion and dedication of the great Salt Lake Temple. For more than forty years the Saints had labored, under almost insurmountable difficulties, to complete this sacred structure; now it was finished, and stood as "an object of wonder, and admiration to the visitor, and a subject of sanctifying joy and righteous pride to the people, whose sacrifice and effort had given it being."
On July 28, 1847, four days after the arrival of the first group of pioneers, on the desolate site which is now beautiful Salt Lake City, President Brigham Young, while walking over the ground where the temple now stands, thrust his cane into the parched soil and exclaimed, 'Here we will build the Temple of our God." From that time this place became known as Temple Block and the people looked upon it as "hallowed ground."
At the general conference of the Church in April 1851, the construction of the temple was approved by official vote. Let us remember that this decision was made by a group of impoverished and isolated people, menaced by hostile Indians and struggling for existence in a desert land. Because of these many difficulties and hardships the work was delayed until almost six years after the arrival of the pioneers. On February 14, 1853, when the site was finally dedicated and the ground was broken, the occasion was one of greatest rejoicing. On the 6th of April, 1853, the corner stones were laid. During these ceremonies of thanksgiving many civic and military organizations took part, "there were processions with bands of music and solemn services with prayer."
However, the work now so eagerly begun was not to be continued without further delay. In the spring of 1858 the coming of Johnston's Army to Utah "had been heralded with dire threats of violence,"the saints had not forgotten the "harrowing scenes" of persecution in Missouri and Illinois and rather than suffer a repetition of these events they prepared to abandon their homes and seek refuge in the desert. "In the saddening preparation for departure the people carefully covered the foundation work on the site of the Temple; excavations were refilled and every vestige of masonry was obscured.... When the covering up process was complete, the site showed nothing more attractive than a remote resemblance

to the barren stretch of a roughly plowed field."
Fortunately a peaceable agreement was made between the people and the army, and in July 1858 the Saints returned to their homes. Later when resuming the work on the temple it was found that the material used in the foundation was not of a stable character. Consequently, by years of toil it was removed, and stone of better quality was substituted. In 1877, at which time the granite walls of the great structure had reached a height of twenty feet,
President Brigham Young, the beloved leader, passed away. For another decade the work was carried on by his successor, President John Taylor and thereafter was continued under the direction of Wilford Woodruff, the fourth president of the Church. Work now went on with little interruption. However circumstances at times conspired to retard and make the progress slow, "but when in place of three or four yoke of oxen being necessary to the transportation of a single stone from the quarry twenty miles distant, there came the change of conditions wrought by the railroad, the walls grew with greater rapidity and when at length the time came for the laying of the capstone... The anxiety of the people to complete the structure seemed to burst forth like a pent up flood."
On April 6, 1892, at one of the greatest gatherings ever to take place in Utah, the capstone of the temple was placed in position. "The day marked the close of the annual conference, and was hallowed by all the observances of solemn assembly. As a preliminary to the principal ceremony, a vast congregation had assembled in the Tabernacle at an early hour, and in this assembly the several organizations of the Priesthood occupied distinctive places on the main floor while the galleries were reserved for the accommodations of the general public.
"At the close of an impressive service the multitude proceeded in formal procession to the open space on the south side of the Temple, where a temporary platform had been erected with the flag of the nation waving above. An adjoining stand accommo-

dated the choir which numbered over 200 singers. There was band music of the highest order and every essential element of fervent worship combined with joyous celebration had been provided."
Over 40,000 people were on the Temple Block to celebrate this occasion, while many thousands more, unable to find a place, stood in the streets or looked down from windows and roofs of surrounding buildings. One year from this notable event the last "finishing touches" to the interior of the sacred and beloved structure were made, and on the evening of the 5th of April, the day preceding the dedication, the majestic temple, now completed, was opened for general inspection. On this occasion not only were members of the Church admitted but hundreds of "honorable" men and women who did not belong to the Church were invited to pass through.
When the great day for the dedication arrived, the Saints gathered

from far and near until it was estimated that at least 25,000 people had come to the city to witness the ceremonies. Elder James E. Talmage relates: "On the morning of the 6th of April, 1893, Wilford Woodruff, President of the Church, led the way through the southwest door into the sacred precincts.... He was followed by general authorities of the Church. And these in turn by other Church officials and such members as had been especially designated to take part in the first dedication service. Of the tens of thousands of Saints who desired to be present, whose rightful privilege it was to attend, but few could be accommodated on the day of the dedication. The assembly room, which with its vestries occupies the entire floor, had been furnished with seating accommodations for 2,252 persons. It was arranged therefore that services be repeated twice daily to continue from April 6th until all who were

entitled to admission had had opportunity to be present."
At the first service, the official dedication, the dedicatory prayer was offered by President Wilford Woodruff. This dedicatory prayer was read at each succeeding session. One paragraph of this beautiful prayer follows:
"We come before Thee with joy and thanksgiving, with spirits jubilant and hearts filled with praise, that Thou has permitted us to see this day, for which, during these forty years, we have hoped and toiled and prayed, when we can dedicate unto Thee this house, which we have built to Thy most glorious name. One year ago we set the capstone, with shouts of Hosanna to God and the Lamb. And today we dedicate the whole unto Thee, with all that pertains unto it, that it may be holy in Thy sight; that it may be a house of prayer, a house of praise and of worship; that Thy glory may rest upon it; that Thy Holy Presence may be continually in it; that it may be the abode of Thy Well-Beloved Son, our Savior; that the angels who stand before Thy face may be the hallowed messengers who shall visit it, bearing to us Thy wishes and Thy will, that it may be sanctified and consecrated in all its parts unto Thee, the God of Israel, the Almighty ruler of mankind. And we pray Thee that all people who enter upon the threshold of this, Thine house, may feel Thy power, and be constrained to acknowledge that Thou hast sanctified it, that it is Thy house."
"This prayer itself is at once a sermon and a supplication; it is expressive of the inmost thoughts of the people; it is an epitome of the history
of the Saints and the condition of the Church at the time....
"A large pipe organ had been set up in the assembly room, and served as an accompaniment to the Choir of [300] selected voices, by whom the anthems and the hymns, especially composed for the occasion were rendered. The essential and characteristic feature of the service was, of course, the offering of the dedicatory prayer, and to this were added brief addresses by officials of the Church. Throughout the service ran the solemn refrain, which was voiced in anthem, sermon, and prayer: "THE HOUSE OF THE LORD IS COMPLETED."
These words were uttered by Elder B. H. Roberts at the conference meeting preceding the dedication: "As the ruins of the Temples erected by the ancient inhabitants of this land today, testify of a God fearing people, so will the Salt Lake Temple stand for centuries to come as a grand monument of the faith, union, and unselfishness of the Saints of the Latter-days; and preach to the stranger who shall visit our beautiful valley in times to come, a sermon so powerful and convincing, that thousands will acknowledge the hand of the Lord in connection with the labor performed by the Saints, and lead them to embrace the truth."
Ages ago, in far off Judea, the Prophet Micah predicted that "in the last days the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it..." The dedication of the Salt Lake Temple marked the fulfillment of this ancient prophecy.
