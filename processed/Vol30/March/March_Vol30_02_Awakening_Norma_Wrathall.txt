AWAKENING
Norma Wrathall
Before warm April's sun begins to glow Trees send their sap above the melting snow; Long dormant roots arouse, make haste at last Deep into yielding earth, now winter's past; While yet it's cold the pussy willows start; Trees know when it is spring; so may the heart, Roused from old grief or from dreams half begun, Send living tendrils to faith's glowing sun.
