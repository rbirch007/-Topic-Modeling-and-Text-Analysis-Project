YONA DANSIE, counselor in the East Mill Creek Ward Relief Society, of which Elvie B. Berg is president, reports:
A unique feature of the bazaar held November 19, 1942 was a booth decorated with copies of Theand A Centenary of Relief Society. Seventy-five copies of the centennial book were sold and several subscriptions to Thewere taken. A surprising feature of this booth was the number of men who bought the centennial book and subscribed for the Magazine for their wives and mothers.

SCENE, "THE TREK ACROSS THE PLAINS"
From the pageant "One Hundred Years of Progress" presented by the Relief Society of the Mount Olympus Ward, Big Cottonwood Stake, March 17, 1943.
two large tables with lace covers, centered with flowers in Relief Society colors, blue and gold, and tall yellow candles which shed their light over the crystal and silver appointments of the table. A large punch bowl was surrounded by dainty and varied open-faced sandwiches, nuts and mints, and individual ice creams and cakes. Blue napkins carried, in gold, the monogram of the stake Relief Society. Each guest was given a blue and gold corsage.
The program, a dramatic presentation of the play "Junior Miss," was enjoyed by the many mothers present. Solos were given by Virginia Paulk.
A beautiful tribute was paid each past stake Relief Society president by Sister Laura Stephens who had worked with each of these presidents. Each past stake president spoke in turn and introduced her counselors and secretary. I am sure all present pledged within themselves to rededicate their time and talents to the work of our wonderful organization.

THE accompanying picture shows a scene from the play, "Relief Society Songs," presented by the Pleasant View Ward Relief Society at an outing of the Sharon Stake, on August 19, 1941. The play was written by Sister Celestia J. Taylor, a member of the ward. She was assisted by Sisters Diantha T. Ekins and Inez W. Muhlestein, who spent long hours at libraries doing research relating to song history and compiling information upon which the play was based. These sisters also directed the play and arranged for the scenery and staging. The report of this play was submitted by Anna T. Nielsen, president of the Pleasant View Ward Relief Society.

CARBON STAKE RELIEF SOCIETY BOARD
Photographed at close of recognition program held in connection with the Relief Society session of the stake quarterly conference, June 28, 1942. The president,
Belle Johnson, is in the center, with her counselors, Belle McAllister and Hettie Bent on either side. Than one hundred ward members participated as members of the cast, in the Singing Mothers' chorus, in a male quartette, and in other musical numbers. In eight scenes, the pageant depicted the organization, growth, and activities of the Relief Society during its 101 years. The accompanying picture shows a part of the scene, "The Trek Across the Plains." There was much enthusiasm shown and it is felt that working together on this venture brought about greater unity and cooperation in the ward as well as in the Society. Carbon Stake (Utah) BELLE JOHNSON, Carbon Stake Relief Society president, and Estella McIntire, membership coordinator, report that a special program of recognition of the accomplishments of the wards of this stake during the four-year membership-building program was held in connection with the Relief Society session of the stake quarterly conference during the summer of 1942. The part of the program which was devoted to the recognition of achievements and presentation of awards was carried out in thyme. The report continues: The Singing Mothers and other music were under the direction of Stake Chorister Mary Hansen. The talk suggested in the program outlined by the General Board was given by Counselor Belle McAllister, and the scriptural reading, with music, by Assistant Secretary Ardes McQueen. President Belle Johnson gave the president's report and the rest of the time was given to the recognitions and awards. The hall was decorated in white roses and baby breath. Two arches made of white flowers were placed over the pulpit, forming a beautiful canopy for those taking part. There was a part on the program for. Each of the stake board members and also for those being honored.  NOTES FROM THE FIELD 571 THE RIGBY STAKE RELIEF SOCIETY Planting an American weeping beech tree on the grounds of the new Idaho Falls Temple, April 24, 1943Awards were made to Mabel Livingstone of the Third Ward Relief Society for the best Relief Society scrapbook in the stake; to Junie Allred, also of the Third Ward.

Two little girls dressed in blue and gold carried the certificates of award in daintily decorated baskets to the honored ones. This was followed by a candle-lighting ceremony which was one of the highlights of the program. The stake scrapbook was a work of art and was on display during and after the program for the benefit of the congregation. The program was planned by the stake board and written up in rhyme by Assistant Secretary Ardes McQueen. Rigby Stake (Idaho) STELLA F. BROSSARD, Relief Society stake secretary-treasurer submitted the following report of the tree-planting ceremony held by the Rigby Stake Relief Society, which planted a tree on the grounds of the new Idaho Falls Temple: The tree-planting ceremony of the Rigby Stake Relief Society was held Saturday, April 24, 1943, at 4:00 p. M. On the Latter-day Saint Temple grounds at Idaho Falls, Idaho. The tree, donated to the Temple grounds by the Rigby Stake Relief Society, is an American weeping beech. Forty persons were present at the ceremony, including Elders H. T. Moss and O. S. Cordon, formerly of the Rigby Stake presidency; Elder Lyman J. Ball, high councilman who is Relief Society advisor; the former Relief Society stake president, Lettie E. Call; and Elder Robert F. Woller, temple gardener. President Phoebe Cordon presided. The following program was presented: Congregation sang "Our Mountain Home So Dear," led by Sister Geneva Snow. Invocation was offered by High Councilman Lyman J. Ball. Words of welcome and appreciation were said by President Phoebe Cordon. Stake Board Member Elva Ball read the history of the specie of the American weeping beech tree on the grounds of the new Idaho Falls Temple, April 24, 1943. VISITING TEACHERS OF THE RICHFIELD THIRD WARD, SEVIER STAKE, Who achieved a record of 100 per cent visiting teaching during 1941-42. Vocal trio composed of Geneva Snow, Sylvia Jones, and Mabel Fillmore sang Joyce Kilmer's poem, "Trees.'"' The dedicatory prayer was offered by Elder H. T. Moss. Sevier Stake (Utah) THE Sevier Stake Relief Society submitted the following report of an entertainment for the visiting teachers of the Richfield Third Ward held in July 1942: Under the leadership of the ward Relief Society president, Georgia Ogden, and her counselors, Myrtle Curtis and Ruby Nielson, a unique entertainment was given for the visiting teachers of the Richfield Third Ward. Sister Curtis was in direct charge of the arrangements. 'Thirty-four of the thirty-eight visiting teachers were in attendance. Sisters Myrl Brugger, Sevier Stake Relief Society president, and Martha Hunt, stake leader of visiting teachers, were present by special invitation. The entertainment was given in appreciation for the fine work done by the visiting teachers of this ward, who achieved a record of 100 per cent visiting for the year. A telephone conversation carried on by the ward president, seated at one end of the table with Everdena Winkel, ward sponsor at the other end, explained the purpose of the entertainment, presented the high ideals and standards of Relief Society work, and expressed appreciation of the willing and efficient work that had been carried on by: the ward visiting teachers. Another feature of the entertainment was the spelling of the word TEACHER, each assigned member giving her own interpretation and meaning of each letter in regard to the visiting teachers' work. The contributions offered on this part of the program were original and varied in form and length. Light refreshments, singing, and games added much to the entertainment of the afternoon. Liberty Stake (Utah) EDNA P. PULHAM, secretary treasurer of Liberty Stake Relief Society, submitted the following report: The Liberty Stake Relief Society Board entertained the ward presidencies at a delightful luncheon, Thursday, September 17, 1942, in the Lion House. The occasion was in the nature of a fall festival, expressing gratitude for the bounties of life. In keeping with this idea, the tables were  NOTES FROM THE FIELD 573 RELIEF SOCIETY OF LA GRANDE FIRST WARD, UNION STAKE (OREGON) TAKEN AT CLOSING SOCIAL, MAY 26, 1942 Seated directly behind the basket of flowers at the right is Viola Fullmer, with her counselors, Julia Decker and Katie Weimer on either side. Seated at the extreme right is Mina Larson, who preceded Sister Fullmer as president, and seated at the extreme left is Edith Stoddard, who served for many years as president of this ward Relief Society.

Beautifully decorated with fruits and vegetables cut in numerous patterns, depicting stars and flowers. Each plate was marked with a place card, and a nosegay consisting of radish rosebuds and green parsley, with a paper lace background tied with red ribbon. The master centerpiece consisted of a huge basket of fruit. On each end of the table was a large bowl of endive, on which vegetables, cut in various shapes to represent flowers, were arranged. These unique decorations were the work of a decoration committee of which Gardie Standing, stake board member, was chairman. Stake Relief Society President Emma G. Phillips presided. The program was opened by the group singing "One Hundred Thousand Strong," under the leadership of Stake Chorister Margaret Stockman and Stake Organist Agnes Duffin. The invocation was by Louise H. Weilenmann, president of the Liberty Ward. After an address of welcome by Gertrude R. Michelsen of the stake presidency, the time was turned over to our capable toastmistress, Diana R. Lambert, a board member. [Since that time, Sister Lambert has succeeded Sister Michelsen as counselor. The harvest idea was also carried out in the toasts which were as follows: "The PeachOur Heritage," by Mildred P. Elggren, a member of the stake presidency; "The PearOur Responsibility as Mothers of the Home Front," by Lillie B. Forsgren, president of the Harvard Ward; "WheatOur Achievements of Yesterday," by Elda D. Miller, president of the Third Ward; "The AppleOur Pledge to the Future," by Reta T.

The missionaries and branch Priesthood members enjoyed a softball game before the picnic lunch. The accompanying picture of the Relief Society members was taken at this outing. We have all enjoyed in "Notes From the Field" the pictures of our friends in the wards and stakes at home, and hope some $75 of them will still remember those of us who have been in the mission fields many years, but: still call Utah "Home." JEANETTE LANDERMAN, secretary of the Corpus Christi Branch Relief Society, reports: The Corpus Christi Branch Relief Society held its first bazaar Saturday evening, December 12, 1942. A chicken dinner was served; a fine program of songs, dances, and oratory was presented; and various games and dancing made the evening complete. Weare all ready to begin on articles for our 1943 bazaar. We have a beautiful spirit of love, charity, faith, and toil among our sisters here. SO YOUNG A BRIDE Anna Prince Redd So young a bride!

Sheology Articles of Faith Lesson 19  Zion Tuesday, December 7, 1943 (This is the third chapter dealing with Article 10) Article 10""We believe... Continent, * * *" that Zion will be built upon this (the American) Lesson Aim: To show that the work of the Lord will cover the whole earth, and two capitals-will be established, one on the eastern and one on the western hemisphere, both of which will be Zion. CONDENSATION OF CHAPTER 19, TALMAGE'S ARTICLES OF FAITH Two Gathering Places Some of the passages quoted in connection with the dispersion and the subsequent gathering of Israel make reference to Jerusalem, which is to be re-established, and Zion, which is to be built. True, the latter name is in many cases used as a synonym of the first, owing to the fact that a certain hill within Jerusalem of old was known specifically as Zion, or Mount Zion; and the name of a part is often used figuratively to designate the whole; but in other passages the separate and distinctive meaning of the terms is clear. Micah predicted the destruction of Jerusalem and its associated Zion (Micah Page 576 3:12), and then announced a new condition that is to exist in the last days, when another "mountain of the house of the Lord" is to be established and this is to be called Zion (Micah 4:1-2; Isaiah 2:2-3) Joel (Joel 3:16). Zephaniah (Zeph. 3: 14-16),' Zechariah (Zech. 1:17; 2:7- 12), Isaiah ( Isa. 4:3-4; 40:9), as well as other prophets, have looked forward toward Zion and Jerusalem. The Name "Zion" By derivation, Zion probably meant bright or sunny; but this commonplace signification, is lost in the deeper and more affecting meaning LESSON DEPARTMENT that the word as a name and title came to acquire. The name has been applied as follows: 1. To the hill itself, or Mount Zion, and, by extension of meaning, to Jerusaiem. 2. To the location of the "mountain of the house of the Lord," which Micah predicts shall be established in the last days, distinct from Jerusalem. To these we may add another application of the name as made known through moder revelation, ViZ.: 3. To the City of Holiness, founded by Enoch, the seventh patriarch in descent from Adam, and called by him Zion. (Pearl of Great Price, Moses 7:18-21 ) 4. Yet another use of the term is to be noteda metaphorical oneby which the Church of God is called Zion, comprising, according to the Lord's own definition, the pure in heart (Doctrine and Covenants 97: 21). Jerusalem "Jerusalem" is generally believed to mean by derivation the foundation or city of peace. We meet it for the first time as Salem, the abode of Melchizedek, high priest and king, to whom Abram paid tithes (Gen. 14:18-20). During the reigns of David and Solomon, the city as the capital of the undivided kingdom acquired great fame for its riches, beauty, and strength, its chief attraction being the imposing Temple of Solomon, (see I Kings, chaps. 5-8; 2 Chron., chaps. 2-7). Again will the ancient city become a royal seat, her throne that of the King of Kings, 577 with permanency of glory assured. The Latter-day Zion; New Jerusalem Biblical statements concerning the Zion of the last days, as separate from both the ancient and re-estabished Jerusalem of the east, are silent regarding the geographical location of this second and latter day capital of Christ's kingdom. We learn something, however, from the Bible as to the physical characteristics of the region wherein Zion is to be built. It is explicit regarding the mountainous character of the country of modern Zion which is to be an ensign to the world. (Micah 4: 1-2; Isa. 2:2-3; 33:15-17; 18:1-3). The teachings of the Book of Mormon, and the truths made known through revelation in 'the present dispensation ate more explicit in regard to location. In these scriptures, the names Zion and New Jerusalem are used synonymously, the latter designation being given in honor of Jerusalem of the east. John the Revelator (Rev. 21:2), and Ether (Ether 13:3-8) foretell the establishment of this New Jerusalem, as did Jesus Christ when visiting the Nephites in America, soon after his resurrection (3 Nephi 20:22; 21: 22-24). Ether the Jaredite, and John the Revelator, separated by more than six centuries of time and prophesying on opposite hemispheres, each saw the New Jerusalem come down from heaven "prepared," says the Jewish apostle "'as a bride adorned for her husband" (Rev. 21:2). "The Church in this day teaches that the return of this city from the heavens in glory, is the return of exalted Enoch and his righteous people; and that the people of the Zion of Enoch, 576 and the modern Zion, or the gathered saints on the western continent, will become one people. Latter-day revelation has designated Independence, Missouri, as the "center place" of Zion (Doctrine and Covenants 57:1-5). On August 3, 1831, the temple-site was dedicated by the prophet, Joseph Smith, and his associates in the Priesthood. Great events are to mark the latter days: Zion shall yet be established on this chosen site, and "shall not be moved out of her place," and the pure in heart, shall return "with songs of everlasting joy, to build up the waste places of Zion." (Doctrine and Covenants 101:17-18, 43, 74, 75; 103:1, 11; 136:18). Zion is to be chastened, but only for a little season (Doctrine and Covenants 100:13). Redemption will come, but it is to be determined according to the faithfulness of the people (Doctrine and Covenants 105:9). As long ago as 1834 came the word of the Lord unto the Church: "Behold I say unto you, were it not for the transgressions of my people, speaking concerning the Church and not individuals, they might have been redeemed even now" (Doctrine and Covenants 105:1-2). SUGGESTIONS FOR CLASS PROCEDURE Suggested Songs "Zion Stands with Hills Surrounded" by Kelly, Relief Society Songs, page 8; Deseret Sunday School Songs, page 126. "Zion Prospers, All Is Well". By E. R. Snow, Deseret Sunday School Songs, page 153.; "Beautiful Zion, Built Above," J. G. Fones, Deseret Sunday School Songs, page 92. "The Song of the Redeemed" by Evan Stephens, Relief Society Songs. Page 83. "Redeemer of Israel" by W. W. Phelps, Relief Society Songs, page 37; Deseret Sunday School Songs, Baee 135% Two Gathering Places Visualized Have a five-minute report on the geography of Jerusalem and another report about Independence, Missouri, showing pictures of each locality. If any class or ward members have visited either of these places choose them, if possible, to make the reports. A Committee of Specialists Six representative members of the class could be selected by the class leadr well in advance of the lesson to become specialists on the chapter "Zion." They should do extensive reading and research on this subject. On the theology day, they should each have with them their detailed notes, their Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants, and should be familiar enough with the references to find passages quickly. They should be seated at a table in the front of the class. The class leader should direct the procedure of the hour, using the committee members to answer questions, make explanations, etc., to bring out the points of the lesson. Note: The above procedure suggested for the six members might be LESSON DEPARTMENT adopted, in part, by all members of the class. "To be thoroughly acquainted with the lesson is to be thoroughly interested in it." 'The class 579 members should be urged to familiarize themselves with the lesson and to bring to class the standard works of our Church each theology lesson day. SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL The time is soon coming, when no man will have any peace but in Zion and her stakes. (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, page 161.) And what is Zion? In one sense Zion is the pure in heart. But is there a land that ever will be called Zion? Yes, brethren. What land is it? It is the land that the Lord gave to Jacob, who bequeathed it to his son Joseph, and his posterity, and they inhabit it, and that land is North and South America. That is Zion, as to land, as to territory, and location. The children of Zion have not yet much in their possession, but their territory is North and South America to begin with. As to the spirit of - Zion, it is in the hearts of the Saints of those who love and serve the Lord with all their might, mind and strength. (Discourses of Brigham Young, edition of 1925, pages 183-184.) We want all the Latter-day Saints to understand how to build up Zion. The City of Zion, in beauty and magnificence, will outstrip anything that is now known upon the earth. The curse will be taken from the earth and sin and corruption will be swept from its face. Who will do this great work? Is the Lord going to convince the people that he will redeem the center Stake of Zion, beautify it and then place them there without an exertion on their part? No. He will not come here to build a Temple, a Tabernacle, a Bowery, or to set out fruit trees, make aprons of fig leaves or coats of skins, or work in brass and iron, for we already know how to do these things. He will not come here to teach us how to raise and manufacture cotton, how to make hand cards, how to card, how to make spinning machines, looms, etc., etc. We have to build up Zion, if we do our duty. (Discourses of Brigham Young, edition of 1925, page 184.)

Lesson 3Freedom of Choice
Tuesday, December 7, 1943
FREEDOM of choice develops people, makes them strong and self-reliant. They must think and act for themselves. Free agency is a basic principle in man's development. Without it, he can never reach the high destiny marked out for him. The right to choose his course in life, to say how he will worship and whom, to walk the earth as a free man, are some of the reasons, if not the principal ones, why
580
this great war is being waged. In the august council held in Heaven before the world was framed or man appeared upon its surface, Satan sought to rob us of our agency. He and his followers were defeated, and the forces of righteousness and truth were triumphant. They were victorious in that contest, and they will always ultimately prevail.
Man's development rests upon his agency. Democratic government is built upon the fundamental idea that men are able to govern themselves, that they are happier when they do it, that no man has the right to govern another man without that man's consent, that enforced obedience is not only contrary to the will and purpose of the Almighty, but contrary to man's highest happiness. If the individual has not the power of choice, if he is denied his agency, how can he be held accountable for something he cannot do? We are given to know right from wrong and are free to choose.
Our Heavenly Father never resorts to force or compulsion.
He'll call, persuade, direct aright, And bless with wisdom, love, and light; In nameless ways be good and kind, But never force the human mind.
We all have the right of choice, but when a choice is once made, we are responsible for the consequences.
These questions may arise: Why are we subject to temptation? Why is the world made hard? The world is made hard to make men and women strong. It takes rough seas to make good sailors. Without overcoming obstacles, life would be flat, unprofitable, and great quality in character would be impossible.
"Who would take adversity from men? He who banishes hardship banishes hardihood, and out of the same door with calamity walks courage and fortitude, triumphant faith, and sacrificial love."
You remember "The Two Roads," by Jean Paul Richter. This is the story of a boy who dreamed that he was an old man and that he had chosen the wrong road, and he cried in the anguish of his soul for the days of his youth to returnthe days when his father took him to the fork of the roads and told him he had his choice. He explained that one road led into a dark cave where serpents hissed and crawled and where poison flowed instead of water, and the other led into sunny lands where harvests waved and birds sang. In his dream he thought he had taken the wrong road, and his heart was full of remorse. Fortunately it was only a dream. How important it is to make the right choice!
Discussion
1. How is one made strong through making decisions for oneself?
2. What factors will aid one in choosing aright?
3. Discuss the quotation: "The pursuit of easy things makes men weak, while a mastery of the difficult makes men strong."

Lesson 3The Bible Lyric
Tuesday, December 21, 1943
CHILDREN of Israel, denied through one of their commandments (Exodus 20:4) expression in the forms of painting and sculpture, gave vent to their emotions, with more than usual intensity, through lyric literature. No people have surpassed them in the creation of songs, especially those of a religious type. These Biblical lyrics are to be found mainly in the Old Testament, where they often occur in story settings or are grouped, as in the Psalms, in what we might today call a religious songbook.
How shall one distinguish a Bible lyric from the Bible story in which it is sometimes found? It would be rather difficult to do so, if one had only the King James version of the Bible. There, as has been said before, the various literary forms are all cast in a "chapter and verse" mold. But take the Modern Reader's Bible, by Dr. R. G. Moulton, or another such volume, The Bible Designed to be Read as Living Literature, by Ernest S. Bates, wherein the Bible is cast in its literary forms, and the lyrics lift into the clear.
In the study of the Bible lyric which comes in its story setting, we have a marked advantage. It is like a rose that blooms at the end of a thorny stem. Back of the song is the stirring tale that quickens into lyrical expression at the strategic moment. This is not unlike what occurs in grand opera when the story that is being dramatized rises into such a lyric gem as the "Jewel Song" in Faust, the "Sextet" in Lucia. Here is one basic difference: the Bible lyric is generally deeply religious in its cast and nature.
Let us add concreteness to these thoughts with a few typical illustrations:
Moses has broken the chains of bondage of his oppressed people. Rising in stirring climax, the epic of the Plagues has brought the story to the point when the King, feeling God's wrath in the death of his own son, has set the Israelites free. They
582
are on their way to the Promised Land. An army pursues. The waters of the Red Sea have been rolled back, and the people pass through, while the pursuers are drowned in the depths. Up to this point the story is all told in swiftly-moving Biblical prose; but even such expression cannot adequately depict the exultation that sweeps over Israel at its deliverance. It is here that a nation's heart bursts into superb song:
I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously: The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. The Lord is my strength and my song, And he is become my salvation: This is my God, and I will praise him; My father's God, and I will exalt him. The Lord is a man of war: The Lord is his name, Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: And his chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea. The deeps cover them: They went down into the depths like a stone. Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the Gods? Who is like unto thee, glorious in holiness, Fearful in praises, doing wonders?
(See Exodus 15:1-17; Modern Reader's Bible, pp. 67-68.)
The foregoing quotation is, of course, only part of this stirring lyrical ode. This excerpt, however, reveals something of a Bible song in its story setting.
Another lyric of rare artistry, David's Lament, closes the epic of the warrior king of Israel. When the tragic word of the death of Saul, the
king, and his son Jonathan, David's dearest friend, comes to him, the soul of David is expressed in these lyric lines:
Thy glory, O Israel, Is slain upon thy high places! How are the mighty Fallen!
Tell it not in Gath, Publish it not in the streets of Askelon; Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain upon you, Neither fields of offerings: For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, The shield of Saul, as of one not anointed with oil.

Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, And in their death they were not divided; They were swifter than eagles, They were stronger than lions.
Ye daughters of Israel, Weep over Saul, Who clothed you in scarlet delicately, Who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
How are the mighty Fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, Slain upon thy high places.
I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan Very pleasant hast thou been unto me: Thy love for me was wonderful, Passing the love of women.
How are the mighty Fallen! And the weapons of war Perished!
(See 2 Sam. 1:19-27; Modern Reader's Bible, pp. 281-282.)
Other well known lyrics woven into the Bible stories are the plea of Ruth, Hannah's song of rejoicing over the birth of Samuel, David's Lament over Absalom.
Besides these gems of poetry that sparkle in their various settings, there are many beautiful lyrics in the books of prophecy, especially those in Isaiah. Of these more will be said in a later lesson.
The Psalms, as already said, are a collection of the songs of Israel. Many of these echo in the hearts of people all over the world, for in their entirety or in part, they are being sung by God-fearing folk everywhere. Eminent literary critics have ranked Psalm Twenty-threeThe Shepherd Psalmas one of the finest lyrics ever created. Its lovely lines have sung solace and faith and trust into the hearts of thousands upon thousands down the years. Observe the sweet cadence and consoling thought as you read aloud these beginning lines:
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want He maketh me to lie down in green pastures, He leadeth me beside the still waters, He restoreth my soul.
Rhythmic beauty is given to the Bible lyric, as shown in this and the other parts of songs quoted in this lesson, by the parallel form in which the songs are cast. Observe that the thought of the lyric is expressed then re-expressed in different words. This is an outstanding characteristic of Hebrew verse. In effect, this repetition not only reimpresses the thought but gives to the lyric a musical beauty and, with the artistic changes in the parallel lines, avoids monotony.
Another characteristic of the Bible lyric, which marks indeed all great

lyrics, is the vividness of word pictures; for example, observe in the lines just quoted what a delightful scene is deftly sketched of a shepherd with his flock. Note also the pictures that come from these expressions, "swifter than eagles," "stronger than lions," "in scarlet delicately," "passing the love of woman."
A wealth of artistry, with an uplift into things divine, is in the study of the Bible lyric. Our hope is that this lesson may prove an "open sesame" to these treasures. It remains for those who study it to carry forward.
Discussion and Activities

ERRATUM
ATTENTION is called to an error in the social science lesson, no. 9, in the Augustpage 515, which erroneously names John Marshall as the first Chief Justice of the United States. While John Marshall was the most notable of American jurists and a Chief Justice, John Jay was the first Chief Justice.

Ezra Taft Benson Called To The Apostleship
(Continued from page 531)
Ezra T. Benson has been a consistent and devoted Church member throughout his life. His early activities centered about ward and stake priesthood work, also acting as a scout leader. He spent two years serving as a missionary in England. In 1932, while residing in Boise, he was made superintendent of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association of Boise Stake. Three years later he was chosen to be first counselor in the stake presidency, and, in 1938, he was made president of the Boise Stake in which capacity he served until he moved to Washington, D. C. with his family.
Elder Benson is blessed with a devoted wife who has supported him in all his endeavors. Flora Smith Amussen is the youngest daughter of Utah's pioneer jeweler, Carl Christian Amussen, and Barbara Smith. The Bensons are the parents of five children, Reed A., Mark A., Barbara, Beverly, and Bonnie.
President Benson will assume his new duties following the October conference at which time he will be sustained in his new position.
