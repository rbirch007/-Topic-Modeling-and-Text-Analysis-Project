To The Parents Of Service Men
Elder Hugh B. Brown Coordinator for L. D. S. Service Men
IN 1918 the Giant Mars was wounded, and some thought permanently disabled, but by 1939 he had regained his strength and in blind fury is now straining at the pillars of civilization. Never before have so many been called to resist him. Never before have so many parents, wives, brothers, sisters, and friends had a personal interest in great and unpredictable events. Modern efficiency places the most intelligent, the physically sound, the fittest of our youth, in the greatest danger.
In 1918, there were less than 20,000 Latter-day Saint men in the service. In 1943, we have more than double that number. You who have prayed with and for these men and have taught them how to pray, to read the scriptures, and to believe in God, know that they had high ideals and lofty ambition when this call came. They and you had planned their lives in peaceful pursuit of worthy achievement, and to this end you had supervised their training. This sudden changing of their course and way of life; this separation from those they love, with its accompanying loss of inspiration and the supports and safeguards of home environment; this sudden impact with a world at war, with its challenge to all they had believed and known, is subjecting that training to a test more grueling than anything you or they anticipated.
We who have observed them in this test, being transformed from boys to men, carrying tremendous responsibility and harnessed to a course of training which only the strong can endure, fearlessly preparing to meet the enemy and to look into the face of death; we who have seen their reaction to the down-drag of temptation, as well as to the uplift of high resolvewe know that you parents have reason to be proud. They were taught at your hearthstone, inspired by your example, and with pride and honor they carry the banners and standards of home and Church

to all parts of the world in numbers tenfold greater than our normal missionary corps.
Though their duty calls them far from home, and though their present discipline and training is in other hands, though they have reached maturity in a day and are strong and self-reliant and unafraid, still they want to feel that you are near them. They look to you for encouragement and faith. Being reminded that someone believes in them, is praying for them, is a real safeguard in the hour of temptation, an effective spur to high morale. They must knowand you must tell themthat they are trusted, that you have no doubt of the quality of their manhood and the integrity of their character. They will respond to the trust you place in them, will strive to be worthy of your confidence. They will spread their wings to the lifting power of your faith in them.
They hunger and thirst for word from home and anxiously watch for the arrival of the mail. If you could be present at a mail delivery in a desert camp and see their eager and expectant faces as they wait for their names to be called; if you could note, as we have done, the dejection and utter loneliness of the few to whom no mail has come, and see them crawl into their pup tents, homesick to the marrow of their bones; if you could know, as Satan knows, that at such moments their resistance is at low ebb, and that it is then he can get in some of his most effective work, you would make sure that every week would see at least one letter on its way to them.
We need not urge the mothers to write to their sons, as they are usually prompt and constant, but too often we hear young men say, "Gee, I wish Dad would write." Fathers, they need the strength which your words will bring to them. Your letter may arrive at a moment when it will save your boy from ruin.
As we waited for a train in a small town near a camp at midnight, we saw a lad sitting on the station platform. We asked him why he was alone, and where his buddies were. "They have gone for a night of revelry," he said, "and I am waiting to ride back to camp with them." When asked why he had not gone with them, he took a letter from his pocket and said, "It's from my Dad." He read one paragraph to us, which in substance was as follows: "I'm proud to have a son who can be trusted, who will meet every temptation manfully. Your mother and I believe in you." "I'd be a traitor," said the lad, "if with this letter in my pocket, I'd disgrace those who trust me like that. I'd rather die than let them down." What would have happened if that father had not written? Who would have shared the blame, if the boy had gone astray? Here, as elsewhere, there are casualties because of too little and too late.
It is a soul-searching experience to have your letters returned with a notation that your son has gone where letters cannot reach him.
A good mother, in a small town, before she bade her only son goodby, embroidered her initials on the inside of his inner coat pocket. She did not say anything about it. When the boy got to camp, he saw the letters and recognized them as his

mother's initials. That evening he wrote this sentence: "Dear Mom: I want to thank you for putting those letters inside my coat pocket. I'll try to see to it that the coat does not go any place where your name could not go." That boy is safe in the army.
THE Church is doing much to keep contact with these men. They have received tickets of identification and service men's Church directories. We are now distributing the special pocket-size edition of The Book of Mormon and Principles of the Gospel. These are sent free to all men in the service, and New Testaments are furnished by other groups. Wherever it is possible, these men are being visited by members of the Priesthood, who organize them into groups that meetings may be held wherever they may go. We get word that Church services are being held by them on various battlefronts, in Australia, Alaska, Africa, Asia, Europe, and America; but nothing which the Church may do can take the place of letters of love and encouragement from home.
But we must not write letters which have a depressing effect upon our sons. We should not emphasize the worries and despondencies which may annoy us at the time of writing. Nor should we criticize the conduct of the war or our leadership in our letters, as confidence and loyalty are basic to effective military service. Our letters should be buoyant, cheerful, full of hope. They should carry the contagion of a triumphant spirit.
Our men are now fighting to determine whether we shall have a country, homes, and churches, for

these are definitely in danger. For their sakes, we must guard our inherited forms of freedom and preserve the kind of society for which they are fighting. We must resist with all our power every attempt to introduce alien isms into our American system. But it is neither necessary nor wise to harrow up their feelings with political irritations, nor plant seeds of doubt where courage waits on faith.
Keeping contact with them during their service with the armed forces, understanding something of their problems, retaining their confidence by keeping them assured of our love, will insure their cooperation in the stupendous and delicate task which will confront all parents when the boys come home.
These 30,000 to 40,000 Latter-day Saint men will not return the same boys who went away. Some will have done a lot of sober thinking, will have discovered that in material and scientific fields old methods and the thinking which went with them did not suffice to meet the new demands. Their strong young minds will demand not only answers but reasons for those answers. They will feel the need of an assuring hand. We must be prepared to guide when the way seems dark, when heavy strain has impaired their vision; to help solve their problems, economic, educational, and spiritual; to convince them that truth is ageless and unchanging, and that there are some eternal, intangible verities.
Others will have become accustomed to acting on emotional impulses, will almost have forgotten how to think. They may not be willing to accept as true all that has authoritative sanc-

tion. An up-to-date knowledge of our changing world, an appreciation of their viewpoint will be needed, if these bewildered and soul-hungry young men returning from the battlefield are to be given bread and not a stone.
Some of them will have lost their way, will be disillusioned and discouraged. Some of them will have yielded to temptation and will need help to regain self-confidence and the courage to try again. As they come back to the reserve lines which are held by us, they must find understanding, confidence and courage, intelligence and faith. We must keep the spiritual home fires burning by which to warm them back to vigor when they come in from this awful storm.
Now is the time to begin to prepare for their coming, to take thought of the futureclear, rational, prayerful thoughtbefore it is too late. Those of them who return with physical wounds will be scientifically treated in the best institutions in the world with specialists in attendance. Everything possible will be done to restore their health, to heal their wounds, to compensate for lost abilities by establishing them in some suitable activity.
But upon the parents and the Church will rest the responsibility, not only of supplementing what the government may do, but of reestablishing their faith in life and in themselves. Spiritual hospitalization also calls for specialists who are dedicated to their tasks.
Your tasks may be difficult and your problems baffling, but when we consider the Master's promise to those who "do it unto the least of these," we may know our first duty is to guard and guide our own, if we are to hear His approving, "Well done."
Our greeting, then, includes a plea to keep in touch with our service men, to write only such letters as will buoy them up and give them hope and confidence and courage, to start today to make provision for their homecoming, and to pray for guidance as we undertake the task of postwar rehabilitation.
While they are in foreign lands, fighting to defend democracy, we will hold her banners so high at home that when they come marchingsailingflying back to a chastened but triumphant America, in gratitude to God they'll say, "Surely this was worth fighting for," and they whose sons will not come back will humbly say, "Amen."
