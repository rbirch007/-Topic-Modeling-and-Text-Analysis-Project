113th Annual Conference Elder Bryant S. Hinckley HERE is no other gathering in 'L'a world just like a general conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Laymen and leaders come from all the vast territory covered by the stakes of Zion. These conferences have a social and economic, as well as a spiritual value. The local leaders from wards and branches gather in Salt Lake City, the headquarters of the Church, for instruction, inspiration, and to transact the necessary business of the Church. They hear the annual reports, financial and otherwise, sustain with their vote the General Authorities of the Church, and go home refreshed in spirit and renewed in faith. These gatherings give solidarity to the whole body of the Church, unify and harmonize its plans and purposes, stimulate the faith of the members, and encourage the leaders to greater endeavor. Owing to the war, the attendance at the 113th annual conference was restricted to the Priesthood leaders and admission to the conference sessions was by card. The meetings were held on April 4th, sth, and 6th, in the Salt Lake Tabernacle. A new feature was the holding of regional conferences on the two Sundays following, at which representatives of the General Authorities were in attendance to carry over the spirit and message of the general conference. President Grant was present at all of the sessions of this conference except one. Yielding to the advice of his physician he did not speak, but dictated an address which was read by President David O. McKay. From the opening sentence, "To the Latterday Saints all over the world, I send my love and greetings," to the final paragraph of this inspired message, the vast audience listened with rapt attention and were thrilled by what the venerable leader had to say. Among other things, the President said, "My heart goes out in the deepest sympathy and in the most sincere and earnest prayer that I have ever offered for the comforting ifluence of the Lord to be given to the brethren and sisters who have sons in the war at the present time. I pray that Page 301 302 the Lord will bless each and every boy who has been called or who has gone into the service, and that He will help each of them to live in accordance with the principles of the Gospel, so that each may havea claim to the blessings of the Lord.... I pray that, so far as it accords with the providence of the Lord, each of them may be preserved from accident, sickness, and death, to return in due course to his loved ones. I pray God to help them to stand up under the terrible strain which they must meet. I appeal to the Lord to bring the war to an end at the earliest possible date. My heart goes out to all of you.... I want to thank the people for their prayers in my behalf. I have not been well now for a period of more than three years, and yet during all that time I have never suffered any pain. My days have been full of joy. I have seen the Church grow _.. As I have never seen it grow before.... Years ago I made a short speech that lasted a minute and a half to the effect that we were architects of our own lives, and that we and we alone are responsible for not making a success of life. What I said was as follows: 'If you want to know how to be saved, I can tell you; it is by keeping the commandments of God. No power on earth, no power beneath the earth, will ever prevent you or me or any Latter-day Saint from being saved, except ourselves. We are the architects of our own lives, not only of the lives here, but the lives to come in the eternity. We ourselves are able to perform every duty and obligation that God has required of men. No commandment was ever given to us but that God has given us the power to keep that commandment. If we fail, we, and we alone, are responsible for the failure, because God endows His servants from the President of the Church down to the humblest member, with all the ability, all the knowledge, all the power that is necessary, faithfully, diligently, and properly to discharge every duty and every obligation that rests upon them, and we, and we alone, will have to answer if we fail in this regard.' " 'These words were uttered forty years ago. They were true then and they are true now. Continuing he said, "I am grateful to our Heavenly Father for the faith and faithfulness of this great people, for their devotion to His service, for their effort and determination to live in accordance with His laws and commandments. I thank our Heavenly Father that He has given them the strength and courage to resist evils as well as they have been able to do so. I pray that He will bless the youth of the Church and give them strength to overcome temptation. I pray that He will bring into the heart of every boy, and of every girl a knowledge that cleanliness is next to godliness, that they must live clean both in mind and in body, that they will understand that the sin of unchastity is to the Lord next to the sin of murder. I pray that the Lord will give to the parents of the youth an understanding and appreciation of the dangers and temptations to which their children are subjected, that they may be led and guided to encourage their children, to direct them, to teach them how to live as the Lord would have them live. The Lord has said He would sift His people, and I pray that when that sifting 113th ANNUAL CONFERENCE comes no parent may have failed to do his duty, and no child shall have failed to obey the commandments of the Lord." RESIDENT J. Reuben Clark, Jr. Gave the concluding address of the Priesthood meeting Monday night. His manner was modest and impressive. His words clear, convincing, and authoritative, findin lodging in the minds of all who heard them. His appeal had a spiritual force and an effectiveness altogether uncommon. He pointed out the responsibility of the leaders of the Church with reference to the Latterday Saint boys in the armed service of the country. He began his remarks by asking how many had themselves served in the armed forces of the nation during the World War I then he asked who of those. Present had sons now serving in the army, and then he added those who had grandsons, and then those who had sons and grandsons subject to service in the war. Approximately half of the congregation of Priesthood officers in the Church were on their feet. This, he said, was an indication of the far reaching effects of the war. He told of the publications of literature for these service men in the form of a pocket edition of the Book of Mormon, a book on the principles of the Gospel, and a small Church Directory. "Our young men in the armed forces will need all of our faith and prayers and all that they can get from these books to help them live righteously." He referred to the commandment, "Honor thy father and thy mother" and then stressed the responsibility of Latter-day Saints to care properly 303 for their families. ""The Church," he declared, "is prepared, with your help and assistance, to take care of those who need such assistance, and if any of the Saints have cast their parents off see if you can not get them to take them back... If they need help in this let them go to the Bishops and get it in the right way.... If we assume the obligations which God has given to us, we will care for our own.... Do not be lulled to sleep by any... Slogan as that the State ' owes to every man a subsistence." President Clark gave a new definition for needy in the Church Welfare Program. He said the Church has always regarded those in need as those being without food or the necessities of life. 'Today there is a new group in need of help. This group includes any man or woman who, in this emergency, is in need of help to harvest his crops or to keep. His business going. He advocated this as a new approach for quorum activities and urged the men of the Priesthood to organize and take over this responsibility. He declared that marriage should be one of the holiest ordinances into which members of the Church can enter. He discouraged marriage by our young people with those who are not members of the Church for frequently such marriages end in tragedy. He said, "Every consideration of faith, principles of right living, Church doctrine, and Church standards, requires that we should guard, as we would guard our lives, the chastity of our girls. There are all kinds of influences at work to break down these standards. I was told the other day that we have a new phrase, that young girls who 304 smoke and drink and may be doing other things talk about "new Mormons" as distinguished from the "old Mormons." I wish to say to them that those who abandon the standards and principles of the Church are not Mormons at all," and, "I urge you young women and girls to remember that in the schedule of crimes, unchastity comes next to murder. Do not subject yourselves to its penalty." He said the members of the Church are called upon now to sacrifice their sons but because they have to sacrifice their sons is no reason why they should sacrifice their daughters. President Clark, concluded with this impressive observation: "What a tragic spectacle man is showing to his God today. We have rightly boasted for nearly a hundred years that in this, the Last Dispensation of the Fulness of Times, the Lord was pouring out His inspiration and His blessings upon all the world, unlocking to His children secrets that never were dreamed of by the ancients, giving them powers and dominions over the forces of nature, bringing under subjection almost the universe. Look at what the last century has given us in art, literature, science, discoveries, for our blessing and advancement. God gave all this to us to bless us. And then consider that now, in this terrible hour, every device, every invention, every discovery God gave us to bless us is being used to destroy one another in one of the most barbarous wars of all time. God will not hold guiltless those responsible for this holocaust." PRESIDENT David O. McKay's address was a clear and eloquent declaration of the ideals of Mormonism as they should be lived today by every Latter-day Saint. To the people of the nation and to the Latter-day Saints, President McKay voiced this vital admonition: "While our sons, sweethearts, and husbands are offering their lives in defense of the God-given gift of Free Agency and for the right to live without the domination of tyranny, let us in the 'Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as citizens of our beloved country, use our influence to see that men and women of upright character, of unimpeachable honor are elected to office, that our homes are kept unpolluted and unbroken by infidelity, that children therein will be trained to keep the commandments of the Lord, 'to be honest, true, chaste, benevolent and virtuous, and to do good to all men.'" He held the home as the second essential element in the building and perpetuity of a great people. He said, "If, and when the time comes that parents shift to the State the responsibility of rearing their children, the stability of the Nation will be undermined, and its impairment and disintegration will have begun." He scored the increasing divorce rate in the United States as a threatening menace to this nation's greatness. Race suicide and tandem polygamous relationships made possible by lax divorce laws are enemies of ideal national life. The increase throughout the United States in the percentage of divorces is alarming. And _ this insidious evil is increasing in the Church. There are too many couples in the Church, who when trouble 113th ANNUAL CONFERENCE arises, seek solution in the divorce courts. In discussing the home as the most important factor in building a great nation, President McKay declared that the most vicious enemy to home life is immorality. 'This corroding evil" he said, "is just as demoralizing to the young man as to the young woman." More than thirty discourses were delivered at the conference, every one of which was permeated with hope, encouragement, and the spirit of eternal truth. There were fervent testimonies borne and many messages of real eloquence given that will enrich the literature of the Church. The contribution which religion should make to the home, to the nation, and to society were clearly and forcefully presented. 305 The Church of the Air Address on Sunday morning, April 4th, which was a part of the general conference was given by Elder Joseph Fielding Smith, "Blessed Is the Nation Whose God Is the Lord." Although the attendance at the conference was restricted to the Priesthood leadership, its spirit and influence will reach to the remotest corner and branch of the Church. Frequent reference was made to the Church Welfare Program. The annual report showed that the Relief Society had disbursed to the needy $371,442. This large sum does not represent a tithe of the contribution of this great and benevolent society to the welfare of the people of the Church.
