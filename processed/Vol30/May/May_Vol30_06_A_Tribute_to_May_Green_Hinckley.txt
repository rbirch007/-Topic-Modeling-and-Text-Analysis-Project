A Tribute to May Green Hinckley Adele C. Howells, LaVerne W. Parmley The Counselors to Mrs. Hinckley in General Presidency of Primary MAY GREEN HINCKLEY AY Green Hinckley was born in Brampton, Derbyshire, England. She came to Utah with her mother when she was six years old. Her life has been one of faith and service. She has been active in the Church since her early girlhood. She served as a teacher in the Sunday School and in the Young Women's Mutual Improve- 'ment Association. From 1907- 1909 she served as a missionary in the Central States Mission. Upon returning home, she served as president of the Granite Stake Y. W. M. LA. For twelve years. In January of 1936, she was called with her husband, Bryant S. Hinckley, to preside over the Northern Page 312 States Mission. Soon after their release from the mission field, the First Presidency appointed her general president of the Primary Association, which position she held until her death on May 2, 1943. May Hinckley was an able executive and leader in her many and varied positions. She was a tireless worker and had unlimited energy. She knew how to work a little longer, a little harder, and a little better than most people. She had vision, understanding, good judgment, and enthusiasm. In her love and devotion for the work of the Lord she forgot self. As president of the Primary organization, the only desire of her heart has been to help the officers and teachers in the field that they might better teach the children to pray and to walk uptightly before the Lord. She served in humility and love. May Hinckley was endowed with the attributes of true success. She had a grateful heart, a thoughtful mind, a friendly smile, a kindly word, a helpful hand, and a loyal and courageous spirit. The beautiful floral tributes banked high on the stand in the Salt Lake Assembly Hall where her funeral services were held on Wednesday, May 5s, and the large attendance attested to the great love and esteem in which May' Hinckley was held. In her death, hundreds of people have lost a true friend; the Primary organization has lost a devoted leader; the Church has lost a loyal, faithful member; and the community has lost a great woman. Rachel Ridgway Ivins Grant Mary Grant Judd Member of Relief Society General Board (Part I of this two-part article appeared in the April issue.) RACHEL RIDGWAY IVINS GRANT AND HER SON HEBER This picture was taken on President Grant's ninth birthday. N a December morning of the year 1856, it was bitingly cold in Salt Lake City. Dark and sombre it appeared to Rachel Ivins Grant, a pioneer wife who lay ill with her first-born, a son, in' an oldfashioned cradle beside her. On November twenty-second, the baby had been born and his life had almost cost her own. _It was but a few days before the birth of the son, that the father, Page 313 314 Jedediah M. Grant, a vigorous man in the prime of life, had collapsed. The strain of his responsibilities and the unusual efforts he had put forth as leader in the religious movement of that time known as the Reformation, had caused his health to break. A brief and severe illness attacked him, and when the baby Heber was nine days old, Rachel's husband died. On this morming when her husband was to be buried, she lay in her room on the second floor of the comfortable adobe dwelling which had been her home during the three short years of her married life. Later she heard the funeral throngs coming and going below and wished that she might have been able to attend the services for her husband which were to be held in the Salt Lake Tabernacle; for Jedediah M. Grant had been a man of prominence in the community, being not only mayor of the City, but also second counselor to President Brigham Young. It was three o'clock in the afternoon before Rachel heard the last strains of a funeral march die away and knew that this seemingly endless day would soon come to a close. How alone she felt only those can realize who, like herself, have forsaken friends and home for an unpopular religion. With the exception of an older sister Anna, her only kin was the small bundle of humanity beside her. This baby was all that she had to live and work for. She must have thought that here was her task; to teach her son of the father he had never known, and make of him the sort of man that father would have wished his son to be. How well she accomplished her high design, there are thousands to attest today. Rachel was left with but meagre financial resources. To earn a livelihood for herself and her boy she did fine hand sewing. But this class of work brought in so little, for the longspent hours, that she found it impossible to get ahead, and as time went by, it became increasingly hard for her to live on at the Grant homestead. When Rachel's son was six years old, it was decided among the heirs of Jedediah M. Grant to sell this property on Main Street (where Z. C. M. I. Now stands), and divide the proceeds. Rachel's share was five hundred dollars with which she bought a tiny home on Second East Street just below South Temple. Here, in hard circumstances, the young Heber was given "the advantages of poverty" and learned to appreciate his mother's independence of spirit as she uncomplainingly assumed the entire financial burden of her home. Thirty years later, speaking of these hard times in a letter to her son, Rachel had this to say: "I never felt humiliated at having to work and support myself and you, and I thanked my Heavenly Father for giving me the strength and ability to do it. When talking to President Young I said if the Lord would give me health and strength, it was all I asked. And when thinking of many things I have passed through, hard and unpleasant, how happy it makes me now that I never complained, not even to my sister. I knew she would feel bad. I can talk about them now without caring." RACHEL RIDGWAY IVINS GRANT Denying themselves all but the bare necessities of life, Rachel and Heber decided that they must save for one of the wonderful new sewing machines that were newly on the market. And when it was hers, the ambitious mother, after sewing all day in some other woman's house, would often return home, prepare supper, and when she and Heber had cleared away the meal and washed and wiped the dishes, she would go at her sewing again, working far into the night. The touching picture of her little boy sitting on the floor and, with his hands, working the treadles of the machine so that her tired limbs could rest, is one that has misted the eyes of many listeners of President Heber J. Grant's sermons as he eulogized his mother. "Being Mother's -only child," he once said, "we have been very dear to each other. I doubt if a mother and son were ever any nearer for she was both father and mother to me. Her tender love bound me to her with cords of steel." Rachel's was a very hospitable nature and she did not let her limited financial resources deter herself and her son from entertaining their friends. The little home saw frequent gatherings. "Yes," she said later in speaking of those times, "they loved to come and I loved to have them. Ofttimes Heber and I would live on very scanty fare that we might have the greater pleasure of sharing with our friends. 'Sister Grant,' the boys would say, 'we have such good times here.' " N spite of her hardships, Rachel was happy in Utah, happier than she had been at an earlier date in 315 New Jersey, since physical hardships are always easier to bear than mental anxieties. So when her brother wrote from the East begging her to return and offering to settle upon her a substantial annuity for life, she declined to accept his offer; for there was a condition attachedshe must tenounce Mormonism for good and all and this she could not do. It was dearer to her than life itself. Rachel developed for herself, and taught her son, a philosophy of life that was simple and satisfying. She accepted her religion with childlike faith and left the mysteries for others to solve. She believed in the innate goodness of man springing from the actuality of God as his Father; that a Divine Providence makes and "Shapes our lives and that no matter what happens, all will come right in the end. Her motto was, "It is all for the best." Her son says of her: "So near to the Lord would she get in her prayers that they were a wonderful source of inspiration to me from childhood to manhood. When success came she was thankful; when a child was born she thanked the Lord; and when a loved one died she always felt to acknowledge the hand of the Lord." While Rachel was still a young woman and Heber a lad, she had opportunity of putting her philosophy to the test. Could she say of the fresh trial that came, "It is all for the best?" Yes, she could and did. Following a severe attack of quinsy, she commenced losing her hearing and eventually was almost totally deaf. 'This tragic handicap she patiently bore to the close of her long life. Never again could she 316 hear or join in the congregational singing which she loved. Neither could she listen to the sermons of the brethren. Heber learned to throw his voice in a sharp staccato and could make her hear him when he was across the room, but all others had to place their mouths close against her ear to be understood. But though she could not hear what was going on, Rachel still attended her meetings to partake of the sacrament and enjoy the spirit of the occasion. And, in some inexplicable way, her thoughts were directed in the same channels as those of the speakers. 'This was especially true in the regular monthly fast meetings. She was a beautiful speaker and loved to bear her testimony. Often she would arise and speak right along the same line of thought which had been developed by the others. She continued the custom in her home of having family prayers night and morning. She would take her turn, even though she could not hear her own voice, and when it became Heber's turn he would kneel beside her and pray into her ear. With characteristic optimism Rachel discovered, among the many trying features of her deafness, some phases to be grateful for. She was spared much of the noise and confusion with which others were troubled, and it was so difficult for people to make her hear that they didn't bother to relay her gossip or anything of the kind. She expressed her attitude in these words: "I grieve that I cannot hear, but while I cannot hear much of the good that is spoken, my peace is not marred by the evil that is spoken." Her son says of her: "My mother was one of the most even-tempered and best dispositioned women that I have ever known.. I have often wished that I could have such a calm, peaceful temperament as she had. I do not recall ever seeing her angry or hearing her speak an unkind word." Rachel's natural friendliness, understanding, and sympathy, offset her handicap of deafness. People loved to be in her society and she loved people. She was made president of the Thirteenth Ward Relief Society and served in this charitable organization in this capacity for over thirty years. In season and out she visited the sick, went to the house of mourning, even caring for the dead, and, in every way, relieved suffering and distress. Her son says: "Her absolute confidence in the hereafter was a great source of comfort and blessing in the hour of death to all with whom she came in contact." In early days there were no formal organizations centrally directing the several ward Relief Societies, the general board being a later development. 'There was, however, a group known as "the leading women of the church" and of this group Rachel formed a part. Here she was intimately associated with such outstanding characters as Eliza R. Snow, Bathsheba Smith, Emmeline B. Wells and others. As the widow of Jedediah M. Grant and an individual well-born in her own right, she retained the association and interest of the leaders of the Church, particularly President Brigham Young. As a boy, Heber had been playing on the floor at home when kindly RACHEL RIDGWAY IVINS GRANT Bishop Woolley, father of the Thirteenth Ward, had called upon his mother and proffered the help of the ward to fix the leaky roof of her home.: He had heard her reply: "I do not wish to be supported by the Church, I am too independent for that. 'The roof can wait until my son is older and can earn money enough to have it fixed." The young boy was greatly impressed by his mother's confidence in him. Then and there the financial aspect of life took on great importance as he resolved to repay her at the earliest possible time for her sacrifices in his behalf. This accounts for the fact that he left school at an early age and went into business for himself where he was signally successful. He lived to see the day when he was able to give his mother all the comforts of life. The religious teachings of his mother, however, and her fervent desire for him to emulate the example of his father and give his chief allegiance, not to business, but to his Church, were the determining factors in helping him to shape his life into what it has become. He learned that there are other things in life far more important than wealth. "It is a glorious thing," he says, "to be, like Nephi of old, 'born 317 of goodly parents,' it is of more worth than wealth or precious stones. No boy on earth could have had a better mother, and if I succeed in the battle of life, I will owe it all to her." Herein lay, not only Rachel's greatest joy, but a power above all unsought by her, which has perpetuated her name and made it shine out as one of the brightest among the women of the Church. When Rachel was eighty-one years old (seven years before her death), the following poem by Paul Shivell as being applicable to herself was sent her: "Thou art the chosen mother of a son, Sent to thy care from heaven, as thou wert sent, To carry on the work by Christ begun, Who came from heaven to show us what God meant. As Mary was exalted by the event Which gave us Christ, so if thou give us one To do God's will, thou, too, shall rise content Above thy days, thy cup shall. Overrun With very joyance; and the grateful tears Of happy motherhood shall lift thy soul Like some fair cloud above the sea of _ years. Thou, by thy loving precepts, shalt control Men and affairs, and thyself glorify Our noble mothers were not born to die." Happy he, With such a mother! Faith in womankind Beats with his blood, and trust in all things high Comes easy to him...Tennyson.
