interested in Relief Society work. We feel the chorus has done much to increase our attendance at Relief Society meetings and has provided a contact with the Church for several of our members. We meet twice a month during the summer and have our socials in connection with our practices.
"We feel that every ward without a mothers' chorus is missing a privilege to do missionary work."
Cache Stake (Utah)
MARY M. WEST, president of Cache Stake Relief Society, submitted the following report and accompanying picture of the stake Singing Mothers' chorus:
"The Cache Stake is justly proud of its Singing Mothers' chorus. It was one of the first to be organized and from its beginning has been very active under the able leadership of stake chorister Mae McMurrin, who has the love and support of the seventy-five or more members. It is surprising to note the progress made by these fine women. Maturity of voice and unity of spirit are largely responsible for the success of this group.
"This chorus has presented several sacred cantatas in our stake tabernacle, and has also sung beautiful hymns and anthems at our stake quarterly conferences.
"It would be impossible to estimate the amount of good this fine organization has done, not only in the homes of those who take part, but also in the inspiration and joy they have given to the community. This service is a wonderful experience for our Singing Mothers."

This group of Singing Mothers, directed by chorister Dora P. Hatch, under the sponsorship of ward president Hattie D. Foutz, furnished the music during the evening program which completed the observance of the Relief Society centennial in this ward on March 17, 1942.
This chorus has furnished the music at a baccalaureate service and has appeared on other programs in the community. The following excerpts from Sister Covington's letter give other features of the celebration of the Relief Society centennial in the Kirtland Ward, typical of similar celebrations carried out in other wards of the Young Stake:
"We began at 8 a.m. by tuning in on KSL for the inspirational talks of our beloved leaders, President Heber J. Grant and President Amy Brown Lyman.
"At 5 p.m. we witnessed an impressive tree-planting ceremony. The tree, a beautiful blue spruce, had been donated and transported to us by a florist friend from Durango, Colorado, not a member of our Church. At 8 p.m. 150 persons, consisting of Relief Society members, their partners, and ten or twelve guests not of our Church, were seated around candle-lighted tables, decorated in blue and gold. Artistic handpainted booklets entitled 'Rays of Living Light' served as place cards at each plate, which beautifully portrayed the menu, program, and appropriate scriptural quotations. One page was dedicated to our presidency, displaying a snapshot of each accompanied by a loving tribute.

"The enclosed photographs are of the Singing Mothers of our Relief Society groups in Monterrey, State of Nuevo Leon, and in San Pedro Martir, D. F. In this mission we have twenty-six Relief Society organizations and each of them has a Singing Mothers' chorus.
"The one hundredth anniversary of the organization of the Relief Society was fittingly observed by each of the organizations in the mission with 'fiestas,' 'Kermeses,' lunches, and plays. In each branch a centennial tree was planted with very impressive and appropriate ceremonies.
"The mission Relief Societies have had a very rapid growth both in number of organizations and members

enrolled during the past two years. The sisters are fast learning the relationship of the Society to the Church and they are taking their place in caring for the sick and needy. Recently in San Pedro one of the Church members died suddenly and when we arrived at her home three hours after her death, we found the sisters of the Relief Society already there, making the burial clothes and preparing the body for burial."

SETTING OF PLAY "IS IT POSSIBLE?"
Presented at the Gridley Ward Centennial Observance, Gridley Stake. Cast members: Lavern Ferrin, Eulalia Jensen, Pearl Tolley, Beulah Hepworth, Donna Brink, Eva May Gerber.
Gridley Stake (California)
THE Gridley Ward centennial observance on March 17, 1942 began at 7 p.m. when the Relief Society members were the guests of the Priesthood at a delicious supper planned, cooked, and served under the direction of the Bishopric. Relief Society colors, blue and gold, were used in the decorations. The supper was served cafeteria style from a long table centered by the birthday cake which consisted of two layers each thirty inches by fifty inches with the Relief Society emblem in the center surrounded by candles. Also decorating the table was a large bouquet of carnations, one of which was presented to each member of the Relief Society. The people ate at small tables and the supper was bountiful and delightful.
The program which followed included songs by the Singing Mothers, led by Lillian Nielson, and an address by the ward Relief Society president, Mabel Jensen, honoring past Relief Society officers, and a patriotic talk by Marvis Fife. The play, "Is It Possible?" was staged in a very beautiful garden setting under direction of Dorothy Fife, with appropriate music played softly throughout by Alice Carlin. Six young ladies in old-fashioned costumes sang and danced "Old Fashioned Garden," with Robert Fife as accompanist. The remainder of the evening was spent in dancing, and pieces of the birthday cake were served.

(Continued from page 311)
When the fourteenth candle was flaming, Amy Kathryn continued:
These are but a few of her outstanding contributions to the uplifting progress of her fellow men. And now the summation of the light that she has shed in her various fields of achievement entitles her to add a brilliancy to the Hall of Fame.
With this last statement, the little character, Amy Brown, came down the stage into the spotlight and lighted the candle representing the Hall of Fame. This candle was a large white one set in an old-fashioned candlestick made entirely of gorgeous fresh pastel-colored flowers.
In a clear steady voice filled with love, Amy Kathryn continued:
She is my grandmother and I should be modest, but she lighted my candle too, and I am grateful. Sonow dear grandmother, I return the light to you, the giver, that you may go on sharing it with others!
Amy Kathryn then gracefully picked up the huge candle in its colorful, petal-fresh holder, and carrying it the full length of the ballroom she presented it to her grandmother at the honored guests' table. This impressive finale was greeted with great applause.
Mrs. Stewart took the scroll of honor to Mrs. Lyman that she, in turn, might add her name to the list of famous women. Mrs. Shepherd welcomed her into the Hall of Fame and pinned a service medallion over her heart.
Mrs. Lyman's reply was full of appreciation for the honor accorded her. She was particularly happy that it was the women of her own community who selected her for membership in their Hall of Fame.
