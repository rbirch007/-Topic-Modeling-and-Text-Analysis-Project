Care of Children In Wartime HE General Board, aware of the many problems confronting mothers today, particularly that of safeguarding children, publishes the following letter from Katharine F. Lenroot, Chief, Children's Bureau, U. S. Department of Labor. We, along with other churches, law-enforcement agencies, and public and private welfare agencies, are greatly concerned over the alarming increase of juvenile delinquency throughout the country. We are particularly concerned because many L. D. S. Youths are among the juvenile offenders. Church auxiliary organizations have announced special programs designed to interest our children and youth and profitably direct their activities. 'The Primary Association will conduct an excellent summer program, including both work and play activities. 'The Y. W. M. LA. Plans to conduct a summer program for 20,000 BeeHive girls, directed toward effective war service work. These programs Dear Mothers and Fathers: merit the full support of mothers or the Church. However, the task of properly caring for and directing children cannot be left to Church auxiliaries; it devolves primarily upon parents. 'The General Board urges mothers throughout the Church to place every possible safeguard about their children. An evil influence is abroad which threatens even the best homes. Social problems, greatly aggravated by the war, demand vigilance on the part of mothers. There is no substitute for mothers in the home, and they should not leave the home to earn money unless real necessity demands it and unless proper provision is made for children while the mother is away. Parents should also make sure that both boys and girls who leave home to take employment are satisfactorily located in homes with interested relatives or other responsible adults, where they may be properly supervised. May 1, 1943 Have you been wondering whether you are doing everything you can for your children during this war period?... If ever children needed mothering and fathering, they need it now.... Your Johnny and Jane know lots of things are different at home today. There will be more changes tomorrow. Both for you and for them many of these changes are hard to take. But with you there, throwing your confidence and pluck and affection around Johnny and Jane, they'll not be hurt. These are the foods your children grow on, just as much as the bread they eat. They need such food every A child's spirit can be undernourished as well as his body. Day of their growing lives. Your faith, and your courage, and your love are Grade A foods for your child's spirit. There are no others as good. Of course it takes time to give children that quality of care. Just as you willingly give the time it taks to provide the carrots, milk, and other Page 332 CHILDREN IN WARTIME 333 foods you give your child, you'll be glad later for the extra time you spend now in giving him affectionate guidance. Behind many a youngster in trouble is a parent overburdened with work, who thought he or she was too busy for children. Because the job you are doing is so tremendously vital to the Nation, a Children's Bureau Commission on Children in Wartime is helping our Bureau to help you in every way we can. Millions of you parents, during war, will have no choice but to yield to someone else some part of the place you have in your children's lives. Some fathers must go to war. Some mothers must leave home to work. To those of you who must, the doctors say: Keep the channels of affection and the lines of communication to your children as wide open as you can. If Dad must be away from home altogether, try to put your children in touch with some other male relative who will keep an affectionate eye on your charges. Group activities, directed by men in the neighborhood or in school or church, will help your young ones without changing their loyalty and affection for their fathers. And when Dad leaves be sure that, if possible, the letters keep coming back home. Fathers who are at home can help mightily, too, if they will take time to spread their companionship to neighbors' children who must wait until war is over to welcome home their own fathers. And you, Mother. If you are one of the millions of mothers who do your war job of caring for your children at home, maybe you can give some of yourself to the children of other mothers, too. Perhaps you can help at the baby clinic, or with school lunches, or on playgrounds.... If you are a mother who must earn money away from home, get the best possible substitutes you can for the care you would otherwise provide. If you can't find or can't afford someone to come into your home, use every help your community provides for children. If you don't know what they are, yout local defense council will be glad to give you suggestions. Last but not least, especially watch over your older boys and girls, who are having to grow up so fast. 'They may need to be guarded against overtaxing their strength. They may want your aid in finding ways of helping that will make them feel important in your grownup world. Above all, they deserve the kind of advice that understanding friends give to each other. You see how big a job you fathers and mothers have in your hands right now. It's a war job of the highest priority rating. There are no uniforms to wear to distinguish this public service. No medals will come to you if you do well. But the bearing and grace of your child as he lives his days bravely and with fine spirit will be the match of any medal. Sincerely yours, Katharine F.
