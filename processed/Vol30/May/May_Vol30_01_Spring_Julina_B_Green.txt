SPRING Julina B. Green The throaty song of the meadow lark, The blackbird's trill in the rush, The purple violet hiding low In the damp of the grasses lush, Sends a throbbing thrill intense as pain To my heart, and memories bring Of days long dead; but their spirits sweet Linger yet in the breath of spring. The saucy gray chipmunk chattering, The trout in the mountain brook, The pussy willow soft and shy In a shadowy, sheltered nook, With a magic spell my youth restores And I long 'mong the hills to roam As once in that sweet lost long ago Where rocks teased the water to foam. The bees abuzz in the lazy warmth On the sunny side of a bank, The musty smell of the rotting leaves At the roots of new grasses rank, Fan embers of fires that burned long ago And struck a responsive string On the harp of my heart, asleep so long, With recurrence of lovely spring.
