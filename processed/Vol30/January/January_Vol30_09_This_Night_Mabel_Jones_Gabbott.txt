THIS NIGHT Linnie Fisher Robinson - We toiled, beloved, to build a universe secure, Hoping for lasting peace, where we could turn To things of home; nor dreamed our sons should thus endure Days like those other ones we knew. But hate fires burn, Raging across the world; dreams fall apart Leaving but blackened ruins smoldering behind, Bringing despair to try the human heart And tear security from out the human mind. Yet counting all the sands our lives have known, Adding our joy when peace lay on the land, We can but say that life is good; we can but own That, through those storms, we knew that God was in command. Today, that candle, in this dark, shines bright For things our sons shall gather past the night!  Psychological WarfareAn Invisible Weapon Mark K. Allen Psychologist, Utah State Training School WAR is fought today from three principal approaches: the economic, the military, and the psychological. Economic warfare means "starvation for our enemies and food for our friends." It means keeping the enemy from obtaining from anywhere in the world the things he needs to live and to make war on usthe food, the iron, the fuel, and the other materials needed to make and operate a war machine. In an age of mechanization, this type of warfare is very important. In this type of warfare the economicthe Allies had the better of the argument in World War 1. But in this war, the Axis has already reduced through conquest this economic inequality. In the military phase of war, until recently, the Axis seems to have had a definite advantage, because of longer preparation, more thorough training, and a more definite military plan than was the case with the United Nations. Our present mobilization and arms production program, as well as mass air attacks on Axis war industries, are calculated to remove this advantage. The third type of warfarethe psychologicalmeans weakening the opponent through all sorts of tricks designed to confuse, to frighten, to discourage, to mislead, and to divide. It is "an offensive war waged with intellectual and emotional weapons to destroy the power of morale resistance in the enemy's army and civilian population and to diminish enemy prestige in the eyes of the neutrals." An Axis spokesman has said, speaking of psychological warfare, that "It is essential to attack the enemy nation in its weak spots, to undermine and break down its resistance, and to convince it that it is being deceived, misled, and. Brought to destruction by its own government. 'Thus the people will lose confidence in the justice of its cause so that the political opposition in those nations will raise its head and become a more powerful trouble-maker. The enemy nation's originally solid, powerful, and well-knit fabric must be gradually disintegrated, broken down, rotted, so that it falls apart like a fungus treaded upon in a forest." Psychological warfare consists of spreading rumors, false reports, threats, and fears of deadly secret weapons. The channels through which this type of warfare is prosecuted are short-wave radio, fifth column, and rumors planted by agents of the opponents and spread by people uncritically. The type of material spread usually has to do with the strength of the aggressor, the weakness of the defender, and the futility of resistance. An attempt is made to discredit the leaders of the opposing nations. In early stages of psychological warfare, a feeling of Page 23 easy complacency is encouraged by promises of non-aggression. Psychological warfare is referred to today by news commentators as the "war of nerves," the "strategy of terror," "breaking down the home front," "demoralizing the enemy," and the "war of words," or propaganda. With the stepping up of communications, especially the radio, psychological warfare has taken on a new significance in the present war. There is nothing incomprehensible in this type of warfare, and every American should thoroughly understand it and realize how treacherously it can attack, even over many thousands of miles of land and sea. Let us, then, turn to the problem of psychological warfare as practiced against the Democracies, Freedom of ptess, of speech, and of assembly all censored or denied in totalitarian countries as a step in the psychological preparation of their own peoplein democratic countries provide fertile soil in which to wage psychological warfare. The Axis program has three principal aims: (1) to increase conflict and disunity among us; (2) to produce anxiety, fear, and confusion; and (3) to produce apathy and disillusionment. Just as the Axis strategy on the battlefield is to divide and then to conquer, so on the psychological front every possible device is employed to promote disunity among us. The starting points are our own latent prejudices. A few of the most common possibilities are racial, religious, political, national, and economic class prejudices. The efforts of the enemies of this country to stir up racial hatreds are well known, and the nearer their claims fit our prejudices, the more they stir up strife and disunity among us. Religious prejudices are easily aroused by propaganda, and political disunity is readily promoted. Repeated attempts have been made to drive wedges between the United States and Great Britain by saying that "Britain always gets someone else to pull her chestnuts out of the fire." Likewise, Japan points out to China the futility of expecting continued help from allies who have so miserably "let her down in the past." Short-wave radio propaganda from nations at war with us has been particularly directed toward stirring up economic class hatred in America. One of the corner stones of this plan of conquest is the hope that America will collapse from within because of the failure to achieve class unity. Labor is stirred up against capital, and capital against labor. Unfortunately, many people in this country are caught in this trap because of already established prejudices along this line of thinking, which, of course, invites propaganda of this character from the enemies of this country. The second general aim of psychological warfare, after divisions are fostered among the people, is to produce anxiety, fear, and confusion. This is done through pointing out to the victim the invincibility of the aggressor. It consists of a strong military power intimidating a weaker one into submission. The weak are told of the fate of other victims, and are warned of a worse fate, and impressed with the futility of resistance. This "strategy of terror' has been one of the cruelest weapons of the aggressors. If weak peoples still resisted after due warning, their fate  PSYCOLOGICAL WARFARE was as bad as promised and became a warning to the next victim. Terror is spread by several devices. Civilian bombing is perhaps the most dreadful. Bombs are even made to scream to add to the terror. Incendiaries and delayed-action bombs prolong and intensify the terror of mass raids. The threat of gas bombs has also been used to advantage. Fear has been spread by such tricks as throwing images on the clouds with huge lantern-slide projectors. _ Little does a warring nation care whether its opponents are destroyed by bombs and shells or by psychological methods so long as they cease resistance. Panic and a broken will to resist through actual combat or war work is the aim of the "strategy of terror." If psychological victories can be won, they are usually much less costly than actual military conquests. It is difficult to estimate how much aggressor armies and machines have been spared by psychological victories of the propaganda bureaus. Confusion is spread by circulating all sorts of false news reports. Reports from an opposing nation may say an attack will be made at a certain time at a certain place. Then the place will be changed. When sufficient confusion has been caused, an attack will be made at a wholly unexpected place. Confusion makes organized resistance more difficult. False reports have been circulated repeatedly in this war by nations whose armies were locked in close combat with those of other nations, often successfully dispersing and disorganizing the opposing forces. The third aim of psychological warfare is to promote apathy and disillusionment. The Axis nations have 25 been known to spread much propaganda about some great action, such as the move through the Balkans, then the talk would subside, then it would start up again and die down again. Finally, when everyone had become apathetic about it, they would strike. Japan talked of arbitrating her difficulties with United States up until the very day the attack was made on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese have repeatedly tried to disillusion the people of the United States about the reliability of the reports given them from the Navy as to losses. Japan's technique is to announcesometimes accurately, but often notUnited States' naval losses several days in advance of the Navy's reports. In the battle of Java, 'in which United States losses were severe, Japan announced them with some accuracy many days before our reportthe aim being to make it appear to the people of this country that Japan forced the Navy to make admissions it otherwise would not have made. People should constantly be on guard against this trick, remembering how important it. Is for our Navy to avoid giving information to opposing nations. Another plan is to announce several days in advance the capture of a certain city which is quite sure to be taken later. This forces a denial from the defenders at first, but an admission later when the city is actually takenall of which, it is hoped, will establish confidence in the reliability of reports from the opposing nations and a distrust of reports of one's own nation. Another trick of similar character, practiced by the Axis, is the announcement of false victories for the Democracies. Since we are watchful for good news, we may accept these reports, not suspecting their origin. Later, when reports prove untrue, we become disillusioned and confused. The secretive way in which the Axis powers plan campaigns often lulls us into a sense of false security. Our perilous plight of unpreparedness during the early months of this war was our punishment for years of this weakness. Nations at war with the United States have taken great advantage of our easy optimism and uncritical self-sufficiency. We have failed to take a proper measure of those who are against us, and we have considerably overestimated the security we have in extensive but undeveloped material resources and manpower. Nations opposing this country still feign weakness at times to lull us into this sense of false security and the resulting relaxation of effort. Another potent psychological weapon is the peace offensive. Should the United Nations appear to be really about to win the war, a strong bid for peace can surely be expected from the Axis. The hope will be to lull the Democracies back into a sense of false security, while further preparation may be made to attack them. The Axis nations real- 2 ize how "pacifistic" at heart we are, and they are sure to attempt to turn this fine ideal to our destruction. The defense against psychological warfare is as complicated as war itself. Let us hope that some understanding of what it is will aid in our resistance to it. However, civilians can prepare themselves against it in some measure by abiding by the following suggestions: First, keep reliably informed on the daily news. Learn to check habitually the sources of all reports and to evaluate their content according to their source. Second, don't carry rumors. They are the most unreliable source of news there is. Remember, most of them are planted by those opposed to us, and they are meant to confuse and mislead us. Always ask the tumor monger where he got his story. Write it down if it sounds vicious enough, then check it with your civilian defense authorities. You might thus help to find fifth columnists. Don't repeat rumors to your neighbots. Third, speak constructively of democracy and its leaders. This doesn't mean not to criticize, but it does mean to learn to see and to speak of all that is good as well as that which needs correcting. FAITH AND COURAGE The following Christmas message by Nicholas Murray Butler may appropriately be carried into the new year: Christmas Day in this year of grace will be celebrated with civilization at the lowest mark in the history of modern times. This means that more than ever men of light and leading and insight must have faith and courage and hope. They must not and cannot let their faith weaken in those everlasting ideals which must rule any civilized and peaceful world....
