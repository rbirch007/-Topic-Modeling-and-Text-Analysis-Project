Brigham Young University in Provo. She was a beautiful girl, and while quite young she married Joseph Lyman Robison, a member of another pioneering family, and a man of fine character. At first the pair lived in southern Utah, then they made a lovely home for their growing family in Provo. Later, they moved to Salt Lake City. 'Fhey had four daughters and two sons. The girls married and devoted themselves to their homes. The oldest son, Harold, is a prominent physician in Los Angeles, while Rulon, a singer, teaches at the famous New England Conservatory of Music. MISTER ROBISON worked fist in the Mutual Improvement Association, then on the Granite Stake Relief Society Board, where she became counselor to the president. Brother Robison cooperated and encouraged his wife to do the Church work for which she was in demand. During World War I, Louise Robison became a Red Cross instructor and supervisor in the surgical dressings department. For outstanding services, she was honored with the emblem of the Red Cross, a beautiful pin. In 1921, President Heber J. Grant called Sister Robison to be second counselor to Sister Clarissa S. Williams, the new general president of Relief Society. Sitting in the audience when her name was presented, she was almost overcome with surprise. Because of her sympathetic nature and her exquisite needlework, Sister Robison was made chairman of the important burial-clothes department of the General Board. Able to express condolence in a delicate, tactful maner, she was a genuine comfort to the bereaved. Sister Robison took a special interest in home beautification, and through her enthusiasm and under the Society's direction trees and shrubs were planted and homes were improved. In view of Sister Robison's interest in furthering human welfare and happiness, she was chosen to represent the Relief Society at two conferences of the Travelers Aid Society and at three National Conventions of Social Workers, appearing on the program at one of them. Her reports of her attendance at 'the White House Conferences for Children breathe love and sympathy and a longing for improved conditions for the nation's young. In 1928, Sister Robison was appointed general president of Relief Society. She has traveled widely in the stakes and missions of America and in the missions of Europe, carrying messages of gladness, stirring people's hearts, arousing love and enthusiasm for the Gospel and its work. Her grace of manner, natural eloquence, kindliness, her remarkable memory for names and faces, her personal interest in Relief Society workersall have made her a most welcome visitor. At a World Congress of Women in Chicago, while the World's Fair was open, the president of the National Council of Women, Lena M. Phillips, appointed Mrs. Robison to preside at one session, which was attended by hundreds of women from all over the world. When a delegate to the International Council of Women in Paris, France, Mrs. Robison by request represented Lena M. Phillips at two meetings of the international presidents. Only the properly accredited women were admitted. While in Europe, Sister Robison visited Relief Societies in some of the branches in England, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, and Germany. Many of the Saints still hold her visit in precious remembrance. Sister Robison sponsored institutes in social welfare to teach Relief Society women better methods of caring for the poor. During Sister Robison's presidency a notable event occurred. A monument was erected by the Relief Society at Nauvoo, Illinois, to mark the site where Relief Society was organized March 27, 1842. This monument is of stone, four by eight feet, surmounted by two bronze tablets giving historical data of Relief Society. At the dedication ceremony, July 26, 1933, hundreds of people sat under spreading locusts, or stood nearby. Mr. W. D. Chenery of Illinois wrote in a newspaper there that "Mrs. Louise Y. Robison, presided over the ceremonial with a graciousness and tact that might be the emulation 74 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINEJANUARY 1943 LESSON DEPARTMENT of chairmen the world over." Another writer commented that her pleasing manner and ready wit caught the crowd, Another important project encouraged by Sister Robison, and one which became a very popular phase of Relief Society work in America and in the foreign missions, was the development of Singing Mothers' choruses. Sister Robison has done much temple work during her lifea work that has been for years one of her major satisfactions. 'The spiritual side of the-Gospel appeals to her nature. Late in 1939, when the General Boards of Relief Society and Primary 715 were reorganized, Sister Robison and her Board were honorably released. She was then asked to be an ordinance worker in the Salt Lake Temple, and took much pleasure in fulfilling that call. She is at present actively engaged in Relief Society work in San: Francisco Stake. She accepts many invitations to speak in wards and stakes. Sister Robison and her Board inaugurated the fouryear Relief Society membership campaign and carried it forward for two years. Her interest in this project continued throughout the campaign. The true spirit of the Gospel emerges in her voice and shines forth in her countenance.

Let me see your report card, Judith," he said. She gave it to him. "Why, there's a mistake here. How is that?" He used an eraser and a pen and handed the card back. A "G" was written where the "P" had been. "Oh, thanks!" Judith gulped and ran to her seat. Mr. Peterson looked hard at a book. Edna turned abruptly and walked out of the room, her back a rigid exclamation point of triumph and disgust. Judith caught a glimpse of her face as she turned to close the door. It was grey-white like snow in shadow. The group in the rear broke up, and Judith moved outside, too. No one wanted to talk. Afterwards the schoolroom was different. Mr. Peterson's attitude was impersonal, and a whole new world opened wide. There was so much to learn and so little time! Life grew exciting and happy again. Soon the feeling of expectancy, which was spring, rose on the air; and the hillside, still clothed in the shaggy grass of the autumn before, began to push through the snow. When the windows were open, Judith could hear the first water-song coming up from the sunny side of the bridge where the creek was creeping out of its cold, hard covering and bubbling over with freedom. The linnets alighted in the nearby trees and tossed up their tinkling notes: "Happy greeting! Happy greeting!" And there was a fresh, clean smell in the air as of rainwashed leaves or newly-laundered curtains. Then, suddenly, it was May; the Maypole dance was over, the pasture rolling down toward the creek from the schoolyard fence was warm and green and dotted with brassy little buttons of dandelions, and the final examinations were just around the corner. Now Judith sat on the summer grass remembering Edna Silver... Justice is a group affair, justice for: everybody, and everybody's concern.... Some folks unkind, but more who were selfless and lovable and great... Edna Silver. All these were hers in a wonderful country; and she had thought it was a new dress that mattered, but Edna had known. Her heart was packed to bursting with unformed dreams. This Night Mabel Jones Gabbott How beautiful this twilight hour! The day Is done. In roseate blue and gold and pink Apollo's fiery chargers seem to sink Beyond our small world's rim and speed away. Then softly, silently night closes in, The stilled sweet hush of ending day is near; Warm lights in little windows now appear, Dispelling shadows, 'circling joy within. And yet beyond the tinted line of sky And earth, beyond the sunset's afterglow, Great war clouds gather, flinging wild and high, Their dark and somber silhouettes of woe. Our dusk falls peacefully and calm this night; God grant our sunrise may be clear and bright. 76 RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINEJANUARY 1943 DEAFENED Otarion Vacuum Tube Hearing Aid is Light weight, Small size, Dependable Economical @AMA accepted Noiseless Inconspicuous Guaranteed Rent an Otarion at low cost-- applied to purchase price.
