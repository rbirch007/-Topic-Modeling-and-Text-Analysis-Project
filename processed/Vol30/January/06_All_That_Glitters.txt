All That Glitters Norma Wrathall First Prize Annual Relief Society Short Story Contest
"WANTED: At once. Women between ages 18 and 40 to work in war plant cafeteria. Wages, $80 per month. Transportation and one meal furnished. Apply at..." The newspaper slid from Emily Merrill's hand: "Wanted... $80 per month...." Her eyes sought out the worn linoleum, the scuffed chairs, the kitchen curtains, which in spite of frequent laundering refused to stay crisp. She looked down at her thin red hands, idle for once in her lap. How long had it been since she had had money to buy anything she really wanted? Somehow it had taken all they could scrape from the farm to meet expenses and make payments on the mortgage. She sighed. Of course, Jack was working at the plant himself, but he said that every cent they didn't have to use on absolute necessities must go on the debt, now was his chance to "get out from under" as he put it. Well, all the more reason she should earn a little. She folded the ad page and put it carefully in the cupboard drawer. Why it was wonderful, that's what it was; it was her golden opportunity. She hummed a tune as she prepared the evening meal. By the time the family was assembled around the supper table, a definite plan had taken form in her mind, but she waited until Jack had finished eating before she said anything. "Never try to convince a man whose stomach is empty," her grand-
NORMA WRATHALL
mother had always said. Besides, Jack always read the paper at the meal table. At last he finished his dessert and put down the paper. Emily drew a deep breath, pushed her hair back of her ears, and began. "I don't like it," Jack pronounced emphatically, as she paused for another breath. "I don't want my wife running around in any workman's cafeteria, waiting on a lot of foreigners and...." Emily was prepared for opposition, but before she could say anything more, sixteen-year-old Etta inter-

rupted: "Don't be so old-fashioned, Dad. All the women are working nowadays. A woman's place isn't just in the home any more, you know." He drew his brows together at her condescending tone. This red-headed daughter of his certainly needed her come-uppance for a change. Emily rose hastily to pour oil on the troubled waters. How alike they were, ready to flare at the drop of a match, her sandy-haired husband with his threatening brows, and the girl with her head on one side, staring back at him from under impudently lowered eyelids. "Of course, Etta, a mother's first duty is to her family," Emily said quietly, "but I'm sure I can manage home and job too, right now; the twins are getting older, and you can help with the housework." She was a quiet-mannered woman, with dark hair and soft brown eyes which belied the inner strength her husband had been heard to call stubbornness. By the time she had finished packing his lunch box, with Etta safely out of the way on an errand at the drug store, she had won his consent to her plan. The children were in school all day, and by carefully planning her work, she thought she could manage it. She would arrange for the nine-year-old twins, Billy and Betty, to stay after school with Great-aunt Bessie, a childless widow who had always been fond of them. And Etta could take care of herself, and do a good share of the housework. Emily's agile mind swept on to the systematic planning of her day's work: the breakfast to be cooked early, and served to the children later by Etta; the lunches for the entire
family to be prepared the night before; a hot, cooked dinner in the evening after she came home from work. She could do the washing and ironing and clean the house on her day off. Really, it all seemed so simple. Even Aunt Bessie's lack of enthusiasm failed to dampen her spirits. "It would be different if you had to work, Emily," Aunt Bessie said. "If that were the case, I'd move right in and help you, if necessary. But I should think that with Jack working.... Well," she sighed, "all I hope is that I don't have one of my headaches on the days the children are here." She shook her head dolefully and went on, as Emily thought, "making mountains from molehills."
EMILY would never forget the day she brought home her first pay check. She sat down and kicked off her shoes to ease her burning feet while she tore open the envelope. Let's seenew linoleum should be the first thing to buy, and some crisp new curtains. And she did want to make a down payment on bed divan for the living room. That old couch was such an eyesore. Her pleasant reverie was broken as the screen door banged, and the twins came bouncing into the room. "Hi there, mom," cried Billy, "Isn't supper ready yet? Gee whiz, am I starved!" Billy was always hungry. He grabbed a piece of baker's bread from the box and stuffed it into his mouth. "Not so much slang, dear. Yes, I'll have it ready in a few minutes." Little needles shot up the backs of her legs as she bent her energy to the task. Goodness, it was getting late. "Say, mom," called Betty from the bathroom, where she was washing her hands, "Aunt Bessie said to tell
ALL THAT GLITTERS
you, of course we're welcome to stay there, but Billy'd have to do better. Know what he did?" She pointed an accusing soapy finger. "He put two toads in Aunt Bessie's goldfish bowlright in with the fish. 'Magine!" Betty set her lips self-righteously. "Yah, an' what if I did, ole Miss Smarty! And mom, know what she did?" Billy's voice was loud with scorn. "Kept coming in the house with her roller-skates onright on the linoleum Aunt Bessie'd just waxed. She said...." "Oh, children, stop it. Mother's too tired tonight. And Billy, get the broom and sweep up all that mud you dragged in. Betty, help mother set the table. And put away your school things. Oh, dear, Etta's not home from school yet, and it's nearly six." Her voice rose in strident irritation. She found herself wondering, a little grimly, if Aunt Bessie still could be heard to wish piously that the Almighty had seen fit to bless her with a family. They were half way through supper by the time Etta came in, tossing her sweater over a chair. Emily looked fondly at her daughter whose red-gold hair framed a piquant face with dancing brown eyes. Etta went at once to the kitchen mirror and began a careful inspection of her complexion. "Where've you been, Etta?" asked her father, abruptly emerging from his newspaper. "Over to Meryl's," answered Etta, patting her curls. "I ate supper over there." "You're supposed to be home when your mother comes. You should help out a little. And who is Meryl?" "We were practicing a song and
19
dance act for assembly. Meryl's so talented." She turned around, executing a dance step. "Meryl Sisom. You know, Mother." "Some new people who just moved into town. They live over in the old Jacobs' home," explained Emily. Jack grunted. "Humph. Well, you see that you bring Meryl or whoever she is over here to practice so you can help a little. And that's final!" He brought his fist down on the table with a bang. "Oh, all right," Etta pouted. "Mr. Sisom makes simply scads of money," she went on, with a side glance at her father. "Meryl has awfully smart clothes. She's getting a new chubby fur jacket. Wish I could," she sighed volubly. Jack paddled off to the living room in his stocking feet to finish his nap, muttering that the money some people were spending was ridiculous, and Emily began clearing the table. "Maybe we can manage the jacket later on," she said to Etta who was helping. "Now hurry, dear, you'll be late for Mutual. It's Tuesday night, you know." "Oh, I'm not going tonight," replied Etta, "Meryl doesn't want to join. She says the things they do at Mutual are childish."
AS the weeks hurried on and the tag ends of work from even Emily's careful planning began to pile up, she tried to grow accustomed to the lint which accumulated under the beds from her one "free day" a week to the next. She trained herself not to notice the pile of mending which grew steadily higher on the sewing machine, or the ironing which hung perennially on the clothes' rack. But by the time the short cold days of winter had set in, she began to worry about Betty's frequent colds. Emily knew that Aunt Bessie, really the soul of kindness, nevertheless must have her house neat, and that often the twins played out-of-doors late on chilly afternoons with sweaters unbuttoned and caps left carelessly in the house. She tried to console herself with the knowledge that, as she always worked day shift, she was at home evenings to see that the children went to bed on time, with colds doctored if necessary. Somehow, she had ceased to talk over family troubles with her husband. By the time she had finished her almost endless evening tasks, he was usually asleep in his chair; or, if he was working night shift, he had to leave for work soon after she came home. And, like herself, he seemed too tired for much conversation. The few words they had for each other were merely moments snatched from seemingly more essential things. She would have liked to talk to him about the sealed note addressed to her which fell from Bill's overall pocket one night as she was hanging up the children's clothes. "Mrs. Merrill," it began, "if possible, will you please see that Billy gets some extra drill on his 'times tables' each evening? Otherwise, I may have to put him in a slower group. Your cooperation will be greatly..." and signed with the teacher's name. A guilty flush spread over Emily's face. The afternoons and evenings of over half the season had slipped away, and Billy had gone joyfully on, his "times tables" cards, sent home earlier in the year, reposing in the cupboard drawer. It was only a few days later that the foreman, Mr. Walters, told Emily that she would have to work night shift for several weeks; he was short of experienced women for the night work. "It will mean that you'll have to see to getting the twins to bed," she told Etta, as they prepared supper. "Your father is on the afternoon shift, and I have to leave right after supper." Etta didn't reply at first, but went on setting the table. "I've a chance to work evenings and Saturdays down at El Dansante Cafe, waiting on tables," she began at last. "Oh, but Etta," Emily's voice lifted in quick concern. "I don't want you to work down there. It'll be too hard on you. Anyway, I need you here at home." She forced her lips to smile. Etta glanced curiously at her mother; and the older woman realized, with a pang, that her daughter suddenly seemed grown-up, an adult who faced her with alien eyes. "But Mother," replied Etta, "you don't stay home. Why should I?" In the end, Etta won her parents' grudging consent to take the job; the hours wouldn't be long, and the proprietor promised to see that the girls got home safely. Emily prevailed upon Aunt Bessie to keep the twins at night, and for a while everything seemed to go smoothly again. Emily couldn't remember, later, just when she first began to notice a change in Etta. It may have been the morning Jack told her that their daughter was staying at El Dansante to dance long after her work was finished. "I've spoken to her about it. But I'm to go on night shift myself, now, so you'd better remind her to get home early," he warned Emily. One afternoon, she was roused by

ALL THAT GLITTERS
the sound of Etta's and Meryl's voices in the kitchen. She glanced at the clock. Only two-thirty; they should still be in school. She frowned as she slid her feet into slippers and pulled her robe around her shoulders. It was hard enough to get a little rest, what with the essential housework lasting most of the forenoon. "How is it you two aren't in class?" she asked, opening the kitchen door. "Oh, we... That is, I... Got a call to go to work a little earlier," answered Etta lamely. "But Etta, you shouldn't miss school for any other work." Emily tried to keep the panic out of her voice. She realized, without knowing why, that this had happened before. "Oh, Mother, don't be silly." Etta's young face flushed with embarrassment. She glanced at her friend, who was watching with a little amused smile. "Well, let's not have it happen again." Emily turned back to the bedroom, suddenly conscious of her tousled hair and crumpled robe under Meryl's cool appraising eyes. Funny she'd never noticed before what a bold look the girl had, with frankly darkened lashes and too bright lipstick. It was later that same afternoon that she found Meryl's compact on the kitchen table. Only, as it sprang open in her hand, it contained not rouge and powder, but cigarettes. Etta, questioned about the matter, replied sulkily that she didn't know if Meryl smoked; it wasn't any of her business anyway, was it? The incident was crowded back in Emily's mind by the endless tide of work that pushed her on.
21
Then one Friday morning Emily was searching for her coat, getting ready to go home. She hummed a tune, thinking of what Mr. Walters, the foreman, had said as she left her work. "It's time for you to change back to day shift again Sunday, Mrs. Merrill. You've done so well, I want you to supervise the women workers. Only thing, you may be 'frozen' to your job for the duration, and you'll have to take your turn at the night shift. But it'll mean an increase in pay. Let me know when you come back Sunday." Preoccupied, she was at first unaware of what the women on the other side of the rack were saying. "...Well, if Etta were my daughter, I'd never let her run around with that Meryl Sisom." "...Humph. I guess she's just as bad as the rest. Out all hours of the night. The whole crowd smoking and drinking, so I hear." The door banged after the women. Emily stood clutching her coat, their words still ringing in her ears. Of course, it wasn't true! It couldn't be. Not Etta. Then she remembered the cigarette case. The ride home in the crowded bus seemed endless. She found Jack in the kitchen, gloomily cooking his breakfast. Emily sat down by the table and pushed back the stale dishes from last night's supper. If only she could stop shaking while she told him. He said nothing at first, and Emily thought that, oddly, he didn't seem surprised. "Well, Emily," he said gravely at last, "I don't know as I blame you for trying to earn a little extra. Heaven knows you deserve it, after all your years of going without. But this old 'home ship' of ours needs a pilot at the helm. Go into the living room." "Go into... But what...?" "Just go on in. You'll see." He pushed back his chair and followed her. For the rest of her life Emily would remember the scenethe early light mottling the rug, the fur jacket flung carelessly on a chair, and on the new divan, the girl lying asleep, still fully clothed, her bright hair spilling over the dark cushions. Emily opened her mouth, but no words came. Her feet were like lead as she walked across the room and bent down. She hadn't known how her knees were trembling until they gave way and she sank down on the edge of the divan. "Oh, Jack, Jack!" she sobbed, "she isn't... That is, I thought...." "No, she isn't drunk," said Jack bluntly, "just given out from dancing at that fool place where she works. [ put-my coat over her when I came in from work. Now, don't cry, Emily, she's all right  so far, at least." He put his arm around her shoulders, and in an instant the aloofness of the past months vanished in their common bond of concern. Then the rough gentleness in his voice gave way to sudden anger. "But I won't have it. This is the end. No daughter of mine...." Etta sat up, rubbing her eyes. "Gee, what's the matter? Say, I didn't intend to stay here all night." "All night!" Her father's voice exploded like a storm. "Don't worry, daughter. You haven't been here all night! Now just you listen to me." His angry words beat upon Etta's bowed head. But Emily, still dabbing at her eyes with her wadded handkerchief, had made up her mind at last. She had gone to the hall phone and dialed a number. "Hello, is this... Oh, all right. Just give Mr. Walters a message for me, please. Tell him that Mrs. Emily Merrill will not be at work... Any more." > BEYOND THIS NIGHT Linnie Fisher Robinson - We toiled, beloved, to build a universe secure, Hoping for lasting peace, where we could turn To things of home; nor dreamed our sons should thus endure Days like those other ones we knew. But hate fires burn, Raging across the world; dreams fall apart Leaving but blackened ruins smoldering behind, Bringing despair to try the human heart And tear security from out the human mind. Yet counting all the sands our lives have known, Adding our joy when peace lay on the land, We can but say that life is good; we can but own That, through those storms, we knew that God was in command. Today, that candle, in this dark, shines bright For things our sons shall gather past the night!  Psychological WarfareAn Invisible Weapon Mark K. Allen Psychologist, Utah State Training School WAR is fought today from three principal approaches: the economic, the military, and the psychological. Economic warfare means "starvation for our enemies and food for our friends." It means keeping the enemy from obtaining from anywhere in the world the things he needs to live and to make war on usthe food, the iron, the fuel, and the other materials needed to make and operate a war machine. In an age of mechanization, this type of warfare is very important. In this type of warfare the economicthe Allies had the better of the argument in World War 1. But in this war, the Axis has already reduced through conquest this economic inequality. In the military phase of war, until recently, the Axis seems to have had a definite advantage, because of longer preparation, more thorough training, and a more definite military plan than was the case with the United Nations. Our present mobilization and arms production program, as well as mass air attacks on Axis war industries, are calculated to remove this advantage. The third type of warfarethe psychologicalmeans weakening the opponent through all sorts of tricks designed to confuse, to frighten, to discourage, to mislead, and to divide. It is "an offensive war waged with intellectual and emotional weapons to destroy the power of morale resistance in the enemy's army and civilian population and to diminish enemy prestige in the eyes of the neutrals." An Axis spokesman has said, speaking of psychological warfare, that "It is essential to attack the enemy nation in its weak spots, to undermine and break down its resistance, and to convince it that it is being deceived, misled, and. Brought to destruction by its own government. 'Thus the people will lose confidence in the justice of its cause so that the political opposition in those nations will raise its head and become a more powerful trouble-maker. The enemy nation's originally solid, powerful, and well-knit fabric must be gradually disintegrated, broken down, rotted, so that it falls apart like a fungus treaded upon in a forest." Psychological warfare consists of spreading rumors, false reports, threats, and fears of deadly secret weapons. The channels through which this type of warfare is prosecuted are short-wave radio, fifth column, and rumors planted by agents of the opponents and spread by people uncritically. The type of material spread usually has to do with the strength of the aggressor, the weakness of the defender, and the futility of resistance. An attempt is made to discredit the leaders of the opposing nations. In early stages of psychological warfare, a feeling of Page 23 easy complacency is encouraged by promises of non-aggression. Psychological warfare is referred to today by news commentators as the "war of nerves," the "strategy of terror," "breaking down the home front," "demoralizing the enemy," and the "war of words," or propaganda. With the stepping up of communications, especially the radio, psychological warfare has taken on a new significance in the present war. There is nothing incomprehensible in this type of warfare, and every American should thoroughly understand it and realize how treacherously it can attack, even over many thousands of miles of land and sea. Let us, then, turn to the problem of psychological warfare as practiced against the Democracies, Freedom of ptess, of speech, and of assembly all censored or denied in totalitarian countries as a step in the psychological preparation of their own peoplein democratic countries provide fertile soil in which to wage psychological warfare. The Axis program has three principal aims: (1) to increase conflict and disunity among us; (2) to produce anxiety, fear, and confusion; and (3) to produce apathy and disillusionment. Just as the Axis strategy on the battlefield is to divide and then to conquer, so on the psychological front every possible device is employed to promote disunity among us. The starting points are our own latent prejudices. A few of the most common possibilities are racial, religious, political, national, and economic class prejudices. The efforts of the enemies of this country to stir up racial hatreds are well known, and the nearer their claims fit our prejudices, the more they stir up strife and disunity among us. Religious prejudices are easily aroused by propaganda, and political disunity is readily promoted. Repeated attempts have been made to drive wedges between the United States and Great Britain by saying that "Britain always gets someone else to pull her chestnuts out of the fire." Likewise, Japan points out to China the futility of expecting continued help from allies who have so miserably "let her down in the past." Short-wave radio propaganda from nations at war with us has been particularly directed toward stirring up economic class hatred in America. One of the corner stones of this plan of conquest is the hope that America will collapse from within because of the failure to achieve class unity. Labor is stirred up against capital, and capital against labor. Unfortunately, many people in this country are caught in this trap because of already established prejudices along this line of thinking, which, of course, invites propaganda of this character from the enemies of this country. The second general aim of psychological warfare, after divisions are fostered among the people, is to produce anxiety, fear, and confusion. This is done through pointing out to the victim the invincibility of the aggressor. It consists of a strong military power intimidating a weaker one into submission. The weak are told of the fate of other victims, and are warned of a worse fate, and impressed with the futility of resistance. This "strategy of terror' has been one of the cruelest weapons of the aggressors. If weak peoples still resisted after due warning, their fate  PSYCOLOGICAL WARFARE was as bad as promised and became a warning to the next victim. Terror is spread by several devices. Civilian bombing is perhaps the most dreadful. Bombs are even made to scream to add to the terror. Incendiaries and delayed-action bombs prolong and intensify the terror of mass raids. The threat of gas bombs has also been used to advantage. Fear has been spread by such tricks as throwing images on the clouds with huge lantern-slide projectors. _ Little does a warring nation care whether its opponents are destroyed by bombs and shells or by psychological methods so long as they cease resistance. Panic and a broken will to resist through actual combat or war work is the aim of the "strategy of terror." If psychological victories can be won, they are usually much less costly than actual military conquests. It is difficult to estimate how much aggressor armies and machines have been spared by psychological victories of the propaganda bureaus. Confusion is spread by circulating all sorts of false news reports. Reports from an opposing nation may say an attack will be made at a certain time at a certain place. Then the place will be changed. When sufficient confusion has been caused, an attack will be made at a wholly unexpected place. Confusion makes organized resistance more difficult. False reports have been circulated repeatedly in this war by nations whose armies were locked in close combat with those of other nations, often successfully dispersing and disorganizing the opposing forces. The third aim of psychological warfare is to promote apathy and disillusionment. The Axis nations have 25 been known to spread much propaganda about some great action, such as the move through the Balkans, then the talk would subside, then it would start up again and die down again. Finally, when everyone had become apathetic about it, they would strike. Japan talked of arbitrating her difficulties with United States up until the very day the attack was made on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese have repeatedly tried to disillusion the people of the United States about the reliability of the reports given them from the Navy as to losses. Japan's technique is to announcesometimes accurately, but often notUnited States' naval losses several days in advance of the Navy's reports. In the battle of Java, 'in which United States losses were severe, Japan announced them with some accuracy many days before our reportthe aim being to make it appear to the people of this country that Japan forced the Navy to make admissions it otherwise would not have made. People should constantly be on guard against this trick, remembering how important it. Is for our Navy to avoid giving information to opposing nations. Another plan is to announce several days in advance the capture of a certain city which is quite sure to be taken later. This forces a denial from the defenders at first, but an admission later when the city is actually takenall of which, it is hoped, will establish confidence in the reliability of reports from the opposing nations and a distrust of reports of one's own nation. Another trick of similar character, practiced by the Axis, is the announcement of false victories for the Democracies. Since we are watchful for good news, we may accept these reports, not suspecting their origin. Later, when reports prove untrue, we become disillusioned and confused. The secretive way in which the Axis powers plan campaigns often lulls us into a sense of false security. Our perilous plight of unpreparedness during the early months of this war was our punishment for years of this weakness. Nations at war with the United States have taken great advantage of our easy optimism and uncritical self-sufficiency. We have failed to take a proper measure of those who are against us, and we have considerably overestimated the security we have in extensive but undeveloped material resources and manpower. Nations opposing this country still feign weakness at times to lull us into this sense of false security and the resulting relaxation of effort. Another potent psychological weapon is the peace offensive. Should the United Nations appear to be really about to win the war, a strong bid for peace can surely be expected from the Axis. The hope will be to lull the Democracies back into a sense of false security, while further preparation may be made to attack them. The Axis nations real- 2 ize how "pacifistic" at heart we are, and they are sure to attempt to turn this fine ideal to our destruction. The defense against psychological warfare is as complicated as war itself. Let us hope that some understanding of what it is will aid in our resistance to it. However, civilians can prepare themselves against it in some measure by abiding by the following suggestions: First, keep reliably informed on the daily news. Learn to check habitually the sources of all reports and to evaluate their content according to their source. Second, don't carry rumors. They are the most unreliable source of news there is. Remember, most of them are planted by those opposed to us, and they are meant to confuse and mislead us. Always ask the tumor monger where he got his story. Write it down if it sounds vicious enough, then check it with your civilian defense authorities. You might thus help to find fifth columnists. Don't repeat rumors to your neighbots. Third, speak constructively of democracy and its leaders. This doesn't mean not to criticize, but it does mean to learn to see and to speak of all that is good as well as that which needs correcting. FAITH AND COURAGE The following Christmas message by Nicholas Murray Butler may appropriately be carried into the new year: Christmas Day in this year of grace will be celebrated with civilization at the lowest mark in the history of modern times. This means that more than ever men of light and leading and insight must have faith and courage and hope. They must not and cannot let their faith weaken in those everlasting ideals which must rule any civilized and peaceful world....  Little Stones that Change the Course of Rivers Lella Marler Hoggan O river runs down to the sea N without meeting with obstacles and interferences. And no life fulfills its destiny without overcoming trials and hardships. Yet we chafe under restraint. We resent interference. We become frustrated when sorrow and disappointment disrupt our plans. We feel that life should run smoothly for us. Why should our course be hampered and blocked at every turn? Why should obstacles be forever retarding our progress? Are the very fates discriminating against us? Know this, O friend, neither life nor law discriminate against anyone. We reach the high goals we set out to achieve through the conquest of difficulties. Said J. G. Holland: f We rise by the things that are 'neath our feet; By what we have mastered of good and gain. By the pride deposed and the passion slain, And the vanquished ills that we hourly meet. There is a native in his island home who believes that "the strength and valor of the enemy he kills passes into himself." Symbolically, this is true. We gain strength and development from the conquest of difficult undertakings. Disappointments and delays are often the forces that are preparing. Us to assume responsibilities of importance. We have to meet and overcome trials before we are in readiness to accept the great trusts. Said a great poet: A chance rock in an upland brook, May change a river's course. And yet no rock, No, nor the baffling mountains of the world, Can hold it from its destiny, the sea. Though a stone may divert the stream from its original channel, the water flows around it and makes its way in and out, under and over, past stick arid pebble and deadwood and growing things, on and on until it reaches the surging sea. The picturesque cataract that breaks in sparkling grandeur over a jagged cliff and spills itself in lacy rainbows down a mountain gorge, has gathered the very force that glorifies it from the obstruction that blocked its way. To accept the barriers on life's pathway as impediments to progress is to admit defeat before we have undertaken the journey. All lives are beset by struggle and pain and sorrow. This is nature's way of teaching us the things we need to know. We can't gain experience through the efforts of someone else. Our joys and sorrows must come first hand. We have to work in order to learn to work. We have to suffer in order to gain insight into life. We have to pray in order to learn what prayer means. Real values come only through earnest effort. Intellectual growth and spiritual development are not attained. By listless wishing. Emerson said: "The law of nature is, Do the thing, and you shall have the Page 27 power: but they who do not the thing have not the power." It is not the reward, but the struggle that perfects us. Effort precedes efficiency, and "joy is in the quest." Weare forever consoling ourselves with alibis and excuses for the things we have failed to accomplish. Though we can not explain our weaknesses and failures away, even to ourselves, still we can overcome them and lift ourselves nearer to the ideal that we secretly cherish. Our strength of character is measured by our mastery of the trials we have met. What we think and feel and do puts its mark upon us with indelible fingers. Truly "the gods we worship write their names on our faces." SCOUTMASTER and some members of his troop were attending a rodeo. They stood on the sidelines one morning and watched a procession march gaily down the street. Decked in full regalia, a group of Indians from a nearby reservation headed the parade. Brilliant Navajo blankets covered their horses' backs in lieu of saddles. But nothing 'excited the admiration of the on-lookers so much as the gorgeous war bonnets worn by the old Indian chieftains. These bonnets not only encircled their faces with bright feathers and other trophies, but also extended gracefully down their backs nearly to their feet. At the close of the parade a pompous young man stepped up to one of the Indians and offered him a handful of small coins for his war bonnet. The Indian silently shook his head. "Doesn't he understand the fellow?" asked one of the scouts. "Yes," said the scoutmaster, that Indian speaks English as fluently as you or I do. But his war bonnet, like your merit badges, is not for sale. Every eagle feather, every weasel tail, every bear's claw in his bonnet is a symbol of some heroic accomplishment or brave deed. The headdress represents years of effort and is a mark of honor and heroism. He would no more sell it than a king would sell his crown." The scouts understood, for each of them was wearing trophies that had cost him long hours of study and effort to obtain. They knew the delight that comes from a worthy achievement. Too often we adults miss the joy of some great accomplishment because we lack the courage or confi-. Dence to begin. We tell ourselves that we are too old or too busy or that we haven't the ability for such an undertaking. We let our fears and misgivings baffle us. We wall ourselves out from privileges we might enjoy. We permit lost opportunities to taunt us, old age to frighten us, ignorance to threaten us. Our mistakes rise up before us like shrouded ghosts in the darkness to accuse and intimidate us. Down with the wall! Banish the spectre! Forget the failures of yesterday! Are we not God's children all? And have we not been assured that He will give us strength and courage according to our need? To the valiant hearted there is no ultimate defeat. There is always a tomorrow. "True art," says Annie Pike Greenwood, "is in bringing some sort of triumph out of pain.""* Even the Master knew Gethsemane and the cross. But did He not tise to triumphant glory, to stand as the Savior of the world and as a guiding light to mankind forevermore? *Used by special permission of author.  Justice Is a Group Affair Eva Willes Wangsgaard UDITH RAWSON sat on a rag rug on the summer grass, wrapped in the warm, fruity smell of yellow roses, and thought about people and life. It had been long since she had had time to sit and think. But now the examinations were over, and she was graduated, and there was a whole glorious afternoon for her very own. She looked down at her graduation dress made of white lawn with a yoke of tucks and insertion and tuffles of Valenciennes lace; and she remembered how nearly she had come to not having it. That made her recall Edna Silver and Edna's courageous words, and the beauty of those words caught in her throat and tightened her chest; and the whole school year, just past, began to unfold in little scenes like stereopticon views. There was Crossburg the day of the examinations. 'The eighth graders from every town in the county met in the Crossburg Central schoolhouse in three crowded rooms, which had been thrown into one large hall by sliding the great doors which made up their walls. Judith sat in the room at the south where the warm May sun crept through the Venetian blinds. When she looked for Margie, her sister, she found her in the center of the middle room, but no matter how she craned her neck, she couldn't see her brother, Artie. He must be in the third room; and it was around a corner 'so that only a triangle of it was visible from where Judith sat. Every student was tense with excitement. Margie looked calm, except for that habit she had of wiping her perfectly dry lips with her handkerchief; and the pink in her cheeks was too bright. She'd be all right, though, and so would Artie whose thoughts were always slow, but exact. Judith left off thinking of her brother and sister and looked around. 'Then a teacher appeared and began writing questions on the board, and Judith bent to her work of writing answers on the paper that lay on her desk which had been provided for this purpose. All day the examinations went on. A large staff of teachers corrected papers as fast as they were handed in, so by nighttime everyone knew whether or not he had passed. To know was a relief, though some of the kids failed and cried, or even got hysterical. Judith turned her eyes away from that memory. She knew some of them, and it hurt to remember. But there were happier scenes. A girl from Hillsdale got such high marks that they called her a valedictorian, and she gave a speech at the exercises. Maybe on some other graduation day Judith could do that for her class. And here were her white lawn dress and her hat of white chiffon pleated into a bandeau covered with pink for-get-me-nots instead of the blue ones Margie wore. But she almost hadn't got them.... Ever since she had entered Mr. Peterson's eighth grade, she had felt baffled. Mr. Peterson didn't believe in special promotions. Helen 'Tanner was somehow an exception. Page 29 Maybe that was because Mr. Peterson taught her the year before; he had been promoted with the class. Helen was dainty and pretty, too, with, her auburn curls and her gray eyes that smiled flatteringly up at him from under long, dark, curled lashes. Besides she was a whole year older than Judith. "What do they think I'm running here? A kindergarten?" Mr. Peterson was tall and skinny with thin, forward-falling brown hair, and he flipped Judith's registration card as he spoke. Judith just stood there fingering the pink ribbon that tied her yellow braids into a swing, and lifted brown eyes to his spiral-like, blue-green ones, which refused to meet hers. He wasn't ever openly cross; he just hid behind soft prickles like wild lettuce, so that the damp hand of caution pressed always on her throat. If she sometimes got too excited and forgot and called out the answer, he would say, "Grown-up people wait their turns. Only babies yell for attention." Then her report card would read: Deportment Good or Fair. Not once had there been an Excellent or a Very Good the way her studies said. Father had talked and talked to her about it, but she didn't know how to change. Father said, ""Teachers are always right." Last year it had been different, because Mr. Jerome had been kind and wise like Father generally was. Even his hair curled in happy little curls, and his eyes were warm and blue. Last year there had been two classes in one roomone sixth and one seventh grade. Artie had been in the seventh with Mr. Jerome, but Margie had been in another room that was all seventh grade. Judith had been sixth grade then. With two classes in one room there had been more study time, and Judith had found it hard to keep out of mischief. She had sat in one corner among a group of boys. The daily assignments hadn't been nearly enough, so she had coached the whole group in _ arithmetic until they were two months ahead. Then it wasn't fun any more. Billy, Clyde, and Robert had liked it at first, and they were good sports, too. They didn't care if Judith was a girl, but worked with her anyway. But they lost interest. ONE day Judith had finished the last word in Self-Help by Samuel Smiles, which Mr. Jerome had lent her. There wasn't a single thing to do. Clyde was whittling a slender stick into a "guinny." "Want it, Judy?" he had whispered. "Thanks. It's cute." Judith began to tap the tiny stick with her ruler. Mr. Jerome had sat down at his desk to check a lesson. Judith had slid into the aisle and had given the toy harder and harder taps. It had leaped and fallen with a small, dropped pencil sound. Suddenly it had gone sailing through the air and had lit, plop, on Mr. Jerome's book. Judith had slipped instantly back into her seat and seized a book. Mr. Jerome had picked up the offending toy and had held it before his face. "A "guinny' is a dangerous plaything, even on the school ground," he said. He pressed his forefinger up and down on one sharp point. Then, "Here, Judith. Dispose of it."  JUSTICE lS A GROUP AFFAIR If he had pricked her with the "guinny," Judith couldn't have been more startled and ashamed, nor could she have jumped more quickly. She had walked to the desk, though, and, taking the "guinny" from his outstretched hand, had dropped it into the wire wastebasket. The incident was closed, and Mr. Jerome hadn't marked down her report card. He knew how hard she tried to hold herself back. But afterwards Judith discovered that there were interesting texts in the seventh grade desks and _ borrowed one often. And she listened to seventh grade discussions instead of getting into trouble. Even that proved embarrassing, though. One day when Mr. Jerome was directing a seventh grade geography class he asked, '""What article necessary in manufacturing is entirely absent in Brazil?" The class had sat too still. Hands were raised. Then up went Judith's hand. Mr. Jerome's kind eyes looked tired. Maybe he was wondering what the child could want now. Maybe he was weary because the seventh graders were unprepared. But he decided to settle Judith first. "What is it?" he asked. "Coal," answered Judith. Two rows of seventh grade faces came up at once and stared at Judith. Three rows of sixth grade students quit studying and giggled. Judith dropped her hot face on her desk and felt the cool, smooth touch of the maple top. Mr. Jerome raised his brows. "Where did you learn that?" "T read it." "Well, you're correct," he said, No 31 and was still for a long moment. Then he went on conducting class. At promotion time Mr. Jerome had decided harder work would be better for Judith. So he had jumped her into the eighth grade. But Mr. Peterson didn't look at things that way. He resented both her energy and her youngness. He resented all of her. This year all three of the Rawson children were in the same room. Judith hung around Margie too much, but there were no other companions in the room. She missed last -year's kids. Some of these kids were oldseyenteen and eighteen. They stayed at home so often to work in fields and orchards. Artie often stayed home to look after things while Father was away, but Judith and Margie seldom missed a day. So Margie was just right. It was Judith and Artie who were out of place. And there was Edna Silver who was an orphan and lived with a cross aunt. The other children in the room told tales about how much work she had to do each day before she came to school, and lots and lots of days she didn't get there at all. Judith had often helped her with lessons at recess, because Judith was often lonely and didn't know how to mix with these new kids. Edna learned well too. Some of the other big girls couldn't learn even when you tried your hardest, because they couldn't forget that they were older than you. But Edna wasn't like that. She thought of the work, not herself, and stuck with Judith no matter how often Judith had to go over a thing. And she was eighteen, too. She was a nice girl, but too old to play with Judith. Lizzie Shaw was Margie's playmateshe and Helen Tanner. But Lizzie didn't want Margie's little sister along and often made it plain that what she said was not for Judith's ears. Helen Tanner was all right when she and Judith studied together. But she acted just like Lizzie when it was recess time and she didn't need her. School wasn't nearly so much fun as it had been last year. But Mr. Peterson puzzled Judith more than the pupils did. When the class was in diagraming, Lizzie, Margie, Helen, and Judith read the text and went ahead almost without trouble. But if they ever got stuck, Mr. Peterson was always busy. It didn't matter much, though. One of them always found the help they needed by reading the book again. One day, Mr. Peterson was putting a diagram on the board. He made a mistake. Lizzie's hand went up. She was like that. Things were never correct or incorrect to Lizzie. They were right or wrong, and must be set straight. So she told Mr. Peterson. He was quiet and went very pale. Finally, "How would you do it?" he asked. Lizzie drew the correct diagram. Judith, Margie, and Helen nodded. Mr. Peterson said, "Well, that's right, too. Just be careful to have a reason for your diagram." Lizzie opened her mouth, then shut it tight and plunked into her seat, and the lesson went on. There was a lot of work to be done in the eighth grade and Judith liked it, but she wasn't happy. She felt choked. There were too many ways for Mr. Peterson to show what he thought of special promotion students, like asking Judith if she didn't need a rest when you could hear the younger students out at recess. Once after he had said that, Judith stood by the steps not feeling like joining in any of the games at all. Edna Silver had come up and put her arm around Judith's shoulder. "Don't let it bother you, Judy," she said. "You're all right. Keep right on going. You're the kind that can. I can't, but part of me will follow you however far you go. Now run and play." Judith smiled and ran. HEN the report cards for the third term came out, Judith  opened hers eagerly. She'd tried to be good, and maybe Mr. Peterson had noticed. But she held it down and stared at the wall. The subjects weren't so bad. You either got your lessons and passed your examinations with high marks or low, but deportment was different. That was the teacher's opinion. Now it was lower than ever and stood out like a stump in the snowP for Poor. Father would be disappointed and so would Mother. They had said that she couldn't have a new dress for graduation if she didn't improve in behavior. It was no use to talk. Teacher was always right. "It didn't matter how much you learned if you didn't know how to live," Father had said.. Judith thought and thought. She could find no reason for such a low mark. She had "called out" a few times, but so many, many times she had succeeded in holding back even when she was the only one who wanted to answer! She guessed Mr.  JUSTICE IS A GROUP AFFAIR Peterson was right. Kids shouldn't get ahead of themselves. Margie would have her new dress now, and Judith would have to wear an old one, if they let her go to the exercises at all. Still, maybe it was a mistake. Hope struck a small match. It didn't seem fair, and teachers did sometimes make mistakes in copying, just as students did. She'd go and ask him. Anyway, she might find out what was wrong so that she could improve the last term. If she did, maybe she could have her new dress after all. But Mr. Peterson wouldn't notice her. Other children were around his desk, and he kept taking new ones even after Judith was sure that it was her turn. When she tried to get attention, Mr. Peterson said, "Don't push like a baby." There was nothing to do but wait. She pushed the tears back so that she wouldn't be a baby. She felt an arm around her and looked up into Edna Silver's quiet eyes. Edna took Judith's report card, glanced at it, and handed it back. How long she had been listening and watching, Judith didn't know. But now she was speaking to Mr. Peterson. "What's wrong with Judith's behavior? I think she's a good little kid. I've learned a lot from her." She sounded defiant, but she wasn't. She was just earnest. That was evident by the light in her fine, grey eyes; and something in her voice made Mr. Peterson listen. Silence stretched like an elastic band between them, then snapped, and Edna continued, "Children are a sacred trust. They have a right to 33 fairness and to understanding." A change came over her face. "We can't play favorites. I know one who wouldn't get such good marks if she didn't borrow Judith Rawson's eraser so often during tests." Helen Tanner was putting her books into her sack. She gave Edna a swift look, and hurried out of the room with one book still in her hand. Judith stood fascinated. Mr. Peterson had the same look he had on his face the day Lizzie corrected the diagram. But Edna stood tall on her convictions, and the color flamed high in her cheeks. She wasn't fighting for Judith alone. "Ahem! Ahem!" Mr. Peterson cleared his throat, but found nothing to say. Edna hadn't finished. "Whether you play fair with Judith or not isn't just between you and the child. Justice is a group affair, and we older students expect to see justice done." Mr. Peterson looked out into the room, then dropped his eyes and went on making little fishes with his pencil on a blotter on his desk. Judith looked up. Almost every older student in the room stood in a little group in the rear looking at Edna with approving eyes. Artie was among them, straight aad tall, with his large blue eyes almost violet with concern, and those crooked little lines above his nose deeper than she had ever seen them. Judith choked and tears spilled over and ran down her cheeks. The o. Der kids were wonderful! And all this time that she had been concerned only with herself, they had known and cared.

PHILOSOPHY in a New Key: a Study in the Symbolism of Reason, Rite, and Art is a new scientific book of worth and originality by Dr. Suzanne K. Langer of Radcliffe College. One challenging idea in this book is that "man can adapt himself somehow to anything that his imagination can cope with." EDITORIAL Vol. 30 JANUARY, 1943 No. 1 A New Heart and a new Spirit CAST away from you all your: transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit...." The end of a year is a favorable time to "cast away... Transgressions" and seek to make "a new heart and a new spirit," for there is encouragement in viewing the events of the past year as being behind one and regarding the new year that lies ahead much as a book, unmarred and unmarked, containing three hundred and sixty-five blank pages on which will be written defeats or triumphs, retrogression or progress. It is true that many of the events which may affect one during the coming year arise through no volition of the individual; but the pages of this yearbook will glow with beauty or be drab and even uglynot because of events that may transpire, but according to the manner in which the individual meets these events. The most luminous page may shine with faith developed from experiencing one of life's darkest tragedies. This life is a time of testing and proving whether or not one is a true Latter-day Saint. "I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings." To write a yearbook worthy of a Latter-day Saint, one must continually study the Gospel and seek to live a life in accordance with its teachings. The more one studies, the more clearly do one's own faults and even transgressions cry out for correction. In this inward searching, the first examination may well reveal failings manifested in the home in one's daily life. Is there need of more patience and understanding for loved ones, or is there the need for more firmness and discipline? Is a resolution wanted to make every minute count? Brigham Young once said "that our time was all we could call our own, we should have to give an account of it, and therefore we should use it to the best possible advantage in assisting to build up the Kingdom of God on earth." On the other hand, should more time be devoted to the home the better to guard it, should more care be given to train one's children more perfectly in the laws and principles of the Gospel, in having family prayers and in studying the scriptures? One may also resolve to more frequently visit the sick, seek to bring cheer to the afflicted and comfort to the sorrowing, and to more faithfully attend to one's Church duties. But perhaps it is wisdom not to undertake too many resolutions at once, although one does naturally continually strive to improve in many ways. One or two resolutions faithfully kept are better than many abandoned before the keeping has become a habit. It is well, finally, when making a resolution to live and plan for the day alone and let the tomorrows wait until they in turn become today. The present moment is the only time that must be lived. If then as each succeeding year advances, resolutions are made and kept looking toward improvement and development, these resolutions will, in time, serve as stepping stones to a better life; and the yearbooks will glow ever brighter illuminating a character striving to obey that great dictum, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect."M.
