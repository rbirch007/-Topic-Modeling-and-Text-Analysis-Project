Messages for the New Year From Members of the Relief Society General Board IT has been said that nobody worries about Christ and His teachings so long as they are kept shut up in the churches, but that there is always trouble and perplexity if you try to bring them out. As the new year is ushered in and the second century of Relief Society begins, let us as members of this great humanitarian organization resolve to do our part in bringing forward the teachings of the Master, in applying them in our lives, and in advocating them to our fellow men, thus contributing to the establishment of the kingdom of God on earth. President Amy Brown Lyman 66TN Thee, O Lord, do I put my trust;" (Psalm 31:1). Shall we now, as daughters of our Heavenly Father, rededicate our lives to His work? Nothing we do in His service can be too well or too beautifully done. His spirit, as our constant companion, is our greatest need. It is a privilege to work in His vineyard in any capacity. We were given the Relief Society organization by a prophet of God. Activity in this Church auxiliary helps us to go forward with gratitude in our hearts for our privileges and blessings. May salvation and eternal life crown our earnest efforts. Counselor Marcia K. Howells [ is a great blessing to face life with a testimony of the truthfulness of the Gospelto know that God lives, that life has purpose and direction, and that the relationships of friends and loved ones will continue beyond this life. The work of Relief Society strengthens testimonies and provides abundant opportunity for the application of Gospel principles. Fortunate, Page 5  indeed, are women who are identified with this Society, either as members or as officers. May the experiences of the new year deepen our insight, increase our understanding, and add to our desire to serve our Father and our fellow men. Counselor Belle S. Spafford
LASTING world peace can be established only through the brotherhood of man, a state of fellow feeling which harbors neither national nor racial prejudices. Relief Society is making its contribution toward this goal. This sisterhood includes women who are of the black, brown, yellow, red, and white races, and citizens of more than a score of nations. Yet each of these is "sister" to all other members of the Society, and all are striving to better understand and live according to the principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christthe sure path to individual and universal peace. General Secretary-Treasurer Vera W. Pohlman
WITH almost global war, every member of most families is feeling the impact. Restlessness, adapting to new work, adjusting to a loved one's absence, restricted movements, insecurity, all play their part in intensifying the role that the home needs to play. Changing conditions bring different opportunities to women. The woman of faith and sweet spirit can make her home a haven of comfort in times of trouble. The family prayers, the spoken acceptance of our Heavenly Father as the guardian of all, the understanding heart, the love transformed into servicethe memories of these will fortify our families in the battle for present-day existence. Donna D. Sorensen
I DESIRE an abiding faith in the Lord, sufficient to sustain and succor me. What I yearn for, I wish for you. The new year, 1943, will be a year fraught with anxieties, but those who trust in the Lord will be assuaged. Present events help us realize how dependent we are upon Him. Pause and think deeply and have hope and vision for your needs. Faith and vision become strong and clear, and sustain those who keep the commandments of the Lord. "They who have faith in Him will cleave unto every good thing." May you have peace surpassing understanding, is my earnest desire. Vivian R. McConkie
RELIEF SOCIETY is beginning a new year in a new century with the world perilously threatened by the holocaust of evil forces. When we see the human misery and the destruction which follow in the wake of these forces, it makes us feel the preciousness of good; of God's great laws for living together in love. It makes us appreciate our heritagea sustaining peace and the opportunity for organized work in the cause of human uplift. Let us rededicate ourselves to the noble purposes of Relief Society and help bring to the world a charity which is the true love of Christ. Nellie O. Parker
MESSAGES FOR THE NEW YEAR 7
"MAN is at his finest toward the finish of the year; He is almost what he should be, when the Christmas season's here; He is less a selfish creature than at any other time; When the Christmas spirit rules him, he comes close to the sublime." Our faith strikes the proper balance between the material and the spiritual forces of life. You have exemplified this thought through your belief in religious principles combined with the doing of noble service. May 1943 bring joys that will remain long in your memory, and may high achievement reward your efforts throughout the new year. Achsa E. Paxman
TO my sisters of the Relief Societyparticularly those who, like myself, have sons in the armed forces of our countryI send this message: Be of good cheer. Your Heavenly Father loves you and will be mindful of you. Mary Grant Judd
GREETINGS and best wishes to you noble Relief Society womenyou who will be quietly and faithfully performing the tasks that each day of the new year brings. In these days of confusion and trouble, you Latter-day Saint women are blessed above all others in the world. You have an anchor in your knowledge and testimony of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Hold fast to this precious anchor and you will continue to be sustained and blessed by your Heavenly Father. Luella N. Adams
THIS is a day of sorrow upon the earth. As Latter-day Saints, however, we know that we are privileged to be permitted to live during this great Dispensation of the Fullness of Times. We realize that the righteous must suffer with the wicked, but that "Those that die in me shall not taste of death, for it shall be sweet unto them." At this Christmastide let us, as Relief Society members, fill our souls with love for Him who was "a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief." Let us rejoice "because he hath poured out his soul unto death" whereby we may all partake of a glorious resurrection. Marianne C. Sharp
"GLORY to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men". 
The most soul-satisfying experiences we have in life, especially during these troubled times, are the efforts we make to live the Gospel of Jesus Christ. May this season of His birth bring to each member of Relief Society in all the world a strong and abiding testimony of the mission of our Savior, so that no matter what vicissitudes of life touch us from the outside, within we may have that peace which comes from good will toward men. Leda T. Jensen
AT the beginning of another year, in a new century for Relief Society, I pray earnestly for Latter-day Saint women everywhere that by the power of the Holy Spirit each may see her course clearly; that each shall do her work with wisdom and in kindness; that each shall be strong and unafraid, preparing herself through faith and knowledge to meet every day in the new year and every situation ahead with serenity and peace of soul. "For they that have received the truth... And have taken the Holy Spirit for their guide, and have not been deceived... Shall abide the day." (Doctrine and Covenants 45:57) Rae B. Barker
"THESE things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace." In these days of world-wide distress, how grateful we should be for the Gospel of Jesus Christ and for our testimonies of its truthfulness. The mission of the Savior was one of peace and love, and it is through the application of His teachings in our lives that we can meet the problems of this day with courage. Christ's message is expressed in the spirit and character of Relief Society. To be identified with this organization is a blessing. Let us help to further this great cause, "that in Him we may have peace." Anna S. Barlow
THIS is the birth of a new year and of a new Relief Society century! The stress of the present stirs us to super accomplishment. The achievement of the past has made us feel our powers. The prophetic urge for organization a century ago is a hundredfold today. May we look forward with the enthusiasm and dreams of youth, but with vision. May we face the new century as we face a new day. May our lives radiate fortitude and inner peace, that we may help bring universal love to the world. This is the birth of a new century for Relief Society. What a challenge to us! Anna Boss Hart
MESSAGES FOR THE NEW YEAR 9
"BLESSED is he that is faithful in tribulation, the reward of the same is greater in the kingdom of heaven. For after much tribulation come the blessings." Let us as Relief Society members be comforted by these words of our Lord. For even though the past year has literally been a year of tribulation, we as Latter-day Saints have a great many blessings for which to be thankful. May we enter this new year with hope in our hearts and a prayer on our lips that we may so live as to be worthy of the blessings promised to the faithful. Gertrude R. Garff
EVEN though Relief Society women have been heavily burdened by thick, dark forces, they have not lost their way. They dream dreams and see the vision of a new morning, and a spring come again; their faith is ever fresh. Not necessarily the great or the strong, but the seemingly unimportant women among us are spreading blessings, making small things worthy of eternal remembrance. Theirs is a healing virtue in toil and trouble. Truly their outlook is wider and deeper than the number of years lived or the accumulation of encumbering goods. May our Heavenly Father continue to bless the daughters of Zion. Leona F. Wintch
TO all of my Relief Society sisters I send greetings, and hope the new year will bring all that your hearts desire in righteousness. Edith Smith Elliott
AT the beginning of another century of Relief Society, I desire to express my love and appreciation to all the wonderful women who have served so loyally in this organization. May you continue to feel that it is a privilege to live, to work, to sacrifice, to endure, to love; and may you realize that you are instruments in God's kingdom in helping to work out His purposes among men. If you continue faithful, the peace of God which passeth all understanding will be yours; moreover, each of you will be capable of making the circle in which you live better and happier. Pauline T. Pingree
AT the beginning of this new year our love and prayers go out to our 115,000 Relief Society members. May God's choicest blessings attend you during the coming year and always. 
Whatever the future holds, may you be true to the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, and may you have the courage, fortitude, and determination to live righteously. By being members of the Church, you are heirs to a precious heritage, and by keeping the commandments of God and conforming to the Gospel teachings and by consecrating your lives to the work of the Lord, you are entitled to life eternal, the Divine gift to mankind. Alice B. Castleton
MY wish for you, my dear sisters, is that the Christmas just passed will be remembered as a happy one and that blessings may attend you in the new year. To those homes saddened by the loss of loved ones, may our Heavenly Father send comfort and consolation; to firesides where parents, wives, or other beloved ones are bravely carrying on with anxiety in their hearts, may He send patience and faith; and to homes blessed with the laughter of happy children may He send His spirit to protect the household and to guide those who there reside, that loyalty and courage and kindness may reign therein. Priscilla L. Evans
"TAKE from out the Old Year only the experiences and achievements that will enrich and make for a better New Year." A hundred years of valuable experiences have contributed to the dynamic strength and power of our great Relief Society organization. As the new year approaches, let us greet every day with unfaltering step, with a prayer in our hearts and a song on our lips, with courage and with faith in the fulfillment of the Divine promise that: "If with all your hearts ye truly seek me, ye shall ever surely find me. Thus saith our God." Florence Jepperson Madsen
I SEND my love and new year's greetings to the members of Relief Society. For many months we have lived in the midst of a world at war, and of necessity we have had to readjust our lives to varied and changing conditions. More than ever before, I believe, we should exert every effort to live our religion and keep the commandments of the Lord. If we do this, we will merit His protection and blessings, and then, whatever the future may hold for us, it will be according to His will. My prayers and good wishes are for your welfare and happiness. Ann P. Nibley
