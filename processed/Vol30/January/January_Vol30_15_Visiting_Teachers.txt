visiting teachers, when making regular visits for the month of February, will leave at each home a leaflet on these matters issued by the General Board of Relief Society.
First-Aid Kits for Families: The leaflet contains a recommended list of first-aid supplies for families, not only those families in war risk areas but families in all other areas as well, for use in case of accident or household emergencies. It is recognized that it may not at all times be possible to procure all the articles listed, but it is suggested that families provide themselves with such articles and partial quantities as can be procured. Many families doubtless already have on hand most of the articles in the recommended list of supplies and need only to take stock of the supplies which are on hand, to assemble them in a receptacle which is easy to carry and keep them in a safe and readily accessible place. The leaflet includes excerpts, reprinted with permission from the American Red Cross First Aid Text Book, describing the various articles recommended for the family first-aid kit and explaining their uses.
