A New Heart and a new Spirit CAST away from you all your: transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit...." The end of a year is a favorable time to "cast away... Transgressions" and seek to make "a new heart and a new spirit," for there is encouragement in viewing the events of the past year as being behind one and regarding the new year that lies ahead much as a book, unmarred and unmarked, containing three hundred and sixty-five blank pages on which will be written defeats or triumphs, retrogression or progress. It is true that many of the events which may affect one during the coming year arise through no volition of the individual; but the pages of this yearbook will glow with beauty or be drab and even uglynot because of events that may transpire, but according to the manner in which the individual meets these events. The most luminous page may shine with faith developed from experiencing one of life's darkest tragedies. This life is a time of testing and proving whether or not one is a true Latter-day Saint. "I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings." To write a yearbook worthy of a Latter-day Saint, one must continually study the Gospel and seek to live a life in accordance with its teachings. The more one studies, the more clearly do one's own faults and even transgressions cry out for correction. In this inward searching, the first examination may well reveal failings manifested in the home in one's daily life. Is there need of more patience and understanding for loved ones, or is there the need for more firmness and discipline? Is a resolution wanted to make every minute count? Brigham Young once said "that our time was all we could call our own, we should have to give an account of it, and therefore we should use it to the best possible advantage in assisting to build up the Kingdom of God on earth." On the other hand, should more time be devoted to the home the better to guard it, should more care be given to train one's children more perfectly in the laws and principles of the Gospel, in having family prayers and in studying the scriptures? One may also resolve to more frequently visit the sick, seek to bring cheer to the afflicted and comfort to the sorrowing, and to more faithfully attend to one's Church duties. But perhaps it is wisdom not to undertake too many resolutions at once, although one does naturally continually strive to improve in many ways. One or two resolutions faithfully kept are better than many abandoned before the keeping has become a habit. It is well, finally, when making a resolution to live and plan for the day alone and let the tomorrows wait until they in turn become today. The present moment is the only time that must be lived. If then as each succeeding year advances, resolutions are made and kept looking toward improvement and development, these resolutions will, in time, serve as stepping stones to a better life; and the yearbooks will glow ever brighter illuminating a character striving to obey that great dictum, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect."M.
