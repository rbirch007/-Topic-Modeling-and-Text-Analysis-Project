Notes to THE FIELD
Leaflets on Health, Home Nursing and First Aid to be Distributed in February, 1943
CONTINUING the century-long interest and activity of the Relief Society in health and nursing, the General Board urges that all families take precautions to preserve health through such means as proper nutrition, adequate clothing and bedding, and general care, suggests that all families, insofar as possible, provide themselves with first aid supplies, and advises the women to take courses in first aid or home nursing, or both, and to cooperate with their local Relief Societies in the establishment of home nursing supply chests. These suggestions are of special importance during the present war conditions because of possibility of disaster or epidemic, and because of curtailment of hospital and nursing service for civilians, making it necessary to depend to great extent on home nursing.
