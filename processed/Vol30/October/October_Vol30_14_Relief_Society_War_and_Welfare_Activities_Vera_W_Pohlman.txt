RELIEF SOCIETY WAR AND WELFARE ACTIVITIES HE Relief Society annual report for 1942, published in the recent June-July issue of the Magazine, indicated for Relief Societies throughout the Church the extent of war and welfare services by the Society. Part of this report dealt with Relief Society sewing service at local Relief Society meetingssewing service for the Society and its members, for the Church Welfare Program, and for the Red Cross and other worthy community agencies. 'This report indicated that an average of nearly 29,000 women gave sewing service at each monthly work meeting to the extent of approximately 382,000 hours, during which 116,882 articles were com- | pleted. Of this total number of articles, the greatest number (38,381 or approximately one-third of the total) was made for the Red Cross, with 29,048 being made for Relief Society, 19,446 for bishops' storehouses, and 30,007 for hospitals and all other agencies. Clothing for children constituted the largest group, according to kinds of articles made. Next in importance were quilts, which, for one hundred years, have symbolized Relief Society sewing service. It was in the Society's second year, in a meeting held October Page 626 14, 1843, that Phebe M. Wheeler, the assistant secretary, proposed "that a sewing society be appointed that garments and bed clothing may be made and given to such as are suffering cold and nakedness." Quilts made during 1942 numbered 13,034-and it is expected that quilts made during 1943 will greatly exceed this number, for 1943 is doubtless the greatest quilt-making year so far in Relief Society. In addition to the usual number of quilts made, the Society undertook an assignment by the Church Welfare Committee to fill an assignment in the ratio of one quilt to every one hundred Church members, these quilts to be turned into bishops' storehouses. In addition, the General Board of Relief Society recommended that all Societies in war risk areas provide themselves with ward first-aid supplies, including 12 quilts or blankets. Furthermore, the General Board also suggested that a final check be made to discover whether all families were adequately supplied with bedding, and urged that encouragement and assistance be given to help families complete their bedding supplies. Many stake and ward Relief Societies had already conducted bedding projects for the benefit of families with- NOTES FROM THE FIELD 627 OVER 100 QUILTS WERE DISPLAYED AT THIS RELIEF SOCIETY QUILTING IN THE EMERY WARD, EMERY STAKE, 1943 in their boundaries. 'The following reports from wards and stakes reflect the activities of the Society with respect to the quilt-making project for the Church Welfare Program, the bedding plans for the benefit of members, Red Cross sewing, and other war Services. Emery Stake (Utah) MYRLE B. JOHANSEN, stake secretary-treasurer, recently wrote as follows: "A suggestion given in one of the bulletins from the General Board that Relief Societies encourage their members to repair | and make new bedding, while materials were available, resulted in a most profitable project in the Emery Ward of our stake. "They called it the 'Help One Another Project,' and every woman in the ward was invited to participate. The project covered a period of two and one-half months, and' approximately 3,246 hours were spent in quilting. Over 158 quilts were made. At the time the accompanying picture was taken, over 100 quilts were displayed. Six quilts were made for Church Welfare at one time, and over eighty women were present. Light refreshments were served at every quilting. Wynona Petty is president of the Emery Ward. "At the present time, this ward has a very worthy summer project for their visiting teachers. Each month a social is given in every district, at the home of a widow, a service star mother, or an aged sister. The program is made up by those living in the district and many participate who have not had the privilege of doing so before." Los Angeles Stake (California) EMMA LYM, secretary of the Beverly Hills Ward, reports: "Our Relief Society anniversary celebration was a success in every respect. An old-fashioned quilting party was held on March 11. A pleasant program was presented during the quilting and a luncheon served. On March 17 a number of our members went to the Red Cross Blood Bank and gave blood donations. It was felt that no better way could be found to adequately commemorate the anniversary of the Society. "For our closing party the entire group reported at the Red Cross center at the El Rodeo School in Beverly Hills on June 3. The morning was spent preparing surgical dressings and rolling bandages. The women found it an enjoyable as well as useful occupation. Lach _ sister brought a box lunch and at noon adjourned to Roxbury Park. Here lunches were exchanged and enjoyed. After lunch an informal program was presented for the pleasure of all present. "We are happy to report that these activities of small service have been highly successful in increasing the spirit of cooperation and friendship among the members of Beverly Hills Ward." Young Stake (New Mexico) EMMA B. EVANS, president of the very small Relief Society at Shiprock, New Mexico, reported in June: "We have made quilts and dresses and sold them in the store here. We have made molasses taffy, popcorn balls, etc., and sold them to the sweet-hungry school children. By May 26, which we had set as our $100 goal, we had purchased $100 worth of war bonds and sold quilts and two dresses besides. We have six members." Navajo-Zuni Mission (New Mexico) EMMA B. EVANS of Shiprock was recently appointed with her husband, President Ralph William Evans, to preside over the new Navajo-Zuni Mission. When she wrote in June, there were no organized Relief Societies among these Indian women, but many of them who were interested were assisting with the Sunday School and Primary Association meetings, and doing missionary work. She reported as follows her visit to Crystal, New Mexico, "away up in the tops of the mountains" where the only full-time missionary was stationed: "This lady missionary had taught the Navajo women to make quilts. I wish you could see the two quilt tops they have made. One is put together with bright green and the other with a very bright yellow. The quilt blocks are perfect, every color blended and stitched as perfectly as their Navajo blankets are made. Instead of cutting their blocks as they would come on the material, the conventional flower design was in the center of each diamond, giving it an appliqued effect. Their faces shone when I told them that I would send the cotton for the first one, and how lovely they were. They intend to make and sell enough quilts to buy an organ or piano for their little church. "You would thnill with pride if you were to see the little one-roomed church which they reconditioned with the help of Jim Collyer, the Mormon trader there. It has a good floor, newly painted walls, good benches, bright Navajo colors at the neatly curtained windows. Our visit was unexpected, but vases of evergreen and flowers adorned tables and  NOTES FROM THE FIELD windows, and Brother Polocca was on hand to take charge of the meeting. This new member has full charge since there are no missionaries there now. Just lately a protestant church there had six missionaries holding revival meetings, but this staunch new member held his ground and carried on in face of great opposition." Shelley Stake (Idaho) SADIE KIRKHAM, stake sewing leader, at the request of Annie B. Johnsen, stake Relief Society president, reported in 1942: "In one Relief Society bedding project we have quilted 410 quilts. People who could afford to do so paid for the work, and the money was used to buy quilts and blankets for those who could not afford to pay. Then the stake Relief Society cooperated in a government mattress project. We made 207 mattresses. Through the applications for mattresses we learned the real needs of the people in our stake better than we could have found out in any other way. It has been a big undertaking, but we have enjoyed the satisfaction of knowing we have helped people to have warm bedding who have never had it before, and we surely need it in Idaho." Southern Arizona Stake (Arizona) GLADYS E. HUISH, president of Southern Arizona Stake Relief Society, reported in 1942 details of this stake's bedding project: "First, we decided to ask each member to 629 have enough bedding on hand to last for five years and gave them a suggestive list to go by. To help the women with their quilts, each ward organization offered to quilt one quilt without charge for each member who would prepare and furnish her own material; some wards quilted one and tied one for each member. Of course, there were some who did not need any quilts made and a few who could not afford to buy materials. For the latter, the association bought the material and quilted the quilts. We suggested for the sheets and slips that they take advantage of the layaway plan early before prices were raisedwhich many did. We made each ward president responsible for her own members. "When we took a survey early in October, we found that 70 per cent of our women had enough bedding for 5 years, many others for 3 years, some for only one, and a very few who hadn't done anything. Our presidents will still work with these few. "In order to get so many quilts quilted most of the wards met regularly in work meetings each Tuesday allsummer. Some held all-day work meetings every Tuesday. For our clothing project we asked the families to try to have enough clothes besides the ones they were wearing to last children for one year, and adults for two years. 'To help them with this, we submitted a suggestive list to go by. Each ward was also asked to lay away four complete layettes for infantsand have done so."

Earth;.... That Christ will reign personally upon the Lesson Aim: To show that after the cleansing of the earth by fire and the destruction of all wicked people upon the earth, that Christ will reign personally during the Millenium, and that during the millennial reign things not yet accomplished will be fulfilled preparatory to the end of the world. CONDENSATION OF CHAPTER 20, First and Second Advents The facts of our Lord's birth in the flesh, of His thirty and three years of life among mortals, of His ministry, sufferings, and death, are accepted as attested history. "In the meridian of time" Christ was born to earth, amid humble surroundings. His coming had been _ heralded through the previous centuries, even from the dawn of human existence. Every important incident connected with His birth, life, death, triumphal resurrection, and ultimate glo as King, Lord and God, had been predicted. Judah and Israel had been told to prepare for the coming of the Page 630 TALMAGE'S, ARTICLES OF FAITH Anointed One; yet when He came to His own, they received Him not. Similarly benighted are they who reject the prophetic evidence of His second coming, and who fail to read the signs of the times, which declare the event, at once glorious and tertible, to be near. Christ's Second Coming Predicted and Signs Described; Biblical Prophecies The prophets of the Old Testament, and those of Book of Mormon record who lived and wrote before the era of Christ, had little to say regarding the second coming of the LESSON DEPARTMENT Lord in comparison with their numerous and explicit predictions concerning His first advent. The Lord's second advent was foretold by these prophets, however, as the scriptures abundantly aver (Ps. 50:1, 3; Isa. 35:4, 5-10; 40:10; Jude 14, 15; Pearl of Great Price, Moses 7:60, etc.). Jesus taught the disciples that His mission in the flesh was to be of short duration, and that He would come again to earth, for we find them inquiring in this wise: "Tell us, when shall these things be? And what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?" In reply, our Lord detailed many of the signs of the latter times (Matt. Chap. 24; Luke Chap. 21), the last and greatest of which He thus stated: "And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come," (Matt. 24:14). With great clearness, Jesus spoke of the worldliness in which the children of men had continued to indulge, even to the eve of the deluge, and on the day of the fiery destruction which befell the Cities of the Plains, and added: "Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed" (Luke 17:26-30). At the time of the ascension, as the apostles stood gazing into the firmament where a cloud had hidden the resurrected Lord from sight, they became aware of the presence of two visitants in white apparel, who said: "Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven" (Acts 1:11). 631 Among Book of Mormon Prophecies 'Among Book of Mormon prophecies it is sufficient to consider here the personal assurances of Christ at the time of His ministrations to the Nephites in His resurrected state. In promising the three disciples the desire of their hearts, He said, "Ye shall live to behold all the doings of the Father unto the children of men, even until all things shall be fulfilled according to the will of the Father, when I shall come in my glory with the powers of heaven" (III Nephi 28:7-8). Rd The Word-of Modern Revelation The word of modern revelation is no less sure regarding the appointed advent of the Redeemer (Doctrine and Covenants 33:17; 34:6-7; 45: 37-44). The Precise Time of Christ's Coming The precise time of His coming has not been made known unto man (Doctrine and Covenants 49:7; Matt. 25:13; 24:42, 44; Mark 13: 33 35; Luke 12:40; etc.). His coming will be a surprise to those who have ignored His warnings, and who have failed to watch. Christ's Reign; The Kingdom The scriptures abound with declarations that the Lord will yet reign among His people, and that His kingdom will be everlasting (Ps. 10:16; 29:10; 145:13; 146:10; Jer. 10:10; Dan. 4:34-37; 7:27; Micah 4: 7; Luke 1:33; Rev. 11:15). Kingdom and Church Although the phrases "kingdom of heaven," "kingdom of God," 632 "kingdom of Christ" or simply "kingdom" may be used interchangeably, a careful study of the context in each instance may be necessary to a proper comprehension of the writer's intent (Doctrine and Covenants 65: 2, 5-6). At the time of His glorious advent, Christ will be accompanied by the hosts of righteous ones who have already passed from earth; and saints who are still alive on earth are to be quickened and caught up to meet Him, then to descend with Him as partakers of His glory (Doctrine and Covenants 88:91-98). With Him too will come Enoch and his band of the pure in heart; and a union will be effected with the kingdom of God, or that part of the kingdom of heaven previously established as the Church of Christ on earth; and the kingdom on earth will be one with that in heaven. Then will be realized a fulfillment of the Lord's own prayer, given as a pattern to all who pray: "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" (Matt. 6:10). The Millennium During the millennial era, both mortal and immortal beings will tenant the earth, and communion with heavenly powers will be common. Vicarious work for the dead will continue with renewed fervor. Satan shall be bound, and when he is loosed again he shall only reign for a little season, and then cometh the end of the earth (Doctrine and Covenants 43:30-31). Then the earth will pass to its celestial condition and become a fit abode for the glorified sons and daughters of God. The Millennium should be considered as a sabbatical eraa thousand years of peace, wherein enmity between man and beast shall cease, and love shall rule (Pearl of Great Price, Moses 7:65; Isa. 11:6-9; 65: 17, 20-25; Doctrine and Covenants 29:11, 22-23; 43:30-31; 63:49-51; 77: 12), SUGGESTIONS FOR CLASS PROCEDURE Suggested Songs "Come, Thou Glorious Day of Promise," by Alex Neibaur, Relief Society Songs, page 52; Latter-day Saint Hymns, No. 275.

LESSON DEPARTMENT Pictures Well-selected pictures add interest to the lesson and create an appropriate atmosphere. Famous pictures of Christ might be used in connection with this lesson. (Pictures may be obtained at small cost from the Perry Picture Co.; Malden, Massachusetts. ) Suggested Questions and Study Helps (Note: In early editions of The Articles of Faith by James E. Talmage, a series of questions and suggestive exercises were included. The following were prepared by the author for this particular chapter: ) 1. Compare the conditions attending Christ's first advent, with those predicted for His second coming. 2. Cite scriptural prophecies regarding the second coming of Christ, with attendant signs: 1, Biblical; 2, Book of Mormon; 3, modern. 3. What evidence have you to prove that the predicted second coming of Christ is near at hand? 4. What is known as to the time of His coming? 5- Show by scripture that Christ is to reign as King on earth. 6. Demonstrate the relation between the kingdom of God and the Church of Christ. 7. Show the distinctive sense in which kingdom of God and the kingdom of heaven are spoken of in modern revelation. 8. What will be the position of honest and honorable men who are not members of the Church when the kingdom of heaven is established? 9. What is the Millennium? 10. Give scriptural authority for your belief as to the conditions that are to characterize the Millennium. 11. What will be the condition of Satan during and after the Millennium? 633 Suggestions for the Use of the Questions The question is a "major mainspring to mental activity." The question-and-answer method is one of the important teaching methods and, if properly handled, may be made to contribute effectively to the aims of teaching. Questions should be clear and concise. One important purpose of questions is to stimulate and direct thinking; that is, to start the class members on a line of thought and then to direct their thought movement to a given conclusion or goal. The use of questions should be carefully planned. They should contribute to the development of the lesson and to the realization of lesson aims. The "Suggested Questions and Study Helps" may be used in a variety of ways: 1. They may be used by the class leader _as a guide for her preparation of the lesson. 2. The entire list of questions and study helps may be given to the members of the class as a guide for the preparation of the lesson by all the class members. 3. Certain questions may be assigned to individual class members for special reports. These reports should be limited as to time and introduced by the class leader at the proper places in the presentation of her lesson. 4. Three or four of the questions could be given to the entire class for special thought and preparation, and the remaining questions given to individuals for special preparation. 5. A question could be assigned to a committee of three or four members the month before the lesson presentation. On the day of the lesson presentation, one of the three members could report for the committee. This method could be used to give many members in a large class definite assignments. The pre-meeting of the committee would give the members an opportunity of getting better acquainted with the lesson and with each other. 6. These questions could be used as a review of the lesson. Note: The class members should be urged to bring the standard works of the Church. They should be urged to study these lessons before they are discussed in class. SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL Discourses of Brigham Young, edition 1925: Christ will not cease his labors pertaining to this earth until it is redeemed and sanctified, ready to be presented spotless to the Father Page 45. The Savior has not finished his work, and cannot receive the fulness of his glory until the influence and power of the wicked are overcome and brought into subjection. When the wicked inhabitants of the earth, the beasts of the field, fowls of the air, fish of the sea, all mineral substances, and all else pertaining to this earth, are overcome, then he will take the kingdom, present it to the Father, and say, "Here is the work you gave me to doyou made the appointmentI have wrought faithfully, and here are my brethren and sisters who have wrought with me. We have wrought faithfully, together; we have overcome the flesh, hell and the Devil. I have overcome, they have followed in my footsteps, and here are all thou hast given me; I have lost none, except the sons of perdition.Page 45. When he again visits this earth, he will come to thoroughly purge his kingdom from wickedness, and, as ruler of the nations, to dictate and administer to them as the heir to the kingdom; and the Gentiles will be as much mistaken in regard to his second advent as the Jews were in relation to the firstPage 46. Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, compiled by Joseph Fielding Smith, 1938 edition: Signs of Second Coming Have Commenced Mea profess to prophesy. I will prophesy that the signs of the coming of the Son of Man are already commenced. One pestilence will desolate after another. We shall soon have war and bloodshed. The moon will be turned into blood. I testify of these things, and that the coming of the Son of Man is nigh, even at your doors. If our souls and our bodies are not looking forth for the coming of the Son of Man; and after we are dead, if we are not looking forth, we shall be among those who are calling for the rocks to fall upon them. Page 160. Hearts of Children Turn to Fathers The hearts of the children of men will have to be turned to the fathers, and the fathers to the children, living or dead, to prepare them for the coming of the Son of Man. If Elijah did not come, the whole earth would be smitten.Page 160. Judah must return, Jerusalem must be rebuilt, and the temple, and water come out from under the temple, and the waters of the Dead Sea be healed. It will take some time to rebuild the walls of the city and the temple, etc.; and all this must be done before the Son of Man will make His appearance. 'There will be wars and rumors of wars, signs in the heavens above and on the earth beneath, the sun turned into darkness and the moon to blood, earthquakes in divers places, the seas heaving beyond their bounds; then will appear onc grand sign of the Son of Man in heaven. But what will the world do? They will say it is a planet, a comet, etc. But the Son of Man will come as the sign of the coming of the Son of Man, which will be as the light of morning cometh out of the east.Pages 286-287.  LESSON DEPARTMENT 635 Visiting Teachers Messages to the Home Sources of Strength Lesson 4The Development of Strength Through Work Tuesday, January 4, 1944 WORK, we repeat, is a panacea for the ills of life. It is a source of joy and the price of things most worthwhile, the only path to be pursued that will bring satisfaction and victory to each individual. To quote Carlyle, "Labor is worship," and he declares it to be the greatest discovery beneath the sun. No man nor woman can be truly happy who does not carry some responsibility and do some useful work. Blessed is the man who has found his work, who can lose himself in it, who gets joy out of it, who comes to it in the morning with gladness in his heart. To quote Proverbs 22:29: "Seest thou a man diligent in his business? He shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men." There is a well-known story of a farmer who, on his deathbed, called his three idle sons about him to impart to them an important secret. "My sons," said he, "a great treasure is hidden in the estate which I am about to leave to you." The old man gasped.. "Where is it hid?" exclaimed the sons. "I am about to tell you," said the old man. "You will have to dig for it.' But his breath failed him before he could impart the weighty secret, and he died. Forthwith, the sons set to work to spade and dig the long-neglected field, and they turned over every sod and clod upon the estate. They discovered no treasure, but they learned to work; and when the field was sown and the harvest came, lo, the yield was prodigious, in consequence of the thorough tilling which it had received. Then it was that they discovered the treasure of which their wise father had advised themit was the yield of the estate from their own labors. Happiness never resides in what an individual has, but always in what the individual does. "The more a man works, the longer he lives. 'The less he works, the sooner he dies." There is only one person for whom there is no hope, and that's the idler. "The idler shall not eat the bread of the laborer." Much work may be required in making a home and keeping it. 'This is often hard and monotonous work, but commonplace as it may seem, it is vitally important. Home building, in its truest meaning, is one of the greatest of the fine arts. The home is the center of happiness, a source of civilization. Work Thank God for the might of it, The ardor, the urge, the delight of it, Work that springs from the heart's desire Setting the soul and the brain on fire. Oh, what is so good as the heat of it, And what is so glad as the beat of it, And what is so kind as the stern command Challenging brain and heart and hand? Angela Morgan If the Almighty should come to me with complete success in his right hand and cternal struggle in his left, I would choose the left.Socrates. Discussion 1. What are some of the physical values of work? The psychological, particularly in times of mental or emotional strain? 2. Give specific instances from Church history in which the importance of work has been emphasized by Church leaders.

Of all the ways of getting on in the world, the shortest and best is to make people believe that it will be to their interest to help you along.La Bruyere. THE home affords the best environment for learning management, and family cooperation is an important factor in the successful management of homes in today's busy world. The parent needs to realize the importance of housekeeping experience for the child as a means of development, and as an expeditious method of solving housekeeping problems. Pressure of many kinds causes mothers to say, "It takes less time to do it myself." This statement reflects a lack of recognition of the important place management plays in living in a modern world, as well as the value of family effort in housekeeping. At different periods of time, the customs and habits of people have differed. 'The problems of housekeeping and homemaking have changed with each succeeding period. Weare confronted today with a situation wherein that which we have must be given great care, because of the difficulties of replacement. This is particularly true if we would preserve, in beauty, our floors and floor coverings. 'Their attractive appearance and the service which they give depend in large measure upon how they are cared for. Volumes have been written upon the subject of floors and their finishings, coverings, and care. Hard and  LESSON DEPARTMENT soft pine, maple, ash, and oak are the woods most frequently used for floors. Soft pine has the advantage of being least expensive. Oak is considered by many persons to be the best wood for floor uses, particularly if it is quarter-sawed. Maple, however, is preferred by those who like light-colored wood floors. Wood floors that are stained, painted, oiled or waxed have grown steadily in favor and are now in general use. These floors are usually partly covered by rugs, large or small. There is much to be said in favor of these finished floors. When well kept, they are very beautiful; and they may be kept so by daily dusting with a dry mop and an occasional thorough cleaning and refinishing. Rugs used on these floors may be cleaned as often as necessary without great effort and are easily reversed, which lengthens their wear. Thus the finished-wood and rugcovered floor is more sanitary and has other advantages over the fully carpeted floor. However, much may also be said in favor of the fully carpeted floor. Some people object to any bare floor, particularly when it is waxed, because of the danger of slipping. This, however, can easily be overcome by using, where traffic occurs, non-skid matting under small rugs. Many people think that wax makes the most desirable and lasting fioor finish for living rooms. The expense of this finish is somewhat more than a varnish finish because of the great amount of labor required. To keep a waxed floor in good condition it should be thoroughly cleaned at least once a year with turpentine or solvent and steel wool, 637 and then given two coats of highgrade floor wax. A soiled spot or stain may be removed from a waxfinished floor with turpentine or solvent, the spot treated, and the place covered anew with wax. With what should one cover the kitchen floor? Of all the kitchen floor coverings in use at the present time, linoleum seems to be the most satisfactory. A linoleum floor is resilient and easy to walk tipon. Inlaid linoleum is perhaps the most satisfactory kind. Good linoleum is about a quarter of an inch thick and inlaid on canvas. Inlaid linoleum has the pattern or color extending from the surface through to the burlap base. Printed linoleum has a pattern printed on the surface only, and constant washing soon obliterates the pattern. Linoleum may be kept in condition by waxing at frequent intervals. It may be washed with mild soap and water. The surface may be protected by a linoleum lacquer in place of, wax or varnish. Lacquer or varnish preserves the pattern of printed linoleum, but soon wears off in places that are most used, unless measures are taken to protect these spots. Linoleum with the pattern worn off may be painted and given an entirely new and fresh appearance. The manufacture of both linoleum and carpets is greatly cut down at the present time due to the war. The mills are weaving carpets on a monthly basis only. All dealers are on allotments, and the allotments are small. All-wool carpets are no longer made. All-cotton carpets and tugs, as well as those which are a mixture of cotton and woolsometimes cotton, wool, and rayonare now all that is being made. The various kinds of rugs and carpets which have been on the market until very recently are too numerous to discuss in this short lesson. One of the most satisfactory floor covering for living rooms, from the point of view of many decorators is broadloom carpet in a soft, dark, solid color. It must be remembered, however, in selecting rugs or carpeting that walls and floors are a background for other furnishings. Therefore, patterns and colors that "rise up and hit you"that is, startling colors and, in general, large designs are to be avoided. All rugs and carpets improve in glossiness and beauty under proper care. Cheap or expensive, they should be vacuum cleaned in the direction they were woven. Rugs should never be beaten or whipped. They should never be hung over a line. Small rugs should be brushed with a whisk broom in preference to sweeping them. Suggestions for Study 1. Make a visit to your carpet and linoleum dealer and procure linoleum samples and samples of carpets of different types of weave, material, etc. Discuss with the class the characteristics and qualities of each and give suggestions for the care of each. 2. Name several precautions to be taken in the care of large and small rugs. 3. What are the differences between paste, liquid, and self-polishing waxes, and where can each be used to the best advantage? 4. Distinguish between battleship, plain, jaspe and marbleized, inlaid, and printed linoleums.

I will show you oneyou find the other three. IT is realized that the business of housekeeping has not kept pace with the tremendous advancement in other lines of human endeavor, that the wonderful discoveries in science and the developments in the arts only slowly and partially have been applied to the problems of home life. However, enough has been applied to the home to make a study of modern housekeeping methods both interesting and profit Confucius. Able. In a short course, such as we are presenting in Relief Society, we cannot discuss all that is new and better in housekeeping methods, but it is hoped that enough information will be given to help class members with some of their housekeeping problems and to stimulate them to seek further for efficient ways of doing their household tasks. In wall coverings one has the choice of many materialspaint,  LESSON DEPARTMENT kalsomine, wallpapers of many kinds, grass cloth, etc. In deciding what covering to use, consideration must be given to beauty, service, and cost. In selecting a wall covering one must consider what is to be required of it. Is color that harmonizes with room furnishings of first importance, or is texture more important than color? Will the wall covering have to withstand a great deal of cleaning, or may it go for several years with only light dusting? Is the cost too great in proportion to the service the covering will render, or will its durability justify the cost? It is important also to decide how much labor will be involved in covering the walls, and whether or not the person to do the work understands the proper handling of his materials. A good paint job is in many respects preferable to any other type. Of wall finish. Although it is more costly than most other types, it is also more durable. Wall paints are both glossy and dull and, of course, have a wide range of color possibilities. The colors of good paints fade very little, so that a color well chosen may give pleasure for several years. Paint is used over plastered walls. Enamel paint is particularly costly as a material, requiring both time and skill to apply well. It usually produces a glossy surface not often desirable over an entire wall, except in kitchens and bathrooms where it is considered by many persons to be quite ideal. Instructions for the use of paints may be secured when they are purchased, however, surfaces should _always be clean, dry, and smooth. If the surface is covered with old paint, it should be sandpapered in order 639 to make it smooth. One should never paint over a surface that has been waxed without scrubbing off all the wax and without making sure the surface is dry. If any mending is needed it should be done before painting is started. Only new or well-cleaned brushes should be used, and they should be of a suitable width for the work to be done. Painted surfaces can be well cleaned by washing with mild soap and water or water softener and water. It has been found quite successful to apply a thin coat of cooked starch over a new paint job. This starch solution when dry leaves an invisible film over the surface which helps to make the washing job much easier. After painted walls have been once washed, the starch solution should again be applied to reduce hard work for the next cleaning period. Kalsomine as a wall finish is inexpensive. It is mixed with water, is comparatively quick to apply, and dries within two or three hours. It comes in a variety of colors and, though not as durable as paint is satisfactory on plastered walls where changes must be made frequently and where the cost of material is a consideration. Surprisingly good effects can be secured when kalsomine is well applied. Skilled workmen can so handle it as to produce almost any shade desired, and the surface obtained is dull with much the same texture as wallpaper. Frequently walls must be sized with a special sizing solution to obtain even results. Unfortunately, the colors of kalsomine fade in sunlight. Compared with paint, kem-tone, wallpaper, or canvassed walls, it is at the bottom of the list in cost. Kem-tone and similar products are new wall finishes which have recently come on the market. They are less expensive than paint, but more expensive than kalsomine. They come in paste form and have to be mixed with water. They have been very popular this past season and give beautiful results when properly applied. Instructions for their use are given on the container. Paper, as a wall covering, is so commonly used that infinite variety in color, texture, and durability has been developed. The price range is from a few cents per roll to several dollars. Wallpaper suitable in color and design for any room in a house may now be had. Small design in an allover pattern of much the same hue, but of slightly different values from that of the paper background gives a richness of texture without emphasizing design. Such papers can be successfully used in rooms where pictures are to be hung. Papers of large separate designs should be reserved for large wall areas not otherwise decorated. Wallpaper comes in washable and non-washable grades. Most wallpapers are best cleaned with the dough-type wallpaper cleaners now on the market everywhere. When propertly applied to the wall, canvas has the advantage of having rich texture and durability, but the initial cost is high as compared with most wallpapers. With restarching it can be freshened from time to time. Ceilings are usually light so as to give an impression of spaciousness. They should not be white except in white rooms, but should be keyed to the wall color in order to harmonize with it. 'The material used to cover the ceiling is usually the same as that used on the walls. If the room is too high, its height may be reduced in appearance by using a "dropped ceiling" or a darker shade of covering. If the ceiling is low, a striped paper, with stripes extending from base-board to ceiling, will make the ceiling appear higher than it is in reality. The woodwork is part of the background of any room, and should not be conspicuous in line or color. It may be stained, varnished or painted. Many commercial products are now on the market for cleaning woodwork, but mild soap and water will usually remove soil and spots with little or no injury to the finish. Questions for Discussion 1. What are some of the important factors to be considered in selecting the proper type of wall finish for a room? The proper kind of woodwork finish?. How does the locality in which you live affect your selection of wall coverings? How does it affect the cleaning problem? 3. Give some practical suggestions on how to properly clean painted walls with a minimum of effort; also painted woodwork. 4. Discuss some of the problems involved in covering one type of wall covering with another type; for example, kalsomine over wallpaper; wallpaper over paint; paint over kalsomine, Reference America's Housekeeping Book, Chapter 13, pp. 157-168  LESSON DEPARTMENT 641 Literature The Bible as Literature Lesson 4The Bible Ballad Tuesday, January 18, 1944 HEROIC days produce stories that are often transmitted through ballads down the ages. Lads may be briefly suggested by calling them story-songs. Tales of Robin Hood and His Merry Men are. Examples of this type of literature. In verse form, easily learned by heart, the popular stories of these Englishmen, who had taken to the greenwoods in protest against Norman tyranny, were "half said, half sung" as Scott puts it, and passed from generation to generation. In a lyric, a story is just suggested. In a ballad, the story is sketched. In a narrative, the story is told with detail. The ballad, in other words, is a story in essentials, given musicallyoften with "echo lines" to bind it more closely together. Generally, the ballad deals with but one dramatic incident. Rhythmic effects are usually distinctive, often striking. Ballads of the Robin Hood type are, of course,-not to be found in the Bible. Indeed, there are but few selections in Bible literature that may be classified as truly of the ballad type. One reason for this may perhaps be that Bible stories are usually almost as compressed as a ballad. Another, of course, is that Bible literature has its own distinguishing These balcharacteristics. In form, it does not parallel closely other literary forms. One of the examples that approaches the ballad type is found in Judges Five, Deborah's Song. A comparative study of this chapter with that of Chapter Four, helps one to get a clearer idea of the straight narrative story, and that of the ballad or song-story type. Back of these two chapters is of course the larger story leading up to the conquest of the Promised Land, and the distribution of the Tribes of Israel over their reclaimed realm. Joshua, you will remember, after crossing the Jordan, and after the triumph over Jericho, whose walls fall before his army, sweeps through the land of Canaan, defeating most of the tribes that have taken possession of it. Yet, despite the swiftness of his conquest, he fails to give heed to the Lord and sweep away the enemies of Israel "root and branch." This failure brings on a series of troubles. Round about the conquered realm are various peoples Midianites, Hittites, Philistines, and othersready to fight to get back the lands from which they have been driven. After the distributing ofthe Twelve Tribes over the various parts of Canaan allotted to them, there is 642 no central government from which they can be directed, especially in a military sense. A high priest is what may be called the chief ruler and he is concerned, it would seem, with administering spiritual matters. Enemies, taking advantage of this, begin to prey upon the tribes most vulnerable to attack. At the outset, the trouble comes mainly in the great plain of Esdraelon, an open country near the center of the land of Canaan. Gradually these attacks by the enemy are increased, until something has to be done to meet them. In Judges Four we are told the story in characteristic Biblical style, with straight, clear strokes and concreteness. It begins: And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord, when Ehud was dead. And the Lord sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles. And the children of Israel cried unto the Lord: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel. And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time. And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment. And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the Lord God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun? And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand. And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go. And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honor; for the Lord shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh. And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him. Thus the story continues to move forward step by step, telling of the defeat of Sisera and of his flight and death at the hand of the wife of Heber the Kenite. It is a straight prose narrative rising to a climax with the final victory over Jabin the king and his destruction by the Israelites. Naturally, at the conclusion of this triumph over an enemy who had enslaved them for a score of years, there would be an outburst of rejoicing. It comes in much the same spirit as that which followed the escape of the Israelites at the Red Sea, though in a somewhat different form. In Deborah's Song (Judges Five) we have the story sketched with bursts of music portraying various emotions as the triumph is depicted. Dr. Moulton in his Modern Reader's Bible, pp. 223-225, presents the Biblical ballad in part as follows: (See also The Bible Designed to be Read As Living Literature, by Ernest Bates, pp. 180-181.) Deborah's Song For that the leaders took the lead in Israel For that the people offered themselves willingly Bless ye the Lord! In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, In the days of Jael, The highways were unoccupied, And the travelers walked through byways; The rulers ceased in Israel, They ceased LESSON DEPARTMENT Until that I, Deborah, arose, That I arose a mother in Israel. They chose new gods; There was war in the gates: Was there a shield or spear seen Among forty thousand in Israel? Then the people of the Lord went down to the gates Awake, awake Deborah, Awake, awake, utter a song:  Arise, Barak, And lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam. The kings came and fought; Then fought the kings of Canaan, In Taanach by the waters of Megiddo: They took no gain of money! They fought from heaven, The stars in their courses fought against Sisera. The river Kishon swept them away, That ancient river, the river Kishon! Oh my soul, march on with strength! Then did the horsehoofs stamp By reason of the pransings The pransing of their strong ones. Following the above lines comes the rest of the story, telling of the death of the king, of the mother looking vainly for his return in triumph. Then with swift stroke the ballad ends with So let all thine enemies perish, O Lord: But let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. It is. Timely here to retell a story that came out of the reconquest of 643 the land 'of Palestine during World War I. During a battle with the Turks, a detachment of English lancers, it is said, made an attempt to charge the enemy across the '"'ancient river Kishon"named in the foregoing poem. Several of these horsemen went down in the quicksand of the river. When the leader was brought before the commander to report the disaster to his troops, he was asked, "Don't you ever read your Bible? It was this same old river that helped bring defeat to Sisera." Discussion and Activities 1. Explain the basic meaning of the term ballad. What rather old-fashioned song do you know that is ballad-like? Why? 2. So far as the story part goes, what is the essential difference between a lyric and a ballad? A ballad and a story? Illustrate. 3. Read all the story of Deborah as given in Judges Four. Then read the storysong as given in Judges Five. What is one basic difference that you observe between the two accounts of the same incident? 4. Find in Deborah's Song (Judges Five) some lines (two or three of them) that seem especially musical. 5. Choose from this Biblical ballad two or more words or phrases that bring a vivid picture to you. 6. Try reading parts of the ballad (Judges Five) aloud to note the vivid word pictures they bring.

Our nation is that one among all the nations of the earth which holds in its hands the fate of the coming years. We enjoy exceptional advantages, and we are menaced by exceptional dangers; and all signs indicate that we shall either fail greatly or succeed greatly.... We shall never be successful over the dangers that confront us; we shall never achieve true greatness, nor reach the lofty ideals which the founders and preservers of our mighty Federal Republic have set before us, unless we are Americans in heart and soul, in spirit and purpose.Theodore Roosevelt. E have tried to show in the preceding lessons of this course that the United States has republican or representative form of government, and that the sacred rights and privileges of it are common to all its people. Its grant of religious and civic liberty to all its citizens is one of the noblest gifts to mankind in history, and the truest thing that can be said of our Government is that only human beings of a high degree of mental and moral fitness can appreciate its gifts, for the more perfect people become, the less control by laws do they need. Our Government was grounded in religion, and though religion did not become a part of its political system, it was virtually incorporated into the feelings and lives of the people. This can easily be accounted for. The Christian sects of Europe found asylum in America before the Revolutionary War, and the Constitution of the United States provided for freedom to worship God as people wished. The American people have naturally been religious, and allied to their religious character is reverence for the Founding Fathers who dedicated their fortunes and pledged their sacred honor for the creation of the United States. When the first Continental Congress met in Carpenter's Hall in Philadelphia, September 5, 1774, delegates from all the Colonies, except, Georgia, had come to talk over their rights as Englishmen and to  LESSON DEPARTMENT make protests to the King of England because of grievances against the Government. This Congress led to the Second Continental Congress which issued to the world the Declaration of Independence. At the first session of the Congress, it was moved and seconded that the assembly be opened with prayer. While some objections were raised to the motion, it was finally carried and the Reverend Jacob Duche, Rector of Christ's Church in Philadelphia, was called in, and he opened the session with a fervent prayer. From that time to the present, every session of Congress has been opened by divine invocation, and the custom has become common in all the states when their legislative bodies meet. There is significance in the fact that the First Continental Congress was opened by prayer. It means that from the first our Government was dedicated to God, and the land consecrated to His holy purposes. 'They were select groups of Englishmen who settled these shores. Deep were their ideals of religion; holy was their concept of home life. They had as a rule been persecuted, but the people who go into a new country and have a long and perilous journey to make, develop unusual courage and determination, strong initiative, and strong convictions. As soon as the struggle for existence was over, the people began to assert themselves in new institutions. Town and county governments were developed, and these units of government were democratic, for the people met in meetings and made their own laws and appointed their own officers to enforce the laws made. Universal education was encouraged, and people 645 were free to work out their own destiny. Many new institutions were evolved, and women were freer than their sisters in the Old World. They occupied a more important place in society. Class distinction was abolished, and birth and money counted for nothing in redeeming the new country. A dominant individualism grew up, and ideals of equality, freedom of opportunity, and faith in the common man became deeply rooted in this New World. With the development of the country and the quest for the unknown, the people came to have a clearly defined conception of what "democracy" meant. All had a right to take part in government, both local and national. All had the right to vote for representatives to state and national legislative assemblies and for the men who should execute the laws. Citizenship in our country is a sacred opportunity and a power whereby homes, schools, churches, and civic life may be maintained for the best good of all. Citizenship requires the subordination of private interests to the public good. This naturally carries with it training in the great truth that man does not live for himself alone, but for the good of others. Good citizenship cannot exist without a deep love of home and country, for the state or city is not a mere corporation but a group of people who govern themselves, that they may have happiness and contentment. The state has a soul, and its essential greatness is its humanity. Good citizenship must conform to the political aims which we profess and to the political ideals which we cherish. In America we have what has always been called the "democratic feeling," this respect of man for man, a sense of justice that is not satisfied until justice shall be the cornerstone of our Government. Our traditions hold sacredly to the ideal that men must try to think right and do right according to the highest principles of Christian ethics. God had a directive purpose in the formation of this nation, and the spirit in which the Government was established is related to the Spirit of God. The terrible war going on today is a struggle for righteousness against wrong, a struggle to maintain the true democracy of mankind over tyranny and slavery. Behind all democratic government there is a firm conviction of the divinity of man, which expresses itself in just and equitable laws. There is a call of God to nations as well as to men to maintain the gift of freedom that is conducive to the growth of the spiritual life of people. Our units of government like the state, county, and city are units of culture which make for civilization, and "civilization" was clearly and nobly defined by the Lord Chief Justice Russel of England when he said: "Civilization is not dominion, wealth, material luxury; nay not even a great literature. Its true signs are thought for the poor and suffering, chivalrous regard and respect for women, the frank recognition of human brotherhood, irrespective of color or nation or religion; the narrowing of mere force as a governing factor in the world, the love of ordered freedom and abhorrence of what is mean and cruel and vile." The Latter-day Saints believe that to save the ideals of our democracy the people must have a stronger and more intelligent devotion to them. The Constitution of the United States gives us the democratic emphasis upon the value of life, and the right of the individual to attain unto the fullest development of his life. This has its origin in the religious and moral concepts of the Gospel which can supply democracy with an indispensable, fulfilling faith. Our Government with its Constitution is a tie that will bind the American people into a common brotherhood, and it will lead the way to other higher and spiritual unions. It blesses our efforts and it ennobles our lives. A few years ago, President Eliot of Harvard University made a statement well worth remembering. America, he said, has made five important contributions to civilization: first, we have done more than any other people to further peace keeping, and to substitute legal arbitration for the brute conflict of war; second, we have set a splendid example of the broadest religious toleration -even though Holland had first shown us how; third, we have made evident the wisdom of universal manhood suffrage; fourth, by our welcoming newcomers from all parts of the earth, we have proved that men belonging to a great variety of races are fit for political freedom; finally, we have succeeded in diffusing material well-being among the whole population to an extent without parallel in any other country of the world. These contributions to civilization are all of them the result of the practical side of the American character. The American people have retained the idealism and stability of character of their forefathers, and  LESSON DEPARTMENT they have a divine faith in their country, their Government, and in the people. The faith remains today, and for this reason there is a fineness to American character which will not allow America to become so seriously infected as to be destroyed by the false "isms" of Europe and other. Parts of the world. Americans are growing in religious feeling, for they are discovering that religion is the foundation of freedom and justice. It may be said today as it was said by a statesman over a hundred years ago: I see the dawn of a new and illustrious vision. I see the nation rising from its present depression with a chastened, but good spirit. I see education awakened, a spirit of sobriety ruling in work and in manners, a higher self-respect invigorating | our institutions, and the bonds of our government strengthened by a holier attachment. The building of this nation has been a long, solemn, and sacred task. It is the work of many generations of men and women who have conceived lofty ideals, and who, without regard to party, religious faith or section, "whether up in the pine 647 forests of Maine or over across the continent in the orange fields of California, or down on the plantations of the sunny South, have wrought for freedom, for liberty, for stability, for justice." The American people have in a singular sense regarded themselves as the instruments of Providence in the working out of a great Government and a mighty civilization. The sacredness of our citizenship will never be given up so long as we love freedom and culture, nobility and honesty, and so long as we have respect for one another and a deep and abiding faith in the Gospel of -the Lord Jesus Christ. Questions and Topics for Discussion 1. Discuss the principles of rghteousness that lie at the root of our Government. 2. Why do we hold the Constitution of our country as sacred?. 3. What is meant by the expression: "A government of the people?" 4. If you designate a man or woman as a good citizen, just what do you mean? 5.

Lesson 3Nephi, a Leader in the Land of Promise Tuesday, January 25, 1944 Note: For the full effect of this lesson it is imperative that the teacher and class have at hand the Book of Mormon. Lesson Objective: To show the rewards of righteousness. EPHI, the son of Lehi, was truly a great leader and a man of faith. Of him it can be said, he sought first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all things were added unto him (Matt. 6:33). He - had learned in the tender years of his youth to honor his parents, and therefore he found it not hard to believe the accounts his father told of visions received from God. This parental example of seeking out the Lord led Nephi also to desire a direct answer to his prayers, with the result that God revealed himself unto Nephi and explained to him the need for a Savior and the necessity of a plan of salvation. Other things too were made. Known to Nephi. He was told he should become a ruler and a teacher of his brethren, and that he would be given charge of the sacred records of his people. These records were to be of great importance in the latter days in convincing both Jew and Gentile of the mission of the Messiah. Concerning the establishment, by Nephi, of a new nation in a new world, we read: "And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did guide the ship, that we sailed again towards the promised land. And it came to pass that after we had sailed for the space of many days we did arrive at the promised land; and we went forth upon the land, and did pitch our tents; and we did call it the promised land. And it came to pass that we did begin to till the earth, and we began to plant seeds; yea, we did put all our seeds into the earth, which we had brought from the land of Jerusalem. And... They did grow exceedingly; wherefore, we were blessed in abundance. And it came to pass that we did find upon the land of promise, as we journeyed in the wilderness, that there were beasts in the forests of every kind, both the cow and the ox, and the ass and the horse, and the goat and the wild goat, and all manner of wild animals, which were for the use of men. And as we did find all manner of ore, both of gold, and of silver, and of copper" (I Nephi 18:22-25). At another period sometime later, when there had been a division of the original group who landed upon the shores of the New World, Nephi wrote of those over whom he had been called to preside: "And I did teach my people to build buildings, and to work in all manner of wood, and of iron, and of copper, and of brass, and of steel, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious ores, which were in great abundance. And I, Nephi, did build a temple; and I did construct it after the manner of the temple of Solomon save it were not built of so many precious things; for they were not to be found upon the land, wherefore, it could not be built like unto Solomon's temple. But the manner of the construction was like unto the temple of Solomon; and the workmanship thereof was exceeding fine. And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cause my people to be industrious, and to labor with their hands. And it came to pass that they would that I should be their king. But I, Nephi, was desirous that they should have no king; nevertheless, I did for them accord-  LESSON DEPARTMENT ing to that which was in my power" (II Nephi 5:15-18). But though great were his accomplishments as a leader among his people, probably the most significant thing to be remembered about this good man is his delight in the word of God, a delight which carried him actively into the accomplishment of great and significant things for mankind. He knew the value of searching the books of the prophets for the words of eternal life, having been close to these writings through the making of plates upon which the record of his people was engraved. '... For my soul delighteth," he says, "in the scriptures, and my heart pondereth them, and writeth them for the learning and profit of my children. Behold, my soul delighteth in the things of the Lord; and my heart pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and heard" (II Nephi 4:15-16). According to Nephi's own account, he had made two sets of plates paralleling the same period of history for his people. 'The first set, more secular in nature, dealt largely with the wars and contentions and destructions of his people. 'The second set, written by express commandment of the Lord, includes the writings of Nephi found in the Book of Mormon as we know it today. Nephi has this to say for the smaller or second set of plates: "And it came to pass that the Lord commanded me, wherefore I did make plates of ore that I might engraven upon them the record of my people. And upon the plates which I made I did engraven the record of my father, and also our journeyings in the wilderness, and the prophecies of my fa- 649 ther; and also many of mine own prophecies have I engraven upon them. And I knew not at the time when I made them that I should be commanded of the Lord to make these plates; wherefore, the record of my father, and the genealogy of his fathers, and the more part of all our proceedings in the wilderness are engraven upon those plates of which I have spoken; wherefore, the things which transpired before made these plates are, of a truth, more particularly made mention upon the first plates. And after I had made these plates by way of commandment, I, Nephi, received a commandment that the ministry and the prophecies, the more plain and precious parts of them, should be written upon these plates; and that the things which were written should be kept for the instruction of my people, who should possess the land, and also for other wise purposes, which purposes are known unto the Lord" (I Nephi 19:1-3). There is power in the direct and simple words of Nephi which comes from his knowledge of the truth. This prophet saw in vision the birth, death, and resurrection of the Christ hundreds of years before these events were to occur upon the earth, and his understanding of the marvelous gift of God in sending His Son is described in the language of the heart. If one wonders at the magnitude of Christ's atonement as it is written in the Bible, then let him tread Nephi's account of the mission of the Messiah. Herein is a most satisfying experience. Nephi's words concerning the coming of the Savior have, for one seeking the truth, that quiet persuasive power that is not unlike that given through the voice of a friend. Questions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggestive readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the passage given to discover plain and precious truths of the Gospel brought to light in the Book of Mormon. If time permits, have each member of the class add a passage of his own from within that part of the Book of \ Mormon (II Nephi, chapters 5 to 33) that gives Nephi's words concerning Christ to his peoplea passage that has brought new meaning to a Gospel truth. 1. Why is it hard to understand many of the great prophecies concerning the mission of Christ found in the Bible? Read II Nephi, chapter 25. The next question may be used if needed for class activity, or it may be assigned for home study: 2. In what condition will be the churches of the world in the latter days? How will new scripture be received? Read II Nephi, chapters 28, 29. L. D. S. Girls and Women in Wartime (Continued from page 606) The modern slogan that women are entitled to equal nghts and opportunities with men has led some women into fallacies of thought and practice that are very damaging 'to them and to the future welfare of mankind. In the first place, as to moral standards, equality of nghts and practices should mean that men should live up to the standards they expect of high-class women. To assume that women may indulge in the same practices that some men indulge in means that woman is simply degrading herself. From another point of view equality of rights does not mean absence of differences and duties any more than does the phrase, "all men are created free and equal." The facts are, of course, that in many respects they are unequal. So in many ways men and women are different and unequal. Each sex may be superior in some respects and inferior in other respects. The difference in biological structure and functions is self-evident. The differences psychologically and socially are not so visibly manifest but are nevertheless a fact. Men and women are complements of each other. The more fully and frankly this is recognized and the life of the family and of society organized and operated on this principle, the greater will be the success and the lasting happiness of both men and women. While it may not be the destiny of every woman to become a wife and mother, to live worthy of motherhood in the highest and most sacred meaning of the term is her proper destiny and road to enduring happiness. Women who have no children of their own can generally find opportunities to take a motherly interest in children of relatives, friends, and neighbors, and in this service find at least some of the satisfactions that go with successful motherhood. Any part in the creation or development of successful lives is one of the greatest contributions to religion.  in the Church Section of The Deseret News Teacher training lessons News from all stakes of the church Full page illustrated children's section Official church welfare news m, Since 1865  Many New Features!
