Lesson 7 Substitutes (For optional use on Tuesday, April 13, 1943)
UNDER present conditions, each week brings various changes and new problems which affect the daily living in every American home. With some commodities already rationed and many more in the offing, housewives, according to Government plans, will not only need to juggle their budgets but also their coupons for obtaining such commodities. However, the Government is rationing food not to make meal planning more difficult, but to make sure each oneservice man and woman, ally and civilian gets his share of the particular foods he needs. In order that each may have his proportion, sharing and careful planning, with the help of substitutes for the "must haves," are necessary. The word "substitutes" should be used advisedly, especially in reference to foods, particularly protein foods. Perhaps "alternate main dish" or "in place of" are more accurate expressions. The housewife needs to know, especially when using foods interchangeably, that all protein foods are not of the same value. Meat and other animal proteins contain the important amino acids or building stones needed to insure good quality, while the vegetable proteins are not complete alone but need to be used with protective foods to be well balanced. Besides protein of good quality, meat supplies thiamin, niacin, riboflavin, iron and flavor. Fish, poultry, milk, cheese, eggs, dried peas and beans, soybeans, nuts, variety and glandular meats, can be used in many combinations as the main dish. Meat need not be entirely substituted, but extended by the use of other food, such as rice, noodles, dumplings, potatoes and other vegetables. Leftovers can be used in stews, croquettes, hash, souffls, or in sauce served on waffles or biscuits. Casserole dishes are convenient to use in extending the flavor of meat, fish, or vegetables. Meat goes further when cooked at a moderately low, even temperature. While soybeans have been used as food, though not extensively, they are now frequently used in combination with other foods. The meat industry is experimenting with a meat and soy sausage which will stretch the supply of sausage meat. Millers are working on combinations of white and soy flour, testing them in breakfast cereals. Soybeans are used to furnish oil in soap and paint and to make plastics. Now they furnish a possible source for a new fibre that is warm and feels like wool. The rationing of sugar so far has not been a real hardship, and there are substitutes that can take the place of sugar without lessening the food value; however, the recipes calling for sugar must be adjusted when substitutes are used. A Government bulletin says that when syrups and maple products are substituted for sugar, their differences must be kept in mind. Sorghum, molasses, and cane syrup are less sweet than maple sugar, honey, or sugar itself, and one and one-half times as much of them is required to obtain the same degree of sweetness. Corn syrup is even less sweet and twice as much corn syrup as sugar is required to obtain an equal degree of sweetness. In addition, it must be remembered that syrups add water as well as their own characteristic flavor to the food. Honey or corn syrup may be substituted for one-half the sugar in putting up fruit without affecting the delicate flavor of the fruit. Honey, when available, may replace one-half the sugar in jellies, jams, preserves, or marmalades. Corn syrup may replace one-half the sugar in preserves, but only one-quarter in jellies and jams. Slightly longer cooking is required to get the same consistency as when sugar is used alone. For baking, some substitutions that have been worked out are: For 1 cup granulated sugar use: molasses1 cup with  ts. Soda; reduce liquid requirements of recipe  to ? amount. Honey1 cup with  ts. Soda; reduce liquid requirements of recipe  to ? amount. Maple, maple-cane, or corn syrup1 cup and  cup sugar; reduce the liquid same as above. Brown or maple sugar1 cup firmly packed. These amounts will vary a little according to the density of the materials. The flavor and color of the finished product will also vary according to whether light or dark ingredients are used. Foods containing honey have a tendency to brown more quickly than do those containing other sweetenings, so the temperature for baking may be slightly reduced. A combination of molasses or honey with sugar (half and half) produces results most nearly like that obtained from the use of all sugar. After the sugar has been taken from the sugar cane, chemists are using the residue of the sugar cane to make a substitute for the wax used in floor waxes and varnishes. Many other useful materials and substitutes are being made through means of chemistry. When nylon is again available for civilian use, there will no doubt be many new developments, and nylon will be blended with other fibres to make substitutes for many fabrics now in use. If, and when, liquid milk is rationed, tomato and fruit juices may be used in the place of milk to make biscuits, cake, gingerbread, and cook-
ies. Vegetable juices heated slowly, served in cups with a slice of lemon or other tart fruit can be used occasionally in place of cocoa, or made into sauces to serve with spaghetti or noodles. Averaged figures show that butter contains two and one-half times as much Vitamin A as does fortified margarine, often used as a butter substitute, but that margarine costs half as much. Every homemaker, however, is eager to get good quality nourishment as well as quantity for the money spent. While we are all concerned with substitutes for many of the foods we have been in the habit of using, our vital concern is to find substitutes that will maintain health and good nutrition. Many such substitute foods are available. New sources of cloth for clothes may be milk, peanuts, fish, protein, glass and bark of trees. Milkweed, a nuisance plant in some places, is going to work for the navy, and the floss will be used as a substitute for kapok in life preservers and rubber boats. If it proves substantial, it may be used in place of wool. Surveys show that clay, one of the oldest raw materials, is plentiful; hence, many products such as sewer pipe, dinner ware, pottery, hospital supplies and earthenware cooking utensils, are being made of clay for civilian and military needs. Plywood is being used for springs in upholstered chairs. Reports say that where plywood is used furniture is not as plump as the conventional overstuffed kind, but it is quite comfortable and good looking. Civilian products using steel, copper, or aluminum are due for further drastic cuts

in production, and unless the makers of less essential commodities can substitute such materials as wood-fibre or glass for essential metals, the Government will no doubt entirely stop the production of such commodities. Many household articles made of wood, glass, or plastic, such as cooking utensils, salad bowls, lamps, etc., are now on the market. As yet there seems to be no substitute for metal wire used in egg-beaters, strainers, sieves, etc., so the housewife should take good care of these utensils to make them last for the duration. The few canned foods and other products that are released to civilians in the future will have a different dress. Containers will be of electrolytic tinplate which is not tin at all, but a specially prepared steel plate. Then specially baked enamels will be used to protect the food against discoloration, and to safeguard against rusting of the can. Many dried foods and other articles will come in paper and pasteboard cartons. Buttons regarded as brass and pearl are not what they seem, but are made of zinc with brass and enamel coating and of inexpensive plastic. The latter versatile material allows for many bright colors which are very decorative. Whatever changes may come, the American woman can and will meet them. Rationing and substitutes may be a nuisance, but will no doubt have a salutary effect on many household budgets. Out of all this may emerge a nation of intelligent consumersconsumers who will have learned, through necessity, to live within their incomes.
