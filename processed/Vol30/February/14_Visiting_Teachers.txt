Lesson 8 The Spirit of The Good Neighbor as An Expression of Faith (Tuesday, May 4, 1943)
TO be a good neighbor is to obey the highest commandment given to man by our Lord and Savior. It is to love others as ourselves. If this high ideal were practiced, it would establish the Kingdom of Heaven on earth. Our neighbors, in the broadest sense, include all mankind. We are all the children of our Heavenly Father, and He loves each one of us. The spirit of the good neighbor leads all those who possess it not only to desire the same good for all others that they wish for themselves, but to strive to make that good a reality. The Apostle Paul gives us the characteristics of this spirit of love. They are patience, forbearance, longsuffering, kindness, generosity, courtesy, humility, unselfishness, good temper, thinking well of others, and love of truth. In a revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord said: And now, verily, I say unto thee, put your trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do goodyea, to do justly, to walk humbly, to judge righteously; and this is my Spirit. (Doctrine and Covenants 11:12) And He further states that,... I will impart unto you of my Spirit, which shall enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soul with joy; Speaking to the Relief Society, on March 28, 1842, the Prophet Joseph Smith said:... Let your hearts expand, let them be enlarged towards others; you must be long-suffering, and bear with the faults and errors of mankind. The spirit of the good neighbor is a practical ideal. There are numberless daily occasions where its teachings can be applied. There are always with us those who need real kindness. There are plenty of opportunities for generosity, unselfishness, good temper, and courtesy. This spirit can extend beyond personal relationships to the community. We can strive to obtain for every child, for example, what we wish for our own. Our public school system is an expression of this spirit. Every child should have educational opportunities, health opportunities, a normal home, and those things which make for its greatest physical, mental, moral, and spiritual development. As Mary E. Richmond once said, We should not only care for the unfortunate one who was robbed and beaten on the road from Jericho to Jerusalem, but we should clear the road of thieves and robbers and make of it a safe place for women and children to travel. To do good to all men, whoever they may be, is one of the funda-
mental principles of the Gospel, and is the real spirit of the good neighbor.
