The Road Builder Rita Skousen Miller
When next you look at a beautiful highway, well built, or a vigorous life well lived, think of the builderhis dreams, his labors, and his joy.
THE initials were still there all right. Large and calloused middle-aged hands pulled away some weather-beaten bark, and kind, faded, blue eyes strained to make out the faint, stained letters that he already knew, "W D L," William Dean Lanyon I. Tall pines rose all about him and mountainous growth almost enclosed this little spot. At only one point could he look out and up to the piercing blue sky fringed with reaching pines and down to the rugged canyon and rocky mountainside. There he stood at this moment. It was here beside the great tree that that other Lanyon had stood those many years ago and made his mark upon its trunk. It had been just about this time of yearwhen the worst storms were due and one could feel them coming in the air. The train of saints from Missouri had been anxious to get over the mountain pass and into the Valley. Big Bill Lanyon, the two Minter boys, and three others had spent four days forcing a trail for the covered wagons through the thick underbrush in the bottom of the canyon. Early storms had already covered the trail blazed by the first group of saints through the other pass, and this was their only chance to make the Valley this year. As the signal had gone through for the wagons to start into the canyon, Big Bill Lanyon hadn't gone back but had pulled his horse to the left. After a few yards up the side of the mountain, Big Bill had dismounted and pulled his way slowly up through the timber until he had reached this spot, high and remote and quiet. Then he had thrilled as he suddenly faced the great expanse of bright blue sky with its background of distant threatening clouds against the rough, rugged mountain. As he had looked down he could see the tiny wagons as they labored slowly into view. The low roll of the train and sound of moving cattle came faintly up to him. And the Minter boys were singing again. How the Lord had blessed them! None had known the real tragedy of their situation when the storms to the north had cut them off. All would know when they reached their destination that the Lord had directed them through this pass in time. They had built a good road! Triumphantly it wound and clung to the side of the mountains on the floor of the canyon, and Big Bill's pride excited him as he looked at the thing they had made. With their teams they had fought the big boulders in their way. In fact, the whole journey had been extremely tedious and difficult. Jim Narden was still unable to rise from his wagon and the two little Leland girls were getting worse. There were others. But at last they were nearing their destination! At that moment Big Bill's

heart swelled within him in gratitude and there so high above that little moving caravan, for one fleeting moment, he felt close to the heavens. Then he had carved his initials in the trunk of the great tree and with another look had turned and made his way down the steep slope.
EIGHT years later, Big Bill had come back to the great tree with his young son. They had struggled happily up the mountain together and Little Bill had clung to his father's hand as they suddenly came upon the lookout and all that it held. Big Bill had pointed out the dusty road far below. How proud he had been! "To be a road builder, my son," he had said, "is a great task. We must have roadsroads to make life a little easier for our friends and loved ones. Roads to help us accomplish the great responsibilities ahead for us here in this Valleyroads to create a great nation and a great people." Little Bill had listened as he looked at the narrow ribbon. A wagon had appeared and then disappeared again in a film of billowing dust. "You see, son, learn to create things that people can use and enjoy." Then after awhile father and son had laughed and eaten a little lunch under the great tree, and Big Bill had told stories until the sun had set behind the great mountain. William Dean Lanyon I was gone now but here was another Big Bill, a Big Bill that remembered a day spent on this spot many years ago. And the initials were still there. Not as clear by any means but still there, like the words that had been spoken that day. Big Bill looked down into the still rugged canyon. There it wasfinished at last. Its wide expanse wound triumphantly around the mountainside like a beautiful, smooth, satin ribbon. This Big Bill, too, had battled the mountain, blasting solid rock day after day to make way for the steam shovels and trucks. Gradually, great crags and boulders and the loose, touchy mountainside had been first broken, then supported, and then subdued, until now a magnificent highway layquiet and ready and something he had made, but not alone. Beneath the perfect, smooth surface lay a rough little road created with teams and hand picks and another's dreams. Big Bill had not forgotten, nor would he. At the remembrance the scene grew misty, and in his imagination he could almost hear the low rumble of wagon wheels; but then he looked again, coming into view was a train of huge trucks, earth-green United States Army trucks and they carried supplies. The procession was perfect and orderly. Curling Yes, we must have roadsroads to keep a great nation and a great people, roads to make life possible for our friends and loved ones, roads to help us accomplish the great responsibilities ahead of us here in this nation. Then Bill thought of his four sonshappily. They were building roads, beautiful, brilliant ones. One was building his in the sky, another in the sphere of government, another on the sea, another in the mission field. How the Lord had blessed

him! His heart swelled in gratitude and high above the floor of the canyon for one fleeting moment Big Bill felt close to the heavens. Even as he had used the trail, oh might his sons use this lovely almost living thing far below him, and all that he and the Church had taught them to

build a greater way to a better world and a kinder one! Large and calloused middle-aged hands pulled away some of the weather-beaten bark and this very day, if you can find the spot and look closely, you will see the initials of two great men carved together. When next you look at a beautiful highway, well built, or a vigorous life well lived, think of the builderhis dreams, his labors and his joy.
