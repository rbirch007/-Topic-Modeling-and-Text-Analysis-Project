A. No. It is recommended that persons pay respect only when the National Anthem is played by a band, orchestra or other musical instrument actually in the room. However, Colonel James A. Moss (deceased), who was head of the United States Flag Association and who was recognized throughout the nation as an authority on flag etiquette, has several answers to the question of what one should do when "The Star Spangled Banner" is heard over the radio. He says, "It depends on circumstances. Generally speaking if it seems natural and not forced to stand and uncover, it should be done; otherwise, it should not. For example,' if eating at table, lying in bed, or working in the kitchen, standing at attention would be forced and unnatural." The office of the National 119 Americanism Commission  believes that when the National Anthem is played over a radio or in a restaurant from a "juke box" or some other type of musical reproduction machine, or in a theater over a film tract, here again it would seem more or less forced and unnatural to pay respect.

At the words "to the Flag," the right hand is extended, palm upward, toward the Flag, and this position is held until the end, when the hand, after the words, "Justice for all," drops to the side. However, civilian adults will always show full respect to the Flag, when the pledge is being given, by merely standing at attention, men removing the headdress. Persons in uniform should render the right hand salute. Q. Can the Flag be washed or drycleaned? A. Yes; it is permissible to wash or dry-clean the Flag. Q.
