The Cover GEORGE WASHINGTON
THE cover picture for this issue of the Magazine is a reproduction of a portrait by Gilbert Stuart. The following interesting description of the physical appearance of George Washington was written by a friend, George Mercer, in 1760.
"As straight as an Indian, measuring six feet two inches in his stockings and weighing 175 pounds.... His frame is padded with well-developed muscles, indicating great strength. His bones and joints are large.... He is wide shouldered,... Is neat waisted, but is broad across the hips, and has rather long arms and legs. His head is well shaped though not large, but is gracefully poised on a superb neck. A large and straight rather than a prominent nose; blue-gray penetrating eyes, which are widely separated, and overhung by a heavy brow. His face is long rather than broad, with high, round cheek bones, and terminates in a good firm chin. He has a clear though rather a colorless pale skin, which burns with the sun. A pleasing, benevolent, though a commanding countenance, dark brown hair, which he wears in a cue. His mouth is large and generally firmly closed.... His features are regular and placid, with all the muscles of his face under perfect control, though flexible and expressive of deep feeling when moved by emotion. In conversation he looks you full in the face, is deliberate, deferential, and engaging. His voice is agreeable rather than strong. His demeanor at all times composed and dignified. His movements and gestures are graceful, his walk majestic, and he is a splendid horseman."
