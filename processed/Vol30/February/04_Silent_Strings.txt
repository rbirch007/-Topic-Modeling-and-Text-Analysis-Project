Silent Strings Blanche Kendall McKey Second Prize, Relief Society Short Story Contest
WITH more certainty than she had ever felt before, on that late July afternoon, Sheila admitted to herself that she was old. It wasn't because she felt weak or defeated, judging herself as an actor in the life she had led. Rather, it was the realization that she had never been truly herself, and now it was too late. For sixty years she had heard the song of the untouched West with its inscrutable mountains, but she had never tried to sing or paint or write it. She had not used what was finest within her; in fact, she had never been an artist at all. And now she was old. The young Sheila she had beenwith her perky red curls and quizzical blue eyesseemed to stand literally before her faded gaze. She shook herself and crossed to the mirror over her dresser, pressing calloused palms to her creased cheeks, noting the grooves in her forehead and neck. Wind and the open plains had made her fair skin as dry as parchment. Studying the swollen veins of her hands, she saw youthful, tapering fingers reach across the strings of her aunt's harp in Dublin, her aunt who had been a celebrated musician and whose harp Sheila was to have inherited when she became eighteen. But when that birthday had arrived, she had looked across the scorched fields of Zion, to which her parents had fled ten years before, and thought of tapestries and a stately harp whose strings were silent, now that her aunt was dead.

"I should have done better," thought Sheila bitterly; "I let little things crowd it all out." She thought of the garden, the children, the endless housework, and of her mother's long illness. "Why did I have such a heritage?" she asked. Then she looked at the picture of Colleen on her table and once more made a solemn resolution: Little Colleen, with the harp of Dublin hidden in her bosom, was going to have a chance to sing. "Are you ready, Aunt Sheila?" It was Elsie's warm voice calling from the kitchen, and thoughts of youth and unfulfilled longings fled. "Yes, I'm ready, my dear," Sheila replied; and tying a white scarf over her thinning gray hair she went out to the shady front porch. The poplars were casting thin shadows across the patch of lawn; the wide stretch of fields was still. Suddenly, from some unseen spot, came the clear call of a meadow lark. Gerald, Elsie's husband, was taking good care of the farm now that John was gone! The front door of the small house beyond the garden opened and John's sister Maggie appeared. She followed slowly the narrow path between the two homes and climbed the steps of the larger dwelling with jerky effort. "Maggie is old," thought Sheila"really old." Elsie came out, crisp and cool in her blue organdy. "Gerald said the rehearsal went fine last night," she said with enthusiasm. "He thinks the pageant's going to be great." "Weel, they'll hae to do some fancy acting if they come up to Sheila'sand that a lang time ago," replied Maggie dryly. Sheila made a gesture of remonstrance, but she looked pleased. "Young folks must have their day, Maggie. And don't you forget that Colleen is going to sing tonight." She squeezed her handbag tight against her breast, for it held Colleen's stirring little note: "I must see you tomorrow, Grandma! I must! I have something important to tell you." Something important! Could it be an offer? Why, Colleen had had only a year of real training. Maggie was describing to patient Elsie the wonders of Sheila's performance in Hazel Kirk. "There, there," cried Sheila with pretended petulance, "let the past be!" But Maggie was bubbling with reminiscences. "Your Uncle John was over-proud of her, Elsie," she said ruefully. "He was sae proud that I sulked. It's nae pleasant for a sister to be shoved aside by a weebit wife." The laugh that had risen in Maggie's throat broke off and ended in a sigh. Both old women thought of John sleeping beside his first wife, the gentle English girl who had not survived the rigors. After a pause Maggie's thin voice rose again. "Your Uncle John was nae the mon to let a bit o' stubborn land get the best o' him, Elsie. He dug out rocks to build his house and brought water down from the mountain for his fields."

"Uncle John was a thrifty man," corroborated Elsie. "Aye," said Maggie, "and masterful. He had Ireland in his household, but he meant to hold his ain." She screwed her wrinkled face until it gave a distorted impression of roguishness, cast a challenging glance at her sister-in-law, and waited for a sharp retort. But Sheila seemed to be unconscious of the prattle. Elsie noted her melancholy detachment with rising apprehension. Old people were so moody and hard to understand! When they should be gay they sank into the depths. "Come, now, Aunt Sheila," she pleaded. "Tomorrow's the Twenty-fourth! They're putting on this pageant for people like you. Think of all you've done for the town." Her eyes swept the stretches of corn, wheat and alfalfa, the tops of farmhouses in the valley, the paved road which led to the recreation hall where the pageant was to be given. "No one has done more good than you have, Aunt Sheila." Sheila would have liked to talk to the sympathetic Elsie if she had thought the younger woman could understand. In her unhappy condemnation of what she had done with her talents she felt the need of love. That was why Maggie's praise had sounded so sweet. She would gladly have confessed that she felt herself to be a flat failure but for a deep-sunk timidity. Elsie was young and didn't know enough, whereas Maggie was old and knew too much. So she threw them both a Mona Lisa smile and hugged tight the thought of Colleen. Elsie plucked playfully at her aunt's sleeve and shook her bobbed head as though she were still a girl. "No one can go on acting and singing forever," she tactlessly comforted. Sheila smiled again, her glance unlighted; then her lids fell as she caught the significance of Maggie's canny remark: "She's not greetin' for the songs she can sing nae more; she's greetin' for the songs she niver hae sung." Good heavens! Was there nothing that the heart could hide? Such piercing seemed almost immodest. With an effort she lifted her gaze to find Maggie smiling at her fondly. After all Maggie loved her. She felt a painful little clutch at her

throat. Then she let her great eyes rest illuminatingly on her sister-in-law's face, fell in with the family dialect and said amicably, "Aye, lass." Elsie ran down the steps impatiently, looking up the road. "Gerald should have been here with the car twenty minutes ago," she exclaimed. "Something has held him upprops, I suppose. It will spoil the whole evening if we have to rush in at the last minute." HALF-HOUR later, seated comfortably in the front row of the balcony which afforded the best view of the stage and so had been reserved for honored guests, Sheila attempted to subdue her rising excitement. Was Colleen nearly ready? Would she have a moment to slip upstairs before the performance? Suddenly she heard a quick step coming down the aisle, and almost before she could turn she heard Colleen's whisper. "Move over, Grandma. I only stay a second." Sheila shuffled. Into the seat reserved for the president of the Relief Society and Colleen slipped down beside her. "Look, Grandma!" 'Timidly she thrust out her hand on which shone the loveliest diamond the old lady  had ever seen. She lifted her eyes to study the girl's face. "It had just come when I wrote the note yesterday. Bob and I are going to be married." "Bob?" wavered Sheila. "Bob Brownell. Surely you tremember Bob." Sheila hadn't thought of Bob Brownell in a long time. With an effort she recalled an apple-cheeked bo "He s been away to medical school, you know, for nearly four years." Colleen's voice trembled a little. She glanced at twotiny wings pinned over her heart. "Bob and I saw a good deal of each other when I was at school last winter." Her hand pressed the small insignia. "Now he's in the Air Corps." Can  SILENT STRINGS Sheila felt a throbbing in her own breast. Little Colleen's hero was offering his life for his country! In a moment the tremulous voice came again. "['m not going back to the Conservatory in the fall, Grandma. I'm going to make bullets. II've got to help." Sheila saw the glisten of heavy tears and felt empty herself. She knew that Colleen wanted to speak further, but couldn't. "Tt's all right, dearest," she whispered close to the wet cheek. "T could never have gone to the Conservatory at all if it hadn't been for your money. And you didn't have any too much yourself. I know that. And you expected so much of me." "It's all right; honestly, it's all right." But Colleen was struggling to make a clearer explanation. "II have to helphelp Bob and the Red Cross and the farmers and everything that means America. You pioneers built such a wonderful country. We wouldn't be worth the dust of the plains if we couldn't protect it. I can't just study music not this year." And Sheila could only reiterate that everything was all right. After Colleen had hurried away, leaving perfume and remembrance of youth behind her, Sheila was doubly thankful that some of Maggie's old cronies had carried her off to sit with them. Absent-mindedly ~ she heard their laughter rise above the babble of talk around her. The balcony became crowded and boys began placing chairs in the aisles on the floor below. The small orchestra 91 filed in. Smiling, the Relief Society president took her seat beside Sheila and became absorbed in her officers sitting on her right. Sheila was grateful beyond expression to be let alone. Little Colleen and her shining diamond! Her courage and faith in America! It was queer the way life surged along. She thought of her years with John. If he had been able to love her as he had loved the wife of his early youth, would that have lessened her sense of unfulfillment? She thought of all she and Maggie and John had given to the land before it had begun to yield. She recalled her mother's privation, felt her horror of famine, and sat as though gripped in the silence of death. And as an accompaniment to the pageant of her mind, she heard the plaintive throbbing of the harp she had renounced. Sheila was so deeply stirred before the curtains parted that the ensuing scenes shook her to her depths. The portrayal of the long trek; handcarts inching through sand; weary voices singing, "And if we die before our journey's through" She scarcely knew what was her own dream, what was acting, and what was reality. Then with a little shock she was conscious of Colleen standing all alone on the dim stage at the foot of a covered wagon. Her auburn hair was demurely parted and arched by a small black bonnet. Her tiny waist was compressed into an unyielding basque. Her skirt, fluted and puffed here and there, fell to the floor. Plain white collars and cuffs softened the severity. Then, without accompaniment, her clear tones filled the hall: O my Father, Thou that dwellest In that high and glorious place, When shall I regain Thy presence, And again behold Thy face? Throughout the four verses she held the audience motionless; she was part of the sleeping encampment, part of the covered wagon, part of the endless plains, and of the still, unresponsive night. And all at once Sheila knew, with the true intuition of a born artist, that her people were too close to their struggles, too young in culture for a great expression. But some day a man or woman would look over the fertile fields of Utah and Idaho and see the land as it was primevally, ringing with the whoop of the Indian, the beat of the buffalo, and the shrill cry of the mountain lion. Or he would look at the imperial mountains and interpret with brush or pen their awful aloofness. It wouldn't be her heart strings aquiver, nor was it likely to be Colleen's. But some day it would come, for a great movement demands a great reproduction, and the message of her hills and plains had never been fitly expressed. And when the painting or play or novel came, her tears would be in it, and her yearning, for she and her parents and John and their friends had made a great work possible. But little Colleen, like Sheila herself, could sing the song of Zion "in a strange land." 'Tears on the girl's rounded cheeks: Then at length, when I've completed All you sent me forth to do   Sheila's questioning eyes were lifted and for a moment she sat breathless. "O God," her heart whispered, "the redemption of man! After all, wasn't that the song of Zion?" She knew that this was true, and knew also that the brush of Michelangelo, the imagination of Milton, and the pealing of an organ in a great cathedral could only suggest the beauty of a soul returned to God. With unconscious dignity shielded by the darkness, Sheila bowed her head. In a moment of realization she was paid for what the years had taken from her. She felt hot drops falling upon her folded hands, but the stabbing regret was gone. SHADOWS Roberta Bates Twilight and the shadows of the stars Fall soft and deep Into the stillness of a murmuring sea; So soon my shadow will have fallen Fallen deep Into the quiet darkness of eternity.  George D. Pyper Milton Bennion Superintendent of the Deseret Sunday School Union, passed away January 16, 1943. Funeral services were held in the Assembly Hall on Temple Square, in Salt Lake City, on January 19. All members of the First Presidency, the majority of the General Authorities, the Sunday School Union Board, and a host of friends and admirers of Superintendent Pyper were in attendance. Brother Pyper had been an xecutive officer of the Sunday School Union Board for more than forty years. He had also served the Church, the state, and the local community in many other capacities. He was endowed with very superior artistic abilities but his artistic interests and attainments in nowise curtailed his business and administrative abilities. This was manifested in his long and successful term, as manager of the Salt Lake Theatre and in his management of numerous pageants, musical and dramatic performances, and publications, many of which he either wrote or edited. (Guaeen D. PYPER, General In his youth and early manhood he served as clerk and later as judge of the Salt Lake City police court. This experience induced him to study law. These studies were, however, interrupted by a call to an extensive missionary tour in the company of Elders B. H. Roberts and Melvin J. Ballard. Numerous subsequent calls by both Church and state to important positions prevented Brother Pyper from resuming his legal studies. ELDER GEORGE D. PYPER To his intimate associates he was best known as a courteous, kind, sympathetic, and understanding friend; he was, indeed, a friend of man. While he was deeply religious, there was in him no trace of the pharisaical attitude so frequently denounced by Jesus. While he attended to all the details of the precepts of the Church, he emphasized the "weightier matters of the law"  justice, kindness, and integrity. His character was, in fact, the embodiment of these virtues. He had ever in mind the greatest of all the commandmentsthe love of God; this he expressed in the love and service of his fellow men. When they were in trouble they came to him for assistance with assurance that this assistance would be given to the limit of his ability. Page 93 To Marry or Not to Marry in Time of War Dr. Harold T. Christensen Brigham Young University MILLIONS of young men and women are asking themselves this question today. In the midst of the uncertainties and the fears of total war, they are wondering what to do about marriage, and for the most part they are confused. The problem is not an easy one and young people are not the only ones who are confused. The many decisions surrounding marriage are difficult enough in normal times, but these difficulties are multiplied and magnified enormously in times of war. War is a crisis in the family institution; patterns of life are changed so fundamentally that courtship and marriage as usual, is simply out of the question. It is hazardous to advise in times like these, for the chance element is great and no one understands very well what the immediate future holds. But hazardous or not, it is important, so that in planning for the future we can be guided by knowledge and understanding as far as is possible rather than by impetuous feelings of recklessness and desperation. The spirit of this article is that of analysis and suggestion rather than preachment or dogmatic pronouncement. 'There is no one formula that will fit all cases and answer all questions regarding war marriage; the decision to marry or not to marry is after all an individual matter depending upon the personal values and external circumstances Page 94 involved in each case. But the decision should nevertheless be an intelligent one, based upon serious thought and a consideration of the factors involved. Our purpose is not to decide the question of war marriage once and for all, but to present some facts and arguments which may aid each person in making his own decision. The Impact of War The repercussions of modern war are felt throughout the entirety of society; no single phase of our social structure, including the relationships of man to woman, escapes. In understanding the problem of marriage in wartime it might be helpful to review briefly some of the effects of the present war upon the family institution: (1) In the first place, marriage, divorce, and birth rates have been greatly accelerated, although it is reasonably certain that this acceleration will be temporary only. Marriages have increased for a number of reasons, running all the way from a desire to escape the draft to either an increased emotionalism brought on by the war, or to a realization that it may be "now or never." Because of recent military regulations, marriage for draft evasion is not as common as it was earlier. Undoubtedly many marriages do take place today, however, due to war hysteria in one form or another. The atmosphere of war is charged with emotionalism; the glamour of the uniform, plus a love for adventure and a feeling of uncertainty in the future, all tend to increase irrational behavior, such as rushing into marriage without adequate thought or preparation. Furthermore, with millions of our boys in the armed services, some of them never to return, there is often the feeling that unless one can marry now he may never have the opportunity later, and hence the tendency to "grasp at straws" in near desperation. It is well known that many women never married following World War I because there were not enough men left to go around (there were more than four million surplus women in the marriageable ages in Germany, France, and England alone), and it is realized that a similar condition will follow this war. In gambling with the future many young men are making sure of the marriage experience before they die, and many young women are saying that if worst comes to worst they would rather be a widow than a spinster anyway. The birthrate has increased as the natural accompaniment of the expanded marriage rate, plus a conscious motivation in some instances, such as draft evasion, the desire on the part of the husband to leave a progeny in case of death, or on the part of the wife to have something to remember her husband by. The divorce rate has increased very likely because more people have more money to finance the divorce proceedings, and also because changes necessitated by the war effort often create family tensions. With millions of men armed services for in the considerable the period of war. Lengths of time, we can logically expect marriage, divorce, and birth rates to fall rapidly in the very near future and to remain low throughout Likewise, with the return of many of these men after the war, it is reasonable to expect a new increase in all of these rates before they again settle down to a somewhat normal level. This was the experience of World War I, and we can expect it again. (2) A second change brought about by the present war is the loosening of moral standards and the lowering of moral conduct. Unfortunately, the rigors and the brutalities of war tend to dull the finer sensitivities of men and, with some at least, to sever the ties binding them to a strict moral course. The normal sex ratio is disturbed in war, placing both males and females of marriageable ages in abnormal environments. 'The male in service is removed from the stabilizing influence of those he knows best and loves, and at the same time is thrown into situations not the most wholesome. The female at home finds courtship competition more difficult because of the shortage of men, and will often lower her standards in order to more successfully compete. And coupled with all this is the hysteria of war mentioned above. Service men are frequently made to feel that loose conduct is expected of them, and girls that it is patriotic to cater to the man in uniform. Many are blindly and selfishly indulging excessively in worldly pleasures on the sad theory that they must have their fun while they can. "Eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow we may die," they are saying, and as a result TO MARRY OR NOT TO MARRY IN TIME OF WAR 95 morals are given a holiday. It is to avoid temptations such as these that some choose to marry. (3) Another effect of war, and the last that will be discussed here, is the weakening of family bonds and the' consequent growth of family instability. Military life tends to unfit the man for home life after the war; separation of husband and wife for long periods during the war permits misunderstandings and infidelities to creep in, leading toward greater maladjustment later; and when the wife works, she gains a new individualism and financial independence that she may not be willing to yield after the war. The growth of nurseries for the care of children belonging to working mothers, is one noticeable indication of declining family functions in the wartime.
The Pros and Cons of Marriage
No one will argue that all marriages should stop in wartime, and likewise no thinking person will justify all of the marriages that take place under the stimulation of war. Marriage is too important an institution to be sidetracked, even for total war; the future of society demands that it have a position of priority. But marriage in time of war is not only continued, but it is expanded and often perverted as well; hasty unions, ill-planned and artificially lived, are in many cases doomed for failure. The question, then, is not, "Should there be marriage in wartime?" but rather, "Who should marry and when?" And the question is a debatable one. As we have already said, there is no one answer that will fit all cases; each person will need to weigh all factors that are involved in his or her particular case, including personal feelings, but not allowing these alone to sway his judgment; and then with his eyes open he should make his own decision taking his chances with the uncertainties of the day. When such notables as Lewis Browne and David Seabury disagree on the advisability of marriage in wartime, it is evident that the problem is a tough one and that the arguments are not all on one side.* Those who favor war marriages usually do so on the grounds that, even though these carry more risks than do marriages in times of peace, risky marriage is better than no marriage at all. It isn't quite fair, they argue, to expect a young person who has planned his future in terms of family life to forego all of this without a try. Thousands, possibly millions, of young men will never return from the battle front, and, through waiting, an equal number of young women will be left without partners in marriage. Why not enjoy the marriage experience before going away to war, they say, thereby insuring the consummation of love although necessarily gambling on the continuance of the marriage state. In addition to this they point out that marriage tends to stabilize those who enter, giving each something to live for, work for, and die for, if necessary. Contentment and clean living during separation are said to result from the assurance that somewhere there is a husband or wife who cares. Opposed to these arguments are those which make war marriage look

like a very risky business. While happy marriage is certainly better than no marriage at all, it is said, unhappy marriage is not, and the probability of unhappiness in war marriages is great. Heightened romanticism and feelings of desperation brought on by the hysteria of war both tend to make marriage a hasty and impetuous affair. In times past girls have asked all sorts of questions concerning their prospective husbands; questions such as, "What family does he come from?" and "How well educated is he?" but now altogether too many are simply saying, "Where is he?" During war neither boys nor girls are as discriminate in choosing a mate as in other times, and they are usually in a bigger hurry to have the marriage performed. All of this means insufficient acquaintance and inadequate preparation for marriage, which in turn means greater marriage failure. Furthermore, long periods of separation between husband and wife, separations which usually follow a hasty wedding and an all too brief married experience, are not conducive to successful marriage adjustment. Worry, misunderstandings, suspicions, and temptations all enter in to frustrate the separated spouses and to make the durability of their union less likely. If neither death nor desertion prevents a reunion of mates following the war there are other casualties that may prove just as bad. If the husband returns home maimed or diseased in some way, for example, the prospect facing a young wife in becoming the caretaker of an invalid for an indefinite future is not a happy one, particularly if the spouses were practically strangers when they married, had little time to get acquainted and become adjusted immediately following marriage, and have grown farther apart through long separations and contradictory experiences. Then too, the dangers regarding infidelity and the cooling or changing of affections toward each other must not be forgotten. Entering marriage impetuously, without preparation, and without the opportunity of normal home life together, make a rather poor combination of circumstances to insure marital happiness, it is argued. And in support of this contention one need only consider the great increase in the divorce rate following every important war.
Factors in Making the Decision
With these arguments in view, and with a knowledge of his own personality traits, feelings, and desires, each young person will make up his own mind as to whether he will marry or not in wartime. But it is hoped that in each case the problem will be intelligently and prayerfully considered before the decision is made, so that the possible consequences of the alternative procedures will be thoughtfully realized and courageously faced. In the spirit of self-analysis the following questions should be asked: (1) Are you well prepared for marriage with each other? If the desire to marry is prompted largely by the war emergency so that you won't "miss out on anything" it is likely that your motives are more those of desperation than of love and companionship. Studies show that marriage is more likely to be successful where the couple has been acquainted for a number of years and has been engaged for a long enough time to adjust and to prepare for what is to come. Unless you have been fairly well acquainted over a considerable length of time, be just a little wary of your motives and also those of your sweetheart. It may be that you are mistaking reckless emotionalism, or military glamour, or mere desperation, for the "real thing." Haste makes for waste even in the marriage game; and it is far better to think first so that "repentence at leisure" will not be necessary. But if you are ready for marriage, and if this readiness has been tested by both time and thought, you may consider it best to accept the hazards of war without letting them change your marital plans. (2) How long will you be able to live together after marriage before the war separates you? The start of any marriage is the most crucial from the standpoint of mutual adjustment in laying foundations for harmonious living, and unless husband and wife can be together for a reasonable period after marriage and under somewhat favorable circumstances they are starting under a handicap. But because of military policy you may not know exactly how long you can be together. In such circumstances the best you can do it to take a chance and do what seems best after other factors are considered. But certainly where you know that you can be together for only a few days, or even a few weeks, you will realize the handicap. Sometimes the wife is permitted to live close to the military camp where her husband is in service, and in this way be with him occasionally. This is often the best solution possible, but even at best it is frequently none too good. High rents, crowded living conditions, frequent movings, and infrequent visits together put them both under strain and make home life difficult if not impossible. (3) Will you be able to finance the marriage? Poverty and economic insecurity are drains on anyone's happiness, even in marriage. This is an important question at any time; but since economic uncertainties are greater in wartime, it becomes all the more important then. With the husband in military service will the wife have adequate financial support? In the event of a child will there be enough to care for them both? (4) Are you willing to accept the inconveniences and the risks involved? If wives are true to their husbands during separation in wartime they will find themselves either staying home or going out without partners, and husbands will similarly find their social life limited. Can you "take it"? Can you be separated and yet maintain the morality and the fidelity required in holy wedlock? Are you strong enough and brave enough to accept the casualties of war should they come to you or yours, and to readjust to whatever the war may leave you? Unless you are mature emotionally, and are brave, the hazards of marriage in wartime may be too great for you. These are serious questions, but they are important for those who are thinking of marriage in this day. Many thousands of the war marriages taking place now are doomed for failure because of the haste and impetuous emotionalism that is bringing them about. But on the other hand, a great many of today's marriages will be happy ones because they were preceded by the thoughtful and prayerful preparation that is ever important, whether in time of war or of peace. By multiplying the uncertainties of the future, war does make marriage more of a risk but it certainly does not preclude the possibility of success. Nonmarriage is better than marriage failure, and if the hazards of war make failure seem imminent in any particular case then that marriage should not be performed. But marriage need not fail, not even in wartime, if preparation has been complete enough and the persons involved are big enough to do their part. That is the answer. Latter-day Saints will let the doctrine of eternal marriage help them solve this all important question. Marriage in wartime should be considered with all the seriousness of purpose as in peacetime, and preparation may be considered as incomplete if the couple is not ready for a temple ceremony. Not even total war justifies a marriage of convenience.
