IMPORTANT NOTICE TO ALL SUBSCRIBERS
DURING the past several months each issue of The Relief Society Magazine has been late, due principally to conditions incident to the war. Every effort has been made, both by the General Board and the press, to get the Magazine back on schedule. It has now been decided, after careful consideration of all aspects of the problem, that the only sure means of accomplishing this is to combine two issues of the Magazine. For this reason, the June and July numbers have been combined in one larger issue which is only slightly smaller than the two separate issues would have been. We are sure our subscribers will feel that the advantages of receiving the Magazine near the first of the month for which it is issued will more than offset the loss of the few pages occasioned by the combination of the June and July numbers. Unless new complications arise, subscribers may be assured of receiving all future numbers of the Magazine near the beginning of the month for which it is dated.
The Cover
SEA GULLS ATOP THE SEA GULL MONUMENT
THE cover on the June-July Magazine is used to honor the Mormon pioneers, the first company of whom, under the leadership of President Brigham Young, entered Salt Lake Valley, July 24, 1847. The cover is a reproduction of the ball and two sea gulls atop the Sea Gull Monument by Mahonri Young, which stands on Temple Square in Salt Lake City. This monument was erected in 1913 and "stands as a reminder and lesson to all of the children of the State of the preservation at God's hand of the grain which was to insure food for the pioneers of 1847." The ball on the monument is made of granite and the sea gulls are of bronze covered with gold leaf. It is interesting to note the part which sea gulls have played during recent months in providing food for members of our armed forces adrift at sea, notably in the Rickenbacker incident. Photo by H. Perry Driggs; cover arrangements are by Evan Jensen.
