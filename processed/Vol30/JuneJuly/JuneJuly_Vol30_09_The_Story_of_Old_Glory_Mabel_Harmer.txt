The Story of Old Glory Mabel Harmer ECAUSE it is the symbol of home, country, liberty, and all else that we hold most dear, "Old. Glory" commands our sincerest reverence, claims our deepest love, and inspires our greatest acts of courage. Nations have unfurled their flags since the beginnings of recorded history, and legions have followed their ensigns to greater deeds of courage and valor. "Terrible as an army with banners," said King Solomon over three thousand years ago. The Star-spangled Banner has a diversified and fascinating history and it is particularly fitting at this time, when the flag is so prominent in our national spotlight, that we learn more of its history. Many flags, both of this and other nations, flew over this land before the stars and stripes, as we know it today, was finally adopted. Columbus unfurled the colorful banner of Spain when he landed on the island of San Salvador in 1492. The orange, white, and blue flag of the Dutch Republic flew over the colony of New Netherland for fifty years, until an English fleet replaced it in 1664 with the cross of St. George and gave the colony the name of New York. In 1535, Jacques Cartier sailed up the St. Lawrence and formally claimed its entire valley in the name of the King of France. When James of Scotland succeeded Queen Elizabeth on the English throne, he created the Union flag by - uniting the red cross of St. George on its field of white with the white cross of Scotland's St. Andrew on Page 386 its field of blue, and it was this flag that waved over the struggling colonies of Jamestown and Plymouth. Not only was it the first flag to fly over the homes of English-speaking people in America, but its colors of red, white, and blue lived on to become the permanent colors of the flag of the United States. It was the Union flag that led Washington's struggling army of Virginians to battle at Fort Necessity in 1754, it waved above the successful colonists in the defeat of Braddock, and it replaced the flag of France at Detroit in 1760. Although the Union flag was the chief standard of the American colonists for a great many years, they soon began to create individual flags expressive of their particular localities and interests. Among the best known of these was the pine tree flag of Massachusetts, which towards the close of the colonial period became known as the "Liberty Tree" and bore the legend "An Appeal to Heaven." Another symbol which was employed in a variety of design in New England was the rattlesnake flag with the warning words, "Don't Tread On Me." New York fashioned a flag with a black beaver on a white background, and Rhode Island's white flag had the word "Hope" above a blue anchor. There was no common standard furled over the heads of the fighting colonists when the fires of the Revolutionary War flared into full blaze. As one historian says, "The only common flag the Colonists had was the one they were fighting against," THE STORY OF OLD GLORY but among the many banners that floated over the various companies were a number that could easily have been forerunners in design for our present stars and stripes. Among these was the flag of the Philadelphia Light Horse Troop which escorted General Washington to New York to assume command of the army and which bore in its center a knot tied with thirteen cords flanked by thirteen blue and silver stripes. The first flag to be generally adopted by the united colonists was known as the Grand Union flag and was flown from a seventy-six-foot flagstaff on Prospect Hill in Somerville, Massachusetts, on January 1, 1776. It is not known who designed the flag but, oddly enough, it contained the Union Jack of the mother country in the canton together with the thirteen red and white stripes still used in our national banner. It continued in use until nearly a year after the signing of the Declaration of Independence when it was superseded by the stars and stripes. ITH the signing of the Declaration of Independence, all allegiance to Britain was broken and the symbolic crosses of the Grand Union flag became obsolete. Nevertheless, Congress was painstakingly slow in proceeding to create a new flag. It was not until June 14, 1777 that Congress, convened at Philadelphia, in the midst of numerous items of petty business passed the simple resolution, ".... That the flag of the United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the Union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.". Thus without fanfare 387 or ostentation the stars and stripes was born. Just as the Great Union flag had been created by the simple procedure of adding six white stripes to the field of England's flag, the new national banner was made by substituting the thirteen white stars on a field of blue for the crosses of St. George and St. Andrew. In this manner the union of the thirteen colonies was doubly portrayed, both by the stars and the stripes. 'There was no definite design provided at this time, and the matter of what proportions the field should be, or how the stars should be arranged was left entirely up to the fancy of the seamstresses who fashioned the various flags. Dr. M. M. Quaife in his book The Flag of the United States says, "We seek in vain for any recorded explanation of this cavalier procedure but it seems obvious that the reverence which all Americans today pay to their flag was foreign to the minds of the men of 1777. A flag was essential to the conduct of warfare between ships at sea, and the Congress met the need by prescribing in general terms the new design. It is obvious that their actions were animated by the practical need and but slightly, if at all, by sentiment for the new banner; nor need we wonder at this, for in the beginning it was not hallowed by the associations and the sacrifices of more than a century and a half which all present-day Americans instinctively associate with it." Congress in adopting the emblem had assumed that there would be only thirteen permanent states. Rapid expansion to the west and south soon brought about a national change 388 of mind in this regard, however, and in 1781 Congress adopted a resolution pledging that new states would be admitted to the Union enjoying equal privileges with the original ones. Vermont and Kentucky were already well settled and when they became the 14th and isth states of the Union, it was soon apparent that something had to be done about the flag. In 1793 a resolution was presented to Congress suggesting that the flag be changed to contain fifteen stars and fifteen stripes and the Senate nonchalantly passed the bill; but the House arose in indignant debate and one member "thought it a trifling business which ought not to engross the attention of the House when it was their duty to discuss matters of infinitely greater importance." He said, "If we are to alter the flag from thirteen to fifteen stripes with two additionel stars because Vermont and Kentucky have been added, we may go on add-. Ing and altering at this rate for one. Hundred years to come. It is likely that before fifteen years shall elapse we Shall consist of 20 states. The flag ought to be permanent." After considerable _ bickering wherein the members of the House freely expressed themselves that the bill was not worth all the trouble and waste of time it was causing, they passed the bill, in order to get rid of it; and thus the second flag of the United States became one of fifteen ted and white stripes. - It was our national banner for nearly a quarter of a century, led our soldiers through three wars, and flew over Fort McHenry on the night of September 13-14, 1814 when Francis Scott Key-JULY 1943 watched through the rockets' red glare to learn the fate of the Starspangled Banner. This lack of regard for or even interest in the flag can be understood when it is remembered that as yet we were not a strong nation bound by ties of loyalty and tradition. We were but a group of struggling and loosely-bound states far more concerned about individual governments than about the nation as a whole. In the same manner our national anthem attracted but little interest when it first appeared in print, and it was not until the time of the Civil War that it began to attain its present place in the affection of the American people. After the war of 1812 there was a considerable improvement in the unity of feeling existing between the states and a tremendous upsurge in our sense of national pride. By 1816 there were five additional states in the Union but no provisions had been made for displaying this increase in the commonwealth upon the flag. The matter was brought up in Congress by Peter H. Wendover and it was largely due to his persistent efforts, over a period of two years, that a permanent design for the flag was finally adopted. Members of Congress argued that it was impractical to add additional | stripes for each new state and that the number should be reverted back to the original thirteen stars and stripes. As everyone knows, a compromise was finally effected, in 1818, whereby the number of stripes was placed at thirteen for the original colonies while a new star was added for each new state until forty-eight (Continued on page 392)
