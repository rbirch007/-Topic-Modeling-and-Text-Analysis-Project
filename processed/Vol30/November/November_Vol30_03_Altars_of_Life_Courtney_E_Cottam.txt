ALTARS OF LIFE Courtney E. Cottam Each life erects an altar for its soul, And kneels to worship as the spirit needs,; Its psalm a call of triumph or despair, Faith-bom, knowing that God always heeds. In supplication, then, I humbly bow, Asking for faith to meet this hour's doubt, For courage to withstand the torrent's might, Unbended by the raging winds without. Prayer's answer is unveiled within the heart; True courage lies in humble things done right; Each day, then, let us walk our way in faith That God will lead us into glorious light. PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT REACHES ANOTHER MILESTONE 655
