AUTUMN SUNSET Grace Zenor Pratt From the steep summit of the winding roadway I look again at Juarez far below, Serenely guarded by her sheltering mountains Gilded and glorified by sunset's mellow glow; The red, the gold, the flame of scarlet maples.... Autumn has glorified the fertile valley there Green distant fields and there a singing streamlet, While peace lies over all like solemn prayer. The brooding hills are mauve and blue like sapphire, That ring about the valley's jeweled worth; I sometimes feel when looking down on Juarez There is no lovelier place on all this earth.
