Moral and Religious Integrity Elder Milton Bennion General Superintendent of the Deseret Sunday School Union rity, these Jesus called the weightier matters of the law. They are fundamental virtues in both civic and religious life. The Latter-day Saints in pioneer days acquired wide reputation for business integrity. To be identified with the Church was better security than stocks and bonds. Some current bankers' codes of ethics state that a borrower's character is more important than his collateral security. Probably most business men would agree to this in principle, if not in practice. We may well ask ourselves, is membership in the Church now a guarantee of business integrity? Unfortunately, it is not always so; even court records reveal some damaging evidence. The craze to get rich quick and by easy rather than by earned methods is largely responsible for this slump from industry and honesty. The desire to excel in making a show of luxury and fashion is also an important cause of dishonest practices leading to misappropriation of institutional and public funds or to inexcusable bankruptcy. "Plain living and high thinking" supported by industry, physical or mental or both, is the most certain method of forestalling these departures from the standard of integrity properly expected of all Latter-day Saints. This, however, is only one phase of integrity. Other phases are of no Page 664 less importance. Integrity applies also to fulfillment of all one's moral and religious obligations, living up to one's professions. A Latter-day Saint presumably has accepted the Restored Gospel with all its standards of individual and social living. There are those who pride themselves on strict conformity to outward observance of some of these standards, involving practices that may be seen of men, or shown on the Church records, and assume by this that they are thorough Latter-day Saints. How do they stand on the first and second great commandments? 'They may think they stand very well on the first, but what conception have they of the spiritual qualities of God? Do they give any thought to this question? If so, is He conceived in terms of their own human weaknesses, as do many primitive peoples, or do they attribute to Him the highest virtues of which man can conceive and much beyond? Does their professed love of God include love of these virtues, and sincere effort to realize them in their own lives? "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." Unless love of God results in striving to realize this ideal, it is but a pretense and a very wide departure from the principle of integrity. As professed religion it is in the same class as that manifested by some of the scribes and Pharisees so severely denounced by Jesus as hypocrites MORAL AND RELIGIOUS INTEGRITY and worse than ordinary sinners. The sin of hypocrisy is the antithesis of religion. Without sincerity profession of religion is a mockery, and worse than making no profession of religion at all. What of the second great commandment? Do the Pharisees of our time really love their fellowmen as they love themselves, or do they seek first and foremost their own advantage with little concern for the welfare of their fellows? When confronted with the suffering of fellowmen do they seek in all sincerity and diligence to relieve this suffering, or do they wrap about them their cloak of assumed righteousness and "pass by on the other side" as did the priest and the Levite in the story of the good Samaritan? In the history of religions it often happens that the initial enthusiasm under the leadership of a great proph- 665 et tends to slump, and the adherents of a religion forget the great ideals and purposes of their religion. 'They either ignore these ideals and set about enriching themselves and impoverishing other people, as did some of the rulers of ancient Israel and Judah, or they do as did the scribes and Pharisees, concentrate on outward observance of some of the details of the law, confusing means with ends, replacing spiritual attitudes and motives with mere outward conformity, and forgetting altogether the greater commandments upon which all others are founded. Jesus said "... Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees..." We may well say to ourselves, "Beware lest we seek to rise by this same kind of leaven." There is danger that it may leaven the whole lump. Let us maintain our religious integrity. _RADIO SERIES Commencing Sunday, October 10, Elder Aloert E. Bowen of the Council of the Twelve began a new series of radio talks entitled: "Constancy in a Changing World" over the Church Sunday Evening HourKSL, 9:15 p.m. We think that this series will be of such general interest, and of such value to members of the Church, that Relief Society members are encouraged to listen wherever they are in a position to do so.
