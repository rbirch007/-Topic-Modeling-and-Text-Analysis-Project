WHEREVER PINE TREES GROW Martha Lu Tucker Wherever pine trees grow I feel at home. Wherever pine cones fall And needles pad a path Beside a small, determined stream That's dashed from heights Upon rough rocks To draw its spray-bent body to itself And make its way among the boulders That obstruct its bed, Yet murmurs as it goes Wherever hoarse crows call And song birds sing Beneath the lazy, drifting clouds,  Where flowers add their perfume To the snow-cooled breeze Wherever pine trees grow I feel at home.
