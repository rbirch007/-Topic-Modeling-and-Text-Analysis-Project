Courage Is the Word for It Mildred Steelman WHEN Margaret stood on the station platform with Stephen and Bill, the numb feeling which had possessed her for days melted away. All the past hectic week she had made plans and decisions, but they had seemed to be for someone else, not for Margaret Jamison and her husband and her son. The salty taste of tears made her swallow. It was no longer just any officer who was going overseas. It was her husband. "Take care of your mother, Bill," Stephen was saying, and his voice had a deep huskiness that Margaret had seldom heard in it. But his words made her upper lip curve into a little crooked smile. "I will. Dad," she heard Bill say. She hadn't realized how tall he was getting, almost as tall as his father. They were shaking hands like two men. Then Stephen had her in his arms. "God watch between me and thee," he said. Margaret hid her face against his chest. Stephen held her close. "Oh Stephen," she said, "Stephen," but she smiled into his eyes. Then the train was under way and he was waving from the vestibule, a tall man with a kindly face and gold oak leaves on his shoulders. Margaret waved frantically and knew that Bill was waving, too. At last she felt the quick pressure of his hand on her arm. "Let's go. Mom," he said jerkily. "Fm hungry." But she read concern for her in his eyes. If only he didn't have to go back to Seattle tonight, but he musn't miss any more time at the university. She was going up there herself in a few days, just as soon as she could wind things up here. Last fall she had leased their home in Seattle in order to be near Stephen. It was wonderful that the tenants were leaving, that she could have the house back. The train was out of sight now, and for the first time she realized that the station was full of people who had come, as she and Bill had come, to say goodbye to their soldier. Instinctively she put her hand up to see that her hat was in place. It was a little red hat and there was charm in the way she wore it. Candor and strength of purpose were in her hazel eyes. "All right. Bill," she said, "like to drive?" "O. K.," Bill said, and then, "Jeepers, there's Sally Sue Crandall, Julia's little sister. Hi, Sally." "Hello," she called. "Wait Bill," and Margaret saw her running toward them, her brown curls blowing back from her face. She was out of breath when she reached them. "Oh," she said to Bill, "I thought you were alone." Bill laughed down at her. "Mother, this is Sally Sue," he said. "I'm glad to meet you, dear," Page  Margaret said. Pretty as a picture, she thought, and about thirteen. "Got any business to be here?" Bill asked, "because if you haven't-" "You needn't be a meanie," Sally Sue pouted. "Cora had to drive down to Olympia on business and I came along. Cora is my stepmother," she explained to Margaret, then her face crinkled into a smile. "It was dreary waiting at the hotel, but it's fun to watch a troop train leave." "That so?" Bill said, his voice deep in his throat. "Gosh, Bill, you've been seeing your dad off." Sally Sue's brown eyes filled with tears, "I'm sorry." She's sweet, Margaret thought, and that's all the more reason why she ought to be spanked for hanging around a station. "O. K., Kid," Bill said, "we'll drop you off at your hotel." "Well, all right, but don't you dare tell Cora or Julia." "Not this time, but if ever again?" Margaret looked into their serious faces and her throat ached. It didn't seem long since Bill was Sally Sue's age and there were always a lot of things for which he needed to be scolded. And now he was growing up. But she crowded that thought down. At least he had been deferred to continue his engineering course. In the car Sally Sue chatted gaily with an occasional, "Don't you think so, Mrs. Jamison?" But Margaret was thinking about Sally Sue's sister. Surely it was just a girl and boy friendship between Julia and Bill. A couple of university kids. The Crandalls lived across the street from Bill's fraternity house. "Brown study. Mother?" Bill asked after he had let Sally out. Margaret nodded. At least the child had made her think of someone besides Stephen. Her breath came unevenly. "Let's get the trunks down before you leave," she said. I'll pack half the night, she told herself. I won't let myself think about Stephen. Jyr ARGARET hung the last curtain and stepped back to survey her living room with its deep-toned rug and baby grand piano. "I don't know any one who can give a room the air of home-like luxury that you ? can," Stephen had once said. "Don't forget I'm a home economics graduate. It's the artistic eye, plus plenty of polish and wax," she had laughed" not realizing how much of the latter it took until she had to apply it herself after a busy morning at the Red Cross office. Not that she minded. She wanted to be working hard to be too tired every night to think. A shadow fell across the doorway. "Hello, Mom," a plaintive voice said, "got a handout?" Margaret's eyes lit. She supposed Bill would always have the power to make her smile. He wasn't exactly good looking, but no one could call him homely either. Margaret loved the lean lankiness of him and the little gleam of humor in his eye. "There are honey cookies in the old jar," she said. "Gosh, Mom, it's swell to be back home." "yYou don't miss the fraternity house too much then?" "I'm there plenty as it is. COURAGE IS THE WORD FOR IT 357 A fellow likes to know he's got a home,? Bill said, sitting down at the telephone. One would think he hadn't seen Julia all day, Margaret thought. Momentarily a frown crossed her brow. She must get better acquainted with Julia. "How about my asking Julia to dinner tomorrow night?" she asked when Bill hung up. "Swell." Bill draped his long legs over the back of the sofa only to sit up again a little awkwardly. "I don't know how to say it but you and Julia have just got to like each other." Margaret's face flushed crimson. "I like Julia/ she said. "Are you trying to say that she doesn't like me?" "Of course not. It's just that when you've got a swell mother and a swell girl, you want?" Margaret felt a little prickly sensation at the back of her neck. Maybe she ought to talk to Julia. The kids musn't get too serious. They were so young. She'd talk to Bill, too, but not tonight. "You can have Julia over all you want to now I have the house in order," she said instead. "You know me. I like to have someone to keep house for/' Bill got to his feet, put his arm about her. "No letter yet?" he asked. "No letter," she said, her voice unsteady. Stephen had been gone a month. It was hard not knowing, not being able to picture him in some particular place. ??# "I didn't invite you to dinner to ask embarrassing questions, but when Bill was delayed it seemed a good chance for a chat." Margaret smiled at the young girl seated opposite her in the little room they called the study. "I know you didn't," Julia said, and stopped. I have upset Julia, Margaret thought, and I didn't mean to. She had brought her in here because the close intimacy of the little room made it seem a place for confidences. The slanting rays of the sun caressed the red geraniums in the window, and made a pool of light at Julia's feet. "Forgive me," Margaret said, and because she couldn't quite help it, "You are beautiful, dear." Julia caught her breath on a half sob. "I'm not going to pretend that I don't love Bill," she said, "because I do. And," she added after a minute, "he loves me. That's what you want to talk about, isn't it?" Margaret bit her lip. Julia was refreshingly frank. She wondered whether it was the modern girl or just Julia. She was so sweetly serious yet full of fire and zip, sitting there in the big, blue chair. Her feet barely touched the floor, yet Margaret didn't think of her as little. Her face had the exquisite contour of a cameo, and her fine eyes were looking straight into Margaret's. "It's because you are both so young, Julia dear," Margaret heard herself say. "Bill and I don't want to be married for a long time." Julia's smile was wistful. "I'd hoped you liked me just a little," she said, "because I adore you. The lump came back into Margaret's throat. "The girls have a stepmother,? Bill had said. "She was an actress before she married their dad. They call her Cora. I think she's been more of a mother to Sally Sue than to Julia. If it hadn't been for her little sister, Julia would have been plenty lonesome at home since her father died." ?Thank you, dear." Margaret smiled at Julia. Bill was sensible really. He and Julia would be all right. There was Bill now. She loved the way he tossed those two unruly curls of his back on his forehead. "Hello, Julia, hello. Mother," he was saying. "Any mail?" "A letter from your dad," Margaret said. "He's in the Philippines." Bill's eyes kindled. "Gosh! That's where I'd like to be. Where's the letter?" Margaret walked over to her desk, picked up the letter, put it down again. Stephen's first letter. She wanted to read it privately to Bill. "I wish you knew my dad," Bill was saying. "He's a darn swell guy. Never lets a fellow down." The sincerity in Bill's voice clutched at Margaret's heart. "Here's the letter, dear," she said. "I'll go finish up the dinner." She must get over feeling that Julia was an outsider. For her own sake and Bill's and Julia's, too, she must admit her into the inner sanctum of their home. ONCE you let the barriers down there is no putting them up again, Margaret realized as the weeks passed. She didn't want to be selfish, yet she would have liked to have had Bill to herself once in a while, at least. Just because he had been deferred was no reason he would continue to be. Nearly all his friends had gone already. But she crowded down the nagging worry. She didn't know just how long she would have Bill. She never let her thoughts go farther than that. They'll get tired of each other before long at this rate, she told herself one afternoon when Bill insisted on Julia's going down on the avenue with him to get his shoes shined. "I can always get mine done, too," Julia called over her shoulder. Margaret sat down on a low stool beside the radio. She felt her nails pressing into her palms and deliberately folded her hands in her lap. She musn't be like that. Suddenly the music was over and a news analyst came on the air. "The manpower problem in the army is serious," he said. "Many deferments will not be renewed." Margaret felt the tears welling up behind her eyelids. What about Bill? It was time for his name to come before the draft board again. Maybe this time-She was crying when the door opened and Sally Sue burst in. "Hello, Mrs. Jamison," she called, "is Julie here? No one answered so I-" "Oh," she said, when she saw Margaret, "I'm sorry. Cora says I'm always butting in where I have no business." Margaret dabbed at her eyes with the tight little ball that was her handkerchief. "You musn't mind an old woman's tears, dear," she said, but her voice shook. Sally Sue stamped her foot. COURAGE IS THE WORD FOR IT 359 "You're not old. You're young and pretty. Why don't you go on crying?" She blushed furiously. ?I mean, don't mind me. I'll go away. Oh, here come Julia and Bill now." 'There was too much of a line up so we didn't wait.? Julia said. Margaret glanced at her quickly. Why that casual tone? She and Bill hadn't quarreled had they? Julia's face was flushed, her eyes too bright. Bill's, too. "Oh hello, Sally," Julia was saying. 'Is anything the matter at home?" "Of course there isn't. I mean why should there be? Say, Julie, can I wear your white dress?" "Why, I don't know," Julia said doubtfully. "Where are you go-ing?" "Oh, please, Julia, I have to," Sally pleaded. "It's going to be a swell dance. I've got to knock their eyes out." "Whose eyes?" Bill laughed. Sally Sue looked at him pityingly. "It's the Explorers. We are having a party at Mutual." She threw her arms around Julia's neck. "Please Julie," she said. Margaret swallowed hard. Sally's chatter was giving her a chance to get hold of herself. "Well, I suppose you can," Julia answered. "When is the dance?" "A week from next Friday." "Sort of forehanded aren't you?" Bill teased. But Sally Sue wasn't listening. "Oh, thank you, Julie," she beamed. "I'll do something for you sometime." She turned to Margaret. "Goodbye," she said. Margaret looked from Julia to Bill when the door closed after Sally Sue. "What happened while you were gone?" she asked, and in spite of herself her voice trembled. Bill shot a startied look at Julia. "We stopped at the post office," he said, and pulled a long, official-looking envelope out of his pocket. "Oh, Bill, your draft summons!" For a moment the room reeled. Then it had four walls and a ceiling again, and Margaret heard what Bill was saying. "Oh, Mom." There was exultation in his voice. "Jeepers! I can't tell you how I feel. I've got to help. I've wanted to all. Along." Margaret put her hand up to her throat. She had had no idea. It didn't seem possible that Bill wanted to go. She looked at them and tried to overcome the sick feeling at the pit of her stomach. They were both so young and fine. So generous. Bill put one arm around her and one around Julia and it seemed to Margaret that he had grown an inch in the last few minutes. "I've got to take it in my stride," she told herself, and rubbed her hand against Bill's cheek. "I'm glad you feel the way you do," she said aloud. But no amount of remembering that she was a soldier's wife could reconcile Margaret to Bill's being in the army. She poured out her heart in a long letter to Stephen and then didn't send it. I musn't try to put my feelings into words, she thought. It isn't fair to Stephen. Instead she got out a V form. She couldn't say much on that, but it would be enough. In the days that followed, she could only think how young Bill was, how sheltered. How little responsibility he had ever been expected to take. It's a man's army. she told herself, and Bill is just a kid. ?They won't coddle me in the army.? Bill said gruffly one night. Margaret swallowed her tears. She must curb that longing to put her arms around Bill whenever he came home. "Gosh, Mom, don't take it so hard," Bill was saying, ?I'm not a kid. Maybe I was, but I'm not now. Julie sees the difference." "Aren't you spending too much time with Julie?" Margaret asked and could have bitten her tongue out. "No," Bill said. "I'm not. Gosh, Mom, I'm going to be away from Julie. I'm going to be away from both of you." But it's harder to leave Julie, Margaret's swift thought finished. She musn't be like that. She musn't be jealous of Julia. "I've got to tell you. Mom," Bill was saying, "I passed my physical." "Oh, Bill!" Margaret knew she was hanging on desperately to her courage, but she musn't let Bill down. "I'm glad," she said after a minute. Bill pushed back his hair and his young voice soared. "Gosh, Mom, I'm in the army now." LONG before Margaret had time to get an answer from Stephen, Bill was gone. It seemed to her as if the army had opened and swallowed him up. Working all day at the Red Gross office and teaching nutrition three nights a week was important work she knew, but it left her with an aching void. On one particularly lonely evening, she wandered about the study. It had been Bill's playroom when he was a child. In the corner by the window she could still see a whole army of tin soldiers, and over by the radiator ran an electric train. She must see the big blue chair, not these things out of the past, but when she sat down in the chair, Stephen came to play on the floor with little Bill, and together they laid more track. Bill's high trebble mingling with Stephen's deep tones. Then they were gone, and Margaret heard nothing but the ticking of the clock. She didn't want to be sorry for herself. She wanted to make her contribution to the war as much as anyone. But she knew a lot of people whose homes weren't broken up. People who didn't have to look around and say, "My home is entirely empty now that both my husband and my son are gone. There is no one to keep house for." The sharp ringing of the bell broke into her reverie. At the door a messenger handed her a special delivery letter. It was from Bill, and she opened it with one motion. "Julie and I want to get married," he wrote without preamble. "Julie will talk to you about it. Be an angel and persuade Gora to give her consent." Margaret sat staring at the letter, a little frown between her fine brows. They can't do that, she told herself. Hastily she put on a street dress. She'd go and see Gora at once. Together they'd nip this thing in the bud. Bill was just lonesome and homesick. He'd be all right a little later. Surely he and Julia had had no such idea when he went away. He musn't now, she told herself COURAGE IS THE WORD FOR IT 361 for the hundredth time when she rang the Crandall?s bell. Cora came to the door. "How do you do, Mrs. Jamison?? she said in a low, contralto voice. "Come over by the fireplace, won't you?" Cora seated herself opposite her. In her red hostess coat that brought out the almost purple tint in her hair, Margaret couldn't help thinking that she was beautiful. But it was a studied pose she knew as was the huskiness in her voice. "So the kids want to get married," she drawled. "Well, I've told Julia she's much too young." "They are both too young," Margaret said. "Julie is nearly twenty," Cora said, "but I think she'll realize that she has duties here at home." "Maybe I can talk to her, too," Margaret said. It flitted through her mind that perhaps they had no right to interfere in the children's lives. But she put the thought aside. Bill and Julia would thank them for it later. "You wouldn't conspire against me, would you?" It was Julia. She came in with a little rush and put her arms around Margaret's neck. "Bill and I want this so very much," she said. "I'm sorry, dear," Margaret began, but Cora cut in crisply, "Stop putting on an act. You don't know what you want." Julia's eyes struck fire. "I do know," she said. "I know I love Bill and I know he loves me. Margaret knows we meant to wait." Her young lips quivered. "How do we know that there will be a tomorrow for us? Bill may not come back. We have to take our happiness when we can get it." Margaret drew her breath in sharply. It was so like the courage of youth to call a spade a spade. When you were older there were thoughts you crowded down, didn't let materialize. "Bill said his mother would understand," Julia was saying. She was standing in front of Margaret now and her young breasts rose and fell stormily. "I could get a job down there. We could have his week-end leaves together." "I'm sorry, dear," Margaret began again. "Why does everyone have to be like this? If Bill's old enough to fight, he's old enough to get married." The door slammed after Julia, and Margaret got slowly to her feet. At home she went disconsolately to bed. Dear Stephen, she thought, I need you to help me. She pulled the blankets more firmly about her, resting her head in the hollow of the pillow, but sleep wouldn't come. She hadn't realized how much she had depended on Stephen. Julia was so young, so tragic. Was Bill feeling the same way? Oh, Stephen, am I right? She breathed. Kok Ok I must stiffen my spine, she told herself the next morning,. Because I'm sure I'm right. Automatically she opened the morning paper. On the front page of the local news a picture caught her eye. It was Cora Crandall and under it the caption, "Former Actress Joins Theatrical Troupe. Cora Bedford Crandall Will Tour Army Camps." Margaret sat staring at it. How can she leave Sally Sue? She thought. But of course she can if Julia is there. Relief flooded over her. That's what Cora meant about duties at home. It was going to work out. She wouldn't have to write to Bill and seem to interfere. But she had reckoned without her own warm heart. It was late afternoon when Julia came to see her. '1 don't know anyone to talk to but you," she said. She had the morning paper in her hand and her eyes were red. '1 can't go away and leave Sally Sue." Margaret stifled a quick desire to take Julia in her arms and comfort her. "Cora is planning to leave," she heard herself say. "Cora is just Cora. I'm Sally Sue's big sister." Julia's face worked. '1 shouldn't have made plans to go away." Margaret felt as if her heart were turning over. Here was someone strong and courageous, able to face life. Bill was courageous, too, doing a man's part. Suddenly she held out her arms to Julia. "Do you think Sally Sue would be happy here with me?" she asked. V.E. Day Observed PRESIDENT TRUMAN told the nation in a broadcast at 9 a.m. E. W. T., Tuesday, May 8, 1945, ?This is a solemn but a glorious hour. General Eisenhower informs me that the forces of Germany have surrendered to the United Nations. The flags of freedom fly over all Europe." This declaration brought some comfort and hope to the mothers of the United States; however, faced with the rising fury of a continuing ' war against Japan, no mother could fully rejoice in view of the cruel and heartrending days lying ahead. President Truman also set aside Sunday, May 13, as a day of national prayer, and said that it is eminently fitting that the day of prayer should also be Mother's Day. To the liberated countries of Europe and to the United Kingdom where the terrible ravages of war have been experienced, Victory-Europe Day meant a blessed deliverance from the acts of an oppressor; but to the citizens of our nation whose shores have been free from hostilities, V-E Day was only a day of observance to commemorate the end of one theatre of war?only a marker along the path of peace whose'end cannot yet be glimpsed by mortal eyes. In the heavy hearts of Latter-day Saints, too, is the sure knowledge that lasting peace will not abide on the earth until the nations, in reality and not merely in name, become Christian nations? until repentance, entering into the hearts of men, dictates the acts of nations. When that day dawns then indeed will it be a glorious day. M. C. S.
