Daughters and Heirs Grace S. Cozzens CHRISTIE GLENN DAVIS sat at the head of the table, hostess to her three widowed sisters-in-law, all self-respecting widows, not a grass among them. The mirror, opposite Christie, reflected a slender, reddish-haired woman in a smoke-gray dress that matched her wistful eyes. For quite some time she had been planning this little dinner for just the four of them, in her apartment of carved woods and wrought iron. She felt little shooting pains of fear. Not that the meal would fail to please?. No, she hadn't forgotten that Ella was especially fond of baked ham, that Olive liked broiled squab, and that Amanda's favorite dessert was lemon pie. The meal was planned to please. To open the way. And she must watch for the right opening and take it when it came. She helped Ella to a serving of ham?Ella, that buxom girl of nineteen who had married Daniel twenty years ago. Dan, handsome, vital, had led Ella a dance, until Dad Glenn deeded him, his eldest son, a third of his perfectly cultivated ranch, and Dan had settled down to farming and fathering a family. Christie noticed Ella had grown older by eight or ten inches around the mid-section, though she still had the serene face of a madonna, with her soft gray eyes, and brown hair parted in the middle and knotted at the back of her neck. But her meek look belied her brisk, chuckle-filled speech. Ella owned that part of the farm next to the river. The old Bear River on which Christie had rowed, in which she had waded, by which she had picnicked when a child, and on whose sandbars she had lain full-length beside its warm, swashy waters?the old river with its never-ending theme story and song. A Swiss bronze clock on the mantel loosed a series of soft silvery chimes. "How grand!" Olive exclaimed. "Oh, I'd give anything for a clock like that." "Golly, yes!" Ella chuckled. Across the table Christie was watching. Why couldn't it have been Amanda who admired the clock? It was Manda she wanted to bargain clocks with. But practical Manda said nothing. It naturally would be Olive?Olive exquisitely gowned in folds of georgette and lace, her flaxen, fluffy curls and red lips reminding one of a fancy figurine. Olive had been a brideybride, but had proved to be a tyrannical wife and a resentful widow, when Lee had succumbed to a sudden heart attack. She was a feverish sort. Always wanting things she couldn't have?never satisfied with things that were hers. Olive and her four children lived in the big ranch house, with its dozens of windows, six verandas, and many rooms and closets?all crowded with memories of the Glenn family. Page  Amanda, Jed's wife and the last to wear the widow's weeds, sat at the foot of the table. Hazel-eyed and thin, she was a little woman with a fighting chin. There was something solid and real about her. The auto crash that took Jed had left a little scar across, her cheek. She and Christie had gone to school together, and Amanda had often come to their house and played on the very spot of ground where Mandy's house now stood, surrounded by vast flower beds. Christie knew each rock and rill of it. Every nook where the Johnny-jump-ups and the wild bluebells came first in the spring. And the summits beyond that pierced the azure sky ?Christie knew every peak. ISN?T this the grandest meal?" Ella chuckled. "There's no such thing as beating Chris cooking." 'That's right," Amanda said in her thin, firm voice. "Our grandmothers might have beat her piecing and spinning, but not cooking." Christie's heart skipped a beat. Here was an opening She rushed into it. "Don't flatter me, giris," she smiled shyly. "But speaking of spinning? whatever became of my grandmother's old spinning wheel? Dad left it up in the barn loft where you live, Olive. Is it still there?" "No-o," Olive drawled, accepting a cup of cocoa. "After Lee died the kids got it down. They have it in their playhouse." 'Tlayhouse?" Christie repeated. "It's too frail, Olive. A long time ago my grandmother brought it across the ocean with her?and across the plains." "That's none of my business," Olive laughed softly. "But, Olive, its a keepsake. It's over a hundred years old." "That's just it," Olive said. "Who wants the old thing under her feet?" She lifted her fork elegantly to her lips. "A spoke or two are missing, but the girls still spin on it. And they have a good time." A frantic little horror rose in Christie's bosom. A spoke or two missing! There came to her, across the years, a picture of her little grandmother in her billowy skirts and lacy cap, sitting at the spinning wheel in the corner of the old log house on the Glenn farm, her small feet deftly treading. The wheel was whirling?fibers of wool twirling into yarn. And all the while the little old lady was telling the children stories of her long trip across the Atlantic. Two months, she'd told them, she and her three children had been in a sailboat with a few clothes and the old spinning wheel. "That is," she had said, "I left the old country with three, but I buried my baby in the ocean." She would tell them that their grandpa had died in Denmark, and that his last words to her had been: "Sell everything and take the children to Utah." She had sold everything but the old spinning wheel. Christie's eyes grew bright. They met Olive's. "Tell the girls," she said, appealingly, "that Auntie will buy them any toys they choose, if they will let her have the spinning wheel." "No," Olive said, without looking up from boning her squab. "No. I wouldn't do that. It would be cheating you. And the girls are satisfied with it." They all began chatting pleasantly again. Christie couldn't believe she'd failed. She musn't fail. She must beg for it. DAUGHTERS AND HEIRS 367 "Fd like so much to have it, Ohve/" she said earnestly. 'T'll pay you well for it." "Pay me for it?" Olive laughed. "Tou should see it. The old thing is about ready to drop to pieces. It's not worth anything." "It is to me," Christie said. "Well, the girls like it and I wouldn't ask them to part with it," Olive smiled lazily. "For Ian' sakes, Chris, lay off!" Ella giggled. Christie nodded. She musn't risk petty argument. It was understood, among all of them, that she had no rights about the farm where she had been born and reared, and where the three others now lived. The sons had inherited that. But if she could only make them somehow realize she was a part. Her underlying wishes did not represent a very great stake. There was a broader ?a more fundamental want... Now the sons and heirs were all gone... She passed the jam to Ella. "Father gave his sword to Dan," she said. "I wonder if you still have it, Ella?" "Yes. It's still sticking around." "And has it ever been unsheathed?" Christie asked. "You know, dad said he never wanted it unsheathed." She smiled a little proudly. "He said it with the grandeur and maje'y of an old soldier who had known the rigors of the battle field: "That sword has never been thrust nor unsheathed since the day the* Yankees won. And I never want it misused."" Christie looked directly at Ella. "Has it been?" "Has it been?" Ella laughed. "Bob and Gil use it to fence with. Bob made a wooden one to go with it. You should see them parry and prime." Christie winced. "Isn't a sword a pretty dangerous weapon for boys to fence with?" "Oh, no," Ella replied lightly. "I made them break the point off." Christie jumped up and began clearing the table for the dessert. "Would you mind selling me what is left of it?" she asked abruptly. Ella's mouth curved into a possessive smile. "You may as well cry for the moon, as to ask them to give it up. "Do you think they would part with it for a brace of new foils?" "I'm afraid not," Ella answered. "Besides, if it means that much to you, it means that much to me. Your dad gave that old saber to Dan and his boys are going to keep it." Again, Christie nodded. Another bit of hope crumpled. Her stormy gray eyes met Olive's cool blue eyes. "Somewhere in the closet under the stairs in the old farmhouse, there is a powder horn, a bullet mold, and a couple of soldier caps with tiny brass guns crossed in front..." "They're all smashed to smithereens long ago," Olive said. Christie placed the dessert before her guests and refilled their glasses, while they chatted about things about the farm and their children. Her hands trembled. She sat down and braced herself for a last question, the last but by no means the least. She exchanged looks with Amanda. Then slowly she spoke. "Manda, when the folks grew too old to manage the farm and turned it over to their sons and came to live with me, mother told me she left the family clock with Jed, since he was her oldest living child. You remember, it was of brown wood about a foot tall."
"Sure I remember it," Amanda nodded.
Christie's voice lowered reminiscently. "It had a rounded top, with a full glass door. On the lower half, a yellow pointer dog was painted in the center of a blue circle. . . ."
"And the pendulum swung from the point of his nose to the tip of his tail," Amanda interrupted. "We used to watch it when we were kids."
"Is it still there, Manda?"
"Sure," Amanda said. "But I haven't a shelf for it. Some day I'll get one and have the old ticker antiqued, and get a new hand for it and see if it will keep time."
"A new hand?" Christie breathed out. "What happened?"
Amanda tinkered with her water glass. "One day I happened to set it on a chair and along came Sammy and picked off the minute hand. I could'a whipped 'im."
"Couldn't you have had it put back on?"
"He broke it," Amanda scoffed. "And I threw it in the garbage can."
CHRISTIE'S attention slipped away from her guests. Once again through feverish eyes she was watching the minute hand. She was in her mother's big four-poster bed swathed in blankets in an attempt to break a fever. She was fretting and watching the big hand slowly count off the long minutes until the blankets could gradually be taken off. . . . Heat pricked at her temples. That old minute hand had chronicled every event of the Glenn family. It had recorded the births of the five babies. Timed their growth. Got them to school on time. Measured the long hours and the last moments to the heartbroken family around the death bed of little Jack, an early victim of appendicitis. It had marked the beginning of her wedding reception, and finally had pointed to the hour when she said goodbye to her family and the farm and had followed Dick, a young naval officer, on his uncharted course about the world. She'd lived in many a port and had remained in one place only during the time her parents had spent their last years with her. As from a distance, she saw her guests folding their napkins. Goose flesh crept over her like a rash.
"Amanda," she said a little huskily, "now that Jed is gone, do you mind letting me have the family clock?" She glanced at the mantel. "I'll get you a new one, and save it all the way from Switzerland."
"Why should I?" Amanda asked politely.
"Do you think it's too much for me to want the old family clock?"
Amanda's jaw set. "I sure do. Your ma gave that clock to Jed, and it's never going to leave Jed's family."
There was a moment of oppressive silence, then the three widowed sisters-in-law began exchanging good-natured gibes among themselves.
"She's a good cook all right," Ella chuckled. "But imagine the selfish gal trying to get our keepsakes away from us."
"Heirlooms," Christie countered. DAUGHTERS AND HEIRS "Maybe I am selfish, since I have memories of them that none of you have. Maybe I did have my nerve asking?expecting?-since sons are heirs." The hour finally came when the guests began to take their leave. With a tired, let-down feeling, Christie escorted her kinswomen to the entrance hall to say goodbye. As they entered the sunroom a little red bird ran out from a rustic clock and mechanically "cuckooed" the hour of five. "Oh, Chris!" Olive cried with delight. "Where in the world did you get it? I'd give anything for a clock like that." Christie looked bewildered. "Even the old spinning wheel?" "Even the old spinning wheel!" Olive exulted. "The kids would be crazy over it." Christie quietly placed the cuckoo clock in Olive's out-stretched hands. Amanda pursed her thin lips. "That's not fair," she shrugged, "giving Olive a gift from your swell apartment, and not us." Olive held the clock proudly. "Thanks, Chris," she shrilled. Christie looked at Amanda. "Name your gift," she said softly. Amanda scanned the room warily. Christie hinted, "How about the pair of love birds in the gilded cage? "The what?" Amanda raised a skeptical brow. Christie pointed toward the window. "See," she said, "the darling little blue and green love birds." Amanda frowned. "Oh, no," she scoffed. "Our old cottonwood trees are full of squawking birds. 369 But, that gorgeous fuchsia with the red and purple bells?" "Yours for the asking," Christie interrupted. Her hands were a little unsteady as she held the potted plant toward Manda. Amanda took it gingerly. "I guess you'll want the old clock in its place," she said. Christie nodded. Amanda laid her cheek against a bloom. "Well, that suits me all right." Ella drew herself as erect as her chubby legs would allow. "Lan' sakes," she sighed, "what do I get? The boys will take a duck-fit when you two march in with your gifts from Chris, after her trips around the world." "What are you waiting for, Sis?" Christie smiled. "Choose!" Mia laughed softly. "I'm too decent a person to mention what I?d like." Her eager glance shot across the room, touching a miniature aquarium. "But, I?m all wound up over?well, I won't say, but I know the boys'd trade the old saber in a minute." With quiet grimness, Christie handed the fish bow] to Ella. "Relax," she smiled. "Oh, Chris, how did you ever guess?" she gasped. "What are they, anyway? You must tell me how to feed them." "They are guppies," Christie said, "and here are the foods and directions in full for their care." "Goopies," Ella repeated, caressing the bowl. In the vanishing daylight Christie sat alone. "Bless 'em," she murmured as she watched the car with (Concluded on page 372)
