Belle Smith Spafford Called to Be Ninth General President of Relief Society, April 1945 Marianne C. Sharp First Counselor in General Presidency "O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day" (Doc. And Gov. 4:2). THE admonition of the Lord contained in the above verse of the Doctrine and Covenants, a favorite quotation of Belle Smith Spafford, has been heeded by her throughout life. This observance coupled with the manner in which she has developed her great capabilities in working for the Relief Society resulted in the call by the First Presidency, on April 6, 1945, of Sister Spafford to become the ninth general president of Relief Society.
President Spafford will be welcomed to her new position by a host of friends, members of the Relief Society throughout the United States and in the stakes of Canada and Mexico, whom she has met during the past ten years while she has traveled extensively in the interest of the Society. They will recall her affectionately for her friendly interest in regard to their special problems, and the ability which she has demonstrated in helping to solve them.
It was just ten years ago this April 1945 that Sister Spafford was called by President Louise Y. Robison from her position as counselor to President Marie Tanner of the Wells Stake Relief Society to become a member of the General Board. In December of 1937, she was asked to assume the added responsibility of being editor of Thefollowing the death of Sister Mary C. Kimball. During the eight years that Sister Spafford has edited the Magazine it has had a phenomenal growth in subscriptions   increasing from 40,000 in 1937 to 72,000 as of April 1945. The excellence of the contents has been of a high order which has steadily improved over the years, reflecting the advancement of the women of the Church in writing skills. It was in 1942 that a short-story contest was inaugurated by the General Board which has resulted in encouraging Church women to enter the field of fiction and improved the content of the Magazine in that line. As editor she has consistently manifested a great desire to meet first, the spiritual, and then the literary reading needs of the readers of the Magazine. When Sister Lyman was called to become general president, in 1940, she retained Sister Spafford as editor, and gave to her the added responsibility of serving as an editor of A Centenary of Relief Society published to commemorate the first hundred years of the Society. The knowledge gained from this experience has given to Sister Spafford a broad understanding of the rise and development of the Society which will prove invaluable to her in her new position.
In addition to editorial duties, President Spafford has always carried her full share of General Board responsibilities, and has done preeminent work as the chairman of important committees. Her ability in this line was signally recognized in November 1942 when she was called by President Lyman to succeed Sister Donna D. Sorensen as her second counselor in charge of educational work. The faithful performance by President Spafford of every call which has been made upon her for Church service whether to serve in the Sunday School, the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association or the Relief Society, to which so many years of her life have been devoted, has culminated in the present call to head the great Relief Society.
BELLE SMITH SPAFFORD was born of goodly parents. She has never known the loving, watchful care of a father for her own father, John Gibson Smith, who was born in Toode, died when he was only forty years old and before Belle Smith Spafford was born. Her young mother was thus left to face life alone and to rear her six children and an orphaned son of a brother. The family resided in Salt Lake City. Sister Smith was a true Latter-day Saint, and her wise sayings are often quoted by her descendants and continue to guide them in their daily conduct.
Sister Spafford received her schooling in the Salt Lake City schools, at the L.D.S. high school and is a graduate of the University of Utah Normal School. The teaching skill which she gained in the years she spent teaching in the Salt Lake City schools and at the Training School at the Brigham Young University has been reflected in the professional supervision which she has given to the better teaching of the lessons taught in Relief Society. She pays high tribute to the influence on her life of that great personality President George H. Brimhall who imbued her with the importance of religious and spiritual values in education, and of that outstanding educator, President Franklin S. Harris, for helping her to appreciate the values of high educational standards and the necessity of continuous application in improving one's teaching skills.
President Spafford is the wife of Willis Earl Spafford who is Field Deputy of Internal Revenue. Without his tender care which he always has guarded her, without his unselfish acceptance of the calls which have been made upon her time, increasing with the passing of the years, without his full support and wholehearted co-operation, it would not have been possible for Sister Spafford to have continued her Church duties and at the same time to have cared for her family of two children. Their daughter Mary at the present time is doing postgraduate work in social work at the University of Utah, and their son, Earl Smith Spafford, is in the navy serving as a hospital apprentice at Portsmouth, Virginia.
In leading forward this greatest of all women's organization, President Belle Spafford's great concern, as has also been that of her predecessors in this office, will be to follow out, implicitly, the desires of the Priesthood in regard to Relief Society, and to so plan and so shape its activities as to fully support the great Church Welfare Plan, and to foster and strengthen in Relief Society members a living testimony of the gospel.
It will be a joy to me to work under the guidance of Sister Spafford in the general presidency of Relief Society. She is a thorough Latterday Saint and is guided in her decisions by the standards of the gospel. She is a considerate and fair fellow worker, always ready to undertake the major part of any assignment and to help out in any need, at the same time, however, expecting a high standard of performance in return. She is a tireless and prodigious worker. For the past eight years she has spent many hours of each working day on some phase of Relief Society activity, and her assignments have been many and varied. The great honor which has come to President Spafford may be considered as a merited blessing on her years of self-sacrificing and devoted service.
RELIEF SOCIETY Amy Jeanne Donnei One hundred years have vanished down the skies As apple blossoms disappear with spring, And still the work goes on! Strong, lingering, A Prophet's inspiration and command Still guide us, with a love that never dies. Throughout the years a valiant, growing band Of mothers, loyal, humble, kind and true. Has sought and helped the needy, lit anew The flame of hope in many a careworn heart, Soothed many a fevered brow with gentle hand, And strong and steadfast, gladly borne its part In trouble, and when famine swept the land. Dear Father, by whose blessings all these years Thy daughters have grown numerous and strong. Facing the coming years with quiet eyes, Humbly we pray for wisdom to do right. And courage that strides onward though through tears. And deep humility and faith in thee. That we may do thy will, and with the light Of truth and kindness and the Spirit's fire Hold high the standard that the Prophet gave With God's command and covenant unto Those mothers that he blessed so long ago. If we can be as gentle and as kind. As valiant, righteous, generous, and true As those first mothers, then our hearts' desire Thou wilt have granted, for we ask of thee But to be worthy of the name they bore. And of thy blessings on us, as of yore.
