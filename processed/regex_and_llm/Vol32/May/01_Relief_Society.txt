RELIEF SOCIETY Amy Jeanne Donnei One hundred years have vanished down the skies As apple blossoms disappear with spring, And still the work goes on! Strong, lingering, A Prophet's inspiration and command Still guide us, with a love that never dies. Throughout the years a valiant, growing band Of mothers, loyal, humble, kind and true. Has sought and helped the needy, lit anew The flame of hope in many a careworn heart, Soothed many a fevered brow with gentle hand, And strong and steadfast, gladly borne its part In trouble, and when famine swept the land. Dear Father, by whose blessings all these years Thy daughters have grown numerous and strong. Facing the coming years with quiet eyes, Humbly we pray for wisdom to do right. And courage that strides onward though through tears. And deep humility and faith in thee. That we may do thy will, and with the light Of truth and kindness and the Spirit's fire Hold high the standard that the Prophet gave With God's command and covenant unto Those mothers that he blessed so long ago. If we can be as gentle and as kind. As valiant, righteous, generous, and true As those first mothers, then our hearts' desire Thou wilt have granted, for we ask of thee But to be worthy of the name they bore. And of thy blessings on us, as of yore. Marianne Clark Sharp First Counselor in General Presidency, April 1945 President Amy Brown Lyman MARIANNE C. SHARP IT was while attending a Relief Society convention in New York City more than a decade ago, that I first learned of the excellent service being rendered the organization by Marianne Clark Sharp, the newly appointed first counselor in the general presidency of the Relief Society, who then resided there. She was pointed out as one of the ablest and most faithful workers in that locality and, best of all, one who was willing and happy to work wherever she was most needed. It mattered not to her whether it was as class leader, visiting teacher, officer, or lay member, her interest and enthusiasm in the work she had to do was always of the highest quality. Page 262 She served while in New York as literature and theology class leader, president of Queen's Branch Society, stake board member, and finally as stake counselor to Mrs. Lorena Fletcher. Mrs. Howard R. Driggs, also of New York, remarked at that time that Marianne would make a very excellent General Board member, and she expressed the hope that some day she would see her working in this capacity. It was only natural, after her return to Utah, that Sister Sharp should continue her work in the Relief Society cause. Her devotion and efficiency were soon recognized in both ward and stake where her work as a class leader became so outstanding that no one who knew her or her accomplishments was surprised at the call that came to her, in January 1940, to serve as a member of the General Board. And now at this time, her appointment, on April 6, 1945, as first counselor in the general presidency of the organization is heartily approved by Relief Society women generally, and especially by her fellow Board members who know her best and appreciate her most. Blessed with a noble heritage, a rich background, rare native endowments, broad education and training, and with unwavering faith in the gospel of the Master, Sister Sharp is especially well fitted for this place of honor and trust. She is also blessed with the support of a devoted and understanding husband, a Christian gentleman of the highest order, and a faithful Latterday Saint. Ivor Sharp to whom she was married in 1927 is the present manager of KSL. He came to this position from the Long Lines Department of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in New York City. He is known in the business world as a man of fine character, outstanding ability and distinction, and is loved, honored, and respected by his associates in business as well as by his fellow workers in the Church. There are three lovely and interesting children in the Sharp home Luceine (Sally) Louise, and Annetta. To these children the parents are devoted.
Sister Sharp is the daughter of President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., first counselor in the First Presidency of the Church, and the late Luceine Savage Clark. Theirs was a home where the standards of the Church were always strictly observed, and where the children were taught faith in God and in the latter-day work, that the greatest joy and satisfaction came to those who adhere to the religious life. Sister Luceine Savage Clark also loved and was devoted to Relief Society and its ideals, and worked in the organization all of her mature life. Her heart is no doubt made glad with joy and pride to have this greatly deserved honor come to her sweet and lovely daughter Marianne.
DURING her five years service on the General Board, Sister Sharp has visited conferences and conventions and she has served on a number of important committees. Her major task, however, has been in the editorial field. With her discriminating judgment, quickness of perception, clarity of mind, and her capacity for work, and with the diligence and dispatch with which she works, she has given invaluable service as an editor. She assisted our new General President Belle S. Spafford in compiling, preparing, and editing A Centenary of Relief Society, published by the General Board during our centennial year, 1942. For a period she was assistant to Sister Spafford, the editor of Theand, in 1943, was named associate editor in which capacity she has served since that time. The many positions which Marianne has held have all come to her unsought. She has accepted these calls because she is obedient and because of her sense of service and her ardent desire to do something helpful for her Church and for her community.
Sister Sharp received her education in the grade and high schools of Washington, D. C. and at the University of Utah. From the latter institution she was graduated, in 1934, with high honors. She was awarded a teaching fellowship in Latin during her senior year and she continued teaching that subject at the University after her graduation.
Sister Sharp has rare gifts of spirit, mind and heart, with a deep humility. She is frank and honest, tender and sympathetic. She is generous and appreciative of the work and ability of others. While she has clear-cut, positive views, she is always open minded and teachable, always ready to listen to the views of others. But with her right and principle must come first. Above all she is loyal to those in her position of authority over her and gives them full support. She has great reverence for and is always obedient to the Priesthood. With these fine characteristics and qualifications her future is sure to be one of achievement. PARALLEL Alice Money Bailey I Strong and lithe they were, and full of grace  The legend sons of Helaman  for such, In tenderness, he called them, loved them much, Though they were soldiers his the right of mace Above them. Striplings all, they were  each face Unbearded; sweet of mouth as yet no touch Of war was theirs, no guilty shame, no clutch Of fear: The pure in heart! The swift of pace! And when he asked: "Would ye go out to fight?" They answered: "Yea! To free our fathers' land"  Rehearsed their mothers' teachings how the right Prevailed. In soberness they took the brand. Nor wavered in belief the God of might Would hold their precious lives within his hand. II Troubled in his soul and torn with doubt Was Helaman for on the plain below The battle raged. On Nephite friends, the foe Had turned the Lamanites and runner, scout Brought only news of tragedy and rout. For Antipus was slain, and blow on blow Was dealt his reeling columns. Tardy, slow. The leader sent his sons to draw them out. They fought as gods that day. Each flashing sword Was steeled by righteousness, the searing strain Of conflict ribbed by faith. At last, the horde, Abject, surrendered. Helaman, in pain Of fear, set forth to count. Proud words record Not one of his two thousand lads was slain! III The centuries roll out on a disk of time That turns upon itself" for still men lust For power and riches, fame and toss the crust Of beggary to brother men each age a mime Of ages gone before. The parts, sublime And wretched all are there the foul, the just, The valiant. Nations leap to glory, rust. Decay, and crumble. Man alone is prime. Still mothers teach their youth simplicity. Obedience, faith and love 'and how to shun The coils of earth how touch infinity. Still are some who pray when day is done, Who know the source of power Divinity  And still in battle Sons of Helaman. Gertrude Ryberg Garff Second Counselor in General Presidency, April 1945 Edith Smith Elliott THE wise selection of Gertrude Ryberg Garff as second counselor to President Belle Smith Spafford of the Latter-day Saint Relief Society will be a blessing to the women of the Church. Her training and background fit her admirably for her new position. Above all else, she has a firm testimony of the gospel of Jesus Ghrist, and although young in years, she is old in experience. Sister Garff was born in Hyrum, Utah, to Charlotte Critchlow and Eric William Ryberg. Both the Critchlows and the Rybergs contribute a rich heritage to Gertrude. Her mother's forbears rank high in early educational fields and were participants in the American Revolution. Sister Ryberg has been a leader, active in Relief Society. Gertrude's father's parents were converts to the Church from Sweden. They settled in Logan, Utah, and played a forceful part in the development of that community. Brother Ryberg has been a successful contractor and is an outstanding executive in the business world. Sister Garff was five years old when the family moved to Salt Lake City in Wasatch Ward. She is fortunate to have had parents who trained her in the paths of knowledge and righteousness. She has always had great faith in her Heavenly Father, which has been a great source of comfort to her. She has been a firm believer in the fact that GERTRUDE R. GARFF *'faith without works is dead," so she has willingly done her part.   She completed her early studies in the Salt Lake City schools. Desiring further knowledge and training, she entered the University of Utah. At the end of her second year she received and honored a call to fill a mission for her Church. She was assigned to the Eastern States Mission under the presidency of Brother James H. Moyle. Here she labored as a field missionary in Jamestown, New York, and in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Her special assignment was radio work. Her mission strengthened her testimony in the divinity of Christ and gave her a religious schooling that has helped pattern her life.
Her mission furthered her desire for learning. She knew that the "glory of God is intelligence," so when she returned home she once more entered the University and graduated in 1935 with a Bachelor of Science degree. Her major was in textiles, with a minor in foods and child welfare.
IN October 1935, she married Mark Brimhall Garff, son of Tryphena Brimhall (sister of President George Brimhall) and George P. Garff. She had met her future husband (who had been home two years from a Danish mission) at a Granite Stake conference where they had both been called upon to discuss their missionary experiences.
In September 1937, Brother and Sister Garff were again called to the Lord's service this time to preside over the Danish Mission with headquarters in Copenhagen. Their son Mark was only two and one-half months old so this made the planning for so long a journey a major problem. However, with faith in God they lost no time settling to the task before them. Both were very young to be given so important an assignment but, in spite of this, they made an enviable record. Sister Garff learned the language so that she could assume her full responsibilities as head of the women's auxiliaries, with a special and personal interest in Relief Society. She won the love and trust of the Danish saints. Her warmth and understanding made her role as "mission mother" a source of strength to the
in the welfare of young people was ever apparent not has it even ceased since she returned to Zion.
Besides discharging her many missionary duties admirably, Gertrude found time to study the social, historical, economic, and cultural aspects of the Danes. She learned to love and appreciate these Norsemen. A lover of art, crafts, literature, and music, she spent any free time she had in museums, art galleries, and opera houses.
She enjoyed the companionship of her baby. She used to take him with her on bicycle rides in and around Copenhagen tucked into the baby's seat on the front of her bicycle.
When the war clouds gathered and broke into World War II, our missionaries were called home. The first available space that President Garff could obtain to transport his wife, little son, and several Scandinavian missionaries to home shores was on a tramp steamer. President Garff had to remain to reorganize the mission on a local basis. We can well imagine the anxiety of that parting. Faith alone made it possible. The ship had to take a northern route up around Iceland for safety. The voyage lasted seventeen days and the passage was unusually rough. Gertrude and the baby arrived home in November, in time to spend thanksgiving with her father and mother. By Christmas, President Garff returned safely and the little family was grateful to be reunited.
The following January 1940, Sister Garff was appointed a member of the General Board of Relief Society under its new president, Amy Brown Lyman. Sister Garff and Sister Lyman had developed a close friendship in Europe which Sister Lyman was presiding over the women's auxiliaries of the European mission. Sister Garff has said of her many occasions that she doesn't know how she could have carried on her great responsibilities had it not been for Sister Lyman's frequent letters of direction and encouragement. Sister Lyman's deep understanding of people and their problems, with her helpful disposition made it natural for Gertrude to turn to her for counsel and advice. She was very happy to be called into a continued association with so noble a character.
Sister Garff is friendly and approachable. She works well with people. She has the courage of her convictions, yet is pliable to the extent that if she is shown a better way she willingly accepts it. She attacks each assignment with an open-mindedness intelligence.
Gertrude and Mark have three young children: Mark R. (eight years), Charlotte (four years), and baby Georgia (one and one-half years). These human treasures along with her splendid husband receive her untiring devotion.
From her husband, her father, and her mother, she will receive maximum support in her new position.
