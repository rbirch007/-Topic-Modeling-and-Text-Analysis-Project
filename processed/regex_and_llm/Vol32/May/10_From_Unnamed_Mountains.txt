FROM UNNAMED MOUNTAINS Dott J. Sartori From unnamed mountains marred with violence You write "How are the hills of home this year?" A tendril groping for some permanence To twine beyond the loaded bandoleer Here are the counterparts of memory. The canyon, cleft within your exiled brain. The misted peaks, become reality. I troll the ageless certitudes again Down to you from a wind-washed eminence Where russet soil has settled on this tier Of rock. The evergreen still drives its lance Into the sky, a changeless cavalier. The butterflies thread woods along the stream. Woof of the forest and weft of your dream. Assurance of unaltered majesty In the long-lived profile of a precipice, I send, and faith no stricken earth nor tree Shall disillusion your returning eyes.... Upon the northern slope, the aspen stems Glow silver-green, pale as a luna moth; The fern is beaded lace between the hems And petticoats of cool and living cloth. This boulder sheltered daisies small as these The age, when under Pinta's listing spars, Mutinous eyes, from strange and fearful seas, Were lifted to the same familiar stars. On some dark retina, now dust, once lay Horizons I delineate today.
