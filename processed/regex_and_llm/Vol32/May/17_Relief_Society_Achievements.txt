Relief Society Achievements 1944-45 THE month of May brings to a close the Relief Society educational season. In spite of curtailments and handicaps due to the war, the 1944-45 season has been a successful one marked by unusual development for Relief Society women and great accomplishment for the Society. With few exceptions, high standards have been maintained in all phases of the work, and Relief Society workers may justifiably view this past season with satisfaction and pride. The General Board sincerely appreciates the efforts of Relief Society officers and class leaders as well as the strength of Relief Society membership. It commends each one for her devotion to the Society, for the time, energy, and ability she has given to the work, and for the part she has played in the growth and advancement of Relief Society. It recognizes the support Relief Society women have given to the war programs sponsored by the Society, and the service they have rendered in their respective communities. The elements which make any organization successful are good beginnings or a sound foundation, a purposeful and worthy program, a capable leadership, and a devoted membership. Relief Society has all of these. It was organized by the Prophet "under the Priesthood after Page 280 the pattern of the Priesthood." No more worthy objectives could animate any organization; namely, to develop its members spiritually and intellectually, and "to manifest benevolence irrespective of creed or nationality." For more than one hundred years the leadership of Relief Society, including the general, stake, mission, and local leaders, under the direction of the Priesthood has been sincere, energetic, capable and above average; and no organization could boast of a more devoted membership? women who are bound together by the ties of the gospel and who value their organization as an auxiliary of the Church and as a medium through which women may attain full self-realization and render satisfying service. To be a part of such an organization is a blessing and a privilege. True, in the process of performing our part, those of us who have contributed to the onward march of the Society during the past season may have met with discouragements and with obstacles which have had to be surmounted under difficulties, but the surmounting of these, rather than retarding us, has actually developed and strengthened us. In total, the benefits that have accrued from efforts put forth should leave Relief Society women satisfied and happy at the end of this educational season. BSS.
