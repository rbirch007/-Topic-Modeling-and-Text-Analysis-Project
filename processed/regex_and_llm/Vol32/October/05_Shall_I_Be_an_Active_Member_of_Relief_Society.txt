Shall I Be an Active Member of Relief Society? A Question Which is Vital to Every Woman in the Church Kate M. Barker Former Member Relief Society General Board 
AT the dedication of the science hall on the campus of one of our large universities, a student guide explained to the group he was conducting, "In this room the tables for these sensitive instruments are stone pillars built on solid rock. If we are to get accurate readings it is necessary to have a foundation that goes down below the vibrations, shocks, and jars of the earth's surface."
When the news came of the restoration of peace to the world, we received it with humble, prayerful thanksgiving. For five long years we had prayed for this moment, hoping that if the opportunity were given us again we would build a better world. The war has been a major spiritual shock. For five years we have seen the result of the greed, false pride, and selfishness that was the war's antecedents. Every day the press and the radio have brought us graphic accounts of man's "inhumanity to man." So shocking have been the devastating events of the past years, that evil has seemed to far overshow good and we have become almost fearful of life.
At the same time that peace came we realized we were facing a new age a stupendous new age, the fruits of which, when the reactionary forces will be harnessed for man's
destruction or blessing. When the voice of the President of the United States came over the radio announcing the dropping of the atomic bomb with its resulting terrible devastation and loss of life, the first universal reaction was one of fear. "It is a harnessing of the basic powers of the universe," came the voice of the President, and we stood awestruck, fearful. Verily "men's hearts failed them."
"Can truth and goodness triumph?" we ask. "What does the future hold for our children?"
As in the case of the delicate scientific instruments, in times like these man's spiritual nature must be anchored on solid rock. Unless the foundations of our faith are so anchored, the contemporary shocks of world affairs will find us confused and fearful; and our reading of life's scales will be only surface readings and not accurate readings.
The challenging words of our Savior to his disciples can be applied to us. "Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?" And the comforting words, "And this word, Yet once more ... signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken ... that those things which cannot be shaken may remain" (Heb. 12:27).
Our faith, then, assures us that now after the world hurricane has
passed, we shall find that the things of real value have survived. Beauty will remain beauty in earth and sea and sky; beauty in art, music, literature; beauty in character, in life. Truth also will remain. Goodness will survive. God still lives and will guide our destinies if we but let him and are willing to cooperate. We have lost some of our worldly assets, but the real values will carry through. They will survive for all to choose who will.
So the present, instead of making us despondent, should be a
