FAMILY prayers help to keep the family in remembrance of its obligations to and covenants with the Lord. We, as Latter-day Saints, are pledged to "always remember him" that we may always have his spirit to be with us. Families who remember these obligations will not be disobedient to the commandments. They will not be found among the numerous waves of the world; they will not be listed among the Sabbath-breakers, nor among those who violate the Word of Wisdom or the law of chastity. They will not be teaching their children disobedience by holding before them an example of disobedience. Rather, they will be among the stalwarts of the Church, upholding the program of the Church, keeping the commandments and working constantly in the work or stakes.
Family prayer brings into the home the spirit of prayer, and any family which is actuated by the spirit of prayer is actuated by the spirit of God. Persons who leave a house of prayer each morning should carry with them an attitude of good will and fair play, of doing unto others as they would be done by; of righteousness, having a distaste for evil. In that way they may come to understand the meaning in the Savior's words: "Pray always lest ye enter into temptation."
Where family prayers are held in sincerity and humility, the hearts of the members of those families are moved by a desire to be in harmony with the Lord and his servants. Where such a spirit prevails, there is no criticism of the bishop or the stake president, and there is no denunciation of the general authorities, for such criticism is out of harmony with the spirit of prayer. When persons refrain from criticism of the brethren, they resist one of the
apostate tendencies against which the Prophet Joseph has warned us.
Where family prayers are held with devotion, the home is not given over to activities which are opposed to the spirit of prayer. There is no drinking or smoking there, no vile stories, no unchanneled dealings, no lying nor backbiting, nothing unseemly. On the contrary, the home functions are conducted on a high plane where the habits of life are clean. Have you considered what this is worth in the rearing of a family?
It is the desire of the Church to see character built into the souls of
full of faith, devotion, and integrity. Sincere family prayer will help tremendously to bring this about. Can we neglect so great an opportunity?
If we as a people will hold family prayer in our homes with regularity, with faith and humility, and then establish habits of life in keeping with our prayers, the windows of heaven will be opened and such blessings will be poured out upon us that we can hardly contain them. Many of the problems which now vex us will fade away, life will be sweet indeed, and not only will we ourselves be benefited, but we will be as a light upon a hill, a beacon to all mankind. PRAYER Edwin C. Bliss To some, a prayer is mere routine, A boresome obligation. Prosaic offering of thanks. And unfelt adoration. Such praises, sung by grudging lips. Can never reach the throne; For God cares not for prayers made up Of words and words alone. A prayer must be a consecration, Heartfelt and sincere; A faith that, though the load be heavy, God is ever near; A willingness to work and wait As through the years we plod. And place our life entirely Within the hands of God. Shall I Be an Active Member of Relief Society? A Question Which is Vital to Every Woman in the Church Kate M. Barker Former Member Relief Society General Board 
AT the dedication of the science hall on the campus of one of our large universities, a student guide explained to the group he was conducting, "In this room the tables for these sensitive instruments are stone pillars built on solid rock. If we are to get accurate readings it is necessary to have a foundation that goes down below the vibrations, shocks, and jars of the earth's surface."
When the news came of the restoration of peace to the world, we received it with humble, prayerful thanksgiving. For five long years we had prayed for this moment, hoping that if the opportunity were given us again we would build a better world. The war has been a major spiritual shock. For five years we have seen the result of the greed, false pride, and selfishness that was the war's antecedents. Every day the press and the radio have brought us graphic accounts of man's "inhumanity to man." So shocking have been the devastating events of the past years, that evil has seemed to far overshow good and we have become almost fearful of life.
At the same time that peace came we realized we were facing a new age a stupendous new age, the fruits of which, when the reactionary forces will be harnessed for man's
destruction or blessing. When the voice of the President of the United States came over the radio announcing the dropping of the atomic bomb with its resulting terrible devastation and loss of life, the first universal reaction was one of fear. "It is a harnessing of the basic powers of the universe," came the voice of the President, and we stood awestruck, fearful. Verily "men's hearts failed them."
"Can truth and goodness triumph?" we ask. "What does the future hold for our children?"
As in the case of the delicate scientific instruments, in times like these man's spiritual nature must be anchored on solid rock. Unless the foundations of our faith are so anchored, the contemporary shocks of world affairs will find us confused and fearful; and our reading of life's scales will be only surface readings and not accurate readings.
The challenging words of our Savior to his disciples can be applied to us. "Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?" And the comforting words, "And this word, Yet once more ... signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken ... that those things which cannot be shaken may remain" (Heb. 12:27).
Our faith, then, assures us that now after the world hurricane has
passed, we shall find that the things of real value have survived. Beauty will remain beauty in earth and sea and sky; beauty in art, music, literature; beauty in character, in life. Truth also will remain. Goodness will survive. God still lives and will guide our destinies if we but let him and are willing to cooperate. We have lost some of our worldly assets, but the real values will carry through. They will survive for all to choose who will.
So the present, instead of making us despondent, should be a challenge. Surely we are thanking our Heavenly Father today more gratefully than ever for the gospel and for his Church. Surely now more than ever our testimonies seem priceless, and we are resolved that their foundations must go deeper and deeper until "surface shocks" of life cannot weaken them. Now we know that the thing we desire above all else for our children is a testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ, a testimony so strong that it will be the motivating force always in their lives, a testimony and faith anchored so deeply and solidly that it will stand against all life's storms.
The use to which these tremendous forces which have been harnessed will be put, will depend on us. It will take intelligence. Such an age as we are facing demands strong people, a people who have faith in God, in mankind, and in man's destiny. We realize that the world is going to be filled with confusion, problems, and great demands.
No generation of women has ever faced greater responsibility. The home must be the nucleus for the better world; and the home cannot
be protected by merely negative ethics you must not do this, you must not do that. We must build a more definite, constructive faith in the basic, eternal, guiding principles of life. We must know as never before the divine plans for our happiness and welfare. Surely, the women of the Church, having faced the horrors of the war years, are resolved that henceforth their homes shall be built on the solid foundation of faith and, having seen the world suffering from so much that is false and ugly, are resolved that, insofar as they are able to control, only truth shall enter the home such truth as gives beauty to life and dignity to mankind and to human relationships.
WOMAN has a great responsibility in setting standards and maintaining the spiritual and cultural level of the home and community. Our Father in heaven, knowing our needs to meet this responsibility, has been kind to the women of the Church. He has given them an organization of their own in which they can seek all those things that are "virtuous, lovely, and of good report" as the Prophet said, "according to their natures." We do not learn best by ourselves added understanding, added appreciation comes with contact with the ideas and experiences of others.
The knowledge most worthwhile is certainly an understanding of the greatest needs of the beauty in the gospel, which is God's plan for our happiness. We could study all the greatest literature and no doubt never new beauty would unfold. As our knowledge and testimony increase, life takes on new meaning and beauty.
Our Relief Society gives us the opportunity of a course of study that has been prayerfully planned and as broad as life itself spiritual, cultural, practical. We can be sure that only truth is contained therein, that everything given is worthwhile. Facts alone may be cold, but when interpreted in the light of the gospel, they take on glorious meanings. Our Relief Society teaching is done in "the light of the gospel."
Today, we must seek our happiness in a world where experiences, in a variety of ways, are continually attacking our faith and menacing our homes and our chances for a satisfying life. The modern tempo is characterized by an acid type of cynicism which does not believe that anything in the world is worthy of our serious allegiance. When people feel this way, not only marriage ties but all human relationships lose value, and life loses its sense of direction. And yet in every human soul is a longing for loyalty to something outside ourselves. The dictators have capitalized on this innate longing in their appeal to the young. "Cynicism is defeatism applied to ideals." We can best be protected from it by the atmosphere of a loyal group working together for worthy ends.
So, active membership, loyalty to the Church is the finest safeguard against this defeatism, and all the resultant things that are cheap and shallow. The lack of intense loyalties to worthy causes is one of the great spiritual losses of modern times. Most parents desire greatly that their children belong to and feel a loyalty to their Church organization; yet, sometimes to us, we that the things they say and do, the
loyalties they show, forge themselves into a pattern for their children, and children are influenced most by those whom they love most.
Moreover, seeing is believing. We of the older generation whose parents or grandparents sacrificed so much to be true to the Church, have a background whose influence can seldom be entirely lost. We may become inactive and apparently indifferent for awhile, and then in later life repent. But what about our children who have seen only our disloyalties? President George Albert Smith, in a recent talk in Bonneville Stake, told the story of the son of one of our brethren who drifted away from all Church activity. In later life he realized what he was missing and returned to the Church, but found that his interest in the Church or its ideals could be aroused in his children. As President Smith said, "He could repent but he could not repent for his children." In the fine lives of our children is our greatest joy, and in their failure is our greatest sorrow, especially when we realize that some fault of our own has contributed to that failure.
We can be no greater than our loyalties. The women of the Church have a divinely organized, divinely guided organization which is deserving of their greatest loyalty.
FRIENDSHIP is one of the finest spiritual experiences and one of the greatest needs of the human soul. We find strength in companionship. Loss of sincere, loyal friendships has been another of the spiritual losses in our superficial, material-minded, modern age. Relief Society offers the opportunity for building close, warm, sincere friendships with women who will share their courage, vision and faith with us. The world is crying for greater understanding sincere friendships. We of the Church must demonstrate that true friendship can be had that groups of women can organize work together, study together, in understanding and sympathy the joy of one bringing joy to all, the sorrow of one bringing sorrow to all, the reputation of each being the concern of all. Spiritual life flourishes in such deeply knit groups. The Prophet Joseph Smith, when organizing Relief Society, promised, "If you live up to your privileges, the angels cannot be restrained from being your associates." Are we missing this great blessing because of lack of unity and because of the apathy of some to sense their responsibilities? What great spiritual benefit, what great strength to the Church would surely come if, in every ward, all the women were united in such groups!
Adults do not grow unless they serve. The opportunities for service in Relief Society are many. Someone has said that in service one and one are more than two but two together can accomplish more than two working alone. There is power in united effort, though the individual contribution may be small, yet if each does his share a few hours, what a wonderful contribution their united efforts make to the great Church Welfare Plan. Our little becomes part of a great whole.
The average attendance at Relief Society meetings is low. There is too often the feeling that absence from meetings affects only the members who absent themselves, that
ization can never realize its highest potentialities until every woman senses her responsibility, that there is an influence, a spirit, an interest and enthusiasm which the alone can give, that there is a definite plan and need for her at each meeting.
An unusual custom is observed in a small English country chapel at evening services. At the end of each pew is a candlestick. When the family is not constantly uses that pew is ushered in, the candle is lighted. When the family is not present the pew remains dark. When we are absent from meeting our place remains dark.
To every woman of the Church our Father in heaven has given the opportunities that come in Relief Society, and every woman has the responsibility for the success of the organization. As members of the Church we must choose opportunities and responsibilities are ours. There can be no question as to that. The only question is, will each one of us gratefully seize these opportunities, and will each one of us gladly accept our responsibilities?
Today, there are many avenues of activity for women outside the home. But we have limited time and energy we must choose wisely and spend it well. It seems especially true of mothers that there is often confusion when they leave home, unless some responsible person can make for the children the little while she is away. Every woman needs mental stimulus, spiritual enrichment, friendly associates. How necessary it is that we get our values straight that our life's perspective be right and that we attend our activities accordingly. The hours spent in Relief Society are not hours selfishly spent. We put our market basket on our arm, as it were, and go forth to obtain food, spiritual food, to share with the family.
IT is therefore vital that every woman in the Church should ask herself the question, "Shall I be active in Relief Society?" Each one should get her values straight and answer fairly.
Why Should I?
Because I want a living, growing testimony of the gospel and an understanding of woman's nature. The Relief Society lessons and discussions help me in this understanding.
Because I want to continue my education along the lines I most need. Relief Society offers an educational course which as the Prophet said is "according to woman's nature."
Because I want intellectual and spiritual contacts with women of like ideals. Relief Society offers me these contacts.
Because I need sincere friendships. Relief Society offers me the opportunity for forming such friendships.
Because I want to get all the truth and beauty I can. I want life to be meaningful. Everything offered in Relief Society is worthwhile.
Because I need help in being a homemaker. Relief Society gives this help.
Because I want to be associated with an organization deserving my greatest loyalty. Relief Society, divinely organized and divinely directed, is worthy of my greatest loyalty.
Because I am thankful for the blessings the Church has brought me, I will show my appreciation by my activity. I want happiness and satisfaction in life. Our Father in heaven has told us to meet together often as sisters. I will follow his advice.
Because I wish to serve. In Relief Society my little becomes a part of a great service.
Because I have the opportunity of joining an organization which, in origin and nature, is different from all other women's organizations.
Because I want to face life eagerly and courageously, my faith, my loyalties must be so firmly anchored that I can read life's values accurately.
These are but a few of the answers that come so probably our question should not be, "Shall I be an active member in Relief Society?" but, "Can I afford not to be an active member?" CHALLENGE Mabel Jones Gabhott These words He gave to man, His challenge, rich and true; "Love one another. Even as I love you." The Bottom Drawer Ruby Scranton Jones MAJEL hurried home as soon as school was out. It was Wednesday, the day Bart's letter came, and the thought of it had made her day bright. Yes, there it was on the hall table where Grandma always put it. She carried it to her room and began to read. She smiled at the salutation, "My darling little Sweetheart," but soon frowned as she read, "There'll be three weddings right after graduation. Why not make it four? Please, don't say 'no.' It's what I want most in the world. I'll have two weeks' leave and then I report at a field on Long Island for three months' bomber training. We could be sure of that much time together, at least." Majel sat in her little rocker, the letter in her lap. What was Bart thinking of? He must know a teacher couldn't run off that way without giving notice. Then there was Grandma. What would she do? Just then Grandma stopped in the doorway. "What's the matter, Honey," she asked. Majel looked up into the wise old blue eyes so like her own young ones. "Bart wants me to come to Texas and marry him next Wednesday. He should know I can't do that." "Of course not," Grandma said indignantly. "Such haste wouldn't be decent." "But how to tell him, that's what bothers me." Majel took up the letter and started to read again. "Scold him good for suggesting Page 588 such a thing." The little old lady dismissed the problem with a shrug. But it wasn't so simple as that. Majel and Bart had gone together since high school days. She had worn his fraternity pin since they had been juniors in the university. They had planned their life together in long, earnest talks. They knew just what kind of house they would build to accommodate the hoped for children. Always there had been a place for Grandma in their plans. When war came Bart became a pilot, not a lawyer, and they decided they would not marry until the war was over. All evening Majel worked on her answer. She explained what the principal had said about the disloyalty of teachers who left to make more money or to get married, and how she had promised to finish out the year. She told how Grandma had had several heart attacks and could not be left alone. She wrote the letter over and over but the last version sounded no more convincing than the first. Wednesday, Majel sent a telegram of congratulation to Bart. She had no letter that day but, of course, she thought, Bart would have been too busy to write. And then on Saturday she heard that Bart was home home without letting her know so she could meet him. Why would he do that, she wondered, when we haven't seen each other for nine months? He must know this is as hard for me as it is for him. SUNDAY, Majel did not go to church. She wanted to be home when Bart called. She spent an hour arranging her soft black curls in the even rows he liked. She put on a new blue suit and then changed to a rose wool dress that he had said he hoped would never wear out. And still there was no call. At last she went to her room and sat staring out the window.
After dark, when she had almost given up hope, the bell rang and Bart was there. He said, "Hello," as though nothing had happened and kissed her on the cheek.
"Lieutenant Winters," she said, stepping back to look at him. "How you do set off that uniform." She touched the gold bar on his shoulder. "And how tanned you are. Or is it that your hair has bleached in the Texas sun?"
"A little of both," he said, following her into the living room.
She wanted desperately to throw her arms around him and tell him how proud she was, but the unusual coolness of his manner restrained her.
Just then Grandma hurried in. She pulled down his head and kissed him. "Bad boy," she said. "Surely you wouldn't want Majel to be one of those war brides."
"Well," he said flushing, "we've been engaged long enough, haven't we?"
"What kind of marriage would that be?" She shook her finger at him. "You've plenty of time. Why, Majel's not twenty and you're only twenty-one. You're just children." She went out, leaving them laughing but annoyed.
"Oh, Bart," Majel said as he sat down beside her. "You must see
that I couldn't break a contact. Teachers are impossible to replace and I promised to stay." She turned to look at him but he wouldn't meet her eyes. "And I just couldn't leave Grandma when she's not well." Still he didn't speak. "Don't you see, Bart, I just couldn't do it?" Her tone was pleading now.
"No, I don't. You've always said marriage meant more to you than anything else." His voice rose in anger. "Now you say a job is more important or your Grandmother." When Majel tried to speak, he hurried on, "I want you to be my wife before I have to go. Is it too much to expect?" He got up to pace back and forth, his gray eyes stormy.
MAJEL reached out to stop him, but he stepped aside. "Bart, dear," she said, "you know how I love you and how much I want to be your wife. But what kind of marriage would that be for either of us? I wouldn't be happy because I would feel guilty, and you wouldn't be happy feeling you had persuaded me to do something wrong. We've got to plan for all the years ahead, not just for three months."
"Yes, and while you're planning, I'll be out there fighting and probably getting killed."
"Don't, Bart, don't." She covered her face with her hands.
Bart stopped in front of her. "Well, marry me then if you care so much."
"There are so m many reasons why I can't," she sobbed.
Bart snatched up his cap and started for the door. Then he turned. "I might have known it was that bottom drawer you cared for," he accused, "and not me." He went out and slammed the door. Majel sat a long time thinking. How could this have happened to her and Bart who loved each other so much. And what was it he had said about her "bottom drawer?" Majel had been left' an orphan when she was six and had come to live with her father's mother. The old lady had kept the little gid from being too lonely by telling her stories of Ireland. The one most sure to interest her was about the Irish girls who set aside the bottom drawers of their dressers for their hope chests. So Grandma had taught her all kinds of needlework and together they had crocheted doilies, embroidered towels, hemmed napkins, and wrapped them in blue tissue and put them away in the bottom drawer of the old dresser. As the years passed, under this influence, she had come to look upon marriage as the sole interest of her life. When Barton Winters moved to their town and began to show his preference for her, Majel accepted him as the fulfilment of all her dreams. And then her bottom drawer held an added interest. She worked vacations to buy the finest sheets and pillow cases to monogram. She pieced quilts of intricate pattern, crocheted a bedspread, and lastly learned how to weave a tablecloth as dainty as a spider web. The bottom drawer had long ago become an overflowing cedar chest. She had told Bart about it as he watched her sew in the evenings they spent at home. He had shown pride in her work. "My little housewife," he had said, "my little old-fashioned girl." But tonight, Majel thought, he had not been proud of her. He had been disappointed and angry like one of the little boys she taught. "DART came back the next evening and apologized. He laughed it off and took her to a movie. Tuesday evening she wanted to stay at home but Bart said they should go calling. Wednesday, they decided to have a real party with dinner and dancing at the hotel. For the first time since his return, Bart seemed natural and happy. They had given their order and Bart had just said, "Let's try this dance," when Milly Andrews, a girl they had known in school, came in with another officer. When she saw Bart she hurried over. "Hello, handsome," she said. "Why didn't you let your friends know?" She nodded to Majel and introduced her escort. "Why can't we sit here, too?" she asked, so Bart drew out a chair for her and they all sat down. All through the university, Milly had made no secret of her liking for Bart. When the orchestra started a particularly snappy tune she said, "Oh, Bart, that's ours," and jumped up. Bart looked at Majel with raised eyebrows, so she nodded. There seemed nothing else to do. Lieutenant Jackson turned to Majel. "Do you mind not dancing?" he asked. "I'm hardly up to it. I'm just out of the hospital." For the first time Majel looked closely. At him and noticed how pale he was. "Of course not," she answered. "It's too fast for me anyway." With her usual kindliness she set about to entertain him, but with half her mind she kept thinking, why, Milly would marry him tomorrow if he asked her. THE BOTTOM DRAWER 591 When the dance was over, more friends came in, so they pushed two tables together and the evening became a reception for Bart. Majel enjoyed the repartee, the dancing, two things she had missed while Bart was away. He was very attentive and she soon forgot the unhappy incident which had threatened to spoil the evening. At midnight Majel stood up. "Fm sorry," she said, "but I have to work tomorrow." "Oh, yes," Milly laughed, "the little school-teacher." Her voice showed plainly the scorn in which she held the whole profession. "Why don't you take her home, Bart, and then come back?" "I guess not," he said as he held Majel s coat. "I d just be extra." "An extra man's not to be sneezed at these days." Milly shook her blond bob becomingly. All the way home Majel kept thinking, why couldn't we have had the evening to ourselves. I might have been able to explain things. I might have been able to convince him. She lay awake a long time wondering if Bart had gone back to the hotel. Should she be more demonstrative? Should she try to make Bart jealous? It would have been so easy with Lieutenant Jackson. No, no matter what happened to her she would never be like Milly. But should she forget her scruples and offer to marry him? What could a nice girl do to hold the man she loved? On Bart's last evening he was having dinner with Majel and her Grandmother, when Mary Stuart, an old friend, came in. She was incoherent with excitement but they finally gathered that she was leaving the next day to marry a man she had met the summer before and seen but twice since. "But, Mary, you hardly know him," Majel said in shocked surprise. "And how could you live on a private's pay?" "Why, I know him better than Fve ever known anyone," Mary answered indignantly. "And as for living, Fll get a job. A stenographer can get work anywhere." OART got up from the table and patted her shoulder. "Good girl," he said. "You're doing exactly right. If you want him, better grab him before some other girl does." Mary smiled and said "Thanks. That's the first good word I've heard." Majel thought, that's what he really believes. That's how he wants me to be. He can't see the difference between Mary's problem and mine. Bart left early because he was taking a midnight plane and he didn't suggest that Majel see him off. He kissed her and told her that he would write soon. She might have been just any girl he had taken out a few times. She cried when he was gone because the ten days had been such a failure. He knew, of course, that school would be out in three months, and the chief obstacle to their marriage removed, but he hadn't mentioned it. And he hadn't given her a ring. Of course, she still had his fraternity pin but a ring seemed so much more definite. She couldn't sleep, so she got up (Continued on page 613) The Fight Against Infantile Paralysis Must Continue Frank S. Emery Utah State Representative, National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis  POLIOMYELITIS, commonly known as infantile paralysis, is caused by a virus, infinitesimally small, which lives on the nerve cells of the living body. The future activity of the victim depends upon the extent these nerve cells are affected.
Now, when we think of an epidemic, most of us are beset by fear that drives all reason from us and causes us to say and do things that, on sober thought, we never would do. With any sickness, it is wise to be careful and clean, but, with any sickness, it is foolish to become panicky. Poliomyelitis is a contagious disease, but, according to our present knowledge, it is not nearly so contagious as previously assumed. However, under our statutes, a polio patient must be isolated during the acute period so that he will not expose others to this serious infection.
It is believed by the medical profession that poliomyelitis virus is transmitted by common vectors or carriers. Dr. John R. Paul, an epidemician at the University of Utah, who has had considerable experience in epidemics, states that a survey which he made indicates that in the 1945 epidemic were traceable to four hundred cases reported during of contracting the disease through
direct contact is much less likely than formerly supposed.
However, there are now hundreds of victims of infantile paralysis who need care and attention from trained personnel, and hundreds more this year will swell the ranks of those afflicted with this dread disease. Early diagnosis and specialized care are essential to the well-being of a polio patient.
Physiotherapy is now a must in the treatment of poliomyelitis. Under the direction of competent physicians, physiotherapists are helping patients to recover from this disease and assisting crippled victims to do the things which heretofore have been regarded as impossible. Through the efforts of our medical men and women, hundreds of boys and girls, who might have been hopelessly handicapped, now have the use of their arms and legs, and, from all appearances, are normal men and women.
Technicians must be recruited and trained without delay. To this end, the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis has outlined a program for the recruiting and training of physiotherapists who will be available at the call of qualified physicians.
The Foundation has set aside the sum of $1,267,600 to be used for training men and women in the art of physiotherapy. These scholarships are now making it possible for people interested in the healing arts to acquire not only a dignified and lucrative profession, but also to become of immeasurable help to their fellow men. The National Foundation is very anxious that these scholarships be used.
The field is not limited to the treatment of poliomyelitis, but similar methods of treatment are being used in practically every branch of medical science. As our knowledge of diseases and their cause progresses, the need for physiotherapists becomes more obvious.
Scholarships for nine to twelve months' training at approved schools of physical education, covering expenses, books, and transportation, according to the needs of qualified students. Candidates for this specialized instruction must be capable of classification within one or more of the following groups:
(a) Graduates of approved schools of physical education.
(b) Graduates of schools of nursing.
(c) Students who have completed two or more years of college work, including twelve semester hours in biology and the basic sciences.
Anyone interested in these scholarships should communicate with the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, Inc., 120 Broadway, New York City 5, New York, or, more directly, with the local state or county chapter.
For the hundreds who are now being helped by the limited force of properly trained nurses and aides, thousands of the healing arts are needed. There are not enough trained people
care for those now afflicted and the many others who will undoubtedly contract the disease in future epidemics.
In the treatment of poliomyelitis, the application of hot-packs from the beginning is now an essential process. These hot-packs, depending upon the condition of the patient, must be applied from four to twelve times a day. In case of an epidemic, we do not have enough trained people to do this work.
There are many women who lack the educational requirements and the time necessary for becoming professional physiotherapists. These women may help in the fight against infantile paralysis by training themselves as aids in the nursing profession. In this way many mothers and many future mothers may learn the healing arts of hot-pack application and bedside nursing.
There is only one center in Utah offering proper training for nurse' aids in the treatment of poliomyelitis at the present time. A program has been outlined whereby each county will send to Salt Lake City at least three women for a tentative intensive course in hot-packing and beside nursing of infantile paralysis victims. Several competent and experienced physicians, assisted by various social service and nursing groups, will supervise this essential training. The expenses of the women will be carried by the auxiliary chapters of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis which have been organized in every county in Utah. Living quarters will be provided. When these women have completed their training, they will be asked, under the direction of the county medical authorities, to organize classes and train other women to be prepared in case of an emergency. Remember the needs of our children. Volunteer in the service of the healing arts. No mother knows when the dread poliomyelitis may strike one of her own children. If she has had training in the essential nursing procedures, a mother may render her child a service that might not otherwise be available. If you are unable to get in touch with your local chapter officers, contact the State Representative, Room 250, Union Pacific Annex, 19 West South Temple Street, Salt Lake City 1, Utah, or telephone 3-3126. Let us go forward in the fight against disease. Let us protect our children and care for them. It is today that we must prepare for the emergencies of tomorrow. "FOLLOW ME" Rose Thomas Graham As Jesus walked with men along The shores of Galilee, There must have been a little child Who played there by the sea. As Jesus, standing on the Mount, Taught men, whose hearts were stirred, There must have been a little child Who hearkened to his word. As Jesus struggled up the hill Beneath his heavy load, There must have "been a little child Who stumbled on the road. As Marys gathered round the tomb Where their Lord Jesus lay, There must have been a little child Who knelt alone to pray. Our Public Buildings Howard Barker Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds, Salt Lake City Schools THE other day a five-year-old boy was "helping" his uncle with some carpenter work. The plane, Yankee drill, and other tools were very attractive. Without any preliminary discussion of the line of thought, the lad said, "When you die, can I have these tools?" His experience of the past two years in losing a father and grandmother had taught him that things outlive people. " This might be called axiom number one in our evaluation of public buildings. Axiom number two follows very logically: of all the works of man, public buildings are among the most enduring. In spite of the disintegration of time and the elements, and even of world wars, the pyramids of Egypt, St. Peter's in Rome, the leaning tower in Pisa, and countless other structures built many generations ago are still with us. But how valuable are our public buildings? NORTH AND SOUTH EIGHTEENTH WARD, ENSIGN STAKE, SALT LAKE CITY Chapel Built 1901 Page  Are they worth maintaining in good condition? Or, is it less expensive in the long run to do. as many of us have done with our automobiles, get as much use out of them as we can for a short time and then turn them in on new ones? Some of our public buildings have been designed and built to last and serve a long time. Examples of this type in Salt Lake City are the temple, the Utah State Capitol, and the L. D. S. Church Administration Building. These can be expected to be practically as valuable after a hundred years as when they were built. They will require relatively low maintenance expenditures and they are not likely to suffer rapidly from obsolescence. They are examples of axiom number three: the better the construction, the less the cost oi maintenance. But let's talk about the average church, or school, or library, or city hall. When most of these were built their builders were probably thinking in terms of a useful life of about forty or fifty years. Many of these structures are well past that age. But, since they have been maintained fairly well, they are worth more dollars today than when built. Worth more dollars today? That's a pretty strong statement. But if it is true, Our buildings are certainly worth maintaining at a high standard. What are the facts? The present worth of a building can be fairly accurately determined if we know three things: (1) the year in which it was built, (2) its original cost, and (3) a logical estimate of its depreciation. For example, $42 bought as much in 1890 as did $100 in 1926, or as did $127 in 1944. Putting it another way, each $100 worth of building in 1890 is now worth about $302, or each $100 worth in 1926 is now worth about $127. That is, this would be the relationship if we neglect depreciation. But suppose the 1890 building should now be depreciated by fifty per cent. It would still be worth about one and a half times as much today as when built. We can then state axiom number four: buildings become worth more as the purchasing power of the dollar declines. Now as to depreciation. There are two major factors: wear and tear due to use and the elements, and obsolescence. Both of these factors can be largely overcome by replacing worn parts and by functional remodeling to meet current needs  To give an idea of the relationship of depreciation costs to total building valuations, the values for the Salt Lake City school district might be interesting. There are now about fifty buildings, having a total 1945 valuation of about $11,500,000. Many of these buildings are now more than fifty years old. But, due to lower construction costs when they were built as compared to now, and to the consistent spending of maintenance money for the improvement or replacement of floors, roofs, heating, plumbing, ventilating and lighting equipment, etc., practically all of these buildings are worth more dollars today than when they were erected. The total maintenance cost for a fifty-five year period has averaged about $1.25 per $100 valuation per year. In this connection, however, it should be kept in mind that the valuations used for this comparison have been based on annual appraisals of present value which take into account variations in construction costs, and also as accurate depreciation data as are available. ST. GEORGE STAKE TABERNACLE, ST. GEORGE, UTAH Built in   What about deferred maintenance? When a building needs painting, repairing, or the replacement of any part, nothing can be saved by waiting. In fact, deferred maintenance will not only increase the ultimate maintenance cost, but will eventually wipe out the capital investment. There's an old saying that When you need a thing you pay for it whether you buy it or not." Let's list that as axiom number six. Its author must have had a life-long experience maintaining buildings. Our discussion thus far has all been on the logic of maintaining our public buildings from the standpoint of economics. The facts overwhelmingly indicate that as long as a building is worth using it is worth maintaining. We cannot afford otherwise. But there is another point. Our buildings are our children inanimate, yes but we have created them. Our care of them is a pretty good index of how we live and how we think. Enter a strange house by the back door, and by the time you have reached the kitchen you will know what the living room will look like. Or, walk into the boiler room of a public building and you will know the custodian (and maybe the fellow the custodian works for). Yes, our public buildings are built to be used and enjoyed. In their planning and construction let us seek the best architectural and building talent available. Harmony of mass, color, and line can typify our culture and our hopes. FOURTEENTH WARD, SALT LAKE STAKE, SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH Chapel Built in 1857 Good quality materials and workmanship can indicate our stability and our wisdom. But only good care can prove our thrift and our appreciation of the fine things of life. And, in the final analysis, this appreciation is measured in terms of such simple things as a broom, some soup, a hammer, a plane, a Yankee drill, a bucket of paint and a will to do.  Yes, Sonny, you can have my tools when I die, but remember, we can build a building in a year, but we have to take care of it for a century.  OCTOBER MAGIC Jeanette P. Parry October, the roving gypsy. Is here in my garden again, With scarfs of exotic color To tie on the hillside and glen. The valley wears a grape-blue veil, To hide the sadness in her heart; It is hard to see October go And with her jocund spirit part. Through dreamy, shifting, opal days The river dons a silver coat, And hosts of gold and crimson leaves Upon its placid surface float. The sun climbs down the autumn sky And leaves a flame-like afterglow, Soon winter's biting winds may sweep Across the frozen wastes of snow. Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, October 1, and October 15, 1885 "For the Rights of the Women of Zion and the Rights of the Women OF All Nations" GIRLS, DON'T MISTAKE BRASS FOR GOLD: The bestowal of the affections of a woman is a strange subject, perhaps, to dilate upon, but one which, in my estimation, should be dwelt upon and discussed far more than it has hitherto been, for by the bestowal may come joy and happiness, or woe and heartache. Who would wish for shadow when she could have sunshine?... Then why should we not be more wise and discreet in the choice of a husband, when, by the selection, may come life-long sorrow, tears, and wishes for an early grave.... Then we should be careful not to mistake brass for gold... To be sure that we have the real, genuine metal; then we are more confident of happiness. Ida. RESPONSE Love on! Love on!

Itis dated August 22nd, 1846, my eighteenth birthday, and had been preserved among father's papers: Now I shall require these things at your hands... Cease from vanity, seek humility and meekness, bow before the Lord in the morning and at eve, and in so doing your days may be many, peace and tranquility shall soothe your bosoms, health and happiness shall dwell in thy wagons, tents, wigwams and cottages, while these things are observed. Cease from murmuring or complaining, finding fault with your friend or with each other, but manifest to all men and women, by your works and the closeness of your tongues, and the integrity of your hearts, that you are right, and that God is with us of a truth. I always do, and shall expect that those which constitute my house, will remember me before the Lord, that I may have wisdom, health, patience, endurance... That I may always give suitable counsel to my family. Heber C. Kimball.  Helen Mar (Kimball) Whitney. A GOOD TESTIMONY: Fault-finding does not enhance our peace of mind, and it almost invariably disturbs that of those we most desire to promote.

VOL. 32 OCTOBER 1945 NO. 10 ?Comfort Ye MY People? Isaiah 40:1 WORLD War II has ended. With the reported cessation of hostilities in Japan and the Far East, once more the healing wings of peace are enfolding the world. And, although many of the fighting forces still remain far from their native hearthstones, the comforting assurance has come to their loved ones that no longer are they called upon to face the horrors and destruction of a total war. The year A. D. 1945 will ever mark the close of an old era?one of sorrow and grief for the mothers of men?and the beginning of a new era. The unleashing of a new force in the final phase of the war, whose future power either for good or evil seems to be incalculable, foreshadows the new world era. If the inhabitants of the earth turn to righteousness, and this power is harnessed and developed for the good of man, its future use may prove a blessing to humanity In the hands of wicked and ungodly men, however, the development of this new force, as evidenced in the action of the atomic bomb, may result in the utter destruction of the human race. Such a supposition recalls to the minds of Latter-day Saints the words of the Lord: For I, the Almighty, have laid my hands upon the nations, to scourge them for their Page 602 wickedness. And plagues shall go forth, and they shall not be taken from the earth until I have completed my work, which shall be cut short in righteousness (Doc. And Gov. 84:96-97). May the prayers of the righteous ascend upward in ceaseless supplication that a spirit of righteousness may abide in the hearts of mankind. The assurance of peace at this time brings a spirit of joy and thanksgiving to Relief Society members throughout the world. Faithfully and well through these past years have they carried on the work of the Society. With their own hearts torn and their sensibilities at times harrowed up almost beyond endurance, they have continued to meet together, oftimes under difficult conditions, to relieve the distress of the less fortunate and to mingle their fears, doubts, hopes, and even tears, in a closeness of spirit. They have added to their ability to carry on from the truths of the gospel they have been taught and from increasing the strength of their testimonies. Those women whose wounds will never entirely heal, who have been called upon to bear the supreme loss of a loved father, husband, or son, unselfishly rejoice in the happiness of their sisters and the blessings still remaining to them. With the removal, of the terrible anxiety which has oppressed the EDITORIAL 603 spirits of the women of the Church, and with restrictions on meetings lifted, there must come to Relief Society a great upwelling and resurgence of power. The future lies ahead unknown, but all the calls that may come to the Society will be met if members answer every call made upon them as individuals. Each day the Church Welfare Plan broadens and deepens. The part of Relief Society women in this Plan is great. The responsibility of the Society in saving souls by teaching and living the gospel, is also great. Only by a rededication by the women of the Church?the young ones as well as the older ones?to the work of Relief Society will it be able to fulfill its destiny in the years ahead. Endowed with the grace of humble hearts and contrite spirits, the women of the Church everywhere will work together?for only through their magnificent, united accomplishments will the unbounded potentialities of Relief Society be realized. And the righteousness of the daughters of Zion will be pleasing unto the Lord. M. C. S. THE fall time, the waning of the year, to some people foreshadows a season of dryness and decay, to be followed by the blanketing numbness of winter. So it appeared to the poet Bryant who lamented: The melancholy days are come, the saddest of the year; Of wailing winds and naked woods, and meadows brown and sere. To such people the fall seems a dread season, a time of regret and heartache, of farewell to happy, carefree days, and a time to shoulder the burdens which are waiting. The word "fall" itself connotes a time of decline, an ebbing away of the fulness, a gradual withdrawing of pulsating life which leaves behind but a hardened shell, an empty husk, and a baren waste. To others, the third quarter of the year is best described by the term new ?John Banister Tabb "autumn," an uncertain time, typifying the unpredictable, the colorful, whirling, restless season of the year when activities which have been slumbering in the hot, languorous days of summer are revived; when the blood quickens in tempo with the biting winds without, and energy and spirit are renewed. The keen expectancy of a new school year with friendships and pleasures still untested, seems to pervade the very air. The snatching of unlearned books, the rushing out to meet playmates, the boisterous chatter of children, gaily attired in plaids and brilliant sweaters to match the kaleidoscopic colors of the foliage, punctuates the stillness of the morning. The noontide quiet is shattered by the calls of the released boys and girls who run home, sniffing and exclaiming over the sharpness of pepper-red chili sauce, the acrid tang of pickles or the cloying sweetness of preserves, and the unforgettable odor of freshly baked bread. The dancing leaves outside the kitchen door cast a living applique of shadow over the luncheon scene. Tempting samples from bottles whose contents are to be more fully enjoyed in the long months ahead, make these occasions ones to be cherished and recalled in future years. Such sunny, bright days may be interrupted by days of winds and rain, when the family gathers in close companionship around a crackling grate fire, and gratitude wells up in the hearts of the surrounding half circle for the plenty and security found within the beloved home. And after such days of blustery rains and squalls comes a ring of days, each one a jewel reflecting russet, saffron, taffeta tans or tawny orange, with here and there the glowing red of the sumac on the hill, all set in a gleaming band of maple gold. The season of all seasons?Indian summer. Then, as the days grow short and night shadows lengthen, the blaze of color painted by the Master Artist is swept away by the mighty brush of winds, and the mind comes to accept the changelessness of changes?of the season, moods, and circumstances. Over the glory of the beauty that was autumn imperceptibly but surely steals the gaunt, stark beauty of the winter. One is. Led to acknowledge the hand of the Lord over all in the inevitableness and lightness of the changes that enter into the lives of his children, as in the seasons, and to accept, with thankfulness, the sorrows, as well as the joys, of mortality. M. C. S. AN UNWEEDED GARDEN Caroline Eyring Miner How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable, Seems to me all the uses of this world! Fie on't! Oh fie, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature Possess it merely. That it should come to this! Were these lines written in 1945, before the end of the war? No, but they might have been as far as their application is concerned, and yet they were penned by the hand of Shakespeare in the sixteenth century. Unbelievable, do I hear you say, that our mechanized and scientific world should have come from that unweeded garden of the sixteenth century? And yet it did. On the same foundation, may we not hope that four hundred years from now it will seem unbelievable to our descendants that out of the economic and social chaos of 1945, the idealistic order of that day could have come? Nevertheless, I believe it will be said. NOTES TO THE FIELD Relief Society Singing Activities Encouraged IT is gratifying to know that, despite these strenuous times, so many of the Relief Society singing groups have remained intact and have been able to keep their membership and often have increased it. We realize that due to the restrictive conditions that have been brought about because of the war this has not been possible in some areas.
The General Board appreciates the fine leadership and effort that have been put into the organizations of the Singing Mothers and that have made them distinctive and valuable.
Those who participate in these singing groups receive many cultural benefits as well as rendering worthy service to the Relief Society and
to the Church in general. This was definitely emphasized by our beloved President Grant in the following lines:
The singing of our sacred hymns written by the servants of God has a powerful effect in converting people to the principles of the gospel and in promoting peace and spiritual growth. Singing is a prayer to the Lord, as He has said: "For any soul delighteth in the song of the heart: yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads."
We therefore hope that every Relief Society member who is able to sing will affiliate herself with these singing groups and receive the blessings and inspiration of such endeavor.

Her hair unkempt, and 'round her feet Summer's useless clutter. * She dresses in a tawny red, Gypsy-gay, and bright. Spurning pastel shades of spring And winter's pristine white.

Page 605 And For Eternity Olive Woolley Burt CHAPTER V SYNOPSIS Delsa Marriott, who has not divulged the fact that her fiance, Hugh Temple, wants to break their engagement, is condemned by the townsfolk for what they consider an unseemly interest in Jeff Holden. In order to show them that Jeff means nothing to her, and yet save her face in the affair with Hugh, Delsa decides to appear captivated by Alec Windsor, a marine visiting Delsa's friend, Jim Lewis. THE whole town was excited over Jim's and Lina's wedding. No one was so small, so unimportant, that he didn't have a part in the preparations that now went forward. Jim and Lina were to go to Salt Lake City on Thursday and be married in the temple. Then they would return home, and that evening a big reception would be given for them. Not only was the whole town invited?but the whole valley, as well. Friends and relatives from far and near would gather in the ward amusement hall to wish the young couple happiness, and to dance and eat. "It's going to be a real, old-fashioned wedding," Lina told Delsa happily. "Dad and Mother think it would be nice to have a get-together like they used to have, years ago. In spite of rationing, some of the women think they can get up a good, hot meal. There'll be dancing and a program?everyone who wants to take part on the program can." Delsa smiled. "I wonder if you know what you're Page 606 letting yourself in for?" she asked. 'Tve heard Mother tell of those old-time affairs?they lasted a good part of the night. You'll be tired after the day in Salt Lake?going through the temple and all." "I don't care!" Lina said, "if Mother and Dad and Jim's folks want an old-time party again, we'll give it to them. We've been so sober for so long. We're going to be happy and all together again for once!" Talk of the wedding even permeated the schoolroom and grounds. Nellie Gibson was learning a recitation to say at Lina's wedding, and the girls' quartet was practicing a song. Delsa stayed after school and played the piano for them. Jeff came over and leaned his elbows on the piano and beat time for the girls, watching Delsa over the bright heads of the youngsters. After the practicing was over, Jeff and Delsa walked down the road toward Jeff's house together. Jeff said, with a strange urgency in his voice, "Are you going to let me take you to the wedding, Delsa?" Delsa laughed, surprise giving a ring to her voice. "Oh, Jeff! You know I don't go anywhere with anyone!" Jeff smiled wryly. "I should think you could go with your principal without hurting your conscience at all. Goodness knows, Delsa, I haven't any idea of beating Hugh's time. It's just that everyone will be going and I thought Delsa put her hand impulsively "How has the town been treating on Jeffs arm. You?" Delsa put her hand impulsively on Jeff's arm.
"It's all right, Jeff," she said. She had remembered, then, that she was no longer bound to Hugh. She could go to the dance with anyone she chose. She felt suddenly cold and alone.
JEFF must have been watching her face more closely than she knew for he spoke quickly. "Don't look like that, Delsa. Hugh'll be back one of these days and then we'll all be dancing at your wedding. I'm sorry I made you unhappy."
They went on in silence, each busy with his own thoughts, until they reached Jeff's gate and Davy came running to meet them.
But when Delsa's work at Jeff's had been done and she went out into the clear blue night, she was startled to see a man's form leaning over the gate, obviously waiting for her. She knew at once that it wasn't Jeff; and almost as immediately she knew who it was?Alec Windsor, the forest green of his marine uniform dark against the starlit sky.
"Hello, there!" he said happily, familiarly, as if he had waited for her every night for years.
Delsa smiled up at him. "This is a surprise!" she cried. "It's been a long, long time since there were young men in town with leisure to lean on gates!"
He answered soberly, "It's been a long, long time since I had leisure to lean on a gate, I assure you. But now that I do have the leisure, I am going to make good use of it."
He fell into step beside her and they walked up the wind-tossed path to Marriott home.
"How has the town been treating you?" Delsa asked, for want of something better to say.
"Fine!" he laughed. "Only everyone is so busy with Jim and Lina and plans for the wedding, I've had to shift for myself a bit today. Not that I mind," he hastened to add, "but I had plenty of time to remember you and how pretty you looked last night with that blue ribbon in your hair. Gosh," he went on, "what you girls could teach those South Sea natives?or could you?"
Delsa laughed. It was definitely pleasant to have someone to walk with in the cool spring evening. And when Alec took her arm and drew her a little closer to his side, she felt the old, half-forgotten thrill of being liked and protected.
They walked slowly, talking of many things, and when they reached Delsa, she turned and looked up at the tall, dark, serious boy who reminded her so much of Hugh.
"Come in and have supper with us," she invited.
He hesitated a moment, and then smiled like a little boy caught in mischief.
"Thanks," he said.
"But I can get Dad to step over and tell your friends . . ." she began, but he grinned more broadly.
"I've already told them that I might not be home to supper," he said. "I had hopes."
"Oh, you marines!" Delsa laughed, and opened the door.
Her parents were happy to have a young man at the table again, and the meal went gaily. Afterward, Alec put on one of Mrs. Marriott's aprons and wiped the dishes for Delsa. "WHEN the kitchen was shipshape and Delsa would have gone into the living room where her parents were, Alec stopped her. "Let's sit here in the kitchen/" he suggested. "Gosh, it's been so long since I sat in a real kitchen!" He sniffed audibly. "I like the smell of it!" So they drew up chairs and sat beside the table with its red-checked cloth, and talked, with Alec getting up now and then to put sticks of wood into the big, old-fashioned stove. After a while Delsa said, "It's rather late in the year for popping corn?we generally do that in the winter time. But we still have some good corn left?and it's always fun!" So they popped corn and sprinkled it with salt and with homemade, unrationed butter, and ate it in big handfuls. But at last Alec had to go. He frowned at the big wooden clock ticking away persistently on the kitchen shelf, and said, "You're a school marm, and I know what modern kids are. You'll need all the reinforcement of a good night's sleep to handle them, I bet." Delsa smiled. "These children aren't bad," she said. "They are just the town kids?I've known them all ever since they were born. I've taught them in Sunday School and Primary?and they aren't spoiled like city children. They all have plenty of work to do in their homes ?it makes them more responsible and obedient." He looked at her wonderingly. "You really like them, don't you?" he asked. "I wonder if I ever had a teacher that really liked me?" "Of course you did, silly!" Delsa said with a sudden tightening of her throat. Alec reached across the table and put his big, brown, hard hand over hers. "Who's taking you to the wedding dance, Delsa?" he asked gently. THERE it was, her chance, handed to her on a silver platter. But she couldn't take it?not just yet. Delsa thought of Hugh and of Jeff. She could go with Alec?but that was so sudden. It might fool her mother and Hugh's mother, who wanted her to be attracted by the newcomer; but it wouldn't fool Jeff Holden. He would think she had refused him and then had accepted Alec's invitation to show him that she didn't care for him at all? that she didn't want even to trust him as her escort to Jim's and Lina's wedding. She shook her head gently. "No one," she said. "I go with Mother and Dad." Alec opened his hand, which now held hers, and looked down at her fingers. Hugh's ring, a simple little token?but all that she had wanted ? circled her finger. The tiny diamond winked up at Alec, like a bright tear. "He's pretty wonderful, I'll bet, to have a girl like you waiting for him." Delsa felt that she ought to defend her position, somehow. She began, hesitatingly, "And there's Millie, Alec. Oh, I don't want to point out your social obligations-it's not that?but I know Millie would feel hurt if you took me?" A sudden smile broke across Alec's dark features, and he squeezed her hand gently. "You're absolutely (Continued on page 620) Flowers and Fruit for the Table Adele Matheson AT the table the family gains the fuel for living. Children grow and develop from its bounties. Three times each day, through all seasons, parents, children, relatives, and friends come together to participate in the all-essential requirement for physical survival. What, then, must be the importance of this homely routine? What can be done to lift this commonplace function into a less prosaic experience? The piquancy of well-selected and carefully prepared food is an indispensable requirement. Beyond this, resourcefulness, art, and skill must be constantly employed to give surprise and zest to table arrangements. The mother-hostess must never give way to the mere "feeding of the family" routine. Never should our loved ones be called to surround a "tired table." Color is a pleasant invitation to happy dining. Its use is not expensive, and color demands no drudgery. Use color in flowers and fruit, in dishes and table linen. Create colorful food combinations and watch the effect of lifted spirits and congenial gaiety when the diners see the fresh beauty that beckons them to the table. Suggestions for good table setting ?may come from the particular meal, the season, or the occasion. Photograph courtesy W. Atlee Burpee CREAMY YELLOW COSMOS AGAINST THE CORAL PINK OF A FLUTED SHELL ?Photograph courtesy W. Atlee Burpee PALE YELLOW AND GOLDEN GAILLARDIAS IN CREAM-WHITE BOWL Holidays and birthdays, the wedding anniversary, Sunday dinner, a fireside supper, breakfast on the porch?all provide an opportunity for the alert and loving housekeeper to portray her artistic ability. The table covering, whether it be a cloth or runners, is the background for the setting of china and accessories. The linens may vary according to the meal?breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Faultlessly-ironed linens contribute much to the charm of a table setting. For dinners, and particularly for formal occasions, white linens are always correct. However, the delicately tinted rayons so popular at present provide a rich background which makes the table fairly sparkle. Hand-blocked peasant linens in gay floral patterns and fruit motifs offer a wide choice in the selection of an inexpensive covering to be used for the breakfast table. Set with gaily colored pottery, such a table presents an invitation to enjoyment which stimulates the day's activities. 'INHERE is never a meal where floral decorations are out of place, never a buifet supper nor a children's party that is not made more attractive by artistic flower arrangements. These decorative centerpieces should be simple, composed of clear, bright colors, entirely cheerful in effect. Nasturtiums, intermixed with their crisp green leaves, are appetite-inspiring flowers. The simplest arrangement is suitable for the informal luncheon. A few sprays of asters or cosmos, if placed in an appropriate container, will make a FLOWERS AND FRUIT FOR THE TABLE 611 lovely centerpiece for this meal. Calendulas and marigolds reflect the warmth and brilliance of the autumn season. The ingenuity of the mother-hostess is put to the test in the choice of flowers which may be available in the family garden plot. Charming center decorations may be made by placing one or two dahlias or chrysanthemums in a shallow dish filled with water. Pansies, also, provide an attractive center of interest by cutting the stems and letting the petals float on the water. Petunias, in their gay multicolors, are a delight, and they adapt themselves to almost any type of container. Autumn is particularly lavish in its gifts of color and beauty. Grains of all kinds, in their golden splendor, offer endless opportunities for attractive table decorations. Feathery oats, in gleaming yellow, against a blue bowl make a picture not soon forgotten. Weed stems, red berries, colored leaves, are gifts from autumn ?gifts that we may bring inside our homes. Fruit arrangements are at all times appealing. Luscious grapes are irresistibly tempting, especially in clusters of green and purple which can be draped gracefully over the edge of a bowl. Mixed fruits, such as oranges, bananas, apples, pears, and peaches do not lack in decorative appeal. Fruits of contrasting form should be selected for combinations. There should usually be a preponderance of one kind of fruit, with color and line accents of other kinds. Whatever type of centerpiece is selected, the arrangement should never be high enough to obstruct the view across the table. DINING TABLE WITH FRUIT CENTERPIECE Picture taken at Lion House, Salt Lake City. Dining room decoration by Mary Grant Judd Also, it should not be so flat that it does not display itself to advantage. If the table is long, several small arrangements may be more effective than a single elaborate centerpiece.
Candles for the dinner table provide a festive touch, but they should be used only in the evening when artificial light is required. For intimate occasions the light from the fireplace may be sufficient for the evening meal.
While individual ingenuity must be depended upon for variety and results, there are certain basic rules for table setting. The linen, china, and silver required will depend upon the meal and the menu. However, the placing of the napkins, silver, china, and glassware is the same for all occasions. The napkin is folded simply?large napkins with the monogram up, and smaller napkins with the long side toward the plate.
Silver is placed on the table at the beginning of a meal only for the courses which are served before the tines up, and all knives and spoons to the right of the individual setting. They should be laid at right angles to the edge of the table, about an inch from the edge. The blades of the knives should be turned toward the plate. Each piece of silver should be laid in the order in which it is to be used, from the outside in. If more silver is required it should be placed upon the table immediately before the course for which it will be used. The tumbler or goblet for water should be placed an inch above and slightly to the right of the largest knife. Butter plates should be placed to the left and above the forks, with the butter knife lying across the rim of the butter plate.
Pleasure may be found in doing anything well. The three times daily task of table setting may be made pleasant and adventurous by using materials readily available for bringing beauty to the table. Let us serve our families with thoughtfulness and artistic planning.ORPHANED Dott J. Sartori The maple lets her green-winged fledgings fly Aslant the autumn?s fitful atmosphere. Sightless, they ride among the enemy And conquering soar into the coming year. Now frost and thought of future goading her The gentian floats her parachutist free, Trusting to filaments of gossamer A century's emerald genealogy. The future is flung into the couch of fall? The green world's minute infants swaddled tight In sheaths of brown, impervious but small? To brave alone the winter and the night. THE BOTTOM DRAWER 613 The Bottom Drawer (Continued from page 591) and sat on the floor beside her cedar chest. She took out all her beautiful things and looked at them one by one. What dreams and hopes she had put into them and now they seemed to be the barrier between her and Bart. With a sigh, she replaced them carefully. I'd better get back to bed, she thought. No matter how I feel I must be on hand to teach the children in the morning. One afternoon the next week when Majel got home she found Grandma lying on the couch gasping for breath. The doctor looked grave as he said accusingly, "You?ve been worrying about something." To Majel at the door, he said, "It's this war. Keep her from thinking about it. She can stand about one more attack like that." Majel went back and knelt by the couch. She smoothed back the soft white hair. "You've been worrying about me," she said. "Well, you just get well and I'll be all right." As she got dinner she thought back over the thirteen years she had lived with her grandmother. She must have been a trial at first and a great responsibility. Grandma might have had a very different life without her? trips and friends of her own age. She shouldn't have let Grandma put her through college either. She knew now that she had done right in staying. Bart's letters came now at irregular intervals, sometimes three weeks apart. They were interesting, though, telling of places around New York he visited, of dances at the field. But he never used the extravagant terms of endearment that had so amused her, and he never mentioned the future. Soon after school was out in June, a different kind of letter came. He wrote, "Sometimes when I'm ten thousand feet up I have the strangest impulse to turn west and fly straight back to you. Instead, I'll probably soon be moving east where I can't even be sure of your prim, sweet little letters." This was too much for Majel. She went to her room and cried a long time. When Grandma called her to dinner her eyes were still red but Grandma seemed not to notice. It was not until they were clearing the table that she asked, "You got a letter, didn't you?" Majel said, "Yes." "Is he about through at Long Island?" Another "yes" was all Majel could manage. They were washing the dishes when Grandma spoke again. "You know what I'd do? I'd go and marry him before he goes. I'd fly to get there." Nothing in Majel's life had ever surprised her so much. "Why, Grandma," she faltered. "You?ve always said such marriages weren't decent." GRANDMA interrupted impatiently. "I can change, can't I? I'm in this war, too, and everybody says war changes people." "But he hasn't asked me to come," Majel objected. Grandma seemed not to hear. "You could leave tomorrow and you needn't worry about me. I'm going to visit Cousin Clara. I've already written to her."
Then Majel laughed and hugged her tight. "You're not fooling me a bit," she said, "but I'll do it. You start packing while I get reservations."
When Majel saw Bart all her confidence left her. But his hug and kiss were ardent enough. He guided her over towards the cafe saying, "We'll get something to eat while the baggage is being sorted."
Not until they were through did he demand, "Now tell me, what's the idea?"
"Is it too late?" Majel asked, scarcely above a whisper.
"You surely don't mean you'd marry me now when you wouldn't three months ago. Why, we could have only two or three days together."
Majel spoke rapidly. "You thought it was a home with nice things I wanted. But it wasn't. All those things in my 'bottom drawer' were just?just something to keep me busy while I waited. I could be happy with you in an auto court even. It was my contract. If was my responsibility to Grandma. Oh, Bart, I've been so unhappy because you didn't understand."
"Understand?" At last he said, "Maybe I do now. I've done a lot of thinking." He paused?then laughed. "Why, I suppose, marriage to you is a sort of contract and ?and?a responsibility."
"Yes, oh, yes," she said.
"And I could be sure of having a wife waiting for me when the war is over?"
"Yes."
"Oh, my dear, I guess I like you just the way you are." He took from his pocket a little green velvet box. In it were two rings?one with a large diamond and the other a band. As Majel watched with shining eyes, he took out the engagement ring, reached across the table for her hand and slipped the ring on.
"There," he said, "I've had them three months." Then his voice took on a familiar, teasing tone. "Not that I haven't tried to find someone in New York to give them to."
When Majel heard that tone she knew that everything was right between them. She brushed. "No one would look twice at you. They could all see the sign 'taken' right across your forehead."
Bart got up. "Come on," he said, "I understand it takes time to get married in New York and we haven't a minute to lose." OCHRE LEAVES Ruby Baird Andersen In zeal, my neighbors heaped their leaves in mounds Then watched them go, in curling, smoky spires; And smugly thought: "How neat?my grounds." Not I, to burn such gold in sacrificial pyres. What though the flame of autumn soon expires, Remembered still are buds that April knows, And sound of wind on summer's leafy lyres. Deserving now, these leaves, of some repose, Intimate with earth and kindly fallen snows. Notes FROM THE FIELD Blanche B. Stoddard, General Secretary-Treasurer Regulations governing the submittal of material for "Notes From the Field" appear in the Magazine for February 1944, page 104. Bonneville Stake (Utah) A DELE MATHESON reported a pageant she directed, given at the Relief Society conference in the Garden Park chapel, November 5, 1944. 'The theme was inspired by the current study of biblical literature in the regular Relief Society outline. The material, covering, in effect, the complete life of Christ, was selected by President preserved throughout by the writer: Elizabeth, mother of John the Baptist, appearing first, related the remarkable incidents concerning the birth of her son, and the prophecies forecasting the advent of the Savior. Genet B. Dee from the four gospels. The beauty and simplicity of the biblical expression was GARDEN PARK WARD, BONNEVILLE STAKE, PRESENTS PAGEANT The five women most important in the life of Christ tell their own story in tableau, dialogue, and song at the Relief Society conference in Garden Park Ward, Bonneville Stake, November 5, 1944. These characters, most beloved by the Savior, were played by left to right: Florence Hill as Martha; Lucile Cederlof as Mary; Adele Matheson as Mary, mother of Jesus; Ruth Romney' as Elizabeth; in front. Lota Lamoreaux as Mary Magdalene. The production was written by Genet B. Dee, President of Garden Park Relief Society, and was produced by Adele Matheson. Poge  Mary, the mother of Jesus, unfolded the marvelous story of the miracle of the coming of the Son of God. She told the appealing and human story of the mother and her son from his birth and childhood to his tragic crucifixion. The raising of Lazarus from the dead and the sojourn of the Savior within their humble home, was skillfully depicted in conversation between Martha and Mary. The story of Mary Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils, was recalled in its forceful simplicity and the dramatic summary of the scene at the cross which concluded the story. "Appropriate musical numbers interspersed the program: 'A Voice in the Wilderness? 'Prepare Ye the Way/ and 'He is Risen/ were rendered by Elaine Tomlinson; 'I Think When I Read That Sweet Story of Old/ by Wanda Gibb; 'Were You There When They Crucified My Lord?' rendered by the Garden Park Girls' Chorus; and 'I Know That My Redeemer Liveth sung by Edward O. Piatt. "The authentic costumes, together with appropriate background and music, contributed to an atmosphere of dignified solemnity, and through the spoken word the characters appeared to actually live their parts. The effect upon the hearers was one of profound reverence. Particularly impressive was the final scene at the cross."

Southern States Mission EFFIE MEEKS, president of Relief Societies of the Southern States Mission, reports that the branches in this Mission are continuing with their project of making a variety of lovely shell craft items. The costume jewelry is particularly beautiful, being made from seashells which are very plentiful in the South. A picture of this shell craft, together with a description of the project, appears on page 588 of Thefor October 1944. A good selection of this shell craft is on display at the Mormon Handi craft Shop, 21 West South Temple Street, Salt Lake City, Utah. Sister Meeks also has a supply at the mission headquarters, and articles may be obtained by writing directly to her at 485 North Avenue, N. E., Atlanta, Georgia.

But this won't keep you from dancing with me, will it?" and he frowned at the little ring. "Of course not," Delsa laughed. "I love to dance, do you?" He nodded, and let go of her hand. Rising, he reached for his cap, which he had hung on a hook behind the door when he came in. Delsa followed him, and as he stood, waiting to leave, twirling his cap in his two hands, Delsa thought, how lonely he is! How alone and away from all the folks that love him ?his mother?his sweetheart! That's the way Hugh was, down there in Australia! She laid her hands on his arm, feeling the rough texture of the cloth beneath her palms. "Drop in any time," she said. "If you feel lonely, come here. The Lewises, of course, are wrapped up in their plans for Jim?but we have nothing to distract us. Mother and Dad would love it?" He bent toward her in that slanting, eager posture so like Hugh's and said, "It's been a wonderful evening, Delsa. And I am going to take you at your word?I am going to drop in here often. I only wish I could go to school, too!" A FTER he was gone Delsa went slowly upstairs to her room, but her mother called to her from her AND FOR ETERNITY 621 bedroom, and Delsa turned and went in. "He's a nice boy," her mother said, with a little gesture that reminded Delsa of the past?of the many nights she had come in from a dance or a party to sit on the pieced coverlet and tell her mother and father of the good time she had had. T But Delsa didn't sit down tonight?the old easy confidence was gone? gone with Hugh?though her mother didn't know it yet. Now between them lay a shadow of restraint and, perhaps, deceit. So Delsa stood beside the bed, ignoring that gentle gesture, and said, "He's had a tough time, out there." "I could see that," her father went on, and his gruff voice was gentle. "I don't suppose he told you much about the fighting? It's terrible?I can't help thinking of all our boys?" Delsa patted his heavy, calloused hand where it lay on the coverlet. "You took yours in the last war. Dad," she said softly. "I guess the boys can take theirs now." They talked a little longer, and Delsa stooped and kissed her parents before she went out of the room. Somehow, tonight, she felt sorrier for them than for herself. They both loved Hugh so much. He had taken the place of the son they had never had, and her father had been the only father Hugh had known. "If it were only my problem alone!" she whispered, "I could go away?I could even face it here. But it is theirs, too. Hugh, Hugh, did you forget Dad?did you forget the pony he gave you when you were ten?the days you have helped him stack hay?the way he taught you to box and wrestle so you could hold your own with the bigger boys? Did you forget mother? and her cookies and her presents?her affection that gave you two mothers where less fortunate boys have but one?" She knelt by the window, looking out over the trees to where the snowy crest of the mountain that guarded the valley stood pale and white in the moonlight. Between the mountain and her window lay the acres of her father's farm, and beyond them other acres, and then the road and the foothills where she and Hugh had gone Eastering and May walking and hunting pine nuts and cutting Christmas trees. "I am not a dog in the manger," she told herself at last, "hanging onto Hugh when he is tired of me and wants to be free. I am remembering my parents and Aunt Martha?and I am holding on for them, too." Suddenly she bent her head onto her arms and cried, "And for you, too, Hugh?Oh, now, tonight, I know how you must have felt, out there. And, tonight, I don't blame that girl so much?I know how she must have felt, too." To be continued) Work Meeting Plan Now for Christmas DOLLS AND MENAGERIES OUT OF A SCRAP BAG LAST month on this page suggestions were given for holding a successful apron day in work meeting to help members style and make aprons for Christmas giving. That activity had been planned and carried out by Sister Thelma Kam-merman, work director of Parley's Ward, Highland Stake. The General Board believes that by sponsoring different types of sewing activities in work meetings, all members of Relief Society, the young as well as the older, may become actively interested in sewing and take part in the sewing program of Relief Society. This month Sister Melvina Sheets describes another type of sewing activity for providing Christmas gifts which was carried on very successfully in her ward. "If you were to have visited the Highland Park Ward, Highland Stake, on the second Tuesday of last October, you would have had a glimpse of busy mothers, grandmothers ? yes, even great-grandmothers all enthusiastically working. Some were cutting, some sewing, others pulling bits of white fluffy cotton from large bats and stuffing it firmly into varied shapes for legs, arms, heads, tails, ears and bodies. Stuffed toys were in the making! Page 622 There were dolls with embroidered faces, short and tall Raggedy Anns and Andys, baby dolls, upside-down dolls, and a big doll?a girl thirty-two inches tall, complete with panties, slip, dress, and bonnet, or perhaps with a large bow in her yarn hair. There were brunettes, blondes, and redheads, a complexion to suit anyone's choice. "Cuddly animal toys proved to be popular with the younger mothers, such as: Jumbo, the elephant with his great floppy ears?with a tiny Jumbo, too; the long-necked giraffe and baby with ruffled manes; Scotty, the bow-wow dog; the pony so proud of his long yarn mane and tail; the teddy bear; Peter Rabbit with his pink eyes, ears, and nose; but better still, the white wooly lamb with colored face and tummy which proved to be a favorite with everyone. "It was while helping my niece make a set of rag dolls for her tiny daughter that the idea had come to me that this might be an answer to the Christmas suggestion question. I had immediately gone pattern hunting and had been pleasantly surprised to find so many patterns for different animals and dolls. I also cut additional patterns in order to have plenty on hand so that everyone one would be able to keep busy and happy.
In order to know the amount of material needed and to familiarize myself with each pattern, I made up one article of each pattern. Being very thrilled and satisfied with my menagerie, I placed the toys on display at our next Relief Society meeting. Thus began weeks of work and fun. Each mother, grandmother, sister, or great-grandmother was anxious to make the toy of her choice.
"I asked for pieces of material ranging from one and a half yards to only a quarter of a yard, and these were put in a scrap bag to be used as needed. We used peach-colored washable chintz for the faces, arms, and legs of the dolls. This I purchased, along with the cotton bats for stuffing, the string yarns (black, brown, yellow, and rust) for the hair, and the large, white bath towels for the little lambs. It was found that five lambs could be cut from two towels.
"Our project was most successful. A repeat program of this type has been requested, and we are planning to make an entire beginner's class next year."
