OCTOBER MAGIC Jeanette P. Parry October, the roving gypsy. Is here in my garden again, With scarfs of exotic color To tie on the hillside and glen. The valley wears a grape-blue veil, To hide the sadness in her heart; It is hard to see October go And with her jocund spirit part. Through dreamy, shifting, opal days The river dons a silver coat, And hosts of gold and crimson leaves Upon its placid surface float. The sun climbs down the autumn sky And leaves a flame-like afterglow, Soon winter's biting winds may sweep Across the frozen wastes of snow.
