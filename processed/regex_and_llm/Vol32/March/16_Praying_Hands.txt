PRAYING HANDS Clarence Edwin Flynn On broad, green fields are many hands that labor, Turning to sun and rain the fresh, sweet soil. Wielders of hammer, pen, and loom, and saber. Alike must live upon their daily toil. Under the summer sun they do their duty, Loosing the ground that roots and stalks may grow, Coaxing to richness and productive beauty The waving ear and tassel, row on row. Comes a bright day when autumn's sun is slanting Its mellow rays across the golden grain. They gather then the harvest of their planting. Grateful that they have labored not in vain. All these are praying hands. An old petition Their labor makes?one that has long been said By those of every country and condition: "Give us, we ask, this day, our daily bread." Notes TO THE FIELD Materials for the 1945 Welfare Clothing Budget THE following information regarding materials for the 1945 welfare clothing budget has been received by the General Board from the General Church Welfare Committee: In the fall of 1944 the Clothing Committee submitted a report to the General Welfare Committee which covered the materials that would be needed for the 1945 welfare clothing budget assignment. At that time, information which had previously been supplied by government officials in Washington indicated that it was probable that the materials for this clothing assignment would be made available to the Welfare Program. In the latter part of December the situation changed and it then became apparent that most of the materials, which we proposed to use, were still critically needed in the war effort. It has, therefore, been decided that while present conditions exist, it will not be advisable to file for priorities. The clothing program will proceed as materials become available to which we are properly entitled on a quota basis. The most recent information from the wholesale houses with which the General Committee has heretofore done business is that there is no immediate prospect of securing the clothing materials in the quantities that are required to fill the 1945 budget assignment. It is the plan of the General Committee to keep in close touch with the market and take advantage of the full quota of materials as they become available. This means that it will not be possible for the General Committee to supply the materials needed so that the budget can be completed during the first six months of this year as many of the Relief Society sisters desire. It is hoped, however, that materials will be available so that the budget can be completed by the end of 1945. As materials are received, they will be allocated in a fair manner to those to whom the budgets have been assigned. The question has arisen as to whethei stake or ward welfare committees shall be encouraged to purchase materials from lo cal sources to complete their clothing assignments. If materials can be purchased at wholesale prices without working a hardship on the community, it will be proper for the stake and ward welfare committees to purchase such materials and advise the General Committee so that the General Committee will not overpurchase later on. However, if it is necessary to go into the retail markets and pay retail prices and take from the shelves of local merchants materials that are needed to meet the general needs of the local community, such purchases should not be made. Where quilting is done, the General Committee can supply the batts needed from stocks now on hand. During the time that materials for welfare sewing are not available, the General Board recommends that Relief Society women devote themselves to other sewing activities on the
