Easter and the Second Coming of the Lord Elder Leo J. Muir Former President Los Angeles Stake And Former President Northern States Mission (Chicago) AS thoughtful and devout Christians celebrate the coming Easter season, their minds and hearts are likely to be beckoned forward to the coming of the Master, rather than backward to his resurrection. Christ's triumphant arising from the tomb is being overshadowed by the nearness of his second coming to the earth. The early future promises to realize for mankind the prophetic salutation: "Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven."
Here indeed is heaven's supreme salutatory to mortal man. This proclamation has provoked more discussion and speculation than any other word or prophecy. The unbeliever has jested about it and ridiculed it. Many people have predicted the immediate fulfillment all down the generations of time. The devout have fearfully and reverently invoked God's day for its fulfillment.
The signs of the times point to the early coming of this glorious spectacle the coming to earth of the Lord Jesus Christ in the clouds of heaven. That we might contemplate this auspicious occasion in its full significance let us review briefly the scenes in the great drama which closed with this marvelous prophecy. The events of the Passion Week are punctuated by a few sentences which stand out in bold relief against the dismal background of shame and sorrow.
Out of the peaceful, yet disturbing, ceremony of the Last Supper came the immortal injunction: "This do ye in remembrance of me." From the shadowed precincts and the deep anguish of Gethsemane came the grief-laden prayer of the Master: "O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt."
"And they crucified him" is the laconic account of the cruel and gruesome tragedy of Golgotha. These colorless words a conjunction, two pronouns, and a verb record the fact of the execution of the Son of God, who died that death may be no more. On death's own battlefield, Christ the Lord destroys death for the children of men.
"Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews" was the accusation written in three languages: the Hebrew, the Greek, and the Latin. The first of these is the tongue through which God had revealed his will to his prophets; the second is the language of culture and the learning of that day; and the third, the language
Page 139 of the conquering race which then held the Holy Land under subjection. This superscription, thus written, heralded to all people the alleged reason for the conviction and crucifixion of the Christ. The "Chief Priest of the Jews" protested that the accusation was not right: that it should indicate that Christ had said he was King of the Jews. Pilate stubbornly refused to alter the superscription and there it stood. It must have pleased the heart of Jesus to know that his true status as King of the Jews was so boldly proclaimed.
"Truly this was the Son of God" was the emphatic verdict of the Roman centurion who had, as an officer on guard, observed the stupid and brutal performance.
"He is risen" came as the calm and solemn assurance of the angel who answered the excited inquiry of "Mary Magdalene and the other Mary." Though calmly spoken, and to these two women alone, these angelic words reflect the triumphant climax in this eternal drama. And what triumph it was indeed; not alone for the resurrected Christ, who knew full well that he would arise, but for these faithful women and for all the disciples to whom they carried the glorious message. They restored that if Christ arose from the tomb, man also will arise from his tomb. In this fact mortal life finds its loftiest hope. No greater boon could be fashioned for the souls of men. The two women doubted not the report of the angel, but, at his bidding, hastened "with fear and great joy" to carry the glad tidings to those whom Christ affectionately called "my brethren." On the way they met the Christ,
and were requested to summon his disciples to meet him in a mountain in Galilee. Here in the uplands, against the sky, the Christ whose ministry was now given new force and power gave final instruction to those who should follow him.
"All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world." In these humble, yet powerful words, the Master transmitted to his "brethren" the spiritual momentum of the resurrection. As all power was given unto him in heaven and in earth, so a measure of that power would be theirs. Possessed of that power, they were to go forth teaching all nations and bringing them into the fold of Christ. No greater task was ever given to man! But these were empowered men. Their leader had risen from the tomb. The glory and the power of the resurrected Lord motivated their deeds. The Lord's assurance "Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world" became at once their authority and their commission. The labor and sacrifices of these men in the dark years that followed, bear indubitable evidence that they were motivated by this authority and commission. Thus the divine drama ends. The story of the mortal sojourn of the Christ is told.
NOW comes a new disclosure of eternal import. The risen Lord ascends into the heavens, as was expected. But, "while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; Which also said. EASTER AND THE SECOND COMING OF THE LORD 141 Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven." Thus, as one drama is ended, a new one is proclaimed. As the people in his day looked forward to his resurrection, the generations following thereafter have looked forward to his second coming. Such is our situation today. This generation of men may well witness the fulfillment of this earth-shaking prophesy. But we must be ready for it, for Christ is to come to a people prepared for him. Where is that people? Will the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints be prepared to play that role? Let us ponder for a moment those words of the Roman centurion: 'Truly this was the Son of God." Centuries before the birth of Christ, Isaiah had foretold that men should call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, "God with us." Joseph called his name Jesus. Herod, seeking to destroy the infant Christ, asked, "Where is he that is born King of the Jews?" Heaven had proclaimed him Wonderful, Counseller, The mighty God, the everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace, Jehovah, Messiah, Son of David, the Word, the Lamb of God, the Lion of the house of Judah, the Redeemer, the Brightness of the Father's glory, the God of Jacob, the Glory of his people Israel. The Master bore testimony of his own mission in this fashion: "I AM," "I am the bread of life," "I am the way of truth and the life," "I am the resurrection and the life." The Christ has been introduced by the Father in these endearing words, 'This is my beloved Son." The scriptures proclaim that the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy, and it is affirmed that the government shall be upon his shoulders and of his kingdom there shall be no end. All this was unknown to the Roman centurion, yet without this knowledge, this officer of the law deduced the profound truth, the most significant fact in the story of mortal life: "Truly this was the Son of God." Upon that question all men must take their stand. "There is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved." "Every knee must bow and every tongue confess that Jesus is the Christ." One does not need the discernment of the Roman centurion to comprehend that the power of the Lord Jesus Christ is today dominating the course of world events. He has promised that he will pour out his spirit upon all flesh. Addressing himself to the house of Israel, he has said: "Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you:... I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.... I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you.... Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations." Following these assurances of the cleansing of Israel and of her repentance comes this notable pronouncement: "Thus saith the Lord God; I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them."
It would seem proper to assume that this action on the part of the house of Israel must precede the second coming of the Lord. When the house of Israel however, it may be constituted or represented makes this request of the Lord God "to do it for them," we may be assured that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints intrusted as it is and has been with the commission to gather Israel, and with the keys and authorities of the dispensation of Abraham will assume vast and definite responsibilities in this momentous work. The God of Israel. The mountain of the Lord's house has been established in the tops of the mountains, and has been exalted above the hills; and all nations have flowed unto it. So also has John gone forth in the spirit of Elias, and has turned the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; and has thus "made ready a people prepared for the Lord."
