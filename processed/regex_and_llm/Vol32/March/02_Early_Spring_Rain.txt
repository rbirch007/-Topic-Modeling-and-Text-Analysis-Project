EARLY SPRING RAIN
Ora Lee Parthesius
The sky is soft as a dove's gray wing, And through the silvered pattering Steals fragrance. Is it mignonette Or lilacs worn by some coquette? . . . Yes, winter's flirting with the spring! No Tongue Can Tell Marguerite J. Griffin "OUT there we talk of death quite calmly," said a young sailor, home on leave after seeing action in the South Pacific. "We talk over what has happened to this one and that one of our friends. We never spare the details. We talk of death quite as matter-of-factly, as if we were discussing a newspaper item. We might as well. It's all around us out there, and we know it. I've seen more things than I can tell you."
He was much changed, this young man, from what he had been when he had gone away. Two years older? Yes, but more than that. His ordinarily fair-skinned face was bronzed from the rigors of sea life. But there were shadows across his brow, faint ones easily removed by his ready smile, but still lurking there in moments of repose. There was a firm new purpose to his jaw, as though, whatever his naval rank, he was master of himself no matter what the days might bring. And all this change because he had seen more things than tongue can tell. Physical suffering he had seen because he served with the medical corps. Death he had seen. Men dying before his very eyes. Men dying without a whimper, without a complaint.
"After one bombing we went about on deck helping the wounded. They were lying all about. I saw a fellow who had been my best friend lying over his gun. I thought he was dead, but when I came up to him he recognized me and he said: 'Do not move me for the others are
about done for.' But I had to do something for him. He was my friend. He died an instant later in my arms, and then I was glad, seeing his condition. This is something I will never forget as long as I live. Yes. Death is something we talk about quite openly. It's there and you have to face it."
That was the thing that made this boy different from what he had been before. He had been face to face with death. He knew he would go back to face it again, but in the meantime he would serve as best he could and smile all the while. While life lasted there were things to do for the living and last respects to the dead. Time enough to worry about danger when it struck. Two years ago he had been a young, care-free boy. Today he is a man, brave, master of himself and his emotions. And what has wrought the change? One thing. His ability to face reality, look it squarely in the eye, and spend his strength getting the most possible joy out of the real things of life, people, places, and comradeship.
What are you doing, mothers of these boys who have become men overnight, who have seen more things than tongue can tell? What are you doing to change your own souls that would like to cringe and shrink into citadels strong and sure? What am I doing to prepare myself against the day when my sons must go forth to face the pains of life and death upon their own? How do we mean to face the problems of our own
lives courageously? We believe we could endure the dangers our sons face more easily than to know that they, in whose veins flow our own blood, must suffer, endure, and perchance die. But if our task is great, we must be greater.
I have seen mothers become whimpering old women, old long before their time, after their sons had sailed away to front-line action. I have seen them become helpless neurotics who can't stand to hear a news broadcast, who can't bear to read a paper. If it were helping these boys, then it would have purpose. But worry, anxiety cannot reach out and stop the bombs from falling. Instead, they twine like tentacles about the one who conceived them, crushing from her all the breath of life, like an octopus with its overpowering grip.
Again I have seen mothers, with heads erect, lock their secret heartaches into a dark corner of their beings, and valiantly go forth to take their parts in the many duties of life at home. Why the difference? Why does one cringe and one remain indomitable. The reason is simple, depending upon whether you fight with life or against it, whether you look the whole thing squarely in the face like the young seaman. It is whether you, too, know that death is there and will admit it, or whether you are trying to avoid it, to fight your own small futile fight, you know. Since Adam, men who have lived upon this earth have died. In that one thing all humanity are brothers. You know that each man must die, but don't push the knowledge back into a far corner of your heart and refuse to face it. Well, bring it out into the
light and let the sun shine upon it for awhile. You are going to die. Your son is going to die. No matter how you live, or grieve, or worry, you cannot change this fact. War doesn't make much difference then. It only makes you more aware that death stalks the earth.
BUT you say: "My boy is so young! What a pity a life is cut short in youth!" So we always feel. A pity to die so young! But what does it matter if life be long or short? The important thing is, how have we lived and how have we died. The day to an honest man, busy with his constructive work, may seem all too short. The same day to a criminal waiting to pay for his crime upon the gallows may seem a fortunate eternity. But the day had twenty-four hours, and if it rained it rained for both. The difference is only in the human heart, in the way of life. One man knows the peace of honesty, the other the remorse, the despondency of a life which must pay for wasted deeds. Who, then, can measure a life, if it be long or short? Better to say it was rich or poor. Rich in valiance, in love, in honor, or poor in fear, in selfishness, in smallness of spirit. True it is, today many a youth gives his life, brief in years, but full of valor. "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends."
"Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you." A strange thing? It has happened over and over in this world, but there has appeared with it the strange. It is something we have never felt before. It is a thrust to our courage. But we are not alone. Dogs that help? Every soul who has lived has had to face his Gethsemane, even the Son of Man. "Forasmuch as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin."
As human beings we must suffer some things over which we have no control, sickness, financial reverses, death, but at least if we seek an honorable way to life we can spare ourselves many heartaches of our own making.
There are so many things to benefit humanity that need to be done. Your sons are doing a big part of them. There is much remaining for us to do at home. There will always be a need for worthwhile tasks, well done.
"And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell." And what person is it we should fear? None other than our own selves. True we must answer the call of death, for that is an event of life through which all must pass, but how we die and how we live
that is our own affair. We can chart a course which will steer us safely through troubled waters or we can let our souls crack up in the storm. It is for us to choose.
"And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me." Hear the words of the Son of God who gave his life upon the cross to break the bonds of death, that the sea might one day give up the dead that are in it, that he might say unto the dry, parched, shattered bones of war, "Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live: and I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the Lord." The same Lord who said: "These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world."
As he leads let us follow, and while our days endure in the world we, too, can overcome the trials that beset our days, we can take up our cross and follow him. We can feel his peace which is so sweet no tongue can tell. THE SNOWBALLS Olive Rose Helton A bit of gleaming white, A breath of sweet perfume, A tiny snow-white bud, And then a large full bloom. Now sparkling in the sunlight, Now shadowed by the trees; No lovelier flower in springtime, Than snowballs in the breeze. Work Meeting UTILITY APRONS IN most present-day households the homemaker finds it necessary not only to do her own housework, but to learn how to conserve her energy so she can accomplish all the tasks she desires to do. These aprons are practical in any kind of household but they are invaluable in homes where there are busy mothers and small children. The large pockets become convenient "catch-alls" for numerous articles which become misplaced. If the pockets are lined with oiled silk or a plasticized material they can also be used to carry a damp cloth for wiping off stray fingermarks, a cloth for furniture polishing, a whisk broom, etc. Such utility articles might be made on a Relief Society Work Meeting in the spring or for a coming bazaar. The apron (Illus. I) is very easily made using 3/5 yd. Of material 27" wide for the apron proper, and 8" of contrasting material for the pockets. The apron is most effective using a light color for the background and a very dark color for the pockets. The apron (Illus. 2) can be made in medium size using 21/8 yds. Of 35" material. If a head bandana is made of the same material, a very smart effect is achieved in this utility costume. The apron ties and is also buttoned down the back. The large pockets end a little beyond the side seams. This apron is unusually effective if a bright gay, solid color is used. Bias tape in a contrasting color makes an easy finish to use for binding.

MESSAGES FROM THE MISSIONS (Continued from February Magazine) East Central States Mission THE following reports from four of the branches of this mission were received during 1944. Their Mission Relief Society President, Leone W. Doxey, submitted all but one. "In the country district of Gretna, Virginia," wrote Sister Doxey, "we have a Relief Society with sixteen members, thirteen of whom are not members of the Church. "The meetings of tlie Gretna Relief Society are held Tuesday afternoons in the home of Sister Maria Rowland, 'Granny,' as she is lovingly called by all who know her. The home is a fine old Virginia farmhouse that had been the home of her husband's father and mother. Granny moved into it as a bride. She is now nearly eighty years old and has been a member of the Church for more than forty years. She teaches the theology lessons in Relief Society and is an inspiration to everyone there." Mrs. L. H. Snow, president of the Chadottesville (Virginia) Relief Society, wrote July 20, 1944: "In and around this city and also other big towns, we see many beautiful little country churches closed for lack of preachers. Women from Page 184 some of these churches are joining the Relief Society and are glad to get something to do. I wish you could see our women working, making rugs, quilts, et cetera. The people in the country want to piece quilts so Iam taking them the material. I am also taking them samples of a miniature redchecked apron and a tiny pair of blue and white striped overalls, to help in the collection of contributions to the building fund. A note in the apron pocket has space for filling in the woman's name and her waist measurement, and carries the suggestion, "A penny for every inch." A similar note in the overall pocket suggests that the men pledge either work on the chapel or a cash donation. We also have one member in Hampton, and she is making something for the bazaar in October. Some members up in the Blue Ridge near Standardsville are making quilts?one woman gave the top, filling, and bottom for a quilt last night. This project is getting every one doing something, and in that way they learn what we stand for and what we are doing in trying to teach the gospel. The people are hungry for the gospel and for friends." Sister Doxey reports an unusual Relief Society meeting held at Fairmont, Virginia, which came to her attention through Sister Crozier Kimball, a short-term missionary. NOTES FROM THE FIELD 185 RELIEF SOCIETY OF HARKERS ISLAND (NORTH CAROLINA), EAST CENTRAL STATES MISSION Picture submitted March 1944 by M. LA. President Raymond Guthrie who stated: This Society was organized in 1923 under adverse circumstances and almost unbearable persecution. Although at that time the membership was very small it has since grown, through the faith and charity exercised by the sisters, to the present membership of 30. Left to right, front row: Virgie Lewis, Annie B. Guthrie, Annie Rose, Annie Lee Lawrence, Edith Willis (Secretary), Gertie Willis (1st Counselor), Letha Lewis (President), Blanch Willis (2d Counselor), Lillian Davis (teacher), Belva Gillikin, Mamie Hamilton, Clara Willis and Edith A. Willis; second row: Nettie Brooks, Naomi Guthrie, Flora Belle Willis, Hannah Guthrie; third row: Glennie Guthrie, Mattie Whitley, Bessie Hancock, Nannie Willis and Hattie Rose. "Sister May Sloter, Relief Society president in Fairmont, had announced on Sunday that the work meeting would be held the following Wednesday afternoon. The time arrived for the appointed meeting and no one came but the president. She felt discouraged and somewhat upset, but she had said there would be Relief Society meeting so she conducted one. She announced the song and sang it, opened the meeting with prayer, sang again and then sat down and quilted for an hour. At the end of the hour she sang another song and dismissed the meeting with prayer. She put her work away and returned to her home with joy and satisfaction in her heart. Sister Sloter is loved and respected by the members of the Fairmont Branch and though the membership is small, after this example of faithfulness, all who possibly can now attend the meetings." Northern California Mission MARY SMITH ELLSWORTH, recently released president of Relief Societies of the Northern California Mission, wrote last June: "During the year thus far I have visited in every district with President Ellsworth. The most outstanding thing I find is the increased spirit of unity and cooperation and love among all our sisters. Our Relief Society meetings are held in most branches immediately following Sunday School; while the men Attend Priesthood meeting, the Relief Society and Primary convene. RELIEF SOCIETY MEMBERS.

Inset shows presidency with birthday cake, with President Lorena Humphries in center, and Counselors Mary K. Hirst and Mabel Kloss, left and right, respectively. Transportation facilities are more available on Sunday, especially in our outlying districts and where many of our people are engaged in war work. "It is the earnest desire of President Ellsworth to establish a suitable place of meeting for every branch in this mission, and in this the sisters are doing their full part. This year two chapels have been dedicated and property has been purchased in eight branches. The sisters have given dinners not only for their own members, but, in several instances, have served for various clubs and groups who have paid them well. They have held rummage sales to dispose of clothes collected from neighbors and friends as well as our own members. Prior to the sales, these articles are washed or cleaned and mended; they bring in a very good price and help those who need them. High-type character balls and parties which included wholesome and amusing games have placed the sisters in touch with many, thus affording opportunity to teach the gospel by example as well as precept. "We have in the mission, now, 260 local missionaries, many of them our Relief Society sisters. We feel thankful for this, for our younger mothers are gaining experience and knowledge that will qualify them to teach their children the gospel. We appreciate the excellent lessons given us by the General Board. They breathe the pure spirit of the gospel, impel us to action, and help to qualify us for real missionary work." Anna Duckett, secretary-treasurer of the Toyon (Redding, California) Branch Relief Society submitted last July the accompanying pictures and the following article by Eva S. Richards, a member: They Are Still Pioneers NOTES FROM THE FIELD 187 RELIEF SOCIETY SINGING MOTHERS OF SAVANNAH BRANCH (GEORGIA), SOUTHERN STATES MISSION Mission Relief Society President Effie Meeks says this is a splendid singing group which is a factor in maintaining interest in Relief Society work there. "In the shadow of snow-capped Mt. Shasta lies a minute branch of the Church?the Toyon Branch. It is situated on the hills and bluffs overlooking the Sacramento River and Shasta Dam, the world's second largest concrete structure. "The construction of this dam has brought people from all over the world, both as workers and visitors, and so the Toyon Branch is very cosmopolitan with representation from Canada, Australia, Germany, England, Sweden, Holland, as well as most of the states, from coast to coast. "The dam is fifteen miles from the nearest California town of any size, and its construction brought five or six thousand persons, some of them Mormons, into a wilderness of red clay, turpentine pines, manzanita, and poison oak. "Some of those who came early in the construction period spent that first miserable winter (three months of constant rain) in canvas tents; but spring comes early in this part of California and by April 1938, homes were started. Poison oak brush was plentiful and had to be cleared; even smoke from its burning carried contamination. Most of the work of clearing was done by women and children, for the work shifts on the dam changed every two weeks for some, while others worked a constant shift of day, swing or graveyard. "The homes usually had their beginning as one-room affairs, but as the men earned steadily, the homes grew. Wells were dug in very unpromising terrain, with accidents, and even casualties, a common occurrence. MEMBERS OF THE NEWLY ORGANIZED RELIEF SOCIETY AT PLYMOUTH. MASSACHUSETTS standing in front of the National Monument to the Forefathers which overlooks the bay. Left to right: Kate Burgesis, Marjorie Pickett, Elder Harold Dance, Estella Hutchins, and Elizabeth Pickett, Relief Society president. The other members unable to be present when picture was taken are Cora E. Bartlett and Cora Ann Glass. Delightful homes with electricity and modern conveniences are seen in the once-wilderness. And now, six years later, "The women worked long and hard to build these homes even though they knew they were to live there but a few years. Some of the women were sickly, some were old, some were having children, but they all had the desire for a home of their own. One family took the red clay, formed it into bricks, and, in one year, built for themselves a spacious six-room home that is now one of the social centers of the branch. "Gardens were made in the red clay by the women and children who carried fertilizer and sand from the river banks. Much to everyone's amazement, the gardens produced. The daughters of the pioneers are still helping to make a garden spot in the West, and are seeing that their children are raised in the culture of home and Church. "The Toyon Branch covers ten square miles. All of the visiting teachers are women who have families of small children, but their work has been done efficiently and on time. The loid anniversary of the organization of the Relief Society was observed March 17 by the Toyon Branch? Crystal candles, wild ferns, redbud and forsythia decorated the community house and an unforgettable program was presented. The war and the closing scenes at Shasta Dam are now sending this group on again to new fields, to new homes. They will carry their spirit of love and endeavor into new communities that have never heard of Mormons or witnessed their industry. "Good luck to you all and Godspeed?modern pioneer women." New England Mission ELDER FOLEY C. RICHARDS was auxiliary supervisor for the mission at the time he submitted the following account, last August: "Again the Relief Society plays the pioneer role in New England, this time in the 'Pilgrim Town,' Plymouth, Massachusetts, where America's forefathers settled three hundred and twenty-four years ago. "On May 23, 1944, a Relief Society was organized there?the first organization of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to be established in Plymouth. Under the direction of President William H. Reeder, Jr., Bertha S. Reeder, mission Relief Society president, and Elder Ted L. Miller, district president, this Society was organized with six members. NOTES FROM THE FIELD 189 FOUR RELIEF SOCIETIES OF THE WESTERN STATES MISSION (Pictures submitted by Luceal R. Curtis, recently released president of the Relief Societies of this mission.) Top row, left to right: Relief Society at Salida, Colorado; Relief Society at Fruita, Colorado, observes the 102d anniversary. Bottom row, left to right: Belle Fourche (South Dakota) Branch also celebrates 102d anniversary of Relief Society; Relief Society at Grand Junction, Colorado. Three of these were Latter-day Saints at the time; one has subsequently been baptized, and the other two are earnest investigators of the gospel. All are the fruits of recent missionary labor. 'These good sisters are enthusiastically meeting together each week, and the future of their group is promising indeed. Each has had to face the usual criticism which attends one who is willing to subscribe to 'Mormon' beliefs, and the Church can be justly proud of them for their Pilgrim spirit of loyalty to their convictions and for their service which makes possible this Latter-day Saint organization in New England's oldest town." Lola Humphreys, writing in the fall of 1944 as auxiliary supervisor, reported the successful Relief Society convention held September 2', at Cambridge, Massachusetts (the mission headquarters) for Relief Society officers. She continues: 'The careful planning which took place several weeks in advance, contributed greatly to the success of the conference which was very well attended by approximately 75 Relief Society officers. "During the forenoon session, a detailed and instructive outline of the duties of the officers was given by Mission Relief Society President Bertha S. Reeder. The remaining time was spent in the bearing of testimonies. At noon, a delicious buffet luncheon was served in one of the rooms of the Cambridge chapel from a table very attractively arranged with candles and flowers. In the afternoon, several talks were given in the homes of different Relief Society branches, and the Singing Mothers of Hartford, Connecticut, offered three beautiful numbers, at intervals.
"The enthusiasm and zeal with which Sister Reeder discussed the problems and with which she delivered her remarks were transferred to every one present. In spite of the fact that some of the members had had travel much more capable of carrying home the day before, they all felt much more capable of carrying on their duties after the convention."
A comprehensive mimeographed bulletin was distributed, carrying a concise and explicit digest of duties of officers and of new instructions, and also a narrative history of the several local Relief Societies in the mission for 1943-44, indicating the problems, activities, and accomplishments of each.
Hawaiian Mission
OLIVIA S. Waddoups, former Relief Society president of this mission, wrote in March 1944: "Brother Waddoups is superintendent of the Leper-asylum here at Kalaupapa. We find a wide field for service to these people who, though entirely confined for life within this area of about 12 square miles, are very happy, cheerful, and contented. They are also very war conscious, buying bonds and stamps to the extent of three times their quota. They are well taken care of by the Territory. We have a very modern hospital, two capable doctors whose wives are nurses in the hospital, five other nurses; 12 Catholic Sisters who manage the hospital, five other nuns; two Catholic priests; one Congregational minister, his wife and three members of his family; the plantation manager and planter; and the general manager for the United States Public Health Service; the Bishop of the Roman Catholic Church; four Brothers who are in charge of the Leper Home for Men; the Catholic, with Reverend Alice, a real Hawaiian lady, to look after her congregation; and our L.D.S. Church. The Elders visit us monthly, and we have a patient here who is the Presiding Elder. We have the smallest congregation but our members are very active and interested.
"The Relief Society sisters who are well enough to get out are very active. Last Sunday we held an anniversary meeting commemorating March 17. We all came dressed in white; there were 9 of us, and 12 young girls and 16 of the Priesthood. I am sure this was the most unique anniversary meeting in the Church. All but two of us are victims of the disease?myself and Sister Kalahau, a very little one, but we try to keep who is blind but who leads the group in their singing. In the group that furnished the singing there were four blind, two on crutches, and others who needed help to get around. But they sang beautifully, and bore testimony that the Lord was good, and kind, and that they were very grateful for the Relief Society organization.
"All in all, we have a little world, a very little one, but we try to keep happy, busy and helpful. We take every precaution possible. We have several people here who have been here over 40 and one 53 years, working with the patients in every way, in the hospital, dressing their wounds, bathing them, and giving (Continued on page 192) The Shape of Peace Eva Willes Wangsgaard I God of all men and nations, Light in Light, I, who am spent with fear and sorrowing, Ask for a ray to follow through this night Darkened by earthen gods to which men cling. There have been other years when I have seen Your star go down like ice from winter's bough, But never has my heart been caught between, And never was it torn as it is now. So soon we shall be called upon to stem The tides of war and plan for peace to be!

II The concept of a structure strong enough To hold all men in concord that will last. To bind great powers, long inured to bluff. Into a kindred whole, is a plan so vast As to exceed the limits of the brain. This is a vision only dreamers see, A pact no sage has ever hoped to gain In any form of practicality. We have no precedent on which to build. It well may be that such a scheme may fail-So great the distance from the grandeur willed To grandeur sculptured to a working scale! Yet build we must?another holocaust As mad as this, and man himself is lost. Page 191 III We know you taught us that the structure stands Imbedded in the individual heart, That other temples are but built on sands, The prey of time and wind they fall apart; But words wear thin; their meanings sleep unknown.

We lack your love immeasurable within; We need your faith in one eternal will For all mankind, before we can begin To plan that tempests lie forever still. Bless those who plan for us.
