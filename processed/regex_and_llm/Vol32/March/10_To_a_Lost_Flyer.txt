TO A LOST FLYER Bessie Jaivis Payne In memory of Captain Lee Jarvis Hailing Killed in action May 5, 1944 Dedicated to his mother Rose Jarvis Hailing Wings approaching in the sky, Slowing as they pass me by. Dipping now in brief goodbye  O'er this home. Wings against the azure deep, Eager flight into the street. Straining eyes that must not weep  Till peace is won. Wings upon the sun-splashed hills Casting shadows o'er the rills. Soaring high, as my heart thrills  Then you're gone. Wings above the ocean's foam Winging far from friends and home. Must you never cease to roam  Dearest one? Broken wings in downward sweep, Swiftly be the fate you meet. Rest now in eternal sleep  Oh, my son.
