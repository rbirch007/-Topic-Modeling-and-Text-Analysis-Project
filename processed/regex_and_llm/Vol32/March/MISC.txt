THE RELIEF SOCIETY MAGAZINE VOL. 32, NO. 3 MARCH 1945 Notice January 16, 1945 REPORTS reaching us indicate that there may be considerable numbers of our boys who are being returned from the various battle fronts in the world to the United States for treatment in hospitals. While our local Church officers in stakes and missions are taking such steps as are available to them to learn who these boys are in order that they may visit them and give such spiritual and other aid and comfort as may be possible, nevertheless, because not all of our boys have the  L. D. S." tag designation, and are generally listed merely as "Protestants" and not as members of our Church, it is not possible for our Church officers to be sure they locate and identify all of our wounded brethren. If the parents or wives of wounded men and women, if any, will send to the office of the First Presidency the names and addresses of their sons, husbands, or daughters who have been wounded and who are in this country for hospital treatment, we will see that their names reach the proper officer stake, ward, or mission so that such officer may be able to get in touch with the wounded and render such service as may be possible. Heber J. Grant J. Reuben Clark, Jr. David O. McKay The First Presidency The Cover: The cover is from a photograph by Willard Luce, "Spring Silhouette RELIEF SOCIETY WELFARE ACTIVITIES Top: Wells Stake-Welfare Sewing Display * Middle: Liberty Stake Canning "Bottom: Salt Lake Stake, 17th Ward-Quilting
