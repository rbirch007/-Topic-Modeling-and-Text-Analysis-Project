sixty years ago, with 18 members (my sister, Eliza R. Snow being the secretary) by the Prophet Joseph Smith, under the inspiration of the Lord; and from that day to the present it has gone on without interruption growing in strength and usefulness, until today it is recognized as one of the most powerful forces for good in the Church. You are now 30,000 strong I am told, with a building fund of nearly $5,000, and with upwards of $100,000 worth of property in your possession. In addition to this you are the only ones among the Saints who are doing anything in a financial way against a day of famine. Your work in this direction is most commendable, and I hear as a result that you have 103,783 bushels of grain, together with an amount of flour and beans, safely stored against a time of need, as well as $3,331 to expend for the same purpose. In a letter of July 1901 signed by the First Presidency, Lorenzo Snow and Joseph F. Smith, it stated: We commend the undertaking [of a woman's building] and have contributed a valuable building site opposite the Temple, valued at $18,000. Sister Zina D. H. Young, President of the Relief Society, died in August 1901, and, in October 1901, President Lorenzo Snow passed away. The new president of the Church, President Joseph F. Smith, called Bathsheba W. Smith to be the new Relief Society president, and the plans continued to progress under her administration. The site which has been described on which a three-story building of yellow pressed brick with a stone foundation was to be built for a woman's building became the Bishop's Building?Relief Society donated $8500 toward its erection and was given quarters in it. The first Relief Society General Board meeting was held in it December 3,1909. This, in brief, is the story of the dream for a Relief Society building which was never built. It is a story of heartache for the Relief Society women who had planned and worked for it for so many years. Relief Society today, however, has already outgrown the space that would have been given it in the proposed woman's building. What seemed a tragedy may prove a blessing and joy to Relief Society in the future. I am thankful for the Relief Society women of the past. I am thankful for their vision. They were great and noble women, women who had faith in their own cause, who loved Relief Society, but who knew that the welfare of the whole Church was above all their welfare. They humbly accepted the decisions of the Church authorities with faith as being in their best interests. They were obedient. May we in our day be as devoted and as faithful? and in all things may we render as full and as unstinted an obedience to the authorities of the Church as did our sisters of long ago is my prayer.
