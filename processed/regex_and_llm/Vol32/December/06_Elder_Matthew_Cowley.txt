Elder Matthew Cowley and Elva Taylor Cowley, daughter, Jewell Cowley Sheffield, and adopted son, Duncan Meha (Toni) Cowley. Elder Matthew Cowley Elder Thomas E. Towler President of Wells Stake SIX months before Elder Mathew Cowley left New Zealand, one of the native saints predicted that he would be chosen an apostle. His patriarchal blessing states: ?You shall come an ambassador of Christ to the uttermost bounds of the earth. Page 722 MATTHEW COWLEY 723Your understanding shall be great and your wisdom reach to heaven." Elder Cowley is eminently trained and qualified for such an exalted position. He was born of goodly parents and lived the gospel in his youth. In his early manhood he married a beautiful and talented young lady, Elva Taylor, and they have labored together to make the world a better place in which to live. Thirteen years of Elder Cowley's life have been devoted to missionary work in New Zealand. He labored there during both of the world wars. His experiences have taught him one of the great lessons of life, namely, 'There are two sides to every story." As a result, he is blessed with a sympathetic understanding, is kind and patient, honest and fair, does not excuse failings in men, but is ever anxious to assist them to overcome their failings. His nature is one of absolute loyalty and he does not like destructive criticism. Because of his genuine humility, he has never sought after any position in the Church. He is altruistic, liberal, and generous. Before leaving New Zealand, he literally gave the coat off his back. A faithful saint admired the topcoat he was wearing, and in a Christ-like spirit, he took it off and gave it to him. Blessed with a sense of wit and humor, coupled with a pleasing personality, has won for him a host of friends. Because of his great work among the Maori people and the thorough understanding he has of them. Elder Cowley is admired and respected by government officials of New Zealand, and has been given important assignments by them. Possibly his greatest achievement is his spiritual and intellectual strength by which he has become a powerful preacher of righteousness. As he travels throughout the Church, he will warm the hearts of the saints and stimulate them to righteous living. The leaders and saints of Wells Stake are appreciative of the life and labors of Elder Cowley at home and abroad. They are firmly convinced that his call came by inspiration and that he will be a tower of strength in the great work of the Lord which lies ahead for him.
