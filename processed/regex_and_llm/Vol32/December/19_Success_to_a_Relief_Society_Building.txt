Success to a Relief Society Building Elder Marvin O. Ash ton First Counselor, Presiding Bishopric SUCCESS to you in this building! May you speedily start, and may you speedily finish it. If we are perfectly honest with your, and sometimes we are, we would say something like this to President Spafford, "Success to you in this building," and, as the host said to those guests he had in the house as he went into the closet to take out their coats, "Here's your hat, but what's your hurry?" Our building over there is crowded. You need a new building and so do we need more elbow room. Success to you! I wish that every building that is financed would be financed as easily as you are going to finance this building; and I hope I have the privilege, and I am sure it won't be denied, to give my pittance in this direction. In closing, inasmuch as President Smith has mentioned the Lamanites, I just want to pay tribute to a Relief Society worker; namely. Sister Flora Hicks, who has had charge, with her husband, of the Lamanites in the Papago Ward, Arizona. She was called down there ten or twelve years ago, and she passed away about eight weeks ago. We had the privilege of standing in that house as those Lamanites came in to pay homage to her. They are supposed to be cold; they are not supposed to be very enthusiastic in their emotions. When those people came in, about three hundred strong, one at a time and in groups, they cried like babies in the loss of that wonderful woman and what she had done for them. And as they put her under the ground, the little Lamanite president of the Relief Society put fifty dollars in the hands of Brother Hicks. They heard that he had had some intention of moving back to Salt Lake City sometime. She said, "Here is fifty dollars, and men have another fifty dollars. That is for a monument to this good woman. You are not going to move her from this sacred soil?" God bless her memory. She gave herself to help other persons raise their standards of life. God bless you. Amen.
