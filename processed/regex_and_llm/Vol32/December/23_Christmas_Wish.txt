CHRISTMAS WISH Helen Kimball Orgill I wish I had dwelt in Bethlehem in that long ago, To greet those lonely strangers, with weary feet and slow. I wish I had been near Mary, her every wish to attend, To comfort and to love her, when needing most a friend. But these are vain desires, and never meant for me? Around are other pilgrims on life's upsurging sea. His heart is yearning over them?I hear again his plea: Ye do it to the least ones, ye do it unto me!
