Feed My Lambs" Presiding Bishop LeGrand Richards IT should not be hard to say something to a group like this. I love the Relief Society and I have reason to because I have served as bishop of three different wards, and I have said that I could get along as well without a first counselor as I could without the Relief Society president. We have been particularly privileged, the present Presiding Bishopric of the Church, to be able to labor as advisers to Sister Robison and her counselors, to Sister Lyman and her counselors, and now to Sister Spafford and her assistants. Recently our work has been divided so that we are only advisers in their temporal affairs and their work in caring for the poor and those in distress. We have learned to love and appreciate these women, and it is a delight to be here this morning, to listen to them, as I know it is to each one of you here present today. This is a wonderful Church! Yesterday we went to the temple, the General Authorities with the mission presidents, in a meeting that commenced at nine o'clock, and we left there at twenty minutes after five. GENERAL RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE 743 As I sat listening to the mission presidents bring back to the headquarters of the Church the spirit of the work that is being done under their direction, from the fringe of the Church, where the Church is expanding, I said to myself, "Well, if the Prophet Joseph had died for the establishment of the missionary system of this Church only, he surely would not have died in vain." Then to come here this morning and see this grand group of Relief Society workers, and let our minds go out to what is actually being done in the Church everywhere, I say again that if the Prophet Joseph had died for the establishment of the Relief Society organization of this Church only, he surely would not have died in vain. I want to remind you of one statement of the Master. You will remember how he gathered his followers from their nets and their fishes. After Jesus was crucified, Peter said, "I go fishing," and you remember that others of the disciples followed him, and then how Jesus came and found them when they were not successful in their fishing and he told them to cast their nets on the other side, and you know then the success that followed. And then Jesus said, directing himself to Peter: Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? (These fishes.) He saith unto him. Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him. Feed my lambs. He saith unto him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him. Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him. Feed my sheep. He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him. Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep (John 21:15-17). TAGW, sisters, I do not know anything in the world that we can do to more pleasingly demonstrate to our Father in heaven our love of him than feeding the sheep and the lambs of his fold. He has said that the good shepherd leaves the ninety and nine to go out after the one strayed away. We, from the Presidency down, are going to try in this Church to emphasize ward teaching as it has never been done before. We feel that we are becoming marvelously organized and equipped and qualified for doing our work within the sacred walls of our beautiful buildings, but there are many, many on every hand who do not gather to receive the word of God, that we must accentuate our effort and emphasize it, to go to the homes and there carry the message and the spirit of this great latter-day work about which you have been speaking this morning. The Relief Society has a program that parallels the great ward teaching program of the Church. You are messengers to the homes. I like that part of the Relief Society work, where it is done in the right spirit and by faithful and efficient women ?and we have thousands and tens of thousands of them in the Church today?who go into the homes of the Latter-day Saints, taking with them the spirit of the gospel, the spirit of Christ, looking after the lost ones and gathering in and helping and encouraging where encouragement is necessary. If the sisters of this great organization will unite in the spirit of the priesthood of the Church to try to awaken within the hearts of the Latter-day Saints, particularly in those who have been inactive and indifferent, a love of the truth, a devotion to God and his great latter-day work, I am sure we will see the work of God going on as it has never done before, and the day will come when we will learn how to do our work for the salvation and exaltation of our Father's children in a far better manner than we have ever done before. God bless each one of you in your various fields, in your wards and stakes, and give you vision and power and inspiration, that you may touch the hearts of your people, that you may arise in your great assignment to heights you have never dreamed of before, to the honor and glory of God and the blessing and the salvation of his children, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. ?Photograph courtesy Salt Lake Tribune. THREE GENERAL PRESIDENTS OF RELIEF SOCIETY President Amy Brown Lyman, 1940-1945; President Belle S. Spafford, 1945?-; President Louise Y.
