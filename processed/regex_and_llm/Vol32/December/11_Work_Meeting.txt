work meeting leader be appointed on stake boards and also in wards, to work under the general supervision of the counselor who is the work meeting program except directly responsible for all phases of the work meeting program except Church Welfare assignments which shall continue to be the direct responsibility of the counselor who is the work director. The stake work meeting leader shall be responsible for a department at union meeting to be attended by ward work-meeting leaders. Wards will plan the work-meeting day for themselves as heretofore, but the union meeting department should stimulate, encourage, suggest programs and aid wards in maintaining high standards of work-meeting activities.
Submittal of Annual Reports
Stake secretaries are requested to begin immediately to work toward getting annual reports into the General Office on time. Ward reports should reach stake secretaries not later than January 5. Stake secretaries should in turn submit their reports to the General Office not later than January 20. Sisters, we plead with you to see that these dates are met.
Stake officers are advised to remind ward officers that ward Relief Society conference programs should be planned with the purposes of the conference clearly in mind, namely, to report organization activities and accomplishments, to acquaint the ward membership with the program and needs of the Society, and to emphasize the blessings of membership in the organization. The ward conference is the Relief Society meeting from which Relief Society should derive benefits, and, with very few exceptions, it accomplishes its purposes best when presented by Relief Society women. The main goal of the meeting should not be merely to present a brilliant speaker or an entertaining program in order that a large crowd will be in attendance, but rather to present in a fresh, interesting, and appealing way a program that truly represents Relief Society, and that draws a large attendance because it does interestingly represent us. The work of Relief Society is appealing and dramatic in itself, and, if properly presented, is full of interest for ward members. Officers should not feel in making ward conference assignments that it is necessary to go outside the ward or stake for talent. The conference program provides excellent opportunity to use and develop local talent and to recognize capable, faithful Relief Society women. Every ward and stake has an abundance of excellent talent, if leaders will but search it out and make use of it. Support of No-Liquor-Tobacco Committees Suggestions will come from the General Board during the coming year in support of the efforts of the General No-Liquor-Tobacco Committee to abolish the use of alcohol and tobacco. We trust that stakes and wards will give full support to any programs that are released or projects that are initiated either by the Board or your local committees. Emphasis on Four Phases of Work We have been advised by our Church leaders to give renewed emphasis to four phases of our work: First, the ultimate objective of all that we do is to build testimonies of the truth of the restored gospel, and to teach women to apply the saving principles of the gospel in their every-day lives. Second, as Relief Society leaders, we must seek earnestly to spiritualize and strengthen Latter-day Saint homes. Third, we are counseled to take cognizance of our part in the Welfare Program of the Church. Love-inspired welfare service has been a fundamental part of our work since the very beginning of our existence as a Society. Under the impetus of the Church Welfare Plan, bishops are enabled to more fully discharge their part in relation to needy Church members in their wards, and Relief Society sisters, relieved of the necessity of maintaining a charity fund and serving as a source of supply, may more fully devote themselves to phases of the work that are in accord with their natures and ability. A fourth duty to which our attention has been called is that of bringing actively into Relief Society greater numbers of Latter-day Saint women, particularly young women. Every Latter-day Saint woman is entitled to the blessings of membership in this Society. Encouragement of Visiting Teaching We urge that special efforts be put forth to strengthen the visiting teacher program during the coming months. GENERAL RELIEF SOCIETY CONFERENCE 729 There is a need for organized effort to develop hopes and attitudes and sentiments, favorable outlook and points of view, the spirit of mutual purpose and co-operation; to implant religious conviction with its sustaining spiritual strength. Today's world offers such excellent opportunity for the intimate human service which our visiting teachers can render. May the Lord bless you to keep alive your sense of values, your sense of proportion, your faith that as you work unselfishly in this great organization, you are genuinely helping the women of this Church, you are helping to advance the work of the Lord.
