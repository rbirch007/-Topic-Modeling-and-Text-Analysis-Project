PRAYER OF THANKS Eva Willes Wangsgaard I?thanked thee other years, dear Lord, For flowers and fruit, For beauty that the years afford From seed and root. This year I thank thee for the peace That faith can hold, For love that grew a sheltering fleece Against all cold, And for the wound my heart received. J I murmured when It came, but learned that while I grieved I grew. Amen. He
