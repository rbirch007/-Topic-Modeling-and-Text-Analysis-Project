The Idaho Falls Temple Dedicated Possibly no more solemn nor glorious an occasion is offered to Latter-day Saints in mortality than the opportunity to attend the dedicatory services to our Heavenly Father of one of his temples. To those who were privileged to be present at any of the eight sessions held in conjunction with the dedication of the beautiful Idaho Falls Temple on September 23, 24, and 25, 1945, the memory will remain sacred to them forever. All the general authorities of the Church were in attendance throughout the three-day sessions and delivered impressive and moving addresses. An enveloping spirit of peace and thanksgiving entered into the hearts of the assembled saints and banished from their thoughts the worries and cares of this world. The veil separating this world from the hereafter seemed thin indeed. During the great dedicatory prayer by President George Albert Smith, all the congregation united in fervent supplication to the Father that the petitions sought for and the blessings invoked in the dedicatory prayer might be granted. In deep humility many firm resolutions were silently made to join more ardently in the future in the necessary work of welding the chain of the human family back to Father Adam. When the reminder was sounded, "And he (Elijah) shall plant in the hearts of Page 664 the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers. If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming," the thought was awakened that each time a new temple is erected the warning note of Malachi's prophecy, as quoted to the Prophet Joseph Smith by Moroni, becomes less dread. Following the inspiring dedicatory prayer, those present at each session joined in the Hosanna Shout, and ensuing beautiful musical selections served to impart a feeling of heavenly benediction on the scene. As the saints reluctantly left at the conclusion of a session, involuntarily many eyes were drawn back for a final glimpse of the mural opposite the entrance to the temple. This painting, portraying Christ standing in an attitude of welcome to those entering, seemed to impose a feeling of personal obligation to perform temple work with renewed zeal. From a prayerful study of the proceedings of the dedicatory services of the Idaho Falls Temple, may Latter-day Saints everywhere be inspired to so order their lives that the blessings and promises which are obtainable only in a house of the Lord may be bestowed on them and their children in mortality, to be fully realized in the eternities to come. -M.

And never these petitions, and accept the dedication of this house unto thee, the work of our hands, which we have built unto hy name; And also this Church, to put upon it thy name. And help us by the power of throne, with acclamations of praise, singing Hosanna to God and the Lamb And let these, thine anointed ones be clothed with salvation, and thy saints shout aloud for joy. Amen, and Amen. (Doctrine and Covenants, 109:78-80). From the inspired dedicatory prayer offered by the Prophet Joseph Smith in the Kirtland Temple March 27, 1836, preceding the Hosanna Shout which has since become a traditional feature of the dedication of all Latter-day Saint temples.
