A NIGHT WITH THE WIND Lottie Hammer Singley Oh, could there be a thing more drear, more doleful Than wind with a coyote's voice and phantom sound That breaks upon the shadowed realm of night Like some wild, questing thing unbound? He strums weird tunes upon my open shutter, And morbidly he flutes my chimney pipe. Chants mournful dirges round my cottage corner; North Wind, be still, just for tonight! In fitful tones the strain continues. With tom-tom beats, he drums upon my sill. Makes windowpanes his clanging cymbals Till sun calls out a fervent ?Peace be still." Page 711 TIDE Myrtle E. Henderson I watch the tide come in on Monterey Bay? The tide come in from the ocean gray; It surges and leaps up over the land, Then slowly recedes with its burden of sand; But the tide leaves the seaweed, the jellyfish, crab-In colors of rose-pink, white, dark green, and drab, And there's beauty in some beyond words to compare In the sea dollar's star and the clamshell rare. Some are fragments, broken and torn apart. Mute tokens of beauty in nature's lost art; They are left on the beach where we frolic and play Wlien the tide has gone out on Monterey Bay. Is the tide like our lives from some ocean beyond. Fathomless, deathless, going eternally on. Each wave a new life as it breaks on the surf And contributes its bit?good or bad?to the earth? Some lives are mere symbols of what might have been. And others are wrecked by their burden of sin, But some lives there are with a perfect design Like my sea dollar's star, my clam's luster and Tine. They have given their best, be it great, be it small. And unselfishly served for the good of us all; When their tides go out and their sands slip away. There is more beauty left than I found in the Bay. Page 712 The Beloved King James Version ??
