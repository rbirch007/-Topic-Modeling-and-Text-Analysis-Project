The Star Burns Bright Sibyl Spande Bowen Sibyl Spande Bowen, a gifted Latter-day Saint writer, died in August 1945. AAN MA written many excellent stories and articles for TheHer serial, "The Shining Heart," was featured in 1939. THE woman almost closed the cabin door against the rising wind before she saw the dim figure plodding through the snow-clogged path toward her. She hustled Martha into a big kitchen, warm with lamplight and red shafts from the grate of the big stove. The girl stood silent, dazed with the sudden heat. Seena Furnstrom's big hands unwound the girls muffler, took off her heavy coat, and pushed her gently into the black rocker. "Tou, Miss Dexter, why aind't you wit' party you go for, over Christmas?" Martha pulled off her gloves, and brushed snow from the aura of pale yellow hair that escaped under the band of her parka hood. There was blue fire in her angry eyes. "Why!" she exploded, "because Fm just Martha Dexter, the girl who smiles when her date passes her up, the slow-witted blond who doesn't mind being a poor second to the measles of the Jenks twins or to the boil on Sven Neilson's neck-but this time I'm through." Seena had a cup of hot soup from her ever-boiling black kettle to offer with her soothing cluck, "Now, Miss Dexter, the doctor make you so mad many times, but you always get glad right soon. He has to go when people is sick, huh?" Martha waved the soup cup excitedly. "People! People, yes! Seena, this time it was a horse. He takes me, Martha Dexter, twenty miles through the snow to a house party, and then leaves me flat. 'So sorry, darling,' he says, 'but Bill Hal-ton's horse is sick."" She remembered the soup and salted it with the sudden tears of her rage. "I came back on the mail sled." 'All Halton's horses cost money," Seena commented mildly, and turned a pair of big fur-lined boots to the fire glow. She drew a note from the pocket of her checkered gingham apron and handed it to the girl slumped in the big chair. "This telegram... Ole brought it up from the toll station last night." At first it was just words, scrawled in Mrs. Todd's uncertain hand. Then Martha sat up, her eyes determined, spots of red in her cheeks. She noted the lined boots, the sheepskin coat, the robes, warming before the fire. "Ole going out for freight-Christmas Eve?" Her voice was high with excitement. "Christmas Eve, yes." There was a flare of old resentment in Seena's words, then she was stolid again. "Sure, when the freight comes, Ole got to get it, or lose his job." But Martha scarcely heard her. She jumped up and hugged Seena excitedly. "I'm going with him. Seena, this telegram?from Herbert. He's on his way from Chicago, and hell wait for me at Junction?one Page  day. Darling, I'm getting out of here. Wolf Hill School will be minus one slave-driven teacher, all six grades of it. Fm meeting Herbert." SEENA'S broad face was cool, faintly scornful. 'That thin feller that drove you up here last fall? Him with the hay fever and wearing everything to match?" Martha's face flamed. "Yes, and with the sense to live in a place where the lights go on with switches instead of matches, where you don't have to carry the heat in in a wood hod, and where the water comes out of faucets instead of from a bucket of melted snow! Oh, I'm sorry, Seena. You and Ole have been the best ever to live with, but I can't take it. I can't imagine why I ever had the notion I wanted to run away from Herb!" Suddenly, she turned on Seena. "And don't tell me the doctor won't like it. Fm sick and tired of hearing what Doctor Peter Thorne won't like." Seena turned a scornful back. T"HE road was a fenceless, pathless blur under the runner's of Ole Furnstrom's bobsled. The twilight deepened to the monotonous jingle of the sleigh bells, to the soft hiss of snowflakes that steamed suddenly on the hot stove pipe that was thrust out from the rear vent of the covered sleigh. Martha, snuggled beside the round little stove inside the box, swaddled in one of Seena's good sheepskin robes, fed another stick of quaking aspen to the stove and pulled aside the canvas flap to take one last look at the valley before the road wound into the narrows. The valley! Plodding through eternal snowdrifts to the blizzard-swept little school on the ridge five times a week. Coming back to Ole's gray cabin to shiver or roast over the woodburner, malodorous of green quaking aspen, until Seena's never-fail supper of fried pork, potatoes, and dried-apple pie was ready. The valley! Dances in the chilly, barnlike structure with young men who bored her?young men who stood about the dance hall while the girls huddled around the rusty stove hoping to be rescued from the wallflower bench by one of these rustic swains! Martha lifted her face defiantly. This was all behind her. Ahead was Herbert, safe, cautious, civilized... Herbert The sleigh lurched to a stop, throwing Martha to her hands and knees. She shouted to Ole, who sat in the front seat in his sheepskin coat, scorning the heated interior. "What's the matter?" "A man," Ole returned stolidly, and waited. In the grayish gloom of snow-filled air a lantern bobbed, swung in a signal by the darker bulk behind it. A voice shouted, "Hey there!" The figure plowed through the drifts and approached the sleigh, hauling up the canvas unceremoniously. "A woman," he said in surprise, looking into the warm interior, "just what I was waiting for." He reached in, took Martha's suitcase in his free hand and bawled, "End of the line. Everybody out." Martha made angry efforts to stay the suitcase, then scrambled over the front seat. "If this is your idea of a joke, you.... I?m on my way out of the valley, and we've got to keep going or we won't meet the stage at Halfway House, and I won't get home for Christmas..."
She stopped, struck by the ridiculous likeness of her tale to the story of the "Old Woman and the Pig."
But the man with the lantern was already plowing through the snow of the trail back. "Come on, come on, Marty, and no back talk. Women don't grow on fence posts around here, and right now I need one, and while you're not exactly the one I'd have picked from a crowd, you'll do in a pinch."
Martha caught her breath sharply. "I might have known?the good old team-roller method. Everybody's wrong but you, Doctor Thorne. Ole!" she called.
Ole was flintlike. "The Doc, he need you. You better go, Miss Dexter. There'll be another stage another day."
MARTHA was out, stepping along into prints the man ahead of her made in the deep snow. She heard him shout back to Ole Fornstrom. "Drive along and tell Mrs. Perkes I want her here by morning, or else."
Morning! Martha's anger flared, but she plodded along. It was a good quarter mile through the drifts down to the cabin by the frozen river. Doctor Thorne reached it ahead of the girl, and held the slab door open until Martha stumbled in, furred to the waist with new snow, her breath gasping her strained lungs, her pale hair about her face a rim of white. She leaned against the door, easing her breath-ing, seeing the room like a misty picture.
Two shaggy-haired children, a boy and a girl, hugging the ancient kitchen woodburner, stared at her with unwinking, round blue eyes. A smoke - streaked "factory" cloth, tacked to the walls and low ceiling, was torn in places from the rough logs it covered. The furniture was makeshift, a carpet-covered couch in the corner behind the stove; packing box cupboards curtained by the same red print that hung limply over the tiny window.
Peter Thorne unwrapped himself like a tall cocoon from his tar-lined leather coat and helmet?Peter Thorne, red-haired, blue-eyed, and quite as unembarrassed as if the girl he had just kidnaped had never known his arms about her, his forth-right kiss upon her lips, had never flung his ring back to him just last night. ("So you won't marry me, huh," he had said. "Well, don't say I didn't warn you about what you're missing when you change your mind, darling.")
Peter Thorne completed his unwinding operations. "Off with the fuzzies, Martha. Kids, this pretty lady is your new cook. Marty, she kids haven't had any supper, and neither have I."
MARTHA just stood there, confused and angry; her impulse was to turn and run. Then from the other side of an inner slab door came a moan that rose to a shrill height, then died away. Doctor Thorne grinned, on the wry side. "The stork is flying, Miss Dexter, frostbitten and snowbound, but on the job. So you see this isn't just a little game to annoy you. This is the trapper, Lafe Higgins' place, and of course he chose just this time to haul out a load of his kids. Buster, here, caught me just as I finished with Bill Halton's horse." The tallest towhead, the boy, offered in a timid voice, ?Top's going to find Santy in Junction and tell him to bring us sumpin." Peter Thorne looked at Martha with challenging eyes that were steel under the copper crest of his hair, and hard as the metal itself. "That's great, kids," he said, "now show Miss Marty where things are. She's going to be very, very busy," he finished significantly. And he turned to the slab door and left Martha. She looked at the children in despair. At the rise of the moans from the next room, panic rose to dry her throat. A baby being born.... And she, Martha Dexter, was here to face it with nobody else but Peter Thorne. There was water to boil, gallons and gallons of it, all reduced from the pails of snow Martha laboriously dug out and carried in. There were old sheets, instruments, to sterilize, with Peter Tliorne darting in from the bedroom to give his orders like a booming top sergeant. There was the stove to feed? always the stove to feed, from the frozen pile of aspen near the back door. The pile was just beyond a little cut spruce that leaned against the side of the house. Twice Martha passed the little spruce tree, twice she turned away from its mute appeal. ""As if I didn't have enough to do. Chances are it isn't even set in a stool," she i; aid to the wind. But Buster, tugging at his sticks of aspen, told her. "Pop put it handy, so Santy could trim it when he comes." Behind her a sardonic voice said, "Run up your ladder to bed, kids. Miss Marty is too busy to fuss around with Christmas trees." And when the doctor came out from beyond the slab door the next time, Martha was defiantly brushing snow from the branches of the tree triumphantly upright in the corner. "Not one of the vital necessities around here just now," he murmured. "It is vital," Martha insisted, "because when Mrs. Perkes gets here-well, you know Mrs. Efficiency Perkes.' " Peter Thorne stepped to the window and pulled aside the limp calico curtain. The snow lashed furiously against the small panes. "Relax, darling," he said, "and see what the weather man has brought us. Ole won't take his feet out of Mrs. Perke's oven until this blizzard blows over, and Lafe Higgins is no doubt holed up at Halfway House for the same reason." Halfway House! Furious tears splashed the cotton angel Martha jabbed onto the tree. The doctor was behind her, "You never hang an angel upside down," he reproved mildly, "and anyway, doesn't it seem a waste of energy to leave the valley on Christmas Day when you must be back in less than a week?" MARTHA groped in her pocket and found the crumpled evidence of Herbert's telegram. Unsteadily she thrust it into the hand that touched her own. Silence followed. Young Doctor Thorne made another prolonged stay in the room beyond the closed door, and just when Martha's heart was unevenly not sure she had scored, he came back into the room THE STAR BURNS BRIGHT 673 with a soft, too gentle, "So you're quitting." That was the way he said it?just as if she were running away, craven-ly, without cause. Nothing about the battle of snowdrifts, the loneliness, the struggle with six grades of badly-trained, indifferent children who really did not care a mangy sheep for the foundation stones of learning. Pink battle flags stained Martha's cheeks. ?Yes," she cried, stung, 'I'm quitting. Quitting a log cabin for a heated apartment. Quitting a snowbound hole in the hills for a place where a library isn't considered a sign of corruption. Yes, Doctor, I'm quitting." Outrageously, tears filled her eyes, so that she must turn back to the tree to fumble with a string of paper stars. Peter stirred at his boiling instrument pan. "And I thought," he said softly, "that given time you might figure out how Wolf Hill might someday have a library, too." "I'm going home." It had b-come a battle cry. "Okay, you're going home. But first you're stoking the fire and we're scrubbing up. The bird is perching right on the chimney," the red-haired doctor snapped, and somehow all the banter had left with the look he gave the girl. At last he believed her. BIRTH is a grim thing. There is sweat and anguish, the sharp cry of pain that seems unbearable, but is not. There is suspense that wears to agony, and the urgent need to do something, only to find that little can be done. Martha stood powerless in the midst of hours that had no end, her mouth dry with fear of this thing. But she heard the woman's words. "Their stockings," the woman said, "musn't forget to put them out. They're in the...." Her rising shriek almost drowned her words. But Martha scrambled away. She can think of things like Christmas stockings when she's going through that, she told her amazed self. And then, somehow, it was over. The mother was asleep with that smile that made her kin to all the madonnas, and Martha and Peter crept into the kitchen, to stand staring at each other, as if they had shared a miracle almost too intimately; staring at the wooden cradle where the new baby slept, his tiny face wrinkled solemnly. Abruptly, Martha turned toward the window and looked out. Peter followed her, and parted the curtains wider. The hush of the room about them was part of the white silence without, a silence in which the very wind and storm had stilled. In a rift of the clouds a single star shone like a new-minted piece of silver. "That star," Martha said, all the tide of her unshed tears in her voice, "it's so bright, so alone. It might be The Star, on this night." Peter Thorne said, "It is The Star, Marty. Often it shines, and I like to think that it guides the feet of someone who has lost his way." "Lost his way?" "Yes, Martha. You're all wrong, you know, dear. You don't want that steam-heated apartment?and Herbert. You want the storm and strife of things up here. You want..." the voice of Peter was very close, and if she but moved, his lips would be on her cheek. "... Did you know you were wonderful tonight?" MARTHA moved away, not sure of the tumult that pounded in her heart. Rebellious questions were on her lips, until she pulled the curtains violently to shut out the calm rays of the star. But when she turned, Peter Thome was not there. He was stretched out fast asleep on the lumpy surface of the old couch. "So that's as much as it means to him! Sound asleep!" Tired tears washed* her cheeks as Martha found her coat, her suitcase, and floundered up the snow-ridden trail to the road?the road gray in the faint dawn, and creaking under the runners of Ole Furnstrom's sleigh. Mrs. Perkes beamed from her hood. "How did things go. Miss Dexter? I was ready to go down last night, but the doctor said, when he passed my place, there was no need. He wanted to get you used to the run of the thing, seein' as you was to be Mrs. Doctor." Martha staggered limply to the sleigh and got in while Mrs. Perkes landed her round self in the snow. "Oh, yes," she answered dazedly, "things went all right. They do with Doctor Thome, you know." The utter, unbelievable nerve of him! "He's remarkable, ain't he?" the smiling nurse agreed as she bobbed into the snow. Remarkable. The remarkable Doctor Thome. Martha chanted the words to the rhythmic sway of Ole's sled. She sat on a sheepskin with her chin in her knees and thought of Herbert, fuming in the drab discomfort of Junction House. She thought of Peter Thorne, of the sardonic blue eyes, the flaming crest and the salty tongue. She thought of the mother who took time out of her agony to remember her children's Christmas stockings, of the faithful trekking of Ole Furnstrom, who went on Christmas Day, that the lonely farmsteads of Wolf Hill might have their needed goods. She thought of a man who left a party to minister to a sick horse?Bill Halton's horse, that cost good money. Never once did she think of Martha Dexter, whose comfort had been so all-important. "The Star burns bright," she said suddenly, and heard the pound of feet in soft snow behind her. "If Ole weren't so soft about his horses I'd never have made it," Peter Thorne panted, scrambling in under the canvas. Martha could not look at him, but her mind saw him. Unshaven, blue eyes hollow in a tired face, a crooked grin. "I don't blame you for being sore, Marty, but I've got to tell you how sorry I am for dragging you in on last night. I... [had a fool notion that seeing life in the raw... You might like to live it with me." Martha pleated the wet cuff of her glove, and was silent. The crooked grin faded a bit. "Won't you say something? I'm a hardy hulk myself. I forget that everybody doesn't dote on the great open spaces where plumbing is something out of a catalogue, and... Well, hang it all, I guess a fellow like Herbert has more to offer a lovely girl like you than a back-country pill-shooter... Here, we're at the toll station. You can call Herbert and..." THE STAR BURNS BRIGHT Martha was looking at him now, a bit of the light of stars in her blue eyes. 'Tete-?" the name was natural on her lips?"don't tell me ever again what you have to offer me. It's what I have to offer you, and Wolf Hill, and Lafe Higgins' kids, and the Furnstroms, and... Oh, Pete, what a narrow escape I had. Just think if you, and that Star, 675 hadn't reached out and grabbed me and set me right?Peter, are you listening?" The words were breathless, almost pleading. A man's two arms about the girl he loves can be definitely more satisfying than any words ever spoken, but Peter risked a few. "Darling, what do you think?" was all he said.
