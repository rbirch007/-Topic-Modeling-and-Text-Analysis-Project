WAITING SPRING MabeJ Jones Gahhott The days of garnering from fields and trees Are finished. On my shelves in jaunty rows Are bright tomatoes, amber peaches, peas, And somber grapes and jams. Now autumn goes To join the season's great processional, Her russet cloak already brown and sere; Fall winds and rain sing earth's recessional. Soon winter's ermine garment will appear. And in this time of ending tasks and sleep, And seeming death, when dormant seeds in dry Cool places wait the spring's return and keep Their silent tryst with earth and winter, I Too, wait, rich memories stored within my heart, Until our spring, when we no longer part.
