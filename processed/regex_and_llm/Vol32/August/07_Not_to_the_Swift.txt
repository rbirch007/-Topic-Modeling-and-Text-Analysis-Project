Not to the Swift Olive M. Nicholes ELSA WAYNE sat huddled beside her husband in the high wagon seat, cradling her sleeping baby in the curved shelter of her weary body. The wagon tossed and rolled like a ship in a heavy sea as it toiled over boulders or floundered through the engulfing sand. Dust rolled up from the wheels ahead of them, from the wheels behind them,  an inescapable red cloud, the length of the wagon train. It mingled with the yell of teamsters, the crack of whips and the patient plod of many hoofs.
She glanced up at the man beside her. All the familiar contours of his features were hidden in a wilderness of beard. He turned gentle eyes upward and reached out a comforting hand.
"We're almost theyah, honey. You'll nevah regret comin', once you see the land. Theyah's no end to it. It's like Alabamy an' Cal'liny good cotton country. It'll be home, honey, the Dixie of Deseret."
"Not my home!" she muttered with stiff lips.
Oh, no; not her home! She glared about at the unfamiliar landscape as the dust rolled away and the wheels bit into the solid black lava of the ancient flow winding its tortuous way from the sleeping volcanoes to the northwest. Far to the northeast gigantic blocks and pinnacles were tumbled together in a gorgeous welter of color. Vermillion, bright ochre, orange, mauve and purple glowed and shifted in the sunlight.
She clung with terror to the man whose rapturous gaze shut her away, out of his new life.
"Jim," she choked, "what is it? Let me see, too!"
He turned and took her in his arms, "Theyah now, honey, ain't no call fo' you all to be afeared. It'll all look different in fifty yeahs. Homes an' farms an' cattle fillin' up the valleys. I reckon they'll be churches an' schools an' a temple, too."
Fifty years! Her weary eyes searched for a glimpse of familiar substance. The mountains where were her mountains?
Mountains lay at the core of her being. Born and reared in Switzerland, she had become a part of their permanence and beauty. They embodied the undeniable triumph of righteousness. It had been the vision of mountains that had swept her into the new religion among a peculiar people in a faraway land.
The Valleys of the Mountains! That had been her acolyte. It had lifted her up through privation, hunger and despair, from Missouri to Nauvoo, from Winter Quarters to the West.
She had met Jim at Winter Quarters, a convert just from the South. She had been drawn to him as to a magnet, big, dark, and handsome, with a swift, rare smile and a voice at once slow and decisive. He had been attracted by her vibrancy and fair, shy beauty. Her eyes had been a corn-flower blue, her red hair with promise. Her sunny hair had hung in a flaxen rope, as big as his wrist, almost to her knees. Page 461 She had been full of hope, then. She had been the one to encourage and sustain. Her unquenchable laughter and sweet singing had captivated everyone on that April morning when they joined the caravan. She, who had faced incredible suffering with fortitude, cringed, now, in abject fear. CHE rolled back the curtain of the years and plodded again behind the handcart. The brazen sunlight beat down from a bow! Of blue glass. The baked earth held it and threw it back, intensified, against their aching bodies. Jim, already sick and faint with hunger, staggered and dropped in the trail. The cart behind turned out and rejoined the one ahead. The last of the few wagons, carrying the sick and dying, rolled by, the driver leaning to her with a comforting word. She had not begged for a place for Jim. She knew without asking there would be no room. So many sick, so many dying, and now Jim! There had been a tangled clump of bushes, a heap of broken rocks, where a persistent trickle of water bubbled up to be swallowed, instantly, by the thirsty sand. She pulled Jim into the meager shade and rolled the handcart alongside the embankment to shield him from the merciless sun. Then, piling the bedding and sacks of clothing on the hard ground, she eased him tenderly to the makeshift bed. The driver of the "sick-wagon" limped back and propped a shovel against the cart. He bent over the sick man, felt his pulse, then straightened up and started across the shimmering prairie. He had loved Jim as a brother. They had come up from the south together, poling their way on a flat-boat, crawling on hands and knees through thicket and swamp. Now he turned and staggered away with a hopeless sag to his shoulders. The living must go on! She had watched him top the rise and disappear. She had turned, then, searching the vast sweep of prairie with anguished eyes. Not a moving thing in sight., "O God, spare my Jim," she begged, kneeling beside the sick man and clasping his hot fingers in her own. She gathered a few dead twigs and leaves and set a tin cup of water over the blaze she had kindled from tinder and flint. She would scald some scorched crusts and perhaps the tang of the hot liquid would staunch the ebbing tide of strength. If there were only a piece of beef to make a nourishing broth! They had seen no meat in weeks. They dared not go in search of game; lone huntsmen fell easy prey to skulking Indians. Indians! The thought crashed into her consciousness . She heard no sound, but they slid up around her, thirty or more, hideous with war paint, filthy with grease and grime. All thought of self was swallowed up in her misery for Jim. Now she could die with him. She rose and faced them in dazed expectancy. A big buck stalked to her side, his one good eye focused on the man on the ground. He pointed to Jim. "Heap sick," he grunted, squatting down beside the cart, and squinting into the dying face. She nodded, stupefied with wonder that she could be alive at all. His black eye swept over the cart with beady interrogation. From an exposed corner of the box a torn pillowcase displayed the bright embroidered folds of her great-grandmother's table cloth.
"Gimme," he demanded, snatching the gorgeous linen from its wrappings. He shook out the gay fringed length of it and watched it dip and ripple about his feet.
She felt instinctively that he understood English better than he would admit. He seemed familiar with the skillet, the pots and pans, the canister of salt and sugar. Somewhere, sometime, his contact with the white man had been merciful and kind.
He unfastened a buckskin pouch at his belt and sifted a fine trickle of dried leaves into the water, simmering on the dying embers. A pungent aroma billowed up with the steam as he tilted the cup back and forth to mix the darkening liquid. Satisfied, at last, he raised it to his lips and blew a gale of breath into the scalding brew. He gulped a swallow and squinted up at her.
"Heap big medicine," he grunted, stooping over Jim. He poured the stimulating draught between the parched lips. The liquid bubbled and welled out. The Indian clamped Jim's lips together in the vise of his cupped palm until the overflow seeped slowly back. He poured in more and more until only the gray leaves fringed the cup.
The dying eyelids flickered and drew apart. Recognition broke through the glazed film of death. The stiff jaws worked and the broken mouthful of soundless words
She flung herself down beside him and gathered him into her hungry arms while the circle of impatient eyes darted from the heap of bright embroidery to the buckskin pouch and back again.
"Gimme," the Indian demanded, snatching up the cloth and depositing the pouch in her lap.
"Yes, yes!" she choked, nodding her head in vigorous affirmation, so that her sunbonnet fell back and dropped to the ground. The flaxen web of her hair escaped and flowed over her shoulders and billowed around her feet.
Thirty pairs of gimlet eyes bored into her scalp. An excited clamor arose. The big chief snarled a command and they shrank back against the hill as motionless as the rocks.
The chief stooped and clutched handfuls of the silken skeins and pressed them against his face.
"Gimme! Gimme!" he shouted, his one eye alight with greedy anticipation.
She laid Jim's head tenderly on the pillows and drew the blanket over his relaxed and sleeping body. Was it not enough that God had taken him back to her, that he would reach the mountains? Should she risk their lives and lose all with exclaim! demands? Her people were starving, dying on their scanty rations. They must have meat for their wasted bodies if they were to reach the Valley and work for the redemption of Zion. How much dare she ask? Her thoughts flew wildly about like startled birds, beating their wings against the cage of her exhausted brain.
The old chief spoke to his braves who stripped themselves of ornaments and laid them at his feet. He pressed them into her arms until beads and shells and feathered finery spilled over her knees in a rainbow flood of color. "No want,  she cried, springing up and crowding the barter into his reluctant hands. "Meat meat plenty meat!" Her arms swept a wide arc of abundance. He slammed the trinkets at her feet and jerked a knife from its beaded scabbard. "No meat/" he snarled, "no can find meat." Across the prairie a cloud of dust spurted up from an arroyo as a thousand buffalo hoofs scrambled to the plains above. A shaggy, black mass, scarcely discernible in the distant haze, rumbled slowly out of sight behind a low hill. "See! See!" she shrieked, gesticulating madly. "Meat plenty meat!" The disgruntled savages turned in wonderment, stiffened and sprang to life. The old chief barked commands as they scrambled for their possessions and disappeared behind the hill. "No kill! No take!" she demanded of the waiting chief as she gathered her hair together and divided it into strands. Her knees turned to jelly and her legs threatened to crumble under them when Jim muttered in his sleep. She stiffend to his need and then began to plait the strands of her hair toether, her sensitive finger-tips guiding the intricate pattern until she could pull the thick rope of it over her shoulder and braid it to its tapering end. Drawing a buckskin thong from her pocket, she knotted it securely at the nape of her neck and motioned for the Indian's knife. At her signal he leaped forward and grasped the completed braid, slipping the knife between her hair prickling scalp. She felt the cold steel pressed against her flesh, heard the squeal of the blade slicing through the resisting strands. He stepped back with a satisfied grunt and held up the severed prize. He fastened it to his scalp-lock, swung the embroidered cloth over his shoulders, and strutted away to retrieve his pony from the broken rocks. She watched the old savage ride off in the wake of his diminishing braves, her great-grandmother's tablecloth billowing out beneath her flaxen braid that whipped out frantically in the wind. She turned and rekindled the fire and made fresh brew from the strange herb. She repacked their possessions, concealing the shovel from Jim's questioning eyes. Please, God, let it dig no more graves in the lonely trail! At last the long day wore itself out. Cool breezes whispered through the sunburned prairie grass. Jim awakened from his healing sleep. "The Indians! Elsa was it a dream? I can't recall " "No, mine Jim," she whispered, tears splattering down on the thin hands that stroked her cheek. She jerked off her sunbonnet to confirm the wild tale. "Oh, my brave Elsa, my ," he had staggered giddily to his feet and held her close in his wasted arms. He had been proud of her then. He had boasted of her courage to the terrified band hiding in the willows by the river when she and Jim had staggered into camp with the incredulous news. The company had seen the In-(Continued on page 496)
