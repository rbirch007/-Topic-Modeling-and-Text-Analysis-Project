FARMER Christie Lund Coles Here is a man who loves the earth. Who loves the duties each day brings  The plowing and planting who knows the worth Of sun and rain and all growing things. Here is a man who will not leave The soil... For it is his very life. As much a part of him. As belief * In God, or in his child, or wife. Here is a man who comes at night To unload his wagon, water his team, Sure that ultimates will be right, A dreamer this, who has found his dream.
