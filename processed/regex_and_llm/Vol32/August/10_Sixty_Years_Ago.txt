Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponent, August 1 and August 15, 1885 "For the Rights of the Women of Zion and the Rights of the Women of All Nations" Editorial: Ulysses Simpson Grant. General U. S. Grant, a great military hero of the late civil war, and ex-President of the United States died at Mount MacGregor, on the morning of the 23rd of July last... The General died surrounded by his loved ones, and in the full enjoyment of the greatness he had himself achieved. He had the unusual honor of being twice elected to the highest position in the gift of the people of this nation.... Memorial services in his honor will be held in all parts of the United States. The Fair Silk Department: Here were worms eating away their green leaves, some spinning, fresh cocoons from this year; seven pounds of silk, some reeled, some spun and colored... Six different kinds of silk cloth... One lovely piece of changeable crimson and blue dress goods... Thirteen yards of purple and white, twelve yards of pink and white. All of the above is entirely Christena and Eliza Forsgren's own work, from the green mulberry leaf to the last stitch in making it up. Miscellaneous: Live near to God, and so all things will appear to you little in comparison with eternal realities. Good temper, like a sunny day, sheds a brightness over everything. It is the sweetener of toil and the soother of disquietude. ASPIRATIONS OF THE SOUL Teach me to know the mystic art Of drawing near to Thee! Teach me to know eternal life. By being one with Thee! Savior, I bring my soul to Thee, Disrobed from things of time; Teach me but with Thine holy touch And seal me ever Thine.  Hannah T. King Editorial Notes: The circular of the Brigham Young Academy... Has been received, and glancing through it we find everything is taught there that is desirable for the young people to learn. Arts and sciences, music, and needlework are included. There is also a Theological Department conducted with the utmost care.... Professor Karl G. Maeser is principal of the institution. He has had a long and wide experience as a teacher and is profoundly thoughtful as well as educationally proficient on all subjects mental, moral and spiritual. Note: The first women's hospital in China has been opened at Shanghai. It is called the Margaret Wilson Memorial Hospital. Editorial: If we cannot acknowledge the hand of an all-wise Parent in the discoveries of science today, I fear that darkness will overwhelm us again; and if it does it will be because of our stupidity in not acknowledging the hand of God in all things.... I would advise those who wish to treat the subject indifferently, to read the thirteenth chapter of St. Matthew, beginning at the thirty-eighth verse, and reflect. Page 468
