BEFORE DAWN Beatrice Knowlton Ekman We are to make the attack at dawn, Gray fog from the gray sea's face will rise; Grim is the work we have taken on, Bloody the path that before us lies. Rain-wet, the darkness around us creeps, Silence broods over the sleeping men? A longing for the homeland over me sweeps Where the soul can sing itself free again... * * * The bladed corn gleamed in the noonday heat When I rode away from my father's door. Past the golden fields of the ripened wheat * And beyond the hill... Then this alien shore. Tonight in the darkness my thoughts wing home To the fragrant meadows where killdeers cry... To tree-fringed acres of harrowed loam Under cloud-patterned shadows of western sky... At the wheat field's end I climb the stile To walk in the shade of the locust lane. From the pasture the milch cows slowly file And the sunset reddens the west again. To the east, blue mountains notch the sky And farmlands reach up to the foothill's side. To the west, going home, the gray gulls fly Where the inland waters are crimson dyed. The herd boy fastens the pasture bars And birds in the hedges drowsily fret. The night will be clear with an arc of stars For the west still burns where the sun has set. Through deepening shadows the swift creek flows Splashing the footbridge that sways with the strain; Through lace-curtained windows the lamplight glows On white moths futilely beating the pane... Rain-wet, the darkness around us creeps, Silence broods over the sleeping men? A longing for the homeland over me sweeps Where the soul can sing itself free again....
