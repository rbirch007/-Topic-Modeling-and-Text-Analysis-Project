Missions to the Indians Elder A. William Lund Assistant Church Historian 

Corrected OCR Transcription
THE translation and publication of the Book of Mormon, a record of a part of Israel on this continent (now known as the American Indians), created a great desire on the part of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the early elders of the Church to visit some of the remnants of the Lamanites (as designated in the Book of Mormon) and preach the gospel to them and give them copies of the Book of Mormon. Upon making inquiry of the Lord respecting this matter, the Prophet, in October 1829, received the following:
And now, concerning my servant Parley P. Pratt, behold, I say . . . I have appointed unto him that he shall go with my servants Oliver Cowdery and Peter Whitmer, Jun., into the wilderness among the Lamanites. And Ziba Peterson also shall go with them yea, even as I have said, so it shall be. (D. & C. 32:1)
Making immediate preparations for their mission, these four elders visited some encampments of Indians near the city of Buffalo, New York, where they spent some time instructing them in the knowledge of their forefathers. These Indians were of the Cattaraugus tribe, and they received the brethren kindly. As some of their number could read English, two copies of the Book of Mormon were left with them. These elders continued their journey westward, preaching in the different villages through which they passed. At Kirtland, Ohio, they tarried some time, where quite a number in that vicinity believed their testimony and came forward and obeyed the gospel. Among these were Sidney Rigdon and a large portion of the church over which he presided. These missionaries were very successful in their labors and organized a small branch of the Church in Kirtland. One of these converts, Dr. Frederick G. Williams, accompanied the missionaries to Missouri.
After leaving Kirtland, on their journey westward, they visited the Wyandot tribe of Indians near Sandusky, Ohio, with whom they spent several days. "We were well received," writes Elder Parley P. Pratt, "and had an opportunity laying before them the record of their forefathers, which we did. They rejoiced in the tidings, bid us godspeed and desired us to write to them in relation to our success among the tribes farther west, who had already removed to the Indian territory, where these expected to go."
On arriving at Independence, two of the company secured employment, while the other three crossed the frontier and began their labors among the Indians. They visited the Shawnees, spending one night with them, and the next day crossed the Kansas River and began their labors among the Delawares. They sought an interview with the chiefog the Delawares, known among the whites as Chief Anderson. Page  He was the ruler of ten nations or tribes, and consequently possessed great influence among the Indians. He had always opposed the introduction of missionaries among his people, and therefore did not at first extend a very hearty welcome to the brethern. Through an interpreter the brethren made known their errand and explained to him the Book of Mormon and the information it contained for his people. They asked to be heard before a full council of his nation, a proposition which the chief took under consideration until the next day. Next morning the conversation with the chief was renewed, but he was not inclined at first to call the council. As he began to understand better the nature 'of the Book of Mormon, he changed his mind and asked the brethren to suspend their conversation until the council could be assembled. A runner was dispatched to the tribes and in about an hour forty leading men were assembled and seated in grave silence to hear the message concerning the book of their forefathers. Oliver Cowdery, at the request of the chief, addressed the assembly. He told them that a history of their people had been faithfully kept by their prophets and wise men, Which was buried in the earth. This record had been brought forth and translated and published and the missionaries had brought some copies of the book, one of which he wished to present to the great chief. The chief replied that they would build a house and have the missionaries come and read the book to them. The missionaries spent several days with the people and considerable excitement prevailed when the news reached the frontier settlements in Missouri. The jealousy and envy of the Indian agents and sectarian missionaries were excited to such a degree that the missionaries were ordered out of the Indian country as disturbers of the peace and even threatened with military action in case of noncompliance. They left the Indian country and commenced laboring in Jackson County, Missouri, among the whites. Here they made several converts who were baptized and added to the Church. Thus ended the first Indian mission, in which the brethren had preached the gospel in its fulness and distributed the record of their forefathers among three tribes: the Catteraugus Indians, near Buffalo, New York, the Wyandots, of Ohio, and the Delawares, west of Missouri. The Prophet Joseph Smith later met with delegations of Sac and Fox and Potawatomi tribes, but there is very little recorded of these labors. During the troublesome times that the Church Went through, including the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother. Patriarch Hyrum Smith, there was not much work among the Indians. However, President Brigham Young established friendship among the Indians by his policy "that it was better to feed the Indians than to fight them." Courtesy John Galbraith In 1854, Jacob Hamblin, with Ira Hatch, Samuel Knight, Thales Haskell and A. P. Hardy, were called to go to Santa Clara and there open a ' mission among the Indians. This mission reached into Arizona among the Moquis, Pimas and Navajos. No more thrilling tales of adventure can be found than in the life of Jacob Hamblin among the Indians. His honesty, fairness and friendly treatment of the Lamanites made them feel that he was their great friend. Jacob Hamblin spent most of his time from 1854 to 1877 in helping the Indians to a better life. AT the April Conference in 1855, forty-one missionaries, under the direction of Alfred N. Billings, were called by President Young to establish a mission among the Ute Indians, who resided in the vicinity of Elk Mountain, near Moab, Grand County, Utah. It is recorded that they were accompanied by Arrapeen, a converted ehief. The company consisted of forty-one men, fifteen wagons, sixty-five cows, thirteen horses, two bulls, one calf, two pigs, four dogs, twelve chickens and a splendid supply of provisions. Upon their arrival at their destination, they found about ten acres of land planted in corn, melons, squash and pumpkins. The seed had been secured by the Indians from an exploring party under the direction of W. D. Huntington, who had visited with the   Indians the year before. It had been planted in Indian fashion and the yield was fairly good considering the preparation of the soil. These missionaries built a fort, then started to clear the land for planting, and sought a location for a dam, which they knew they must have to bring water on the land. Soon they met St. John, Chief of the Elk Mountain Indians. The missionaries tried to show and teach the Indians the white man's way of working and living, as well as interesting them in the principles of the gospel. It was not long before the friendly Indians applied for baptism and on the 23rd* of July, fourteen men and women were baptized. Through the good work of Arrapeen, the neighboring Navajos visited the fort and asked to make peace with the Utes. As time went on more Indians were baptized and the brethren thought that all was going to be well with them. But as the crops began to mature, the Indians destroyed the potatoes and gardens of the pioneers. Then they started to steal the cattle belonging to the mission. The elders decided to change the location of the herd grounds so they could more carefully watch their animals. This angered the Indians and a skirmish followed, in which one of the Indians was killed. Chief St. John was their friend, but his son Charles led in the depredations and he and his followers threatened to kill every white settler. So the missionaries decided to return to Manti. Some of the friendly Indians accompanied them part way and expressed their desire for the white missionaries to live among them. Also in 1855, a site having been selected in the upper valley of the MISSIONS TO THE INDIANS 455 Salmon River Basin (now in Idaho) among the Bannock and Shoshone Indians, a company of twenty brethren, mostly from Salt Lake County, Utah, was organized with Thomas S. Smith as president. Traveling to Bear River, they continued through Malad Valley to Snake River until they reached the Salmon River Pass. On the 14th of June they selected a site on what is now known as Lemhi River. They immediately commenced to make improvements and soon had a blacksmith shop in working order, burned coal, and built a corral for the stock. Soon they had built seven houses besides breaking and planting several acres of land and doing considerable fencing. They called their location Fort Lemhi, in honor of Limhi, a Nephite king mentioned in the Book of Mormon. Assisted by the Indians, the settlement proved a success and the Indians, who were anxious to learn the white man's ways of agriculture, were assisted by the brethren. The families of the first settlers and others from Utah soon arrived. President Brig-ham Young visited the settlement in 1857. A second fort was built that year, north of the original fort, and a considerable amount of grain and vegetables was raised. In February 1858, while several of the brethren were busily engaged in mowing hay and hauling timber, a large party of Bannock and Shoshone Indians, many of whom lived around the fort and had previously been very friendly, made a sudden break upon the herd of the settlers, drove off most of the stock belonging to the fort, killed George McBride and James Miller and wounded President Thomas S. Smith and other brethren. This uprising of the Indians led to the abandonment of Fort Lemhi by Latter-day Saints later in 1858, the settlers returning to Utah. On the journey, Bailey Lake, one of the party, was killed by Indians on Bannock Creek. It is believed that this sudden Indian outbreak was caused by the fact that United States soldiers, under General Albert S. Johnston, were encamped near Fort Bridger in the winter of 1857-1858, engaged in a punitive expedition against the people of Utah, who were falsely charged with disloyalty to the United States. Misinformed in regard to this matter, the soldiers are said to have influenced the Indians to make trouble. Space will not permit of an article giving full details of the very great work accomplished among the Indians by the Church. Suffice it to mention that missionaries were sent among the Poncas in Nebraska and South Dakota, the Pueblo Indians in New Mexico, the Mohaves in Nevada and California, the Maricopas and Papagos in Arizona, the Zunis in Arizona and New Mexico, the Creeks in the Indian Territory, and the Utes and Shoshones in Utah and Idaho. TWO incidents are worthy of mention, showing the power of God that accompanied the missionaries in their labors. In 1857, Ira Hatch and Dudley Leavitt were among the Mohaves. These Indians showed a great dislike and distrust of the missionaries and planned their destruction. However, the humble prayers of these two brethren changed the Indians' attitude of hate to one of love and the missionaries did much good among that tribe. In 1878, Brother Llewellyn Harris was laboring among the Zunis. Smallpox broke out among the Indians, causing many deaths. Brother Harris administered to a very sick boy, who was healed. The Indians made known to Brother Harris their desire that he administer to all of their sick. He commenced to do this but found he could not reach them all so the sick were brought to a large house where Brother Harris administered to more than four hundred Indians. Through the mercy and blessings of God, following these administrations, most of the sick were made well. Successful wards of Indians have been established at Washakie, Utah, Indianola, Utah, and Papa-go, Arizona. Through the patient and loving help given by kind, good and faithful men and women, such as Bishop Hicks and his wife at Papago, the Indians have been made to realize the great blessings that the gospel has brought to them. May the day speedily come when more of these Lamanites may be brought to see the gospel truths and become as they once were "a white and delightsome people." Indian membership of the Church in 1945 is estimated from 1,500 to 2,000.
