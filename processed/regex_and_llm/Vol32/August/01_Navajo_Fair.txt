NAVAJO FAIR Anna Prince Redd Down from tepees, timber cool, they come To sell their silver bracelets at the fair, To barter concha belts and turquoise rings For white man's sugar, flour, and calico. For red and orange dyes to tint new wool. They come from far, "Dineh,  the People, come, With rattle of gourd and tom-tom's steady pulse. Their blankets splotching color on the sand Like gaudy cactus full in thorny bloom Against the gray of cliff and blue of sky. And as they come they chant and sing, or dance The Harvest Dance. A lean, straight race of men With amber squaws whose velvet laughter falls To soothe the brown papooses in their shawls. The Cover "Desert Abode" from a photograph by Willard Luce.
