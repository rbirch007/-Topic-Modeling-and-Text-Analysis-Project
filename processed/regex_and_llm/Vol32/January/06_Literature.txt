CHRISTIE LUND COLES Second Prize Poem Aftermath Christie Lund Coles I Today I walked with autumn on a hill And all the autumns of our past came back; All the wide acres of my heart grew still As swallows traced the sky in seamless track; My heart was heavy with its aching loss, The honk of wild geese left me as forlorn And desolate as barren trees, across The far horizon where the mist is born. Today I walked with autumn and with this  An hour of stark and timeless quietude; I knew all I could bear of loneliness, I faced infinities of solitude. For memories too, leave but a seamless track. Since loneliness nor tears can bring you back! PRIZE-WINNING POEMS II I remember a day of autumn weather  The heft of the wind and the slant of sun, The edge of cold when winter was at its tether, The scent of trampled leaves as the year was done; And while I walk alone in these same places, I think of you, the wall of slivered rain, The brook-cool air upon our lifted faces. The words we whispered that were said in vain. I know a sudden, dark, recurrent yearning, Remembering that opalescent dusk Lying on valleys where the season, turning, Was marked by jeweled sun on the corn's dry husk; Still I am sure as leaves in autumn weather That in the wind of death we'll be together. Il Sleep, beloved, here where the grass is fluted By the wind on this green and lonely hill. Sleep and be glad that your anguish is muted. Sleep undisturbed by the world at its kill; Now I must stand here alone, bereft, seeing The town where we walked alive and unaware That death could part us, sorrow eat at our being, Betray us, track us down like a beast to its lair. Soon I will go back into the city, Back to the clamor and passions of men, I will not expect nor find any pity, Uncomforted, I will lie awake again With loneliness beyond the name of grief-Yet spring returns.. And life.. And budding leaf. This is the second time Christie Lund Coles has been an award winner in the Eliza R. Snow Poem Contest having received first prize in last year's contest.

CAROLINE EYRING MINER THIRD PRIZE POEM That Which Sustains Caroline Eyring Miner Yesterday They knew, who walked the trackless desert miles, Who breathed the dust the oxen powdered fine And forded rivers, trying to divine The way where savage, beast, would not discern Their presence. They who walked in endless files And halted but to dig their graves no sign To mark the spot  they knew the great design Could not be stayed nor curbed by man's concern, They knew they were the instruments of God And these were moments of eternity. The thought sustained them as they slowly trod Their way. This was for their posterity. Because their purpose was divine, complete, Their weariness, their sacrifice, was sweet. Today Within this quiet church they surely know. The warm light filters through the colored glass And gold and silver merge as minutes pass And sunlight touches young and older heads Bent reverently. The flowers in the low White bowl are gay and bright, a lovely mass Of bloom. No harmony can ever surpass This scene of perfect peace. And as he reads, 'The Lord is verily our own good shepherd/' The speaker knows that all assembled feel Secure, despite the warring world, the Lord Who led them here, will to their sons reveal His power in their extremest need. To be So certain is to glimpse eternity. Tomorrow I know that though the sun goes down today. Tomorrow it will rise again; the flower. Remembered perfume, colored dust, an hour From now, in God's own time, will bloom again. These things I know for I have seen. They say I only have the vision of this earth, the power To know the clearly proven fact. The Tower Of Babel was confusion, for those men Sought heaven by building solid rock and stone. Is sweet content the fruit of. Other tree? The peace beyond our knowledge comes alone Through perfect trust and faith and will to see That God yet rules the troubled earth and through The sacrament of sorrow, he'll come to you.
