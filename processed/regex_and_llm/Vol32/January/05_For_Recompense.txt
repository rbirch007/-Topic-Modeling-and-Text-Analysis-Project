For Recompense Vesta Pierce Crawford What shall he find when sounds of cannon cease And after long wandering he returns To his own land, his dream deferred, and peace? And what shall comfort the heart that yearns To lose the memory of sacrifice, What valid solace shall his loved ones give To heal the lost look in a soldier's eyes. By what eternal measure shall he live? Give him the river's song, the shadowed hill, A road that leads to his familiar door, Make his mornings eager and his midnight still Page 6 PRIZE-WINNING POEMS And give to him the love he waited for; Give him this recompense, confirm his choice-Children's laughter home a woman's voice. 11 Metal that made the sword can shape a plow, The tool of promise, strength, security-Give a man the brighter blade, show him how To cleave the ground in furrowed symmetry, This is an ancient truth and long revealed, Dominion of the earth is sure defense, And by this touch a broken man is healed  In seed and soil he finds his recompense. For there is solace where the snow has lain And comfort when the fallow season turns To April's chalice and the sound of rain. Once more, like hopeful grass, the seared heart learns That tenure of the earth alone can bring The jewelled sunlight to the field of spring. Ill In Sabbath twilight let the soldier find The open door, the edifice of prayer. Let all the battered ramparts of his mind Receive the sound of benediction there. Too vivid still he bears the lash of memory. And yet the sacred parables can light The wilderness of doubt that men may see A lambent star above the hills of night. Give him the quietness of sacrament. The Bible's treasured word and organ tone, The union of this brotherhood be sent For recompense that once he knelt alone; And let only luminous words be said In worship when the soldier bows his head.
