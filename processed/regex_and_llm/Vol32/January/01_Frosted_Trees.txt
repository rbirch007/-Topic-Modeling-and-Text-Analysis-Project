FROSTED TREES Grace M. Candland All trees in winter are a lovely sight When frost has settled round each limb and branch, As if some elfin artist would enhance Our joy, and make the somber day more bright. These jeweled pencils pointing to the sky Or fragile rods of pure white peppermint Are bits of glory without measured stint To tempt the notice of each passerby. The bitter winds and heaps of ice and snow Reveal a magic beauty all their own, And from their ample frigid arms we know The grand array of springtime buds are blown. Life, too, must have its cold and darksome day And yield its treasure as it slips away. The Cover: The cover "Winter in City Creek Canyon, Salt Lake City, Utah" is from a photograph by Grace O.

SPAFFORD AT the opening of a new year, we are generally more inclined than at any other time to try to visualize what lies immediately ahead. We wonder what the new year will bring. It is a time also when we are most inclined to make new resolutions, and new plans, taking into account the mistakes and failures of the past and focusing our attention on our highest and most cherished ideals. And now what of this new year? What will it bring? With war raging all around the globe, impoverishing the whole earth, and inflicting on civilization the severest blows which it has ever received, with sorrow and tragedy entering home after home, the future seems discouraging and unpredictable. We therefore face the new year with sad hearts and with our minds disturbed and perplexed and filled with anxiety, apprehension, and uncertainty. It is obvious that our first duty, and that which lies closest at hand, is to do what is humanly possible to comfort those who are sad and bereft and, through earnest and sober prayer, ask our Heavenly Father to bless them and to give us all divine guidance through this period of peril. Let us, however, not lose hope, let us not lose faith. Let us cling to the thought that the thousands, yes millions, of peace-loving, righteous, Godfearing people in the world can, through faith and works and prayers, help to bring about what one philosopher has called "the rule of intelligence, of morals and of law." Let us remember what the Lord said toAbra-ham regarding the righteous as a protection to the wicked. In Genesis 18:26 we read, "And the Lord said. If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes." He later declared that he would save the city if only ten righteous could be found. Let us have faith and keep in mind the words of Jesus to his disciples: "And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour. Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said. Why could not we cast him out? And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain. Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you" (Matt. 17:18-20). What the world most needs today is the acceptance and application of the laws of God as these are set forth in the Decalogue, and amplified by the Savior in the Sermon on the Mount. When the children of Israel strayed away from the teachings of their Maker, when they set up and worshipped an idol in the form of a golden calf, through Moses they were given the Ten Commandments written by God with his own hand on tablets of stone. When Christ came to redeem Israel and the world, he restated, emphasized, and amplified the teachings of Sinai. These laws and teachings are fundamental and eternal. And now, today, when so many people have departed from or set aside the laws and teachings of God and, in their place, have set up new man-made philosophies which have brought upon mankind many great and mighty evils the like of which the world has never known before, it is time for us to struggle, as best we can, to apply these fundamental teachings which have been a guide through the ages, and to awaken in the hearts of all people such an interest in the things of God that they will make an effort to live righteous lives and thus help to bring peace and freedom to all mankind.
