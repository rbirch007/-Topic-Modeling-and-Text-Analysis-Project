Special Problems in Housekeeping Claire P. Dorious Oh wad some power the giftie gie us to see oursels as others see us!?Robert Burns Spots and Stains. One important wartime job is to take care of what we have. A spot or stain spoils the appearance of any fabric. Commercial laundries and dry cleaners are not always available. The wise homemaker learns to care for the family's clothing and all household fabrics herself. Fresh spots are removed more easily than old ones. It is always better to remove spots and stains before washing or cleaning the entire garment. Knowing the nature of the spot simplifies the job. Two precautions should be kept in mind: first, not to destroy the surface or finish of the material, and second, not to rub so hard that any of the dye is removed from colored fabrics. If possible, it is always safer to experiment with a small sample of the fabric. Stain Removers. Stain removers may be divided into absorbents, solvents, and bleaches. Absorbents are used mainly for the removal of grease spots. Fresh chalk, talcum powder, Fuller's earth, dry starch, cornmeal, and dry cleaning powders are absorbents. In using absorbents, spread the stained fabric on a flat surface. Cover grease spot thickly with absorbent. This may be worked around gently with the fingers. Sometimes it is necessary to leave the absorbent on the spot for several hours. It is then brushed carefully. Repeat if necessary. Grease spots are sometimes removed by placing the fabric between, two sheets of white blotting paper and pressing the spot with a warm iron. Several thicknesses of paper towels serve the same purpose. These treatments are effective for fresh stains on white or light colored fabrics. It is almost impossible to brush all traces of an absorbent from dark materials. Solvents. Solvents are used to dissolve a stain. Cleaning fluids, alcohol (denatured or wood), ammonium hydroxide, ether, carbon tetrachloride, or commercial solvents with this base may be used when water fails. When using solvents, lay the material, spot side down, on a pad of cloth or white blotting paper, apply the solvent with a soft cloth rubbing from the edge toward the center of the spot. Change the pad occasionally and also change the sponging cloth as soon as it is soiled. Caution: Most all cleaning fluids are inflammable. Be careful to use them in small quantities, work in well ventilated room, and keep stopper in bottle while working. Bleaches are used in the last attempt to remove a stain. They should be applied very carefully. Javelle water, oxalic acid, potassium permanganate, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hydro-sulphite are usually more successful for bleaching purposes than lemon juice or sour milk. Bleaches will injure fabrics unless directions are followed carefully. Method to use?Stretch the stained portion of the material over the top Page  of a bowl 1/2 to 1/4 full of hot water and fasten tightly with a rubber band, then apply the remover with a medicine dropper. Be sure to rinse out all bleaching fluid with clear water after the stain has been removed. Apply the water very carefully. Clorox, a commonly known bleach, may be used to remove some stains if directions on the bottle are followed carefully. Fruit stains are removed by stretching the fabric over a bowl and pouring hot water from a height through the spot. Miscellaneous Stains: Iron Rust-Lemon juice and salt or oxalic acid made into a concentrated solution are effective. Any good commercial iron rust remover is good for white cotton or linen. Do not use for silk or colored materials. Ink?Apply stain remover with medicine dropper. A small amount of ammonia, added to hydrogen peroxide is helpful. Two tablespoonfuls of ammonia added to the hot water will produce fumes that are often effective. Heavy Grease?Rub a small amount of clean, unsalted fat on the spot and work it around with the fingers. Wash in warm water and heavy suds. Turpentine is a well-known solvent for fresh paint to use on the hands, wood or glass. Household Pests. Most pests are remarkably adaptable. They will climb high or low in search of food. Houseflies are the most common and the most dangerous of all household pests. They may be carriers of such diseases as typhoid, tuberculosis, cholera, diarrhea and dysentery. The housefly lays it eggs in decayed animal or vegetable matter. Hence, absolute cleanliness both inside and out is necessary for its extermination. All windows and doors should be well screened. Ants are not actually harmful but their persistence is annoying. Sodium fluoride powder (poisonous), is quite effective, but keep it away from children and pets. Some sprays are also helpful. Mice. To avoid mice, guard against their entrance, by closing up all holes and cracks. The wooden snap trap is the best mouse exterminator. Cheese is not as popular with mice as freshly fried bacon, oil sardines, or peanut butter. Moths. A preliminary cleanout will da much to prevent moths. A good spray or some moth preventive should be used before storing. Store in moth-proof bags or closets or cedar chests. Cockroaches feed mainly on dead animal matter and cereals. Try to obtain expert advice. A mixture of equal parts of fresh pyrethrum and sodium fluoride is very effective. Bedbugs are no respecter of persons. Powders and sprays are effective if introduced into the places where the bugs are hidden. Mosquitoes like houseflies are carriers of disease. Their extermination should become a community project. Elimination of all breeding places is necessary. Expert advice may be obtained from a county agent or the state board of health. House rats carry disease. They are destructive and are filthy in their habits. Cutting off the rat's food and water supply is the surest way of {Continued on page 64) LESSON DEPARTMENT
