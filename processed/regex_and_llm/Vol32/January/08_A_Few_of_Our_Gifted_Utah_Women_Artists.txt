A Few of Our Gifted Utah Women Artists Alice Merrill Home Former Member of Relief Society General Board Part II While Dr. Heber John Richards was visiting and traveling in art centers of Europe with his wife and daughters, Hattie married, in the city of Paris, J. T. Harwood, her former art teacher in Utah. The young couple spent their honeymoon at Pont Aven a French fishing port where they both painted. Hattie Harwood's still life "Pumpkin" won a name for the young artist in a day, when it was accepted and hung in the beautiful Woman's Building of the Columbian Exposition at Chicago. Hattie was a painter of flowers, too. Her still life was distinguished. Hattie's father and her grandfather, Dr. Willard Richards, who was first editor of the Deseret News, were both college men of high attainments. Hattie, too, possessed a legal mind. She read her father's scientific works, took extension courses in research, and such studies as geology and astronomy at the University of Utah. Hattie's mother, Julia Johnson, was a daughter of Ellis Johnson, biologist and horticulturist of Southern Utah in pioneer days. Both mother and daughter had the gift to propagate rare house plants. The Harwoods went to California in search of greater art opportunities. The young mother, stricken with a toxic goiter, was forced to lie in bed. From books brought her from the public libraries, before her death, she went, in imagination, with the North and South Polar Expeditions. Ruth Har-wood, poet and illustrator, is their daughter. Harwood painted several lovely portraits of his beautiful wife. A school collection should be named for her and contain some of her own work, and also some of Harwood's portraits of this gifted woman.  Hattie Richards Harwood PETUNIAS AT WINDOW UTAH WOMEN ARTISTS Rachel Grant Taylor THE HOME OF YESTERYEAR Rachel Grant Taylor   In Rachel Grant Taylor's recent water colors is seen a rich flowering of a gift to paint. The Heber City Central School has named its collection for Rachel Grant Taylor. The school children purchased Rachel's "Blossoming Trees" and the artist presented "Yesteryear's Barn." The Alice Merrill Home gift was Rachel's "Pleasant Valley Hill Foliage." This painting of charm reveals oak brush which is almost moving. The whole landscape seems diffused with a soft light reminiscent of the end of day. Also there is a feeling of the last day of summer. This painting, purchased for a gift painting to honor Bathsheba W. Smith, pioneer artist, is a part of Mrs. Taylor's collection. Rachel's love for art is not stronger than her husband's, for John H. Taylor, though modest of his prowess, is an art collector in his own right and cherishes his art collection. Ruth Ballard Snow   a Utah artist who resides at Arlington, Va., is winning for herself a place among contemporary American artists. Mrs. Snow holds membership in the Society of Washington Artists, and Virginia Art League. Her work has been exhibited at the Philips Memorial Gallery and with the Society of Washington Etchers, Carnegie Library. Recently, at the Seventeenth Biennial Exhibition in the Corcoran Gallery of Art, she won honorable mention. She is an art instructor at Corcoran Art School, being assistant to Nickolai Cicousky, the noted figure painter. Formerly in Utah as head of Granite High art department, her work was more or less profound. Ruth married Dale C. Snow and went to Washington where her husband was employed with the Government.  Ruth Ballard Snow PORTRAIT OF MY MOTHER Opportunities came fast from the day she entered Corcoran School to continue her art studies. The work of this artist has found ready sale in Utah when she exhibits with the Utah Art Colony of which she is a cherished member. In the East, sales follow her exhibitions. Mrs. Snow's father, the late Melvin J. Ballard, has been recognized for his eloquence as a preacher and he could have made a place for himself in the concert hall with his fine baritone voice. Like her father, Mary Ruth, as she is often called, possesses a fine presence, is a good speaker and wins friends by her charming personality. Her mother has the gift of design. The writer, with President Emmeline B. Wells, visited the Ballard home in Portland as guests of the Northwestern Mission. Mrs. Ballard's home management, her hospitality, her entertainment of guests, and the work of her hands shown in clothing her children and decorating the home, revealed an artistic temperament which carried over to Mary Ruth. Grace Cutler Solomon, granddaughter of the late John C. Cutler, has gifts in her own right. A water colorist of varied attainments, she writes verse and paints pictures as did her poet uncle, Alfred Lambourne. This young artist's Winter Exhibition contained a subtle "Winter Fields" as well as "House of Memories," which bravely depicted a quaint pioneer home  both water colors were snatched up by a private collector. Grace C. Solomon GARDEN FLOWERS UTAH WOMEN ARTISTS 19 -Ida May Savage ANCIENT POTTERY Mrs. Solomon is often represented by a design which is fancifully created from one flower. Several collections have chosen her design from a magnolia or some other favorite flower. This ambitious artist is able to maintain a beautiful home and family life with her gifted husband, C. Francis Solomon. Recently she, with her daughter, was in Chicago, brushing up at the Chicago Art Institute. Ida May Savage was blue-eyed, fair, a true blonde, with a charming personality. She was a promising student of Harwood and painted flowers with flower quality. There was grace and charm in her compositions and she painted only clean color. Daughter of Charles R. Savage who made a circle of love for art around him, Ida died too young, and to keep her memory green the lovely creations of her hand could well be brought together to establish a school collection with her dear name attached thereto. Mary Teasdel   a much traveled person, was a graduate of the University of Utah. She studied piano, voice, and an extended art course under J. T. Harwood and continued in Paris for three years. On her return home, Miss Teasdel was elected third president of the Utah Art Institute when, with the help of Cyrus E. Dallin, her close friend, the New York and Boston artists sent outstanding canvases to the annual exhibition held at the old Social Hall. Mary took her mother with her for a second trip to Europe. Miss Teasdel was a brilliant conversationalist and correspondent. Perhaps no other art teacher was more inspiring than Mary. She possessed a remarkable vocabulary and her knowledge of art was broad. The writer has heard her criticisms in class lectures illustrating a certain problem in art. She would say, "Velasquez the Spanish painter would render the problem this way; Rembrandt used this method; Rubens treated it like this; and James McNeill Whistler (who was her main inspiration) would have this version."  Mary Teasdel BLOSSOMS Any art student would be fortunate to be under Mary Teasdel's wing. J. T. Harwood, her teacher, had the first painting from Utah hung in the Salon. Mary Teas-del was next to be hung in the Spring Salon. She had the honor of having three miniatures chosen for the French Exposition in 1900. Two of her portraits are in the State Alice Art Collection which received the $300 prize. She had the gift to achieve simplicity in her work, for in her fine use of colors as well as in the painting of rich fabrics, she accomplished perhaps the greatest quality of art  repose. Thirty-two of Mary Teasdel's paintings hang in a memorial collection as a civic collection at the Smithfield Carnegie Public Library. HILMA Mole Payne   One of Utah's virile artists and named among the 500 American artists   paints with enthusiasm Utah's blue skies, the Weber River, cottonwood trees, blossoming orchards, spring, and reflections in both pond and running brook. Hilma Mole studied with Harwood at the University of Utah. A trip abroad visiting the galleries of both the Old World and the United States did much for this ambitious artist. Hilma begins right by first creating a design for her pictures. She is a colorist and knows her tools well; and so produces works of art. Coupled with the ability to work, Hilma has the necessary qualifications to make what we call a "born artist." She is also a financier. Last fall when the pickers failed to appear at the Payne orchard, she gathered 400 bushels of apples and sold them, too. The Wasatch High School Hilma Mole Payne Art Collection in Heber City is among the best of Utah's thirty public school collections. In addition, her work is hung in many other picture galleries and private collections in the State. A. J. Payne, her husband, and James, the son, are proud of the accomplishments of this woman who is winning a name for herself in the Utah Art Colony exhibitions. Mr. Payne, a native of Tennessee, once kept the missionaries from being mobbed, and then made friends with the mobbers who joined his Sunday School class.
