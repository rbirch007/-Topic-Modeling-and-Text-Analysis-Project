THE FLEXIBLE HOUSE Adeline J. Haws To Marie and Leonard Tanner The flexible house on a corner stands And the back door faces the street. It's easy as easy to get inside With loads of good things to eat. Although it was built for only two. It more oft has ten or more, Sleeping somewhere between its walls? On bed, on couch or floor. Nobody ever saw it bulge? It was never known to shrink? But to hold all the folk it holds sometimes It must have stretched, I think. The table is short or the table is long According to who is there; But food never enters hungry lips Without a 'Thank You" prayer. Oh, the flexible house could tell some tales Of happy hours, I ween. If it could talk and tell the things That it has heard and seen. There's a parlor with plenty of room for fun. And windows that open in, A mantle with pictures, a fireplace, A kitchen with stove and bin. Yes, the flexible house is a happy house Because it is a part Of the folk who made it the Flexible House In the bigness of their heart.
