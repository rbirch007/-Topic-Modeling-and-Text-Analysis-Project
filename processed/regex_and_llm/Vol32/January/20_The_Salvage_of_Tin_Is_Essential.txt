The Salvage of Tin Is Essential Tin, used in small proportions and almost exclusively in combination with other strategic metals, is a concealed war weapon, and a deadly one. It goes into every war machine, on land, sea, or in the air. A battleship contains 76 tons of tin. The intricate machinery of a submarine calls for more than 3 tons of tin. A destroyer must have 490 pounds of tin for its electrical system alone. Every heavy bomber must have 48 pounds of tin, every medium tank 35 pounds, every Diesel engine 13 pounds. Airplane motors, cannon, machine guns, bomb sights, gas masks, torpedoes, and hand grenades, radio, telephone, and telegraph equipment?all demand tin. Tin, known among the ancients as the "devil of the metals," because of its unique effect on the physical properties of other metals when combined with them, is the hidden but irreplaceable component in the alloys that go into war equipment and in the solders that hold many of the parts together.. Also for medical items tin is indispensable. The fighting man's individual morphine hypodermic syringe (syrette), his emergency sulfa ointments, blood plasma, and other medicaments are kept free from contamination in containers of pure tin or tin-coated steel. All these urgent military needs as well as essential civilian demands for tin must be met out of a diminishing supply of this metal.. Though this country has long been the world's largest consumer of tin, it has produced practically none, for workable tin deposits are almost nonexistent in the United States?or anywhere else in North America. Ever since the beginning of the war, the United States has been learning to do without tin for all but the most essential uses. Tin coated containers may be used only for those products which must be packed in tin. The use of tin has been banned for kitchen utensils, galvanized ware, toys, costume jewelry, Christmas tree ornaments, and many other items. Tin foil is permitted to be used for electrotype machines, electrical condenser, and a few other essential purposes, but none can be made available to wrap such items as tobacco, chocolate or cheese for civilians... An important factor in filling the gap is the salvaging of tin from tin cans. Billions of cans, each containing 1 per cent pure tin by weight, go into American homes each year. They are the most dependable source of tin in the Nation today... Since the launching of the tin can salvage program in the spring of 1942, collections have grown from 1,000 tons a month to 20,000 tons, or approximately 200,000,000 cans, at the present time. But the country's 8 detinning and 6 shredding plants are able to handle tin cans at twice the current rate. Two out of three tin cans going into homes are still being lost in garbage piles?a loss that the United States can ill afford.-War Board Salvage Your Tin! Page 48
