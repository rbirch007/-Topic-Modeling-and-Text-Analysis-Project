Social Science Modern Applications of Ethical Principles Lesson 6?Honesty, the Core of Character Dr. Harold T. Christensen For Tuesday, April 24, 1945 Lesson link: The discussion last time centered around truth and its perversions. It was shown that truth is the very framework of ethics, but that because of abuses; such as ignorance, lying, cheating, hypocrisy, expediency, et cetera, the highest morality is frequently never reached. Lesson aim: To analyze the ethical aspects of character and to show that honesty is at the heart or core of it all. THE last hundred years or so has " been described as the age of science. During this period, more than at any other time, man has been occupied with the discovery and analysis of facts. And in this quest for factual truth man has been largely successful, for he has greatly extended the boundaries of his understanding, making possible, thereby, a speedier progression and a higher morality. But facts alone are not enough. In spite of the world's technological advancement, it is doubtful that it is any more happy or any more moral than before, as we have shown in an earlier lesson. Knowledge means power; but power used without principle is a curse rather than a blessing. The misapplication of facts is as often to blame for the ills of man as is the ignorance of facts. Science cannot substitute for virtue. The right application of knowledge and the right use of power are far more important than knowledge and power in and of themselves. Technical education without adequate ethical orientation is of questionable value. It is time for man to realize that character building is the most important business of life. Character Versus Reputation It was shown last month that truth is frequently abused and distorted in an attempt at self-benefit. The highest morality depends upon our ability to strive for: Truth instead of falsehood Intelligence rather than ignorance Information in place of confirmation Straight thinking in place of fantasy Sincerity in place of indifference Certainty along with sincerity Intellectual honesty instead of self-justification. Analytic searching rather than dogmatic defending Conviction in place of skepticism Confidence without arrogance or self-pity Self-interest without cheating Humility without self-depreciation Statesmanship rather than politics Honor rather than expediency Genuineness rather than hypocrisy Principle rather than profit Whenever truth becomes neglected or perverted in any of the ways discussed (or any other way for that matter) morality suffers. Dishonesty is the willful abuse of truth, whether it be on the covert, the verbal, or the overt plane. Some people are dishonest because they won't think straight, others because they lie, and still others because they cheat. But most dishonest individuals offend on all three of these levels covering up deceit with more deceit. Because of this all-too-common tendency to cover up or hide the real self from others, there is frequently a fundamental difference between a person's character and his reputation. Character is what we are, while reputation is what we seem to be to others. If everyone was entirely honest, character and reputation would be identical; but since all are not honest, man is easily fooled and injustice is perpetuated. A Sunday School teacher assigned the twenty-fifth chapter of St. Luke to be read for the following week. When the class reassembled he asked how many had read the assignment, and about one-third of the hands went up. "Well," he remarked to the startled group, "you are just the ones I want to talk to for my subject is on lying, and there isn't any twenty-fifth chapter in St. Luke." Several years ago Eddie Cantor offered a $5,000 prize to high school students for the best essay on peace. Out of the thousands of entries a young man was selected and taken to New York City to be honored and awarded the prize. But before the end, it was discovered that he had copied a large proportion of his essay word for word from a magazine article published a few years earlier. Needless to say, he went home in disgrace and without the prize, all because he had failed to understand the meaning of plagiarism. These are only two of many examples that could be given to illustrate the existence of basic dishonesty in society around us. Studies reveal that quite a high percentage of our young people copy and cheat in school. But the problem doesn't stop there. Even a cursory self-analysis along with an examination of society at large will reveal that cheating is not confined to school nor to the young alone.
Those who seek to build or protect their reputation by deceit will do well to remember that, "nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest, neither any thing hid that shall not be known and come abroad" (Luke 8:17).
The Role of Honesty in Character
Hugh M. Woodward (Humanity's Greatest Need, pp. 137-150) following an arrangement by Mrs. Noenetta Richardson, summarizes the major qualities of character by comparing them to the construction elements of a building. The aim or motivation for building the temple of character is found through self
unfoldment and service to humanity. The temple is located on the mount of service beside life's highway. The great sustaining pillars which support the entire structure are self-respect, self-effort, self-control, and self-poise. The foundations of the temple are honesty, trustworthiness, sincerity, and courage. The floor is made up of perseverance, temperance, frankness, and humility. The doors for entrance into the temple are faith, a passion for the truth, an interest in all life, constant industry and effort, and a wakeful conscience. The windows of the temple, which represent the attitude of a righteous soul, are a genuine interest in life, a sympathetic understanding of others, tolerance, and love. The color scheme is cheerfulness blended with refinement, kindliness, gentleness, and gratitude. The crowning feature of this temple of character is made up of charitableness and altruistic service.
Some of these features of character we have already discussed in earlier lessons, and others will be examined on later dates. While the scheme obviously is not perfect as it stands, it is at least suggestive. With close study, it may seem desirable to add additional qualities of character and mentioned here or to rearrange the order and relative position of those given. But, perfect or not, such a scheme should at least prove helpful in any character analysis.
To the writer the most significant thing about this temple of character is the including of honesty in the foundation. It would be impossible to even conceive of character without honesty, for any structure founded on deceit and falsehood is founded upon sand and rather than rock and must inevitably fall. Furthermore, a careful scrutiny of the other factors of character listed here will reveal that they are all related to basic honesty. Honesty, then, may be considered as the core of character. Character Building The roots of character reach back into infancy and early childhood. Character building starts soon after birth and continues throughout life, as the individual learns and absorbs the moral codes of those about him. But the first impressions are the most important, for they arrive when the personality is most pliable, and they set the stage or determine the focus for later ones. As the twig is bent the tree is inclined. Parents sometimes fail to realize the tremendous responsibility that is theirs in shaping the characters of their developing children. Aside from their frequent neglect of moral instruction in the home, impression and example are often of the wrong sort. It is likely that we teach more by what we are than by what we say, and for this reason many children go wrong. Righteousness is contagious, but, unfortunately, so also is unrighteousness; and too many parents are in the second class. Sometimes children are woefully neglected, sometimes they are bossed and shoved around in the spirit of ownership without any training in responsibility and self-control, and sometimes they are actually encouraged by their parents to lie or cheat or in other ways be dishonest and unsocial. Children are a blessing, a gift of the highest order. But with every gift comes a responsibility, and, unfortunately, there are many modern parents who fail to realize this. Irresponsible parenthood is back of most of the immorality of the day. While the home is the first and the most primary nursery of character, it does not stand alone. The church, the school, and other groups or persons that the individual contacts and from which he absorbs culture are also involved. Morals do not come ready-made, and the making of morals is the responsibility of us all. Character building requires instruction and example of the right kind; respect for individuality and personality; opportunity for responsibility and self-control; and all of this from parents, teachers, and associates who come in daily contact with the young. Whether our children develop into immoral expedients or honorable characters depends, in a large measure, upon us. Adult ethics (or lack of ethics) and juvenile delinquency are intrinsically related. "God Give Us Men" Abraham Lincoln represented the type of manhood so much needed today when he said, "I am not bound to win, but I am bound to be true; I am not bound to succeed, but I am bound to live up to what light I have. I must stand with anybody that stands right; stand with him while he is right and part with him when he goes wrong." It is this type of resolution and courageous honesty that forms the core of character. Too many people in the modern world lack the strength that comes from honor, for LESSON DEPARTMENT 63 they have no honor; too many are Machiavellian, living for profit rather than principle. There must be no compromise with right and truth. What we need today is men and women who know the right and who have the honesty and the courage to live it, even when others aren't looking; men and women of fidelity, integrity, and honor. In conclusion let us say with J. G. Holland: God give us men! A time like this demands Strong minds, great hearts, true faith, and ready hands; Men whom the lust of office does not kill; Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy; Men who possess opinions and a will; Men who have honor; men who will not lie; Men who can stand before a demagogue And damn his treacherous flatteries without winking; Tall men, sun-crowned, who live above the fog In public duty and in private thinking; For while the rabble with their thumb-worn creeds. Their large professions and their little deeds Mingle in selfish strife, lo! Freedom weeps. Wrong rules the land, and waiting Justice sleeps. Problems for Thought and Action 1. Defend the statement that character building is the most important business of life. Have we departed from character emphasis in this age of science? Discuss pro and con. Why is factual knowledge alone insufficient for righteousness. 2. What is the difference between character and reputation? Why is there so often a difference between the two? What are the three levels of dishonesty? Give illustrations of dishonesty on each level. Why is a dishonest person so often dishonest on all three levels? Discuss. Is anyone one hundred per cent honest? Discuss. 3. Here is an actual case that might be used for debate or lively discussion: A young man in returning home from a party about three o'clock in the morning accidently awakened his mother, who then asked him the time of the night. He answered, "Plenty after twelve" but said it in such a way as to make it sound like "twenty after twelve." Technically he told the truth; but actually, by intention, he gave the wrong impression. The question is, was he lying? Think of other examples of "technical honesty" and decide whether the question of honesty is to be judged on the basis of words or intended meanings. 4. Name the major elements in the temple of character outlined in the lesson. If you have a blackboard available it might be well to try your hand at drawing the temple and labeling ' the various parts. Discuss the entire scheme and see if there are any suggestions for adding other elements or rearranging those listed. Show how honesty is central and basic in it all. Could the other qualities exist without honesty? 5. Why are the habits and attitudes learned in the early years of life so deeply engrained in the character complex? Why are parents so important in the process of character building? Name and discuss some of the mistakes parents make with reference to character training of their children. Discuss the places of the church and the school in character formation. 6. Read aloud and then analyze Holland's poem "God Give us Men." Find examples of honesty in the lives of Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, and other great men, and then show how their honesty has paid them dividends. In looking ahead to the next lesson show how the virtues of love, service, and tolerance would be largely negated without honesty as a starting point.
