Notes TO THE FIELD Auxiliary Regional Meetings and Monthly Union Meetings Authorized COPIES of the following letter "Further Instructions Regarding Conventions and Union Meetings" over the signature of the First Presidency of the Church were mailed to Relief Society stake presidents. It is reprinted herewith for the information of Relief Society officers: July 16, 1945 To Church Officers, Dear Brethren and Sisters: Further Instructions Regarding Conventions and Union Meetings Because of limitations set on automotive travel, the General Church Authorities on January 17, 1942, speaking through the First Presidency, advised General Boards of Auxiliary Organizations to discontinue the holding of monthly Union meetings, Institutes, and Conventions. Later, the Government itself placed a limitation upon assemblies throughout the entire country. The suspension of Unions and Conventions, of course, made less effective direct contact of Stake Boards as such with wards and branch officers and teachers, but placed greater responsibility upon the ward and branch organizations. We commend the local officers and teachers upon their willingness, ability, and increased effort to guide and instruct the members of their respective organizations during this Page 538 critical war-time period. It is gratifying, indeed, to note how efficiently the quorums and auxiliary organizations have functioned notwithstanding the limitations and difficulties under which they have had to labor. Occasional visits by General Board members to wards, stakes and districts requesting special help have contributed to increased efficiency in class work and in general spiritual uplift. A recent ruling by the Office of Price Administration, increasing the amount of gasoline for "A" coupons seems to point to such a relaxation with regard to the use of gasoline as will permit additional travel. Accordingly, we now authorize the holding of monthly priesthood leadership meetings that may include quorum members who may be especially invited to attend these meetings, monthly priesthood meetings, auxiliary regional meetings, and monthly union meetings where any such meetings may be held without violating the restrictions regarding the use of gasoline and rubber, and where the holding of such meetings will not interfere with quarterly conferences or other regularly established meetings. However, we do not, by these amended instructions, intend to authorize nor to countenance the holding of any of these meetings under circumstances which involve the violation of governmental rules and regulations regarding travel either by automobile or otherwise. NOTES TO THE FIELD 539 In this connection, we point out that experiences during the exigencies of war indicate that the visits of stake board members to wards produce even better results than having local officers and teachers travel to a central place for a monthly union meeting. Youth Need Guidance And Supervision In moving thus early to lift the ban hitherto placed upon the holding of Conventions and Union meetings, we are obedient to the necessity for close cooperation and personal contact between general and stake officers, and the young people of the Church. Every means that will foster such association must be made available wherever and whenever possible. The proper guidance of our children and youth is one of our paramount responsibilities. We are looking to those who represent the General Authorities in Priesthood and in Auxiliary work to discharge this responsibility in sincerity and prayerful devotion. Wherefore, now let every man learn his duty, and to act in the office in which he is appointed, in all diligence. He that is slothful shall not be counted worthy to stand, and he that learns not his duty and shows himself not approved shall not be counted worthy to stand. Even so. Amen. Sincerely your brethren, George Albert Smith J. Reuben Clark, Jr. David O. McKay The First Presidency Ward Relief Society Conferences, November 4, 1945 CONTINUING the plan first adopted in 1942 for auxiliaries to hold special meetings and annual conferences on Fast Sunday evenings, the Relief Society has again been assigned the evenings of Fast Day in November and March. Fast Day in November this year will occur November 4, and the General Board recommends that this evening be used for the annual ward Relief Society conference. Ward Relief Society presidents may therefore arrange with their respective bishops for holding meetings on the evening of Fast Day in November. This is a most favorable Sunday on which to hold the ward Relief Society conference, coming as it does only one month after the opening of the regular weekly meetings in October, thus affording opportunity for previewing the lessons and other work, near the beginning of the educational season. It is recommended: 1. That each ward conference be attended by a representative of the stake board who should be present at both the officers' meeting and the general session. 2. That each conference consist of  two meetings? a. An officers' meeting to be attended by the ward executive officers, special workers and class leaders, the ward bishop or his representative, and the visiting stake board member.
b. A general session for all Relief Society members and for the general membership of the ward.
The purposes of the officers' meeting are to discuss special problems confronting the ward Relief Society, and to provide opportunity for the stake board member to evaluate the condition of the ward Society and to advise, instruct, and stimulate the ward officers. In order to accomplish the purposes of the meeting, some stakes prepare a questionnaire or present and discuss data from the last annual report. At least one hour should be allowed for this meeting and, in some instances, a longer period may be required. The time for holding the officers' meeting is optional with wards, but should be at a time convenient for the visiting stake board member and bishop. For example, this meeting may be held immediately preceding the general session, as heretofore
suggested, the previous evening, or at some other time convenient for the bishop and visiting board member. This officers' meeting, held in connection with the ward conference, may constitute the monthly ward preparation meeting for the month in which the conference is held.
In order to insure a large attendance at the general session of the conference, it is recommended that advance announcement of the meeting be made in Relief Society and other ward gatherings. Relief Society members particularly should be urged to attend.
A suggestive program for use at ward conference will be sent to ward and stake presidents in bulletin form. Its use is optional and stakes and wards desiring to plan their own programs may do so. However, the General Board is very anxious that this meeting be used to acquaint ward members with the work of Relief Society and also with a view to enlisting the active participation of the women of the ward.
