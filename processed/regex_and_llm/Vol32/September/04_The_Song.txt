THE SONG Helen Kimball Orgill Tears and broken blossoms Woven into song, Boon of love evolving From life's thorn and thong. And For Eternity Olive Woolley Burt CHAPTER IV SYNOPSIS Delsa Marriott, jilted by Hugh Temple who is serving in Australia, begins to take an interest in the children of Jeff Holden, widower principal of the school where Delsa teaches. The townsfolk, who do not know of Hugh's change of heart, think that Delsa is interested in Jeff, and condemn her for her infidelity to Hugh. THE girls came noisily into the house, shaking their long curls, waving letters in their hands, hugging big knitting bags close to their hearts. Delsa greeted them gaily, with the special little comment that each one merited. These were her chums and playmates since babyhood, they were as familiar to her as if they had belonged to her own family. She knew of their absent sweethearts, their hopes, their dreams and longings. There's something very special about a small town?especially a small Utah town, Delsa thought, with everyone belonging to the same Church, knowing everyone else. It was just like one big family. They settled down to the business of the evening at last. The girls got out their sewing or knitting or crocheting and went to work. And as the others worked, one would read her letters, or bits of them?the bits she cared to share?each girl taking a turn. Delsa sat back in a corner working on the exquisite tablecloth she was crocheting, thinking, I can't read them Hugh's letter?not a word of it. I would break down and cry if I did. And I can't lie to them and say I haven't heard from Hugh, for his mother knows I have?and by this time, probably, every one of them knows it, too. What shall I say? Shall I say, "Well, girls, I am withdrawing from the War Widows! I no longer have a right to belong? I'm no longer engaged to Hugh Temple! Should I say that now and have it over with? Grace Metcalfe looked at Delsa's tablecloth and sniffed. "You'll never get that done, Delsa Marriott," she said, "if you don't hurry. I don't think it's grown a stitch since last meeting.*' Delsa made herself laugh. She was sure that Grace had heard that Hugh's mother was displeased at her going to Jeff Holden's every day. If nice little Millie Lewis had heard it, surely Grace, who missed nothing in the way of gossip, had heard, also. She was gently baiting Delsa, but Delsa was not going to be drawn into any discussion of her own affairs tonight. She made herself laugh brightly, and reply casually. Millie rushed to her rescue. "Delsa's got a surprise for you all tonight," she cried. "A big surprise!" Delsa looked up at her friend in astonishment. Millie had asked her to keep it a secret. Lina caught her breath sharply. She, too, had been made to promise secrecy. But Millie giggled, and would say no more. Page  She had succeeded in diverting their attention. They began to tease Millie and Delsa to tell them what she had planned, and Delsa was thankful for the minutes wasted in this nonsense, as they delayed the moment when the girls would ask, "And now, what did Hugh say in his last letter, Delsa?" But the demand came at last and Delsa, scarcely knowing what words she would say, looked at her friends and told them, quietly, "Hugh was lonely, girls. There isn't a word of his last letter that I can very well share with anyone. It was meant just for me?" The girls murmured, "Toor Hugh! Delsa, give us his last address and we'll all write to him! We'll cheer him up!" And Delsa heard Hugh's mother sniffle a little in the background, trying to let Delsa know that she felt sorry for her son, away off in Australia, loving, trusting the girl back home. Delsa glanced at the clock. "We'll have to have our refreshments now if we're going to be ready for the surprise," she said, and hurried out into the kitchen to prepare the cake and ice cream that was the standard party food. Her mother came to help her, but Hugh's mother moved on into the living room with the girls, tacitly taking her stand with them and Hugh and against Delsa. DELSA felt her lip curving in a bitter smile and shook her head angrily. Sour old maid, already! She thought, and you haven't even released Hugh yet. What will your lips look like ten years from now? They had scarcely finished the ice cream when they heard voices on the porch, and Jim Lewis burst into the room. "Surprise! Surprise!" giggled Millie, and Lina was in Jim's arms, radiant, "Oh, Jim, I could hardly bear it, waiting for you to come!" Now Delsa had no more fears for her own secret. Everyone was hugging Jim, pouring out eager questions, laughing. Relief was in their voices and their laughter?the same relief Delsa had felt when she had learned that Jim was home. Then she remembered Jim's buddy, and would have crowded past the little knot to make him welcome, but Jim saw her and went to her. "How's Delsa?" he asked, lifting her chin and kissing her lightly. "Oh, Jim!" she cried, and didn't mind the tears that blurred his familiar face. "Jim, it's so good to see you. You look so well!" "I brought my buddy along," Jim found the chance to say. "Back up, girls. I want you all to meet Alec Windsor. Alec, this is my sister's and Lina's crowd?shall I tell you their names now, or one by one, so you'll have half a chance to remember them?" Delsa's eyes went to the dark figure now beside Jim. He was like Hugh? that same eager, slanting-in-to-the-wind look about him; the same dark eyes and hair lifting from a tanned forehead. She held out her hand. "I'm Delsa Marriott," she said simply. "I'm glad you could come with Jim." Alec took her hand and looked down into her eyes. "Jim's told me about you?about AND FOR ETERNITY 553 all the girls here?I envied him. It was just as if he had a dozen or more sisters waiting here at home to make him happy. You look just as he said you would, Delsa." Jim, who had gone over to greet the two older women, now came and extricated Alec from the laughing girls, and took him across the room. Delsa, watching, could see how Hugh's mother stared at the boy's resemblance to her son; could see how she bent eagerly to welcome him; how she adopted Alec immediately. Her own mother said, '1 think there's a little ice cream left, if you boys would like a dish," and everyone roared with laughter. It was so like old times?like the high school days, when the same crowd of girls, calling themselves the Merry Old Maids, had met. When it was just about time for them to break up the party, all the boys their age?Hugh and Jim and Louis and the rest-would drop by to walk the girls home. And then Mrs. Marriott would say the same thing, "There's a little ice cream left," and would feed the whole crowd again. JIM and Alec loved the ice cream " and cake, and the two mothers beamed tenderly on them as they ate. Delsa thought, "I didn't realize how much, how dreadfully much, they miss the boys, too!" When they could eat no more, Jim looked longingly at the record player and said, ?I guess we couldn't have a dance or two, Delsa? I promise we'll not play favorites? but give you all a whirl, if you'll only let us. It's been so long since we had a real dance?" "Why, of course, Jim!" Delsa cried. "We'd love it! The old records need a little exercise?if they aren't dimmed with rust and dust from disuse." She selected one of the crowd's favorite discs and set it in place. The girls watched worshipfully as Jim put his arm about Lina and his cheek against her hair and started to dance. Alec went to Millie, and Delsa felt a strange ache in her heart as he began to circle the room with her chum. Delsa was changing the record when she felt Alec's tall form beside her. Her hands fumbled, and his firm brown fingers took the disc and placed it in position. He pressed the button and the record began to turn. "Our dance?" he said, and his arm went about her and she was dancing with him. Delsa's first thought was, it's heaven to be dancing again! Then she smiled to herself. She had danced many times since the boys left?danced with the men and the older school boys. But it wasn't the same. Alec had to bend his head to talk to her above the music, but he said, "Tm glad that I could come with Jim. I'm going to have a good time, I can see that plainly. And I hope you'll help." "Help?" Delsa asked, her straying thoughts not catching his meaning. "Yes!" he grinned down at her. "I'd like to," Delsa smiled, "but I doubt if I'll get a chance. You'll have more girls wanting to help you have a good time than you'll need!" "But have you ever noticed," he asked seriously, "that it isn't always the many that make the much?" She looked up at him, baffled, and he laughed down at her.
"I've found that one companion?the right one?can do more towards providing a good time than any number of miscellaneous folks," he explained.
They danced in silence for a moment, and then Alec asked "Do you have those here? But of course you do! Do you ride?"
When Delsa nodded he went on, "Well then, I appoint you chief guide and pointer-outer to show me the wonders of this valley. Jim will have no time, what with a wedding and a bride to look after, so I'll be left high and dry unless you take care of me."
Delsa smiled.
"Wait and see," she said.
Their dance over, Delsa sat beside Hugh's mother while the two boys danced with every girl in turn.
Delsa and her voice troubled, "Do you think he's like Hugh, Aunt Martha?"
"A little," Hugh's mother said judiciously, "only not nearly so good looking, of course, and not so tall. And his shoulders aren't broad like Hugh's?"
Suddenly Delsa felt the tension inside her dissolve and she smiled and gave Hugh's mother a quick, affectionate hug.
"That's just what I thought," she said.
Hugh's mother returned her friendliness. She patted Delsa's hand and said softly, "Poor boy! I feel so sorry for him?no mother, no family, no town full of friends waiting for him. I can't help thinking how it must be with Hugh?away off there in Australia. He's a stranger here, just like Alec is here, Delsa,
not knowing anyone. I hope somebody is trying to make him happy."
Bitterness twisted Delsa's lips again, and she turned her head so that Hugh's mother wouldn't see it, as she answered, "Someone is, Aunt Martha! Surely someone has taken Hugh under her wing!"
At last the evening was over and the crowd was leaving. Jim and Alec and the girls said their goodbyes and went laughing out into the clear, cool night?Jim with Lina, of course, and Alec Windsor walking with Millie.
DELSA stood in the open doorway, watching them go down the walk and turn into the road, going in different directions toward their homes. Then with a sigh she went back into the house and started picking up the things, straightening the rooms.
Hugh's mother said, "Don't do that tonight, Delsa. You're tired. Let's just leave everything, and I'll come over tomorrow morning and help your mother clear up."
Delsa was surprised at the gentleness in the woman's voice. After the disapproval of the early evening, this kindness seemed suddenly sweet and dear. Delsa smiled gratefully and said, "I hate to do that?leave my party things for you two to clean up!"
But her mother said, "You have to go to school tomorrow, Delsa, and we have the whole day to putter about in. Go on to bed."
"You'll maybe want to show that nice boy some of the sights around here," Hugh's mother suggested, insinuatingly, "the old mill up the canyon, or that abandoned mine, or the spot where the Indians held their powwows in pioneer days. So you go to bed now, it's late."
Delsa kissed the two women goodnight and went slowly upstairs. So that was it! They were holding out a very definite olive branch?she could take it and be in their good graces again, or she could ignore it and have that ugly bat of disapproval between them.
She smiled sadly, she understood them so well. Alec Windsor looked something like Hugh; he was a service man like Hugh; he was a stranger like Hugh?therefore, he was good and dear like Hugh. Also, and very important to them, he was betrothed to a WAC, a romantic figure beside whom Delsa, country school teacher, was colorless and ineffective.
So they would have her show Alec the sights, ride horseback with him, talk to him?even flirt with him if he wanted to do a little harmless flirting on his month's furlough. Then he would go away, and Hugh's Delsa would be safe and wholly Hugh's again. She would have shaken off her interest in Jeff Holden and Jeff's children.
Well, Delsa thought, as she lay staring out of the window, across the dark toward Hugh's old room, why not? She had no interest in Jeff, except to help him out because so desperately needed help. And she had no interest in Alec, either. But if they wanted her to take their medicine she would take it?and with a vengeance.
She sat up in bed with sudden resolution. Maybe they were, unwittingly, giving her the answer to her own secret problem! She could be nice to Alec at first, as if just to please them. Then she could let them think that she had fallen in love with him?the nebulous plan in her mind began to take shape?furtive and secret, but definite.
Maybe she could make Alec think she was in love with him?what if he did belong to another? Hadn't a stranger stolen Hugh from her? She could get even with them all this way?and what did it matter what her own feelings were?
With her plan slowly growing in her mind, Delsa lay back on her pillow and slept.

SPECIAL PROGRAMS Big Cottonwood Stake (Utah) ALTA J. VANCE, President of "Mt. Olympus Ward Relief Society, and recently appointed president of Big Cottonwood Stake, reports the following anniversary program: "The Mt. Olympus Ward Relief Society celebrated the 103d anniversary of the Relief Society on March 13, 1945. The morning was spent in regular work-day activities. Eighteen Singing Mothers, after taking part on the program in a neighboring ward, returned and joined in the luncheon and program which were enjoyed by more than sixty members. The birthday cake centered the table which was decorated with daffodils, blue candles, and miniature pioneer women. Early days and procedures of the Relief Society organization were brought to mind by the program which included dances of former days by sisters in costumes. Children, who were usually taken care of in a separate room, were invited to join in the fun." SINGING MOTHERS OF MT. OLYMPUS WARD, BIG COTTONWOOD STAKE, (UTAH) Page  MEMBERS OF MT.

South Sanpete Stake (Utah) ELVIRA MELLOR, former first counselor, Manti Center Ward Relief Society, reports an anniversary program held Tuesday, March 13, 1945. The theme was "Relief Society, Keeper of the Golden Key." A character representing Emma Hale, the first to hold the Golden Key, gave a brief summary of events at the initial organization and led in singing "The Spirit of God Like a Fire Is Burning." "Charity" was introduced who spoke of her part in Relief Society. Then "Music" told of the benefits she adds to the organization. A character depicting Emmeline B. Wells explained woman's educational privileges attained through Relief Society and told of the study courses instituted during her presidency. A stake board member then gave her interpretation of Relief Society's future frontiers. The majesty and power of Relief Society cannot be measured; no one but God alone can determine the treasured heights of love, the breadth of charity, or sound the depths of knowledge. The scope of our work, the possibilities of our development, are bounded only by woman's capacities and eventualities. The Relief Society is as broad as eternity, as far-reaching as love, and holds the Golden Key for richer blessings above. South Los Angeles Stake (Calif.) SISTER MAUDE McOMIE, second counselor in the South Los Angeles Stake Relief Society, reports the following unusual program: "Commemorating the one-hundred and third birthday and anniversary on March 7th, the South Los Angeles Stake Relief Society arranged an unique affair. ?To put on a program in the stake house would not be unusual, and with the thought of our war mothers, their anguish of soul for their sons and husbands, we wanted to do something for them, to reach out a kindly hand and have them feel and realize our love for them. This could not be done individually, but collectively we could convey, in a measure, some gesture that would be fitting and appropriate to honor these women. With this in mind, we remembered the beautiful window The Last Supper' at Forest Lawn Memorial Park. What a beautiful setting it would make for a program! They could view the window, listen, and think of the sacrifice Christ made for them. In contemplating the greatness of this sacrifice they could derive comfort in knowing that he understood the suffering of their hearts. "Out of this grew the following program: Welcome Mrs. Blanche M. Johnson "The Holy City" by Stephen Adams Hyrum J. Christiansen, tenor Invocation Mr. W. W. LeCheminant "Meditation" from Thais by Jules Massenet Merwin Waite, violinist The Story of "The Last Supper" Window Mr. James Herron, narrator "In the Desert of Waiting" by Annie Fellows Johnson Mrs. Erma Peterite, dramatic reader "In the Garden" by C. Austin Miles Mr. Christiansen Tribute to War Mothers and Wives President Noble Waite Benediction Mrs. Lillian Collings Taps Mrs. Glenna Nelson "The setting alone was a glorious sight, and something that mere words cannot describe. "At the conclusion of the program each gold-star mother was presented with a corsage, a token of love from the stake board. Following this, the haunting beauty of taps echoed through the beautiful 'Court of Honor Building'." Mt. Graham Stake (Arizona) TRELLA ELLSWORTH, President of Layton Ward Relief Society, and Clare K. Claridge, Secretary of Mt. Graham Stake Relief Society, wrote in April of this year: "The Layton Ward Relief Society of the Mt. Graham Stake celebrated the March 17 anniversary with a banquet for the mothers and daughters of the ward. There were about 150 present and among them a family of four generations, Sister Ida Norton, her daughter. Belle Tal-ley, her daughter, Eula John, and her daughter, Loretta John. "All assembled in the chapel where beautiful music was played. When all had arrived they were ushered into the banquet hall. The tables were decorated with beautiful flowers of various colors. At the head table were seated the Relief Society presidency, with their daughters, and one of the stake board members. In the center of the table was a very lovely birthday cake made by one of the members of the Society. "After being seated, President Trella Ellsworth welcomed all and announced the program. 'America the Beautiful' was sung, led by Mildred Ellsworth, with Anna Bentley at the piano. Invocation by a mother, Verna Evans. NOTES FROM THE FIELD 561 LAYTON WARD RELIEF SOCIETY, MT.

ANNUAL PICNIC OF THE LINCOLN WARD RELIEF SOCIETY', (TACOMA), SEATTLE STAKE, (WASHINGTON) Photograph submitted by Vilate C. Bottoms, secretary Work Meeting Plan now for Christmas AN APRON DAY FOR CHRISTMAS GIFTS CHRISTMAS will be upon us before we know it! Conditions this year present a real opportunity for Relief Society to help its members make lovely gifts for Christmas out of materials they may have on hand. Let us plan the three remaining Relief Society work meetings before Christmas most carefully, so that they will be profitable for all who attend. In addition to necessary work-meeting activities, let us offer special projects designed to interest women who have not hitherto taken an active part in work meetings. There is a way to catch and hold the interest of every woman in the ward if the right way can be found. In order to find it, it is necessary to study carefully the needs of the particular group to which you wish to appeal and try out a number of activities that would seem to meet their special needs. If our program is organized to take care of all members who attend the meeting, we will be able to hold them and help them to solve many of their problems. The women who are interested and busy are not the ones who slip out and go home. Almost every woman makes or buys aprons to be given as Christmas gifts. We all delight to receive one, but how often the delight changes to disappointment when the aprons are tried on and are found to be uncomfortable and poor fitting. This year, when good materials are so difficult to get, it is more important than ever to have those who in the past have given "just any apron" consider whether the style and fit they select will be suitable for the one who will wear the apron. One ward with a very enterprising work leader planned a most successful apron day last fall. By looking ahead she was able to purchase enough materials and trimmings for the use of her group. No organdy ruffling was obtainable, but she found an organdy curtain which she had hemstitched in strips. This provided plenty of ruffling. Other trimming was picked up here and there, and soon the class leader had a very interesting assortment of materials and findings for her day. Patterns were selected carefully so that there were some suitable to each material and to every type of figure. Invitations were given to the ward women to come, purchase their materials, cut their aprons, and sew and fit them in the regular work meeting. Making aprons in a group is fun Page  because many ideas may be exchanged. Even though a ward leader may feel that she cannot purchase enough material this year for her entire group, such a day could still be carried out by using all the material available and having every woman who has an apron length of print tucked away in her home bring it for her own use. Odd lengths of bindings, bias tape, rickrack, and bits of lace, too, might be donated. When they are all brought together it will be astonishing to discover what can be done with them. Every tiny scrap can be utilized some way in Relief Society. Save odd pieces of material for toys or gift wrappings which will be discussed in future articles in the Magazine on activities for work-meeting days. This year let us help each other to see the possibilities in the things that are on hand. see: "Combination Apron and Sewing Bag,", pages 96-97. "Utility Aprons,", page 183.

I fashioned them from bits of Swiss With dots like falling snow, And lest they seem too wintry, I appliqued bright flowers In a saucy row. I shined and polished every pane. To feel the sunlight's golden kiss, And prayed, "Oh, Father, Bless all the world With peace and joy like this!" LESSON DEPARTMENT Theology Church History Lesson 3?The Journey Westward Dr. H. Wayne Driggs For Tuesday, December 4, 1945 Objective: To trace the march of the saints westward, and to show that physical hardship can be more easily endured by those who are supported by the spirit of the Lord than by those who are without his spirit. WHEN the Lord set his hand to fulfill his promise and gather Israel, far-reaching were the results. Especially was this true in regard to the journey of the Mormon pioneers. To trace the westward march of the Mormon pioneers under the vigorous hand of President Brigham Young makes real the beginning scenes of God's promise to bring again Israel. A few comparisons of the journey of Israel of old with that of its modern counterpart are interesting. Under Moses were a people of one tongue, having the same customs and racial background that living as a nation brings. Brigham Young led a band of people whose roots were deep within no one nation but many, for the gospel call was to all the world. Ancient Israel was fed manna by the hand of the Lord; the pioneers of our day not only carried their own provisions, but, of necessity, had to plant en route for others to reap. It was to a land of milk and honey, of fertile soil and vineyards, that God sent his people in the days of yore; the modern Israelites for the cause of Zion had left homes of comfort to go into a wilderness, a vast terrain, which early trappers doubted could be made successfully to yield any crop. Had not the Lord planted in the hearts of these pioneers a faith in his word, the marvelous work of the latter days could never have been accomplished. Let it not be felt that suffering and pain were always the lot of the saints, though great indeed at times was their anguish. There was always a joy of spirit which blessed their efforts and made even the physical hardships lighter. To know the true heart of these souls is to know the perfect balance in life between material and spiritual values. With threats, day in and day out, from mobocrats and corrupt government officials, the saints learned to hold their peace and live. Page  For them it was the kingdom of God first, with the assurance that all else would be added. Such a spirit made them build the Nauvoo Temple, knowing their joy within its walls was to be only a matter of months. In fact, this beautiful edifice was not dedicated until after the great majority of the saints was on the march, having left to some three hundred persons the satisfaction of presenting to the Lord, in ceremonial prayer, this most stately of structures then to be found upon the upper windings of the Mississippi River. Nor were these people without their music and dancing. It is recorded within the diaries of many that after the ordinances of the day had been performed in the House of the Lord, there was often a period of recreation. To cover, within the allotted words for this lesson, even a hundredth part of the story of the journey from Nauvoo to the valleys of the mountains would demand the most strict editing of the facts. It is hoped, therefore, that while presenting this interesting part of our history, the teacher will bring to the class, whenever possible, the diaries of pioneers, together with any of their personal effects long preserved and cherished from early days: a fancy pair of gloves, a piece of prized silver, an exquisite shawl, a hand-painted dish or other such loved appointments of the cultured home. These things, somehow, found their way into the barrel bottoms, the odd box corners, and, often, an opportune opening in a wagon-bed. Here was a people sensitive. Too, to the fine arts of living even in the midst of hard requirements which schooled the heart to forego the luxuries. It was the spirit of the Lord, day and night, that made possible the arduous journey across the plains. A firm belief in him and his word put courage in the step and faith in the heart. Ever bear in mind this thought to understand fully the zeal with which the saints traveled on each different day with the hope for better things. What are the significant facts of the pioneers' journey westward? In the dead of winter, the first of the saints crossed the Mississippi from Nauvoo to begin the trek. It was Wednesday, the 4th of February, 1846. Two days later ferrying began in earnest. At the same time as this march by land began, there set sail from the New York harbor the S. S. Brooklyn, to carry by sea around Cape Horn and on to San Francisco two hundred and thirty-five members of the Church. Loaded within this vessel was also a good supply of all kinds of farming implements, tools for the carpenter, the blacksmith, and the wheelwright, together with the machinery for two gristmills and a sawmill. In addition, there were books on various subjects, a press with type and enough paper to start the printed word among the saints when they should arrive in their new-found home. Samuel Brannan was given the directions for this undertaking. It was to become a helping hand, extending material aid to the other companies of foot-weary emigrants whose weighted wagons, of necessity, had to load lightly the iron implements so needed to break the valley sod. LESSON DEPARTMENT 567 To those who were to travel by land or sea came the word from President Young: When the time comes to start westward we will continue to gather until Israel is gathered: let there be no feelings about who shall go first; those who go first will lay the foundations for those who shall come after, and none will be neglected in their time (D. H. C. Vol. VIL, P- 575)- Most of the month of February was spent, by those preparing for the journey by wagons, at a camp on Sugar Creek, Iowa, while, day by day, additional families rolled in to swell the number of exiles. Council meetings were held both at the camp and back in Nauvoo to lay plans for caring for the destitute and needy, many of whom had rushed off without proper supplies for the journey. President Young was prompted to give direct instructions to members of the camp as follows: I wish the brethren to stop running to Nauvoo, hunting, fishing, roasting their shins, idling away their time, and fix nose-baskets for their horses, and save their corn, and fix comfortable places for their wives and children to ride, and never borrow without asking leave, and be sure to return what was borrowed, lest your brother be vexed with you and in his anger curse you and then you would be cursed according to the power of the priesthood that brother possesses and evil will come upon you (D. H. C. Vol. VI, p. 586). In this winter outpost much suffering from the cold was endured. Nine infants were born at Sugar Creek during those February days. Dr. Richards recorded in his journal for the 19th: The wind blew steadily from the northwest accompanied by snow which fell to a depth of seven or eight inches, but much thawed as it fell, the storm was unceasing, and the evening was very cold (D. H. C. Vol. VI, p. 593). March of 1846 came in like a lion, and in its extreme cold the camp at Sugar Creek broke up. The journey west began in earnest. All through this month and the month of April which followed, the steady stream of saints pushed over the heavy soil of Iowa with its grassy and rolling lands and deep ravines. By April 24, some one hundred and forty-five miles west of Nauvoo, a camp site was selected and named Garden Grove. Here, within a short period, a thriving village was set upon a clearing. Samuel Bent was named president with Aaron Johnson and David Fullmer as counselors to direct this camp of Israel. Here, many of the saints were to remain, build, and plant for those who were to come after. President Brigham Young saw the need of holding ground while extending ever westward the march to the mountains. By now the great body of the saints had left Nauvoo. May brought the return of spring to the prairies. By the 18th, President Young, in company with Parley P. Pratt and others, found joy in the sights there were on every hand. Elder Pratt writes: One day riding about three or four miles through beautiful prairies, I came suddenly to some round and sloping hills, grassy, and crowned with beautiful groves of timber; while alternate open groves and forests seemed blended in all the beauty and harmony of an English park. While beneath and beyond, on the west, rolled a main branch of the Grand River, with its rich bottoms of alternate forest and prairie. As I approached this lovely scenery, several deer and wolves, being startled at the sight of me, abandoned the place and bounded away till lost from my sight and the groves. Being pleased and excited at the varied beauty before me, I cried out "this is Mount Pisgah" (D. H. C. Vol. VI, p. 607). With joy and the returning hope of the new season of the year, the saints set about building their second camp of major importance in Iowa. Land was fenced and preparations begun for planting and home building. William Huntington, Ezra T. Benson, and Charles C. Rich were chosen to take charge. But for President Young and his party the call was to press on. Over Indian trails and rude bridges they traveled until, on June 14, they arrived at the banks of the muddy Missouri not far from Council Bluffs. They were then in the land of the Potawatomis, a friendly tribe whose chiefs were kind. By the 29th, companies were ferrying across the river. At Council Bluffs, President Young waited to gather in the long train of companies, for he was desirous of giving his people instructions. When some five hundred wagons had wheeled in, their leader addressed the saints assembled. He warned them to be faithful to the Lord and press on. Wicked men would seek to prevent them from doing so, he said, but the saints would find the place to which the Lord would have them go if they would heed his words. Things now seemed right for the journey to continue, the summer months lay ahead and the Platte River with its green banks and shallow eddies lay flattened out some five hundred miles across the level plains of Nebraska. Here was the life-line of shade and drink for the travelers. Then came Wyoming and its Sweetwater leading high into the bracing air of the Rockies. Yes, the journey from here on gave a feeling of uplift and freedom in the heart. Then, too, it was June time of the year. On the closing day of this month came word from Washington. Captain James Allen of the United States Army arrived on the 30th to put an end to dreams. His credentials were for the raising of five hundred men to serve as volunteers in the war with Mexico, recently declared. Strange that a government which would permit thousands of its citizens to be mobbed, now should turn and ask such a people for the flower of their manhood to fight a war. Here was a chance for the saints to turn the other cheek, and this they did courageously. Five hundred men stepped forth within a period of weeks to complete the longest march in the history of the United States infantry. They not only wrote a chapter in the story of Mormon allegiance to the flag, but they were blessed to come through the war unharmed. "Detachments of the battalion who wintered at Pueblo... Together with the main body of the Mississippi Saints entered the Salt Lake Valley, under direction of Captain James Brown," only five days after the arrival of the original company, bringing with them sixty wagons, one hundred head of fine horses and mules, and three hundred head of cattle. LESSON DEPARTMENT 569 How strange the ways of the Lord! Had it been written that upon the arrival of most of the saints in the promised land, domestic animals and modern wains would be there to greet them, would not this have taken a test of faith to believe! But this did not come to pass, however, without sacrifices, for because of the weakened condition of the main body of the saints, with the able-bodied men gone, it became necessary to make preparations for the coming winter. It was a bitter season of snow these exiles spent at Winter Quarters. Many lived in dugouts along the muddy bluffs not far from the Missouri River. At least the saints were consoled in the thought that they had been given permission to remain in that country, and had there found a true friend in Colonel Thomas L. Kane, who importuned the President of the United States in their behalf. Today, as solemn testimony of the bleak winter spent in Nebraska, there stands upon a hill in Florence a Mormon cemetery, within whose graves lie the bodies of many saints and those of infants born but to die of exposure in the cold. With their faces toward the east they await the call of a brighter morn. With the davming of the year 1847 came the voice of the Lord to:... President Brigham Young, at Winter Quarters, giving instructions for the guidance of the camps of Israel on their journeyings to the west. The Saints were to be organized into companies, with captains over hundreds, fifties and tens, as the case had been while journeying across Iowa. These companies were to be presided over by a president and two counselors, under the direction of the Twelve Apostles, who were at the head of all the camps of Israel. The Saints were to enter into a covenant "to keep all the commandments and statutes of the Lord. (Joseph Fielding Smith, Essentials in Church History, p. 433). It was further the command of the Lord that departure for the West should be early in the spring in order to provide for the planting of crops. April 5, 1847, was the day when the march began. On up the north side of the Platte River it went, over the south pass of the Rocky Mountains, past Fort Bridger, west through Echo and East Canyons, then on to Big and Little Mountains which pointed to Emigration Canyon and the Valley of the Great Salt Lake. Stories of the landmarks of the plains, the forts, the Indians, the wild beasts and the travelers met en route, go to make up this eventful trek, until, from a bed in a carriage. President Young raised himself to look over the valley in the heart of the mountains and say, "This is the place, drive on." It was in July, the month commemorating independence, that the saints arrived. Grateful and happy they were to mark their day of freedom in a new land as the 24th, which, singularly enough, counted the exact number of years since the Angel Moroni first brought the restored gospel to the Prophet Joseph Smith. Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggested readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first, answer the question; second, read the assigned part in the text to discover wherein we must "give heed unto his word." 1. As early as six months after the organization of the Church the Lord, speaking through his prophet Joseph Smith, said the gathering of his elect "into one place upon the face of this land" must take place (Doc. And Gov. 29:8). Why are we as a people in a better position today to under stand the wisdom of the Lord in sounding such a call than were the few saints who were present when the revelation was given in September of 1830? In drawing out the answer to this question have the class reflect upon the world conditions today. These may be listed. Read Doc. and Cov. sections 1, 38, 88, 93 in the Doc. and Cov. Commentary. Found in these verses. Read any section in Doc. and Cov. 33.
Have section 136 of the Doctrine and Covenants read with its introductory paragraph. Pay particular attention to the following parts of the revelation: verses 3, 6, 8, 10, 16, 20, 28, 31, 35, 36, 39. In the light of the lesson have these discussed.
3. What are some of the interesting facts you know of the journey to the Rocky Mountains? Read chapters 37, 38, 39 in Essentials in Church History.
The following questions may be used if needed for further class activity or they may be assigned for home study. What facts of human interest may be gained from the diaries of the pioneers? Read "Through Diaries of Long Ago," Children's Friend, July 1942.
Special Note: Be sure to make full use of other material in the July 1944 issue of Thefor study in connection with the course in Church History.

Visiting Teachers' Messages Sources of Strength?Charity Lesson 3?Charity Envieth Not Dr. Lowell L. Bennion For Tuesday, December 4, 1945
Objective: To show that the cultivation of the spirit of charity will rid our lives of envy.
ENVY works on the mind much as cancer does on the body. Instead of enriching the mind from without, it destroys it from within. Envy is a product of covetousness; it looks upon and desires that which is not its own, but upon that which belongs to another. Its ways are unholy evil: envy keeps one in misery by focusing his attention on that which he lacks; at the same time, it diverts one's energy from acquiring objects of one's desire in a profitable and legitimate way; and envy
causes one to dislike, and even to hate, the person who possesses that which he desires for himself.
Envy cannot be conquered by a frontal attack, by concentrating on the evil itself. To rid our lives of envy, we must look first for its cause, and second, to some power even greater than envy itself with which to erase it.
Envy has its roots in our own lack. It is an admission that we are not prepared to live a rich, soul-satisfying life. LESSON DEPARTMENT 571 Living the gospel win enable us to overcome the feeling of lack in our lives and rob envy of its nourishment. Alma tells us that, if we will plant the seed of faith (in the word of God) in our hearts, and nourish it with patience until it takes root in us, that by and by we?... Shall pluck the fruit thereof, which is most precious, which is sweet above all that is sweet, and which is white above all that is white, yea, and pure above all that is pure; and ye shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are filled, that ye hunger not, neither shall ye thirst (Alma 32:42 also note verses 27-43). "Charity seeketh not her own." She rejoices in the success of others. She is aware, not of her own needs, but of the needs of others. Hers is the spirit of giving, of helping, of loving. A heart full of charity has no place in it for envy. Literature The Bible in Our Literature Lesson 3?Bible Influences As Revealed in Our Lyric Literature Dr. Howard R. Driggs For Tuesday, December 18, 1945 Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace. Good will toward men. THIS heavenly lyric, voiced by angels over gentle Bethlehem in the long, long ago, touches the heart of our study. Its soulful lines carry a message of divine meaning for wayward humanity. They point the way toward heaven. This inspiring song is sometimes called the first of Christmas carols. Carol singing among human folk, however, did not come until more than a thousand years following that holy night. And yet, it was the inspiration of that beautiful song and the coming of the Christ child it heralded which gave to us the car- (Luke 2:14) ols we love to sing to help keep Christmas a holy day. In a true sense, a carol is a song of praise for a festal occasion. As Christianity was spread among the common folk, their joyousness began to find expression, particularly at Christmas time, in singing praise to the Savior. Lyric lines springing out of their hearts became, with time, charming folk songs; and the best loved of these were passed on through the years. From this rich heritage we get such soul-lifting expressions as the following; It came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old, From angels bending near the earth, to touch their harps of gold; Peace on earth, good will to men; from heav'n's gracious king. The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing. O come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant; O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem; Come and behold him, born the king of angels; O come let us adore him, O come let us adore him, O come let us adore him, Christ the Lord! Some of our gifted writers, catching the spirit of the folk carols, have created lyrics which take place with those time-honored songs. Among these are Luther's "Cradle Hymn" and "Silent Night, Holy Night" by Franz Gruber, known by heart and sung in many tongues. Another that holds our affection for its sweetness and light is "O Little Town of Bethlehem" by Phillips Brooks, inspired on a Christmas Eve spent by him in this town where the Savior was born. Following is the first stanza of that beautiful song: O little town of Bethlehem! How still we see thee lie; Above thy deep and dreamless sleep, The silent stars go by; Yet in thy dark streets shineth The everlasting light; The hopes and fears of all the years Are met in thee tonight. All down the years the story of the Christ child, with the angels and the shepherds, the star and the wise men, has been the inspiration of lyric expression. Countless songs have been and are still being created around this theme. Another sacred theme that has profoundly influenced our lyric literature is the resurrection of the Savior. To a world groping in spiritual darkness, this divine event brought radiant light. With the sublime revelation that man can rise from the tomb into immortal existence, life took on new meaning, more heavenly purpose. For art expression, it was the opening of a new vista, arched by a rainbow of hope for a more glorious future. Lyric lines, expressive of faith in immortality, accepting death as a part of the eternal life plan, as but a portal opening into a larger life, are to be found in many outstanding poems. Following are a few such sincere and helpful expressions: Life is real! Life is earnest! And the grave is not its goal; Dust thou art, to dust returneth. Was not spoken of the soul. ?"Psalm of Life," Longfellow Ah, well for us all some sweet hope lies Deeply buried from human eyes. And in the hereafter angels may Roll the stone from its grave away. ?"Maud Muller," Whittier #? * I stay my haste, I make delays? For what avails this eager pace? I stand amid the eternal ways And what is mine shall know my face. ?"Waiting," John Burroughs * ?# Sunset and evening star, And one clear call for me! And may there be no moaning of the bar, When I put out to sea. But such a tide as moving seems asleep. Too full for sound and foam. When that which drew from out the boundless deep Turns again home. Twilight and evening bell. And after that the dark And may there be no sadness of farewell. When I embark; LESSON DEPARTMENT 573 For though from out our bourne of Time and Place The flood may bear me far, I hope to meet my Pilot face to face When I have crossed the bar. ?"Crossing the Bar," Tennyson Another appealing theme was found in the loving service of the Savior. His living lessons in true charity, tolerance, brotherhood, neighborliness, and other Christian virtues have been a constant inspiration to authors. Illustrations that follow are typical of thousands of lines that echo the divine precepts and example of the Master in making the gospel live among men: She never found fault with you, never implied Your wrong by her right; and yet men at her side Grew nobler, girls purer, as through the whole town The children were gladder that pulled at her gown? ?"My Kate," Elizabeth Barrett Browning *?? It is not just as we take it. This mystical world of ours. Life's field will yield as we make it A harvest of thorns or of flowers. ?"Perseverance," Goethe KY God send us a little home To come back to when we roam. Red firelight and deep chairs. Small white beds upstairs. Homely flowers in brown sod. Overhead thy stars, O God! ?"Prayer for Home," Anonymous If I can stop one heart from breaking, I shall not live in vain; If I can ease one life the aching.... I shall not live in vain. ?"Success," Emily Dickinson I see from my house by the side of the road, By the side of the highway of life. The men who press on with the ardor of hope. The men who are faint with the strife. But I turn not away from their smiles nor their tears? Both parts of an infinite plan; Let me live in a house by the side of the road And be a friend of man. ?"The House by the Side of the Road," Sam Walter Foss All such poetical expressions serve to further the great purpose of the Savior in bringing the gospel to earth. He spent his life doing good among men. Lyrical lines such as these help us to see more clearly the inner meaning of his divine work, and to feel something of the joy of our Father in heaven when we follow in the footsteps of his Only Begotten Son. It was something of this thought that inspired James Whitcomb Riley when he penned in homely dialect the little poem called ?Jim?? a tribute to a self-sacrificing shoemaker. Jim was always giving, always helping and cheering those who came to his shop. Even in his closing days, when an incurable illness was taking his strength, the kindly cobbler had ever a pleasant word to give to others. And after he had passed to his reward, the poet has one of Jim's fellow workers say tenderly: When God made Jim, I bet he didn't do anything else that day But jest set around and feel good. No small contribution to the bringing of the Savior into our daily lives has been made by gifted poets of our own faith. Songs of their creation that we love to sing not only keep us actively helpful, but also lift us closer to a heaven of reality, where the warmth of both father and mother love awaits those who win salvation through a life of righteousness. This appealing truth finds most artistic expression in "O My Father," a lyric prayer by Eliza R. Snow, which ranks among the finest of religious poems. Besides the wealth of carols and hymns, anthems and oratorios linking directly with the Bible, there is a wealth of other lyrics that are in tune with its spirit. Songs of innocent childhood, of nature in all her moods, of home and friends, of pure love, of loyalty and patriotism?all are in consonance with true religion. Lines like these that follow surely lift us a little nearer heaven: My heart leaps up when I behold a rainbow in the sky. ?Wordsworth The little bird sits at his door in the sun A-tilt like a blossom among the leaves. ?Lowell I can hear the robin's warble and the meadowlark's sweet trills All around the dear old homestead lyin' there among the hills. ?Harrison R. Merrill But the air's so appetizin'; and the landscape through the haze Of a crisp and sunny morning of the early autumn days Is a pictur' that no painter has the colorin' to mock? When the frost is on the pumpkin and the fodder's in the shock. ?"When the Frost Is On the Punkin," James Whitcomb Riley It has been a long evening. I have watched A sky of clouds go by. God lent A crown of sunshafts To flash and fall away. I am content. ?Leon Loofbourow Think every morning when the birds peep through The dim, leaf-latticed windows of the grove. How jubilant the happy birds renew Their old melodious madrigals of love! And when you think of this, remember, too, 'Tis always morning somewhere, and above The awakening continents from shore to shore Somewhere the birds arc singing evermore. ?Longfellow I'm hungering in the city for the smell of fragrant timber. For the valleys where the birchbark smoke goes curling through the trees. For the lazy miles of lakeshore, where the blue waves kiss the pebbles, In the land of skyblue water, up beyond the inland seas. ?May Stanley And last, this soul-stirring stanza from a nineteen-year-old American air pilot who gave his life to help preserve our freedom: Up, up the long delirious blue I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace Where never lark, or even eagle flew? And while with silent lifting mind I've trod The high untrespassed sanctity of grace, Put out my hand and touched the face of God. ?John G. Magee, Jr. Discussion and Activities 1.

THE CLOSE OF LIFE Evelyn Fjelsted Shall not the close of life be sweet-Like coming home some tranquil day When one has wished so long to come, But home seemed ever far away? Like knowing suddenly there was No cause at all for grief or fear When one has been so much afraid And nothing in the world seemed clear;' Like realizing that, at last, A burden one has carried long Is laid aside and one is free To live again with hope and song; Like seeing life?yes, glorious life In all its grand simplicity. When life has seemed complex and strange. When one has seen small victory? MOUNTAIN SONG Ivy Houtz Woolley My heart is singing wild, a mountain song; The mountain tops are singing back to me! The gay-toned melodies now wing along, And murmur, as they pass, that I am free. Yes, free to dance upon the world's wide rim. And free to soar into the changing skies. My feet keep time to this tumultuous hymn, My blood through every secret channel flies, My throat bursts forth in a melodious strain. The crags ring back an echo, and I hear A flood of sound, swept in like breeze-tossed rain; A thousand symphonies play in my ear. Sing! Mountain, sing! Nor miss a single beat? I cast me down in homage at your feet! Page 576 The Church Offers Young Latter-day Saints THE BEST IN COLLEGE TRAINING By Maintaining The
