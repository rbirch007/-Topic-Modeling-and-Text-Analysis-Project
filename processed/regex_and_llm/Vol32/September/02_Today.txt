Today, 102,000 women are awaiting the beginning of the regular weekly meetings for the 1945-46 season. The objective as set forth by the Prophet will be adhered to carefully, adapted to present-day conditions and in line with present-day Church procedures.
Welfare work will receive a great deal of our time, with full support being given to the Church Welfare Plan. Concern for neighbors will be emphasized. Page 536 EDITORIAL 537 WE must "cherish" one another, and graciously and willingly render service that will bring comfort and happiness into the lives of one another. Homemaking, too, will receive special emphasis during the coming season. It is the duty of Relief Society to train women to be skilled housekeepers and good homemakers. Attendance at Relief Society should give women an enlarged vision of the importance of maintaining their homes according to Latter-day Saint standards. Officers are urged to enlist young women as members of the Society, and to interpret and conduct the program so that it will attract them and meet their needs. The Latter-day Saint viewpoint and the spirit of the gospel should characterize all that is done in Relief Society, and the testimony of the truth of the restored gospel should be strengthened in every woman attending. Let us each resolve to be among those who approach the beginning of this season's work with enthusiasm, full of faith in that which has been initiated, and determined that the outcome of the year's work will be successful and glorious. -B. S. S. THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES "Other misfortunes may be borne, or their effects overcome. If disastrous wars should sweep our commerce from the ocean, another generation may renew it; if it exhaust our treasury, future industry may replenish it; if it desolate and lay waste our fields, still, under a new cultivation, they will grow green again, and ripen to future harvests. "It were but a trifle even if the walls of yonder Capitol were to crumble, if its lofty pillars should fall, and its gorgeous decorations be all covered by the dust of the valley. All these may be rebuilt. "But who shall reconstruct the fabric oi demolished government? "Who shall rear again the well-proportioned columns of constitutional liberty? "Who shall frame together the skillful architecture which unites national sovereignty with State rights, individual security, and public prosperity? "No, if these columns fall, they will be raised not again. Like the Coliseum and the Parthenon, they will be destined to a mournful and a melancholy immortality. Bitterer tears, however, will flow over them than were ever shed over the monuments of Roman or Grecian art; for they will be the monuments of a more glorious edifice than Greece or Rome ever saw, the edifice of constitutional American liberty." ?Daniel Webster, "Eulogy on General Washington," (1832). Notes TO THE FIELD Auxiliary Regional Meetings and Monthly Union Meetings Authorized COPIES of the following letter "Further Instructions Regarding Conventions and Union Meetings" over the signature of the First Presidency of the Church were mailed to Relief Society stake presidents. It is reprinted herewith for the information of Relief Society officers: July 16, 1945 To Church Officers, Dear Brethren and Sisters: Further Instructions Regarding Conventions and Union Meetings Because of limitations set on automotive travel, the General Church Authorities on January 17, 1942, speaking through the First Presidency, advised General Boards of Auxiliary Organizations to discontinue the holding of monthly Union meetings, Institutes, and Conventions. Later, the Government itself placed a limitation upon assemblies throughout the entire country. The suspension of Unions and Conventions, of course, made less effective direct contact of Stake Boards as such with wards and branch officers and teachers, but placed greater responsibility upon the ward and branch organizations. We commend the local officers and teachers upon their willingness, ability, and increased effort to guide and instruct the members of their respective organizations during this Page 538 critical war-time period. It is gratifying, indeed, to note how efficiently the quorums and auxiliary organizations have functioned notwithstanding the limitations and difficulties under which they have had to labor. Occasional visits by General Board members to wards, stakes and districts requesting special help have contributed to increased efficiency in class work and in general spiritual uplift. A recent ruling by the Office of Price Administration, increasing the amount of gasoline for "A" coupons seems to point to such a relaxation with regard to the use of gasoline as will permit additional travel. Accordingly, we now authorize the holding of monthly priesthood leadership meetings that may include quorum members who may be especially invited to attend these meetings, monthly priesthood meetings, auxiliary regional meetings, and monthly union meetings where any such meetings may be held without violating the restrictions regarding the use of gasoline and rubber, and where the holding of such meetings will not interfere with quarterly conferences or other regularly established meetings. However, we do not, by these amended instructions, intend to authorize nor to countenance the holding of any of these meetings under circumstances which involve the violation of governmental rules and regulations regarding travel either by automobile or otherwise. NOTES TO THE FIELD 539 In this connection, we point out that experiences during the exigencies of war indicate that the visits of stake board members to wards produce even better results than having local officers and teachers travel to a central place for a monthly union meeting. Youth Need Guidance And Supervision In moving thus early to lift the ban hitherto placed upon the holding of Conventions and Union meetings, we are obedient to the necessity for close cooperation and personal contact between general and stake officers, and the young people of the Church. Every means that will foster such association must be made available wherever and whenever possible. The proper guidance of our children and youth is one of our paramount responsibilities. We are looking to those who represent the General Authorities in Priesthood and in Auxiliary work to discharge this responsibility in sincerity and prayerful devotion. Wherefore, now let every man learn his duty, and to act in the office in which he is appointed, in all diligence. He that is slothful shall not be counted worthy to stand, and he that learns not his duty and shows himself not approved shall not be counted worthy to stand. Even so. Amen. Sincerely your brethren, George Albert Smith J. Reuben Clark, Jr. David O. McKay The First Presidency Ward Relief Society Conferences, November 4, 1945 CONTINUING the plan first adopted in 1942 for auxiliaries to hold special meetings and annual conferences on Fast Sunday evenings, the Relief Society has again been assigned the evenings of Fast Day in November and March. Fast Day in November this year will occur November 4, and the General Board recommends that this evening be used for the annual ward Relief Society conference. Ward Relief Society presidents may therefore arrange with their respective bishops for holding meetings on the evening of Fast Day in November. This is a most favorable Sunday on which to hold the ward Relief Society conference, coming as it does only one month after the opening of the regular weekly meetings in October, thus affording opportunity for previewing the lessons and other work, near the beginning of the educational season. It is recommended: 1. That each ward conference be attended by a representative of the stake board who should be present at both the officers' meeting and the general session. 2. That each conference consist of  two meetings? a. An officers' meeting to be attended by the ward executive officers, special workers and class leaders, the ward bishop or his representative, and the visiting stake board member.
b. A general session for all Relief Society members and for the general membership of the ward.
The purposes of the officers' meeting are to discuss special problems confronting the ward Relief Society, and to provide opportunity for the stake board member to evaluate the condition of the ward Society and to advise, instruct, and stimulate the ward officers. In order to accomplish the purposes of the meeting, some stakes prepare a questionnaire or present and discuss data from the last annual report. At least one hour should be allowed for this meeting and, in some instances, a longer period may be required. The time for holding the officers' meeting is optional with wards, but should be at a time convenient for the visiting stake board member and bishop. For example, this meeting may be held immediately preceding the general session, as heretofore
suggested, the previous evening, or at some other time convenient for the bishop and visiting board member. This officers' meeting, held in connection with the ward conference, may constitute the monthly ward preparation meeting for the month in which the conference is held.
In order to insure a large attendance at the general session of the conference, it is recommended that advance announcement of the meeting be made in Relief Society and other ward gatherings. Relief Society members particularly should be urged to attend.
A suggestive program for use at ward conference will be sent to ward and stake presidents in bulletin form. Its use is optional and stakes and wards desiring to plan their own programs may do so. However, the General Board is very anxious that this meeting be used to acquaint ward members with the work of Relief Society and also with a view to enlisting the active participation of the women of the ward. TODAY Dorothy Mae Halls This moment was created for happiness. And now is the time to feel gay. If happiness be postponed till tomorrow. What shall I do with today? The breath of life must be breathed today, Or breathed it will never be; Tomorrow is always just out of my grasp, Today is confronting me. Beyond This Dorothy Clapp Rohinson THE car was cruising effortlessly. It was a rare morning and a rare scene. Peaks of mountains and barbs of lava etched jagged holes through a downy quilt of shifting rain clouds. The scent of wet earth and green sage crept through the open window. In the back seat Mary Evans quivered with nostalgia. "It's camouflage,? she whispered to herself. "Cruel, selfish camouflage." The desert stretched before them with blue mountains for a backdrop. The soft rain came, then passed and came again. Quiescent, the mood of the travelers softened. Only Mary stiffened. '*We should be home by five o'clock." Home. These carefree people, Mr. McCollum, his wife and daughter, Patricia, would be home. Mary no longer had a home. Home meant a family and love and dreams. It meant building for the future. Her future lay behind. A roaring filled the sky. Between cloud puffs three bombers appeared flying in formation. The car stopped while the driver watched. "That's the life," he sighed. "Those kids are lucky." "Lucky." Mary spat the word. The girl beside her laid a hand gently on her knee but Mary moved. The hand was withdrawn. To these people war meant honor and glory. It even made them kind to their seamstress. They had brought her on this trip thinking it would make her forget. As if there were such a thing as forgetting. A quick smothered sob made her turn quickly, but Patricia's face was turned away. Gene had been the son every mother thinks she has. Strong, rugged, yet as full of dreams as a girl. "Don't you worry. Mom," he had said so many times. "Some day people are going to point to you and say, 'Know what? That's Gene Evan's mother. And you will swell with pride and I will tell the whole world the kind of mother you have been. And I'll pay the mortgage and buy new furniture. How's that?" "Perfect." Mary never doubted he would do just that. Gene had what it took to make dreams come true. The bombers passed and the car started again. Mary stared unseeing at the rocks and brush. It was such a little way back to his boyhood. "Know what?" he had asked once in a burst of confidence. He had finished mowing McCollum's lawn and they were sitting on their own back steps. The softness of a spring evening filled the dusk about them. "No. What?" "Some day after I go away and make my fortune, I'll come winging back out of the clouds in a big shining ship. I'll set her down over there on that vacant lot and everybody will come running to see. Page  Pat will be there, too. I'll be big then and strong, and I will pick her up in my arms and while everybody is watching we will fly away into the? into the land of Shining Mountains. DREAMS. Sweet dreams of youth. Their ending was of the essence of their birth. He had gone winging into the Shining Mountains, but Patricia was here and all the dreams had been for nothing. Mary had tried desperately to make the years less hard. Her efforts had been but fumbling beside the directness of his purpose. He had grown tall, hard of muscle and keen of eye. Handsome fellow, people said, and drew their daughters away. He would be like his dad. Mary knew better. From first grade on he'd had eyes for one girl only, Patricia McCollum, the untouchable. But his pride was as fierce as his strength. Mary glanced briefly at the girl, then looked again. She was staring ahead, her face a study in alabaster, hands motionless in her lap. Compelled by Mary's gaze she turned. Her mind came back slowly from long distances. There was something baffling in her eyes. Was it pity. Mary would have no pity. For herself or Gene. Oh, especially not for Gene. How he had managed flying lessons she never knew. It seemed impossible to add one more hour to his day. But he had. Then those flying lessons had suddenly become the important thing in his life?in all life. At twenty-one he had put aside the dreams of youth for the grim business of war. Mary tried to shut her mind to that first parting. He had stood on the back porch a long time staring in the direction of the imposing McCollum home, but he left without going over. Patricia had come the next day and if her eyes were bleak with sympathy, well, Mary's were bleak, too. She was left with only memories. The car picked up speed. The landscape became wilder, more stark. Was it like this in Greenland, she wondered? He'd been there the last year. He had written so few details. Don't worry, Mom. Our huts are warm, and we can take it. I am getting a leave the next time we hit the mainland. I hope it will be soon. There is nothing in all the world like the feel of good old U. S. Soil under a punk's feet. Nothing unless it is the sight of his Mom or his best girl. I'll come winging out of the clouds as I promised. And I am getting Pat this trip. Do you think she will spare me a week? I have learned basic values up here, and I am going to tell her what I should have told her long ago. But he hadn't asked Patricia to spare a week from her busy comfortable life. He had never whispered the wild sweet love that had been his secret dream through the years. In quick thought Mary turned, and wondered at the nakedness of the girl's face. Why?why it hadn't been pity. Patricia had been in love with him. She would have gone winging with him into the unknown. That explained so many little things. Mary sickened a little. The knowledge would have meant so much to Gene. It would have meant fulfilment to him. Now he would never know?or had he known? Of course. That. Explained what he had said about basic values. Her lips set stubbornly. Patricia had never known want or an unfulfilled desire. Let her suffer as Gene had suffered. In all her life Mary had had just her son. She was not sharing him now.
She had worked night and day to prepare for his coming. Her few carefully hoarded dollars had gone for paint and wallpaper. The money he sent home she was saving for him. She had changed her bed to his room. Maybe he would not recognize it under its coat of paint. She wanted him to have the best of everything.
And then?and then the very day he was to have arrived there came a cablegram instead. "Lost in performance of duty." A month?a long, long month?during which Patricia had stood by, white-faced, tight-lipped. How blinded Mary had been by her own suffering. A moment ended by a letter. His plane had been found. He and all his crew had been buried at an advance base, whatever that meant.
Yes, after all Mary did know what it meant. It meant empty, desolate years. It meant the end of the world. It meant the end of planning?and that Patricia would never know.
The rain clouds lifted and the rocks grew hot. They stopped at the Craters of the Moon. It had been very kind of the McCollums to bring her on this trip but she wished they would not stop so often. She watched impatiently while the driver paid an entrance fee and received instructions. More impatiently she saw him turn the car onto a road where no road should ever be. It lead into lava flows once spewed white-hot from a dragon's
mouth. Immediately her impatience vanished. For the first time in months she was interested. The bleakness and blackness found echo in her heart.
Weird, uncanny formations, terrifying in their stark nakedness, were sharply etched, as yet untouched by the raging power of time and the elements. Rising from the confusion, were several sharply sloping cones of coal-black pulverized cinders.
Something was rising unbidden in Mary. Something akin to justification. How like LIFE this barren waste was, bleak, impotent and utterly without form or purpose. Of no earthly use to God or man.
They rounded a quick turn and stopped abruptly. Leaving the car they stood at the edge of the road gazing in awe and bewilderment.
HEAVEN had laid a fleece of beauty over stark sterility. Every slope of every black hill was covered with a carpet of flowers. Wild snowballs, Gene had called them. From between two slender silver leaves a stem rose, topped by a snowball the size of a large marble. The balls graduated in color from pale canary through orange, to crimson.
Unbelievably, there was a tiny orchard of these among them. A Heaven by Gardener not only had planted, but had spaced them. Looking from any direction there were perfect rows with plants four inches apart. Silver, yellow, orchid, crimson, and, underneath, the rimming black lace of cinders. It was a miracle. The ash of black despair had given birth to HOPE, beautiful beyond compare.
At Patricia's gasp, Mary turned to face her. Tears were streaming unheeded down the girl's cheeks. This was the girl Gene had loved, who loved him; and there must be no despair. Patricia's must not be denied her. Mary took the girl's hand. "He meant to tell you," she whispered. "That is why he was coming home."
