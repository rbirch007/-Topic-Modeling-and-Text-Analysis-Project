HOLLYHOCKS Delia Adams Leitnei Hollyhocks so prim and tall, All along my garden wall; Bright array of pink and white, Shades of red and yellow bright, Single, double, frilled and plain, Stately but without disdain; Such a regal air they bear. And their dignity they wear Kingly, but so graciously. They are the garden's royalty. PRESENCE Alice Money Bailey She is not gone. The rows of bottled fruit Arranged on cellar shelves still bear a mute But sharp reminder?berries, apples?keys To thrift. Her potted plants, her brooms, and these: The brightly colored rags she meant to braid. The handkerchiefs she ironed, her glasses laid With neat precision by her much-read book. No dim and fleeting wraith is hers. I look To see her laughter-crinkled face. I hear The briskness of her step, her accents clear. How can I feel the loss her absence gives. Or mourn for her whose vividness still lives? Page 556
