Settling Raymond, Alberta, Canada Jennie B. Knight Former Member Relief Society General Board RAYMOND is situated in Southern Alberta, Canada. It was founded by Jesse Knight of Utah, and named after his oldest son. It was built by pioneers who had faith in its future, and it took real pioneers with courage, thrift, good judgment, and faith to cope with problems that confronted the early settlers of that region. That they were victorious and are still a prudent, progressive, and religious people is shown in their beautiful modern homes and schools, churches and public buildings, their farms and ranches, factories, mills and elevators that today dot the land as far as the eyes can see. The name of Jesse Knight is so interwoven in the history of this commonwealth and the surrounding territory that it is fitting to relate how he came to be its founder. He was a man who had implicit confidence in the leaders of his Church. At the ushering in of the twentieth century, President Lorenzo Snow sent his New Year's greeting to the world. This message greatly impressed Brother Knight who at that time was receiving great wealth from his metal mines in Utah. In this message, he read: Men and women of wealth, use your riches to give employment to the laborer! Take the idle from the crowded centers of population and place them on the un-tilled areas that await the hand of industry. Page 524 Unlock your vaults, unloose your purses and embark in enterprises that will give work to the unemployed and relieve the wretchedness that leads to vice and crime around you. Make others happy and you will be happy yourselves. Many propositions had been made to Brother Knight to invest his money, but none appealed to him until he heard about Canada. However, Apostle John W. Taylor and Charles McCarthy of Alberta came to see him and told him of the fertile lands in Southern Alberta and urged him to buy some of the thousands of acres. The project impressed him. He could see the possibility of using his money to magnify his "stewardship,*' for it was only as a steward, he believed, that wealth came to him. In the spring of 1900, he sent his two sons, Oscar Raymond and Jesse William, to Canada to investigate the situation, the result being that they purchased 30,000 acres of land and set to work to stock it. Later, their father met them in Canada. The weather was ideal, the country beautiful and green. It looked like a real paradise to Jesse Knight. He was there only a few days before he had a clear idea of what he wanted to do. He would build a sugar factory that would give employment to Latter-day Saints and others who would come where they might secure land on easy terms and make homes for their children and themselves. On July 10, 1901, he purchased 226,000 acres of prairie land from the Canadian Northwest Irrigation Company and the Alberta Railroad and Irrigation Company through their agent, Hon. C. A. Magrath. SETTLING RAYMOND, ALBERTA, CANADA 525; THRESHING SCENE IN RAYMOND, CANADA, ON THE HEREFORD RANCH Yield, sixty bushels to the acre He signed a contract to build a sugar factory, and have it ready to handle the beet crop in 1903 and to keep it in operation for twelve years. This contract was guaranteed with a pledge of $50,000. Who but a man of faith could have made such an agreement in so short a time with nothing but a vast, grass-covered prairie surrounding this location? RAYMOND townsite was selected soon after the contract was signed, and on a bright Sunday afternoon, at the request of Presi-ident C. O. Card, friends from neighboring towns and ranches met to dedicate this townsite. There was not a tree, or even a tent to be seen as they stood on the buffalo-trodden soil to participate in the exercises. In the town charter, which was read. Brother Knight had insisted that it contain a forfeiture clause to the effect that if liquor, or gambling houses, or places of ill fame were established on the premises, the property holders would forfeit title to the land. The dedicatory prayer was offered by Apostle John W. Taylor. Songs of praise and thanksgiving filled the air and a feeling of welcome and good will was felt by all. The town of Raymond grew rapidly,, for in less than two years there were over fifteen hundred settled there. Most of them were young, including many college graduates. Buildings sprang up with mushroom rapidity, the blacksmith shop of Ephraim Hicks being the first to break the horizon. Many of the early homes were of the ?lean-to" type, just one room with a slanting roof to which other rooms were added later. A church with a heating plant was built by Jesse Knight. This and the school house were the first public buildings erected. Charles McCarthy and T. O. And Louis King were the first to build mercantile stores. B. F. Rolf son was a carpenter and his house was the first to be finished. HANNAH GIBBS, who planted the first tree, arrived on September 3, 1901, with her nine children. George Munn, William Lamb, and families came September 2d. They experienced real difficulty in pitching their tents, as there was a bleak blizzard when they emerged from the mixed freight and passenger train. A number of families lived in tents during the first winter. Water for culinary purposes was hauled in barrels from the canal until Ray Knight had it piped into the center of town, and from there it was still hauled to the homes in barrels on sleds. In winter, the water was always frozen in the barrels, and if one wished a drink he had to chop the ice and melt it. Hannah Gibbs became the community nurse and doctor. She had her first experience as midwife March 16, 1902, when the first boy, Raymond Holbrook, was born. This nurse, taught by experience and faith, brought numerous babies into the world. She nursed each mother and babe for ten days for which service she received five dollars. She never lost a case. Even after Dr. Rivers settled in Raymond she was still called in on many occasions. Jessie Nilsson, a girl, was the first child born in Raymond. In the spring of 1902, people came very fast by rail, or overland with teams and wagons, driving their cattle. This spring was very cold and stormy. During one of these bad storms forty-seven new settlers arrived. It was necessary to house them in the church for ten days while other shelters were being provided. Under the direction of the bishop and Relief Society, with the help of neighbors and friends, they enjoyed cooked meals. KNIGHT SUGAR FACTORY, RAYMOND, CANADA Building completed in 1903, and sugar was manufactured that same year SETTLING RAYMOND, ALBERTA, CANADA 527 THE RAYMOND RELIEF SOCIETY was organized in the lean-to in the back of this building, the home of Emma }. Bevan, February 1902. THE ward was organized on October 10, 1901, with Jesse W. Knight as bishop, and Joseph Bevan and Ephraim Hicks as counselors. Brother McCarthy notified the Bishop of this appointment while he and Mrs. Knight were "riding the range" on the "K-2" ranch, where they were then living. They moved to Raymond and built a home where young couples were married and many royal guests entertained, among them being President Joseph F. Smith and wife, President Francis M. Lyman, Dr. George H. Brimhall, L. H. Hol-brook, and their wives, some of the apostles and their wives, and other Church and government officials, as well as dear friends and associates. The first couple married by Bishop Knight was Katie Pitt and William Jensen of Salt Lake City. They were at the dedication of the townsite. All of the auxiliary organizations were fortunate in having efficient officers from the beginning. The Relief Society commenced its work early in 1902 under the direction of its president Emma J. Bevan, at whose home it was organized. With Counselors Mary J. Selman and Annie Gibbs, with teachers and members, this thrifty organization did a wonderful work, throughout the years it carried on the traditions of charity, love, and preparedness for which it was organized. The Relief Society erected a granary on its own city lot, which was filled with wheat. Later it owned a quarter section of land on which wheat was raised for the benefit of the Society. HOME OF JESSE WILLIAM KNIGHT First bishop of Raymond The year 1903 marked the completion of the sugar factory, the major activity in all that section of the country at that time. Words fail to express what a Herculean task it was to build and operate a sugar factory in so short a time. The land which was covered with tall grass and "a million mosquitoes to every blade" had to be prepared to raise beets for the factory. Men and boys who were not building were ploughing and cultivating the land. Warren Depew, a veteran plowman, reports that 3,000 acres were ready on scheduled time. It took the combined efforts of men. Women, and children, augmented by Indians, Chinese, and itinerant laborers to plant, thin, top, and harvest the beets, as well as 150 to 300 men to build and operate the factory. This enterprise was fortunate in the intelligent personnel of the men who supervised the work. Foremost among them was Ephraim P. Ellison, a man of acute understanding and executive ability-. His posterity-are still builders in the Alberta country. Brother J. William Evans, who remained loyal to Raymond to the end. Was the first supervisor of the beet fields and later held important positions in the factory. Along with all the work the women had to do, it fell to their lot to foster the social functions, as related before. The very first Christmas party was given in the meeting house. Sister Elizabeth King, who is still stake president of YW'MIA, and Sister Lamb decorated the building and the tree, and the appropriate program and dance of that date set a pace worthy to be followed. The pioneers who still remain are unanimous in the opinion expressed by Dr. George H. Brimhall, whose sons and daughters were among the first settlers, that: God from on high lights up the way For man to go that's best, He pro\ides the opportunity, But man must do the rest.
