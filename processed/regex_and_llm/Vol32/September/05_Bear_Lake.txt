BEAR LAKE Luella Nebeker Adams In a quiet, secluded valley Surrounded by the mountains high, Rests a jeweled lake of sapphire Blending into azure sky. Soul-inspiring in its beauty, Changing in its mood and hue From soft tones of gray and silver To clearest shades of brilliant blue; Mirroring the day's first sunbeams, Shining down in glorious light; Rays are turned to water prisms. Multicolored, diamond bright. Afternoon?clouds bank about it, North winds blow, and billows roar, Wild waves chase each other, playing, As they race to reach the shore. Retreating day?the sun descends? Lavish color in the west; Across the lake the setting sun. In brilliance, sinks to rest. Peace and quiet steal o'er the valley. Placid, calm the lake, and clear; The evening star keeps watch, reminding That the Infinite is near. The Cover: "Fruited Bough" from a photograph by T. J. Howells, M. D.
