Sixty Years Ago Excerpts from the Woman's Exponents, April 1, and April 15, 1885 "For the Rights of the Women of Zion and the Rights of the Women of All Nations" Editorial Notes: The General Conference of the Church will be held this year in Logan, instead of Salt Lake City. This is the second time only that the General Conference has not convened here. The other instance was in St. George in April 1877. Correspondence: Nutrioso, Arizona, Feb. 13, 1885, Editor Exponent ? Thinking perhaps a few words from far away might be interesting is why I write. We left St. George the last of June 1883, and after an agreeable visit to Panguitch Lake and various settlements we returned to St. George to the fall conference and soon after bade adieu to our much cherished home, and the Temple and its pleasant associations. We had a very prosperous journey of 500 miles through an indescribable wilderness of sterile barrenness, and came to this place in good health and spirits, although tired, worn and weary. We here found most of our family in peace, comfort and reasonably prosperous in the midst of the saints. This is a pleasant, fertile, but small, valley, truly in the tops of the mountains, with beautiful scenery of low hills and openings of timber for farms, with the necessary water, this being a rainy climate. We have here the best built and finest little town in Arizona; the dwellings of frame painted white, with good, substantial frame barns and outhouses; a cooperative store in healthy and prosperous condition. We have a good frame meeting house, also white, which is also our school house. Our meetings are well attended, also our day and Sunday schools, not forgetting the prosperous condition of our Primary and Relief Society. The Brown brothers have a steam saw mill in successful operation, to whose enterprise and energy much of the prosperity of this little town is to be credited. Yours respectfully, T. C. @ RRA Letter from a Gentile, Mrs. Wells: I take several papers, but none that I read with more interest than the Exponent. 1 am watching with great interest your people struggling for existence, surrounded by enemies as they are, and what the result will be I cannot yet tell; but my opinion is that riches and selfishness will be the greatest enemies your people will have to contend with. This was the great moral disease that Jesus Christ found in the world and prescribed for; and so long as your people follow His directions closely and attentively they will live and grow and prosper; but when riches, pride and selfishness grow up among you, then you will have only a form of godliness without its power, as the religious orders of this country, and the spirit of the world in all of them and the spirit of Christ not found in them.?John M. Russel. RELIEF SOCIETY REPORTS Fremont, Piute Co., Editor Exponent ?
