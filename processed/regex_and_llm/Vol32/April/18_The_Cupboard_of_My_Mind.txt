THE CUPBOARD OF MY MIND Ann Young Hughes My thoughts are pretty dishes. This rare old china platter The cupboard is my mind, I fill with gems, and song. Where cups are filled with wishes And these I daily scatter Of almost every kind. To help some soul along. The saucer thoughts are shallow-I throw them all away For lovely bowls that hallow My heartfelt thoughts today. This urn of pain, not pleasure, Is cherished fragile ware That holds my rarest treasure? The thoughts of friends who care.
