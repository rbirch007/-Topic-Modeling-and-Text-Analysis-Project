THIS, TOO, SHALL PASS AWAY" Alice Whitson Norton No silver lining can I see behind the clouds to-day. That fall so uninvited on my head; So hopeless is the heart within the breast of me, Because a long, sweet, cherished dream is dead. Numbed by the constant agony of pain, my soul Is like a bier bereft of flowers bright; My thoughts?as motionless as some deep frozen pool And desolate as any unstarred night. And yet I know tomorrow's sun will rise and set, Just as it's done since God created day. And in its warmth I'll find myself remembering With gratitude, "This, too, shall pass away." And then I'll ponder in my heart: "Why did I grope In darkness, thus belittling, the silver gleam of hope?"
