NOTES FROM THE FIELD Vera White Pohlman' General Secretary-Treasurer Regulations governing the submittal of material for "Notes from the Field" appear in the Magazine for February 1944, page 104. SPECIAL ACTIVITIES A Seminary Relief Society RAY L. JONES, principal of the Midway L. D. S. Seminary at Lewisville, Idaho, is giving seminary students an insight into the operation of Church auxiliaries by organizing the students into groups patterned after the auxiliaries. His account of the sample Relief Society in the seminary during the 1943-44 school year states: "The organization has consisted of three girls?a president chosen from the Church history class, a first counselor from the New Testament class, and a second counselor from the Old Testament class. The purpose of this organization has been threefold: 1. To acquaint all seminary students with the purpose and value of the Relief Society; 2. To give students opportunities to serve their fellow classmates; 3. To train student officers for future leadership in the Relief Societies of their wards and stakes. "The principal project carried out by this organization during the past year has been the writing of letters to the servicemen from the five wards of the school district. These letters have included the following features: 1. A mimeographed letter from the Relief Society officers; 2. News from the high school, home wards, and from the boys in the service; 3. A message from the stake presidency, ward bishopric, and the high school principal; 4. Personal notes written on the back and margins of the mimeographed letter by seminary students. "The first letter was mailed, in November (1943), to 150 servicemen, the second, in February, to more than 200, and the third letter, in May. Dozens of letters have been received from the servicemen expressing their appreciation for being remembered. These replies have come from all parts of the United States and from the battle fronts of the world, including India, North Africa, Italy, England, the Aleutians, and the South Pacific. The student Relief Society officers have organized and supervised all phases of this letter-writing project, and in addition have carried out the following activities: 1. Sent get-well cards to students who have been absent because of sickness; 2. Sent sympathy cards to students who have had a death in the family; 3. Written or visited sick students in hospitals; 4. Suggested and assisted in making beautification improvements in the seminary building; 5. Regularly cared for the potted plants, goldfish, et cetera; Page  Presidency of the sample Relief Society of the Midway L. D. S.

Assisted in the seminary graduation by arranging flowers for decorating the chapel, assisting the girls with corsages, et cetera." Juarez Stake (Mexico) "NELLIE S. HATCH, president of Juarez Stake Relief Society, wrote in 1944: "Our Mexican Branch in Colonia Dublan, a Spanish-speaking organization consisting of forty-two members, takes several Magazine subscriptions, an indication of the progress these sisters are making in learning the English language. The Mexican Branch has found other ways also of demonstrating its interest in Relief Society work, and of extending and increasing its usefulness and spirit of charity. When a young woman was left a widow with six small children, they drew from a fund that had been accumulating, and acting with and under the direction of the bishop, the woman was placed in a home where she could care for her small children, work was found for the oldest girl, to supplement what the mother earns by taking work into the home, and a simple but secure living was thus provided for one who had been unfortunate and dependent. 'The Pacheco Ward, a small and isolated community in the mountains, has also been diligent and forward looking. A few years ago it began accumulating material that would be needed in times of emergency and stress, and to create this initial fund each sister donated to the Society one hectoliter of com (approximately one bushel). Some of the husbands caught the spirit and added to this. The aggregate donation amounted to 50 hectoliters of corn which was stored until planting time. Each year some of the seed was planted, but always a sufficient amount was reserved for food, in case the need arose, and was not sold or rented out for planting until another crop was secure. But the annual turnover and increase of this basic donation has netted the Society each year a fair profit which has been converted into staple articles; such as cloth, thread, salt, soda, medicines, et cetera, until, at the end of 1943, there was an estimated value of merchandise on hand of $1,525, and of medicines to the value of $115,000, all of which is held for times of emergency. NOTES FROM THE FIELD 951 These three women are sisters, and at the time this picture was submitted, last August, all three were serving as ward Relief Society presidents. They are: Viola P. Zwahlen, then president (but since released) of Bountiful Second Ward Relief Society, South Davis Stake, and formerly president of the Castle Dale Ward Relief Society, Emery Stake; Dora P. Ellis, president of the Ellensburg (Washington) Branch Relief Society, Northwestern States Mission, and formerly of the Wellington Ward Relief Society, Carbon Stake; and Adrian P. Hanson, then president (but since released) of Delta Second Ward Relief Society, Deseret Stake. Picture submitted by Leola Jensen of Perron (Emery Stake), Utah. "In addition to this the members have on hand a ton of potatoes for sale, the growing of which was done through a project they instigated and with which the entire community helped. One hundred kilos of seed potatoes were donated to them by an interested and enthusiastic potato farmer who not only gave them the seed but planted them, cared for them during the summer as well, and turned them over to them in the fall with their increased supply. All but what was needed for food was saved for seed and planted in the spring of 1943. To take care of the planting as well as the harvesting, a town work-day was called and all turned out, and the Relief Society served dinners for them on both occasions. Again the potatoes not actually needed for food were saved for seed, and money raised in this way is continuing to add to the fund already started." Big Horn Stake (Wyoming) OULDA M. LYNN, Big Horn Stake Relief Society president, sent to the General Board one of the attractive wall calendars distributed by the Lovell West Ward Relief Society to all women of the ward. Printed in brown on buff paper, each leaf of the calendar is headed "Lovell West Ward Relief Society" with an accompanying statement in red: "Relief Society is an Open Door to Enlightened, Ennobled Living." The Tuesdays on this calendar have no dates, but instead, printed in red, are the Relief Society meeting days, the first Tuesday iridicated by "Theology"; the second, "Work"; the third, "Literature"; and the fourth, "Social Science". The fifth Tuesday in January is designated "Special Program"; the fifth Tuesday in May, "Closing Social"; and the fifth Tuesday in October, "Special Work Day". During the four summer months, only the monthly work meeting on the second Tuesday is indicated in red, accompanied by the words "Visiting Teacher" inasmuch as during these months no training-report meetings are held on the first Tuesday, but reports are made on the second Tuesday. Tableau staged for the ward homecoming, September 12, 1944, by the Relief Society of the Boise (Idaho) Second Ward, depicting the many activities in which the Society participates. On a backdrop of blue satin the Society's motto "Charity Never Faileth" was lettered in gold. Grouped on either side of the stage were the Singing Mothers led by Gladys Broadbent and accompanied by Verda Peterson. Welfare work and sewing was represented by Counselor Gladys Cain, Mabel Sorenson and Belle Borup; Eva Robison and Mildred Kane were in the white uniforms of the Red Cross surgical dressings division; Edythe Mathews and Counselor Mary E. Lund represented the Red Cross canteen corps. Magazine representative, Irene Read, was ready with receipt book to take a subscription for TheSecretary Elizabeth Nokelby was writing the minutes and President Suza P. Nielson was seated at her desk presiding over the activities. Across the front of the stage a bright border of cans brought to mind the summer canning project and gave those who participated the satisfaction of time well spent. "Opening Social" is the red-letter day on the last Tuesday of September, and a "Bazaar" in capital letters is scheduled for the second Tuesday in December. The final red-letter Tuesday of the year is "Christmas". Lovell West Ward is commended for its enterprising use of this means of keeping Relief Society constantly before the women of the ward, which should result in increased attendance not only because the members themselves can better plan their work and appointments so as not to conflict with Relief Society meetings and socials, but because the Society also had to plan its work systematically for the entire year before the calendar could be printed. This calendar on the wall serves not only as a constant reminder but as a standing invitation to Relief Society. Sofe Johnson is president of this ward Relief Society.

Hod "THE WAYS OF HER HOUSEHOLD" Prov. 31:27 Delia Adams Leitner "She looks well to the ways of her household," How often in days fraught with care These words have brought to me comfort And helped me to cheerfully bear The demands and the duties so endless. Interruptions and problems to meet. Exactions in "ways of the household," And each day of the year they repeat. But I, with all true-hearted mothers. Am glad in this way I can share The work and the joy of creation By love and by service and prayer. We think not of tasks as a burden. Believing our Lord has designed No higher and finer a mission Than these "households" to women assigned.
