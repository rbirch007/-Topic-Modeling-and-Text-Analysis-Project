DR. ERNEST A. HOOTON, anthropologist of Harvard University, hopes that a woman will some day be president of the United States. He feels that women's innate honesty makes them better statesmen than men are. In 1884, and again in 1888, a woman (Belva Lockwood), was nominated for the presidency of the country. WINGS AROUND SOUTH  AMERICA, by Alice Dalgleish, is a charmingly told narrative of travel in our neighboring continent. Page 413 EDITORIAL
