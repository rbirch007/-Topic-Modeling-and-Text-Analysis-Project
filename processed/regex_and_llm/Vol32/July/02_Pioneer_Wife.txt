And For Eternity Olive Woolley Burt CHAPTER II Synopsis Delsa Marriott receives a letter from her fiance, Hugh Temple, with the army in Australia, asking her to release him from their engagement so that he can marry an Australian girl. Delsa is broken-hearted, and because her family and friends have long looked forward to this marriage, she hesitates to tell them that she has been jilted, and decides to keep this a secret until she can make up her mind whether or not to release Hugh. DELSA took especial pains with her looks the next morning. The little children had such sharp eyes, such inquisitive minds, such uninhibited interest in their teacher. Likely as not Rickey Graham would look at her sharply and say, "You been cryin', teacher? You tell me what's wrong and I'll fix it!" Ricky was genuinely fond of her. And there was Jeff Holden, his gray eyes kindly penetrating. She didn't want any questions, even unasked ones. During the night Delsa had made up her mind to one thing: she would not write to Hugh immediately. She would wait a little, think the matter over before she told him he was free. For she had thought of their engagement as he had done?as something as binding as a marriage vow. She had not gone out once, not even to a town dance, with anyone since Hugh left. She hadn't even thought of any other boy. Page 420 Now, by Hugh's own word, she was free to think, to look at others. Maybe she would find that she, too, had been blinded by their childhood friendship; maybe she would find that other men existed in this world. But whether she did or not, she would at least give herself time to think of a way to break the news to her family and friends; and she would give Hugh time to realize what he was doing?to realize that his letter had been a devastating thing to her?not a question to be decided lightly. "But of course," Delsa whispered into her mirror, "of course, Delsa, you can't keep him if he wants to be free. But maybe he doesn't. Maybe, if I play for time, he'll come back to his senses, his honest, smalltown senses, and to me!" Careful as she had tried to be, Delsa had evidently not succeeded in making herself look gay and carefree. She knew this by the anxious look her mother gave her when she came into the big kitchen for breakfast?a searching look, followed by bright, casual remarks, with no reference to last night. The oatmeal was bubbling in its kettle on the stove, and her mother served her a bowl full of the steaming goodness. She poured over it the thick, yellow pan cream, saying, "You're lucky, Delsa. You can eat all the cream and mush you want and not put on an ounce. It's using your brain does it, I always say. If we older women would just use our minds the way we did when we were young?"
"Now, Mom!" Delsa smiled, "maybe it isn't that. Maybe it just takes oatmeal and cream a long time to work. These breakfasts will be showing on my hips some day?"Don't you get to thinking that, Delsa. You need good food, the way you work and struggle with those kids. You eat that mush now."
But the mush didn't look good any longer. Not that she was worried about getting fat?not any more. What difference would it make? She would still be Miss Delsa, the school teacher, and her pupils wouldn't notice the gradually accumulating heaviness and slowness and dullness.
She threw a soft knit scarf over her light curls and went out into the March morning. She didn't look again into the mirror or she would have seen that the robin's egg blue of the scarf had deepened the blue of her eyes?and had deepened, also, the shadows that lay like pale wings below them.
The children ran to meet her, shrieking with joy, holding before them the bright paper pinwheels she had let them make yesterday. She laughed back at them, thinking what a pretty picture they made, running along the country road in the March wind with the red and yellow and green bits of paper whirling in front of them. Maybe, if she were an artist or a poet, she could catch this innocent gaiety and keep it, to remember that she, too, had once run free and gay with the wind and yellow pinwheels.
JEFF HOLDEN was on the hill back of the school building with the eighth grade boys, flying kites. Jeff was principal of the two-roomed school, and teacher of the upper four grades. He was also scoutmaster, crafts instructor and friend of the adolescent boys, who were feeling the hardness of the war, too, since their older brothers and neighbors?their heroes and companions and instructors in normal times?had been called away.
Jeff saw Delsa and, waving at her, shouted, "Not nine yet!"
She nodded and cried against the wind, "Nearly!"
Jeff came running down the hill, lightly and easily in spite of his twenty-six years. His dark hair was rumpled by the wind and he was laughing, but his eyes, amazingly gray in his tanned face, were tired and serious. He looked at Delsa and said, lightly, "That letter from Hugh?he's all right, I take it?"
Delsa smiled, "Hugh's letters should be posted in the post office for all to read," she began, and then caught her words back, remembering what Hugh had written.
"All the boys' letters should, I maintain!" Jeff agreed gaily, apparently not noticing the break in Delsa's sentence. "In a town this size, where every boy is sort of neighbor-hood property, the letters from all parts of the world sort of belong to us all, don't you think?"
"Well, the town does hear most of them," Delsa defended, "They're read in Church?all that are proper to be read. Even in a town like this, the boys ought to be allowed to write some private news?"
"Jeff laughed. "Grand!" He looked at his watch, whistled sharply. Henry Lake ran into the school building and brought out the big, old-fashioned bell and began to ring it with all his might. The children trooped down from the hillside, in from the road. Delsa went inside, sat down at the piano in the "big room," and began to play a march. The pupils filed in, sedate and orderly in contrast to their actions outdoors. Going to her own room, she passed Jeff in the tiny hall that ran between the two classrooms. She paused a moment. ?You look tired, Jeff," she said, "Anything wrong at home?" He smiled at her. "Trudy was sick last night," he explained. "I don't know what is wrong with her all the time. Mrs. Reeder seems to know about babies and Davy's okay. But Trudy gets thinner and thinner." ?I?ll run over after school," Delsa promised. "I'm no child expert, but maybe I can discover what's wrong. I don't think Mrs. Reeder's too bright, anyway, with babies." "Now I have something else to think of," Delsa thought with relief. "Poor little Trudy!" And poor Jeff! Struggling as he was with two children and a housekeeper who was neither smart nor very conscientious. It wouldn't have been so bad before the war. If Jeff's wife, Lucy, had died in normal times, there would have been a dozen capable women in the town ready to help him out with his babies and his house. But now they had all gone to work at the phosphate plant in the next valley. A big bus picked them up every morning and brought them home every night ?good wages and clean work, different from the familiar drudgery of housekeeping. You couldn't blame them for taking the jobs, drawing the good pay, especially when they felt that they were helping win the war, too. Jeff's problem was a minor one in their opinion. Only Mrs. Reeder was left to help him, Mrs. Reeder, who had proved too inept for a job at the plant. But Jeff made the best of it, running his household with one hand while he managed the school with the other. Delsa knew that Jeff had been deferred officially on account of his farm, which was large enough and important enough to win him exemption. But he was doing an even more essential work in the school, and for less pay. The woman who had been principal had left to take a job in a war plant at more than twice her teacher's salary. The big boys had been getting obstreperous; the larger girls becoming a problem ?adolescents with the maturity of country children and the freedom and intimacy of a small town and a lack of supervision due to their disrupted home lives. So Jeff had stepped in and taken over the school and the whole town had felt the benefit?and would feel it for a generation or more, Delsa admitted to herself. But few of the townspeople seemed to realize what Jeff was doing. Oh, some of them reached out a friendly hand when they had time, but for the most part he was limping along practically unaided. Delsa decided to take more time from her own problems and her own activities to take a look at Trudy now and then. SHE was shocked when she entered Jeff's little house. Lucy had always kept it so sparkling and bright that Delsa had thought of it as a doll's house. Now the doll's house was in disorder?and dirty. Windows were unwashed, curtains hung limp. In a soiled bed Trudy lay whimpering. Mrs. Reeder was rocking and reading.
"Don't do no good to pick her up, Delsa," Mrs. Reeder complained. "She just likes to bawl, seems like."
"She's wet and cold," Delsa said sharply. "Where's Davy?"
"Outside." Mrs. Reeder wasn't bothered by Delsa's implied criticism. "He won't stay indoors, even if he has a cold."
"Call him in," Delsa ordered. She put a kettle of water on the stove, where the fire was burning brightly enough to keep Mrs. Reeder comfortable, and picked up Trudy. Anger surged through her at sight of the little girl. She was almost a year old?should have been rosy-poly and smiling and rosy, but she was thin and whining. What was the town thinking of to let a lovely baby like this?Jeff's and Lucy's baby?get into this shape? What ails, when Jeff stepped into the had she herself been thinking?
Delsa shrugged. She had been working on her trousseau. Every afternoon and evening, sewing, crocheting, making things for her's and Hugh's comfort and pleasure. The other women had been at their own personal activities, too. They were all to blame, she, perhaps, more than the rest. Why hadn't Jeff complained? Why hadn't he shaken some sense into her?
Davy came in, his muddy shoes making tracks across the dirty floor.
Delsa put Trudy in the big kitchen rocking chair, so that Mrs. Reeder would not have a place to sit, and said, "You watch her, Davy."
She set Mrs. Reeder to scrubbing the kitchen floor while she unmade Trudy's bed, hung the blankets and mattress on the line in the clean March wind, and hunted about for clean sheets and pillow case and clothing for the baby.
When Trudy was bathed and warm and cooing with satisfaction, Delsa set her in her crib and started on Davy. He was a sturdy little fellow, evidently able to get the things he needed in spite of Mrs. Reeder's indolence. But he reveled in the attention, so the soapy bath, Delsa had then to curl under her brisk toweling, felt it looked exactly like his father's.
Jeff came in and whistled when he saw the activity. As teacher of the "big room" and principal, he hadn't been able to leave as early as Delsa had?he generally was at the building till nearly five?so the floor was scrubbed, Trudy was gurgling and Davey was laughing, rosy and clean in his faded blue coveralls, when Jeff stepped into the room.
He smiled at Delsa, and there was more than appreciation in that smile.
"Wonder woman!" he grinned, and went on gaily, "'And the touch of her deft fingers turned a shack into a home,' unquote."
Delsa smiled back, but a little grimly.
"You've got to put your foot down with Mrs. Reeder," she said firmly. "She must just sit here all day long and let these babies take care of themselves. Davy, bless his heart, is a capable little fellow, and hasn't suffered too much. But Trudy is going to be ill, Jeff, really ill, unless she gets proper care." "I've been afraid of it," he said wearily, "but what can I do? I do bathe them and feed them at night, but I just don't have time in the mornings. There are the chores to do-" "Aren't there any of the older boys that could help with those?" Delsa asked. Jeff shook his head. "They've all got more to do than they can manage. Why, that little romp on the hill this morning?fifteen minutes, all told, will have to be paid for by everyone of us with extra work tonight." He walked into the bedroom and picked up Trudy and held her close, rubbing his cheek against the soft down of her hair. "Daddy's girl!" he whispered. "Daddy's girl can take it, even if she shouldn't be asked to. And he'll make it up to her some day, Trudy. That's a promise." Delsa felt the tears, sudden and sharp, behind her lashes. "Jeff,? she said seriously, "it's all right to promise, but you can't keep that promise, you know. You can't ever make up to a baby for lack of care in its first few years. It's now or never," He sighed, "Then it'll have to be never, Trudy baby, because it simply can't be now. I can't do any more." Delsa replied, "Look, Jeff. If you won't think I'm butting in where I have no right to be, I'll run over here for a half hour before school every morning and drop in again at night. I can tell Mrs. Reeder exactly what to do and see that she does it. If she thinks any one is checking on her, she'll probably work all right. Would you mind?" "Would I mind? She asks," Jeff said with wonder in his voice. "It's a deal, then," Delsa said briskly. "Now get your clothes changed and get those chores done. Mrs. Reeder will have your supper ready soon. I'll feed Trudy and then you'll be all right for tonight." Jeff handed her the baby and Delsa began to feed her hot oatmeal with whole milk and sugar. Trudy ate it greedily, making little hungry sounds as she mouthed the rich, warm food. Jeff, in his overalls now, came and stood in the doorway, watching them. "I've never seen her eat like that," he said. "She's a funny little chick," Delsa said, holding the warm body closer to her, "She wants love and cuddling, Jeff, more than most babies do. She just has to have it?" Delsa stopped, suddenly remembering that Trudy had been robbed of her natural source of comfort and love. And not only Trudy, but Davy and Jeff, too. Delsa glanced up at Jeff, and her heart constricted. Hugh! Hugh! She thought, why can't it be you leaning there in the doorway, watching? Why must I, too, be robbed of my love? She bent her head low over Trudy to hide her tears from Jeff. He turned slowly and went outside, and Delsa held the baby close, close for a moment. "That is what I've wanted all the {Continued on page 447) LESSON DEPARTMENT Suggestions and Instructions on the Educational program COURSES for the coming educational year 1945-46, October through May, are as follows: Theology ? Church History (Continued). Visiting Teachers' Messages ? Sources of Strength: Charity. Literature ? The Bible in Our Literature. Social Science ? Modern Applications of Moral Principles (Continued). Again, as was the case for the educational year 1944-45, there are no special lessons outlined for use by the missions, since it is felt that all the lessons are suitable for use in the missions either as they are written or with slight adaptations. Moreover, according to present Church procedure in regard to lesson material taught by any auxiliary, all lessons to be taught must be approved by the Church Publications Committee through the General Board. This, therefore, renders it improper for missions or stakes to substitute lessons of their own choosing in place of the theology, visiting teachers' messages, literature or social science lessons which appear in Theand have been approved. The Goal of Relief Society Teaching Depending upon the skill of the teacher, many and varied methods of conducting a class period may be followed. All Relief Society teachers are not equally trained in teaching and many fine teachers have not had professional training. The best teachers, however, are always eager to improve their methods and make more effective their teaching. It is of paramount importance, however highly skilled a teacher may be, that she teach in the spirit of the gospel and give prayerful and conscientious study to her lessons. In addition, however, to the preparation of the lesson by a teacher, she should present it in such a way as to awaken in the members of her class a wish to study and gain knowledge for themselves. This desired end may be obtained by a variety of methods?by class participation either by an informal discussion, questions and answers, or by a more formal presentation such as a round table, panel discussion, etc., or by home study on the part of individual members. Whatever the means employed by the class leader, the result will be good teaching if both she and the Relief Society class members add to and increase their knowledge and strengthen their testimonies. Page  The lessons in the Social Science course for 1945-1946 "Modern Applications of Moral Principles" are to be taught in the light of revealed truth, as these principles have been set forth in gospel teachings. Special attention should therefore be given to the use of the references to Church literature found at the end of each lesson. In all Relief Society lessons the material taught must conform strictly to Church doctrine and belief. It is a great responsibility to undertake to teach a group of fellow Relief Society women. It is also a great privilege. From the hours of intensive study spent in preparation for each Relief Society lesson by a class leader come intellectual growth and a greater understanding of the gospel. May each class leader in the coming season do her utmost to impart knowledge to her class members and also awaken in them a desire to study and learn for themselves so that the testimonies of all Relief Society members may be strengthened. While lesson titles and lesson anus for each of the courses of study for the ensuing year are given in the previews, these are subject to change. Correspondence on Lessons Ward class leaders who desire help on any matter pertaining to a lesson should consult their stake leaders. Stake leaders desiring information may address such correspondence to General Board of Relief Society, Salt Lake City 1, Utah. It is not desirable to address communications either to the authors of the lessons or to any other Church office. Textbooks and Special References Textbooks should be supplied for the use of the respective class leaders from the funds of the Society. On the completion of the course the books should be returned to the Society for inclusion in the Relief Society library. If the special references are Church books, it may be desirable to purchase one or two for present and future availability. However, if the books do not hold lasting interest, it will be better to use library copies rather than to purchase books which will have only slight use. Behold, hath the Lord commanded any that they should not partake of his goodness? Behold I say unto you, Nay; but all men are privileged the one like unto the other, and none are forbidden (II Nephi 26:28). LESSON DEPARTMENT 427 Theology Church History Dr. H. Wayne Diiggs Preview of Lessons for 1945-1946 A preview of the second year's course of study entitled "Church History" introduces the lessons for 1945-46. Titles for the next eight lessons and their objectives follow below. It will be remembered that the central theme for the course is to be found in the Savior's words "By their fruits ye shall know them." Again we shall look at the fruits of Mormonism and find them good. By way of review we may summarize the three parts of the course once more. Part I for 1944-45 was devoted to the opening dispensation of the fullness of times and had as its objective the mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the coming of the "church out of the wilderness"; Part I for 1945-46 outlines the story of the saints in their movement to "the place which God prepared" in the tops of the everlasting mountains; Part III for 1946-47 pertains to the coming-of-age period of the Church with its broadened activities meeting the swift sweep of our modern times. The main objective of the course is to narrate the more important events of Church history and to consider the revelations in their relation to the historical episodes. We revere the revelations contained in the book of the Doctrine and Covenants as the revealed word of God for our day. The titles of the eight lessons for this year's course follow: 9. The Martyrdom oi Joseph Smith Objective: To indicate the worth of a great testimony and its supreme value to the onward development of the Church. 10. Brigham Young's CaJ] to Leadership Objective: To show the power of leadership under God. 11. The Journey Westward Objective: To trace the march of the saints westward and to show that physical hardships can more easily be endured by those who are supported by the spirit of the Lord than by those who are without his spirit. 12. Building an Empire in the West Objective: To indicate the beginning fulfillment of prophecy concerning the gathering of Israel. 13. Stakes oi Zion Increased Objective: To suggest the firm and sure way the Lord has of extending his purposes in the earth. 14. The Missionary System Broadened Objective: To develop the truth that the gospel is ours, but we must strive to share it with others. 15. The United Order Begun Objective: To show how the Lord strives always to have his children seek the more perfect social order of living. 16. The Building oi Temples Continues Objective: To show that God provides for the fulfillment of all his promises. In this second series of Church history lessons there will be need for the use of a book on Church history in addition to the Doctrine and Covenants which again is to be the text for the year. The book Essentials in Church History by Elder Joseph Fielding Smith, published in 1942 by the Deseret News Press, Salt Lake City, Utah, is recommended. While the lessons, it is hoped, will set the central objective for each month for the reading and discussion period, yet these necessarily short bits of writing covering but briefly the far-reaching episodes of our history, will need additional source material to enrich the story of our Church and its revealed doctrine. Essentials in Church History can provide such an enlargement of the theme. Do not lose track of the place of the Doctrine and Covenants in this study. Here, the words you will read are the words of the Lord which ever illuminate the enduring principles of life. Through all the study let us not forget our repeating phrase from lesson to lesson?we must "give heed unto his word" which has been written especially for us in this day. As to the method of class discussion, bear the following in mind: Somehow in too many lessons practically all of the material is given in the written lesson itself. The teacher covers this part fairly well. When, however, she reaches the discussion period, she poses questions that draw a weak response. To this she must then supplement her own contribution. In overcoming such difficulty there is the necessity of putting real content into the discussion period. In the case of the present series, this is done by directing class members to the words of the Lord as recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants. Once a class, after attempting to answer a simple but searching question, is turned to the clear and convincing facts as phrased by the Master, hearts are warmed; and minds, seeking ready confirmation of truth, recall personal illustrations which press for expression. Testimonies result, and the teacher assumes her rightful role as director, rather than taskmaster of the hour. Text and References Doctrine and Covenants. Price $1.00.

Lesson 9-The Martyrdom of Joseph Smith For Tuesday, October 2, 1945 Objective: To indicate the worth of a great testimony and its supreme value to the onward development of the Church. JOSEPH SMITH, prophet of the * nineteenth century, stood one January day in the year 1844 to address the newly appointed officers of peace for the city of Nauvoo. As mayor of the city he spoke, and within his voice was heard the prophetic tone of impending danger for himself and people. Some thirteen years had passed since the ?little flock" who first believed this modern seer had gathered at the home of Peter Whitmer that April day in 1830 to organize the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. And what bright yet bitter years these had been! Half a continent had been spanned in the march of missionary endeavor. Yes, even the Old World, too, had heard the elders sent by express command of a latter-day prophet. Now around him thousands of saints had gathered, and had builded Nauvoo, the most beautiful of cities then to be found on the rich and fertile soil of Illinois. Could it be that the time had truly come when Zion was to rejoice and but hold in memory those trying days of Kirtland and Independence? His words on this January day seemed not to indicate this for he said:... I am exposed to far greater danger from traitors among ourselves than from enemies without, although my life has been sought for many years by the civil and military authorities, priests, and people of Missouri; and if I can escape from the ungrateful treachery of assassins, I can live as Caesar might have lived, were it not for a right-hand Brutus. I have had pretended friends betray me. All the enemies upon the face of the earth may roar and exert all their power to bring about my death, but they can accomplish nothing, unless some who are among us and enjoy our society, have been with us in our councils, participated in our confidence, taken us by the hand, called us brother, saluted us with a kiss, join with our enemies, turn our virtues into faults, and, by falsehood and deceit, stir up their wrath and indignation against us, and. Bring their united vengeance upon our heads. All the hue-and-cry of the chief priests and elders against the Savior, could not bring down the wrath of the Jewish nation upon His head, and thereby cause the crucifixion of the Son of God, until Judas said unto them, "Whomsoever I shall kiss, he is the man; hold him fast.? Judas was one of the Twelve Apostles, even their treasurer, and dipt with their Master in the dish, and through his treachery, the crucifixion was brought about; and we have a Judas in our midst. (Essentials in Church History, pp. 360-361; D. H. C. Vol. VI, p. 152) What group of traitors from within would now essay the role of Judas and, pincer-like, provide the other prong of opposition to join with those mobocrats, from without to encircle and destroy the Prophet and his work? Somehow the storm of hate which ten years before had set the cry in Missouri, "the Mormons must go," now insidiously smoldered within the very councils of the Church. William Law, the Prophet's second counselor, together with his brother Wilson, William Marks, Leonard Soby, Robert Foster and others took offense at their leader's words and pulled away into a council of apostates who were secretly to pledge themselves to destroy Joseph Smith and his party; in fact, it was later discovered that William Law was in league with the Missourians who ever since the escape of the Prophet from their State had vowed to reach across the border line of Illinois and claim their man.
Realizing the price God had set upon the strength of a testament, (Hebrews 9:16-17), Joseph Smith repeatedly forewarned his followers of his coming death, first by visioning the ultimate need of a land beyond the rim of the great western mountains to which the saints might press for safety; and second, through his frequent words concerning the threats upon his own life. At a conference in October of 1843 he said, "This generation is as corrupt as the generation of Jews that crucified Christ; and if he were here today, and should preach the same doctrine he did then they would put him to death. I defy all the world to destroy the work of God; and I prophecy they shall never have power to kill me till my work is accomplished, and I am ready to die." (Essentials in Church History, p. 365; D.H.C. Vol. VI, page 58.)
Some eight months following this meeting with the saints, Joseph Smith with his brother Hyrum was martyred in Carthage Jail, having calmly willed to surrender to the Prophet's enemies in the assurance that the true priesthood and spirit of the Lord necessary to establish the Church of Jesus Christ were again on earth. His courageous mission had made this so. Now the work of God was a living reality as evidenced by testimonies of hundreds of faithful and devoted saints. The story of the swift and final days ending with the death of the Prophet will ever live in the hearts of those who love him, for with the unselfish gift of his own life, they may now lay claim upon the force of his testimony.
Let us briefly follow the steps of the story to see how boldly this modern seer of his own free will made the supreme gift for the Church of Christ he again established. It should be remembered that ever through the struggle to bring again the work of God in the latter days, the powers of evil bored from within as well as without. Men who at first were true, turned false, to join with those who ever hated the truth. With the increase of Church membership and the promise of peace and plenty for the saints mounting, fear and jealousy stole into the hearts of Joseph Smith's enemies. He had now become a figure of national interest. As lieutenant general of the Nauvoo Legion, as mayor of Nauvoo, and as candidate for the office of President of the United States, prominent citizens sought him, wondered at his wisdom, and often inwardly feared the divine power of his office as prophet of God. Those who could curry favor of him for their own advantage did so, and those who feared, sought secretly either to work upon the ignorance and hatred of fanatical mobocrats to bring about his overthrow, or, by failure to act in the cause of justice, used their office to wink at infractions of the law. Thus because of the words of weak-willed officers, the saints suffered; their Prophet time and again was arrested, then arraigned before a court of justice to stand trial, only to be set free.
So between the cross fire of writs which shuttled back and forth between the Governors of Missouri and Illinois, he threaded his way in and out of the trials where enraged deputies lay in wait to ambush him. Such had been his lot up to that January in the year of 1844.
During the months of February and March which followed, often his thoughts and acts were turned to constructive plans toward the fulfillment of the Rocky Mountain prophecy of August 6, 1842. It was decided to send some twenty-five men to explore all the mountain country, carrying the gospel message wherever they went. Any man who could "raise $500, a good horse and a mule, a double-barrel gun, one barrel rifle and the other smooth bore, a saddle, and bridle, a pair of revolving pistols, bowie-knife, and a good saber" might volunteer. Visioning the future of his people, the Prophet predicted that within five years the saints would be out of the power of their enemies, and asked that his
words might be written down that none "need not say they had forgotten the saying."
Spring of the year 1844 was to see events that led up to the fulfillment of Joseph Smith's predictions concerning his own death. Within this season came the dark combinations of apostates. Men who before had been high in the councils of the Church met at the fifth. Chauncey L. Higbee, Robert D. Foster, Joseph H. Jackson and Wilson and William Law together with Austin Cowles, Francis M. Higbee, Charles Ivins and Charles A. Foster were implicated in a conspiracy to kill the Prophet. When exposed, the first five named were excommunicated. Imbithered, they, with others, attempted to organize a church of their own with William Law at its head. Their efforts were doomed to failure. Frustrated, they then sought other means to satisfy their alleged plans, and they hit upon a malicious course of airing their hatred of the Prophet and his cause by means of the press. Their organ, the Nauvoo Expositor, appeared June 7, 1844. It was filled with vile slander aimed at Joseph Smith and many of Nauvoo's leading citizens. Striking at the most vulnerable spot in the body armor of saints, they attacked the Nauvoo Charter, a document of most liberal and far-reaching grants, under which the then thriving commonwealth on the bend of the Mississippi had come into being. The citizens of Nauvoo could not and would not accept this underhand thrust at their very existence. Within three days the city council met and declared the Expositor a public nuisance. The city marshal, John P. Greene, with a few men then proceeded to the printing office where they pied the type and burned the printed papers. The day following, Francis M. Higbee made complaint before Thomas Morrison, a justice at Carthage, for riot and destruction of the press. The warrant required the Prophet to go before Morrison or some other justice of the peace for trial. Here was the explosion the mobs were waiting for. Assemblies of mobocrats, speeches, resolutions, extermination orders for the "wicked Mormons" threatened the saints on every hand. Nauvoo was placed under martial law with its Legion mustered for protection.
In his effort to comply with the law, Joseph Smith appeared before Daniel H. Wells?a non-Mormon justice, but after hearing the case discharged the matter. Enemies of the Prophet claimed the trial was unlawful. It became necessary for Joseph to appeal to Governor Ford of Illinois for protection. In a letter dated June 16, the Prophet requested the Governor to make a trip to Nauvoo in order to halt the threatening danger of the saints. Ford came, but stopped at Carthage, where he surrounded himself with the worst apostates who, in league with the mobs, drowned any cry for justice. President Smith and all those accused were commanded to come and appear before Thomas Morrison of Carthage for trial, if not peaceably, then to the clank of muskets and force.
June 22nd found the Prophet with his brother Hyrum and eight of his close associates at a meeting in an upper room of his office. Shortly after the curfew hour, Hyrum came down from his room to the
House to greet Reynolds Cahoon with these words, "A company of men are seeking to kill my brother Joseph, and the Lord has warned him to flee to the Rocky Mountains to save his life. Good-bye Brother Cahoon, we shall see you again." (D.H.C. Vol. VI, page 547). It had been the decision of that evening to have the Prophet flee.
The next morning, the Governor's posse arrived in Nauvoo to find no Prophet. Shortly after noon that day, Emma Smith sent word by Orrin P. Rockwell to have her husband return; he having the night before just crossed the river. The most cutting part of the message bore the news that some of the leading brethren had accused the Prophet of cowardice. Realizing, then, that there would be those who would mistake the true reason for his departure, which was for the safety of his people, Joseph determined to return "and see the thing out." Hyrum stood one with him.
The next day found these two brothers with the accused members of the city council and a few friends riding to the town of Carthage. Behind them the green and pleasant city of Nauvoo lay under the warmth of an early morning sun in June. The rattle of hoofs and the stretch of saddle leather talked their recedies. It was a company of about sixty mounted militia, under the command of Captain Dunn, who reined to a stop the little party. Orders were to have the Nauvoo Legion surrender all state arms. Meekness and might again had met. The Prophet spoke:
I am going like a lamb to the slaughter, but I am calm as a summer's morning. I have a conscience void of offense toward God and toward all men. LESSON DEPARTMENT 433 If they take my life I shall die an innocent man, and my blood shall cry from the ground for vengeance, and it shall be said of me "He was murdered in cold blood!" Essentials in Church History, p. 376; D. H. C. Vol. VI, p. 555) Defenseless and at the mercy of their enemies, once more the saints found themselves as the hour of midnight saw their Prophet in Carthage ready to stand trial on the false charge of treason against the State of Illinois. The two days that followed are black upon the calendar of eternal justice. A Governor's broken pledge, an illegal summons, the impatient cruelty of a mob that would not wait for the law, all crowded the remaining earthly hours for the Prophet and Hyrum Smith as they sat in the Carthage Jail. It was after five on the afternoon of June 27. Elder John Taylor had just finished singing for the second time, at the Prophet's request, "A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief." There was a discharge of arms at the outer door of the jail. Dr. Willard Richards hastened to the window to see about one hundred armed men at the door, many with blackened faces. The guard at the door fired into the air, as a flying wedge of men burst through the door and up a flight of stairs into the room that held the Prophet and his party. Shouts rang out as a shower of bullets poured into the room. Hyrum Smith fell crying, 'l am a dead man." Joseph, struck by two balls, lunged for a window?to fall into a circle of murderers, his parting words a testimony, "O Lord, My God!" It was done. The testator of the latter day work had sealed his life's mission with blood to give enduring strength to the cause he championed. What greater gift could any prophet bestow upon his friends? Suggestions for Active Reading and Discussion With the help of the suggested readings given below have the class carry on the discussion as follows: first answer the question; second read the assigned part in the text to discover wherein we must "give heed unto his word." The class period for this opening les-soTT can be a very challenging one. There is within the story of the martyrdom much to be felt as well as discussed. The great shock of learning how innocent men were struck down by the very ones who ought to have loved them for the words of life they had taught can but leave the heart hurt and the mind forever wondering. There can be no real end to the brutal story of the death of Joseph and Hyrum Smith. Such a lesson as this will bear rereading many times just as the tragic news bore retelling many times during those last days of June in the year 1844. I. What are the personal blessings you now possess which will always put you in the debt of the Prophet Joseph Smith? One or two from each person will provide interesting facts to be discussed.

Read chapters 31 to 35 in Essentials in Church History by Joseph Fielding Smith. & Visiting Teachings? Messages Sources of Strength?Charity Dr. Lowell L. Bennion Preview of Lessons for 1945-1946 MESSAGES for visiting teachers this year are based on Paul's masterful and inspiring discourse on charity found in I Corinthians, chapter 13. The subject is appropriate, for charity, as Paul defines it, lies at the heart of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Then, too, the Relief Society was organized, above all other reasons, to cultivate and express the spirit of charity. In this preview we shall consider the meaning of charity and give an overview of the messages which are to follow. What did Paul mean by the word "charity"? It is clear that its meaning was not restricted to almsgiving as it sometimes is today. This is evident from Paul's early statement: "And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing." To Paul charity also meant more than generosity and tolerance, attitudes which are implied in the expression?a charitable heart. Paul used charity as we use the word love. Such was the meaning of charity in 1611 when the King James translation of the Bible was made. More modern translations of the Bible use the word love because of the more restricted meaning which has come to be associated with the word charity. Thus "love" is a synonym for "charity," although charity seems to have its own distinctive meaning as well (See Moroni 7:47). Love is the greatest principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ. For this assertion we have the word of the Master himself. It is interesting to contemplate what a certain lawyer may have anticipated as an answer to the question he put to Jesus, "Master, which is the great commandment in the law?" Did he, perhaps, expect Jesus to quote one of the Ten Commandments? If so, he must have been surprised to hear the answer. "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets" (Matthew 22:35-40). The lawyer may well have been surprised, but not because these commandments were new, for they are included in the Mosaic law in Deuteronomy 6:5 and in Leviticus 19:18, respectively. The new thing in Jesus' restatement of these ancient laws was that he brought them together, made the second like unto the first, and made everything else in the Law of Moses and the Prophetic writings depend on these LESSON DEPARTMENT 435 two, on love. Love was to be the matrix, the warp and woof, and the heart and spirit of life. The apostle Paul, recognized for his faith in Christ, also knew that this faith must lead to love and must always be accompanied by love to be of worth, as he declared: "... And though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing." (I Cor. 13:2) "For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself (Galatians 5:14). A world ravaged by war and filled with hate is starving for love and charity. Children, parents, neighbors, fellow-Church members, the stranger within our gates, the widow, the orphan, the returning soldier, and our "enemies" all need the charity Paul describes. What do we mean by charity? How can we express our charity in daily life? These are questions to discuss through the year. The answers are suggested in this year's topics: 1. Christ's Example Objective: To show that Jesus in his own life exemplified true charity, demonstrating that a life of charity is filled with love and is free from self- pity, intolerance, envy, and hate. 2. "Charity Suffereth Long and Is Kind" Objective: To inspire patience and kindness in our human relations. 3. "Charity Envieth Not" Objective: To show that the cultivation of the spirit of charity will help rid our lives of envy. 4."Charity Vaunteth Not Itself, Is Not Pulled Up? Objective: To show that true charity is self-forgetting. 5. "Charit}* Doth Not Behave It-self Unseemly" Objective: To show that charity is tactful and courteous because it is inspired by a reverence for life. 6. "Charity Rejoiceth In the Truth" Objective: To show that one who is truly charitable rejoices in the truth. 7. "Charity Hopeth All Things, Charity Endureth All Things" Objective: To show that charity meets offense with patience, understanding, and hope. 8. "Charity Never Faileth" Objective: To encourage people to put their trust in charity as the unfailing means of improving themselves and influencing others for good. (For excellent suggestions on how these messages are to be taught, see The, pp- 403-404). Suggestion: Every visiting teacher would enjoy and profit by the frequent reading of I Corinthians, chapter 13. SALT FLAT DESERT Thelma Ireland In the valley stretch the salt flats Which the purple mountains hug. And the contrast makes the desert Look just like an ermine rug. Lesson I?Christ's Example For Tuesday, October 2, 1945 Objective: To show that Jesus in his own life exemplified true charity, demonstrating that a life of charity is filled with love and is free from self-pity, intolerance, envy, and hate. JESUS said, "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light" (Matthew 11:28-30).
Jesus had seen the yoke upon the oxen, how it aided them in pulling the plow. Thus, he likened himself and his teachings to a yoke which, if taken upon ourselves, would make it easier for us to bear the burden of life. More than anything else this yoke was to be the principle of Christ-like love or charity.
The life of the Master was big with love "as a tree with blossoms in the spring." His charity knew no limits, no bounds, neither height nor depth. It was everything which Paul said of charity?patient, kind, free of envy, unselfish, courteous, sincere, enduring, and unfailing.
Jesus did not discriminate in expressing his charity for men. Only the self-righteous hypocrites came under his condemnation (Matthew 23). To the rest of mankind he gave freely of himself. When his disciples rebuked parents for bothering Jesus with their young children, "he was much displeased." Moreover, he used the occasion to teach a great truth (Mark 10:13-16). So aware was he of the needs of people,
that he was sensitive to the touch of faith by the woman who dared only to feel his garment (Mark 5:24-34). Here again we may contrast the attitude of his less sensitive disciples who wondered that Jesus should discern a single touch in the midst of a crowd. Pharisees and scribes marveled and murmured because there "drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him" (Luke 15:1-2). Out of compassion he fed the weary multitude. (Mark 6) His last prayer to be recorded in full was a petition, not for himself, but for his disciples and all who should believe in him, "that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us. . . ." (John 17:21). As he hung on the cross his final request in behalf of the Roman soldiers who had carried out the orders to crucify him, was, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do," (Luke 23:24).
A life full of charity such as that of Jesus has no room in it for selfpity, intolerance, envy, or hate. It will not be overcome by pain, suffering, and sorrow, for it will always know the joy and spiritual renewal that accompanies love. Truly Jesus' yoke of love and charity is easy, and his burden light to those who take them upon themselves. LESSON DEPARTMENT 437 Literature The Bible in Our Literature Dr. Howard R. Driggs Preview of Lessons for 1945-1946 ONE central purpose motivates this course. Its lessons are intended to help those who make an active study of them to get a clearer, more appreciative understanding of the vital role played by the Bible in the creating of our literature. Each lesson offers an alluring quest with-in this broad and fertile field. Rewards of devoted work will be more intelligent, more recreative reading, with greater skill to select literature really worth reading. From the class viewpoint, these rich returns will come only if the course as an air-pilot might say, is kept "on the beam." Manifestly, in the limited time that can be allotted to the lessons, the main goal must be kept ever clearly in view. Each lesson, it is true, will prove an "open sesame" to treasures of literature; yet the natural temptation to linger too long over the gems, must be resisted by teacher and class member if the larger, spiritual end is to be attained. It is hoped, of course, that individuals and groups will be inspired to carry on beyond the classroom in further uplifting enjoyment of precious literature that is found. Both definiteness and flexibility mark the study plan. Every lesson, a unit in itself, helps to carry forward the central theme. It points the way to discovering how the Bible, in different ways, is woven with artistry into the type of literature with which the lesson deals. At the same time, it opens opportunity to draw freely upon not only time-tested literature but promising literature of the living present, for appropriate selections and quotations to add convincing concreteness to the main message to be impressed. Lesson 1. Our Literature Before the Bible Came A study reaching back into the legendary past?when our days were named ? and songs and sagas in vigorous, alternative lines were created. Typical selections from this folklore will be used in portraying the background of primitive thought, feeling, and ideals which were later to be illumined, shaped, and spiritualized through the influence of the Bible. Lesson 2. How the Bible Is Woven Into Our Literature A study of both the outward and inward phases of the shaping of our literature through the influence of the Bible. Such more tangible aspects, as Biblical allusions and expressions, as well as those more spiritual in nature. Biblical themes and ideals, will receive attention in this lesson. Lesson 3. Bible Influence as Revealed in Our Lyric Literature A study of typical songs inspired by stories and living truths of the Bible. Selections to impress the depth and breadth of its influence in the creation of our lyric literature will be made from the classic carols on through the years down to the present. Some precious lyrics will be included in the lesson for special consideration. Lesson 4. Bible Influence on Our Epic or Narrative Poetry This study will center attention on certain outstanding poet story-tellers who were markedly influenced by the Bible in their creative work. Chaucer, Milton, Tennyson, Longfellow are among these. A limited selection of their well-known story poems will be used to make the message of this lesson clear and concrete. Lesson 5. Bible influence in Our Drama This study, beginning with brief attention to the old plays created to impress Bible stories, will specifically deal with other dramas through the years centering around Biblical characters and themes. Attention will also be given to the influence of the Bible in shaping and spiritualizing dramas that grip and hold the hearts of humanity. Lesson 6. Bible Influence on Our Fiction This study naturally, like those preceding, must be severely limited to consideration of a few typical and worthy novels whose themes or central characters are essentially Biblical. Its range will be from tested earlier fiction to present creations which reveal classic qualities. Brief attention will be given to the more general spiritual influence on other worthy fiction. Lesson 7. Bible Influence on Essays and Oratory Again the scope of the lesson will be restricted to the study of a few inspiring types of the essay and to certain outstanding orations that show plainly Bible influence. These will be taken from past and recent literature of these two important kinds of expression. Reliance of great writers and speakers on the Book of Books will be made clear. Lesson 8. Bible Influence in Literature for Children A forward-pointing study to help parents get closer to the book companions of their children and grandchildren. Children's literature, except for Mother Goose and Fairy Tales, is mainly of more recent creation. What of the Bible influence is revealed in most of the books produced for children today? In this lesson, directed opportunity will be given to make some selective research to answer this question, and out of it to bring to our children more well-written, Bible-inspired literature of living appeal for them. Text and References First, the lessons themselves are to be the guiding text. Each of these units should be carefully studied by teacher and members of class. Questions for study should be thoroughly considered before the lesson is given; and the suggested activities carried through, both before and after the lesson. Second, for general references the following will be found most helpful: The Bible?King James Version (also Modern Reader's Bible ?"by Moulton). General reference books may be added later. Note: Specific references will be given with each lesson. Lesson I?Our Literature Before the Bible Came For Tuesday, October 16, 1945 TN one of Longfellow's Tales of A Wayside Inn, "The Saga of King Olaf' is a poetic portrayal of the bringing of Christianity to the "Land of the Long Night." This old tale, first told to Longfellow, it is said, by the famed Norwegian violinist, Ole Bull, reveals that the message of our Master was carried into that stern realm not by any meek spirit, but by a hard-hitting viking. LESSON DEPARTMENT 439 Ringing lines from the lyric which opens the Saga, suggest the contest that lay ahead of this champion of the gospel. They sound also a keynote for this course. THE CHALLENGE OF THOR I am the God Thor. I am the War God". I am the Thunderer, Here in my northland. My fastness and fortress Reign I forever! Jove is my brother; Mine eyes are the lightning; The wheels of my chariot Roll in the thunder, The blows of my hammer Ring in the earthquake! Force rules the world still, Has ruled it, shall rule it; Meekness is weakness, Strength is triumphant. Over the whole earth Still is it Thor's-Day! Thou, art a God, too, O Galilean! And thus single-handed Unto the combat. Gauntlet or Gospel, Here I defy thee! Following this vigorous lyric, in spirit and form suggestive of songs of the long-ago Norseland, comes a stirring ballad, sketching Olaf's adventurous youth, and a spiritual awakening which led to his leadership in carrying the cause of Christ into his homeland. Opening lines of this ballad are: KING OLAF'S RETURN And King Olaf heard the cry. Saw the red light in the sky. Laid his hand upon his sword, As he leaned upon the railing. And his ships went sailing, sailing Northward into Drontheim fjord. There he stood as one who dreamed; And the red light glanced and gleamed On the armor that he wore; And he shouted, as the rifted Streamers o'er him shook and shifted, "I accept thy challenge, Thor!" With swiftly moving lines, the ballad goes on to tell how Olaf's mother, Queen Astrid, after her husband, king of Norway, had been slain by a usurper, fled with her son to a haven with "Hakon old"; how, still pursued, she again fled, this time to be captured and enslaved. Later, Olaf as a boy was recognized and restored to freedom by an uncle. Then he became a roving viking, and finally converted in Sicily by a hermit, was baptized into Christianity. Fired with the purpose of avenging his father, reclaiming his realm, and spreading the gospel through the reconquered nation, Olaf had come with his ships and fighting followers back to old Norway. He would illumine that region of the 'long night" with what had enlightened his own life. What the ideals, the inlook and outlook on life, of the rugged Northland folk were before Christianity came is mirrored in literature they created. Fortunately, in the Icelandic Eddas preserved for us, we have a wealth of their myths and legends, expressed in their vigorous, forthright style, to get us closer to their feelings and thoughts?their gods and heroes. And these same gods and heroes were in the main the very ones worshipped by not only the Scandinavian peoples, but by all Teutonic folk. In the Nihdungenlied a main source of the tales portrayed in the Wagnerian operas, are the same basic stories and characters as those in the Norse sagas. Anglo-Saxons, from whom came the English and Lowland Scotch, carried these tales across the Channel when they made their conquest of England. This, so far as we know, was their earliest literature. And it still is actively with us. Indeed, we pay something of tribute, though mainly without thought of it, to certain of the mythical Teutonic gods in our names of the days. Nature worship with something of mysticism seems woven into the conceptions of these deities of the Northland. Baldur, god of the sun, beloved for the light and warmth he brought to the Land of the Long Night, was honored in Sunday, first day of the week. Monday was named for Mani, a beautiful youth, who rode his shining steed, Alswider, across the night sky. Tyr, courageous war god, who gave an arm to assure the binding of the terrible Fenris Wolf, is remembered in Tuesday. Wodan, the all-father, with the ravens. Thought and Memory, on his shoulders, and with valiant heroes slain in battle, and beautiful shield-maidens, the Valkyries, ever about him, is perpetuated in Wednesday. Thor, fighter of frost giants, whose beard flares in the northern lights, whose eyes flash in the lightning, gave his name to Thursday. Freya, goddess of love and beauty, who rides through the sunny skies of spring and summer scattering flowers and fruits and bringing bird songs to cheer the northern realm, is remembered in Friday. Saturday, reserved for the last day of the week, comes from Surtur, fiery leader of the forces of evil, who, the gods ever feared, might break forth with destructive power in the last days upon their nine worlds. Confronted with conceptions such as these descriptions suggest, the bearers of our Savior's message had a difficult mission to implant principles of the everlasting gospel. Olaf, meeting Thor's challenge with blow for blow, succeeded in winning back his kingdom, and in making Christianity the official religion of his realm. Real conversion, as always, was a slower process. It had to come by weaving into the lives of the people the principles and practices of true religion. No small part of this was done through the infusion of the story and the spirit of the Savior into the national holidays. Yuletide, for example, which through untold years had been a time of feasting and drinking and wild revelry in celebration of the annual victory of Thor over the Frost Giants, was now commemorated as Christmas, in honor of Christ who came to bring "Peace on earth, good will toward men." Easter, likewise, was made no longer just a celebration of the advent of spring, with joyous pageantry in honor of the beautiful goddess Oestara. It was a holy day in soulful remembrance of the resurrection of our Savior. Another profoundly significant phase of this spiritualizing development came through the intrinsic changes wrought in our literature. Just as the old gods of Greece and Rome fell in both a material and a spiritual sense as Christianity rose, so did the gods of the Northland rather suddenly disappear. Only in Iceland, separated from the mainland by about eight hundred miles of ocean, did the sagas persist in 
original form for some centuries. That is why these stories are best preserved in the Icelandic Eddas.
Like the classic mythology of the Greeks, these sagas are, from in art viewpoint, great literature. They reflect the culture, the customs, the emotional life and ideals of that long ago. Something of a natural poetic skill was in the ancient skalds who created the strange stories. They had ample time to practice the art of story-telling during the long nights. And, since there was no printing press then, it had to be not story-reading, but story-telling.
One of the choice old tales out of the Northland impresses the basic value and the need for more such story-telling in our lives. In this mythical tale we are told that at one time, the gods, to commemorate a decisive victory over the Frost Giants, decided to create a man. It was agreed that, when the new being had been fashioned in his earthly image, each god should endow him with some precious gift. So they came, one after another to fulfill this pledge. One of the gods touched the lips of the newly created man that he might have the gift of speech; another touched his throat that he might sing. A third god touched his eyes that he might see; not only with his outward, but his inward or spiritual eye; still another touched his heart that he might have sympathy for all creatures.
And, lo, when this man spoke, it was as no other had done before. In his words one could hear the song of birds, the whispering of the breezes, the roar of the ocean, the prattle of children. All the music of man and of nature at the same time. In wondrous voice, and he became the first poet.
Basic truth is in this old tale. The poet does portray in musical lines the life he knows. In consonance with this, one feels through these sagas the courageous struggle with harsh elements?cold and darkness. Winds howl and breakers crash on rocky shores. Then comes ecstasy with the advent of the brief seasons of sunshine and revelry. Heroes of battle are extolled and tragedy accepted with something of a fatalistic attitude. Extravagant exploits are detailed, all to help while away the lengthened hours. In keeping with some of the "tall tales" and radio story-acting today, these old sagas were primarily for pastime. They gave entertainment?rather than recreation.
Had our literary development stopped there, it would have never been completely soul-satisfying; Entertainment is wanted, but not that alone. What was lacking to round out and enrich literature of long ago was just what the Bible brought. It was an infusion of spirituality, new conceptions of life, the message of the Savior. That these stalwart folk of a new life came to bring to minds to new heights.

Christensen Preview of Lessons for 1945-1946 THIS is to introduce the second year's series of the social science lessons dealing with problems of social ethics. As suggested by the title, our chief concern is with modern applications rather than with historical or philosophical abstractions. The world today is in trouble, and the only way that it can right itself is by a return to virtue. Major principles of morality were outlined last year but, since each of these has such a direct bearing upon the problems we are about to examine, it is suggested that the class leader review the earlier lessons occasionally and use them whenever possible as background material for the discussions ahead. The lessons prepared for 1945-46 are built around certain modern problems to which the application of ethical principles is sorely needed. Titles and lesson aims are as follows: Lesson 8. Patterns of Prejudice and Persecution Lesson aim: To emphasize the prevalence of bigotry in the modern world and to show how its existence stands as a threat to democracy, Christianity, and the good life. Lesson 9. Problems oi Personal Conduct Lesson aim: To stress the importance of personal cleanliness, balanced conduct, and self control to the good life. Lesson 10. Leisure and Morals. Lesson aim: To demonstrate a relationship between modes of recreation and morality, and to suggest ways for improving the morals of society by making better use of leisure time. Lesson 11. Women and Morals Lesson aim: To analyze some of the social and moral problems peculiar to women in this modem world, and to emphasize woman's moral role and responsibility in the field of ethics. Lesson 12. Morals In Marriage and Family Relationships Lesson aim: To analyze our most basic social institution from the standpoint of moral conduct, listing some of the common faults, and pointing out some of the principles necessary for correction. Lesson 13. Some Broader Applications of Social Ethics Lesson aim: To examine some of the inequalities and inhumanities existent in the world today, and to show that justice, when not violated, leads to both peace and happiness. Lesson 14. Morality and the Church Lesson aim: To examine religion as a moral force in life; and to point out some of the pitfalls, as well as principles, in religious ethics. Discussion questions and references at the end of each lesson are given to stimulate and guide in a general way rather than to prescribe or limit the work of the class. The teacher should read as widely as is practicable, using Church literature day Saint viewpoint, eliminating, and library materials freely. But and adapting materials as the needs she will need to be discriminating and interests of the class reveal also; sifting according to the Latter themselves. Lesson 8?Patterns of Prejudice and Persecution For Tuesday, October 23, 1945 Lesson link: Last year's lessons in this department were based upon the belief that much of the world's sorrow and suffering could be alleviated by a quick and complete return to virtue. It has been through deserting the great moral principles of the ages that individuals and nations have got into trouble, and the only way that this trouble can be dissolved and real happiness brought to the earth is by an enriched understanding of moral principles and a genuine willingness to apply them in life. Lesson aim: To emphasize the prevalence of bigotry in the modern world and to show how its existence stands as a threat to democracy, Christianity, and the good life. PREJUDICE means pre-judgment on the basis of bias, or without sufficient examination or understanding of a thing. Persecution refers to the act of annoying, oppressing, or attacking someone else to cause him injury or suffering. Prejudice is a perversion of truth and persecution is a desertion of the brotherhood principle. Both are immoral.
"Why persecutest thou me?"
These words of the Lord to Saul might well be applied to many of us in this modern day. Saul, it will be remembered, was prejudiced against the saints and had been persecuting them bitterly for some time. Then, while on the road to Damascus, he was accosted by the Lord who gave him to understand that persecution of the saints was at the same time a persecution of the Saviour. Saul repented, was converted, and later became an apostle in the church (Acts, chapter 9). But just as Saul offended city and worked against his own salvation by harming his fellow men, so do those today who, failing to catch the vision of a Christian world and the spirit of brotherhood which is an essential part of it, remain intolerant and antagonistic toward their fellow men. Selfishness, ingratitude, intolerance, discrimination, oppression?all of these and more are marks of prejudice and persecution. They are offensive to God and are a mockery of morality, and yet the world is full of them and their kind. Unless altruism can push aside selfishness, love outdo hate, and world brotherhood supplant provincialism and the exploitation of peoples, the future will not be bright and mankind will not find the peace and happiness to which it is entitled.
Personal Animosity
When people become too self-centered they lose the "social sense" discussed in an earlier lesson, and through indifference and hate they neglect and abuse their fellow men. Egoism and arrogance lead to selfishness, antagonism, and oppression. The desirable person is the one who is interested in others; thoughtful of their needs, sympathetic with their sufferings, charitable toward their shortcomings, appreciative of their services, and helpful in all things. LESSON DEPARTMENT 445 Love, fellowship, and fraternity are basic in any system of morality. But many of us during some of the time, and some of us during most of the time, fall far short of this ideal. We verbalize the good life in our worship and then fail to actualize it in life. Practice, unfortunately, too, often lags behind preachment. How many of us, for example, give even when we are not asked to, and give unselfishly with no thought of publicity or personal advantage? It has been said that for some people "faith, hope, and charity" means merely having faith in the hope that they won't be asked to give charity. Society is full of handicapped and unfortunate people. How many of us are actively looking for them with the idea of doing something to help relieve their suffering? Or, in contrast, how many of us merely rest on the smug feeling of personal self-righteousness and figure that other people can take care of themselves. If the latter, we would do well to remember that self-righteousness is really not righteousness at all; moral action of the highest order is always oriented toward society. We are our brothers' keepers. The "good Samaritan" will always get closer to heaven than the pious but selfish egotist. When social relationships disintegrate farther than selfish indifference and neglect, when they become actively antagonistic and hostile, then all the more be the need for a return to virtue. When individuals become malicious and militant in their abuse of others, resorting to ill-willed gossip, slander, and other forms of attack, to destroy what they don't like, then morals take a holiday. No system of ethics can be built upon animosity and hate. Let us remember the words of Christ when he said, *'Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you" (Matthew 5:44). If we can love our enemies as well as our neighbors, as Christ enjoined us to do, then we will have no enemies?except the enemy of evil itself. And this, of course, is the good life at its best. Partisan Animosity But partisan animosities are just as prevalent and just as serious as personal ones, perhaps even more so. Religious persecutions furnish one of the clearest examples of this prejudice, intolerance, and persecution in the world today. Many pages of the world's history are bloody with accounts of religious persecutions and wars. It is not our purpose to recount these historical details here, but it is our purpose to point out that war and bloodshed are antithetical to the Christian ideal, and the very fact that there has been so much shedding of blood in the name of religion is evidence enough that this ideal has seldom if ever been reached. Jewish persecution, or anti-Semitism as it is called, has reached new peaks in ferocity and brutality during the last decade or so. Coming mainly from Germany, the movement has spread over practically all the world until now no place is entirely free from its vicious influence. Its spirit is one of hysterical bigotry as intense as the world has ever known. Already there are signs that anti-Semitism may be gaining momentum in America. May it never come! Anti-Catholicism is another example of religious bigotry. There are plenty of instances where individuals have been defeated in office or deprived of other opportunities just because they were Catholics. This should never be permitted to happen in America. Latter-day Saints have so long been the recipients of intolerance and persecution from the outside that they ought themselves to be some of the most tolerant people on earth. Knowing what it is like to be on the receiving end of bigotry and mob violence, we ought to be particularly kind and sympathetic toward other groups now. And perhaps we are. But a little critical group introspection wouldn't hurt, and if made honestly it might lead to the discovery that we are sometimes indifferent or even intolerant toward some of the minority groups suffering at the hands of the prejudiced. Tolerant participation is the answer to religious persecution. The solution to religious conflict does not require an acceptance of foreign dogma. But it does require a tolerant understanding of other groups' points of view and a willingness to work together even without complete uniformity or agreement. Conviction concerning one set of dogma should not preclude tolerance toward others. The Crisis in Morality Partisan animosity and bigotry by no means end with religious persecution, but our space is short and perhaps this will suffice to illustrate. The reader may wish to supplement this with additional examples from economics, government, or other fields. But the point that the very moral structure of our society is being threatened, due to bigotry and a tendency toward expediency, must not be lost. Both Christianity and democracy were founded upon the principles of equality and fraternity; their ideas were humanitarian and unitarian in nature rather than exploitive and individualistic. One need only search the scriptures and then compare them with the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States to know that this is true. And yet we haven't been living that way; our practices haven't been in line with our professions; our actions haven't conformed to our ideals. Christians in name, we have nevertheless been quick to slander and' to persecute. Democratic in the framework of government we have nevertheless maintained our prejudices, fought for selfish vested interests, and discriminated against unfortunate minorities. All of this is undemocratic. It is also un-American, if we are big-souled enough to identify the American way with the right way. The crisis in morality is also a crisis in Christianity, and in democracy, and in the American way of life. The future of all of these institutions depends upon the victory of love over hate, altruism over selfishness, fraternity over bigotry. LESSON DEPARTMENT 447 Problems for Thought and Action 1. To provide a brief review of last year's lessons, show how happiness, progress, freedom, truth, honesty, and brotherhood all fit into an integrated moral system. Note: The class leader will find it advantageous to reread the last lesson from last year's series; i.e. Lesson 7, "Brotherhood, the Key to Greatness." 2. What do we mean when we say that morality is socially oriented? What did Jesus mean when he said, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" Discuss. 3. Distinguish between personal and partisan animosity and illustrate each. What should be our attitude toward the handicapped and the unfortunate? Why? Use scripture to support your position. 4. Give examples of anti-Semitism. Of anti-Catholicism. Of anti-Mormonism. Compare. Why should Latter-day Saints be particularly tolerant of other peoples? Are we more tolerant than other people? Give examples on both sides of this question and make suggestions for improvement. What is the solution for religious persecution? Discuss. 5. Do you agree that Christianity and democracy are ethical ideals that have not yet been reached? Make suggestions for reaching these ideals. Do you think that the world would then be any more happy? Any more moral? Why? Selected References Standard Works: Bible: Proverbs 16:16-19; Matthew 5:43-48; 6:14-15; 7:1-5; Mark 12:28-31.

And suddenly she was running down the road, swiftly, to the shelter of her home and her room and her thoughts of Hugh. (To he continued) "MISSING ?
