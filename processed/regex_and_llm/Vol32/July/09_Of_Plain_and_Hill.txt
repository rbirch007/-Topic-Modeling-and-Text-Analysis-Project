OF PLAIN AND HILL Dott J Sartori You who faced that West of long ago-Roadless, hostile, citiless, unknown   Who dared to trust your frail mortality To oxen's gait, to prairie waste and stone. I seek your sweet sublime obedience, I need your simple faith in God's great will, For, ever must each generation cross Some trackless treachery of plain and hill.
