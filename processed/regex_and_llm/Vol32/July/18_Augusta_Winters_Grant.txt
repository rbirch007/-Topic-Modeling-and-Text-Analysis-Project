Augusta Winters Grant Observes 89th Birthday IT is with pleasure that the General Board, on behalf of the entire membership of Relief Society, congratulates Augusta Winters Grant who will observe her 89th birthday on July 7, 1945. The life of Sister Grant up to the present time has been replete with many of the richest experiences which this life affords. She has been a close companion and loving wife to her husband, the late President Heber J. Grant, and has fully assisted and sustained him in his high position as the President of the Church. In company with President Grant, Sister Grant has traveled extensively, and to all whom she has met she has radiated a spirit of friendliness, interest, and charm. It is the heartfelt wish of the women of the Church that the Lord's choicest blessings may rest upon Sister Grant, that she may enjoy health and happiness throughout the years that lie ahead, that by her presence she may bless her numerous friends and her posterity.
