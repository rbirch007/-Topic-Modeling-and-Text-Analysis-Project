The New First Presidency THE women of Relief Society, along with tens of thousands of other Latter-day Saints, rejoice that even though a great and beloved leader, President Heber J. Grant, has been taken from our midst, another has been raised up to guide and direct the affairs of the Church. It is comforting to know that in these days of anxiety and sorrow the earth is not without a prophet, seer, and revelator, one appointed to receive and make known the will of the Father for his children on earth. It is not by chance nor by the whims of God or man that one is called to hold so exalted a position upon earth. The Lord has told us that he rules in the heavens above and in the earth beneath in all wisdom and prudence. He showed unto Abraham "... The intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones; Arid God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast bom" (Abraham 3:22-23). Even though these great and noble spirits were chosen for their earth work before the world was, this is not enough. Page 414 They must prove themselves here; they must continue in righteousness as they live from day to day upon the earth. Thus President George Albert Smith comes to his position as head of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. A great and noble spirit, born of goodly parents, he has devoted his life to the service of his fellow men and to the work of the Master. He has labored diligently in building the kingdom of God upon the earth. He has traveled far and wide carrying the gospel message by precept and example. He has sat in the highest councils of the Church, being ordained an apostle by President Joseph F. Smith when only thirty-three years of age. For the past two years he has been President of the Council of the Twelve. President Smith comes to the position of highest authority in the Church beloved by members everywhere. His tender nature, his kindly ministrations, his thoughtful considerations, not confined to the prominent alone, but extended to the least of God's children, often at the expense of great personal inconvenience, have won him a host of friends within and outside the Church. Blessed are the Latter-day Saints to have such a president in this day of tribulation.
His two counselors, President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., and President David O. McKay, are men seasoned in wisdom and experienced in the work of the Church. They, too, are chosen men of God, men who through the nobility of their lives and the greatness of their leadership
have won the love, respect, and confidence of their fellows the world over.
The newly sustained First Presidency holds the esteem and confidence of Latter-day Saints everywhere. We acknowledge the good ness of our Heavenly Father in raising up able men to lead his Church, to guide his people, and to carry forward his work.?B.S.S.
