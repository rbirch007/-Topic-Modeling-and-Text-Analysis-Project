General Board of Relief Society Reorganized AT the opening session of the general conference of the Church held April 6, 1945, General President Amy Brown Lyman, First Counselor Marcia K. Howells, Second Counselor Belle S. Spafford, and the entire Relief Society General Board, including General Secretary-Treasurer Vera W. Pohlman, were released, with expressions of deep gratitude for the services rendered. Belle S. Spafford was sustained ninth general president of Relief Society with Marianne Clark Sharp as first counselor and Gertrude Ryberg Garff as second counselor. In announcing the reorganization of the General Board, the First Presidency stated that the decision to reorganize followed the favorable action upon the request tendered several months ago of President Lyman for a release from her position and labors. The action was also in line with the general plan inaugurated several years ago to change at some frequency the presidents and general boards of the Church auxiliaries. Amy Brown Lyman was first called to the General Board of Relief Society in 1909. She has served the organization successively as assistant general secretary, general secretary, general secretary-treasurer, as counselor to Louise Y. Robison in the general presidency, and, since January 1940, as general president. She has filled each position with outstanding success. GENERAL BOARD MEMBERS RETIRED Top row, left to right: Donna D.
