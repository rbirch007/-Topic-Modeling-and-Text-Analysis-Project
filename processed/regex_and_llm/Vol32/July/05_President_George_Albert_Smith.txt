The first child born to this couple, a son, named John Henry, died in infancy. On April 4th, 1870, a second son arrived who was named George Albert, after his paternal grandfather. Today, George Albert Smith is the honored President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the eighth man to hold that high and important calling since the Church was organized in 1830. President Smith grew to manhood in the Seventeenth Ward, Salt Lake City. In his home, he learned all those beautiful and impressive principles which have animated him throughout his life. His mother bestowed all the love and affection and tender care upon her children that it was possible for a woman to give. His father was a very exceptional and capable man, a true missionary and advocate of the principles of the gospel. When George Albert was ten years of age, his father, John Henry Smith, was chosen to be a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, following in the footsteps of his worthy and esteemed father. President George Albert Smith obtained his early education in the public schools of Salt Lake City. Later he was enrolled as a student at the Brigham Young Academy in Provo. There he came under the influence of that remarkable teacher, Karl G. Maeser, from whom he learned many valuable and impressive teachings which have remained with him through life. Returning to Salt Lake City, he took courses at the State University and continued his education. In 1892, shortly after his marriage to Lucy Emily Woodruff, daughter of Emily Jane Smith and Wilford Woodruff, Jr., George Albert left Salt Lake City on a mission to the Southern States. In a few months his wife followed him and together they performed their missionary labors, spending most of their time in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where Elder Smith acted as secretary of the Southern States Mission. On being released in July 1894, Elder Smith returned to Salt Lake City and was employed by the Zion's Co-operative Mercantile Institution until February 10th, 1898, when he was appointed receiver of the United States Land Office for Utah by President William McKinley. He held this position until he was chosen a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles at the October conference in 1903. Since he became an apostle, nearly forty-two years ago. President Smith has labored unceasingly for the welfare and advancement of the Church. It would require much more space than has been allotted to us here to enumerate his many activities. He has visited all the stakes and most of the missions of the Church. In 1919, shortly after the first World War, he was called to preside over the European Mission and in that capacity he traveled throughout Great Britain and on the Continent where the missions of the Church are located. On July 14, 1921, President Smith was released from his presidency in Europe. He returned at once to Salt Lake City and resumed his activity in the Quorum of the PRESIDENT GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 389 HONEYMOON AT NIAGARA FALLS President George Albert Smith and Lucy Emily Woodruff Twelve Apostles. Two years ago, he became the president of this Quorum following the death of President Rudger Clawson. He held this position until he became President of the Church on May 21st, following the death of President Heber J. Grant. Many honors have come to President Smith during the course of his busy life. AT Calgary, Canada, in 1913, he was elected president of the International Irrigation Congress.

The following year at Sacramento he was again re-elected to the same position, and in 1915 at El Paso, Texas, he was named president of that organization. Two years later he was elected president of the International Dry Farming Congress at Peoria, Illinois, and elected president of the Combined Irrigation and Dry Farming Congress at Kansas City in 1918. For many years, President Smith was active in the organization of the Sons of the American Revolution, and was six times elected as vice-president general. In 1918 and 1919 he was president of the Utah Society of S. A. R. He was one of the organizers of the Utah Pioneer Trails and Landmarks Association, and has continued as president of the organization since that time. He has recently been appointed chairman of the "This Is The Place" Monument Commission which is directing the preparation of the monument to be unveiled during the Utah Centennial in 1947 at the mouth of Emigration Canyon, where the pioneers first entered Salt Lake Valley. President Smith became a member of the General Board of Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association in 1904, and served until 1921 when he was named as general superintendent. He stood at the head of this great Church auxiliary for fifteen years. This work brought him in touch with scouting, in which he has taken an extremely active interest. He has ranked as the highest scout official in the Church, being given the Silver Buffalo. He has served for years as a member of the national executive board, Boy Scouts of America. To know President George Albert Smith is to love him. He is friendly, kind, considerate, devoted, and does not harbor animosity towards any human being. More than any man we know he has that rare quality of soul which permits him to exemplify the teachings of the Savior when he said: "Love your enemies; pray for them which despitefully use you. PRESIDENT GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 391 An index to his character may be found in a statement written by himself and published in the Improvement Era in January 1932.  I would be a friend to the friendless and find joy in ministering to the poor. I would visit the sick and afflicted and inspire in them a desire for faith to be healed. I would teach the truth to the understanding and blessing of all mankind. I would seek out the erring one and try to win him back to a righteous and happy life. I would not seek to force people to live up to my ideals, but rather love them into doing the thing that is right. I would live with the masses and help to solve their problems that their earth life may be happy. I would avoid the publicity of high positions and discourage the flattery of thoughtless friends. I would not knowingly wound the feelings of any, not even one who may have wronged me, but would seek to do him good and make him my friend. I would overcome the tendency to selfishness and jealousy and rejoice in the success of all the children of my Heavenly Father. I would not be an enemy to any living soul. Knowing that the Redeemer of mankind has offered to the world the only plan that will fully develop us and make us really happy here and hereafter, I feel it not only a duty, but a blessed privilege to disseminate this truth." President Smith's congenial happy home life was saddened, in November 1937, by the death of his dear and loving wife. Lucy Woodruff Smith was an ideal companion for her husband.
