President George F. Richards Elder Joseph Fielding Smith Member of the Council of the Twelve IT can be said of President George F. Richards, the newly appointed President of the Council of the Twelve Apostles, what the Lord said of Nathanael, "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile." There are, without doubt, many others who have given service to the Church and who are now giving service, just as true, just as loyal as President George F. Richards, but there are none, we may confidently say, who surpass him in the principle of loyalty, devotion and faithfulness to the cause of eternal truth. He was born February 23, 1861, in Farmington, Davis County, Utah. His early years were spent, as are the years of the average boy, on a farm, but he was also most active in the offices of the Aaronic Priesthood, and at an early age received the office of Elder and served as clerk of the Elder's quorum, ward teacher, in the presidency of the local M. I. A. And as stake missionary. March 9, 1882, he married Alice A. Robinson, and shortly afterwards moved to a farm in Plymouth, Boxelder County. In 1888 he moved to Tooele where he was ordained, January 29, 1890, to the office of High Priest and set apart as second counselor to President Hugh S. Cowans in the presidency of the Tooele Stake. Three years later, while serving in the stake presidency, he was ordained a Patriarch by Elder Francis M. Lyman, and in addition to the many duties in the stake presidency, he traveled through the scattered settlements of Tooele Stake giving blessings to all who sought them. In 1899, he was elected to the Legislature and represented Tooele County in the session of 1899-1900. PRESIDENT GEORGE F. RICHARDS He was also prominent in the civic affairs of Tooele County, on the district school board, as trustee and chairman of the Tooele Irrigation Company and the Tooele City Water Company. In December 1905, with his wife and son, Oliver, then a babe in arms, he accompanied President Joseph F. Smith and party to Sharon, Vermont, where the monument was dedicated to the honor of the Prophet Joseph Smith at the site of his birth, by President Joseph F. Smith just one hundred years after the birth of the Prophet. Page  The following year, April 8, 1906, he, with Elders Orson F. Whitney and David O. McKay, was called into the Council of the Twelve Apostles and was ordained by President Joseph F. Smith the following day. From that day until the present his life has been one of great activity, visiting the stakes of Zion, assisting in setting them in order, with the many special appointments and duties which his calling required of him. In the year 1916, he was called to preside over the European Missions, succeeding Elder Hyrum M. Smith. As the great war was on, his wife,4id not accompany him at that time because of the perils upon the water due to the activity of German submarines. He remained in Europe under the difficulties which arose due to the great world struggle, until he was succeeded by Elder George Albert Smith in June 1919. After the death of President An-thon H. Lund, in 1921, he was appointed to preside in the Salt Lake Temple which position he held until 1937, when he was released, because of numerous other responsibilities and because he had been appointed by President Heber J. Grant to act as Patriarch in the interregnum following the death of Patriarch Hyrum G. Smith. In his present calling as President of the Council of the Twelve Apostles, he follows in the footsteps of his father, Franklin D. Richards, who also served as the president of the Council following the death of President Wilford Woodruff, when Lorenzo Snow was sustained as President of the Church, in September 1898. President Richards enters upon his duties as the President of the Council with the love, the faith and the prayers of all the members of the Church, well prepared by long and faithful service.
