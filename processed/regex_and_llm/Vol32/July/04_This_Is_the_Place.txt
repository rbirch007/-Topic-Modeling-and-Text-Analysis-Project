THIS IS THE PLACE" C. Frank Steele  This is the place!" These valleys bare, this flaming sea, This burning sun, this broken tree; 'This is the place!" Take hold with patient heart, with ready hand. This shall be home, this your children's land. Water the earth, toil with the ax, the plow. Wait not tomorrow, build your cities now. Brave men shall prosper here. "This is the place!" And the light of God was on the Prophet's face. The Cover: "Furlough" by Willard Luce.
