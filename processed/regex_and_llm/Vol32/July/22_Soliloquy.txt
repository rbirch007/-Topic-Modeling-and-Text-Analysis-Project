Soliloquy Celia A. Van Cott Arid desert, land of the unconsolable Where the wailing wild winds moan Through the purple sage, where segos bloom In the land where the red men roam. Here in this disconsolate wasteland We've conquered, we've known no defeat; We've garnered the stars for our lamplight, In the bowels of the earth we found heat. Silver streams flash down the canyons, Brought from the high mountain's crest To the land of the blossoming valleys In Utah, sovereign State of the West.
