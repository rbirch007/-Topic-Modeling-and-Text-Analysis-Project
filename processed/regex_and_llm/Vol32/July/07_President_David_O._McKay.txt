President David O. McKay Jeanette Morrell Visiting Teachers' Message Leader, Twelfth Ward, Mount Ogden Stake THE home into which President David O. McKay was born proved the best possible environment to prepare him for the responsibilities that have come into his later life. It was characterized by regular family prayers, harmony, love, and hospitality which was enjoyed by many Church and civic leaders. His parents directed his youthful development with faith and with sympathetic understanding. As a boy, he had his dog, a pony, pigeons, rabbits, and other pets. There was the old swimming pool which was a gathering place for the boys of the town during the hot summer days, and, later, his interests were centered in the baseball nine and in an orchestra in which he was pianist. With all these activities, incident to pleasant life in the country, there was still plenty of well-organized work which he shared with his father and brothers. There was also an unswerving rule that all attend sacrament, priesthood quorum, and auxiliary organization meetings, and that the Sabbath be respected as a day of rest. Thus, proper and lasting habits were formed in his early life and they have proved to be valuable ones. When he was twelve years old, he received a blessing from Patriarch John Smith, then on one of his regular visits at the Huntsville home. PRESIDENT DAVID O. MCKAY Among many other promises, the blessing said,  The eye of the Lord is upon thee. It shall be thy lot to sit in council with thy brethren and to preside among the people and exhort the saints to faithfulness. And thou shalt go forth wherever thou art sent by the Priesthood, like a roaring lion in the forest, none to stay thee, for the power of God shall rest upon thee and give thee strength, wisdom and understanding." At the close of the blessing, Brother Smith placed his hand on David O's head and said, "My boy, you have much to do besides play marbles." Page  Thinking the Patriarch was suggesting that he give up the game entirely, he was quite perturbed and so expressed himself to some members of his family; for playing marbles was one of his favorite games and he was an expert in it. Only after his mother explained what Elder Smith really meant did he understand the meaningful remark. He was president of the class graduated from the University of Utah in June 1897, and, in August of that same year, left for the British Mission. Upon his return from a successful missionary experience, he commenced his career as a teacher first as an instructor in English and later as principal of Weber Stake Academy. In this latter position, he was not only an excellent teacher, but was father-confessor and spiritual adviser to hundreds of young people who still refer to him as the greatest influence in their educational and spiritual development. While directing the affairs of Weber Academy, he was called to the superintendency of the Weber Stake Sunday School Board. Under his supervision, a new era in religious teaching came into existence. The system of teacher-training, outlining lessons, and intelligent, organized presentation aroused new interest on the part of teacher and pupil, and brought deserved commendation from other churches and religious organizations. In 1895, "" became second assistant to President Joseph F. Smith who was then General Superintendent of Sunday Schools. In 1918, he was appointed General Superintendent, which position he held for years. Elder Bryant S. Hinckley said of him: "He brought to the Sunday School work not only an undivided heart, but the strength and devotion of all his splendid powers. Through the Sunday School, he has fostered two major objectives of the Church  the development of faith, and the building of character." From these duties, he was made a member of the Council of Twelve Apostles on April 8, 1906. His years as president of the European Mission and his world tour of Latter-day Saint missions, in company with Brother Hugh J. Cannon, are replete with faith-promoting experiences, and were paralleled only by recorded history of similar trips made by the ancient apostles. Many bishops, presidents of stakes, and a large membership of the Priesthood remember his strong advocacy of a Church Welfare organization long before it became a church-wide movement. In this, as in his stake and general Sabbath school and missionary work, were manifest an earnestness and vision that always result in progress. His everyday life has been consistent with his teaching and preaching, and has earned for him the love and confidence of all who really know him. He stands for what he thinks is right regardless of opposition or criticism, but he is tolerant and charitable toward all whether or not they believe as he does. He loves deeply and tenderly, as his family and friends can testify. President McKay's wide experi-(Concluded on page 448)
