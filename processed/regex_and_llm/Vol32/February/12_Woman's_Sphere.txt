Woman's Sphere Ramona W. Cannon VIT'AR has greatly revolutionized snobbish and unsociable attitudes in Great Britain. From duchesses down, women between the ages of eighteen and fifty are drafted for work; and many, too highborn for this privilege before the war, like work and wish to continue doing it. They also like the other women they meet. Three-fourths of the young people formerly rather lonely are now affiliated with youth groups, and juvenile delinquency has greatly decreased since these movements were organized. Nursery schools are excellent and numerous. Postwar planning embraces many civic centers for youths and adults with a complete range of cultural projects. Caroline Haslett, wartime adviser on women's training to the British ministry of labor, believes that, in the future, women will take a more important part in Parliament. HANNA KISTER, a Polish refugee, fled to America with her husband. They had been internationally known publishers in Warsaw. They have started the Roy Publishing Company in New York, and a book which Mrs. Kister discovered and had translated into English as "Blessed Are the Meek" has become a best seller. This beautifully written work is based on the life of St. Francis of Assisi, who gave up all his wealth to follow the Savior's pattern. What became of the book's author, Mrs. Zofia Kossak, in the tragedy of Poland, is unknown. EUROPE'S first woman commentator, Lisa Sergio, is now a resident of the United States, and is heard over the air on a national radio network. Her comments are intelligent and her English almost entire-Iv without accent. EDITH RUSSELL, a young British missionary with distinct writing ability, has been associate editor of the British Mission magazine, the Millennia] Star, for a year, the only woman to be on its staff during its 105 years of publication. AMERICAN-born Nancy Langhorne, now Lady Astor, was the first woman in Great Britain to be elected to the House of Commons. This is her twenty-fifth year in that position. She has decided not to stand again for Parliament. Page 87 EDITORIAL
