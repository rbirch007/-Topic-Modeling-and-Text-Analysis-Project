Work Meeting 
THE question of serving lunch at noon in connection with Relief Society work meetings, is fairly general throughout the organization, and has the approval of the General Board although not instituted nor required by the Board. Various plans are in effect for providing this lunch. For example, in some wards, groups of members are assigned to supply the lunch for the entire group once a year, in others, each member brings her own lunch and is supplied with a supplementary drink or dessert by the Society; and, in other instances, the Society meets the entire expense, assigning committee members to prepare the food. The
matter of meeting the expense of such lunches was considered at a meeting of the General Board, November 29, 1944, when it was decided that all Relief Societies should be authorized to use funds of the Society for this purpose, leaving it optional with local Relief Societies as to whether they meet this expense entirely, or whether they supplement lunches brought by members individually, or in assigned groups.
Although approving the custom of providing lunches at work meetings which extend over the lunch period, the General Board urges that such lunches be very simple.
Suggestive Program For Sunday Evening, March 4, 1945
IN accordance with the plan announced by the First Presidency in 1942, designating the evening meeting of Fast Sundays for use by the auxiliaries, the Relief Society was assigned the Fast Sunday evening meetings of March and November. The November meeting constitutes the annual ward Relief Society conference, but the March meeting is open for any type of program dating to Relief Society, coming as it does on the first Sunday of the month in which the Relief Society was organized.
Fast Sunday in March occurs this year, March 4, 1945. Ward Relief Society presidents may, therefore, consult their respective bishops and ask for permission to arrange for a Relief Society meeting on this evening. The General Board submits the following suggestive program for this occasion. Supplementary suggestions for the talks and copy for the dialogue "The Unseen Basket" have been mailed to stake and mission Relief Society presidents for distribution to local Relief Societies.

To Be Read Slowly as Relief Society Singing Mothers Hum X. Benediction THE BIG HORN BASIN Pliny A. Wiley The sun burst on the mountains? The Rocky western wall Where Yellowstone's great fountains Forevermore enthrall. The sun set on the eastern range The Big Horn's matchless steeps Where alpenglows in beauties change, And grandeur vigil keeps. In the Big Horn Basin's glory Beside its canyon grand, I read creation's story Writ by the Master's hand. I viewed the towering works of time; With aeons and ages I trod. I read his narrative sublime; The manuscript of God.
