TWO MEN Alice Money Bailey No secret in Potomac's placid flow Or in the cultured acres, in his blue Aristocratic birth, reveals the clue Of his endurance, strength. Could wealth bestow The fearlessness to walk where bullets sow The wind, the fortitude to pit his few In Braddock's massacre? Could ease imbue The heart for Valley Forge's blood-tracked snow? They say that he was pound-and-penny just, That he was moral, disciplined, and proud, Not far removed from kings in manner, trust Without close friends yet worshipped by the crowd. These are traits of greatness often won And held by other men than Washington. What was in the forest's darkened ais'le, In Lincoln's brawny youth, the rough frontier That he should know the hearts of men their fear Of other men or humor weakness while He built their strength, and how discern the guile Of policy? Too common, too sincere And unpretending to escape the sneer Of enmity, detect assassin's wile. Yet each grows great with time's far scrutiny, Each held in sacredness his country's sod, And knew in humbleness his destiny To form its mighty future under God. Two men: divinely sent, divinely planned To charter freedom in a chosen land! The Cover "Winter At Night" is from a photograph by Glen Perrins of Mt. Timpanogos taken from River Bridge.
