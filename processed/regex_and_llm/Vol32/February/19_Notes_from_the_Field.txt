NOTES FROM THE FIELD Vera White Pohlman, General Secretary-Treasurer Regulations governing the submittal of material for "Notes from the Field" appear in the Magazine for February 1944, Pg 104- MESSAGES FROM THE MISSIONS Australian Mission JUNE CANNON ORME, recently released president of Relief Societies of this mission, wrote September 14, 1944: 'The work of the Relief Society is greater now than ever before within the mission. With the strain of this present time weighing heavily upon the women of the mission, the lessons and work outlined by the General Board is more and more appreciated. The constant visits and need for home life by servicemen from many nations is being met by the women within the mission in a most admirable manner. The mission home, alone, gives relaxation to literally scores each month. Many of the sisters are doing their best to relieve the situation by opening their own homes, and have done so for many months. It is a wonderful labor and a very happy work. We appreciate more than we can ever tell the contact we have with the sons of so many mothers at home. Ninety-nine per cent of those mothers in Zion can rest assured that their sons are clean before the Lord; this same thing can be said of those mothers who have daughters in the services. We get to know them very well in their visits, we have them living and eating and praying, studying and relaxing with us, and their Page 104 attitudes and their worth speak well for the homes from which they come. The groups they form in advanced bases and the difficulties they surmount to form those groups is a living testimony of the fine homes from which they have come. Their devotion and desire to make contact with the Church upon arrival is a healthy sign. It is impossible to write an individual letter or history concerning each because they come and go so quickly, but such sons and daughters speak well for the women of the Church who are their mothers. I do not wish to depreciate the brethren who are the fathers in any way, but I am speaking only as a woman and knowing the program of the Relief Society, I think it is good, once in a while, to view the fruits of those who belong to this society." California Mission MRS. GLYDE BOOTHE, president of the Laguna Beach Relief Society, wrote recently: "Laguna Beach is a very picturesque little city, situated on the shores of the beautiful blue Pacific. The hills form a wonderful background, with lovely homes trailing to the upmost top of them. "We were organized September 6, NOTES FROM THE FIELD 105 ALEXANDRIA RELIEF SOCIETY, TEXAS MISSION Missionaries Lewis R. And Laura M. Jenkins are in center, front row 1942, with 13 members; today we have 14 members and 13 subscriptions to TheWe are fully organized. In 1943, we held a bazaar and made $105.50; in 1944, we cleared $300 at our bazaar. We start the first of the year and make certain things each month; for example, January, pot holders; February, aprons; March and April, dish towels; May and June, baby clothes; July, luncheon cloths; August, scarfs; September and October, pillow cases; November, miscellaneous. In this way our sewing has been a tremendous success. All credit goes to the members and the wonderful helpers I have." Texas Mission LAURA M. JENKINS, returning short-term missionary, brought to the General Board, during 1944, the accompanying picture of the Alexandria Relief Society, and a history from which the following excerpts are quoted: In the five years since organization of this Relief Society in 1938, we have organized a Singing Mothers' chorus, have canned six hundred cans of fruits and vegetables; have given bazaars; put on rummage sales; given box suppers; made candy and sold it, standing on the street corners, for ten cents a bag, until we raised approximately $300. When sugar was rationed we were given special permission to solicit various business houses, and raised $700 in this way in 1943. With this $1000, matched by the Church, we purchased a six-room residence for a meeting place. Throughout the five years, there have sometimes been from five to six women meeting regularly, and more often two and three; there have even been times when the president was alone. There have been four presidents of this organization: Sisters Melhus, Viola Armond, Rhoda Mae Jones, and Bertha Wehner. AUSTIN RELIEF SOCIETY, TEXAS MISSION President Ruth Paris is standing in the back row, second from left. We now have a fully organized society with a membership of seventeen." La Verne Walsh, secretary-treasurer of the Austin Branch Relief Society wrote in August 1944: "Early this year our Society held a rummage sale and a bazaar the proceeds from which totaled approximately $125. We contributed $25 to our Church Building Fund, and it is a source of pleasure to our Relief Society that we have never failed to donate a part of the proceeds of every project to this Building Fund. We are holding two work meetings a month this summer, and these are devoted to working on articles for our next bazaar. "In accordance with the Church Welfare Program, we have given much of our time to quilting, and this year have completed two quilts and have quilted one for a member. The quilting for members is one of our projects for the year. These quiltings are always enjoyable affairs, since we combine them with covered dish luncheons, and when the spirit of love, and friendship, and co-operation is added, then we have treasured memories in addition to a wonderful work well done. We should like, also, to voice our appreciation to the wives of the army and navy men, for giving their time and their talents to our Society." Northwestern States Mission TN April 1944, before her release as president of the Relief Societies of the Northwestern States Mission, Edna H. Bennion submitted the accompanying picture and following statement: "With the growth of war industries, many Latter-day Saints have come to the Northwest to work. Through the efforts of the missionaries a number of branches of the Church have been organized. In many places, they have started with NOTES FROM THE FIELD 107 RELIEF SOCIETY OF VANPORT, OREGON, NORTHWESTERN STATES MISSION (NOW IN PORTLAND STAKE) a Sunday School and a Relief Society. Such a Relief Society is the one at Vanport, Oregon, a housing area just outside of Portland. All of the women in the organization live at Vanport and many of them work in the Kaiser shipyards where their husbands are employed. They meet at 11 o'clock on Tuesday morning so they can be home in time to have dinner ready for their husbands as they come off day shift and the women go on the swing shift. They are all doing their bit to win this war, but they haven't lost their desire to meet at Relief Society. The Vanport Branch has grown to a complete organization of happy, faithful saints." This branch has since been transferred to the Portland Stake. Central States Mission THE following reports from five branches of this mission were all submitted during the forepart of 1944. Their mission Relief Society president is Lydia Ann M. Romney. May Kipp, president of Dodge City (Kansas) Branch Relief Society, wrote March 14, 1944: *'We were organized in the fall of 1940 with myself as president and Sisters Pauline Parsons and Louise Davis as counselors. We held our first bazaar a week before Christmas with very good success. We took in $35 which was an achievement as it established the bazaar idea within our group until we now sell handmade articles to many regular customers. We are selling a good many baby clothes at this time, and we, as a group, heartily endorse the idea of holding bazaars and keeping ready-made garments on hand. We have also made a good many surgical dressings and also cookies for the U.S.O." Ada Van Dam, president of the Fort Sill (Oklahoma) Relief Society, submitted the following statement prepared by Mary G. Matheson: "Fort Sill is the largest field artillery school in the United States. DODGE CITY RELIEF SOCIETY, CENTRAL STATES MISSION (Picture taken in 1942). Many Latter-day Saint men are stationed here and consequently" a goodly number of wives have accompanied their husbands from Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Arizona and other states. "We have organized a splendid branch, and the attendance at our Sunday School and the evening sacrament services rivals various Protestant gatherings held on the post. The services are conducted by army personnel as there are no civilian members located in this vicinity. With more of our brethren being stationed here, the number of vives coming out has increased, and many expressed their desire for a Relief Society. Ada Van Dam and Olive Phillips were instrumental in organizing our group under the direction of the Central States Mission. 'The first meeting was held in September 1943, with about ten sisters present. Our membership now averages twenty-three at every meeting. As we have no chapel of our own, our meetings are held in various members' homes once a week. "We are probably the youngest group, in age, of any Relief Society in the Church. Many of our sisters are attending out here for the first time in their lives. The majority are newly married and are about twenty-two years of age. "The lessons as outlined in Theare being followed and we all take turns instructing. It is a grand group, and the association with each other is doing much for all of us who are away from our homes in these troubled times. The branch is our mainstay, and we look forward eagerly to each meeting. "Our Relief Society is responsible for beginning and continuing to hold socials once a month for all Mormons here. The young fellows in the army await anxiously the announcement of the next social. We had a Christmas banquet. New Year's Eve party, Valentine dance, and are planning another dance for March.

"Our capable president, Ada Van Dam and her counselors, Olive Phillips and Margaret Jenson, and secretary, Cherie Lyon, are indeed doing a fine work. They are all from Salt Lake except Olive Phillips who is from Lehi, Utah." Shirley B. Paxman, a counselor in Wichita Branch (Kansas) Relief Society, wrote April 5,1944: I've been meaning to express appreciation to you for the wonderful Relief Society lessons we've had this year. Everyone has commented on how fine they are, and they have all enjoyed them, especially this winter. I've been teaching the Bible literature lessons this past year and every one has been a joy to prepare. The material in all the lessons is handled so well that I'm sure it accounts for the increased interest and attendance at our meeting. At home I rather thought the Relief Society was for the older women, but I find I was mistaken since being active in the organization here. Though our membership is comparatively small we've accomplished a great deal. We've quilted one quilt; made two wool afghans of crocheted wool blocks made from old dresses and suits, which we donated to the Red Cross for convalescent soldiers; had a victory garden from which we sold the produce and canned for members; held a rummage sale this winter which netted us $65 profit; redecorated the two rooms at the Church used by the missionaries; and other things. On March 17, we held a covered-dish supper and program at the church for all members of the Church and friends in commemoration of the 102nd anniversary of the Relief Society. RELIEF SOCIETY OF LITTLE ROCK BRANCH (ARKANSAS), CENTRAL STATES MISSION The officers, President Bessie Wilhite and Counselors Mary G. Wiggins and Lanoi Rowe are delighted with the good attendance which has been increased by wives of servicemen. The General Board has certainly done a magnificent piece of work in making the Relief Society program so timely and interesting to women all over the Church. We've found that the Relief Society has been an excellent missionary in this branch in getting nonmembers of the Church interested. Several of our Relief Society members do not belong to the Church as yet, but we feel sure they will soon." Maye Housley, secretary-treasurer of Oklahoma City Branch Relief Society, wrote last April: "Commemorating the Relief Society anniversary, a banquet was given March 18 by the Priesthood of our branch in honor of the Relief Society members. It was held in the Venetian Room of the Y. W. C. A. The Relief Society colors of blue and gold were used in table decorations. The theme "Memories" was carried out in the program. Our president is Dagmar Patterson, and counselors are Pearl Anderson and Grace Cullimore." A copy of the artistic printed program accompanying the write-up indicated that the entertainment included special musical numbers, a one-act play, and dancing. {To he continued)
