The Big Horn Basin Pauline Taggart Pingree Member of Relief Society General Board GRANDMOTHER Janet McNiven was left a widow with two small children, a son, James, and a daughter, Jessie, when she was a young woman. She lived in Edinburgh, Scotland, until 1863, when she heard the gospel preached by the Mormon missionaries and became convinced of its truthfulness, and was baptized.
As did most people during the early days of the Church, she desired to come to Zion, so she sold her business and all her household belongings, said goodbye to her kindred and friends, and started out with her two children for a new world and a new life.
They crossed the Atlantic Ocean in the good ship Underwriter, leaving Scotland the middle of March and arriving in New York on May 22, 1861. These saints, with others, were presided over by Charles W. Penrose, Milo Andrus, and Homer Duncan. The six weeks' voyage was very rough; many were ill, and one man died and was buried at sea. A weary trek across the plains followed their arrival in America. Imagine the heartache of grandmother with no companion to help her share her responsibilities! She had supreme faith, however, that she would reach her destination and be able to make a home for herself and children in Zion. She was a woman of very thrifty. She had a natural talent for nursing, and she always seemed to know what to do in an emergency and there were many emergencies on the plains. Fortune seems to smile upon those women who roll up their sleeves and put their shoulders to the wheel; upon women who are not afraid of dreary, dirty, irksome drudgery, who do not turn aside for obstacles, whether great or small. "He alone is great who by a life heroic conquers fate."
Grandmother and her two children did arrive safely in Salt Lake, and after a time she was married to Robert Hogg. Her joy at being in Salt Lake with the saints was shortlived, however. Brigham Young was calling men to go north, east, south, and west to start new communities. Grandmother, her husband, and children were sent to the little valley of Morgan where they settled in the town which is now known as Milton, about five miles from Morgan City. Here they built the first house in that locality. The first winter they had only one sack of flour and a very few necessities, and the winter was very severe.
Jessie (my mother) was now nine years of age. There were no schools of any kind in Morgan County and very few books. Mother learned to read and spell from the songbooks in Church. She was a beautiful singer, and she loved to memorize hymns as well as to sing them. In Page 76 THE BIG HORN BASIN 77 A. O. WOODRUFF AND JESSE W.
