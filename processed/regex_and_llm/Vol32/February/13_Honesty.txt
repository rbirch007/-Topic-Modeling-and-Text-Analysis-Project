Honesty IN considering life as it must be met today, one is forced to recognize the need for straight thinking, courage, steadiness of purpose, stability of character, and a firm belief that God is at the helm. We must acknowledge the need for mankind to accept in practice, as well as in theory, the great moral principles of the ages, a desertion of which has always brought sorrow or destruction. We must realize that character building is in reality "the most important business of life," and that character is built through the adoption of moral virtues such as simple honesty, truthfulness, and love.
