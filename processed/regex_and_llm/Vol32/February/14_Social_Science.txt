social science lesson declares honesty to be the "core of character." He says, "It would be impossible to conceive of character without honesty, for any structure founded upon deceit and falsehood is founded upon sand rather than rock, and must inevitably fall." Yet, mankind throughout the ages has deserted this fundamental virtue. Strange as it may seem, he has done this in an attempt at self-benefit. But always in the end it has rebounded to his injury. The Bible furnishes us a good example of this. A certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession. Instead of turning it all to the apostles, as was the plan, they held Page 88 back part of the price, being dishonest with both man and God. Peter severely rebuked Ananias. Upon hearing the words of Peter, Ananias fell down dead, and his wife likewise. Examples of dishonesty are all too plentiful. Every day we hear or read of dishonest behavior or we encounter it in some form or other. An item in a local paper, issued immediately following Christmas, reported that the Christmas season of 1944 closed with one of the worst shoplifting periods in history. At one drugstore losses from larcenists were estimated as high as $500 a week, and a special office had to be set up to "reprimand" shoplifters. Shoplifting, store managers agreed, was not confined to needy persons as several influential citizens were caught with stolen goods. One store manager declared, "The number of adults guilty of shoplifting would put any juvenile delinquency campaign to shame." He estimated his losses would run into thousands of dollars for the month of December. Dishonesty takes many forms. It appears as lying, cheating, stealing, deceiving. It asserts itself in thinking and in motives. It may be expressed by word, by deed, and by implication. It may be directed against man and God, and there are many who are dishonest with self. EDITORIAL No matter what its form or against whom it is directed, dishonesty is destructive and demoralizing. It injures the one who practices it. And wrongs the one against whom it is directed. It in no way builds nor strengthens nor benefits. Honesty, or any other moral virtue for that matter, cannot be established in a day. Moral instruction to take root must be started early and it must be continuous. Morality cannot be taught merely by precept; precept must constantly be supported by example. Parents, mothers in particular, must realize their tremendous responsibility in this respect. Knowing how desperately the world is in need of a return to the absolute moral principles which have always served mankind, recognizing how urgent is the world's need for honest men and women-men and women of character?we should give full attention to the building of such men and women. If we would conscientiously begin iK)w to train our youth to be strictly honest and virtuous, if we would teach them to put principle above immediate personal gain, the next generation would have a world fit to live in. BSS. A Pioneer Story?The Big Horn Basin (Continued from page 85) kinds of vegetables are canned. Considering the obstacles the early pioneers encountered and the struggles they had in order to get along during the first few years, they did remarkably well and proved themselves to be strong souls. "The tendency to preserve, to persist in spite of hindrances, discouragements, and impossibilities: it is this that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak." In the final analysis it does not make much difference where we live, but how we live; it is this that determines our success in life. Therefore, I would say to all people "Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life" (John 6:27). "And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not" (Gal. 6:9). Historical dates included in this article are from the book by Charles A.
