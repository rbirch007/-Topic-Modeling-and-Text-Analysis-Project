Lesson 6 Clean Things Last Longer (For optional use on Tuesday, March 9, 1943)
NOT only is "cleanliness next to Godliness," but it is also economical. It is easier to keep clean than to make clean. Dirt wears things out, whether they be fabric, wood, plaster, leather, or fur. Good materials are entitled to good care. Waiting until they are very dirty before cleaning them means added rubbing and scrubbing that wears things out as much as does the dirt that is ground into them in the first place. While it is necessary to keep things clean to conserve them, it is also necessary in cleaning them to use the process best suited to the material or fabric involved. Some fabrics take kindly to mild soap and water, while others require dry-cleaning agents. The difficulty today is in knowing the material with which one is dealing. Rayon, the versatile fiber, is woven into a variety of fabrics; and since these fabrics are so extensively used, it is important to have a knowledge of their care. Some rayon fibers lose their strength when wet; others are dissolved when cleaning agents are used; and some are melted by the use of too much heat. The cleaning of any material containing rayon fiber depends on the nature of the weave as much as the fiber itself. Rough or creped surfaces should usually be dry cleaned. If material can be washed, the kind of soap, the temperature of the water used, the handling while wet, and the length of time given for drying are important items to remember. All fabrics of rayon, silk, and wool, whether used for clothing, upholstering, curtains, draperies, or rugs, require a mild soap, luke-warm water, little handling with no harsh rubbing or wringing. A long time is required for properly drying all of these fabrics except pure silk, which dries quickly. The amount of soap required will depend upon the harshness of the water, and whether or not a softening agent is used. Trisodium phosphate is a good detergent. Sheer fabrics when washed should be rolled in a soft absorbent cloth, such as a turkish towel, to absorb the excessive moisture, and they should be ironed with a warm iron while damp. Some fabrics, because of fineness, construction, or color, respond best to dry cleaning, and if done at home, extreme care should be taken in the handling of articles and in the selection of the cleaning agent to be used. Whether laundering or dry-cleaning method is used, stains should be removed from the article before the whole article is cleaned. The proper time to remove stain is when it is fresh. Air, heat, and water may change the character of the stain and make it difficult to remove, if it can be removed at all. It is much easier to remove a stain without injury to the fabric if the kind of stain is known. Most ordinary stains on tub-fast, washable materials, such as cotton or linen, can be removed with warm water; or in case of fruit stain, boiling water poured from a height. Stubborn stains, like ink, require special treatment.* Clothing and fabric articles that can be handled easily should be brushed often and regularly. Dust and dirt work into the meshes of the weave and cut the threads. The best time to brush clothing is immediately after wearing. Underwear and stockings should be washed often; fibers deteriorate with perspiration and body acids. In most homes, rugs and upholstery usually get a bigger share of the wear than other articles. To avoid some of this wear, they should have a quick daily cleaning, rather than to allow dust and dirt to work into the pile. A more thorough cleaning should be given weekly. The best cleaning implements to use are a vacuum cleaner and a carpet sweeper. Sweeping with a broom, especially against the pile, will further embed the dirt, and may tear or damage the soft, wool nap. Greasy spots and soil cause dirt to stick, which, in turn, dulls the colors. A good nonflammable cleansing fluid will brighten colors and remove spots. Some kinds of rugs and upholstery can be shampooed with safety if a thick jelly-like suds is made of neutral soap and applied with a brush using a circular motion. The lather should be scraped off with a dull broad knife, and then wiped off with a damp, clean cloth wrung out of clean warm water. This process should be repeated as many times as is necessary to remove all soap and soil. As little water as possible should be used. Articles should be allowed to dry thoroughly before being used. A thorough cleaning occasionally by an expert will prolong the life of such furnishings. Hard shaking of small rugs breaks the backing and unravels the ends or fringe. A rug laid on a smooth surface or over a pad not only wears longer but is easier to keep clean. If slip covers are used, they should be removed often enough for cleanliness and to make sure that moths do not lurk beneath them to feast on the precious fabrics of the davenport or chairs. Tablecloths, luncheon cloths, and

napkins are made of various kinds of fabrics, such as cotton, linen, rayon, silk, and Cellophane. Linen and cotton, if white, can stand hot water; if colored, warm water should be used in washing. They should be washed quickly, rinsed thoroughly and, if white, dried in sun; if colored, they should be dried in the shade. Grass linen is stiff and should be handled carefully so as not to break the threads. Cotton and linen require a hotter iron in pressing than do other fabrics. Mats made entirely of Cellophane only need to be wiped with a damp cloth to clean. A bit of starch in the rinsing water will give cotton a gloss when ironed and keep it clean longer. Never use starch for other materials, especially linen. If ironed linens are rolled on a pasteboard or paper roll rather than folded, they keep fresh, clean, and wear longer. The folds in larger cloths should be changed occasionally to prevent wear along the line of the fold. Bedding should have its share of care. A clean, soft, but firm mattress, fluffy clean blankets, and clean sheets are inviting and help one to rest well. Soiled bedding is not nearly so warm as clean bedding. Regular airing and sunning of the mattress will keep it fluffy. A mattress should have a cover that fits snugly and that can be removed for washing. The rules for washing table linen apply also to bed linen. Over-washing of woolen blankets mats the

nap and causes harshness and shrinkage. Blankets will be fluffy and soft if dried out-of-doors on a mild, breezy day. Sheets hung straight and smooth on the line, dried, and then carefully removed and folded, need

not be ironed other than to press the hems. Occasionally the wood of furniture needs a thorough cleaning with thick soap suds to remove the grime and smoke that collect and dull the beautiful surfaces. In modern heated homes, furniture gets too dry, which sometimes causes it to crack and come apart. If washed carefully, a small part at a time, without much water, wiped thoroughly dry with a soft cloth, and polished with a good furniture polish rubbed with the grain of the wood, the wood of most furniture will look like new, and the little bit of water used will help restore the moisture drawn out by overheated houses. Floors often become loose and squeak from the same cause. Floor surfaces should be kept clean, and the finish, whether oil, wax, paint, or varnish, should be well applied. This prevents the floor from wearing, whether it be wood, linoleum or tile, and is particularly important where floors receive great
wear. Too frequent and too generous use of soap and water has a tendency to deteriorate rather than preserve some finishes. Each kind should have its own treatment. Paste, liquid or self-polishing wax are sometimes used too generously. When there is an accumulation of this wax, it should be removed; the floor should be thoroughly cleaned and new wax applied. Painted walls may be cleaned with a mild soap and water, or a water softener or solvent and water. They should be wiped well after washing. Long even strokes should be used when wallpaper and calcimine are cleaned with the dough-like preparations now on the market. Rubbing back and forth makes streaks and embeds the dirt in the paper. The main point to remember in cleaning all materials and articles is that they should not become too soiled.
