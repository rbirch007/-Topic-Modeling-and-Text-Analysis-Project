Leaflets on Health, Home Nursing and First Aid to be Distributed in February, 1943
CONTINUING the century-long interest and activity of the Relief Society in health and nursing, the General Board urges that all families take precautions to preserve health through such means as proper nutrition, adequate clothing and bedding, and general care, suggests that all families, insofar as possible, provide themselves with first aid supplies, and advises the women to take courses in first aid or home nursing, or both, and to cooperate with their local Relief Societies in the establishment of home nursing supply chests. These suggestions are of special importance during the present war conditions because of possibility of disaster or epidemic, and because of curtailment of hospital and nursing service for civilians, making it necessary to depend to great extent on home nursing. Relief Society visiting teachers, when making regular visits for the month of February, will leave at each home a leaflet on these matters issued by the General Board of Relief Society.
First-Aid Kits for Families: The leaflet contains a recommended list of first-aid supplies for families, not only those families in war risk areas but families in all other areas as well, for use in case of accident or household emergencies. It is recognized that it may not at all times be possible to procure all the articles listed, but it is suggested that families provide themselves with such articles and partial quantities as can be procured. Many families doubtless already have on hand most of the articles in the recommended list of supplies and need only to take stock of the supplies which are on hand, to assemble them in a receptacle which is easy to carry and keep them in a safe and readily accessible place. The leaflet includes excerpts, reprinted with permission from the American Red Cross First Aid Text Book, describing the various articles recommended for the family first-aid kit and explaining their uses.
Demonstration of First-Aid Supplies at February Work-and-Business Meeting: All Relief Societies in war risk areas, and all others desiring to do so, are requested to conduct a demonstration of the articles recommended for the family first-aid kit. This demonstration is scheduled for the February work-and-business meeting, unless otherwise announced, and where possible is to be conducted by an individual acquainted with first-aid practices who will explain the use of the various articles and demonstrate the making of triangular bandages and splints, so that these articles can be made in Relief Society work meeting (or in the home) and added to the family first-aid kit along with articles which are purchased.
Relief Society Home-Nursing Supply Chest: The General Board recommends that every ward Relief Society wherever located arrange to accumulate a supply of articles ordinarily needed for home nursing in case of sickness or disability, such articles to be either rented or loaned according to circumstances of families using the supply. Believing that many families have such articles which are not in use and which they would be willing to give or lend to Relief Society supply chests, particularly at the present time when some articles cannot be procured by purchase, a survey form accompanies the leaflet to be distributed by visiting teachers in February upon which families may specify such articles as they would be willing to give or lend to such a home-nursing supply chest.
Adequate Bedding for All L. D. S. Families: During the past few years, many stake and ward Relief Societies, at the suggestion of their respective Church Welfare Committees, have conducted bedding projects to encourage and assist all families within their boundaries to be well equipped with good beds and bedding. The Relief Society now urges all families to make a follow-up check of their bedding facilities and make an effort to provide themselves with any additional bedding which is needed. Comfortable and adequate bedding is particularly needed at this time because of curtailment of the fuel supply in many communities due to exigencies of war and because of the need for protecting the health of every individual during this war period while nursing and medical facilities and supplies are limited. Because of present conditions with respect to labor, materials, and war production, only those bedding supplies which are currently needed should be procured at this time. Suggestions have been issued to ward Relief Societies for cooperative plans whereby members supplying their own materials may have quilting done at Relief Society meetings.
Women Advised to Take Courses in First Aid and Home Nursing: The General Board of Relief Society again advises that all women able to do so take the Red Cross course in first aid or home nursing, or both. Many Relief Societies are arranging with the local Red Cross chapter for these courses to be given in the wards, and members may make inquiry of their local Relief Society president or their local Red Cross chapter concerning such courses.
Other Recommendations Applicable Only in War Risk Areas: The General Board recommends that in war risk areas, ward Relief Societies procure ward first-aid supplies to be kept under jurisdiction of the Relief Society in ward meetinghouses. A recommended list of such supplies for these areas is contained in a bulletin dated December 29, 1942 and sent to all stake, ward, and mission Relief Society presidents. This bulletin also recommended that in war risk areas at least one woman in each stake be called to prepare herself as a Red Cross first-aid instructor who will conduct first-aid classes for the convenience of the women in the local wards of the stake. In these areas an additional survey is to be made by the visiting teachers in February to ascertain supplies which families would be able to make available, upon call of the ward Relief Society president, for use in case of emergency entailing temporary housing other than in homes. Accordingly, in sections considered by stake or mission authorities to be war risk areas, a special survey form for this purpose will accompany the leaflet to be distributed by the visiting teachers during the month of February.
Petitions on Informative Labeling
The General Board of Relief Society is cooperating with the National Council of Women in petitioning the Office of Price Administration to require that goods bear informative labels clearly stating what an article is, of what it is made, how it is made, what service it will give, and how it should be cared for. All Relief Society members in the United States can help achieve this desirable goal by signing petitions which will be explained and circulated at a Relief Society meeting.
Suggestive Program for Sunday Evening, March 7, 1943
IN a letter dated April 26, 1942, the First Presidency designated the evening meeting of Fast Sundays for use by the auxiliary organizations. At a meeting of the general executives of the auxiliaries, the Fast Sunday evening meetings of November and March were assigned to Relief Society. Ward Relief Society presidents may therefore consult their respective bishops and ask for permission to arrange for a Relief Society meeting on the evening of March 7, 1943. This is a very favorable Sunday on which to present a Relief Society program, coming as it does on the first Sunday of Relief Society anniversary month. The General Board submits the following suggestive program for use on this evening. Wards desiring to plan their own programs are at liberty to do so. Much of the material for the suggested program is drawn from The American Citizens Handbook recommended for use in the social science course, "What 'America' Means." The objective of the program is to show that the cause of freedom is the cause of Christ. Democracy finds its fullest expression in the roots of religion, which has ever emphasized the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man. For democracy to reach its highest fruition, our society must include that larger liberty preached so eloquently by the Hebrew prophets and by Jesus. (American Citizens Handbook, page 16.) As planned, the program will honor the boys in the service, their parents, wives, and children. It is suggested that seats be reserved at the meeting for the honored families and that Relief Society presidents consult their respective bishops concerning a display of pictures of ward members who are now in the service, if such pictures are not already on display in the chapel. The flag of our nation should also be prominently displayed. Mimeographed copies of the program for use by the audience would add greatly to the success of the program. In order to insure a large attendance, it is recommended that visiting teachers on their regular February visits invite all ward members to be present at this meeting and that advance announcements of this meeting be made in Relief Society and other ward gatherings. Relief Society members should particularly be urged to attend. The patriotic theme of the program is timely and should appeal to all, both old and young. The program will be more effective if regular ward announcements to be made at the meeting are made preliminary to its presentation.

Suggestions for Presenting the Program
The above program may be presented with or without special scenic and lighting effects and with or without special costumes according to the facilities of the various wards. The opening remarks by a member of the ward Relief Society presidency should briefly welcome those in attendance, point out the theme and objective of the program and explain that it is the outgrowth of one of the Relief Society courses of study of the past year, "What 'America' Means." She should also announce that the families of ward members who are in the service are being honored, giving the number of ward members who are in the service. It is suggested that the person who offers the invocation be advised in advance that the theme of the program is patriotic. The foreword to be given by a young woman (in patriotic costume if desired) is adapted from "You, at This Moment," The American Citizens Handbook, page 4, as follows: You, at this moment, have the honor to belong to a generation whose lips have been touched by fire. The human race now passes through one of its greatest crises. New ideas, new issues, a new call for men to carry on the work of righteousnessall these have come and are daily coming to you. When you are old, however, memory brings back this moment to your minds, let it be able to say to you "That was a great moment." This country in its crisis called for men and women of faith in God, of patience in service, of charity and of insight. I responded to the call however best I could. I gave myself to the Master, to the cause of humane and brave living. For the talk "The American Way of Life is the Christian Way of Life," see The American Citizens Handbook, page 6, et passim; also an address by Elder Stephen L Richards, Deseret News, Church Edition, June 6, 1942. The following excerpts from the address by Elder Richards are particularly appropriate for use in this talk: This is a Christian nation. America had its inception in Christian principles and doctrines; it was founded, nurtured and built by Christian men and women, Christian concepts have been incorporated into its basic laws and institutions and its loftiest ideals and purposes are but the expression of Christian virtue. We hear a lot of talk nowadays about the American way of life. What is this American way of life? Is it anything other than the Christian way of life? If it differs essentially, if it contemplates something other than Christian liberty under law, then I'm not so enthusiastic to have my sons fight for it. I believe, however, that you will find on analysis that this American way of life we prize so highly is in reality a Christian concept.... Restraints are supposed to be imposed by self-discipline rather than exterior force. People are free to make their own choices, endowed with a freedom that can be curtailed or limited only as may be necessary to assure the same freedom to all.... I make the assertion that we cannot hope to obtain that great spiritual support which we now so sorely need except upon the basis of truly Christian living. I think this to be so necessary because, as I interpret the issues at stake, we are really fighting a religious war. I think that our armies on the battlefields of the world and our civilian army here at home are really fighting to preserve the cause of Christ in the earth. I know they may not be conscious of such an objective. I wish they were. Since this talk is to be followed by the singing of "Recessional," it would be well for the speaker to refer to what usually happens when men forget their dependence upon God. She might even quote from the "Recessional," saying that it is to be sung following her talk. Following the rendition of the "Recessional," the talk "Our Church Stands Ever Ready to Preserve the Cause of Freedom," is presented. In this talk it is suggested that the speaker explain how our Church has always stood by our

NOTES TO THE FIELD
country in her hour of need. Reference could be made to the Mormon Battalion and the history connected with it. At this point, someone in the background representing President Brigham Young might speak, first apparently addressing Captain Allen in these words: You shall have your battalion, Captain Allen, and if there are not young men enough we will take the old men, and if they are not enough we will take the women. Brigham Young might next appear to address members of the Mormon Battalion as follows: I want to say to every man, the constitution of the United States as framed by our Fathers was dictated, was revealed, was put into their hearts by the Almighty, and I tell you it is as good as ever I could ask for. I say unto you, magnify the laws. There is no law in the United States or in the Constitution but I am ready to make honorable. Following the statements by Brigham Young, the speaker might continue, pointing out that at the time of World War I, President Joseph F. Smith said: I believe it is righteous and just for every people to defend their own lives and their own liberties, and their own homes, with the last drop of their blood. I believe that the Lord will sustain any people trying to preserve their wives and their children from the ravages of war. At the conclusion of the talk "Our Church Stands Ever Ready to Defend the Cause of Freedom," the "Credo" by Elias Lieberman, The American Citizens Handbook, pp. 70-71, would be very effective read by a soldier, if one is availablethis to be followed by a patriotic number from the Relief Society Singing Mothers. The talk "Our Boys As Missionary-Soldiers," to be given by a young woman, could explain what some of the ideals are that can be fostered in service men by the girls at home. The following brief excerpt from a letter recently written to a mother by her son who is serving his country overseas might be read: I wish it were possible to tell you in person how much I depend upon my Heavenly Father for guidance and inspiration; how each day the Gospel means more and more to me. During these distressing times and periods of temptation the principles which you and father have taught me through deeds and words are always before me, and they serve as a real stabilizer. I feel I am able to be tolerant without compromising; to segregate the good from the evil, for I understand the source. Humbly I feel that through the help of the Lord and you dear ones at home I am able to be an influence for good. For the short tribute "Our Flag," which should precede the singing by the congregation of the "Star Spangled Banner," see the short article, "Respect the Flag," The American Citizens Handbook, p. 151. During this tribute, the flag, which has been in evidence during the evening, might be spotlighted and an electric fan used to make it wave as the congregation sings our national anthem. At the conclusion of the singing, while the audience remains standing, the same young woman who gave the foreword should give the conclusion, as follows: America first, not merely in matters material, but in things of the spirit. Not merely in science, inventions, motors, and skyscrapers, but also in ideals, principles, and character. Not merely in the calm assertion of rights, but in the glad assumption of duties. No flaunting her strength as a giant, but bending in helpfulness over a sick and wounded world like a Good Samaritan.... Not in treading again the old, worn, bloody, pathway which ends inevitably in chaos and disaster, but in blazing a new trail along which, please God, other nations will follow, into the new Jerusalem where wars shall be no more. Some day, some nation must take that pathunless we are to lapse into utter barbarismand that honor I covet for my beloved America. The American Citizens Handbook, p. 61. The speaker then looks heavenward as she voices this prayer by the poet Longfellow: Lord, let war's tempest cease, Fold the whole world in peace Under Thy wings. Make all the nations one, All hearts beneath the sun. Till Thou shalt reign alone, Great King of Kings.
Publication of Leads for Class Leaders Balance
THE, pp. 640, 655, announced that a new book, "Leads for Class Leaders," to be issued by the Relief Society General Board, would be ready for use sometime during the fall, 1942. The General Board sincerely regrets that due to unavoidable circumstances work on the book was delayed, making publication impossible during the fall of 1942 as announced. It is the present plan of the General Board to issue the book in time for use during the next educational year, which begins in October 1943.
It is suggested that no closing song be sung and that the benediction follow Longfellow's prayer. The estimated time required for the presentation of the complete program as outlined is one and one-half hours. It is suggested that wards desiring to give less time to the presentation of the program either omit the talk, "Our Boys As Missionary-Soldiers," or combine its message with the talk, "Our Church Stands Ever Ready to Defend the Cause of Freedom." The tribute to the flag might also be eliminated in the interest of time. Suggestions for appropriate musical numbers will be found in The, pp. 868-870.
Elder Stephen L Richards Lectures Over KSL
BEGINNING Sunday evening, December 27, 1942, and continuing each Sunday for several weeks, Elder Stephen L Richards, of the Council of the Twelve, is delivering on the regular Sunday evening broadcasting time of the Church, over radio station KSL, at 9:15 M. W. T., a series of lectures entitled "The Church in War and Peace." The broadcast originates in the Tabernacle on Temple Square. Special vocal music is under the direction of J. Spencer Cornwall, director of the Tabernacle choir, with Alexander Schreiner, Tabernacle organist, at the console of the great organ. This broadcast should interest and value to all Church members inasmuch as the lectures give Gospel interpretations of present-day situations.
NOTES TO THE FIELD 43
Message of First Presidency Published In Booklet Form
THE message from the First Presidency delivered in the Tabernacle, Saturday, October 3, 1942, during the opening session of the 113th Semi-Annual General Conference of the Church, has been published in convenient booklet form, size 3x4", and distributed to Latter-day Saint families throughout the Church, to missionaries, and to Latter-day Saint men in the service. The General Board expresses its appreciation to the First Presidency for making this important message available in such convenient and attractive form. Relief Society members are urged to read the message carefully and thoughtfully, and it is suggested that mothers discuss it with their families. The counsel and guidance given on drink and the Word of Wisdom, chastity, parenthood, unity, and the war are of vital importance to us today. The message to the men in the armed service, and the blessing, commendation, and comfort given to officers and members of the Church are of inestimable worth.
Relief Society Presidents to Encourage Use of New Book, "Recreation in the Home"
RELIEF SOCIETY presidents are requested to cooperate in the distribution and use of the new book "Recreation in the Home" recently published by the General Boards of the auxiliary organizations of the Church. Coming at a time when the use of automobiles is restricted and when other conditions incident to the war make it necessary for us to be resourceful and economical in our recreational activities, the book meets a present-day need. It contains many new games and many old favorites, and is fertile in suggestions for many other types of recreation. Games and other activities included in the book can be played and enjoyed by large and small groups of all ages, with a minimum amount of equipment, work, and expense required. To aid in the distribution and use of the book, ward Relief Society presidents are asked to announce its publication at one of the regular Relief Society meetings, preferably a work-and-business meeting, calling attention to its content and its value for use in the home and for larger groups. It is also recommended that the book be used in planning Relief Society parties or other social activities, thus demonstrating its value. Relief Society officers and members should not only know that there is such a book, but should own and use it. "Recreation in the Home" may be purchased from the Relief Society General Board, 28 Bishop's Building, or from the general offices of the other Church auxiliary organizations. Price 25 cents, postpaid.
The Mormon Handicraft Shop
THE Mormon Handicraft Shop is your shop, established to help Relief Society women. Are you supporting it? There are three ways in which you can help the Shop: First, the Shop must have articles to sell, such as pillowcases with lovely white crocheted edges, quilts, attractive aprons, exquisite clothing for babies, useful hot pads, fine handkerchiefs, etc. When articles are beautifully made, of suitable, good material, and of desired colors, they will sell readily. The Shop can now use many such articles. You can encourage women to make these lovely articles to be sold. Have you found that lonely sister or the one who is homebound and have you encouraged her to make some lovely and useful article? This interest would mean a great deal in her life. How about the sister who needs to help herself financially, who would appreciate having a little extra money of her own to spend? This is made possible by sending her articles to be sold. The second way in which you may help the Shop is to buy there whenever possible. When you need a distinctive handmade gift, reasonably priced, it can be found at the Shop. Remember, this is a day of advertising. Never miss an opportunity to tell your neighbors and friends about Mormon Handicraft. Third, you may help the Shop by paying the annual membership fee of $1. Many of our wards are paying this yearly fee, and in so doing are helping to support this worthy project. May we add your ward to our list of Mormon Handicraft supporters? We feel, especially, that wards in close proximity to the Shop should support it in every possible way.
Auxiliary Leaders Protest Picturization of Smoking and Drinking
UNDER date of November 14, 1942, the following letter signed by the general presidencies and superintendencies of the Church auxiliary organizations, was sent to Mr. Will H. Hays, of the nation's film industry, protesting the picturization of smoking, drinking, and vulgarity in films. These auxiliary leaders represent a total active membership of 747,688 men, women, and children. The increasing use in motion pictures of tobacco and alcoholic beverages is alarming, and it is in recognition of the effect of this upon youth that the auxiliary leaders ask that an effort be made to eliminate these items from the films as far as possible:
Mr. Will H. Hays 28 West 44th Street New York, New York
Dear Mr. Hays:
For some time the auxiliary organizations of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have been alarmed at the increasing use in motion pictures of alcoholic beverages and tobacco. By the constant presentation of drinking and smoking on the screen the wholesome resistance of youth and childhood is being broken down.
November 14, 1942

NOTES TO THE FIELD 45
Drama is one of the cultural fields with which we have full sympathy and in which some of our organizations work extensively among the young people. We know of the immense influence of dramatic representation on the human mind. It is conceded that in some situations the use of tobacco and liquor might legitimately give a truer picture of life, although our own standards lead us to ban these articles from the stage. Incidentally, we have been pleased to see that plays do not suffer thereby. A talented group of professional and amateur players recently put on "The Man Who Came to Dinner," without smoking, drinking, profanity or vulgarity, and without lessening, strange as it may seem, the humor in the slightest. We know, therefore, that a great decrease in the use of tobacco and alcohol on the stage can be accomplished if there is the will to do it, and we earnestly petition you to set standards that will reduce these harmful things to the minimum. Although most states, perhaps all, have statutes forbidding the use of tobacco or alcoholic drinks by minors, yet whenever a drink is taken in a play, or cigarette lighted, especially by actors who represent to the young patrons almost everything desirable in life, a definite impact is made on their resistance to observe the law. The liquor and tobacco interests know the power of such example and of course do everything to extend the use of these articles in the business of the play. It is most unfortunate that the great institution of motion pictures, with its immeasurable educational and character forming influence, should be used to promote this evil. That is truly a breach of its great trust. Our responsibility to childhood and youth besides giving them the spiritual training to prepare them for eternal life, includes the endeavor to help them be healthy, temperate, upright and clean. Alcohol and tobacco, with their degenerative effects endanger both objectives. We commend you for all the fine things that you have donethe elimination of profanity, for example. And now in the name of our youth and of all American youth we appeal to you, who bear so much moral responsibility in this phase of our recreational life, to look into this situation and answer to your conscience as the good American that you are. We believe the wrong done to impressionable young people will tend to debauch individuals and bring about a poorer grade of American manhood and womanhood. Those who love America will support you in the action we plead with you to take.
