Lesson 7 Care of the Body as an Expression of Faith (Tuesday, April 6, 1943)
LATTER-DAY SAINTS attach great importance to the proper care of the body. No one can attain his highest usefulness, happiness, or intelligence, who injures his body by improper living. In the Doctrine and Covenants there are many revelations regarding the human body and its importance as an instrument of the mind. "The spirit and the body," we are informed, "are the soul of man." (Section 88:15) And in another place we read that the spirit manifests itself through the body. Therefore, the physical condition of the body either facilitates or hampers expression of the spirit. Such things as food, clothing, proper housing and living conditions
are "given to strengthen the body and enliven the soul." (Doctrine and Covenants 59:19) Section 88:124 gives instructions for the maintenance of the body. "Cease to be idle; cease to be unclean;... Cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated." Then there is the Word of Wisdom (Section 89), which offers specific instructions: tobacco, "strong or hot drinks," excessive meat eating are "not good for man;" while fruit in the season thereof is good for the use of man, and wheat is specially "for man." Obedience to these teachings is attended by certain blessings. There are also revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants which indicate that the care of the body is a religious duty. The attitude of the mind and the emotions one cultivates have an effect on the health of the body. This fact was enunciated by Jesus and it

finds ample justification, if any is needed, in what we know from the study of the body. Christ assures us that fear, anger, hate, with kindred emotions, are a source of injury. He puts it theologically: "Thou shalt not be angry with thy brother." But science gives us the reason. Says Herbert Spencer, in his Data of Ethics: "From biology we learn that no act should be committed or thought entertained which weakens the body, for thereby the human being is rendered unfit for the duties of life." Obedience to the laws of health, both those revealed through religion and those discovered by man in his search for truth, express our faith in the teachings of the Church so far as concerns the sanctity of the body.
