Your Heritage Dott J. Sartori First Prize
Here is a heritage, my new-born son: You have the blood of heroes in your veins. A thousand thousand threads of lives, once lived, Are passed and plaited into living skeins That merge through all the centuries in you. Your father's fire, his father's high unrest Crimson your arterial stream and gauge Your vision, set your span and depth of chest. And all the giants, ax in hand, who swung Down purple aisles of forest, all the brave Who pitted wit and brawn against their foes, Who loved and courted and conceived and gave Life out of life, have stored their powers in you.

Through unrecorded eras, dark and still, Remember, the stout of spirit, conquerors Of life and love shall fabricate your will. Perhaps a valiant Joshua will blow His mighty trumpets in your soul, my son, Or Moses speak in your integrity, Or Joseph's and your purity be one. Some faithful heart that knew the miracle At the parting of the Jordan, beats in yours. In your foot sandaled ancestors will stand Once more against the old conspirators.
