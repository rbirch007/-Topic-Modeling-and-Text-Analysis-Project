Introduction
Carlyle says: "There are great personalities who march through history with voices like clarion trumpets and something like glittering swords in their hands.... Contact with them warms and kindles the mind." By association with superior personalities, either in the flesh or through the medium of literature, we take on some of their greatness. Many people feel that the Bible has more eminent characters than any other book of literature. This is one of its claims to greatness. Frank S. Mead draws attention to this fact in his book 250 Bible Biographies. Henry T. Sell includes only twenty-one men in his Studies of Great Bible Characters, but his selection point definitely to outstanding men who have given us ideal and moral uplift by the ideals, struggles, and achievements of their own lives. He writes of Abraham, the man who dared to trust God; of Isaac, who accepted the challenge of obedience; of Joseph, the dreamer whose dreams came true; of Moses, the leader and law-giver of a nation; of Joshua, the courageous man with a hard task; of Saul, the man who abused his opportunities; of David, the self-conqueror who became king; of Job, the man of undeserved suffering; of Isaiah, the world prophet and statesman; of Daniel, the man who made advantage out of disadvantage; of Luke, the man who broadcasted the Gospel's good news; of Paul, the man who bettered city conditions; and many others. Mr. Sell describes his characters as men who were "the outstanding and strategic leaders in their own times, the men who molded the thought and directed the action of the ages
65
in which they lived, but who today are even more influential, for they realized, were profoundly influenced by, and worked enthusiastically for ideals and principles which still lead us on." They had their faults and made mistakes, for they were very human; but above every other desire, they had that of bringing the kingdom of God on earththis was their glory. We can learn from them today by seeing how they met their problems and worked them out. Mr. Sell says, "They were hardy adventurers on the sea of life who, despite violent storms, came safely to port with rich cargoes. To examine how they did this will richly repay our study, for in their successes they rise above their nationality and every age." Though Mr. Mead gives no more than his regular two or three hundred words to his thumb-nail sketch of Jesus, and Mr. Sell does not include Him at all, we know that both would give him first place among Biblical characters. Hundreds of books have been written upon His life and mission. Most of them have recognized His divinity, though a few have attempted to understand him as a man alone. Of such writers, Harry Emerson Fosdick says in The Modern Uses of the Bible, p. 272: "Of all foolish things, I think nothing is more foolish than, looking back over our race's history and discerning amid its tragedy and struggles this outstanding figure spiritually supreme, to minimize him, to tone down our thought of him, to reduce him so that we can be like him. Rather let us exalt him! If God be not in Jesus, God is not anywhere. The best hope of mankind is that God is in him and may flow down through all the secret runnels of the race." So important is the personality of Jesus that an entire lesson needs to be devoted to him. In this lesson we shall consider a few of the other Bible characters.
Abraham
That Abraham believed in God and trusted Him to the highest degree is seen in the sacrifice of Isaac. He probably felt as parents do today who sacrifice their sons for the good of their country. There is something of an analogy, too, in the willingness of parents in our Church to send their sons and daughters into strange lands to preach the Gospel. Often they realize that dangers will beset them, but they are proud to give them to the service of our Lord. Our Heavenly Father himself set the divine example, for "He so loved the world that he gave His only begotten Son." Of Abraham, William L. Phelps says, "Unlike most of the Old Testament heroes, hardly anything evil can be charged against him. He was spiritual-minded. He was obedient to the divine voice, and his unfaltering trust in God was rewarded." Mr. Sell says that Abraham stands out as a commanding figure; that he had the traits of character that make great leaders; that he had daring and splendid executive ability; that he was large-hearted and far-sighted and would have made an eminent statesman or victorious general had the opportunity come. Abraham was the founder of the Israelitish nation; his name is revered by Christians, Jews, and Mohammedans; he is still blessing mankind by making it easier for them to worship and love God and by showing them how to live uprightly under trying circumstances.
Moses
Moses was another genius, a leader at a critical period of Israelitish history. He was a lawgiver and a statesman; a guide to the Chosen People in Egypt and in the wilderness. Books have been written about Moses. Lectures have characterized him as the great Hebrew statesman. A scientist, calling him "Moses, the physician," has praised his advanced ideas concerning cleanliness and segregation of disease. He is depicted as gentle in manners, modest, and above all self-controlled, courageous, and strong. He has been classed as the "meekest" of menthe finest tribute to soldiers and kings. "The meek shall inherit the earth" suggests that there is no strength like the strength of meekness. Phelps says, "That Moses was the meekest man in ancient history, is the best thing said about him." The story of Moses' birth and concealment in the rushes is like the plot of a modern novel or movie. When Pharaoh's daughter named him, she did better than she knew, for Moses meant "drawer out," and he drew the Children of Israel out of slavery. His first act of which we have record was indicative of his later career as a deliverer. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, and he killed the Egyptian, though perhaps he knew he would be condemned by his own people, taunted and insulted, and branded as a murderer. Moses' best preparation for his
later leadership came to him unconsciously while he kept the flocks of his father-in-law. The quiet, meditative life of the desert shepherd brought him in close communion with God, who gave him the sign of the burning bush to make him aware of his call to leadership. To convince his people that he had been divinely called, Moses was permitted to do a number of impressive miracles, such as turning his rod into a snake, making his hand leprous, and then well and whole again. Later miracles, of course, were much more spectacular, when he was called to compete with the magicians of the king who were trying to subdue the Israelites. The story of the Ten Plagues has been called "a tragedy in ten acts ending with a climax." This story and other incidents in the life of this great man are well known. We need here, perhaps, only to remind ourselves that though he was born in slavery, he stands out as one of the greatest figures in the history of mankind, his chief accomplishment being that he took a people who had been in the worst type of slavery the world has ever known, and made it into a great nation with as pure moral and spiritual ideals as the world has ever known. Great characters in the Bible are not confined to men. Mr. Mead includes many women among his biographies, and Willard Done, of our own Church, wrote a little book entitled Women of the Bible. Among interesting fictional books based on Biblical characters is Mary Borden's Mary of Nazareth. In this lesson we shall consider briefly but one of the great women in the Bible.
67
Eve
Little has been written about Eve, and there is little in the scriptures directly concerning her. Yet she holds a unique position in being the first woman in the world. That Eve had the womanly qualities that have preserved for her daughters their place in the shrine of men's hearts through all succeeding ages is evidenced by Adam's first recorded utterances about her and his willingness to share her fall. He said: "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife: they shall be one flesh." (Genesis 2:24) Adam could have refused to partake of the forbidden fruit. He knew well the painful consequences. Condemned for her sin, Eve has been harshly called weak; she has been reproached as the agent through whom mankind fell. She doubtless was weak and failed to discriminate between vastly different values. But let us consider some of her other characteristics. She was highly sensitive to the beauties and glories in the Garden of Eden. She longed for the gifts her tempter promisedwisdom and understanding equal to that of the gods. These would add to her power to enjoy beauty. The serpent, we must remember, had also promised that she would not die. Doubtless, too, she wanted Adam to possess something of inestimable valuethe wisdom of the gods. We must remember that Eve had had no experience. She had not learned, as most of us have to learn, that disobedience brings punishment. The promise that she would know good from evil, that she would see as God, that she would not dieall these constituted so great a temptation that she could not resist it. But to understand the mature woman it is necessary to follow Eve's career outside the Garden of Eden. As Willard Done says: "The first family was founded and the first real home established when Eve exclaimed in triumph at the birth of Cain, 'I have gotten a man from the Lord!' For the first time in the world the miracle of human birth had been experienced; and Eve was the first to know all the pain and sorrow and joy and triumph it entailed.... The first mother had looked with joy on her first born. The crowning triumph of her life had come, worth the sacrifice even of such a place as Eden. "As Eve was the first to know the experience of human birth, so she was the first mother to endure the sorrow of death, and that in its most terrible form, the murder of one of her sons by the other. It seems to have been her lot to sound all the depths and reach all the heights of woman's experience, "as if she had been destined to be an exemplar to her descendants by passing through all the joys, sorrows, glories, and humiliations that woman can know. Into her life were crowded the events which fulfilled the pronouncement following the fall.... To lose her first two sons, one by violent death and the other by the punishment of exile, was to sound the lowest depths of grief and humiliation. It is difficult to conceive of a greater sorrow. In her endurance of this bitterness, Eve proved herself again the heroine we have always thought her to be. And as so often happens in our griefs, the great loss was made up to her. Another son, Seth, was given her to fill, in part, the places left vacant by the murder of Abel and the exile of Cain. "And so Eve fought her fight and filled her place as the first wife and mother.... To have been the first woman, realizing in her long and eventful life all the experiences of womanhood and earning all its rewards, was to accomplish in its fullness the mission of her sex. No greater appreciation of Eve or higher praise for her work can be given." We cannot help wondering if Eve ever had the joy of foreseeing that through a far-off descendant would come one to redeem the world. That vision, could she have foreseen the coming of Christ from her posterity, would have been a comfort and support to her through the years. Mary, the mother of Jesus, will be presented in the next lesson.

Social Science What "America" Means
Lesson 7 Growth of Political Parties in America (Tuesday, April 27, 1943)
"He serves his party best, who serves his country best." Rutherford B. Hayes
"A thing to be remembered by every man who wishes to make his influence felt for good in our politics is that he must act purely as an American.... If we wish to do good work for our country, we must be unselfish, disinterested, sincerely desirous of the well-being of the commonwealth, and capable of a devoted adherence to a lofty ideal." Theodore Roosevelt
WHEN George Washington was elected President of the United States in 1789, there were no political parties. At the beginning of the Revolutionary War, the people had divided into Whigs and Tories, or Patriots and Loyalists, but the result of the war had been final, and during the discussion and ratification of the Constitution of the United States, there had been Federalists and Anti-Federalists; the adoption of the Constitution, however, seemed to end the existence of the latter. Nevertheless, there were groups and cleavages from which parties would arise in time. There were the frontier and the settled states along the Atlantic seaboard; the rich and the poor; the agricultural and commercial classes; those who believed in a strong central government and those who stood for the fullest possible sovereignty of the different states; those who believed that the Constitution should be interpreted as strictly as possible and those who wished to give its clauses the widest possible interpretation. But on April 30, 1789, when the inauguration of Washington occurred, there were no party organizations. Washington thus had a clear field from which to make his appointments, and he believed that the presidency should not be a partisan office. When President Washington organized his cabinet, among the prominent men that he called to office were Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, the former becoming Secretary of State and the latter, Secretary of the Treasury. In the different political theories of these two men, one discovers the cleavages from which our two great modern political partiesRepublican and Democratarose. No two men could have been more different, both in character and in views as to what government should be in the newly organized nation. Hamilton was born in the West Indies and as a young boy landed in New York with his fortune to make. He studied law and married into a wealthy New York family and became a leading figure in the state. He had a brilliant mind and an attractive personality. Jefferson was born on the frontier in Virginia. While Hamilton lived among the moneyed classes of New York, Jefferson was influenced by the people of the country life. He had complete faith in the wisdom of what we call "the common man." Hamilton believed in a strong central government, while Jefferson believed that government should be left to the people within their respective states as far as possible. Hamilton stood for a high protective tariff, a tax to protect the manufacturing industries of America. Jefferson believed that the tax or tariff on foreign goods made articles more expensive, and he radically opposed any tax on foreign goods. One can readily see that three great problems soon confronted the American people. They were: (1) Shall negro slavery be eliminated? (2) Shall a high protective tariff be maintained on imported goods? (3) Do the individual states have rights and powers over and above those granted by the Federal Government? Along these lines the American people took sides, and were grouped principally in two political camps, which eventually emerged into our major parties of today. The political parties of our national history grew out of the devergent geographical conditions of the country, for these conditions were conducive of conflicting economic or industrial interests. Cold winters and poor rock soil made most of the area of New England unsuited to extensive agriculture, but the abundant water power, proximity to the raw products of the West, and the skilled labor which that section always had, gave it extensive commercial and industrial advantages. After the War of 1812, aided by a high protective tariff, the industrial development of New England was rapid.. On the other hand, geographical conditions in the South were most favorable to the development of agticulture. The Southern people always complained that the tariff laws of the Government not only restricted trade in the South, but increased the price of manufactured goods. Then, too, the cotton indus-. Try of the Southern States fostered the growth of negro slavery, an institution which the Northern States came to abhor. Each section, therefore, was eager for political power, and during the years from 1780, when our Government was organized, down to the Civil War (1861- 1865), great statesmen lived to fight courageously for the political ideals which they held to be right. Such men were Daniel Webster, John C. Calhoun, Henry Clay, Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, Stephen A. Douglas, Jefferson Davis, and many others. It has been said that "the history of political parties in America  LESSON DEPARTMENT is a history of great statesmen, who though differing with their colleagues stood' shoulder to shoulder in demanding that they be in very truth Americans." BRIEF survey will help the reader to understand the history of the two major parties in our political development. From Thomas Jefferson's administration (1801-9) to 1825, the Democratic-Republicans were in power. 'They followed pretty much the policies of Jefferson. In 1825, this party dropped the name Republican, and took the name of Jacksonian Democrats, after Andrew Jackson. A new party was formed to oppose Jackson, which in 1830 took the name of Whigs. From 1830 to 1850, when slavery, states rights, and the tariff became 'bones of contention, the Whig Party gradually grew in power, and out of it came the Republican Party, which elected Abraham Lincoln in 1860. The differences between the interests of the Southern States and those of the Northern States were partly settled by the War of the Rebellion, and since the restoration of the nine 'states which seceded in 1861, there has steadily grown a better understanding of peoples living in different sections of our country. Since the Civil War, the most important phase of the development of our country has been our widespread activities in industry, which have revolutionized manufacturing, agriculture, transportation, and mining. A great machine age has changed our social lives. The power supplied by man's muscle or by that of his domestic animals has been supplemented by steam, electricity, and 7) gasoline. The use of this power aided in the production of great wealth, for manufacturing plants grew in size and were consolidated into larger industries. Trusts were organized; and, because of their tendency to monopolize the industries, the Government found it necessary to attempt legislation. In the larger factories, thousands of laborers were employed, each of whom was engaged in some detailed process of production in which expensive machinery was used. This caused the control of industry to pass from the hands of the worker and led labor to organize. Following the war between the North and the South, high tariffs have enabled great industrial corporations to develop more rapidly. Organized labor sought to increase wages, reduce hours of employment, and secure better sanitary conditions. Here you have the foundation for the differences of opinion between capital and labor. We learn a useful lesson in the study of political parties in our national history. Every man who wishes well of his country is in honor bound to take an active interest in political life. A man who wishes to do good in his community may do so by going into active political life. One can always find men who are desirous of good government, and who if they act together, become at once a power on the side of righteousness. One word more. It concerns our present problems. The present is an introduction to the future. A present problem left unsolved will ripen into a future crisis. With nearly all the world ablaze, it will require the American people to give to their country a united support in conquering those powers that are determined to destroy all that is sacred and secure in our democracy. Questions and Topics for Discussion Note: An ordinary manual or onevolume history of the United States will give brief information on the history of political parties. In your class work, talk over some of the important subjects suggested in this lesson. They are: 1. Why were the American people practically united in their social and political lives at the time of the American Revolution? 2. While there were no political parties at the time of Washington's election to the presidency, discuss the lines of political thought as expressed in the lives of Hamilton and Jefferson. 3. Give all the reasons you can why the Southern States were different from the Northern States in industry, social life, and political thought up to the time of the Civil War. 4. It has been said that the political history of a nation may be studied in the lives of the nation's great political characters. Explain this saying. 5. Find out something about the minor parties that have influenced something of our history; for example, The Prohibition Party, the Know-Nothing Party, the Progressive or Bull Moose Party. 6. On what great issue was Abraham Lincoln elected to the presidency of the United States? 7. Since the Civil War, how has America changed in its industrial, social, and political history?
