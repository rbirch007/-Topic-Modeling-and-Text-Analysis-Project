DOTT J. SARTORI BEATRICE KNOWLTON EKMAN
Your Heritage Dott J. Sartori First Prize
Here is a heritage, my new-born son: You have the blood of heroes in your veins. A thousand thousand threads of lives, once lived, Are passed and plaited into living skeins That merge through all the centuries in you. Your father's fire, his father's high unrest Crimson your arterial stream and gauge Your vision, set your span and depth of chest. And all the giants, ax in hand, who swung Down purple aisles of forest, all the brave Who pitted wit and brawn against their foes, Who loved and courted and conceived and gave Life out of life, have stored their powers in you.

Through unrecorded eras, dark and still, Remember, the stout of spirit, conquerors Of life and love shall fabricate your will. Perhaps a valiant Joshua will blow His mighty trumpets in your soul, my son, Or Moses speak in your integrity, Or Joseph's and your purity be one. Some faithful heart that knew the miracle At the parting of the Jordan, beats in yours. In your foot sandaled ancestors will stand Once more against the old conspirators.
While the Earth Turns Beatrice Knowlton Ekman Second Prize
I The canyon's clefted walls are torched with flame Of maplescarlet vying sumach-red; The yellowed cottonwoods and alders frame The creek and swale. In silence overhead Swift-moving banks of gray mingle with mist That veils the hills with mauve and amethyst. The quaking aspens hold their branches high And tinkle castanets in lullaby. The scarlet and the yellow leaves will fall To rust beneath the drip of slanting rain, While hill-pines to the soughing ridge-pines call. To seek the sheltering evergreens again, Furred creatures under bare, bleak trees will go, Their footprints etched in moonlight on the snow.
II The dirt road rims the mountainside; The creek makes murmurings below Where over rocks, cool waters glide Tumbling in white and crystal flow. The skies are cupped in sober gray On kneeling hills of camel-brown
PRIZE-WINNING POEMS 13

And on blue summits far away Winter has laid white sandals down. After the night of cleansing rain The mountain trees stand still and stark, The old trails beckoning in vain Up through the groves of silver bark. With somberness of earth and sky November days are set apart I hear a late bird's lonely cry And grief unbidden stirs my heart.
III The fields we loved to wander through Have faded to a graver hue, And where we watched the barley blow Red pheasants glean the stubble row. Unfettered from the sloping hill, Where painted trees their crimson spill, The tumbleweeds come marshaling down The hillside road that runs to town. Through long uncharted lanes of sky Wild geese in patterned wedges fly, And wheeling earth brings darkbrings dawn Only my heart knows you are gone.
Symphony of the Snow Linda S. Fletcher Third Prize
Allegro Artists' hands have opened up, And floating from them down to earth Comes Pavlova, with her ballet, In a dainty dance of mirth. Swirling, whirling on tiptoe, Silent as the stars' chorale, Sylphs glide on, to strains unheard The melody of gay snowfall.
Allegretto On they pass; the tempo now Changes, while Cellinis trim The setmold ghostly Spring On trees. A-down waft seraphim With jeweled coverlet to veil A man-scarred world from scrutiny Of Heaven's facethus hide, awhile A desolating agony.
Andante For a brief moment earth again Knows Edeninnocence and peace; The heaped-up mounds consigned to dust Are covered o'er; the clangors cease. In the white sky an unseen host Joins in a requiem sublime To mark the groaning world's travail On the Eternal's tome of time.
Coda Earth soon will know the end of woe, When clad in amaranthine bloom, Her purity like to the snow, She ne'er again will hold a tomb!
EXCERPT FROM "HOW CLIMATE MAKES THE MAN"
"...People in the tropics seldom wear out or break down; they die largely from infectious and parasitic diseases. "In temperate coolness it is a breakdown in our combustion machinery which is bringing greatest worry to the medical profession. This involves particularly the heart and blood vessels, since on them falls the direct load of transporting food and oxygen to the body tissues and of removing the waste products and useless heat. Heart failure is predominantly a problem of cool climates. "Energetic Northerners thus should regard stress of life as a major danger and health hazard, especially after passing the forty-year mark. They should be careful about increasing the stress upon body machinery by lack of proper sleep and relaxation or through the use of caffeine which makes every tissue in the body work harder. I personally feel that overuse of this drug (the active principle of coffee, tea, and cola beverages) is today doing more damage among the active Americans of middle temperate latitudes than any other single factor in life. Over-use of tobacco probably runs a close second."
