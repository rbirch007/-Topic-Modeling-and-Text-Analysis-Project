While the Earth Turns Beatrice Knowlton Ekman Second Prize
I The canyon's clefted walls are torched with flame Of maplescarlet vying sumach-red; The yellowed cottonwoods and alders frame The creek and swale. In silence overhead Swift-moving banks of gray mingle with mist That veils the hills with mauve and amethyst. The quaking aspens hold their branches high And tinkle castanets in lullaby. The scarlet and the yellow leaves will fall To rust beneath the drip of slanting rain, While hill-pines to the soughing ridge-pines call. To seek the sheltering evergreens again, Furred creatures under bare, bleak trees will go, Their footprints etched in moonlight on the snow.

And on blue summits far away Winter has laid white sandals down. After the night of cleansing rain The mountain trees stand still and stark, The old trails beckoning in vain Up through the groves of silver bark. With somberness of earth and sky November days are set apart I hear a late bird's lonely cry And grief unbidden stirs my heart.
III The fields we loved to wander through Have faded to a graver hue, And where we watched the barley blow Red pheasants glean the stubble row. Unfettered from the sloping hill, Where painted trees their crimson spill, The tumbleweeds come marshaling down The hillside road that runs to town. Through long uncharted lanes of sky Wild geese in patterned wedges fly, And wheeling earth brings darkbrings dawn Only my heart knows you are gone.
