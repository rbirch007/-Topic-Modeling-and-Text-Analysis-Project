SUPERFINE Elsie E. Barrett
My mem'ry box is not as strong As once it was; The lid seems warped, the hinges rusted At three-score-ten it can't be trusted. Is age the cause?
Now there's no sense in letting Years Dictate and fill that box with fears Of growing old. I'll face about and calmly say: "Not quite so fast, you're in the way; You are too bold;
And don't you dare to leave a creak, An ache or pain or even squeak In any joint of mine. There's so much work for me to do: I can't be bothered yet with you; I'm superfine!"
