How Grownup Are You In Your Attitude Toward the War? Mark K. Allen, Psychologist, Utah State Training School
THE great reservoir of human nervous energy within us, is, of all the vast resources of our nation, undoubtedly the most precious. Unfortunately, it is often the most carelessly squandered unwittingly. What are some of the common ways we waste this energy? How do our opponents attempt to dissipate this precious resource? How can we preserve it best for the national good? Most adults, though they have reached mature stature, have not put away all childish attitudes. These immature attitudes carried into adult life waste vital nervous energy. Because a temper tantrum in a child is wasteful of his nervous energy, and that of others, we try to teach him the more efficient habit of cooperation with others. The difficulties almost everyone experiences in adjusting socially under relatively normal conditions are a measure of his emotional maturity. Under the severe stress of the war emergency, all of one's inefficient wayshis personality maladjustments or childish attitudesbecome more apparent. Bad dispositions may become worse under stress; an unhappy marriage adjustment may grow intolerable; the poor homemaker may come upon even harder days. All of our childish tendenciesblaming others, grumbling over inconveniences, for exampleshow up in our general inadequacy to make a happy and wholesome adjustment to the emergency. We pointed out in a previous ar-

ticle how enemy propaganda is calculated to waste our energies through creating fears, confusion, and class feelings among ourselves. Fears and confusion which smolder but do not lead to positive action are extremely wasteful of our energies. Bombings and destruction are aimed at wasting the energies of the people, as well as material resources. Think of the man-hours of labor wasted through the time and worry spent by workers in air raid shelters alone. Blockade and destruction of food supplies is another vicious weapon aimed at wasting energy through hunger and malnutrition. Fears flourish more rapidly in the presence of fatigue and hunger. So our opponents hope for us to waste our reservoir of nervous energy through fear, confusion, class hatred, fatigue, and malnutrition. Our opponents have made no secret of their hope and belief that the American people will not endure the hardships of war. They do not doubt that we have tremendous natural resources, but they do doubt our willingness to revise quickly our indulgent habits. Japanese leaders have spoken pointedly of the "spoiled child" mentality of the Americans, claiming that good living has made us soft. It was no accident that cutting off almost all of the rubber supplies we enjoyed was one of the first objects of the Japanese military campaign. We are just beginning to realize the sacrifice that stratagem requires of all of us. Japan is confident we "can't take it" without wasting our energies through whining and resentment. Of course, our task today is to show how badly our opponents have misjudged the ability of the average American to adapt to his difficulties.
HOW GROWNUP ARE YOU?
There are many special conditions incident to our war effort which will cause further waste in our energies. These conditions affect all of us in varying degrees today, and they are likely to become more serious as the war continues. They challenge the emotional maturity of all of us. First, there are innumerable inconveniences and annoyances which interfere with our habitual way of living. There are many shortages of goods that are more annoying than directly vital to existence: sugar, metal goods of all kinds, silk, and especially rubber and transportation facilities. The nervous exhaustion over these small matters is often more than over major affairs, Adolph Myers, eminent psychiatrist, tells us. How sensibly we adapt to these matters is a good indication of how grownup we are. Our government's relation to us in these regulations is like that of parents to their children in matters of everyday discipline. But since we as adults are so accustomed to not being strictly regulated, we have some painful habit revision to undergo. These annoyances call upon us for a mature and patient forbearance. The plumber fails us, resulting in all degrees of serious consequences; the clerks at the stores are inexperienced; deliveries to our homes are rapidly becoming unavailable at a time when we can drive our automobiles to only a very limited extent.

The telephone service for civilians is greatly reduced in efficiency, domestic help is almost unobtainable. Tradesmen of all kinds are becoming very independent in serving us. Many of the consumer goods we are able to buy are of inferior quality. All of these daily annoyances add up to a considerable waste of one's vital energies, if we permit them toas our opponents hope we will. Most of us can find a simple salvation from these annoyances and shortages by remembering that "misery loves company." When all women must wear hose not so sheer and lovely, perhaps no one will feel so badly. Business failure in a depression is not so painful as during prosperity, because we have plenty of company in our misery. Already we humorously measure social status, not by noting how new one's automobile is, but by looking at one's tires to see how many miles he still can go. The pain of minor deprivations is largely social. When we are all affected more or less alike, we may even see something amusing in the struggle of millions of people over their little misfortunes. Then there are the shortages just apparent on the horizon which are a more serious foreboding. Some essential foods are becoming dangerously scarce; and while we in America are not seriously threatened with famine, we may undergo some genuine hardships before many months. Meat and dairy products are already threatened. Fuel shortages already have many a household shivering. The acute housing shortage in defense areas is definitely more serious than the annoyances mentioned above. Limited medical and hospital facilities are already entering the acute stage in some rural and "boom" communities. These conditions may necessitate severe sacrifices and much mature resourcefulness in adjusting to them. Malnutrition from actual shortages has not affected us seriously so far. But one wonders how much systematic undernourishment of workers and children is resulting from both parents working, and the general disorder of family life from many causes. Added to the strain of work in many cases is the strain of much time spent in traveling to and from work. All of the energy output should be carefully calculated to determine whether one is utilizing his energies in the best possible manner. In many ways our disorganized way of living today draws heavily upon our nervous energies. The adjustments we must make to a variety of new conditions, from being separated from our loved ones in service to learning a new skill and adapting to a new job, draw heavily on our energy reserves in imperceptible ways. Our children are also making adjustments to new neighbors among whom we move or who move among us. Workers of all kinds from farmers to teachers are confronted with difficult new conditions. Newly increased income itself brings new problems of budgeting. By some of us, foolish spending is indulged in even beyond the excessive incomes. Then follows a succession of worries about meeting obligations. Many people are learning that large incomes bring headaches as well as joys. The problems of any member of a family draw to some extent upon the energies of the others, but so are the new joys shared in a similar manner. And there are many compensating experiences in the present emergency. Some people are for the first time in their lives feeling useful in a great cause. For the first time in many years, they are getting out of debt. Many are now enjoying a more bounteous living than ever before. For some, this new sense of mastery is an invitation to dissipative living, which is usually most wasteful of one's energy reserves. Others are soberly conserving themselves and their substance for living in the better world they believe will dawn tomorrow.
FROM all we have said of the new conditions of today which draw heavily upon our nervous energies, what are some of the common immature adjustments adults are liable to make? We may resort to the device of projecting our annoyances upon some convenient scapegoat. Usually an adult's loved ones in the home are the most convenient objects. Fatigued as a parent often is, he or she often fails to discern the true sources of his annoyances. But the family may not be especially receptive to the bad humor of any of its members, considering their own special annoyances these days. It is childish, needless to say, for an adult to victimize others when he is annoyed or tired. Another immature reaction is for parents to refuse to safeguard their own health and welfare. Fathers and mothers, like their children, often refuse to be governed by ordinary good judgment about proper nourishment, rest, and change.

Blaming the government for causing shortages and confusion by mismanagement is a third kind of reaction. Aside from the question of the validity of these complaints, the question is whether this is a mature and sensible reaction. One's congressman might be able to help out if requested; but our neighbor usually does nothing but become infected with our complaints, which he takes up only because they nurse his annoyances. Evasions and "chiseling" are a fourth kind of immature reaction, often associated with grumbling about the government. The task of regulating the flow of materials to civilians is extremely complicated and has been done in great haste to meet emergencies. Many loopholes can be found by those who look for them. Many people do not realize that this is their war, and the successful management of the materials to win it depends upon the individual patriotism of every Americannot just "the other fellow." Rationing regulations depend for their success on our ability to police ourselves. Grownup Americans comply even when they know "no one is looking." Unfortunately, the people who conform conscientiously to regulations are often penalized for the evasions of others. The "chiselers" are likely to fail to see that their noncompliance to regulations is a cause of great waste of energy through the irritation and resentment aroused in the conscientious. Our opponents count on our being spoiled children when it comes to giving up our liberty to do as we please about these things. A fifth immature reaction to which

we may fall victim has to do with our race prejudices. Perhaps there is no reaction more difficult to make in a sensible manner than that toward enemy nationals. Much vital energy is wasted in hating enemy nationals in a way that can accomplish no good purpose. Who, then, is the mature American? In our character sketch, we would say that he is the person who 1. Has a sense of humor which overrides shortages and annoyances and who experiences a deep patriotic emotion in helping win the war through a host of "little things." 2. He works hard for victory at the tasks he can do best; but he doesn't have to be scolded about taking proper nourishment, rest, recreation. 3. He puts his surplus funds into government bonds, rather than wasting them on foolish spending, finally arriving at the short end of installment buying. 4. He has a sense of relative values between overtime and high pay and the welfare of his family his health, and his ultimate productiveness to the war effort. 5. He does not spread resentment to others through complaining about government regulations. He advises his congressman of his well considered criticism. 6. He doesn't take advantage of loopholes in government regulations. He is his own policeman. 7. He believes in the ultimate triumph of democratic ideals and indulges in no hysterical national hatreds which may make national enemies of enemy nationals among us; but he has intelligent patriotism which harnesses hatred and deals death blows where they can defeat the enemy.
