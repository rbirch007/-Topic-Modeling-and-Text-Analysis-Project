George D. Pyper Milton Bennion Superintendent of the Deseret Sunday School Union, passed away January 16, 1943. Funeral services were held in the Assembly Hall on Temple Square, in Salt Lake City, on January 19. All members of the First Presidency, the majority of the General Authorities, the Sunday School Union Board, and a host of friends and admirers of Superintendent Pyper were in attendance. Brother Pyper had been an xecutive officer of the Sunday School Union Board for more than forty years. He had also served the Church, the state, and the local community in many other capacities. He was endowed with very superior artistic abilities but his artistic interests and attainments in nowise curtailed his business and administrative abilities. This was manifested in his long and successful term, as manager of the Salt Lake Theatre and in his management of numerous pageants, musical and dramatic performances, and publications, many of which he either wrote or edited. (Guaeen D. PYPER, General In his youth and early manhood he served as clerk and later as judge of the Salt Lake City police court. This experience induced him to study law. These studies were, however, interrupted by a call to an extensive missionary tour in the company of Elders B. H. Roberts and Melvin J. Ballard. Numerous subsequent calls by both Church and state to important positions prevented Brother Pyper from resuming his legal studies. ELDER GEORGE D. PYPER To his intimate associates he was best known as a courteous, kind, sympathetic, and understanding friend; he was, indeed, a friend of man. While he was deeply religious, there was in him no trace of the pharisaical attitude so frequently denounced by Jesus. While he attended to all the details of the precepts of the Church, he emphasized the "weightier matters of the law"  justice, kindness, and integrity. His character was, in fact, the embodiment of these virtues. He had ever in mind the greatest of all the commandmentsthe love of God; this he expressed in the love and service of his fellow men. When they were in trouble they came to him for assistance with assurance that this assistance would be given to the limit of his ability. Page 93
