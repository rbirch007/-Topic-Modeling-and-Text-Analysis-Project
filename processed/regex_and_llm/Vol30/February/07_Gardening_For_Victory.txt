Gardening for Victory Hazel D. Moyle Garden Editor, The Deseret News
To my garden let us raise Daughters of Jove, a song of praise! Orchard of unfailing fruit, Grape and apple, herb and root, Of all the wealth that gardens give Whereby man may eat and live. Here, in fellowship, agree Pleasure and utility.
THUS did the ancient poet Asinius, celebrate in verse the praises of home gardeningand today, almost two thousand years later, gardens again have become important contributors toward the pleasure, safety, and comfort of family and national life. The 1943 home garden will play an important role in our country's mighty program of war, for gardeners too have been called to arms, but our weapons will be the digging fork and the hoe. We must polish off these trusty weapons and prepare to plant as never before; we must make every small bit of earth in our possession produce "all the wealth that gardens give whereby man may eat and live." We must not only raise flowers, but fruits and vegetables as well, for food, we are told, will play a leading part in winning victory. Every row of carrots or tomatoes we can raise and use at our family table will mean just that much more food for our boys on the fighting fronts throughout the world. Our country must produce tremendous quantities of extra food this year to send to our Allies as well as the starving millions of the war ridden earth. And every home gardener must accept the call, and should soon be at

work preparing plans for an all out Victory Garden. The home owner who has vacant ground which lies out in full sun and can be reached by water, can make an important contribution toward our victory, for such a piece of land can easily supply fresh vegetables for an entire familynot only the essential potatoes, onions, beets, and carrots, but many other less familiar and equally desirable additions to our daily bill of fare. Vegetables give us one of the finest sources of the all important vitamins, and we must cultivate a taste for new and untried varieties to help add both valuable food and variety to our meals. The owner of the ordinary city lot can also find space for growing vegetables. This was amply demonstrated in Salt Lake City gardens last season when flowers and vegetables were combined, to the enjoyment and gain of many home gardeners. It was plainly demonstrated that there is no need to dig up existing flower gardens, lawns, or shrubberies in order to have vegetables. One enthusiastic garden lover converted a small space at the rear of her home into a combined vegetable and flower garden where she planted rows of vegetables and edged them with annuals, gladioluses and dahlias. Tomatoes and cucumbers were trained on trellises at the rear where they not only made charming backgrounds, but produced fruits of finer flavor, color, and size, than those allowed to grow in the usual mannersprawling on the ground.
GARDENING FOR VICTORY
Currant, raspberry, and blackberry bushes were also planted as shrubs, making handsome foliage plants while at the same time supplying their delicious fruitsnote that each of these does well in shady spots. Almost every garden can find room for growing a few bushes to contribute their fine fruits for the table. Everbearing strawberries were also used in this bounteous garden to give a colorful edging and to provide the owner with this toothsome delicacy from late June until November, while the grapevines that had been set out earlier to make a charming arbor over the entrance to the garden, bore more than a bushel of grapes. Planted two years ago, this small space now produces the year's supply of vegetables for an entire family with some to spare for neighbors and friends, all produced in a space no larger than many that are lying vacant and waste behind the garage on many home properties. Not only does this versatile garden spot give a bounteous crop of eatables, but it also supplies quantities of flowers for all occasions, not to mention the renewed good health and enjoyment derived from its making by its mistress. There are some home gardeners, however, who find no unused spaces for such a venture. Nevertheless, it is quite possible to find room, right among the flower beds, where many kinds of vegetables will thrive. For instance, carrots, beets, lettuce, and parsley make good looking edging plants, and by planting them in front of taller growing flowers in sunny and open parts of the garden, they not only are decorative,

but they supply plenty of vitamins. Do not, however, seed your entire spaces at once, but plant a few short rows at a time, then add other plantings at two-week intervals, thus supplying yourself with a constant source of tender young crisp carrots and beets from early summer until late November. Unless the family is a large one, it is best to make small sowings often so that the crop will not all mature at once. Early radishes can be planted right out among the perennials on the very first day of springlong before the unused ground can be dug and prepared for planting. They will thrive and mature very quickly in the well worked and enriched soil of the flower beds, and will be eaten long before the flowers get really started into active growth. Radishes grow to perfection in earliest spring, and successive sowings can be made for several weeks right in the flower beds in any small vacant spots. Last season several city gardeners even boasted of the tender ears of corn that were raised in the sunny open parts of their flower gardens, making bold and handsome background plants, while one Salt Lake City matron won praise and prizes with the tomatoes which she grew among the aristocratic blooms of her rose garden, the two seemed to get along right well together. Green kale was another vegetable which was used to make a decorative planting, but which also proved unusually successful as an added and toothsome green for the dinner table. This bears handsome curly green leaves, and tastes oh, so good when served cooked like spinach or for soups or salads! And several gardeners set out pepper plants, both the green and the vivid red variety, in open sunny spots among the flowers with the best of results. Pole beans were also found to be easily grown and most profitable, furnishing a long season of good eating, and making very good tall plants for the rear. These need a stout stake upon which to climb, while the bush varieties make low bushy plants for any dry sunny corner, and bear fresh pods during the entire summer if kept picked. It should be remembered that all vegetables need and must have sun and plenty of air. Do not expect them to thrive in shady places. Cultivate the soil as soon as each kind germinates, and continue this attention if you wish them to develop well. This not only keeps weeds down, but conserves moisture, and produces excellent crops of high quality flavor. In fact, if you have never enjoyed strictly fresh vegetables, fresh from the garden to the pot, then you have a real thrill in store, for nothing is more delicious eating than really fresh young vegetables. You will find new flavor in every kind you grow. But we must also say a word for flowers, for these too will be important in the Victory Garden. We will need their sweet charms to comfort and bring cheer amid all the turmoil, and yes, perhaps the sorrows of wartime. Nothing has been found that will speak the message of love and courage so eloquently as a flower. We will need our flower gardens in which to work and find the peace and tranquility which is so lacking in the rest of the world. Wartime means little in a flower gardeneach flower goes its own sweet and mysterious way, blooming as punctually and as sweetly as usual no matter how chaotic the world may be. Here alone, all is orderly and calmthe sounds of turmoil only a distant hum. Here, without pang one sees Ranks, conditions and degrees. We must keep up our lawns, even though they are but tiny plots of green, and we must not neglect our shrubs, our flower beds, and our sheltering trees. We will need them as never before to help our morale during these trying times. We must cling to them as part of our way of life. Here is safetypeace and love attend you Here by the lattice along the wall The very trees stretch out green arms, as though they would defend you. "The Garden," Henri de Regnier.
