Theology and Testimony "Articles of Faith" By James E. Talmage
Lesson 16 Revelation: Past, Present, and Future (Tuesday, May 4, 1943)
Condensation of Chapter 16 of Articles of Faith, by Talmage
Article 9"We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God."
Revelation and Inspiration
In a theological sense the term revelation signifies the making known of divine truth by communication from the heavens. Divine revelation may consist of disclosures or declarations concerning the attributes of Deity, or of an expression of the will of God regarding the affairs of men. Divine inspiration may be regarded as a lower or less directly intensive operation of spiritual influence upon man than is shown in revelation.
Communication From God To Man
It is a privilege of the Holy Priesthood to commune with the heavens, and to learn the immediate will of the Lord; this communion may be effected through the medium of dreams and visions, by Urim and Thummim, through the visitation of angels, or by higher endowment of face to face communication with the Lord.
Revelation In Ancient Times
The patriarchs and prophets from Adam on down, including Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Joshua, through the Judges to David and Solomon, thence to John who was the forerunner of the Messiah, were blessed with the gift of revelation in varying degrees.
Christ Himself Was a Revelator
Notwithstanding His personal authority, God though He had been and was, while Jesus Christ lived as a man among men He declared His work to be that of One greater than Himself, by whom He had been sent and from whom He received instructions.

The Apostles Likewise Revelators
The Apostles, left to bear the burden of the Church after the departure of the Master, looked to heaven for guidance, expected and received the word of revelation to direct them in their exalted ministry.
Current Revelation Necessary
Revelation from God to man has been a vital characteristic of the living Church and is essential to the Church.
Alleged Objections in Scripture
Attempts to refute the doctrine of continued revelation by quoting certain passages of scripture are pitiably futile; they carry their own refutation, and leave untouched the truth that belief in current revelation is wholly reasonable and strictly scriptural.
Latter-day Revelation
The scriptures, far from asserting a cessation of revelation in latter times, expressly declare the restoration and latter-day operation of that gift.
Revelation Yet Future
The canon of scripture is still open; many lines, many precepts, are yet to be added; revelation, surpassing in importance and glorious fullness any that has been recorded, is yet to be given to the Church and declared to the world.
LESSON PLAN
Lesson Aim: To show that the Lord has spoken, is speaking, and yet shall speak for the direction and guidance of His children.
Suggested Material Outline
I. Distinction between inspiration and revelation "... I would place first and foremost the duty of seeking unto the Lord our God until we open the path of communication from heaven to earthfrom God to our own souls. Keep every avenue of your hearts clear and pure before Him." (Discourses of Brigham Young, p. 63) A. Inspiration
1. The Spirit enlightens every one in the world
2. The Holy Ghost is given to those who are baptized into the Church of Christ
3. Light and truth may come to those who seek its guidance B. Revelation
4. For personal benefit
5. For benefit of Church
6. How it may be given (See Articles of Faith Chapter 16, "Communication from God to Man.")
II. The Latter-day Saint view of revelation logical "The Bible is a record of a people's religious experience.
Through its entire history, spanning a score of centuries, revelation of God's will to man through His servants was the vitalizing element of that religion. In fact, the revelation of God's will, or the discovery by the prophets of God's will is the central theme of the record. The Christian world accepts that as a matter of course. Is a continuation of that vitalizing element in religion unreasonable? Joseph Smith's announcement of communion with God in the Sacred Grove, and elsewhere, is entirely in harmony with hundreds of similar experiences recorded in the accepted Christian Bible." (See also Discourses of Brigham Young, pp. 57-58.) A. Doctrine of continued revelation is reasonable B. Doctrine of continued revelation is scriptural

(See II Nephi 28:29-30; and 29:6-12; and Doctrine and Covenants 11:25.)
III. Revelation essential to existence of the true Church A. New circumstances demand new enlightenment B. Insures an authorized ministry in the Church C. Provides guidance to Church officers in their Church administrations
IV. What the doctrine of continued revelation to the Church means to you individually A. Ability of the Church to meet changing conditions B. Instills faith to meet trials C. Belief in God's omnipotence
Suggested Method Outline
Two class members might be assigned in advance to treat the two topics in the outline, "Inspiration" and "Revelation." The quotation from Brigham Young's Discourses might be used as an opening point of contact at the beginning of the lesson. Following are statements which might be discussed during the presentation of the lesson: 1. Show that inspiration does not deprive man of his freedom or individuality. 2. Cite the principal objections, professedly founded on scripture, to the doctrine of continued revelation. 3. What is known of God's revelations to Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses? The last topic of the outline makes a splendid opening for the bearing of testimonies by the women.
