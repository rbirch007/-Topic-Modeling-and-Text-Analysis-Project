Lucy Mack Smith
THE Magazine presents as its frontispiece a black and white copy of a colored drawing of Lucy Mack Smith, mother of the Prophet Joseph Smith. The colored drawing, in size about fifteen by twenty-four inches, was presented to the Relief Society by Elder George Albert Smith at the meeting of the Relief Society General Board held Wednesday, January 13, 1943. The circumstances surrounding the discovery of this valuable picture are very interesting. In September 1942, Elder George Albert Smith, in company with Elder Preston Nibley, stopped off on their way West to visit Nauvoo, Illinois, and nearby places connected with Church history. After visiting in Carthage, the brethren traveled thirteen miles to Colchester to call on the only living grandchild of Lucy Mack Smith and Joseph Smith, Sr., the parents of the Prophet Joseph Smith. This grandchild, Mrs. Clara Hendel, a lady eighty-one years old, is a daughter of the Prophet Joseph's youngest sister, Lucy Smith Milliken. On inquiry from Brother Nibley concerning pictures of members of her family, she showed a colored drawing of Lucy Mack Smith to these gentlemen, which she explained she had found among her mother's effects. Elder George Albert Smith assured the members of the family that he would greatly appreciate having a copy of the picture. They replied that they would procure a copy and mail it to him. A colored copy was received by Elder Smith in November, which is the picture he has so graciously presented to the Relief Society. The Relief Society is very appreciative of the gift and is happy to have a picture of this very remarkable mother, Lucy Mack Smith, who joined the Relief Society at its second meeting and gave counsel and support to the Society while it remained in Nauvoo. Note the Book of Mormon which Lucy Mack Smith holds in her hand, and the picture on the wall above her head of the Facsimile from The Book of Abraham, Pearl of Great Price. The picture was perhaps made during the nine years between 1846-1855. Elder Nibley is of the opinion that it was made during the time she resided with her daughter, Lucy Milliken, as it was found in the possession of Mrs. Milliken's daughter, Mrs. Clara Hendel.

MOTHERHOOD is said to be the greatest honor that can be bestowed upon womankind in this world. The act of bringing forth an immortal spirit, clothed with a mortal body, is a woman's crowning achievement. Comparatively few women are denied this accomplishment. But only once in many hundreds of years is the privilege given to a woman to become the mother of a mighty prophet of God, whose life and labors are to change the destiny of a waiting world. Such an honor was bestowed upon Lucy Mack Smith, whose new-found portrait is reproduced as the frontispiece in this issue of TheIt was on July 8, 1776, that a daughter was born to Solomon and Lydia Mack, prosperous farming people of Gilsum, New Hampshire. In the home of these good parents Lucy was reared, with all the refinement and culture known to the inhabitants of western New England at that time. Before she had reached her twentieth birthday, Lucy had met and married a young farmer from Tunbridge, Vermont, named Joseph Smith. Joseph has been described to us as a tall, athletic, young man, an able and willing worker, kind and considerate, "opening his house to all who were needy and destitute." Lucy has told us that at the time of her marriage her husband "owned a handsome farm." She has also related that as a wedding dowry she was presented with a check for $1,000 by her brother Stephen and his business partner. Life began favorably for Joseph and Lucy Smith, yet little did they dream of the strange and extraordinary events which were before them, events which were to lift their names from obscurity into undying fame. Economically Joseph and Lucy Smith were not to prosper in this world. Through misfortune they soon lost their farm, and for a number of years they became tenant farmers in New Hampshire and Vermont. It was while renting a farm from Mrs. Smith's father, Solomon Mack, in Sharon Township, Vermont, that their fourth child and third son was born, named Joseph, Jr. Failing to reestablish themselves in Vermont, Joseph Smith moved his family to western New York in 1815, and located at Palmyra. Here and in the adjacent vicinity they remained for fifteen years. Here the boy Joseph announced his First Vision in the spring of 1820; here he told of the visit of the angel Moroni and the finding of the sacred record, and here the Book of Mormon was printed. Lucy Smith and her husband became the first believers in the visions and revelations which were vouchsafed to their youthful son. And with unsurpassed loyalty and devotion they stood by him in all his efforts to found "the Church and

Kingdom of God." They endured all manner of persecution: the scorn of the world, loss of friends, loss of property, and physical persecution, such as being forced to leave their home in Missouri in the midst of winter and flee across the snow-clad prairies to Illinois. Yet not once did they complain; not once did they lose faith in the divine calling of their son. When the Prophet was taken by the mob in Missouri in October, 1838, he was almost immediately sentenced to be shot. "Several guns were fired, and the heartbroken parents supposed that the bloody work was accomplished." Mother Smith thus describes these moments: "Mr. Smith, folding his arms tight across his heart cried out, 'Oh my God! My God! They have killed my son! They have murdered him, and I must die, for I cannot live without him." Through some strange miracle the lives of Joseph and Hyrum were spared at this time. They were carried to Richmond for trial and from thence to Liberty. "At their departure from Far West, the heart-stricken mother pressed through the crowd to the wagon containing her sons, exclaiming: 'I am the mother of the Prophet: is there not a gentleman here who will assist me to that wagon, that I may take a last look at my children, and speak to them once more before I die?' With her daughter Lucy, she gained the wagon and grasped Joseph's hand, which was thrust between the cover and the wagon-bed, but he spoke not to her until she said: 'Joseph, do speak to your poor mother once more. I cannot bear to go until I hear your voice.' At this he sobbed out: 'God bless you, mother; and while his sister Lucy was pressing a kiss on his hand, the wagon dashed off." (Jenson, Andrew, L. D. S. Biographical Encyclopedia, Vol. 1. P. 691) On September 14, 1840, at Nauvoo, Illinois, in the seventieth year of his life, the good father died, "worn out by the exposures he had suffered in Missouri." Lucy Smith was now left without the companionship of "a tender and loving husband." Yet further misfortunes were to come to her. In the summer of 1841, her youngest son, Don Carlos, died after a brief illness. Three years later, there occurred at Carthage, Illinois, the tragic murder of her sons Joseph and Hyrum. Her poignant grief and sorrow at this time are well expressed in her own words: "I was swallowed up in the depth of my afflictions," she writes, "and though my soul was filled with sorrow past imagination, yet I was dumb, until I arose again to contemplate the spectacle before me. Oh! At that moment how my mind flew through every scene of sorrow and distress which we had passed together, in which they had shown the innocence and sympathy which filled their guileless hearts. As I looked upon their peaceful, smiling countenances, I seemed almost to hear them say, 'Mother, weep not for us, we have overcome the world by love; we carried to them the Gospel, that their souls might be saved; they slew us for our testimony and thus placed us beyond their power; their ascendency is for a moment, ours is an eternal triumph.'" (Smith, Lucy, Joseph Smith the Prophet, p. 278) Joseph the Prophet and Hyrum the Patriarch will never have a more sincere and inspiring tribute than this, given to them by their dear old mother as she stood beside their coffins in the Mansion House at Nauvoo that June day in 1844. As if she had not suffered sufficiently in the loss of her husband and three grown sons in the short space of four years, Mrs. Smith was called upon to part with another son, Samuel Harrison, less than five weeks after the death of Joseph and Hyrum. In fleeing from the mob at Carthage he had overexerted himself. In a few weeks he fell ill and died. Of the six sons Mrs. Smith had reared to maturity, only one now remained, William, who had shown himself to be the least capable of rendering aid and assistance to her. Such was the fate of this good woman. At the last General Conference of the Church held in Nauvoo, in October 1845, after President Brigham Young and the members of the Quorum of the Twelve had decided to lead the Latter-day Saints to a new home in the West, Mrs. Smith asked the privilege of addressing one of the meetings. I find the following in the Journal History: "Mother Lucy Smith, the aged and honored parent of Joseph Smith, having expressed a wish to say a few words to the congregation, she was invited upon the stand. She spoke at considerable length, and in an audible manner, so as to be heard by a large portion of the vast assembly. She commenced by saying that she was truly glad that the Lord had let her see so large a congregation. She had a great deal of advice to give, but Brother Brigham Young had done the errand; he had fixed it completely. There were comparatively few in the assembly who were acquainted with her family. She was the mother of ten children, seven of whom were boys. She raised them in the fear and love of God, and never was there a more obedient family. She warned parents that they were accountable for their children's conduct; advised them to give them books and work to keep them from idleness; warned all to be full of love, goodness and kindness, and never to do in secret, what they would not do in the presence of millions. She wished to know of the congregation whether they considered her a mother in Israel? (upon which President Brigham Young said, 'All who consider mother Smith as a mother in Israel, signify it by saying "yes."' One universal 'yes' rang throughout.) She remarked that it was just eighteen years since Joseph Smith the Prophet had become acquainted with the contents of the plates; and then in a concise manner related over the most prominent points in the early history of her family; their hardships, trials, privations, persecutions, sufferings, etc., some parts of which melted those who heard her to tears...." Regarding the migration of the Saints westward, she continued: "I feel the Lord will let Brother Brigham take the people away. Here in this city lie my dead, my husband and children; and if it so be the rest of my children go with youand I would to God they may all gothey will not go without me; and if I go, I want my bones brought back in case I die away, and deposited with my husband and children." Here President Young interrupted to say:

"Mother Smith proposes a thing which rejoices my heart: she will go with us. I can answer for the authorities of the Church; we want her and her children to go with us; and I pledge myself in behalf of the authorities of the Church, that while we have anything, they shall share with us....I pledge myself, if mother Smith goes with us and I outlive her, I will do my best to bring her bones back again, and deposit them with her children, and I want to know if this people are willing to enter into a covenant to do the same?" (There was a unanimous vote favorable to President Young's request.) It is well known that Mother Smith, in spite of her expressed wish on this occasion, did not make the journey westward with the Saints. Perhaps she was dissuaded therefrom by her son, her three daughters, and the Prophet's wife, Emmaall of whom remained behind. She lived nine years after the Saints evacuated Nauvoo in the spring of 1846, and we know little of her history. Brother Andrew Jenson has written that she spent seven years of this time at the home of her youngest daughter Lucy Smith Milliken, and the remaining two years with the Prophet's wife, Emma, in her comfortable home at Nauvoo, where Lucy Mack Smith died on May 5, 1855.

It is difficult for us to understand what thoughts passed through Mother Smith's mind during the last years of her life. She had been the first to listen to the story of the visions of her son; she had witnessed the organization of the Church and its rise; she had followed the Saints in all of their trials and difficulties and persecutions; as the mother of the Prophet, she was always respected and honored by the Saints. Then with swiftness came the events in Nauvoo: the death of her husband, the death of her four sons, and the removal of the great body of the Saints westward. Her last years were spent with her family. There was no congregation of Saints with which she could mingle; there was no preaching of inspired prophets which she could hear. And yet she held fast to her belief and her testimony. No truer Latter-day Saint ever lived than this good mother of the Prophet Joseph Smith. She was loyal to him in life and in death. In the portrait used as a frontispiece for this issue of the Magazine she is shown holding the Book of Mormon in her hand, and she looks fearlessly and calmly into the future, with the firm assurance that this sacred record and the revelations given to her gifted son are God's revealed truth.
