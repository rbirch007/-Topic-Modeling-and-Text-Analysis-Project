Social Science What "America" Means
Lesson 8 Shrines and Monuments (Tuesday, May 25, 1943)
In this lesson, we have briefly written about a few sacred places and shrines, chosen at random from thousands of others. They all will recall to the reader the tragedy, the joy, and the sorrow, toil, and religious fervor of the great events of our history. It is quite natural for us to reverence hallowed places where heroes have died for some great principle, or fought for some noble cause. Such places have an atmosphere of spiritual life. How many lives are monumented in the hearts of mourning mothers, widowed brides, and sorrowful friends. Instead of the full years of natural service from many of her children, our country counts but their poor memories, "the tender grace of a day that is dead." Religious ideals are expressed in magnificent churches and tabernacles. For example, our Tabernacle in Salt Lake City gives us a great message. The very stones are sacred because the hands of our fathers touched them, and we can proudly say as we look at the old building, so majestic and beautiful:
OUR Flag
Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming, Whose broad stripes and bright stars, Thro' the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watch'd, were so gallantly streaming? And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof thro' the night that our flag was still there.
The flag of the United States was adopted by Act of the Continental Congress June 14, 1777, when it was resolved: That the flag of the United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field representing a new constellation. Located on Arch Street in Philadelphia is the house where Betsy Ross made the first American flag "See, this our fathers did for us." from a design prepared by a committee of Congress in consultation with General George Washington. Originally, the committee suggested the. Six-pointed star, but Mrs. Ross preferred the five-pointed star as more artistic and the committee accepted | it. Betsy Ross continued making flags for the Government for many years. In 1789, when General Washington became President of the United States, there were thirteen states in the Union. Vermont was admitted to the Union in 1791 and Kentucky in 1792, consequently Congress passed a bill in 1794 increasing the number of stars and stripes to fifteen. It was not until 1817 that Congress decided to reduce the stripes to thirteen, and increase the number of stars, one for each incoming LESSON DEPARTMENT 141 state. The plan for arranging them in rows was adopted in 1819 and has been continued to the present. The flag with the thirteen stripes and a star added for every new state was completed July 4, 1912, with the admission of the State of Arizona. Charles Evans Hughes, the former Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court has written a beautiful statement on "What the Flag Means." He says: This flag means more than association and reward. It is the symbol of our national unity, our national endeavor, our national aspiration. It tells you of the struggle for independence, of union preserved, of liberty and union one and inseparable, of the sacrifices of brave men and women to whom the ideals and honor of this nation have been dearer than life. It means America first; it means an undivided allegiance... It means that you cannot be saved by the valor and devotion of your ancestors; that to each generation comes its patriotic duty; and that upon your willingness to sacrifice and endure as those before you have sacrificed and endured rests the national hope. It speaks of equal rights; of the inspiration of free institutions exemplified and vindicated; of liberty under law intelligently conceived and impartially administered. There is not a thread in it but scorns selfindulgence, weakness, and rapacity. It is eloquent of our common destiny. The Statue of Liberty Dear to the hearts of Americans is the Statue of Liberty standing on Bedloe Island in New York City harbor. The creator of this noble work was a French sculptor and artist, Frederic Auguste Bartholdi. In talking to a group of friends one day, Bartholdi said: We want our country and the United States to be friends forever, never to take up arms against each other. To cement our bond of friendship, we need a sign, a monument to say to people everywhere, "The United States and France will always be friends." It was he who thought of the Statue of Liberty and who aroused the people of France to give the Statue to the United States, which was done on July 4, 1884. On the base of the Statue is an inscription written by Emma Lazarus, an American poet and essayist of the last part of the nineteenth century. She was a Jewess, and worked valiantly for the relief of Jewish refugees from Russia. She believed passionately in America as a home for the oppressed, which inspired her to write these lines: Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, With conquering limbs astride from land to land; Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand; A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name Mother of Exiles. From her beacon hand, glows world-wide welcome. Independence Hall, Philadelphia In the old city of Philadelphia is Independence Square, tastefully laid out in flower-beds and lawns, with wide and well-shaded walks. On the north side of the Square, and fronting Chestnut Street, is the most hallowed building of American patriotic memories, Independence Hall. The Declaration of Independence was adopted here, July 4, 1776, and here the Constitution of the United States was drafted in 1787. In the central corridor is the sacred Liberty Bell. In the upper floor of the hall, Washington delivered his Farewell Address in closing his term of office as President. 'The large east room is where the Revolutionary Congress met, and the old furniture  LESSON DEPARTMENT remains as it was in those olden days. In the central corridor is the sacred Liberty Bell which bears these immortal words: Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land, unto all the inhabitants thereof; it shall be a jubilee unto you. (Leviticus 25:10) The bell was cast in America after a model that had been made in England, and was hung in the steeple of the State House in the summer of 1753, and was rung on all historic occasions until after the American Revolution. It was rung when the news of the battle of Lexington reached Philadelphia, and you have heard how the bell was rung by Andrew McNair when the Declaration of Independence was passed by the Second Continental Congress. When we were school children how happily we used to recite the words: That old State House bell is silent, Hushed now its clamorous tongue, But the spirit is awakened Still is livingever young; And when we greet the smiling sunlight On the fourth of each July, We will never forget the bellman, Who, twixt the earth and sky, Rang out loudly "INDEPENDENCE!" Which, please God, shall never die. Plymouth Rock Great in their goodness and wise beyond their generation, the Pilgrim Fathers, the founders of the first permanent white settlement in what is now Massachusetts, seem to have been divinely chosen as the men most fit to lay the foundations of a great commonwealth. By their courage, fortitude, and zeal, they won for themselves a home in the American wilderness, and through their political foresight and religious independence, passed on to their 143 countrymen, forall time, a sacred heritage of liberty in thought and deed, a heritage which has become the basis of American life. The little town of Plymouth nestles close to the seashore, and as you stand on Plymouth Rock, you turn and see the beautiful statue of Massasoit, the Indian of peace, created by our famous Utah-born sculptor, Cytus Dallin. Above on the hill is the National Monument to the Forefathers. You will read the inspired Mayflower Compact, which is fundamental to our Constitution. It was drawn up in the cabin of the Mayflower, a few days before the Pilgrims landed. You will never forget a day at Plymouth, for you will realize more than ever the sufferings of those people who came across the "unknown waters" to establish homes and freedom in America. The City of Washington Washington is a city of monuments and shrines. The Washington Monument rises into the sky five hundred and fifty-five feet. Nearby are the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials, magnificent creations, which recall the words of the Psalmist: Lord who shall dwell in thy Tabernacle, Who shall rest upon thy Holy Hill? The Capitol is the crowning glory of Washington. The great dome surmounted by a colossal figure of Freedom can be seen for many miles. The city of Washington became the seat of our national government in 1800. The Capitol is surrounded by many noble buildings, including the Congressional Library and the Supreme Court Building, with its two front pediments bearing the inscriptions: Equal justice under the law. Justice the guardian of liberty. In the Congressional Library are many thousands of original manuscripts, including the original copies of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States.* Down the beautiful Potomac river is Mount Vernon, a "beloved place.". There you may see the old home and rooms made sacred by the Washington family. A few rods to the south of the house is Washington's tomb, and above the portal are these words: I am the resurrection and the life; he that believeth in me though he were dead, yet shall he live.  As we leave the city of Washington, we think of the, lines of John Ruskin, as found in his "Lamb of Memory": Therefore when we build, let us think that we build forever. Let it not be for present delight, nor for present use alone, let it be such work as our descendants will thank us for, and let us think... That men will say as they look upon the labor, "See! This our fathers did for us." (1) Note: Due to the war, valuable historic documents have been removed. But we must cross the continent to our western land, where there are other shrines and monuments. In Portland, Oregon, is the beautiful monument of Sacajewea, the little Shoshone Indian girl who led Lewis and Clark across the continent by way of the Missouri and Columbia rivers1803-1806. Over rude paths beset-with hunger and tisk, she passed on toward the vision of a better country. To an assembly of men busy with the perishable rewards of the day, she brought the three-fold leaven of enduring societyfaith, gentleness, and home, with the nurture of children. If time permits, this lesson also presents an opportunity to class leaders for a discussion of our own Church shrines and monuments. Questions for Discussion 1. Why do people build monuments and shrines? 2. What are some of the monuments you have seen and admire? (It may be a building or a sacred spot that makes its appeal to you.) 3. Why do you think France presented to the United States the beautiful statue in New York City harbor? 4. Can you name three famous sculptors of Utah who have created beautiful monuments? 5. Who are some of the great American sculptors?
