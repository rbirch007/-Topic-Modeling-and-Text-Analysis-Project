To Marry or Not to Marry in Time of War Dr. Harold T. Christensen Brigham Young University MILLIONS of young men and women are asking themselves this question today. In the midst of the uncertainties and the fears of total war, they are wondering what to do about marriage, and for the most part they are confused. The problem is not an easy one and young people are not the only ones who are confused. The many decisions surrounding marriage are difficult enough in normal times, but these difficulties are multiplied and magnified enormously in times of war. War is a crisis in the family institution; patterns of life are changed so fundamentally that courtship and marriage as usual, is simply out of the question. It is hazardous to advise in times like these, for the chance element is great and no one understands very well what the immediate future holds. But hazardous or not, it is important, so that in planning for the future we can be guided by knowledge and understanding as far as is possible rather than by impetuous feelings of recklessness and desperation. The spirit of this article is that of analysis and suggestion rather than preachment or dogmatic pronouncement. 'There is no one formula that will fit all cases and answer all questions regarding war marriage; the decision to marry or not to marry is after all an individual matter depending upon the personal values and external circumstances Page 94 involved in each case. But the decision should nevertheless be an intelligent one, based upon serious thought and a consideration of the factors involved. Our purpose is not to decide the question of war marriage once and for all, but to present some facts and arguments which may aid each person in making his own decision. The Impact of War The repercussions of modern war are felt throughout the entirety of society; no single phase of our social structure, including the relationships of man to woman, escapes. In understanding the problem of marriage in wartime it might be helpful to review briefly some of the effects of the present war upon the family institution: (1) In the first place, marriage, divorce, and birth rates have been greatly accelerated, although it is reasonably certain that this acceleration will be temporary only. Marriages have increased for a number of reasons, running all the way from a desire to escape the draft to either an increased emotionalism brought on by the war, or to a realization that it may be "now or never." Because of recent military regulations, marriage for draft evasion is not as common as it was earlier. Undoubtedly many marriages do take place today, however, due to war hysteria in one form or another. The atmosphere of war is charged with emotionalism; the glamour of the uniform, plus a love for adventure and a feeling of uncertainty in the future, all tend to increase irrational behavior, such as rushing into marriage without adequate thought or preparation. Furthermore, with millions of our boys in the armed services, some of them never to return, there is often the feeling that unless one can marry now he may never have the opportunity later, and hence the tendency to "grasp at straws" in near desperation. It is well known that many women never married following World War I because there were not enough men left to go around (there were more than four million surplus women in the marriageable ages in Germany, France, and England alone), and it is realized that a similar condition will follow this war. In gambling with the future many young men are making sure of the marriage experience before they die, and many young women are saying that if worst comes to worst they would rather be a widow than a spinster anyway. The birthrate has increased as the natural accompaniment of the expanded marriage rate, plus a conscious motivation in some instances, such as draft evasion, the desire on the part of the husband to leave a progeny in case of death, or on the part of the wife to have something to remember her husband by. The divorce rate has increased very likely because more people have more money to finance the divorce proceedings, and also because changes necessitated by the war effort often create family tensions. With millions of men armed services for in the considerable the period of war. Lengths of time, we can logically expect marriage, divorce, and birth rates to fall rapidly in the very near future and to remain low throughout Likewise, with the return of many of these men after the war, it is reasonable to expect a new increase in all of these rates before they again settle down to a somewhat normal level. This was the experience of World War I, and we can expect it again. (2) A second change brought about by the present war is the loosening of moral standards and the lowering of moral conduct. Unfortunately, the rigors and the brutalities of war tend to dull the finer sensitivities of men and, with some at least, to sever the ties binding them to a strict moral course. The normal sex ratio is disturbed in war, placing both males and females of marriageable ages in abnormal environments. 'The male in service is removed from the stabilizing influence of those he knows best and loves, and at the same time is thrown into situations not the most wholesome. The female at home finds courtship competition more difficult because of the shortage of men, and will often lower her standards in order to more successfully compete. And coupled with all this is the hysteria of war mentioned above. Service men are frequently made to feel that loose conduct is expected of them, and girls that it is patriotic to cater to the man in uniform. Many are blindly and selfishly indulging excessively in worldly pleasures on the sad theory that they must have their fun while they can. "Eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow we may die," they are saying, and as a result TO MARRY OR NOT TO MARRY IN TIME OF WAR 95 morals are given a holiday. It is to avoid temptations such as these that some choose to marry. (3) Another effect of war, and the last that will be discussed here, is the weakening of family bonds and the' consequent growth of family instability. Military life tends to unfit the man for home life after the war; separation of husband and wife for long periods during the war permits misunderstandings and infidelities to creep in, leading toward greater maladjustment later; and when the wife works, she gains a new individualism and financial independence that she may not be willing to yield after the war. The growth of nurseries for the care of children belonging to working mothers, is one noticeable indication of declining family functions in the wartime.
The Pros and Cons of Marriage
No one will argue that all marriages should stop in wartime, and likewise no thinking person will justify all of the marriages that take place under the stimulation of war. Marriage is too important an institution to be sidetracked, even for total war; the future of society demands that it have a position of priority. But marriage in time of war is not only continued, but it is expanded and often perverted as well; hasty unions, ill-planned and artificially lived, are in many cases doomed for failure. The question, then, is not, "Should there be marriage in wartime?" but rather, "Who should marry and when?" And the question is a debatable one. As we have already said, there is no one answer that will fit all cases; each person will need to weigh all factors that are involved in his or her particular case, including personal feelings, but not allowing these alone to sway his judgment; and then with his eyes open he should make his own decision taking his chances with the uncertainties of the day. When such notables as Lewis Browne and David Seabury disagree on the advisability of marriage in wartime, it is evident that the problem is a tough one and that the arguments are not all on one side.* Those who favor war marriages usually do so on the grounds that, even though these carry more risks than do marriages in times of peace, risky marriage is better than no marriage at all. It isn't quite fair, they argue, to expect a young person who has planned his future in terms of family life to forego all of this without a try. Thousands, possibly millions, of young men will never return from the battle front, and, through waiting, an equal number of young women will be left without partners in marriage. Why not enjoy the marriage experience before going away to war, they say, thereby insuring the consummation of love although necessarily gambling on the continuance of the marriage state. In addition to this they point out that marriage tends to stabilize those who enter, giving each something to live for, work for, and die for, if necessary. Contentment and clean living during separation are said to result from the assurance that somewhere there is a husband or wife who cares. Opposed to these arguments are those which make war marriage look

like a very risky business. While happy marriage is certainly better than no marriage at all, it is said, unhappy marriage is not, and the probability of unhappiness in war marriages is great. Heightened romanticism and feelings of desperation brought on by the hysteria of war both tend to make marriage a hasty and impetuous affair. In times past girls have asked all sorts of questions concerning their prospective husbands; questions such as, "What family does he come from?" and "How well educated is he?" but now altogether too many are simply saying, "Where is he?" During war neither boys nor girls are as discriminate in choosing a mate as in other times, and they are usually in a bigger hurry to have the marriage performed. All of this means insufficient acquaintance and inadequate preparation for marriage, which in turn means greater marriage failure. Furthermore, long periods of separation between husband and wife, separations which usually follow a hasty wedding and an all too brief married experience, are not conducive to successful marriage adjustment. Worry, misunderstandings, suspicions, and temptations all enter in to frustrate the separated spouses and to make the durability of their union less likely. If neither death nor desertion prevents a reunion of mates following the war there are other casualties that may prove just as bad. If the husband returns home maimed or diseased in some way, for example, the prospect facing a young wife in becoming the caretaker of an invalid for an indefinite future is not a happy one, particularly if the spouses were practically strangers when they married, had little time to get acquainted and become adjusted immediately following marriage, and have grown farther apart through long separations and contradictory experiences. Then too, the dangers regarding infidelity and the cooling or changing of affections toward each other must not be forgotten. Entering marriage impetuously, without preparation, and without the opportunity of normal home life together, make a rather poor combination of circumstances to insure marital happiness, it is argued. And in support of this contention one need only consider the great increase in the divorce rate following every important war.
Factors in Making the Decision
With these arguments in view, and with a knowledge of his own personality traits, feelings, and desires, each young person will make up his own mind as to whether he will marry or not in wartime. But it is hoped that in each case the problem will be intelligently and prayerfully considered before the decision is made, so that the possible consequences of the alternative procedures will be thoughtfully realized and courageously faced. In the spirit of self-analysis the following questions should be asked: (1) Are you well prepared for marriage with each other? If the desire to marry is prompted largely by the war emergency so that you won't "miss out on anything" it is likely that your motives are more those of desperation than of love and companionship. Studies show that marriage is more likely to be successful where the couple has been acquainted for a number of years and has been engaged for a long enough time to adjust and to prepare for what is to come. Unless you have been fairly well acquainted over a considerable length of time, be just a little wary of your motives and also those of your sweetheart. It may be that you are mistaking reckless emotionalism, or military glamour, or mere desperation, for the "real thing." Haste makes for waste even in the marriage game; and it is far better to think first so that "repentence at leisure" will not be necessary. But if you are ready for marriage, and if this readiness has been tested by both time and thought, you may consider it best to accept the hazards of war without letting them change your marital plans. (2) How long will you be able to live together after marriage before the war separates you? The start of any marriage is the most crucial from the standpoint of mutual adjustment in laying foundations for harmonious living, and unless husband and wife can be together for a reasonable period after marriage and under somewhat favorable circumstances they are starting under a handicap. But because of military policy you may not know exactly how long you can be together. In such circumstances the best you can do it to take a chance and do what seems best after other factors are considered. But certainly where you know that you can be together for only a few days, or even a few weeks, you will realize the handicap. Sometimes the wife is permitted to live close to the military camp where her husband is in service, and in this way be with him occasionally. This is often the best solution possible, but even at best it is frequently none too good. High rents, crowded living conditions, frequent movings, and infrequent visits together put them both under strain and make home life difficult if not impossible. (3) Will you be able to finance the marriage? Poverty and economic insecurity are drains on anyone's happiness, even in marriage. This is an important question at any time; but since economic uncertainties are greater in wartime, it becomes all the more important then. With the husband in military service will the wife have adequate financial support? In the event of a child will there be enough to care for them both? (4) Are you willing to accept the inconveniences and the risks involved? If wives are true to their husbands during separation in wartime they will find themselves either staying home or going out without partners, and husbands will similarly find their social life limited. Can you "take it"? Can you be separated and yet maintain the morality and the fidelity required in holy wedlock? Are you strong enough and brave enough to accept the casualties of war should they come to you or yours, and to readjust to whatever the war may leave you? Unless you are mature emotionally, and are brave, the hazards of marriage in wartime may be too great for you. These are serious questions, but they are important for those who are thinking of marriage in this day. Many thousands of the war marriages taking place now are doomed for failure because of the haste and impetuous emotionalism that is bringing them about. But on the other hand, a great many of today's marriages will be happy ones because they were preceded by the thoughtful and prayerful preparation that is ever important, whether in time of war or of peace. By multiplying the uncertainties of the future, war does make marriage more of a risk but it certainly does not preclude the possibility of success. Nonmarriage is better than marriage failure, and if the hazards of war make failure seem imminent in any particular case then that marriage should not be performed. But marriage need not fail, not even in wartime, if preparation has been complete enough and the persons involved are big enough to do their part. That is the answer. Latter-day Saints will let the doctrine of eternal marriage help them solve this all important question. Marriage in wartime should be considered with all the seriousness of purpose as in peacetime, and preparation may be considered as incomplete if the couple is not ready for a temple ceremony. Not even total war justifies a marriage of convenience.
