HUMAN EQUATION Bertha A. Kleinman The schools of the ages have lavished their culture, To fashion my temperament under control, Yet ever, anon, like the claw of a vulture, Some renegade impulse enrages my soul. I rise to the thrill of the great and the glorious, The skies for my highway, I "hitch to a star." By nightfall my envy and greed are victorious, And pitifully human my dream bubbles are. I love and am loved with a depth of devotion, I sing and am glad at the glory of life; And here I am shaken with spiteful emotion, And spoiled is my day with its tempest and strife. I rise at the spur of demand and occasion, I plunge at defeat, at temptation, I fall; My triumph, my failure are human equation My task to exalt the composite of all!
