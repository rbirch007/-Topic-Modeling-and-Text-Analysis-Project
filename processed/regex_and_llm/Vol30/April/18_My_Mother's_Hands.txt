MY MOTHER'S HANDS Ethel VanHook Hopper You call your hands "an awful sight," "So hard and brown; they're never white." But mother, dear, you are not nght. For to my eyes your hands are fair And beautiful beyorid compare, They show your love, your tender care. Oh, may my hands give back to you  Some service that I know is due To show my gratitude is true! MAKING OVER Della Adams Leitner I've been busy making over For my little son today An old suit, and in the making Joy has come to bless my way. Turned and cut and stitched I view it, Glad that I could make it so, And these thoughts it brings to cheer me, As creative power I know. God is always making over All that's worn and cast away, All that's seeming base and useless, All that men pronounce decay. Making over by His sunshine, Making over by His rain, Making over in the darkness Where His eye can see so plain, Making over into brightness, Making over into grace, Into loveliness and beauty That transform the meanest place. Soul of mine, thy sins so many, Thy mistakes so full of pain, God can take them, He can use them, Make them over into gain. By Thy sorrow, by Thy counsel, Thou canst humbly point the way, Show the tender youth the pitfalls, Point them to the better way. Trust to God the unknown future, Leave to Him the darkened past. By His power of making over You shall rise, transformed at last. Page 275 - Page 276
