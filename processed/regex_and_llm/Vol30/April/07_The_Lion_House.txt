The Lion House Rachel G. Taylor FAMILY tradition says that Brigham Young's remembrance of the many-gabled windows of a white house in Vermont was the inspiration for the Lion House. His brother-in-law, Truman O. Angell, was the architect, but Brigham Young's training as a cabinetmaker and builder were definitely shown in many details of his new home. The exact date of the completion of the Lion House was not recorded. The pioneers were so busy doing things, that slight attention was given to writing about them. From Truman O. Angell's journal it would appear that the work was commenced in 1854. (Apparently the Bee Hive House was being finished at this time.) He writes: July 10, 1854I have been very busy with the various duties obligatory on me as an architect what time my health permits. My present work is on the details of President Young's large new house but I have to be posted upon many other jobs such as the sugar factory, President Young's old house that was carried up last fall, etc. August 10th, 1854Since my last sketching I have been busy on various plans, one for the President's big house... August 27th, 1854I have just made out details for finishing the president's big house. April 2, 1855Since March 16th finished East elevation of Temple, designed front elevation of President Young's big house, which was drawn by William W. Ward. May 8, 1855I am now preparing to go south with the President on his annual trip to the settlements. While I am gone Brother William W. Ward will keep a journal and insert it here of the proceedings with the business of the office. I have EARLY VIEW OF LION HOUSE charged him with the finishing of the flagging of the President's porch, also setting the steps and also making the handrail. December 29th, 1855-I made out several parts of finish to be erected in the President's big house that will show for itself in a few days. HE style followed the pattern of early English mansions. The first of the three stories was built of large sandstone blocks. The other two of sun-baked Mormon adobe. The roof was shingled and had six towering double chimneys to take care of the stoves and many open fireplaces throughout the interior of the building. ) Page 249 250 The home received its name from the lion on its vestibule roof. Of this lion there is the following item in the Millennial Star of January 26, 1856: A stone lion of the size of life, most beautifully and correctly sculptured by Brother William Ward, has been elevated to its position on the battlement porch at the south end of President Young's large family dwelling. The walls, inside as well as out, were made twenty-three inches thick. The joists for the basement floors were straight pine poles about six inches in diameter. 'Twenty dormer windows, ten on each side, were among its most distinctive features. The face of the adobe walls was plastered smoothly and given a coat of light whitewash, adding dignity to the building. There were small panes of glass in all the windows. An observant visitor may still distinguish pioneer made "wavy panes," which have survived the years. When the original green shutters, so distinctive of colonial houses, wore out, they were discarded, but recently they have been restored. The crumbling plaster on adobe walls was later replaced with a veneer of cement blocks, adding to the stability, but materially detracting from the beauty of the house. The plan on the inside had a aime acter all its own. On each floor there was a long hall running the entire length of the building. The main and upper halls each had two glasspaned partitions with a door in the center. This conserved heat and also was pleasing to the eye. Before the days of gas and electricity, two rows of brackets with oil lamps ran down the hall and lighted its shadowy length. THERE were forty rooms in the home. On the upper floor leading from the hall were twenty rooms, four with two windows, the other sixteen each with a side dormer window. Many of the rooms had fireplaces. Later some of the rooms had Franklin stoves. Bedrooms without stoves were heated with a stovepipe crossing its width near the ceiling. On the main floor the parlor and nine private living rooms branched from the hall. The lower floor hall had doors leading to the family dining room, the pantry, kitchen, laundry, school room, bathroom, milk room, weaving room, and two large stone-tiled rooms, used for cellar and vegetable storage. A hall to the east led out into the court, where first the well, and later the pump, furnished the water for family use. Through many passing years, widely varied activities have been carried on in this outstanding edifice. First it served the purpose for which it was erected, it was a beloved home for Brigham Young and many of his wives and children. An item in the Journal History, Dec. 24, 1856, tells of a party in December of the year the Lion House was completed President Brigham Young gave an entertainment in his new residence the "Lion House" on Christmas evening to the large number of the missionaries returned from foreign missions and a few other brethren with their wives. THE LION HOUSE 251 VIEW OF PARLOR OF LION HOUSE Showing original cupboards and table made for Brigham Young Soon after the company assembled the President expressed gratitude at being able to comfortably entertain so goodly a party, most cordially greeted all with a fatherly welcome and invited them to enjoy themselves with singing and conversation, or with praying and preaching as might seem to them good and remarked as he often does, in inviting guests to a party, the only limitation to number, in his feelings, was the extent of room for their accommodation, hence had he a suitable room, he would never wish to stop until he had invited every Latter-day Saint in all the world. Later some of the east rooms on the main floor were used for Church office purposes. In 1900 the building was purchased by the Church and became a part of the L. D. S. University. In 1931, when all departments of the school, except the Business College, were discontinued, the Presidency of the Y. W. M. I. A. Made a request that they be allowed to use it as a social center for girls and women. And in Dec. 1931, the request was granted. The last ten years have seen this outstanding product of pioneer building once more invested with the spirit and charm of a hospitable community home. The late Harrison R. Merrill sensed the new mission of the home when he wrote: As the visitor walks up the few steps and pushes open the beautiful handmade door and stands in the dimly lighted hall, if he is one who is prone to honor and reverence the past as being prophetic of the future, he cannot help feel that he is in a building which was once home to a very great man. In fact he is likely to call it the Mt. Vernon of the West, for here the father of the Wilderness, also a home lover, a believer in the soil and in the common man, lived and died. 252 As he tiptoes into the famous parlor which has served as reception room for many of the greatest men of the world, and stands there in the presence of the spirit of Brigham Young, the colonizer, the statesman, the empire builder, he can be excused for dreaming fine dreams of what the Lion House Social Center is to mean to thousands and thousands of girls and women. He can there feel the very spirit of the place which breathes warmly though softly the words, "Welcome, come in and make yourself at home." This old parlor with its deep-set windows and expertly finished wall cabinets is a homey room. It is the place where the family gathered for prayers, where social gatherings were held, and where young men, courted their sweethearts.: The skillfully grained cherrypainted woodwork, with its gold band trim, is the same as when the house was finished in 1856. Around the room are comfortable wooden chairs, exact copies of the ones made. For this spot by the "Public Work ShopsGreat Salt Lake City." A Harwood painting of the family farm, now Liberty Park, a duplicate of one of Brigham Young's couches, and his beautifully carved mahogany center table lends the atmosphere of his day to this interesting parlor. The Journal History, Jan. 6, 1859 relates:. He (President Young) then took the brethren into the Lion House parlor, 32 feet long and 16 feet wide, showed them two center tables made of solid mahogany, made in this city. When Thomas S. Williams was cutting his great wall, he brought from the states a log of mahogany about 14 inches through. Williams and Hooper insisted that Governor Young should take it; the tables were made by William Bell and they are superb specimens of workmanship. He also showed them a looking glass which he said Wil-  liams and Hooper had sold him with its mate. They bought them for their own use, and when they smashed up they prevailed on the President to buy them, their cost in the states were $100 each. The President gave a wild breeding mare for them. He also showed them a piano and said eight of his girls under eleven years of age had learned to play on it. He said he had another in the Bee Hive Mansion. The Pesident remarked that last year when the army was coming up the Platte the officers fully expected to make their headquarters in the Lion House and that now he had forty children in it under 13 years of age and altogether seventy-five persons. Nearly a dozen little cherubs were in the parlor studying their lessons when the brethren entered. The room through the doorway to the north also has the original painted woodwork representing oak, with the graining so typical of the best buildings of that period. Here is found an old-fashioned fireplace, one of the many that was originally built in the house. In the Pioneer room at the far end of the hall, one feels the atmosphere of bygone days. Two layers of modern hardwood flooring that covered the original floor have been removed, and varied widths of pine flooring, their color mellowed by age, form an appropriate background for the circular ivory and rose braided tugs. 'The blue tinted walls and matching paint on woodwork, the wax fruit under a towering crystal dome, duplicates of Brigham Young's couches and chairs, and his gold muffler, with gay rose and blue tulips framed on the wall, make this room a joy to lovers of pioneer handicraft. There are two memorial rooms on the main floor. It is appropriate that these rooms should contain many interesting relics belonging to THE LION HOUSE Brigham Young and his immediate family. It was in the larger of these two rooms that President Young died. His daughter Zina wrote of his passing, "the canopy bed he occupied... Was placed before the window where he could get the air and his loved ones be around him." History tells us that a throng of anxious saints waited night as well as day in the court outside his bedroom window. When they heard the words "He is gone," slowly and reverently, with grief-stricken hearts, they ended their long vigil. In this room are his clothes, his cape and shawl, dishes from the Governor's dinner set, a_ table, couch, and chairs originally used in the house. Here is an exquisite chenille shawl, and also dresses, shoes, and fans belonging to his wives and daughters. Of children's toys there is a set of three little rocking chairs, and a charming wax doll. On the top floor there still remains a room the size of the twenty original ones, two of the old fireplaces, and the inside detail of the many-gabled windows. A south door leads out onto the battlement porch where the famed stone lion has. Rested for nearly a century. A visit to the house is not complete unless one goes to the lower floor where kitchens, laundry, weaving, provision, and the large dining room were located. All this space is now occupied by the Center cafeteria, with its six dining rooms. The most interesting of these are the ones converted from the old provision cellars. Taking up a worn-out, musty wooden floor disclosed the original flagstones. The walls show the size 253 ONE OF THE TWENTY DORMER WINDOWS and type of stone and adobe used in the construction of the building. Copies of pioneer tables and rush bottom chairs complete this unusual setting. The building adjoining the Lion House on the east housed the offices of the presidents of the Church and served as territorial headquarters when Brigham Young was governer. This building is now a part of the Social Center. These rooms are among the most interesting to the thousands of tourists who are conducted through the center each year by volunteer guides.

VIEW OF TWO MEMORIAL ROOMS Showing one corner of the room in which Brigham Young died, and on into farther room where dresses worn by members of his family are on display. Of office documents tucked in tiny pigeonholes, its golden-toned desks with scroll saw decorations makes a most interesting spot. * * * Time has been kind to the Lion House. Its quaint touches of another century's beauty blend harmoniously with the happy activities it houses. Brigham Young was a man of vision, building for the future. It is fitting that the Retrenchment Association, organized by him in the Lion House parlor, should grow into the Young Woman's Mutual Improvement Association with a membership of over 82,000, whose executives seek to carry the spirit of his hospitality and high standards to all who enter the doors of his home, the Lion House. Study order and cleanliness in your various occupations. Adorn your city and neighborhood. Make your homes lovely, and adorn your hearts with the grace of God. 8:297.Discourses of Brigham Young, page 310.
