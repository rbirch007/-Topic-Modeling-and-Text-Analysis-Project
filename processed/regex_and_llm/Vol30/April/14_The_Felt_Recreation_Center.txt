The Felt Recreation Center Marie Fox Felt Streets on East First South Street in Salt Lake City, Utah, especially when days are pleasant, one may see little children playing on the sidewalk or perhaps sitting on the steps of the entrance to a cheap hotel which is their home. There are other such places in downtown Salt Lake and many other such children, but to the hurrying crowds on the busy streets, that means little or nothing. But there is a story here, a challenging story, and these children need our interest, our attention and our love. For a moment let us go behind the front door of this hotel and meet some of the children and their parents. Such a chance came to the writer one day in the following way: The large door of the J. H. Felt Motor Supply Company at 60 Regent Street in Salt Lake City was pushed open wide. The truck rolled out on its way to serve the garage men and service station operators with auto supplies and accessories. The door remained open. It was the spring of 1938. As I stood at the door, enjoying the first breath of spring air, two little boys walked up this narrow street. As they neared the door, David spoke. "Hello." "Hello" I said, returning the greeting. "And where do you boys live?" They told me, and as the conversation continued I learned from these boys that they belonged to a gang Page 262 B seexts on State and Main to which only children up to ten might belong. And they had a hut. There men tacked wall paper up to make rooms, they hid their money in tin cans, and the girls cooked their dinner. "Just where is this hut?" I asked. "Oh, we can't tell. Only kids in our gang can know," they said. The next day they were back again. "T'm just as sorry as I can be that I am not ten years old," I said. "Why?" they asked. "Because if I were, perhaps you would let me belong to your gang." "Oh, you can," said David. "Each year we make it higher. Next year kids up to twelve can belong." "How many years before I may belong?" I asked. "Oh, we will let you belong right now," they said. Next day they agreed to let my husband and also our stockman join, and the gang headquarters were immediately transferred to the loading platform of the J. H. Felt Motor Supply Company. Each day, all summer long, whenever the trucks were not loading, the children played. In ages they ranged from two to twelve, in numbers from ten to fifteen at a time. Pencils, crayons, the backs of discarded letter papers, newspapers, crepe paper, sewing sets, games and packing boxes, together with healthy, active imaginations were combined to make pleasant and happy hours for these children. THE FELT RECREATION CENTER 263 ORIGINAL GROUP OF CHILDREN WHO PLAYED AT J. H. FELT MOTOR SUPPLY COMPANY, 1938 Mrs. Marie Fox Felt standing at back Puppet shows, vaudeville shows, reproductions of movies, including their version of "Romeo and Juliet" were presented. Under guidance they were safe and the ugly side of life, too often the lot of such children to know, was partially replaced by happier things. AS time went on, many people became interested in this little group. Each day for many months Miss Merle Corey brought two gallons of milk to our store for these children. It was dispensed to them in quart bottles, divided according to the number in a family. Milk, vegetables, and apples were also supplied to this group by Mr. Joseph Kirkwood and Miss Mary Kirkwood of American Fork, and brought to Salt Lake by Miss Corey. Games, clothing, etc., were furnished from time to time by Mr. And Mrs. C. Lamont Felt, Miss Rose Jones, Mrs. George H. Wallace and others. When traveling salesmen would call to sell merchandise to my husband, Joseph H. Felt, they also would make contributions to the happiness of this little group. Chief among these were Mr. Paul J. Buss of the Burrell Belting Company of Chicago. Upon one visit to Salt Lake he and his good wife bought quite a number of games and presented them to us for the children. One Saturday afternoon early in the summer the group was taken to Hogle Zoo for an outing. None of these children had ever been to the Zoo before. Each child was 264 supplied with a bag of popcorn to feed the animals. Such a wonderful afternoon it was! After a ride to Fort Douglas and the State Capitol, the outing was concluded by a trip to an ice cream parlor as guests of Mr. C. Lamont Felt. Throughout the hot summer days these children played in the space where the trucks were parked when not in use. The numbers grew constantly. Each new little child who moved into this hotel was immediately brought to meet me and be introduced to the playthings available. A workbench provided the table upon which to draw, and wooden packing boxes were the chairs upon which the children sat. In order to avoid controversy each child had a box of his own upon which his name was printed. That was his chair whenever he wished to claim it. We all enjoyed that summer. I thought that when school started our summer play school would end, but not so. The children came to see me on their way to school; they called in at noon as they went home for lunch; and again as they went back to school after lunch. From about 3:45 until 5:30 our store was filled with children: drawing, putting on shows and programs, playing with plasticine and printing presses, etc. We had more children than at any previous time. "ONE day someone announced that "' Bob had moved into the hotel and that he was so mean that everybody hated him. He was sort of a bully, teasing at every turn. "If you let him come over here to play, we can't come any more," the children confided to me., 1943 "Why not invite Bob to come to our club?" I asked. "If we keep him busy doing good things and having a good time, he won't have time to be mean to you and tease you." The children just gasped. They knew if they did they wouldn't be able to come themselves. I then said, "Well, talk it over with your parents. Ask them if they don't think it best to have Bob come: here where we can keep him busy doing good things rather than to keep him outside ready to de mean things to you when you come out." Days passed by. One evening just' as I was about to go home from work, Don and Johnny came dashing in, calling, "Mrs. Felt, Mrs. Felt, guess what?" Of course I wondered what on earth had happened. They said that they had been talking to Bob about clubs and gangs and had told Bob that they belonged to one. "Which one do you belong to" Bob had asked. "To Mrs. Felt's gang," replied Don. "Why don't you let me belong?" "Because" answered Don, "If you belong to Mrs. Felt's gang you will have to be good." Well, Bob promised to be good, and the next day he came to play with the other children. He was just as pleasant and grand as a little boy could be, and proved to be quite a leader. One day I asked him if he liked to belong to our club and he >>? Replied, "Darn tootin'. Y this time the group of children had grown to such numbers that I decided I must either assume a fulltime THE FELT RECREATION CENTER 265 CHILDREN AT SAND TABLE Felt Recreation Center, 1940 job with them and resign as the bookkeeper of the J. H. Felt Motor Supply Company, or make arrangements with some one to care for them. Their homes or hotel rooms were so small, so poorly furnished, and so unattractive, that I felt I could not send them back there. There must be a way out, I decided. One day representatives of the W. P. A. Nursery School and Parent Education movement called at the store to see me. I spoke to them about this opportunity for the W. P. A. To perform a marvelous bit of service. Right in the heart of town, according to statistics, was the hot spot for juvenile crime and delinquency.. Too much leisure time in a poor environment with poor surroundings encouraged children to engage in the first acts which lead to trouble. My callers were greatly impressed with the urgent need for action. They talked with the leaders in charge of the W. P. A. Recreation program. One of their number was sent to investigate the matter. After a thorough investigation he considered the project one of great merit. He conferred with Miss Jessie Schofield, at that time superintendent of Salt Lake City's recreation program, with whom the W. P. A. Co-operated on all projects within the confines of Salt Lake City. She likewise made an investigation and voiced her hearty approval. The next problem was to find a place in which to meet. Funds were low and no one seemed to be able to obtain sufficient money with 266 which to rent a building. After some time, permission was granted by Mayor John M. Wallace and Wallace F. Bennett, representing their corporation, to use the rear of the building upstairs at 68 Regent Street, rent free, if the city would pay for the light and heat. In addition to this, these men provided $100.00 for the buying of necessities to fix up the building. With this money and some provided by the Salt Lake City Recreation Department, W. P. A. Labor cleaned, catcimined, and painted the interior of the building. ON March 9, 1939 the Center was opened and officially christened the Felt Recreation Center.. A few days previous to this time, when the invitations were being sent out to the parents and children, Bob asked if he might take one to Judge Rulon Clark of the Juvenile Court, Mr. Clegg, and others. (Bob was a ward ot the Juvenile Court.) As a result of these invitations the Judge and four of the men who worked in that department came. On the opening night at 7:30 crowds filled the hall. Miss Jessie Schofield was master of ceremonies. A very interesting and varied program was presented. Here were about 200 who attended on that opening night. Representatives from the City, the Kiwanis Club, the W. P. A., the Women's Clubs, Church groups and Mr. Wallace Bennett as landlord of the building, were present. Refreshments were served through the courtesy of the Kiwanis Club. During the next year the crowds increased. The age of the children attending went gradually upward. The activities became many and varied to interest those of all ages. There was also a play school for the little children under school age. After school, activities were provided for children from six to eighteen. A handcraft department was added for the benefit and interest of the mothers. ONE year later, March 1940, it became necessary for the Center to move a second time. There were far too many children attending regularly to accommodate them adequately. Through the courtesy of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints we moved into the building at 60 South 2nd East. This was provided to use rent free, with the City paying the light, heat, and janitorial service. Gymnasium facilities were provided in addition to all of the activities that had been a regular part of the program previously. A dance was held for the teen-age boys and gitls each Friday evening. Often as many as two hundred and fifty young people between the ages of fourteen and eighteen attended. There was no admission charge. Good behavior was the only requirement. While at this location our enrollment reached the seven hundredth mark. In May 1941, it was necessary for us to move again. The Government needed more room for regional offices and wanted our quarters in addition to those they were occupying next door to us. We all felt that we must now find permanent quarters. The project had grown to the point where we felt that it was worthy of consideration by the City. THE FELT RECREATION CENTER Consequently the efforts of the City Recreation Department, the Kiwanis Club, and the Felt Advisory Council were pooled to accomplish this. After much work on the part of this group, the City Commission voted to purchase the old Masonic Temple located on the corner of First South and Second East in Salt Lake City. With it came property 165 feet by 165 feet, thus providing space for an outdoor playground, a luxury which had not been ours up to this time. We were just beginning to get settled in this new home of ours when World War II broke out. Our boys in the service had to be taken care of, and quarters for the U. S. O. Became a vital necessity. Because our building was so large and so wellfitted for the program needed for our soldier boys, we were asked once more to step aside and to find other quarters for the duration of the war. This we did after being assured by the City Commission that this building and property would be returned to the City Recreation Department for the use and benefit of these downtown children after the war was over. An order to this effect appears on the City's books in the Recorder's Office. T present, the Felt Recreation Center is located at 151 South State Street in Salt Lake City. This place has been leased for the Center by the City Commission for its use during the war, until such a time as it may return to the building originally purchased for it. Due to the size of the building, the program is a curtailed one. Only children of 267 school age can be accommodated. In these war times we are glad to have such a beautiful and comfortable place, even though it is too small for our needs. Another thing for which we are very glad is the quality of leadership provided here for the boys and girls by the Salt Lake City Corporation. Under their leadership, the boys and girls enrolled at the Center have set up self-governing organizations. They have their own officers and councils. 'They set up their own standards of behavior and plan their own activities. Each month they pay dues of 5c each. For those who may not have the money, provision is made whereby they may perform a service in lieu of it. Limited gymnasium facilities are provided, also table tennis, quiet games, handcraft, woodwork, books and magazines for reading, art instruction, sewing, vocal and instrumental music opportunities, dancing, golf instruction, archery, clay modeling, and assistance with the hobbies of those who attend. All in all it is a busy and an interesting place. Those who come are made most welcome. As to whether or not the Center has accomplished the good for which it was organized, we can only say that according to Judge Rulon Clark of the Juvenile Court, this Center has done more to assist his department in the overcoming and prevention of crime than any other single endeavor that has come to his notice. Our goal is far from reached, but we be. Lieve that with the generous interest and support of all those who are working for the welfare of youth, there will come a time when juvenile delinquency will be a rarity.
