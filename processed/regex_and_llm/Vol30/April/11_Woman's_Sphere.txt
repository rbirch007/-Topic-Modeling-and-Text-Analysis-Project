Woman's Sphere Ramona W. Cannon A VERY commendable movement has been started in Ferron, Emery Co., Utah, which might well spread to other parts of the country. So many of the inhabitants of Ferron have moved away to engage in war industries that sixty homes and orchards have been left vacant. Mrs. Amy Greenhalgh, a public-spirited citizen of that town, organized a club, "The Vacant Home Vanguard," among the boys. The city was divided into four sections, and each section placed under the charge of a group of boys to look after the vacant property and try to care for and protect the fruit trees. Mrs. Greenhalgh herself has now moved away, but is striving to interest other people in this very worthwhile movement, and is especially anxious for the mothers of the boys to encourage them in this fine undertaking. Don Hansen, 14, is the leader of the boys. Louise Anderson, a WAAC, attended the famed Casablanca conference. Princess Elizabeth of England, heir apparent to the throne, will be seventeen years old April 21. The third daughter of Princess Juliana, heir apparent to the Dutch throne, is the first royal child to be born in North America. Canada welcomed the little princess. So There, the book of charming children's poems by' Mrs. Vilate Raile of Salt Lake City, is winning much acclaim. Children themselves suggested many of the subjectsa spider, duck, a bee folded in a hollyhock. The illustrations by Mildred Dickeman are also delightful. LORD CHESTERFIELD, famous for conventional politeness, wrote to his son in 1748: Women are to be regarded only as children of a larger growth; they have an entertaining tattle and sometimes wit; but for solid reasoning good sense, I never in my life knew one that possessed it. A man of sense humors and flatters them, but he neither consults about, nor trusts them with serious matters.... They love to be dabbling in business, which, by the way, they always spoil. That was in the day when all powerful man patterned woman's design for living. We hope that Chesterfield's shade looked down upon Madame Chiang Kai-shek addressing Congress in Washington, and was duly apologetic. Flower of modern womanhood that has developed in a more liberal age, Madame Chiang displayed a logical and exquisitely cultivated mind, a statesmanlike attitude, and moving eloquence. After Japan's inhuman cruelty to China for five and onehalf years it was magnificently Christian of Madame Chiang to plead that future peace be without punishment for the conquered peoples.
