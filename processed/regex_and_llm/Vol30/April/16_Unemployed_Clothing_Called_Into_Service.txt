Unemployed Clothing Called Into Service Leda T. Jensen Member of Relief Society General Board REMODELING means to again or to rearrange. To the woman trained to "waste not want not," who is skillful with her fingers and the tools of sewing, the word remodeling is a fascinating one, setting up in her mind all sorts of ideas for the creating of useful and lovely articles of wearing apparel from used material which would otherwise be often wasted. To all too many women the word has little or no meaning, and only calls to mind an undesirable problem in which she has and wants no part. The whole world is at war. No one can say when peace will be established again, nor what the conditions will be when the clouds of war have cleared away. We are, however, becoming increasingly mindful of the fact that the problems of the present conflict are touching our lives more and more, disrupting our living routine, and our method of doing things. We hear on all sides the words conservation, salvaging, saving. 'The home is called the second front, and women in the home are urged to accept the challenge to do their part in various ways to help win the war. Because commodities of all kinds are flowing into army camps and Page 20 being sent to battlefronts and the United Nations in all part of he world, consumers are finding their purchasing of goods of all kinds greatly limited. Clothing the family is a problem vital to the war effort. Textiles are weapons of war. The requirements of our armed forces for textiles and clothing affects every family in the United States. Even before Pearl Harbor, national production managers and economists of our country foresaw what might happen to the things we buy, and the Government began a National War on Waste. The highlight of Civilian Defense Week November 11th to 16th, 1941, was the signing of the Consumer's Pledge by millions of Americans. Mrs. Roosevelt and the White House housekeeper signed the first pledge which read: As a consumer in the total defense of democracy, I will do my part to make my home, my community, my country, ready, efficient, and strong. I will buy carefully. I will take good care of the things I have. I will waste nothing. The Consumer's Pledge as it relates to clothing means to waste nothing, to take care of every bit of fabric in the home, and to buy carefully. UNEMPLOYED CLOTHING CALLED INTO SERVICE OMEN all over the country have accepted this challenge as a patriotic duty. There is more money in circulation today, but the patriotic citizen spends his money first for taxes, debts, and bonds, and almost last for extra clothing in order to release more textiles and clothing: for direct war needs. "To release materials, machines, men, and money for war operations, civilians must cut their clothing requirements to the core, basing them on needs, not wants. It is important to civilian morale that this situation be met intelligently and cheerfully." If we do not meet the problem voluntarily, rationing will force us to do so. "This year of 1943 should be a year of conservationstain removal, moth control, mending, alteration of patterns, fitting, remodeling old clothes, and making new ones." War, with its extra calls for sewing and mending, always gives impetus to needlework. Sewing for the Red Cross to help care for the wounded on the battlefield and in the hospitals, as well as to clothe refugees in Europe and China, started a revival of home sewing throughout the country even before the United States declared war on the Axis. Since Pearl Harbor the need has come closer home, and women are meeting the challenge to conserve for the war effort. The sale of yardage goods throughout the nation has increased from 40 to 50 per cent over the sales during the same period in former years, and the sale of patterns has almost kept pace. There is a growing desire on the part of many women to acquire the ability to wield a needle. Higher 271 living costs are making many women who have been accustomed to buy their clothing ready-made, turn to home sewing as a means of getting the quality they want for the price they can pay. The rationing of tires and gasoline, the extreme difficulty in procuring maid service for the home, and the ever-growing list of rationed foods and household articles will result in many women, particularly women with dependent young children, remaining in their homes more than they did before the war. Art and needlework instructors in department stores report that more women are interested in handwork at the present time than for many years. 'This is probably due to one or both of two reasons: (1) the desire to assist the war effort by knitting and sewing for the Red Cross; and (2) the desire to find an outlet for emotional and mental strain. Since women are turning to the satisfactions derived from working with their hands, it is well for those women with children or small friends and relatives, to turn part of their desire for handwork into utilizing outmoded wearing apparel for their clothing needs. T is sometimes difficult to find time for sewing, mending, and renovating, but time should be taken for all of these. Attics and storage places should be searched for all '"'unemployed" garments that may be put into service. It is wise to bring outmoded garments into use to conserve clothing, to save money, and to utilize. Materials which are better than those to be purchased now. 272 The present regulations for price control are not tied to specific standards of quality. A ceiling price as of a certain date carries with it no sure  guarantee that the quality is the same as that of a former date. Reduction of serviceability without a consequent reduction in price is contrary to the spirit of the regulation, but enforcement of such a principle in the complex field of clothing is exceedingly difficult. Numerous complaints are coming from consumers to the effect that though they pay higher prices for wearing apparel, they have no assurance as to its wearing qualities, laundering, or cleaning possibilities. Because of this, it may be wise for a consumer to use material she has on hand that has proved to be good and wait for something more to be done in the way of labeling to reveal the fiber content, method, and kind of dye used, cleaning possibilities, etc., of any new materials she buys. "Ready-made articles of clothing will rise more in price than yard goods. Increasing clothing costs can be met by home sewing, particularly in the field of remodeling." When one sets out to remodel an article, the material or fabric is already at hand. Often the only outlay of money will be for a spool of thread and a pattern. Some findings for remodeled garments need cost no money. It takes only a little while to make a collection of buckles, buttons, zippers, snap fasteners, and hooks and eyes from worn-out garments. If these are sorted and kept in separate cans or boxes, they will be readily accessible when needed for use on remodeled garments or even on new ones. Most remodeling has to do with the making of children's clothing from adults. The reason for this is obvious. Often it isn't possible to change the style of a garment for an adult by
