Birthday Congratulations THE members of the Relief Society extend their love and congratulations to Sister Lula Greene Richards who will celebrate her ninety-fourth birthday on April eighth. Sister Richards is unusually well and active for her years, and her remarkable memory recalls important events in the life of Utah for many decades. She was called to assume the editorship of the Woman's Exponent when in her early twenties, and she faithfully performed this work until home ties prevented the continuance of her editorial duties in 1877, after serving for five years. Very recently the accomplishments of Sister Richards were recognized when she was selected by the Salt Lake City Council of Women to be one of the seven women elected to their Hall of Fame. The Magazine is pleased to publish "For the Elect's Sake," one of her later poems. "FOR THE ELECT'S SAKE" Matthew, 24th Chapter, 22nd Verse Lula Greene Richards Oh hasten! Ye hours and days yet to be Ere from dark sin and sorrow our world shall be free. The time seems now on by the Christ's words engraved, When "Except days were shortened no flesh should be saved We sense the time speeding, while near and afar All the world seems convulsed with the spirit of war. Bombardment lays cities and nations all waste, The Designer of Evil works surely in haste. Death, famine, disaster, exulting reign, With air, lands, and seas all surcharged with the slain. "But for the Elect's sake"the Savior spake on, That the minds of His friends from despair might be drawn "Those days shall be shortened." Oh, promise divine! Friendsfriends, does '"'Elect" touch your conduct and mine? If not, let's be steadfast that standard to reach By constant improvement in actions and speech; If we've possibly gained it, let's work none the less Our part of the great world to brighten and Bless, That more of His children the Lord may protect By "shortening days" for His blessed "Elect."
