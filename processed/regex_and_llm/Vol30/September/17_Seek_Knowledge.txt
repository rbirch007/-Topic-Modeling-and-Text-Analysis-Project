Seek Knowledge IN the threshold of the new educational year in Relief Society, and in the midst of personal trials and sorrows which today form a part of life's pattern for the very great majority of Relief Society members, they will desire, perhaps more than at any other time in their lives, to draw nearer to the Lord, and, by obedience to His commandments, to better merit His blessings. In contemplation of this year's work, each member may ask herself what one thing she may do in order to grow spiritually. Certainly a fundamental law was given to man when the Lord declared, "It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance"; and the Prophet Joseph Smith said, "The principle of knowledge is the principle of salvation." One object, therefore, for which all members might strive would be to better learn the principles of salvation in order the better to live in accordance with them. The Prophet Joseph Smith has told us, "the conditions of God's kingdom are such, that all who are made partakers of that glory, are under the necessity of learning something respecting it, previous to their entering into it." As Latter-day Saints, we are candidates for the celestial kingdom, the highest kingdom of which we have any knowledge, and therefore it is essential that each one learn what Page 552 she can of its requirements and laws, in order that she may pattern her life in accordance with its laws, and thus not only prepare herself to dwell therein, but to live a full and abundant life here. The courses of study in Relief Society for the year 1943-44 offer Relief Society members a rich opportunity to gain a greater knowledge of the Gospel. If every member would prayerfully study the lessons as outlined, and the references, and then continue with her reading as her interest might lead her, she would, at the close of the year's lesson work, find herself possessed of far greater knowledge than she does at the present time. The theology lessons, based on The Articles of Faith by Dr. Talmage, will impart information which is fundamental to an understanding of the tenets of the Church. The literature lessons, Bible Literature, using the King James translation of the Bible as a textbook, will lead the student into a study of the Bible and an appreciation of its literary qualities as well. In the Messages to the Home lessons, each member will recognize basic sources of strength which will help her to carry on more valiantly, and by a study of the references for these lessons, she will be guided to the sermons and writings of our great Church leaders. The study of American history, in the social science EDITORIAL department, written from the viewpoint held by Latter-day Saints in regard to the great principle of free agency, of liberty, and of the divine influence exercised in framing our Constitution, will aid Relief Society members, as American citizens, to better uphold fundamental concepts of our Government. Let each Relief Society member, then, seek during this coming season to take greater advantage of the knowledge of spiritual matters to be gained by a study of the courses outlined for Relief Society, and resolve to increase her knowledge of eternal truth. Let her find time for such a study, though it may entail foregoing some reading of current fiction 553 and drama, and. Fewer amusements, none of whose worth can compare with the joy and satisfaction to be derived from a study of the Gospel. By thus increasing her knowledge of Church doctrine, each member will better be able to obey the admonition of Paul who said, "... Add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."M. C. S. L. D. S. Men In The Armed Service (Continued from page 533) charitycommended by Jesus. A humble profession of faith and strict adherence to standards of conduct in conformity with that faith, always, in the long run, win the respect of normal men and women. We have known many examples of this, and also of the reversethe cases of Latter-day Saint men who have lost the respect and confidence of non-Church members because these men failed to live up to the principles of their Church, or seemed to be ashamed of their Church connections and the principles for which their people stand. Firmness of faith in the right, together with stamina and moral courage to practice and to defend the right are outstanding qualities of character. Certainly no Latter-day Saint can afford to be lacking in these character qualities.
We sympathize with young men in the armed service of their country in the difficult and hazardous situation in which they are placed. Generally speaking, it is no fault of theirs. It is, however, a sign of weakness for them to let this situation lead them to become reckless as to their moral and religious obligations, and thus toward their own lasting happiness and the happiness of their loved ones. It is to be hoped that these loved ones will not be remiss in doing everything possible to encourage and strengthen their relatives and friends who have been called to face the physical and moral hazards of war.

Notes to the Field
Stake Planning Meeting Recommended During September
AS in 1942, the General Board, with the special approval of the First Presidency, again recommends that a stake planning meeting be held during the month of September, preliminary to the beginning of regular weekly meetings in October, for all stake board members, ward officers, and class leaders. It is recommended that, wherever possible, this meeting be arranged in connection with a stake priesthood meeting or a stake quarterly conference in order to keep transportation at a minimum.
The purpose of this meeting is to stimulate all phases of Relief Society work at the beginning of the 1943-44 season, to preview lesson work and other activities planned for the coming year, and to give whatever instructions and help are deemed necessary by the stake board.
We feel sure that all Relief Society officers and class leaders will greatly appreciate this privilege granted by the First Presidency of holding this special meeting for stake and ward officers in order to better prepare for the coming season's work.
Stake Relief Society presidents will please acquaint their respective stake presidents with the recommendation that this special meeting be held and arrange with them as to the most favorable time for calling the meeting. Stake Relief Society presidents are requested to send complete details of this meeting to all ward presidents as soon as possible so that good ward representation may be assured.
We are sure that stake board members will make every effort to take full advantage of this special meeting and that they will be well prepared to conduct their respective departments for ward workers at this meeting.
Ward Relief Society Conferences, November 7, 1943
CONTINUING the plan first adopted in 1942 for auxiliaries to hold special meetings and annual conferences on the evenings of Fast Sundays, the Relief Society has again been assigned the evenings of Fast Day in November and March. Fast Day in November this year will occur November 7, and the General Board recommends that this evening be used for the annual Relief Society conference.
Page 554
Ward Relief Society presidents may therefore arrange with their respective bishops for holding meetings on the evening of Fast Day in November. This is a most favorable Sunday on which to hold the ward Relief Society conference, coming as it does only one month after the opening of the regular weekly meetings in October, thus affording opportunity for previewing the lessons
NOTES TO THE FIELD
and other work, near the beginning of the educational season.
It is recommended that the conference consist of two meetingsa preliminary meeting for officers, and a general session for all Relief Society members and for all other members of the ward. In order to insure a large attendance at the general session of the conference, it is recommended that visiting teachers on their regular November visits invite all ward members to be present at this meeting and that advance announcements of the meeting be made in Relief Society and other ward gatherings. Relief Society members particularly should be urged to attend.
A suggested program for the general session of the conference, with detailed instructions for its presentation, will be mailed to each ward Relief Society president in September.

Spencer W. Kimball, The Arizona Apostle
(Continued from page 530)
zonians for his work in Church, business, civic enterprises, and service clubs, notably in Rotary. Banking was his first work, but after eight and a half years of banking experience, he resigned to purchase an interest in a small new struggling insurance business which has since become the leading insurance and realty firm in eastern Arizona. He has derived great pleasure from his farming and livestock operations as well.
The Church activities of the new member of the General Authorities have been varied and continuous. When but fourteen, he became an assistant teacher in Sunday School and while yet in high school he was appointed chorister of the stake Sunday School. He sang, for many years, in ward and stake choirs, at times substituting as organist or pianist. His missionary work under President Samuel O. Bennion, in Missouri, was one of the highlights of his life. Upon returning from his mission he became first, stake clerk in 1918, then counselor in the stake presidency in 1924, where he continued to serve until the St. Joseph Stake was divided in 1938, and he was called to be the first stake president of Mt. Graham Stake, the position he was occupying at the time of his call to the apostleship.
This is the first time in the history of the Church that an apostle has been called from Arizona, and many people in the seven Arizona stakes will rejoice in his appointment, and business and professional men will feel honored by his call.
Elder Kimball has been favored with a charming wife, who has always been helpful and understanding. Camilla Eyring is the daughter of Edward Christian Eyring and Caroline Romney who lived in Mexico until 1912. Four children have been born to the Kimballs, Spencer LeVan, a commissioned officer in the United States Naval Reserve, Olive Beth, Andrew Eyring, and Edward Lawrence. The love, consideration, and thoughtfulness manifested for each other by the members of the family

have made this family unit the pride of many admirers.
President Kimball is rugged and strong, due to his outdoor life, early hard work, and strict observance of the Word of Wisdom. Although he has worked with rough characters in mining camps and one summer as a stevedore in a Los Angeles freight yard, as well as dining with European nobility and aristocracy at which
dinners many different kinds of intoxicants were served, still, due to his strict early training, he has never tasted tea nor coffee, tobacco nor liquor.
With extreme humility, Elder Spencer Woolley Kimball will enter upon his new duties after the October conference where he will be presented for the sustaining vote of that body.

way for it. The Eagle Gate and the pillars supporting it are not being torn down.
AFTER President Young's death, his wife, Lucy Decker, whose home it had been since 1860, continued to live there until 1888 when it was acquired by John W. Young.* He took down the story-and-a-half on the north and built three floors, bringing the new addition to the same height as the original building. Many rooms were added, the most important being the large east entrance hall and the spacious back parlor. A heavy carved oak Dutch door was installed at the main entrance and the original door was used for the State Street entrance. The hall was panelled with maple and elaborate mirrored mantels and lighting fixtures were installed. Wide doorways with folding doors were arranged to connect six of the large rooms on the main floor. From the south wall of the front parlor through the wide entrance hall to the north wall of the back parlor was

a length of 75 feet, making the Bee Hive parlors an ideal place in which to entertain large groups.
In 1893, the house became the property of the Latter-day Saint Church and from 1899, was used as the home of the president of the Church. President Lorenzo Snow occupied it for three years. It was President Joseph F. Smith's home for seventeen years. When President Heber J. Grant became president of the Church he decided to remain in his own home on the rim of City Creek Canyon and to allow the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association to use the Bee Hive House as a home for girls who came to the city seeking employment. During the last twenty-three years, thousands of girls have found a real home within the forty-three rooms of this outstanding edifice.
The Bee Hive House has had a long useful life. It is dear to the hearts of the members of the Church as one of the few buildings of the pioneer period still standing. The years have but emphasized how well it was built. Stately, sturdy, and strong, it is fitted to serve the future as faithfully as it has served the past.
