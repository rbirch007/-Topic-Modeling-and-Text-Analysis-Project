Eighteen in August," by Roma Rose, is here reprinted by permission of the author and Collier's magazine. This story has been chosen because it is the kind of story anyone of us might - think of writing, and, at the same time, it is expertly enough done to be acceptable to a magazine that places a very high premium indeed on expertness. In considering the story, "Eighteen in August," we find that there is nothing new about the theme: the struggle between the possessive mother and her child. Many authors have capitalized on its poignancy; it Page 540 has appeared in Therecurrently, and it is within anyone's ken, for one need not leave her neighborhood to encounter it, If the choice of theme is the first step in planning the story, a rather general plot situation must next be formulated. In this story, a young man, at the one moment when he might best free himself from his mother's possessiveness, cannot tear himself away, and as a result lives a life essentially incomplete. So far, any of us could do about as well. But now the question arises as to how to tell the story. How to depict the struggle and the decision. How to dramatize the long, empty years. How to give a striking conclusion to a story in which the whole point is that nothing happensgive it short-story form, in fact. "Eighteen in August" is one answer to these questions. In a few hundred words, Mrs. Rose tells how Professor Locke diffidently persuades young Woodbridge to make the decision that offers him freedom of soul. The rest of the story leaves us alone with the Professor, who did not achieve that freedom for himself. And suddenly we see that the story of the lad is also and primarily the story of the Professor's own youth and the decision he also had to make. The turning point in his life has also SHORT-STORY WRITING been revealed and the life-long consequences of his choice. The all-important unity of the story is never threatened by this device, for it is the Professor's story from the first word. It is seen through his eyes; he creates its emotional tone. We have finished with the lad when he makes his decision. It is with the Professor that we survey the future. Unity is also insured by the clarity with which the issue is defined: the right of a son to possess his own soul. It is in no sense a plea that boys go into the army instead of medicine, that they marry before they march away, or that they ignore the advice of their mothers. And notice that the issue is defined by the characters, not lectured about by the author. Note also the care with which the author has worked to make her characters convincing even though they are types, of course, not individuals in the true sense. The mothers are charming, vigorous, companionable women, the kind who could hold intelligent sons. The young man and the old are sensitive, loyal, and conscientious, but without the emotional drive that translates feelings into action. They are also the sort whose work is absorbing enough to make an almost satisfactory substitute for other things, leaving not too much time for "quiet desperation." Another important part of the plot construction is the preparation made for the Professor's words to become a decisive factor in the boy's life. Too often a talk, a picture, a single incident will be made the deciding factor in a story without the reader's seeing why it has such power. This has been a baleful weakness in too many "moral" stories. A reader will 541 accept the fact that the right word at the right time may alter a whole life, but he certainly ought to know why it was the right word and why the time was ripe for it. Study the extreme economy of explanation, the point where the unskillful writer so often bogs down. It would be an excellent exercise to expand this story, to discover whether its effectiveness would be increased by more detail. The sparseness of description may bother you, and again, it would be instructive to amplify it and compare results. (And here it might be mentioned parenthetically, that the stories in the files of the Magazine reveal that Utah women have a feeling for atmosphere, for the homely, memorable detail, for the color of every-day living that lends authenticity to many an otherwise almost formless nartrative. It is a gift to cultivate, never to sacrifice to glibness and stock phrases. ) In writing this story, of course, Mrs. Rose was working under the severe restrictions imposed by the short-short story''a most difficult form' she writes, and one which too often emerges a sketch or incident. It will be interesting to decide if and where she might have expanded it under different length requirements, or whether it has the "inevitable length" that Somerset -Maugham uses as one test of a good story. And when you come to the end of "Eighteen in August" pause long to admire the ending. It's hard to get a story of this kind ended effectively. When an author sums up a story in so perfect a bit of dramatic irony, we take off our hats to a job well done. 542 Along with any plea for aspiring writers to struggle to master the techniques of their craft, a warning should be sounded against too much devotion to the authors who have achieved publication with deft, "smart" writing which has little else to recommend it. This cheapening of talent can be followed in its stages by reading the groping but impassioned early work of some of our living American writers, and then comparing it with their deft but unmoving and insignificant current stories. They are like people who acquire social aplomb at the expense of character and individuality. For although sincerity, an honest point of view, and genuine emotion cannot, in and of themselves, make good stories, no stories can be worth the writing without them.

Of 137," the woman was saying, "he can carry this schedule. That leaves Saturday afternoons and Tuesdays and Thursdays from four to six for his laboratory work, and, of course, Sundays." She was the mother of one of his studentsa tall, handsome woman with straight black brows in a strong and intelligent face. She had come to get her son through his premedical course in two years instead of three, so that he would be deferred from the draft as a full medical student as soon as he was eighteen. Professor Locke glanced again at the record of George Woodbridge on the desk before him. Nothing but A's and B's. One of his best students. "It might be possible," he said. "But I don't think it is advisable." "Nonsense," Mrs. Woodbridge said, looking at him with a contradicting stare. "He hasn't been doing so well lately." "He's worried, naturally," she said. "Once we get this settled, he'll be all right." "T don't believe he can do it even if I were to allow him to try. But I'll go into the matter thoroughly. His transcripteverything. I do not feel justified in giving my consent without considering the entire case." She rose to go. "I know you won't be too academic about this, Professor. It is more than just a matter of credits and points." She managed a smile, charming, persuasive. '"'As long as I live, I will feel that you have saved my son for me." "I will consider it carefully," he said. "Goodby, Mrs. Woodbridge." Professor Locke walked down the hall and found young Woodbridge in the laboratory. "Mr. Woodbridge, EIGHTEEN IN AUGUST I want to speak to you. As soon as vou can, come into my office." The young man_ straightened. "Yes, sir. J can come now." He had smooth, light brown hair, and he ran his hand over it. His eyes were gray and larger than his mother's. He must resemble his father, Professor Locke thought. "Your mother has been here." The young man blushed as he walked along. "She said she was coming in." "So you want to hurry up and be a doctor?" "Wellyes, sir." At the office, the young man opened the door for Professor Locke and then followed him inside. "Sit down, Mr. Woodbridge. What made you want to study medicine?" "Well, I always knew that's what I was going to do. My mother and I have talked about it and planned for it since I was a kid." Professor Locke fingered the paperweight on his desk. "Let's seeyou'll be eighteen in August... How do you feel about going into the Army?" The boy breathed once before he lifted his eyes. His features, clearcut though they were, now blurred with indecision. "I really don't know, sir." There was a pause. "It doesn't seem like the Great Adventure, certainly. And I'm not attracted by any of the hero stuffbut I keep feeling" He hurried now, faster as he went"I keep feeling I ought to go. I'm not married. I'm not prepared for my profession yet. What I mean is: I haven't as much to lose as most of them." 543 "So you've decided" Professor Locke prompted helpfully. The boy flushed. "But my mother" he said. "And of course, as she says, we'll be needing doctors after it's over. It can't last forever." He swallowed. "Tll do my best, sir, to carry the work." "T'm sure you would." Professor Locke paused. "In your own mind, though, you think you should go. Is that right?" "T don't know for sure. But I'm afraid that's the way it looks to me." He put both his feet firmly on the floor. "Sometimes," Professor Locke said, "it is difficult to distinguish between responsibility and dependency in our relations with our fellow human beings." The young man was thoughtful. "I'm not sure I know what you mean, sir." "Whether we are responsible for them, or dependent on them," the professor explained. "The distinction is fine." For the first time in years, he could remember Katharine's face clearly as they stood on the steps of the Chemistry Building that spring night in 1917. And the bitterness in her voice as she had said, "I know why she wants us to wait until you come back... But it's not her life. It's yours and mine." "The distinction is fine," he said again. "Sometimes almost indistinguishable." The boy looked at him, puzzled, trying to understand. Professor Locke knew that look well. "I talk like a bad textbook," he said and laughed in his classroom manner. "Let me put it this way: 544 It is exceedingly difficult to hurt those whom we love, or who love us." He knew he was hiding behind words but he was getting closer. "Yes, sir. It is." So difficult, Professor Locke thought, looking at this boy's face, at the uncertainty in his young eyes, that he will not be able to do it alone. "What I am trying to say to you, George, is this: In the life of nearly every man, there comes a time when he must say no to his mother. When his own judgment must be his only guide." "You really think so, sir?" The boy's voice was hopeful. "I know it." The professor did not move until the words had come, harshly. Then he leaned back in his chair, stiff and brittle... old. "I'm glad to hear you say that, sir. I believe that, too. But my mother " He hesitated. "She's pretty determined. It won't be easy." I could settle it, Professor Locke thought quickly. I could say: No, he can't carry this heavy schedule. He's too young. But that's not the point. "It's up to you, Woodbridge," he said. For one long, wavering moment, the boy sat there. He ran his hand nervously over his smooth brown hair. Then it was over. "Ill do it," he said quietly, surely. He got up. "I don't know how. It will be awful. But thank you, sir." He took a step to the door. "Thank you, sir." Professor Locke came around the desk. "I am not sending you out to die," he said, self-conscious at his own seriousness. "That is not my decision to make. Nor yours. This is something else. I don't know if you understand, but I admire you. I hope you will come back. I'd like to see you finish here. Good luck, Mr. Woodbridge." He put out his hand, and the young man clasped it. ROFESSOR LOCKE sat down slowly. His heart was pounding. He was very tired, but he must get home now; he was expected. He was never later than five o'clock. He filled his brief case with orderly stacks of papers. He buttoned his overcoat carefully to the top and went out. ' His mother was waiting in her chair, her thick white hair lookin vigorous and handsome and wel kept. Her knitting lay in her lap. He bent and touched his lips to the cheek she offered. "And how was it today, son?" She was always so interested in everything he did. "Did you have a hard day? You look tired." "No," he said. "I had a good day." "I'm so glad. What happened?" "Nothing." Usually he told her the little high lights, arranging them with care, making them seem important. "I had some conferences... One of my best students is going into the Army." "What a shame!" She sighed and picked up her knitting. "You know, dear," she said, "I'm so thankful that you're over the draft age. I couldn't let you go. You're all I've got." She gave him a bright, loving smile. "Yes. Mother,' he said. "And you're all I've got." He went into his study and closed the door.
