THE CONSTITUTION
BY an Act of Congress, March 27, 1939, the Sunday immediately preceding the seventeenth day of September, each year, has been designated as Constitution Day. The following excerpts from the Doctrine and Covenants and from the Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith set forth the position which Latter-day Saints take in regard to the Constitution of the United States:
"... It is not right that any man should be in bondage one to another.
"And for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose, and redeemed the land by the shedding of blood." Doctrine and Covenants, Sec. 101:79-80.
"Have mercy, O Lord, upon all the nations of the earth; have mercy upon the rulers of our land; may those principles, which were so honorably and nobly defended, namely, the Constitution of our land, by our fathers, be established forever."Doctrine and Covenants, Sec. 109:54.
The Constitution of the United States is a glorious standard; it is founded in the wisdom of God. It is a heavenly banner; it is to all those who are privileged with the sweets of liberty, like the cooling shades and refreshing waters of a great rock in a thirsty and weary land. It is like a great tree under whose branches men from every clime can be shielded from the burning rays of the sun. Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p. 147.

The Cover
"THE GOLDEN GLOW AND THE COMBINATION FENCE" T. J. Howells, M. D.
MANY years ago across the street east from the old Salt Lake Theatre, there was located a small manufacturing company where the western "combination fence" was made. This was a lath and wire fence used to enclose the pastures and gardens of early pioneer homes. The industry was started by Bishop Robert T. Burton and the fence, usually red in color made of fir lath, became instantly popular throughout the intermountain country.
This month's cover, featuring a picture of a section of this historic fence with golden glow, is characteristic of our intermountain country as are the sagebrush and the mountains. The golden glow is a showy fall blooming flower, widely grown both in the United States and Canada. This old-fashioned ornamental plant reaches a height of between four and seven feet; generous with its bloom, this hardy flower withstands our winters and grows along the fences and the walls and in the gardens of many of our pioneer homes.
