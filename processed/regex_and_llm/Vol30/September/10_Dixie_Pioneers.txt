Dixie Pioneers Florence Ivins Hyde MOST stories of pioneer life depict the conquering of a wilderness by men and women who trekked through snows, forded treacherous rivers, climbed mountainsides, ate the dust of the desert, fought starvation, and drank the brackish waters of new lands, and, for the most part, they never turned back. We sometimes wonder, why they didn't. The Dixie pioneers of Utah were no exception to the rule. In the ride between Salt Lake City and St. George, as one drinks in the beauty of the peach and cherry blossoms, the rock formations, unsurpassed in coloring, it is difficult to realize the sacrifice that went into the roads that make this pleasure possible. Only a few years ago there were no roads. They had to be made as the people went along, and only the stout of heart could survive the difficulties. Still, their pioneer life was not all tragedy. There was some romance and some humor, but these were the "purple patches" of their lives. For 'the most part, their way was long and weary, and life was a constant struggle. Perhaps the women of this group felt the hardships the most. They saw their husbands grow old before their time. They watched their children die young, and there were times when they heard their children cry for food. But through it all they stood by their men. One woman has said that more than once she had decided to "'set her husband up" for taking them into such an undesirable place, but when he would come home at night, he "looked so tired she hadn't the heart." The life experiences of my own grandparents and parents are typical of a class among the Mormons of that time. They hardly became settled in one place before they were called to settle a new place: always trying to make something from nothing. To us who live in this world of ultra-sophistication, the stories of this pioneer life appear like the grimmest reality. In those early days the journey from Salt Lake to St. George, which now can be made in eight hours, required four weeks. Each night the tents had to be pitched, beds made down, and food cooked. Occasionally it became necessary to "lay over" a day to wash clothes and bake bread, which had to be done in a small bake skillet. Sometimes they were delayed because their horses and oxen sank in the mud, and it was with great difficulty that they were rescued. In certain places quicksand was encountered from which the animals were never recovered. In case of a storm they must spend a day drying their bedding over the bushes. Journeying farther South, the sun grew hot, the wind dry, dust and sand and more dust and sand, but through it all they journeyed on. Some of those original pioneers were men and women who had known the comforts that comparative wealth can give. A Page 545 546 few were of the type who could never take root in new soil, but, on the whole, these Dixie pioneers never questioned the wisdom of their choice in following the command of their leaders. As they prepared for their journey into the South in 1861, their instructions were to "travel light." 'Their leader, Erastus Snow, my grandfather, said to them: I do not feel that it will be wisdom for us to load ourselves down with household furniture, but if a woman wishes to take her rocking chair along, let her take it, for that will probably make her more comfortable than any other article of furniture. I wish our brethren to supply themselves with tools to work in the ground, such as spades, shovels, picks, etc. We can find plenty of timber for making bedsteads and other articles of furniture. He asked to have a carding machine taken, as well as any musical instruments, music books or school books that the people could collect. Their instructions were to locate at the junction of the Santa Clara and Virgin Rivers, and by the time they reached Black Volcanic Ridge, it was apparent that they had a difficult problem to solve. It was here that they unloaded and dismantled their wagons, letting them down over the cliffs, one part after another. It was here, too, that the wife of Johnny Pym, an English convert, gave birth to a child. Both the mother and child were let down over the ridge. One wonders how these pioneers endured those first hard years in southern Utah. For thirty years they fought the elements, before they finally subdued them. Their crops dried up because no rain came in time, or too much rain brought floods which destroyed their dams. But when these dams went out, others were built. At one time it rained forty days. Rivers and creeks overflowed their banks carrying along barns, homes, furniture, even men, women, and children, some of whom were never rescued. But Erastus Snow's motto was, "Remain and conquer." He said: Never travel without a shovel no matter where you go. And if you see a rock that should be removed, remove it, and if you see a low place that needs to be filled, get out and throw in some dirt. Hardly were their tents pitched before they laid their plans for a permanent settlement with houses, corrals, and fences. My grandfather, Israel Ivins, had surveyed the land so that the allotments could be made. Men were sent to scout out a road into the mountains in order to obtain wood, cedar, and pine, for furniture. Every male over fourteen years of age was required to work three days each year in improving roads. All kinds of artisans had been called to Dixie by Brigham Young, masons, blacksmiths, painters, plasterers, and carpenters. One man they called '""Chairmaker Bleak," who was an artist in his line. The beds were four-poster beds with rope springs, on which were laid straw or cornhusk mattresses, or if a family was lucky, a feather bed. Chairs were built with rawhide seats. The people lived in tents and wagons, often sleeping in beds wet by the rain. If the sun shone next day, the bedding was hung on bushes to dry. These tents were called Sibleytents and were round, with two doors opposite each other. As time went DIXIE PIONEERS 547 ERASTUS SNOW, LEADER OF THE DIXIE PIONEERS, AND ELIZABETH ASHBY SNOW, HIS WIFE, WITH THEIR FIRST CHILD, ELIZABETH SNOW (MRS. ANTHONY W. IVINS) on, Grandfather Snow found it necessary to build a little room back of one door for an extra bedroom. That winter President Young came down and occupied that room. Mother tells of being awakened in the night by a terrific wind, and seeing grandma standing in the middle of the tent holding up the pole, while grandfather drove deeper the stakes that held the ten. This tent room served as living room, dining room, and bedroom. In summer, the family cooked, washed, ironed, and ate outside in a bowery covered with grapevines. Often, just at meal time, a strong wind would come up, filling the food with sand.  DURING these early years the mail came through only once in several weeks. After the outbreak of the Civil War, the war news came on strips of paper of different colors, about eight inches wide and one yard long. They were called telegrams. Grandfather Snow subscribed for these telegrams, and when they arrived, the men would come together in his tent where the news was read by Brother Bleak, who "was-a very good reader." The struggle which took so much from the people physically, developed their resourcefulness, and they really enjoyed solving many of their problems. When they first arrived, their children's dresses were made from wagon covers colored with dye made from "dockroot," logwood, and blueing. In dyeing wool, if they wanted it variegated in color, strings 548 were tied tightly around the yarn at intervals. Until a woolen factory was established in the nearby town of Washington, the mothers spun the yarn and wove it into cloth for their children's clothes, or they learned to make over dresses from used ones sent them by relatives in faraway places. As they became more prosperous, the little girls wore red flannel skirts and white blouses called "posies," blouses with little peplums. Caps for the children were made of numerous layers of paper pasted together and shaped over a little brass kettle, then covered with bits of cloth. Hats for men were made from the gleanings from the wheat fields. My grandmother would braid and sew a man's hat in one day and sell it for five dollars to the gold seekers who passed on their way to California. She would, also, make by hand, in one day, a man's stiff shirt with a tucked bosom, which she would sell for seven dollars. For the first few years, the most serious problem was that of food, which was so scarce the people rarely had enough to eat. The few cows in * the town were called for in the morning by boys who took them into the hills where there was a little grass, and who brought them back at night. Sometimes the children had to wait a long time for the cow to come, and when she did come, they often got "no more than a teacupful of milk apiece." Sometimes the cow strayed away and did not get home at all, and the children went to bed hungry. Breakfast consisted of corn bread and bran coffee, and supper of cornmeal mush. Later, after the flour mill was built, they had griddle cakes made of biscuit dough rolled thin and fried in butter. The hot summers made it almost impossible to keep food palatable. Milk would not keep sweet from morning until night. The butter would melt, the water was warm. All the housewife could do to cool the water was to wrap the water barrel in a wet blanket or carpet. The family dipper always hung on the side of the barrel. Occasionally, relatives from Salt Lake would send a few dried beans or apples. Always. Tucked away in the sack would be found a box of needles or pins, or a spool of thread. The first store was established by men from California, in the basement of the Snow house, called the "Big House." The men were boarded by my grandmother who lived upstairs. When Christmas came, they wished to make her a "nice" present, so gave her the "makings of a rice puddingtrice, eggs, and raisins"; she furnished the milk. FROM the very beginning these pioneers tried to have a school, even while they lived in tents. Sister Everett and later Sister Snell taught the children to read. My father tells about the boys crawling under the sides of the school tent and running away. "But," he says, "the girls never ran away." The great teacher of the time was Richard Horne. He did for these little children of Dixie what Karl G., Maeser did for the adults of the Church. These early days produced some unique characters, one of whom was "Aunt Mary Gates," a sister of Erastus Snow and wife of Jacob Gates. She had no children of her own, but DIXIE PIONEERS gathered the children of the town around her, and taught them Greek and Roman history, and even astronomy, which she tried to explain by using apples and sometimes oranges for the planets. She developed a unique philosophy. She would declare: Why dress children up and then scold them if they get dirty?... Why iron sheets in hot weather? Why not fold them up and sit on them? It is a great accomplishment to know what to slight.... When a person cooks one chicken for fifteen people, she should make plenty of gravy. No small problem was that of the pioneers' relationship with the Indians, who resented the coming of the white man and on several occasions waylaid travelers and murdered them. Grandfather's method of dealing with them was similar to that of Brigham Young's. When Indians came into St. George in crowds, he would kill a beef and divide it among them. He largely solved the Indian problem, for no one, with the exception of Jacob Hamblin, had greater influence with them. At one time when they were boys, my father and Uncle Willard Snow did not return from a rabbit hunt. Jacob Hamblin went with a group to hunt for them, finding them prisoners at an Indian camp. When he told the Indians that one boy was a son of Erastus Snow, they immediately released them. Old Mokiac was a patriarch, the chief of the Piutes. He had two sons, Mokiac and Limpy, who was crippled. Both were "mean." One day Mokiac appeared at President Snow's home and asked his wife for food. She gave him meat, and bread and butter. Then he demanded tea. She 549 said she had none, whereupon he pulled out his knife and flourished it about to frighten her. Fortunately, her son walked in and the Indian left; but Erastus Snow demanded of Old Mokiac that his son be punished, not by the whites, but by the Indians themselves. He was brought into the town by them and tied to the Liberty Pole where his father whipped him with a black whip, while the people looked on. AS the years passed by, the people began to have more conveniences and could think more of parties, of dramatics, and various types of entertainment. But many of the men who had helped to make this entertainment possible, never lived to see that day. At one time Erastus Snow reported to the Authorities of the Church that they had thirty or forty young widows who would have to rear their families alone. One man who had been "called" refused to stay, saying he would not give up his farm up north for the whole of southern Utah. Brother Adams, the poet laureate, wrote a song about it for one of the gatherings, wherein he sang, "He measured Mormon Dixie by the breadth of his thumbnail." Those pioneers of Dixie conquered the wilderness as other pioneers have done. It was a physical struggle to conquer physical obstacles. That strange mysterious thing which prompts men and women to answer the call of duty buoyed them up. They did not want pity nor ask for glory. They left their sons and daughters as a monument to their lives. Many places in the town today have stories behind themwhere they (Continued on page 559) Chastity The following statements are reprinted herewith because of the vital present-day need for the message which they contain: President Joseph F. Smith soTHERE are at least three dangers that threaten the Church within.... As I see these they are the flattery of prominent men in the world, false educational ideas, and sexual impurity. "But the third subject mentionedpersonal purity, is perhaps of greater importance than either of the other two. We believe in one: standard of morality for men and women. If purity of life is neglected, all other dangers set in upon us like the rivers of waters when the flood gates are opened." Gospel Doctrine, pp. 391-392. President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. CHASTITY is fundamental to our life and to our civilization. If the race becomes unchaste, it will perish. Immorality has been basic to the destruction of mighty nations in the past. It will bring to dust the mighty nations of the present. ) "Fyvery one of us who instructs our youth, in whatever place or position, and in whatever capacity, must teach the young people of today to abstain from unchastity. We must surround our teachings with due and proper reserve and modesty. We must approach and teach the youth as the children of God, with spirits that are to live throughout eternity, and tell them plainly and clearly that the laws of God, and of man also, demand that they live chaste. If we shall teach anything less than this, we will destroy our youth and we will bring ourselves under a condemnation which is too great to be fathomed by the human mind. "In what I have said I include all of us parents. How can we parents face our Maker if we have failed in one featherweight to meet the duty which is ours in these matters? And let us not make the mistakeany of usof assuming that our children are beyond temptation and may not fall. This is a delusion and a snare that will bring us to the very depths. Let every father and every mother, every brother and every sister, stand guard day and night that their loved ones be not seized and carried away by lust. "You young people, may I directly entreat you to be chaste. Please believe me when I say that chastity is worth more than life itself. This is the doctrine my parents taught me; it is truth. Better die chaste than live unchaste. The salvation of your very soul is concerned in this."From an address delivered at the 109th Semi-annual Conference. Page 550
