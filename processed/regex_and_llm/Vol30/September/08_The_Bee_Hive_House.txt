The Bee Hive House
Rachel G. Taylor
NINETY years ago when the Bee Hive House was being built, with its spacious rooms, lovely recessed windows, and dignified encircling porch, it must have appeared as a veritable palace to the pioneers. From its outlook tower was afforded an unobstructed view of the entire valley. New trains of emigrants could be seen as soon as they emerged from Emigration Canyon, and Indian bands detected when still many miles away.
Although 1855 is given as the date of the completion of the house, brief entries in the journal of Truman O. Angell, architect, show that it was planned early in 1852. The first mention of Brigham Young's new house was made January 7, 1852. This entry gives a glimpse of the many projects under way at that time:
... the president then asked what jobs on hand not finished that we expected to finish in 1852. He then names the Tabernacle, Eldredge House, Benson, Parley P. Pratt's, L. T. Johnson, B. Young barn, B. Young office, barn on the Church farm, State House, wall around Temple Square, if possible build a house for the historian and one for Brigham Young.
Other entries concerning the house are found under the dates:
February 3-4, '52Took minutes for plan of Brigham Young's house.
February 7-15I have been engaged on a multitude of subjects. The chief of which was on the governor's house, making out the design &C.
April 28, '53Called for the earth to be cleared of rubbish that I might stake out the president's house.

May 3, '53Laid out the president's house or found the corners... The wind blew too much to proceed further. Left the work and went to my office, made ready the bill for timber and joists for said house.
May 4, '53Been this day, until four o'clock afternoon, sticking stakes for various partitions and showing the workman where and how to trace them at digging out the earth.
May 9, '53Continued the design of details of the president's house. It is to be a good house.
May 16thThis day I have been at the design of the observatory of the president's house.
Nov. 25, '53I went from my room to the president's house to take the oversight of the erection. I found it my duty to act as the foreman of the mason work as the building was difficult to build.
A reference telling of the completion of the Bee Hive House is found in a letter of August 3rd, 1855, written by Heber C. Kimball and published in the Millennial Star, November 17, 1855. He gives many details of progress in Zion, one item stating that:
President Young's first big house is now finished and complete and also the Church office. They are now putting the shingles on his second big house and they will have it enclosed this week.
An early application of the name "Bee Hive" to his house, before it was built, is found in the Journal History:
July 9, 1852Thomas Bullock commenced clerking in my new office, immediately west of my "Bee-Hive Mansion." (History of Brigham Young, page 62.)
It would appear from these two references that the governor's office

was built before the president's office. A careful study of an old photograph of the Bee Hive, Lion House, and Church Office buildings from the files in the Historian's Office, reveals some interesting facts. There is no date on the picture, but as the Lion does not appear on the battlement porch, it was taken before Oct. 31, 1855 as the Deseret News, volume 5, page 269, of that date, tells of the placement of the Lion. The picture shows that the office buildings, which for long years have been one unit, were originally two buildings. A magnifying glass reveals the inscription "Governor's Office" on one building and "President's Office" and "Tithing Office" on the other. The picture shows the original size of the Bee Hive House with the north portion of the building only a story and a half high. Across the front of the roof is a decorative motif, later removed.
The spacious two-story porch with its colonial columns is one of the outstanding features of this house today. Yet for almost twenty years the upstairs porch had no roof. A picture of the first bicycle made in Utah, in 1872, taken near the Eagle Gate, shows the porch of the Bee Hive House having its round posts changed to square pillars and being carried up the two full stories.
In building the Bee Hive House, cut granite was used for the foundation, red sandstone for flagging, steps, and cellar floors. The 24-inch walls and 15-inch main partitions were of sun-baked adobe, while pine from nearby canyons furnished the heavy timbers and the wood for inside trim. The outside walls were plastered and tinted a straw color. The woodwork was painted white. Green shutters were hung on all large windows.
THE most detailed and enlightening description of this house has been given by Clarissa Young Spencer, a daughter of Brigham Young,

whose home was within its walls until six years after her marriage. Her account makes it possible to visualize some of the rooms and their furnishings.*
On either side of the wide front door were tall panel windows with small panes of glass. There was a beautiful silver doorknob and an ingenious metal slide that rang a doorbell of highly resounding quality. The entrance was in the center of the south wall and a wide hall extended the length of the main building. At the north end was a long staircase with native or grained mahogany balustrade. The

walls of the hall were painted to represent great blocks of marble in shades of tan and brown. The woodwork was grained to represent oak. The stair carpet was held in place by German silver stair rods. A lamp on the newel posts supplied light at night.
Off the hall to the right was one of the two spacious parlors of the home. It had recessed windows on the south and east. The walls were painted a soft green and the floor was covered with a three-ply ingrain carpet. A high mantel piece was built between the east windows. A coal-oil lamp at each end of the mantel supplied the light. On each side of the clock in the center was a china dog with long brown ears. A

BRIGHAM YOUNG'S BEDROOM AS IT APPEARS TODAY
large drop-leaf table stood in the middle of the room. A secretary was placed on the north wall and a square United Makers grand piano. On the west one. Comfortable chairs with cherry stain and gold trim made especially for the house were to be found in front of each window, and about the center table. There were small chairs for the children. This room was used as a sitting room as well as a parlor. It was the place President Young ate his morning meal. Dinner was eaten at four-thirty each day with his families in the Lion House.
President Young's bedroom was opposite the parlor. The woodwork was grained oak, the wall a soft pink. It had two recessed windows with Nottingham curtains. A wall mirror and his washstand were between them. On the west wall were the doors leading to his office, a "Lady Franklin" stove and a wall cupboard where, among other things, he kept rock candy and raisins as a treat for his children. A large chair, a table, secretary and bed, with a bedside table and high brass candlesticks completed the furnishings.
On the second floor was the main parlor and the blue and pink bedrooms. The pink room was Clarissa's. The woodwork was grained in bird's-eye maple. This room was sixteen feet square. In recent years the high ceiling has been lowered five feet.
The parlor, or "Long Hall" as it was called, faced southeast on the second floor. This had a fine coved ceiling with modeled plaster molding running the length of the room. The floor was covered with
538
a pale gray carpet with a pattern of bunches of roses and green leaves. There were lace curtains and rose-colored lambrequins on gold cornices at the windows. Underneath a large mirror in a beautiful gold frame was a table containing a basket of flowers made of colored shells. Two "Lady Franklin" stoves supplied the heat. Two large couches constructed so that when pushed together they made a fine bed, some rocking chairs, and decorated straight wooden chairs completed the furnishings. Light was furnished from the coal-oil lamps with attractive frosted shades of two chandeliers hanging from the lofty ceiling.
The stairway leading to the top
floor was circular. Here there were two garret rooms just alike. In each was a half diamond-shaped window. From the east room a short flight of steps led to the observatory tower on which stood the beehive. The narrow rail-enclosed roof platform extended the width of the house. The Journal History of July 4, 1867, page 7, tells of a band playing from this elevated spot as part of the day's celebration.
The addition at the north of the house was a story and a half. There were located the buttery, "the men's dining room," the big kitchen, bedrooms, and the room housing the family store. The dining room was heated in early days by a fireplace, later replaced by a stove. A large table surrounded by chairs stood in the center. At each end of the table was a six-inch pedestal holding a coal-oil lamp. A bright rag carpet laid over straw covered the floor. At the north end was a built-in bake oven.
Back of the dining room was the kitchen. It had all the conveniences available at that time. There was a washstand with a roller towel, a looking glass, and a tin wash basin. There was a large sink completely lined with tin by the kitchen door. Outside that door the waste water was thrown into a sunken stone square with an outlet that emptied into a cesspool, later a drain from the sink to the hopper was built. The kitchen had deep cupboards reaching to the ceiling with space underneath for wood box and later for coal hods. Next was a large cook stove, then another set of cupboards from floor to ceiling with drawers for towels and table linens, and shelves for pots and pans. Two large tables with chairs at each

end provided working space. Both the dining room and kitchen walls were whitewashed.
The stairways to the cellar and upper story led from the men's dining room. In the large cool stone-flagged cellar were cupboards filled with great earthen jars of preserves. There were swinging shelves for the milk pans and a long table with a large polished stone slab for making piecrust in summer.
From cellar to garret there were, in all, fourteen rooms in the original home.
The outside of the house was not neglected. Besides a beautiful flower garden there were extensive vegetable gardens and an orchard of fruit trees extending some distance to the east. A high cobblestone wall with tapering circular pillars at regular intervals was built around all of President Young's property. The Eagle Gate, erected in 1859, was the main carriage entrance.
"One very fine carriage used only on state occasions, was housed on the southeast corner of the enclosure between the cobblerock wall and the Eagle Gate.... The carriage was run into the carriage house on heavy planks which were laid over a shallow tank of water. An elevated trough carried the water into this tank and was used for washing the carriage and emptied into the running stream."*
This stone wall remained until a year after President Young's death. The Journal History of December 16, 1878, page 2, states: The last two or three weeks an iron 'ornamental fence has been put in front of President B. Young's Bee-Hive House, the wall having been torn down to make (Continued on page 556) "Information gleaned from manuscript, "The Bee Hive House 1854-1888," by Clarissa Young Spencer and her book, One Who Was Valiant, Spencer-Harmer. Short-story Writing Pear] Spencer Department of English, Logan Senior High School Another article on Short-story Writing by Pearl Spencer appeared in the June-July issue of the Magazine, page 389. DITORS agree that the chief difference between the gifted amateur and the writer who gets his stories published is not sincerity, understanding, or keen observation, for in any of these an amateur may be actually superior to a given professional. No, one must have another qualification to win prizes or sell storiesa technique. Having learned how to use material effectively, a writer may produce good, bad, or mediocre stories, according to her conscience and talents; but at least she'll have a possibility of marketing them. Until she has acquired a technique, however, she must be satisfied with the plaudits of loyal friends and the joy of writing for the fun of it. To point out some of the elements of short-story technique, "Eighteen in August," by Roma Rose, is here reprinted by permission of the author and Collier's magazine. This story has been chosen because it is the kind of story anyone of us might - think of writing, and, at the same time, it is expertly enough done to be acceptable to a magazine that places a very high premium indeed on expertness. In considering the story, "Eighteen in August," we find that there is nothing new about the theme: the struggle between the possessive mother and her child. Many authors have capitalized on its poignancy; it Page 540 has appeared in Therecurrently, and it is within anyone's ken, for one need not leave her neighborhood to encounter it, If the choice of theme is the first step in planning the story, a rather general plot situation must next be formulated. In this story, a young man, at the one moment when he might best free himself from his mother's possessiveness, cannot tear himself away, and as a result lives a life essentially incomplete. So far, any of us could do about as well. But now the question arises as to how to tell the story. How to depict the struggle and the decision. How to dramatize the long, empty years. How to give a striking conclusion to a story in which the whole point is that nothing happensgive it short-story form, in fact. "Eighteen in August" is one answer to these questions. In a few hundred words, Mrs. Rose tells how Professor Locke diffidently persuades young Woodbridge to make the decision that offers him freedom of soul. The rest of the story leaves us alone with the Professor, who did not achieve that freedom for himself. And suddenly we see that the story of the lad is also and primarily the story of the Professor's own youth and the decision he also had to make. The turning point in his life has also SHORT-STORY WRITING been revealed and the life-long consequences of his choice. The all-important unity of the story is never threatened by this device, for it is the Professor's story from the first word. It is seen through his eyes; he creates its emotional tone. We have finished with the lad when he makes his decision. It is with the Professor that we survey the future. Unity is also insured by the clarity with which the issue is defined: the right of a son to possess his own soul. It is in no sense a plea that boys go into the army instead of medicine, that they marry before they march away, or that they ignore the advice of their mothers. And notice that the issue is defined by the characters, not lectured about by the author. Note also the care with which the author has worked to make her characters convincing even though they are types, of course, not individuals in the true sense. The mothers are charming, vigorous, companionable women, the kind who could hold intelligent sons. The young man and the old are sensitive, loyal, and conscientious, but without the emotional drive that translates feelings into action. They are also the sort whose work is absorbing enough to make an almost satisfactory substitute for other things, leaving not too much time for "quiet desperation." Another important part of the plot construction is the preparation made for the Professor's words to become a decisive factor in the boy's life. Too often a talk, a picture, a single incident will be made the deciding factor in a story without the reader's seeing why it has such power. This has been a baleful weakness in too many "moral" stories. A reader will 541 accept the fact that the right word at the right time may alter a whole life, but he certainly ought to know why it was the right word and why the time was ripe for it. Study the extreme economy of explanation, the point where the unskillful writer so often bogs down. It would be an excellent exercise to expand this story, to discover whether its effectiveness would be increased by more detail. The sparseness of description may bother you, and again, it would be instructive to amplify it and compare results. (And here it might be mentioned parenthetically, that the stories in the files of the Magazine reveal that Utah women have a feeling for atmosphere, for the homely, memorable detail, for the color of every-day living that lends authenticity to many an otherwise almost formless nartrative. It is a gift to cultivate, never to sacrifice to glibness and stock phrases. ) In writing this story, of course, Mrs. Rose was working under the severe restrictions imposed by the short-short story''a most difficult form' she writes, and one which too often emerges a sketch or incident. It will be interesting to decide if and where she might have expanded it under different length requirements, or whether it has the "inevitable length" that Somerset -Maugham uses as one test of a good story. And when you come to the end of "Eighteen in August" pause long to admire the ending. It's hard to get a story of this kind ended effectively. When an author sums up a story in so perfect a bit of dramatic irony, we take off our hats to a job well done. 542 Along with any plea for aspiring writers to struggle to master the techniques of their craft, a warning should be sounded against too much devotion to the authors who have achieved publication with deft, "smart" writing which has little else to recommend it. This cheapening of talent can be followed in its stages by reading the groping but impassioned early work of some of our living American writers, and then comparing it with their deft but unmoving and insignificant current stories. They are like people who acquire social aplomb at the expense of character and individuality. For although sincerity, an honest point of view, and genuine emotion cannot, in and of themselves, make good stories, no stories can be worth the writing without them. Eighteen In August By Roma Rose  Reprinted from Collier's for May 15, 1943, by permission of the author and Collier's. ROFESSOR LOCKE listened, nodding soberly from time to time. "With his 1. Q. Of 137," the woman was saying, "he can carry this schedule. That leaves Saturday afternoons and Tuesdays and Thursdays from four to six for his laboratory work, and, of course, Sundays." She was the mother of one of his studentsa tall, handsome woman with straight black brows in a strong and intelligent face. She had come to get her son through his premedical course in two years instead of three, so that he would be deferred from the draft as a full medical student as soon as he was eighteen. Professor Locke glanced again at the record of George Woodbridge on the desk before him. Nothing but A's and B's. One of his best students. "It might be possible," he said. "But I don't think it is advisable." "Nonsense," Mrs. Woodbridge said, looking at him with a contradicting stare. "He hasn't been doing so well lately." "He's worried, naturally," she said. "Once we get this settled, he'll be all right." "T don't believe he can do it even if I were to allow him to try. But I'll go into the matter thoroughly. His transcripteverything. I do not feel justified in giving my consent without considering the entire case." She rose to go. "I know you won't be too academic about this, Professor. It is more than just a matter of credits and points." She managed a smile, charming, persuasive. '"'As long as I live, I will feel that you have saved my son for me." "I will consider it carefully," he said. "Goodby, Mrs. Woodbridge." Professor Locke walked down the hall and found young Woodbridge in the laboratory. "Mr. Woodbridge, EIGHTEEN IN AUGUST I want to speak to you. As soon as vou can, come into my office." The young man_ straightened. "Yes, sir. J can come now." He had smooth, light brown hair, and he ran his hand over it. His eyes were gray and larger than his mother's. He must resemble his father, Professor Locke thought. "Your mother has been here." The young man blushed as he walked along. "She said she was coming in." "So you want to hurry up and be a doctor?" "Wellyes, sir." At the office, the young man opened the door for Professor Locke and then followed him inside. "Sit down, Mr. Woodbridge. What made you want to study medicine?" "Well, I always knew that's what I was going to do. My mother and I have talked about it and planned for it since I was a kid." Professor Locke fingered the paperweight on his desk. "Let's seeyou'll be eighteen in August... How do you feel about going into the Army?" The boy breathed once before he lifted his eyes. His features, clearcut though they were, now blurred with indecision. "I really don't know, sir." There was a pause. "It doesn't seem like the Great Adventure, certainly. And I'm not attracted by any of the hero stuffbut I keep feeling" He hurried now, faster as he went"I keep feeling I ought to go. I'm not married. I'm not prepared for my profession yet. What I mean is: I haven't as much to lose as most of them." 543 "So you've decided" Professor Locke prompted helpfully. The boy flushed. "But my mother" he said. "And of course, as she says, we'll be needing doctors after it's over. It can't last forever." He swallowed. "Tll do my best, sir, to carry the work." "T'm sure you would." Professor Locke paused. "In your own mind, though, you think you should go. Is that right?" "T don't know for sure. But I'm afraid that's the way it looks to me." He put both his feet firmly on the floor. "Sometimes," Professor Locke said, "it is difficult to distinguish between responsibility and dependency in our relations with our fellow human beings." The young man was thoughtful. "I'm not sure I know what you mean, sir." "Whether we are responsible for them, or dependent on them," the professor explained. "The distinction is fine." For the first time in years, he could remember Katharine's face clearly as they stood on the steps of the Chemistry Building that spring night in 1917. And the bitterness in her voice as she had said, "I know why she wants us to wait until you come back... But it's not her life. It's yours and mine." "The distinction is fine," he said again. "Sometimes almost indistinguishable." The boy looked at him, puzzled, trying to understand. Professor Locke knew that look well. "I talk like a bad textbook," he said and laughed in his classroom manner. "Let me put it this way: 544 It is exceedingly difficult to hurt those whom we love, or who love us." He knew he was hiding behind words but he was getting closer. "Yes, sir. It is." So difficult, Professor Locke thought, looking at this boy's face, at the uncertainty in his young eyes, that he will not be able to do it alone. "What I am trying to say to you, George, is this: In the life of nearly every man, there comes a time when he must say no to his mother. When his own judgment must be his only guide." "You really think so, sir?" The boy's voice was hopeful. "I know it." The professor did not move until the words had come, harshly. Then he leaned back in his chair, stiff and brittle... old. "I'm glad to hear you say that, sir. I believe that, too. But my mother " He hesitated. "She's pretty determined. It won't be easy." I could settle it, Professor Locke thought quickly. I could say: No, he can't carry this heavy schedule. He's too young. But that's not the point. "It's up to you, Woodbridge," he said. For one long, wavering moment, the boy sat there. He ran his hand nervously over his smooth brown hair. Then it was over. "Ill do it," he said quietly, surely. He got up. "I don't know how. It will be awful. But thank you, sir." He took a step to the door. "Thank you, sir." Professor Locke came around the desk. "I am not sending you out to die," he said, self-conscious at his own seriousness. "That is not my decision to make. Nor yours. This is something else. I don't know if you understand, but I admire you. I hope you will come back. I'd like to see you finish here. Good luck, Mr. Woodbridge." He put out his hand, and the young man clasped it. ROFESSOR LOCKE sat down slowly. His heart was pounding. He was very tired, but he must get home now; he was expected. He was never later than five o'clock. He filled his brief case with orderly stacks of papers. He buttoned his overcoat carefully to the top and went out. ' His mother was waiting in her chair, her thick white hair lookin vigorous and handsome and wel kept. Her knitting lay in her lap. He bent and touched his lips to the cheek she offered. "And how was it today, son?" She was always so interested in everything he did. "Did you have a hard day? You look tired." "No," he said. "I had a good day." "I'm so glad. What happened?" "Nothing." Usually he told her the little high lights, arranging them with care, making them seem important. "I had some conferences... One of my best students is going into the Army." "What a shame!" She sighed and picked up her knitting. "You know, dear," she said, "I'm so thankful that you're over the draft age. I couldn't let you go. You're all I've got." She gave him a bright, loving smile. "Yes. Mother,' he said. "And you're all I've got." He went into his study and closed the door. Dixie Pioneers Florence Ivins Hyde MOST stories of pioneer life depict the conquering of a wilderness by men and women who trekked through snows, forded treacherous rivers, climbed mountainsides, ate the dust of the desert, fought starvation, and drank the brackish waters of new lands, and, for the most part, they never turned back. We sometimes wonder, why they didn't. The Dixie pioneers of Utah were no exception to the rule. In the ride between Salt Lake City and St. George, as one drinks in the beauty of the peach and cherry blossoms, the rock formations, unsurpassed in coloring, it is difficult to realize the sacrifice that went into the roads that make this pleasure possible. Only a few years ago there were no roads. They had to be made as the people went along, and only the stout of heart could survive the difficulties. Still, their pioneer life was not all tragedy. There was some romance and some humor, but these were the "purple patches" of their lives. For 'the most part, their way was long and weary, and life was a constant struggle. Perhaps the women of this group felt the hardships the most. They saw their husbands grow old before their time. They watched their children die young, and there were times when they heard their children cry for food. But through it all they stood by their men. One woman has said that more than once she had decided to "'set her husband up" for taking them into such an undesirable place, but when he would come home at night, he "looked so tired she hadn't the heart." The life experiences of my own grandparents and parents are typical of a class among the Mormons of that time. They hardly became settled in one place before they were called to settle a new place: always trying to make something from nothing. To us who live in this world of ultra-sophistication, the stories of this pioneer life appear like the grimmest reality. In those early days the journey from Salt Lake to St. George, which now can be made in eight hours, required four weeks. Each night the tents had to be pitched, beds made down, and food cooked. Occasionally it became necessary to "lay over" a day to wash clothes and bake bread, which had to be done in a small bake skillet. Sometimes they were delayed because their horses and oxen sank in the mud, and it was with great difficulty that they were rescued. In certain places quicksand was encountered from which the animals were never recovered. In case of a storm they must spend a day drying their bedding over the bushes. Journeying farther South, the sun grew hot, the wind dry, dust and sand and more dust and sand, but through it all they journeyed on. Some of those original pioneers were men and women who had known the comforts that comparative wealth can give. A Page 545 546 few were of the type who could never take root in new soil, but, on the whole, these Dixie pioneers never questioned the wisdom of their choice in following the command of their leaders. As they prepared for their journey into the South in 1861, their instructions were to "travel light." 'Their leader, Erastus Snow, my grandfather, said to them: I do not feel that it will be wisdom for us to load ourselves down with household furniture, but if a woman wishes to take her rocking chair along, let her take it, for that will probably make her more comfortable than any other article of furniture. I wish our brethren to supply themselves with tools to work in the ground, such as spades, shovels, picks, etc. We can find plenty of timber for making bedsteads and other articles of furniture. He asked to have a carding machine taken, as well as any musical instruments, music books or school books that the people could collect. Their instructions were to locate at the junction of the Santa Clara and Virgin Rivers, and by the time they reached Black Volcanic Ridge, it was apparent that they had a difficult problem to solve. It was here that they unloaded and dismantled their wagons, letting them down over the cliffs, one part after another. It was here, too, that the wife of Johnny Pym, an English convert, gave birth to a child. Both the mother and child were let down over the ridge. One wonders how these pioneers endured those first hard years in southern Utah. For thirty years they fought the elements, before they finally subdued them. Their crops dried up because no rain came in time, or too much rain brought floods which destroyed their dams. But when these dams went out, others were built. At one time it rained forty days. Rivers and creeks overflowed their banks carrying along barns, homes, furniture, even men, women, and children, some of whom were never rescued. But Erastus Snow's motto was, "Remain and conquer." He said: Never travel without a shovel no matter where you go. And if you see a rock that should be removed, remove it, and if you see a low place that needs to be filled, get out and throw in some dirt. Hardly were their tents pitched before they laid their plans for a permanent settlement with houses, corrals, and fences. My grandfather, Israel Ivins, had surveyed the land so that the allotments could be made. Men were sent to scout out a road into the mountains in order to obtain wood, cedar, and pine, for furniture. Every male over fourteen years of age was required to work three days each year in improving roads. All kinds of artisans had been called to Dixie by Brigham Young, masons, blacksmiths, painters, plasterers, and carpenters. One man they called '""Chairmaker Bleak," who was an artist in his line. The beds were four-poster beds with rope springs, on which were laid straw or cornhusk mattresses, or if a family was lucky, a feather bed. Chairs were built with rawhide seats. The people lived in tents and wagons, often sleeping in beds wet by the rain. If the sun shone next day, the bedding was hung on bushes to dry. These tents were called Sibleytents and were round, with two doors opposite each other. As time went DIXIE PIONEERS 547 ERASTUS SNOW, LEADER OF THE DIXIE PIONEERS, AND ELIZABETH ASHBY SNOW, HIS WIFE, WITH THEIR FIRST CHILD, ELIZABETH SNOW (MRS. ANTHONY W. IVINS) on, Grandfather Snow found it necessary to build a little room back of one door for an extra bedroom. That winter President Young came down and occupied that room. Mother tells of being awakened in the night by a terrific wind, and seeing grandma standing in the middle of the tent holding up the pole, while grandfather drove deeper the stakes that held the ten. This tent room served as living room, dining room, and bedroom. In summer, the family cooked, washed, ironed, and ate outside in a bowery covered with grapevines. Often, just at meal time, a strong wind would come up, filling the food with sand.  DURING these early years the mail came through only once in several weeks. After the outbreak of the Civil War, the war news came on strips of paper of different colors, about eight inches wide and one yard long. They were called telegrams. Grandfather Snow subscribed for these telegrams, and when they arrived, the men would come together in his tent where the news was read by Brother Bleak, who "was-a very good reader." The struggle which took so much from the people physically, developed their resourcefulness, and they really enjoyed solving many of their problems. When they first arrived, their children's dresses were made from wagon covers colored with dye made from "dockroot," logwood, and blueing. In dyeing wool, if they wanted it variegated in color, strings 548 were tied tightly around the yarn at intervals. Until a woolen factory was established in the nearby town of Washington, the mothers spun the yarn and wove it into cloth for their children's clothes, or they learned to make over dresses from used ones sent them by relatives in faraway places. As they became more prosperous, the little girls wore red flannel skirts and white blouses called "posies," blouses with little peplums. Caps for the children were made of numerous layers of paper pasted together and shaped over a little brass kettle, then covered with bits of cloth. Hats for men were made from the gleanings from the wheat fields. My grandmother would braid and sew a man's hat in one day and sell it for five dollars to the gold seekers who passed on their way to California. She would, also, make by hand, in one day, a man's stiff shirt with a tucked bosom, which she would sell for seven dollars. For the first few years, the most serious problem was that of food, which was so scarce the people rarely had enough to eat. The few cows in * the town were called for in the morning by boys who took them into the hills where there was a little grass, and who brought them back at night. Sometimes the children had to wait a long time for the cow to come, and when she did come, they often got "no more than a teacupful of milk apiece." Sometimes the cow strayed away and did not get home at all, and the children went to bed hungry. Breakfast consisted of corn bread and bran coffee, and supper of cornmeal mush. Later, after the flour mill was built, they had griddle cakes made of biscuit dough rolled thin and fried in butter. The hot summers made it almost impossible to keep food palatable. Milk would not keep sweet from morning until night. The butter would melt, the water was warm. All the housewife could do to cool the water was to wrap the water barrel in a wet blanket or carpet. The family dipper always hung on the side of the barrel. Occasionally, relatives from Salt Lake would send a few dried beans or apples. Always. Tucked away in the sack would be found a box of needles or pins, or a spool of thread. The first store was established by men from California, in the basement of the Snow house, called the "Big House." The men were boarded by my grandmother who lived upstairs. When Christmas came, they wished to make her a "nice" present, so gave her the "makings of a rice puddingtrice, eggs, and raisins"; she furnished the milk. FROM the very beginning these pioneers tried to have a school, even while they lived in tents. Sister Everett and later Sister Snell taught the children to read. My father tells about the boys crawling under the sides of the school tent and running away. "But," he says, "the girls never ran away." The great teacher of the time was Richard Horne. He did for these little children of Dixie what Karl G., Maeser did for the adults of the Church. These early days produced some unique characters, one of whom was "Aunt Mary Gates," a sister of Erastus Snow and wife of Jacob Gates. She had no children of her own, but DIXIE PIONEERS gathered the children of the town around her, and taught them Greek and Roman history, and even astronomy, which she tried to explain by using apples and sometimes oranges for the planets. She developed a unique philosophy. She would declare: Why dress children up and then scold them if they get dirty?... Why iron sheets in hot weather? Why not fold them up and sit on them? It is a great accomplishment to know what to slight.... When a person cooks one chicken for fifteen people, she should make plenty of gravy. No small problem was that of the pioneers' relationship with the Indians, who resented the coming of the white man and on several occasions waylaid travelers and murdered them. Grandfather's method of dealing with them was similar to that of Brigham Young's. When Indians came into St. George in crowds, he would kill a beef and divide it among them. He largely solved the Indian problem, for no one, with the exception of Jacob Hamblin, had greater influence with them. At one time when they were boys, my father and Uncle Willard Snow did not return from a rabbit hunt. Jacob Hamblin went with a group to hunt for them, finding them prisoners at an Indian camp. When he told the Indians that one boy was a son of Erastus Snow, they immediately released them. Old Mokiac was a patriarch, the chief of the Piutes. He had two sons, Mokiac and Limpy, who was crippled. Both were "mean." One day Mokiac appeared at President Snow's home and asked his wife for food. She gave him meat, and bread and butter. Then he demanded tea. She 549 said she had none, whereupon he pulled out his knife and flourished it about to frighten her. Fortunately, her son walked in and the Indian left; but Erastus Snow demanded of Old Mokiac that his son be punished, not by the whites, but by the Indians themselves. He was brought into the town by them and tied to the Liberty Pole where his father whipped him with a black whip, while the people looked on. AS the years passed by, the people began to have more conveniences and could think more of parties, of dramatics, and various types of entertainment. But many of the men who had helped to make this entertainment possible, never lived to see that day. At one time Erastus Snow reported to the Authorities of the Church that they had thirty or forty young widows who would have to rear their families alone. One man who had been "called" refused to stay, saying he would not give up his farm up north for the whole of southern Utah. Brother Adams, the poet laureate, wrote a song about it for one of the gatherings, wherein he sang, "He measured Mormon Dixie by the breadth of his thumbnail." Those pioneers of Dixie conquered the wilderness as other pioneers have done. It was a physical struggle to conquer physical obstacles. That strange mysterious thing which prompts men and women to answer the call of duty buoyed them up. They did not want pity nor ask for glory. They left their sons and daughters as a monument to their lives. Many places in the town today have stories behind themwhere they (Continued on page 559) Chastity The following statements are reprinted herewith because of the vital present-day need for the message which they contain: President Joseph F. Smith soTHERE are at least three dangers that threaten the Church within.... As I see these they are the flattery of prominent men in the world, false educational ideas, and sexual impurity. "But the third subject mentionedpersonal purity, is perhaps of greater importance than either of the other two. We believe in one: standard of morality for men and women. If purity of life is neglected, all other dangers set in upon us like the rivers of waters when the flood gates are opened." Gospel Doctrine, pp. 391-392. President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. CHASTITY is fundamental to our life and to our civilization. If the race becomes unchaste, it will perish. Immorality has been basic to the destruction of mighty nations in the past. It will bring to dust the mighty nations of the present. ) "Fyvery one of us who instructs our youth, in whatever place or position, and in whatever capacity, must teach the young people of today to abstain from unchastity. We must surround our teachings with due and proper reserve and modesty. We must approach and teach the youth as the children of God, with spirits that are to live throughout eternity, and tell them plainly and clearly that the laws of God, and of man also, demand that they live chaste. If we shall teach anything less than this, we will destroy our youth and we will bring ourselves under a condemnation which is too great to be fathomed by the human mind. "In what I have said I include all of us parents. How can we parents face our Maker if we have failed in one featherweight to meet the duty which is ours in these matters? And let us not make the mistakeany of usof assuming that our children are beyond temptation and may not fall. This is a delusion and a snare that will bring us to the very depths. Let every father and every mother, every brother and every sister, stand guard day and night that their loved ones be not seized and carried away by lust. "You young people, may I directly entreat you to be chaste. Please believe me when I say that chastity is worth more than life itself. This is the doctrine my parents taught me; it is truth. Better die chaste than live unchaste. The salvation of your very soul is concerned in this."From an address delivered at the 109th Semi-annual Conference. Page 550 Woman's Sphere Ramona W.

HE Academy of Western Culture recently presented to Mrs. Alice Merrill Horne a bronze medal for distinguished service in promoting the development of Utah art. Mrs. Horne's first public work was performed in preparing a course in art for 40,000 Relief Society women. This course provided study in color changes during the four seasons; the effect of light on foliage; how to design kitchens, window boxes, and home gardens; how to appreciate some of the old masters and some Americari paintings; and how to dress tastefully and to suit the personality. For fourteen years, Mrs. Horne was a member of the General Board of Relief Society and for fifty years she has worked indefatigably to further art and help artists in Utah. MBS. JEAN H.

Page 551 EDITORIAL 2 VOL. 30 SEPTEMBER 1943 Seek Knowledge IN the threshold of the new educational year in Relief Society, and in the midst of personal trials and sorrows which today form a part of life's pattern for the very great majority of Relief Society members, they will desire, perhaps more than at any other time in their lives, to draw nearer to the Lord, and, by obedience to His commandments, to better merit His blessings. In contemplation of this year's work, each member may ask herself what one thing she may do in order to grow spiritually. Certainly a fundamental law was given to man when the Lord declared, "It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance"; and the Prophet Joseph Smith said, "The principle of knowledge is the principle of salvation." One object, therefore, for which all members might strive would be to better learn the principles of salvation in order the better to live in accordance with them. The Prophet Joseph Smith has told us, "the conditions of God's kingdom are such, that all who are made partakers of that glory, are under the necessity of learning something respecting it, previous to their entering into it." As Latter-day Saints, we are candidates for the celestial kingdom, the highest kingdom of which we have any knowledge, and therefore it is essential that each one learn what Page 552 she can of its requirements and laws, in order that she may pattern her life in accordance with its laws, and thus not only prepare herself to dwell therein, but to live a full and abundant life here. The courses of study in Relief Society for the year 1943-44 offer Relief Society members a rich opportunity to gain a greater knowledge of the Gospel. If every member would prayerfully study the lessons as outlined, and the references, and then continue with her reading as her interest might lead her, she would, at the close of the year's lesson work, find herself possessed of far greater knowledge than she does at the present time. The theology lessons, based on The Articles of Faith by Dr. Talmage, will impart information which is fundamental to an understanding of the tenets of the Church. The literature lessons, Bible Literature, using the King James translation of the Bible as a textbook, will lead the student into a study of the Bible and an appreciation of its literary qualities as well. In the Messages to the Home lessons, each member will recognize basic sources of strength which will help her to carry on more valiantly, and by a study of the references for these lessons, she will be guided to the sermons and writings of our great Church leaders. The study of American history, in the social science EDITORIAL department, written from the viewpoint held by Latter-day Saints in regard to the great principle of free agency, of liberty, and of the divine influence exercised in framing our Constitution, will aid Relief Society members, as American citizens, to better uphold fundamental concepts of our Government. Let each Relief Society member, then, seek during this coming season to take greater advantage of the knowledge of spiritual matters to be gained by a study of the courses outlined for Relief Society, and resolve to increase her knowledge of eternal truth. Let her find time for such a study, though it may entail foregoing some reading of current fiction 553 and drama, and. Fewer amusements, none of whose worth can compare with the joy and satisfaction to be derived from a study of the Gospel. By thus increasing her knowledge of Church doctrine, each member will better be able to obey the admonition of Paul who said, "... Add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."M. C. S. L. D. S. Men In The Armed Service (Continued from page 533) charitycommended by Jesus. A humble profession of faith and strict adherence to standards of conduct in conformity with that faith, always, in the long run, win the respect of normal men and women. We have known many examples of this, and also of the reversethe cases of Latter-day Saint men who have lost the respect and confidence of non-Church members because these men failed to live up to the principles of their Church, or seemed to be ashamed of their Church connections and the principles for which their people stand. Firmness of faith in the right, together with stamina and moral courage to practice and to defend the right are outstanding qualities of character. Certainly no Latter-day Saint can afford to be lacking in these character qualities.
We sympathize with young men in the armed service of their country in the difficult and hazardous situation in which they are placed. Generally speaking, it is no fault of theirs. It is, however, a sign of weakness for them to let this situation lead them to become reckless as to their moral and religious obligations, and thus toward their own lasting happiness and the happiness of their loved ones. It is to be hoped that these loved ones will not be remiss in doing everything possible to encourage and strengthen their relatives and friends who have been called to face the physical and moral hazards of war.

Notes to the Field
Stake Planning Meeting Recommended During September
AS in 1942, the General Board, with the special approval of the First Presidency, again recommends that a stake planning meeting be held during the month of September, preliminary to the beginning of regular weekly meetings in October, for all stake board members, ward officers, and class leaders. It is recommended that, wherever possible, this meeting be arranged in connection with a stake priesthood meeting or a stake quarterly conference in order to keep transportation at a minimum.
The purpose of this meeting is to stimulate all phases of Relief Society work at the beginning of the 1943-44 season, to preview lesson work and other activities planned for the coming year, and to give whatever instructions and help are deemed necessary by the stake board.
We feel sure that all Relief Society officers and class leaders will greatly appreciate this privilege granted by the First Presidency of holding this special meeting for stake and ward officers in order to better prepare for the coming season's work.
Stake Relief Society presidents will please acquaint their respective stake presidents with the recommendation that this special meeting be held and arrange with them as to the most favorable time for calling the meeting. Stake Relief Society presidents are requested to send complete details of this meeting to all ward presidents as soon as possible so that good ward representation may be assured.
We are sure that stake board members will make every effort to take full advantage of this special meeting and that they will be well prepared to conduct their respective departments for ward workers at this meeting.
Ward Relief Society Conferences, November 7, 1943
CONTINUING the plan first adopted in 1942 for auxiliaries to hold special meetings and annual conferences on the evenings of Fast Sundays, the Relief Society has again been assigned the evenings of Fast Day in November and March. Fast Day in November this year will occur November 7, and the General Board recommends that this evening be used for the annual Relief Society conference.
Page 554
Ward Relief Society presidents may therefore arrange with their respective bishops for holding meetings on the evening of Fast Day in November. This is a most favorable Sunday on which to hold the ward Relief Society conference, coming as it does only one month after the opening of the regular weekly meetings in October, thus affording opportunity for previewing the lessons
NOTES TO THE FIELD
and other work, near the beginning of the educational season.
It is recommended that the conference consist of two meetingsa preliminary meeting for officers, and a general session for all Relief Society members and for all other members of the ward. In order to insure a large attendance at the general session of the conference, it is recommended that visiting teachers on their regular November visits invite all ward members to be present at this meeting and that advance announcements of the meeting be made in Relief Society and other ward gatherings. Relief Society members particularly should be urged to attend.
A suggested program for the general session of the conference, with detailed instructions for its presentation, will be mailed to each ward Relief Society president in September.

Spencer W. Kimball, The Arizona Apostle

zonians for his work in Church, business, civic enterprises, and service clubs, notably in Rotary. Banking was his first work, but after eight and a half years of banking experience, he resigned to purchase an interest in a small new struggling insurance business which has since become the leading insurance and realty firm in eastern Arizona. He has derived great pleasure from his farming and livestock operations as well.
The Church activities of the new member of the General Authorities have been varied and continuous. When but fourteen, he became an assistant teacher in Sunday School and while yet in high school he was appointed chorister of the stake Sunday School. He sang, for many years, in ward and stake choirs, at times substituting as organist or pianist. His missionary work under President Samuel O. Bennion, in Missouri, was one of the highlights of his life. Upon returning from his mission he became first, stake clerk in 1918, then counselor in the stake presidency in 1924, where he continued to serve until the St. Joseph Stake was divided in 1938, and he was called to be the first stake president of Mt. Graham Stake, the position he was occupying at the time of his call to the apostleship.
This is the first time in the history of the Church that an apostle has been called from Arizona, and many people in the seven Arizona stakes will rejoice in his appointment, and business and professional men will feel honored by his call.
Elder Kimball has been favored with a charming wife, who has always been helpful and understanding. Camilla Eyring is the daughter of Edward Christian Eyring and Caroline Romney who lived in Mexico until 1912. Four children have been born to the Kimballs, Spencer LeVan, a commissioned officer in the United States Naval Reserve, Olive Beth, Andrew Eyring, and Edward Lawrence. The love, consideration, and thoughtfulness manifested for each other by the members of the family
556
have made this family unit the pride of many admirers.
President Kimball is rugged and strong, due to his outdoor life, early hard work, and strict observance of the Word of Wisdom. Although he has worked with rough characters in mining camps and one summer as a stevedore in a Los Angeles freight yard, as well as dining with European nobility and aristocracy at which
dinners many different kinds of intoxicants were served, still, due to his strict early training, he has never tasted tea nor coffee, tobacco nor liquor.
With extreme humility, Elder Spencer Woolley Kimball will enter upon his new duties after the October conference where he will be presented for the sustaining vote of that body.

way for it. The Eagle Gate and the pillars supporting it are not being torn down.
AFTER President Young's death, his wife, Lucy Decker, whose home it had been since 1860, continued to live there until 1888 when it was acquired by John W. Young.* He took down the story-and-a-half on the north and built three floors, bringing the new addition to the same height as the original building. Many rooms were added, the most important being the large east entrance hall and the spacious back parlor. A heavy carved oak Dutch door was installed at the main entrance and the original door was used for the State Street entrance. The hall was panelled with maple and elaborate mirrored mantels and lighting fixtures were installed. Wide doorways with folding doors were arranged to connect six of the large rooms on the main floor. From the south wall of the front parlor through the wide entrance hall to the north wall of the back parlor was

a length of 75 feet, making the Bee Hive parlors an ideal place in which to entertain large groups.
In 1893, the house became the property of the Latter-day Saint Church and from 1899, was used as the home of the president of the Church. President Lorenzo Snow occupied it for three years. It was President Joseph F. Smith's home for seventeen years. When President Heber J. Grant became president of the Church he decided to remain in his own home on the rim of City Creek Canyon and to allow the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association to use the Bee Hive House as a home for girls who came to the city seeking employment. During the last twenty-three years, thousands of girls have found a real home within the forty-three rooms of this outstanding edifice.
The Bee Hive House has had a long useful life. It is dear to the hearts of the members of the Church as one of the few buildings of the pioneer period still standing. The years have but emphasized how well it was built. Stately, sturdy, and strong, it is fitted to serve the future as faithfully as it has served the past.
