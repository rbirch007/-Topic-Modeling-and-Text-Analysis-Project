They Were Called Pilgrims Vesta Crawford O many of us Thanksgiving means a feast, a time of rejoicing for the fruits of the land. This year, particularly, Thanksgiving should mean a spiritual feast as well, a reckoning with that "plenty" which is not dependent upon the harvesting of fields. We have thought of the first Thanksgiving as the celebration in 1621 when the Pilgrims prepared a feast in the wilderness. That day was associated with reaping, the gathering of crops, the storage of food for winter. It was a day of appreciation for the good things of the earth. Yet there was a deeper meaning, a memory of a previous year when there was no material thing to harvest. The very first Thanksgiving Day was not a festival it was not an autumn holiday. In December, 1620, when the Pilgrims first set foot on the shore of the New World, deep winter lay upon the land and the forest looked dark and foreboding. There was a storm at sea and a strong wind shook the stubble of Indian corn that leaned up against the hills. We might try to voice the thoughts and feelings of these wanderers who faced the winter in an alien land. The words of the English poet, Felicia Hemans, have caught the spirit of that time and place and have given us a picture that can never be forgotten: The breaking waves dashed high On a stern and rock-bound coast And the woods against a stony sky Their giant branches tossed.. And the heavy night hung dark The hills and water o'er When a band of exiles moored their bark On the wild New England shore.... The pioneer, the pilgrim; has always been faced with loneliness and hardship. We can realize this because Our direct ancestors, too, made sacrifices for religious freedom and for the opportunity to develop their own social ideals. 'There is a striking parallel that links the story of the Pilgrims with the pioneer history of our own people. There is much more to the word pilgrim than we may have realized. The direct source of the name comes from the Bible. In that Epistle wherein Paul, the Apostle, speaks to the Hebrews, it is written in the eleventh chapter: "By faith he (Abraham) sojourned in the land of promise, as in a. Strange country.... For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God. Through faith also Sara herself received strength.... These all died in faith... And confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth... They desire a better country." The New England Pilgrims, also, followed the pattern explained in the Bible, for "They sojourned in the land of promise." They set about to build homes in the wilderness "westward." There, on the edge of an unknown land, they were thankful for simple things, for the Page 661 662 earth and the streams of water, for the trees and for the light of the evening fires. "THERE is a true and graphic account of this first Thanksgiving Day written by a man who was there, Governor William Bradford. Even in the midst of the exacting demands of pioneer life, the great governor could not forget his heritage and the heritage of his people. He remembered the departure from Leyden in. The land of Holland: "So they left ye goodly and pleasante citie, which had been their resting place for near twelve years, but they knew that they were Pilgrims and looked not much ons those things but lifted up their eyes to ye heavens their dearest countrie and quieted their spirits." The long journey across the stormy Atlantic was a brave pilgrimage to a land the wanderers had never seen. Today when distance is a small thing, we cannot fully. Appreciate the loneliness of that one small ship adrift so far from home. It is difficult, even, for us to realize the loneliness of a covered wagon on the western prairies. Perhaps we have gone too far away from a time when thankfulness was an everyday rejoicing of the spirit. Governor Bradford called the Mayflower "ye dauntless ship," and he writes in detail of the arrival in the dark days of early winter. He voices relief that the sea was conquered and an abiding place had been found at last: "Being thus artived in good harbor and brought safe to land, they fell upon their knees and blessed ye God of heaven, who had brought them over ye vast and furious ocean, and delivered them from all ye perils and miseries thereof, again to set their feet on ye firm and stable earth, their proper elemente." The Pilgrims, like all pioneers, could not forget what they had left behind. The brightness and the hope of the future were not strong enough to dull the memory of home. Even on their first Thanksgiving Day, they remembered Southampton where the Mayflower came to gather up the Holland Pilgrims; they remembered Plymouth, in England, where they had looked their last upon their native land. Realizing this, Bradford expressed the solitude they felt in that small strip of land between the forest and the sea: "They had no friends to wellcome them, nor inns to entertain or refresh their weatherbeaten bodies, nor houses or much less towns to repair to, to seek for succoure." There was ice on the streams. There was no green plant nor red flower, no blade of grass nor grain. The earth was an etching of gray and brown tree trunks and white hill slopes. "And for ye season it was winter, and ye know ye winters of ye countrie, know them to be sharp and violent, and subject to cruelle and fierce storms, dangerous to travel to known places, and more to search an unknown coast. Besides what could they see but a hideous and desolate wilderness, full of willd beasts and willd men, and what multitudes there might be of them they knew not.... For summer being done all things stand upon them with a weatherbeaten face, and ye whole countrie, full of woods and thickets, represented a willd and savage hiew." THEY WERE CALLED PILGRIMS GUCH was the New England shore on that day when the cornerstone of a nation was laid in the strength of religious freedom. There was much to be thankful for, an appreciation and a memory that should extend to us every day and every year. Governor Bradford earnestly expresses a universal thought: "Our fathers came over this great ocean, and were ready to perish in the wilderness; but they cried unto ye Lord, and he heard their voice.... Let them therefore praise ye Lord because he is good-and his mercies endure forever." It is recorded that on the first 663 Thanksgiving Day there was singing. Again, the words of Felicia Hemans tell in rhythmic measures the story that Bradford wrote in simple prose:  Amidst the storm they sang And the stars heard, and the sea, And the sounding aisles of: the dim woods rang To the anthem of the free.... Is there not a parallel in this with the singing of the western pioneers of a later day? With their wagons circled around them, they, too, sang their pilgrim songs in the wilderness: Come, come, ye saints, no toil nor labor fear....
