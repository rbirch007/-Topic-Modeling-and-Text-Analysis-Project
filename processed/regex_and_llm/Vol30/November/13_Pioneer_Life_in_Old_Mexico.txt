Pioneer Life in Old Mexico Florence Ivins Hyde IONEER life in Old Mexico is one of the unique stories of Mormon historythe story of a small group, loyal to their family ties, fleeing from persecution to a place of refuge. "Refugees," they were called. It is not the usual story of pioneers trekking across great distances of desert land with the fear of death from Indians added to their other hardships, but rather one of making new homes in a strange land. The story of the Mormon colonies in Mexico is the story of the building of communities under difficult circumstances. The life of our family was typical of life in the colonies. I recall countless pleasures of those early daysI still feel the joy of long, hot afternoons spent by us children sitting on the limbs of trees eating juicy peaches, or under a_ grapevine quenching our thirst with the watery grapes; watching the birds carry sticks and strings to build their nests, or industrious ants carry tiny bits of food down into a hole in the ground for a winter store. I recall, too, the fun of eating parched corn, strips of dried venison which my father sizzled over the coals; and the unique experience of learning how to catch fleas so that we might be able to sleep. All these childhood experiences were more interesting than the winters spent in school (at that time none too good), trying to learn Spanish. They were pleasures which we enjoyed as a matter of course, with Page 666 out understanding the sacrifices made by the original settlers to make even these few things possible. What to our parents was a tremendous sactifice, was to us children only a new adventure. Years before our immediate family was called as missionaries into Mexico, my grandfather, Erastus Snow, had been sent down from Utah to purchase land for the settlement of colonies by members of the Church. Soon after, in 1885, the first "refugees," seventy in number, had crossed over the border from Snowflake, Arizona. These early pioneers suffered many of the hardships that accompany pioneer life. What they ate, they had to raise, and what they wore, they had to make. At first, they lived in tents, but as soon as possible they began to build permanent homes. In 1888, Erastus Snow had built for himself a two-story adobe house in Colonia Juarez at a cost of $1,400, "to encourage others to build good houses." It is certain that the adults in these colonies would have preferred to have remained in their homes in the United States. Many of them had already pioneered in southern Utah and Arizona; but rather than give up their family ties they undertook this strange new life. TWELVE years after the first group went into Mexico, my father was called to preside over the Mexican Mission and to organize the Mexican Agricultural and Colonization PIONEER LIFE IN OLD MEXICO Company. He had already filled two missions to the interior of Mexico; but this time he was not to spend two years there, but he was told to take his family and prepare to make his home in Mexico. The sacrifice such a move entailed cannot be understood by one who has not experienced it. His future in the United States seemed to hold the. Greatest success for him. After receiving the call from the Presidency of the Church, he rode out to his ranch on the Kaibab mountain to talk it out, as was always his custom, with himself and his horse. The greatest sacrifice was not for himself but for his wife and children. To move them away from a state that offered them the advantages of education and culture, from their families and friends, to a land which had nothing to, offer, required the greatest of courage. His diary tells of men who advised "I wouldn't go," but he and his wife decided there was nothing else for them to do. The family was to travel by train to the border but all of our "belongings" had to be taken overland. My father took over the border two mules and sixty horses (among which were two thoroughbred mares, Pearl Livingstone and Minnehaha), and old Jimmy, a horse which had grown up with our family and was now too old to be of any service, but. Also too old to be left behind. A little later he brought over a setting of white Wyandotte eggs, the first hatching to come to the colony. Our first impression of our new home came as we awoke in the morning in a hotel at the border and heard the clatter of horses' hoofs on the cobblestone street, the rattle of ROAD INTO THE MOUNTAIN COLONIES the milk wagons as they passed by, and the call of the Mexican boys, "Aqui viene la leche!" ("Here comes the milk."). Here, at the border, we met the wagons which had come overland in which we were to make the remainder of the journey. That short trip of about 100 miles over the desert into Colonia Juarez can never be forgotten. We cooked our meals over a campfire and ate them sitting on blankets on the ground or on the wagon seats. At night our parents made beds on the ground under the stars, where we were lulled to sleep by the tinkle of the cowbells as the - animals hobbled around to find feed. We were to experience many such nights during our life in Mexico, nights spent in the tops of the mountains where we heard the cry of a lone wolf, or in the narrow box canyons where the call of the hoot owl 668 echoed up and down the walls. Mexican skies are filled with twinkling stars and a moon which seems to shine brighter than in any other place in the world, and which gives one a feeling for the beauty that led the psalmist to sing, "When I... Meditate on thee in the night watches." Colonia Juarez, which was to be our home, was situated in a picturesque spot in the bend of the Piedres Verdes River. Here we occupied the house built years before by Grandfather Snow. By adding three rooms and a lean-to it made a comfortable home for our family of eleven until we built our new home, supplied with running water, a built-in sink, and other conveniences which seemed to us like the acme of luxuly. Seldom a week passed without our entertaining "company" of some sort. We boarded the school teacher from the North; we entertained Mexican officials who came on business; we "kept" the Church officials who came for conferences. All of these visitors made it necessary for us children to be continuously on our best behavior. During those years our parents had to become accustomed to depending upon themselves. They nursed us through epidemics of measles and other childhood diseases without a doctor and with no medicine except home remedies. Many times it was necessary for mother to be left alone. With a sick child, but before leaving, father always put his hands upon the sick child's head and prayed for him. The members of the colonies also helped one another. If one mother had not enough food for her nursing baby, some other mother was found who would nurse the child and save its life. But occasionally, tragedies came, just as they are bound to come in any community. My father writes in his diary of a day when the corpses of two children and one man lay in the little town at the same time. All had died of what they called pneumonia. Up to the time we went to Juarez, there had never been a doctor in any of the colonies. A midwife delivered the babies with the usual degree of success. In case of accidents and diseases, the people had to depend on themselves. It is a miracle that so many recovered; but as is always. True when people are left to themselves, there were more prayers offered, and more administrations to the sick. All sorts of home remedies were used also, some of which probably did no good, but no harm either. In the spring, children were fed molasses and sulphur, with no knowledge of the valuable vitamin in molasses. For some troubles plasters of cooked onions were applied alternating with plasters of freshly killed chicken flesh. Many deaths, however, must have occurred due to lack of medical care and _ professional nursing. At one time the town suffered from an epidemic of typhoid fever. My father made the trip to El Paso, Texas, to consult a physician. Following his instructions, my sister and I, for the twelve weeks we were sick, tasted nothing but boiled milk and an antiseptic called 'acetezone," which we drank by the gallon. Our parents acted as our nurses, mother during the day and father at night. Once when my mother was suffering PIONEER LIFE IN OLD MEXICO 669 THE IVINS HOME IN COLONIA JUAREZ from lumbago, our neighbor came each day and bathed us. Later when the daughter-in-law of this same neighbor was stricken with typhoid, a child was born to her prematurely. 'There was no such thing as an incubator, but the child was saved by being wrapped in cotton and being fed with a spoon. Each day during this time of sickness, my mother carried to this neighbor two quarts of boiled milk. It was experiences such as these which cemented the people together in the strongest bonds of friendship. We were necessary to each other and no matter what our difficulties, something always brought us through. LL sorts of problems present themselves in a new community titles to lands, taxes, duties on imports, and social problems such as schools and entertainments. Trips had to be made to Chihuahua to request the governor not to collect taxes from colonists who had not resided there ten years, and to have reduced other taxes which were unequally assessed and very burdensome. Water rights had to be settled; lands surveyed; arrangements had to be made in the different colonies for payment of pasturage by those who had no range land but had cattle grazing on colony land all practical but difficult problems to adjust. Later, land had to be sought out for the establishment of other colonies, eight in all. There were six colonies settled in Chihuahua: Diaz, Dublan, and Juarez, with three located in the mountains, Chuichupa, Pacheco, and Garcia; and two colonies in Sonora: Oaxaca and Morelos. Large amounts of land ex- PARTY OF GOVERNOR AHUMADA AT HOME OF PRESIDENT IVINS Front row left to right: Member of Governor's party, Henry Eyring, Governor Ahumanda, President Ivins, the Jefe Politico of Casas Grandes.

Isted but very little water. The settling of all these problems required the men to be away from home and to travel in what we called a "buckboard," a vehicle none too comfortable. Most of these trips my father made alone. In his diary he speaks of one trip through "country wild and broken, sparsely settled, where the people look like a lot of rogues." Once as he camped at night, finding himself without matches, he put cotton from a camp quilt into his gun and fired it to start his campfire. According to my mother's record, father was at home only six months of the first two years in Mexico! We were always controlled by the jefe politico at Casas Grandes, about five miles away. For some reason eo we were never permitted to establish a municipality at Juarez, which resulted in all civic problems being decided by the Priesthood. Before long it was decided to assess the people to build an irrigation canal. Men were hired to do the work at twentyfive cents per hour or fifty cents foi a man with a team. Most families depended upon the well water foi household purposes. Practically every family had its own garden and milked its own cows. A flour mill was built to grind the farmers' wheat, a molasses mill to take the syrup from the cane. We had two "yeast women" who would exchange homemade yeast for a cup of flour or half-a-cup of sugar. As a rule, however, each household was independent in itself. 670 " PIONEER LIFE IN OLD MEXICO In the early days, the flour was very dark and the bread was heavy. Sugar was unrefined, about the color of our maple sugar, made in "pelous," cone-shaped pieces about two feet high, just the shape of the crown of a Mexican sombrero. One job of us children was to pulverize this sugar by using father's pestle and mortar. Several years later, after my father had succeeded in having the duties reduced, we imported refined sugar and flour from "the States." All the cooking was done on a wood-burning stove, the fires of which were started with chips gathered from the woodpile the night before by us children. Always on the back of the stove simmered a kettle of cracked wheat which made a perfect breakfast served with thick jersey cream and cream biscuits. For dinner, we had an abundance of crisp vegetables from our own garden, our own chickens or any meat that could be obtained at the time. Occasionally someone in the town killed a beef and we stood in line to get what we could. Wild meat could be obtained at any time of the year for there were no game laws, and always at Christmas time we had a wild turkey, if not killed by ourselves, then purchased from Mr. Stegal. I have no childhood recollection of tender, juicy beefsteaks, but plenty of tender venison. For supper at night, we had bread and milk, sometimes cornmeal mush, with plenty of fruit, molasses, and cheese. On our table was always a large pitcher of blue "separated" milk and a pitcher of thick yellow cream. We mixed our own milk according to the richness we desired. I long for those suppers again! 671 We made our own butter, more than we ate, and while it was plentiful mother "put it down" in fivegallon cans for the winter, when it was scarce. Butter to be "put down" must be worked over and over with a wooden ladle to separate all the milk, which would sour, from the fat, then stored in a cool under- - ground cellar. So far as I know, no fruit was ever preserved in glass jars, for in our town was a man who made tin cans. Our fresh fruit was preserved in quart cans and our preserves in five-gallon cans. These tin cans were made with a groove around the edge inside of which fitted a lid. To seal the can, melted resin was poured into the groove. When the can was opened, the resin, which was bitter, had to be chipped out with great care for if it got into the can the fruit would be bitter. We made our own candy from molasses and honey. After supper in the winter, we all sat together around the fireplace while father read to us stories of adventure of Stanley in Africa, of a carrier pigeon in the Spanish-American war, or else, together we worked puzzles and riddles from the Ladies' Home Journal. We had to supply our own entertaimment. Adult groups presented Othello, East Lynn, the opera Queen Esther, and other pretentious plays. I remember well the terror that gripped our young hearts as Othello plunged the dagger into the heart of the beautiful Desdemona; and we were touched emotionally when Oucen Esther sang with resignation, "T will go unto the king, and if I perish, I perish." Our daytime entertainment was of a most wholesome typehorseback riding, basketball, baseball, croquet, gathering wild walnuts, or hunting or fishing in the mountains where deer, turkeys, and other wild animals abounded. Once while driving through the mountains we saw a fox running away with a turkey, and on another occasion we drove through a forest with a fire burning on each side of the road while brightly colored parakeets chattered like monkeys as we passed along. The road into these extremely rough mountains was in places steep and of solid rock, and we always lightened the load for the horses by walking up the dugways. Around Mound Valley could be woven the romance of an ancient city. It is supposed that each of the many mounds covers a ruin. Up one of the mountains is one large cave containing about eighty rooms which once served as a home, as is indicated by its ollas and broken pottery. It was in one of these rooms that we found, one day, on the hard plaster of the wall, the name, "Erastus Snow," in grandfather's own handwriting. Near here, too, where my father prospected for ore were found, he says in his diary, "sixteen rich veins of copper-bearing quartz, not feasible to mine because the country is almost inaccessible, even on horseback." Not far away is located what he named the "Seven Star Mine," "'tich in silver ore, and caves of beautiful stalagmites and stalactites." All through these mountains are most beautiful flowers and ferns and in some places dellicious mountain trout. On these trips, we children, as we grew to manhood and womanhood, learned some of the most valuable lessons of our lives: a love of nature, an appreciation of the great outdoors, a knowledge of the bigness of the universe, proper treatment of animals as well as of each other. It was here, when we once saw five deer drinking in the stream near us, that father, himself a great hunter, said, "I could never shoot a deer if I could see its eyes." At another time when a guest we had taken with us began, on Sunday morning, to prepare his fishing tackle to go down to the stream, my father remarked casually, ''My hook never catches anything on Sunday." Our brothers spent much of their time in Mexico with their horses, the value of which can hardly be overestimated. Good manners in horses are just as important as good manners in men; both require long and constant training. An _ educated horse responds to the slightest move of its rider and struts and shows style according to his command. Nothing is more charming nor gives greater satisfaction than a well-trained horse, and unless it is his dog, a boy cannot have a finer friend. One of the most. Urgent needs of the colonies was a better school. A one-room building with a basement served as schoolhouse, meetinghouse, theater, and dance hall. It was this great need that led the people to assess themselves 8 per cent of their incomes to build the Juarez Stake Academy, which soon became an accredited school, its courses being accepted by colleges of the United States. The construction of better buildings had been made possible by having the duty lifted from such articles as nails and glass.  PIONEER LIFE IN OLD MEXICO 673 JUAREZ ACADEMY, COLONIA JUAREZ, CHIHUAHUA, MEXICO From the time the academy was built we had excellent teachers "from the States," who trained numerous local teachers. No one who grew up in the Mexican colonies can ever forget the lasting influence of those two great teachers, Guy C. Wilson and Ella Larsen. Every six months my parents did their marketing in E] Paso, Texas. To us it was the hub of the universe. Hats, shoes, cloth for dresses, and household articles were all purchased to last six months. Our dental work had to be done there also. Around my memories of El Paso always hovers the memory of the unwelcome dentist's chair. Thunder storms and floods are among my most vivid recollections of Mexico. One can never forget the frightening claps of thunder nor the floods that came down the Piedres Verdes River. The rain there literally "comes down in sheets." During the rainy season, which lasts all summer, a shower must be expected every day; but once in a while an unusually large cloud appears. One _ watches it grow larger and larger until it bursts, appearing to fall in one great bucketful. Soon up this river one hears a roaring sound which grows louder and louder until it reaches the town. It comes down the river bed like a great wall, carrying before it uprooted trees, barns, sometimes animals, and always in the old days before we built a permanent bridge, the extension bridge which swung across the river. In those days, if the flood came in the daytime, 'everyone ran to the banks of the river and watched. It meant that" until the river went down no one from our side could get to the store, WRECKAGE FROM A FLOOD OF THE PIEDRES VERDES RIVER nor to meetings, and the only way we could get messages to those on the other side was to stand on the bank and call through our cupped hands. When the flood came at night, it had for us children a more sinister aspect, as if some great monster were on the rampage, which would leave the shores strewn with wreckage as the water subsided. LL these experiences in a strange country had their price in money, toil, and even the length of life itself. Iam certain our friends and relatives visiting the colonies felt sorry for us, as we sometimes did for ourselves, and saw little to compensate for such a life of exile. Destiny sometimes plays a remarkable part in the lives of people and as the years go by our experiences in Mexico become richer. In spite of the many advantages that we missed in our youth, we have felt the genuine happiness that only the simplicity of the outdoors can bring; we had the great advantage of growing up among people who were basically fine, people who found their great pleasure with friends, riding through the mountains, climbing the hills, and boating down the river in the bright moonlight. The friends we made in that faraway country are the friends of our youth. We can always count on. Them. When they suffer, we suffer and are always ready with sympathy. With them, we saw this small Mormon town grow into a town of good homes, electric lights, telephones, with many other of the modern conveniences. Sometimes we wonder where all the present confusion is leading us. We, as parents, have studied the sciences of psychology and sociology that we feel are so important today, but we still have before us the task of meeting our problems as well as our parents met theirs in early Mormon life. They were "artists in the art of life," which someone has said is, after all, the end of all education.
