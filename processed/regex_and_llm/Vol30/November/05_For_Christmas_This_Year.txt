For Christmas This Year Nellie O. Parker Member of the Relief Society General Board E can bring a freshness of spirit to Christmas this year and a determination to make the best of the situation which the war has imposed upon us. Dearth of material things which we have been accustomed to use for our celebration, will challenge our resourcefulness. 'The metal which made trinkets and toys and baubles has long since gone to war, and restricted production of commodities and utilities, as well as a shortage of some types of food present other problems for us. But as a statesman recently reminded us, "A crisis can be made a time of opportunity if imagination and ingenuity are called into action." First of all we can give the day the full spiritual significance for which it was instituted by Christian people. "God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, and the Son gave Himself, even His life that the children of earth would know the right pattern of living which would bring them joy and peace in this life and hope for the eternity which follows.". Christmas is a commemoration of this day when His Son was born and it has been established by long custom on December 25 as the day on which we celebrate Christ's birth. This year we can make it a day of gratitude and thanksgiving to God. We can radiate more love and kindness by being more thoughtful and unselfish and by extending good will not only to our friends but to others, The' especially to the needy and less fortunate. You remember Jesus said, "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me." Jesus gave Himself unstintingly; we can give more of ourselves with our gifts and they will be greatly enriched, as "The gift without the giver is bare." We should try to make our gifts and decorations out of the things we have, rather than try to buy from a market of scarcity and often inferior quality. We should take stock of our resources, salvage and repair decorations of former years. From trunks and closets we may search for material which can be used to make articles which will make very acceptable presents. To mention a few of the things which can be made from used material there are rugsbraided, crocheted, woven, or made of small] pieces of cloth sewed in a design to a burlap or canvas back and outlined with thread. Old sweaters can be unraveled and made over into scarfs, mittens, caps, slippers, or afghans. Felt hats, the brighter the better, can be cut into pieces and appliqued on various things: for book markers; for children's Alpine sets hats, belts, and purses; for corsages, etc. Men's trousers, especially those belonging to boys who have gone into the service, which will be too small for them when they return, can be made into attractive little pleated skirts or jumper dresses for little girls. 'The seams can be hidden under the pleats and when the Page 675 676 articles are cleaned and _ beautifully pressed they will make as fine gifts as any purchased at a store. Good looking little boy suits can also be made. 'The secret lies in copying good patterns, sewing the suits carefully, then pressing them well. Adult coats can be made into smaller coats and some of them are very suitable for snowsuits. The best parts of an old bathrobe can be used in making a child's robe, especially if a little new material is used for collar and cuffs. Sugar sacks make very attractive luncheon sets when bleached and edged with colored rickrack or coarse lace, with a simple motif outlined in a corner to match the edging. Ten-pound sacks make a nice size for a place mat. One end may be decorated with a band of bright material and a motif repeating the same color may be placed on the other end. The smaller five-pound bags can be used for the napkins. These same size bags will make attractive quilt blocks, especially if dainty flowered percale is appliqued on them in some pretty design. Scrapbooks containing good continued magazine stories, collected and pasted neatly together with their illustrations will make welcome gifts for service men in shut-in places, such as on submarines or troop ships, or for convalescents in hospitals, etc. Collections of funny stories and riddles will also spread cheer and entertainment and will afford the maker plenty of opportunity for artistic expression in creating attractive covers for them. For favors, pieces of hard differentcolored candy, nuts, and raisins may be covered with bits of cellophane, twisting the ends to make a stem, and grouped together like a bunch of grapes or like a corsage with lace paper doily for a base. Be sure to make the whole house look festive and cheerful. A large bowl of pyracantha from the garden set before a mirror will give a beautiful red and green picture, or wreaths may be made from evergreen boughs, tied with red ribbon or chintz, and hung over a mirror or on the front door. Put candles at the base of the mirror. Frame a window, mirror, or archway with green and with red paper bells and festoons. A beautiful winter table scene may be made by whitening tumble weed with kalsomine and glitter and arranging it on a mirror with miniature reindeer, china birds, or little houses grouped around in front of it. The story of the first Christmas may be told by pictures cut from magazines and placed on the mantel or wall. Scotch tape will hold the pictures in place without injuring the wall. A display of beautiful Christmas cards of this and former years placed around the living room adds to the spirit of the occasion. If we make the things we do have interesting, striking, and abundant, then no one will miss the things we do not have. In addition, if we give full measure of friendliness, and if we reach out with kindness, then Christmas this year can be one which will in reality reflect the Christmas spirit. There are gifts from our kitchens we can share with othersa carrot pudding, a loaf of Boston brown bread, a cleverly arranged box or plate of cookies, a glass of jelly or a (Continued on page 694)
