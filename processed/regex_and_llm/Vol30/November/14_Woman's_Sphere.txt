Woman's Sphere Ramona W. Cannon HE Canadian American Women's Joint Committee on International Relations is now more than a year old. Through it the women of both countries are working for mutual appreciation and for cooperation between their governments and peoples through the medium of increased knowledge. At the American headquarters, One East 57th St., New York City, literature is available giving information on the Canadian people, geography, institutions, war efforts, and relations with the United States. WILHELMINA, Queen of the Netherlands for forty-five years last September 6, has been enthroned longer than ony other living monarch. Upon her fortunate escape to London from the invading Nazis, she announced, "Black, silent night has settled on yet another corner of this earth. Over free Holland the lights have gone out." She fled in order to "keep the banner aloft, unseen and yet ever present, for those who have lost their voice, but not -their hope nor their vision." 'The Netherlands Victoria, who ascended the throne at eighteen, ruled a scattered empire of 65,000,000 and had more gold, foreign exchange, and foreign secutities than any other nation in continental Europe  $6,000,000,000 worth. She had mote personal power than almost any other European monarchpower of absolute veto, of dissolving Parliament, of appointing AZ CD the fourteen members of the Council of State, which must be consulted on all legislation. Her personal courage and the social reformsthe most sweeping in Europewhich she carried through "with a maximum of efficiency and a minimum of noise" averted a socialist revolution after the last war. The democratic queen lived simply, cycled alone, skated and painted. Always high-principled and courageous, she also understands military and naval tactics, and foreign diplomats say they have never known any one with such a grasp of international affairs. Her own statesmanship is considered responsible for Holland's neutrality in the last war. Often she was better informed than her advising ministers and at once detected discrepancies or inaccuracies in their reports. She hopes for a just and Christian peace. May her voice be heard in peace negotiations! WOMEN who have added to our Indian lore are: Rita Green Thornton with her Indian opera Zunuiana; Jeanne L'Strange Cappel, descendant of the Chippewa tribe, with books on Indian legends; and Marion E. Gridley with Indian Legends of American Scenes. CORNELIA OTIS SKINNER'S delightful autobiographical story, Our Hearts Were Young and Gay has been among the season's best sellers and is to be filmed.
