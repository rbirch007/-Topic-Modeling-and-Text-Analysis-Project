RELIEF SOCIETY WAR AND WELFARE ACTIVITIES (Continued from the October Magazine)
Central States Mission
The beautiful and interesting quilt top, reproduced on the opposite page, was presented to the General Board of the Relief Society by Mrs. Mary A. Stephens of Independence, Missouri. Sister Edna M. Bowman, who with her husband, President John F. Bowman, recently returned from the Central States Mission where she presided for four years over the Mission Relief Society, brought the quilt top to the General Board office, and related the interesting story of how it came into Sister Stephens' possession.
Sister Stephens, a convert to the Church from the Southern States, had been very active in Relief Society since her residence in Independence. At a social gathering of Relief Society sisters in her home some fifteen years ago, Miss Katherine McCowen was among the guests. Miss Kate, as she was called, was an old friend of Sister Stephens although she was not a member of the Church. During the conversation she casually mentioned that she had a quilt top among her possessions that had been made by her mother and Mrs. Oliver Cowdery. The sisters asked to see it, and a few weeks later Miss McCowen showed them this quilt top which they all greatly admired.
The quilt is made of red and gold percale blocks on unbleached muslin and is beautifully stitched. Miss Kate's mother said that most of the piece work was done by Mrs. Cowdery. Sister Stephens, fully appreciating its historic as well as its artistic value, asked Miss Kate what she intended to do with it. Miss Kate jokingly replied, "I will will it to you when I die."
During this past summer Miss Kate died at the age of eighty-five. Among her things was found this quilt top, with a note saying that it was to be given to Mrs. Mary A. Stephens.
The General Board expresses its appreciation to Sister Stephens for this beautiful and historic gift, and also to Sister Edna M. Bowman for delivering the quilt top. It will be added to the collection of valued historic articles now being preserved by the General Board.
Rexburg Stake (Idaho)
The following excerpt relating to war work is from the 1942 narrative report of Lucile Cullimore, stake Relief Society secretary: "Due to the war the women of the stake have been urged and encouraged to help in all commendable war endeavors and the wards were asked wherever possible to organize as units to do Red Cross sewing. Those wards who could were encouraged to buy war bonds, which was also done by the stake board. Home-nursing courses, through the Red Cross, were also sponsored by the Relief Society and emergency first-aid nursing kits are being purchased in all wards. A hospital bed was purchased second hand jointly by the stake board and the four wards of Rexburg. Church welfare assignments have also been well executed."
South Los Angeles Stake (California)
Hazel Dunford, counselor to President Hazel T. NeVille, is in charge of sewing in the South Los Angeles Stake. She recently sent the following report: "We are happy to report all our wards have qualified 100 per cent in our emergency program. Each has a very large supply of medical supplies, more than filling the list suggested by the General Board, together with splints, cots, blankets, quilts, sheets, pillows, and emergency baby layettes.
"Seven of our wards have, under Red Cross instructors, completed the home-nursing course, and many more the Red Cross first-aid course, all outside of regular Relief Society time. We also sponsored a table at Red Cross headquarters, making surgical dressings.
"We have just completed our welfare assignment of forty quilts, all of new outing flannel and part-wool bats.
"The Relief Society stake board had printed and distributed to all homes of the stake 1,700 valuable folders on nutrition.
"From money raised as a stake board project, we have bought a $500 war bond and have also beautifully refurnished the ladies' lounge in the stake house.
"Our attendance has decreased due to so many women working, but the Relief Society visiting teachers still contact the homes 100 per cent in each ward."
Maricopa Stake (Arizona)
The following excellent narrative statement of its 1942 bedding and canning project accompanied the Maricopa Stake Relief Society annual report for 1942: "The bedding project which began in December 1941 was continued in 1942. Survey letters were distributed by visiting teachers to all women in Relief Society, listing the suggestive amount of linens and bedding adequate for a two years' supply. Each family was asked to return the survey form with the estimated number of each article they wished to purchase to complete their budget.
"The Relief Society stake board financed the project. Large purchases were made, some merchants offering discounts. Dozens of sheets, pillowcases, and other linens were bought. These were distributed to the wards according to their needs, and were purchased by the sisters. In wards where families were not able to buy these supplies, the ward officers were urged to work out a plan to assist the sisters. New pieces and used clothing were donated for quilt tops. Several hundred dollars' worth of outing flannel was bought and distributed at a reasonable price.
"At cotton-ginning season, the stake board was able to buy many bales of cotton, which was later felted in Phoenix. This cotton was sold to the sisters at cost, which was 18c to 20c a pound.
"Ward quilting, group quilting, and neighborhood quilting parties of all kinds took place during the summer. The wards were unable to give us a complete count of the bedding purchased or of the quilts made. At the last incomplete count there were nearly 1,300 quilts.
"In the early summer of 1942, the Relief Society stake board attempted a canning project. The purpose of the project was to locate available fruits and vegetables and stimulate the women to put away as much food as possible for the future. The committee in charge contacted local grocers and growers in order that they might obtain such produce in sufficient quantities at a fair price.
"Strawberries, apricots, tomatoes, and corn were canned. From a large farm south of Chandler, truck loads of culled new potatoes were purchased by the stake. These were bought and canned by the sisters in their homes. Later, carrots, cabbages, and cauliflowers were made available through the stake Relief Society. Women were urged to dry figs and corn, cure dates, and can all produce obtainable in the locality. Thus a very commendable beginning for intensive home canning was started, and many of our sisters are thankful for the extra food on their shelves."
Long Beach Stake (California)
Pearl C. Miner, president of the Long Beach Stake Relief Society, reported in June 1943: "Last week we were invited to present the program at the Victory Stand in Long Beach. Much publicity had been given our program by the local newspapers. Our municipal band played, musical talent was from our own Church members, and the stake Relief Society president was given the privilege of explaining the Welfare Program of our Church. We had a table on which were displayed samples of the various fruits, vegetables, tuna, vinegar, extracts, and soups canned in our welfare projects. We explained the purpose of the Welfare Program, and how each unit selected the projects suitable to its own locality and according to its ability to produce. We showed them our honey from the honey project of Santa Ana, the sorghum made from cane grown by our Huntington Beach group. Also, we displayed a number of our quilts that are made from good used wool pieces that have been cleaned and pressed and made into quilt blocks, and a few of the one hundred beautiful rayon dresses made as part of our welfare assignment. We sold forty thousand dollars worth of war bonds at this program.
"We have our first-aid kits in each ward. We are collecting articles for our loan closet, and think it is a splendid idea. Many of our women have completed their first-aid, nursing, or nutrition courses, and we hope to organize a number of home-nursing classes under the Red Cross in the near future.
"Each of our three Long Beach wards sponsors a bond and stamp booth downtown. We work through the stores, but our booths are out on the sidewalk. We have one of our ladies in each booth every day of the week, and have had one booth since the first of last November. We are doing a good work in our sales."
Oneida Stake (Idaho)
Stella W. Dalley, president of the Dayton Ward, reports: "The accompanying photograph shows a typical quilting held by the Dayton Ward Relief Society during 1943. From January 1943 until June 8, 1943, 32 quilts were quilted by the ward Relief Society. Of this number, 4 were made for the Church Welfare Program, 5 were made for the ward Relief Society and 23 were quilted for ward members at a small fee to help the members secure adequate bedding for their families.
"The average attendance at the quiltings was 22. Seven full-day quiltings were held and 6 half-day quiltings on work-and-business days. Over 1,000 hours of quilting and sewing were done by the members of this ward Relief Society.
"This project was directly in charge of Second Counselor Kenna Bergeson, and sewing leaders Reta Virkbride and Alta Stuart."
Oakland Stake (California)
A very interesting report on war work and the Relief Society, written by Ruth S. Hilton, president of Oakland Stake Relief Society, which would ordinarily appear with this group of reports in "Notes from the Field" was printed in the June-July issue of the Magazine, page 424, as a highlight to the general secretary's annual report. Reference is made to this issue of the Magazine for this stake's excellent report of war work.
Snowflake Stake (Arizona)
The following excerpt is from the narrative annual report for 1942 of the Snowflake Stake Relief Society, of which Leonora S. Rogers is president. "In June, through the help of the ward Societies, the stake board donated fifteen complete temple suits to the Arizona Temple. In July, a shower of bed linen and dishes for our local maternity hospital was giventhere were 24 bed sheets, 11 pairs of pillowcases, and 142 dishes. Another donation of 179 quarts of bottled fruit and vegetables was given to the hospital on Thanksgiving Day.
"During the summer work-and-business meetings, the wards made and remodeled over 300 articles of clothing for the stake bishops' storehouse. We had no dentist available for our annual check-up on teeth, therefore the wards invested their health fund donations in war bonds, to the amount of $1,042.72.
"Many of our wards are taking courses in Red Cross work and nutrition."
Phoenix Stake (Arizona)
Mele D. Mortensen, president of Phoenix Stake Relief Society, reported in connection with this stake's 1942 annual report: "We had a welfare project in which we made an effort to have every home in our stake completely supplied with bedding and one year's supply of food. About 1,500 pounds of beans were bought and distributed in the stake.
"Blankets to the value of $200 were bought from Utah mills and sold to the people of our stake. We had a paper project and gathered tons of newspapers and magazines and cleared $160. We also had a sweet potato project and grew about 1 2/3 acres of potatoes. It was not a financial success, but we cleared a little more than it cost us. We only wish we had it this year as potatoes are so high. We have a wonderful group of sisters on our board and are proud of their testimonies. They desire to do their part in helping to carry forward the Lord's work. We hold a board meeting about every five or six weeks, and at each meeting we quilt a quilt for one of the wards to help in their welfare assignment.
"As you know, our stake is new and we have had a stake building erected in connection with our Third Ward. In this building there were some rooms provided for the stake Relief Society, and we have been trying to furnish those rooms. We have secured some of the furniture and are able to hold all of our board meetings there now."
Chicago Stake (Illinois)
Lois Astin, stake Relief Society president, and Elizabeth W. Hansen, stake secretary-treasurer, jointly submitted the 1942 narrative report from which the following excerpts are taken: "Through the splendid cooperation of the wards and branches our canning and sewing projects have been very successful. To date, 586 articles of children's and women's clothing have been completed and approximately 2,000 quarts of fruits and vegetables have been canned. These have been turned over to the respective bishops and the stake welfare committee. One hundred twenty-nine yards of outing flannel were given out November 23 at our quarterly conference for the making of children's pajamas. These will be returned February 27 when our sisters come in for conference. One branch, besides participating in the stake sewing project, made quilts for eight of its members. Country stores, dinners, bazaars, and apron sales have been given to help the wards and branches raise cash for their Church welfare assignments."
Inglewood Stake (California)
Josephine Prestwich, stake Relief Society president, included in her 1942 narrative report the following statement: "Our wards had a Relief Society bedding project last summer and each ward was asked to make 6 or more quilts, one dozen sheets, pillowcases, towels, and at least 3 layettes. They were also instructed in making bandages, and some of our women have attended first-aid classes."
The University of the Home (Continued from page 660)
strict accountability any son or daughter who casts off an aged father or mother.
All institutions of learning enjoy the inspiration of a well-selected school song. A song that might be appropriately used in the sanctity of the home because it represents the epitome of students' relationship to their Heavenly Father, is, "I'll go where you want me to go, dear Lord, over mountain or plain or sea. I'll say what you want me to say, dear Lord. I'll be what you want me to be."
And its motto, "Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old he will not depart from it," will prepare the reapers of a questionable future harvest to meet the issues of life, to solve its problems, and to achieve fully a destiny of fruitful service.
For Christmas This Year (Continued from page 676)
bottle of mustard pickles wrapped in red cellophane or other Christmas paper. Tie the package with a ribbon and a little original Christmas jingle and it will be gratefully received in these days of food rationing. One recipient of a pudding last year thought it so attractive she hung it on her Christmas tree.
Speaking of Christmas trees, if you have very few baubles or decorations for a tree this year there are many things that you can make that will be interesting as well as pretty. Strings of popcorn may be tinted with gelatine coloring and alternated frequently with colored peanuts. Popcorn balls or dainty popcorn baskets made with loops of string fastened inside so they can be hung on the tree make attractive decorations, also.
Fancy Christmas bread and cookies can be made in various shapes, such as stars, reindeer, rabbits, airplanes, Santa Claus, nursery characters, etc., and decorated with white and colored frostings and hung on the tree. Use cookie cutters or else cut out your own patterns with a sharp knife. Crochet red mesh bags or miniature stockings to hold candy, nuts, and cookies for the tree, or make pretty little boxes to hold the goodies. One of these containers given to children who view the tree, will delight the youngsters.
